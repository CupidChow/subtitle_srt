00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,000
(Crazy Handsome Rich)
(Episode 2)

2
00:03:00,031 --> 00:03:00,930
Warning.

3
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,922
This series is created from imagination.

4
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:05,727
It is suitable for everyone.

5
00:03:05,844 --> 00:03:06,844
Is that right?

6
00:03:07,538 --> 00:03:12,162
Anyway, our content isn't realistic.
We focus on assumptions.

7
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,920
The previous episode
of Crazy Handsome Rich.

8
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,160
This is Sin, your family's new butler.

9
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,680
Are you Sin?

10
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,360
Yes.

11
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,440
Do you know
that we don't allow women here?

12
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,040
Yes.

13
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,600
I'm a man.

14
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,560
How can I be sure
that you're not in disguise?

15
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,720
By the way,

16
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,800
you don't look like your brother.

17
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,560
What should we do, Thod?

18
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,160
Take off your clothes.

19
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,880
Huh?

20
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,160
Why should a butler strip naked?

21
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,440
Hey.

22
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,123
I don't want to be a butler anymore.

23
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,480
But it's the rule here.

24
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,960
It's a crazy rule!

25
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,592
It's so embarrassing!

26
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,960
I'm so sorry that I didn't tell you first.

27
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,840
But he's very strict.

28
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,320
I'm out.

29
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,680
I'm going home.

30
00:04:10,941 --> 00:04:11,855
Hey.

31
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,240
This is my special item!

32
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,677
You're rethinking now, aren't you?

33
00:04:26,325 --> 00:04:27,130
Hey.

34
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,600
This necklace.

35
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,960
This is the necklace

36
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,800
that will lead you to your soulmate.

37
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,280
After this day, your destiny

38
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,920
will change.

39
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,400
Be prepared to handle it well.

40
00:04:47,275 --> 00:04:47,979
Oh.

41
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,800
This?

42
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,800
This is Mr. Thod's necklace.

43
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,480
I'm going to put it away.

44
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,720
What is it?

45
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,360
Nothing.

46
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,280
Are you sure about that?

47
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,520
So will you go back inside?

48
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:05,104
So?

49
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:07,997
Come on. You're overthinking.

50
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,040
I haven't found my soulmate,
how can I leave?

51
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,280
Mr. Butler.

52
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,680
The way he called me

53
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,640
shows that he wants to stay longer.

54
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,480
Where is my room?

55
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,960
Why?

56
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,120
He probably wants to stay.

57
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,200
Follow me.

58
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,400
A love song.

59
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,400
It's amazing.

60
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,560
I'll keep playing then.

61
00:06:06,778 --> 00:06:07,824
Huh?

62
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,240
Haven't you put your things away?

63
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,280
I'm sorry.

64
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,800
Please excuse us.

65
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,760
- Mister.
- What?

66
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,520
Should I put this necklace away?

67
00:06:23,381 --> 00:06:25,800
Necklace? I thought it was a chain
for the door lock.

68
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,025
Okay.

69
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,480
Butler Sin.

70
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,280
Yes?

71
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,920
So let's keep playing.

72
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,127
I'll keep playing.

73
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,800
Where is he taking me?

74
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,560
We've arrived at the bridal house.

75
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,000
I mean his room.

76
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,240
Come on.

77
00:07:04,955 --> 00:07:05,862
Hurry up.

78
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,280
Stop being surprised.

79
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,037
So this is my room.

80
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,280
Wow, it's so nice!

81
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,160
Here. This is the butler's dormitory.

82
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,316
You should get some rest inside.

83
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,280
We must prepare snacks
for the misters at 13:15.

84
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:22,840
Okay.

85
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,320
Good luck.

86
00:07:25,647 --> 00:07:26,343
Okay, let's go.

87
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,682
He'll become rich.

88
00:07:40,532 --> 00:07:41,907
Is this the bedroom?

89
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,579
It's so beautiful.

90
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,164
I'll stay as long as I want.

91
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,280
It's so luxurious.

92
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,360
This necklace?

93
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,680
Was the fortune teller saying the truth?

94
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,085
Mister.

95
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,640
Should I put this necklace away?

96
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,151
Necklace?

97
00:08:14,425 --> 00:08:15,206
Huh?

98
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,880
Okay.

99
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,280
Why are you smiling?

100
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,600
Or you want to compete
and see whose teeth are whiter?

101
00:08:24,342 --> 00:08:25,225
No.

102
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,160
You forgot this.

103
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,720
Oh, thank you, sir.

104
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,954
Never mind, I'll put it there.

105
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,783
Mister.

106
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,380
My name is Thep.

107
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yes, sir.

108
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,640
Thank you, Mr. Thep.

109
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,360
Are you really Butler Sorn's brother?

110
00:08:51,756 --> 00:08:52,545
Yes, I am.

111
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:55,162
It's weird.

112
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,526
I never knew...

113
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,184
Knew...

114
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:07,653
Knew what, sir?

115
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,280
I never knew you were this handsome.

116
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,480
Oh, I was handsome since birth.

117
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,507
Thank you so much, Mr. Thep.

118
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,412
You are so handsome too.

119
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,440
Thanks. Everyone says so.

120
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,080
When you're with me,

121
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,280
don't be tensed.

122
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,360
You can talk to me.

123
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,960
- I don't have many friends.
- I see.

124
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:34,120
Yes, sir.

125
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,600
Because I've always stayed home,

126
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,320
I don't go out much.

127
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,427
That's the lock-shaped necklace.

128
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,680
Can my key unlock it?

129
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,640
What are you staring at? Hey.

130
00:09:48,698 --> 00:09:49,542
Yes?

131
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:51,510
Never mind.

132
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:54,486
Do you like building things?

133
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,280
Come to my room when you're free.

134
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,368
I have something to show you.

135
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,040
Yes, sir.

136
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,680
I'm sorry.

137
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,815
Okay, I won't bother you any longer.

138
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,184
You should get some rest.

139
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,280
Yes, sir.

140
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,413
Hello, Mamuang. What's up!?

141
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,683
Did Butler Sorn not tell you

142
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,480
that before you enter my room,

143
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,867
you must knock the door three times?

144
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,417
Please leave.

145
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,920
Yes, sir.

146
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,110
He didn't tell me.

147
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,107
Did Butler Sorn not tell you

148
00:11:56,495 --> 00:11:57,455
that before you enter my room,

149
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,640
you must knock the door three times?

150
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,372
So I'll know that you're entering.

151
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,352
You must wait
for my permission to enter.

152
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,800
Yes, sir.

153
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,056
Wait.

154
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,280
Please understand
that while you are here,

155
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,560
you must strictly follow
the house rules.

156
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,520
Yes, Mr. Thod.

157
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:27,920
Here, sir.

158
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,440
I think the tea is cold now.

159
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,240
I'll replace it.

160
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,680
Never mind. You should go do your work.

161
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,200
Yes, sir.

162
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,374
Not good.

163
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,680
Who's that?

164
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,880
So cute.

165
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,120
Mr. Butler.

166
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,480
Yes?

167
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,120
Come here.

168
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,320
Yes, sir.

169
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,200
Get me some water.

170
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,880
Yes, sir.

171
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,367
Wait.

172
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,304
I want cold water and no glass.

173
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,240
I like to drink

174
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,318
from the bottle.

175
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,920
Yes, sir.

176
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,760
(Next Break)
Wait a minute.

177
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,720
Here.

178
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,440
Why?

179
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,600
It's your job, right?

180
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,534
Mister.

181
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,596
Your water, sir.

182
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,200
That was fast.

183
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,440
Let me take my gloves off.

184
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,600
So I can drink easily.

185
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,080
Why are you still standing?
Put it on the table.

186
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:44,720
Yes, sir.

187
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,800
Take this.

188
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,280
Yes.

189
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,920
Come on. Give it to me.

190
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,880
Mister?

191
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,600
Thad.

192
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,040
Thad like a bomb?

193
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,440
My name is Thad.

194
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,480
Nice to meet you, Mr. Thad.

195
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,579
Give it to me. I'm thirsty.

196
00:15:33,619 --> 00:15:35,869
He's handsome
even when he's drinking water.

197
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,769
Very handsome.

198
00:15:46,592 --> 00:15:47,834
He's easy on the eyes.

199
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,881
What's wrong?

200
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,880
Nothing, sir. I'm sorry.

201
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,680
Please excuse me, sir.

202
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,920
Who's calling me?

203
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,640
Is that a phone? He can't use it.

204
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,320
Hello?

205
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,440
Yo! What's up?

206
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,280
Wait a minute. I'm working.

207
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,400
What? Working?

208
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,800
I'll call you back.

209
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,640
Okay.

210
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,520
I'm hanging up.

211
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,394
I have to teach him a lesson.

212
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,280
This is very close.

213
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,203
There's one more rule.

214
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,288
Do not use your phone

215
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,026
in this house.

216
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,520
Huh?

217
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,920
- What are you wondering about?
- Oh.

218
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,200
I am sorry.

219
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,120
He's looking at me.
Does he have a problem?

220
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,245
Does he want to fight
or fall in love?

221
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,120
Let me tell you. I'm brutal.

222
00:17:05,321 --> 00:17:07,524
How awesome.

223
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,120
Here

224
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,214
and there. Yes.

225
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,840
Over here. Yes.

226
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,120
Put it right here too.

227
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,640
Okay, well done.

228
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,558
Good work.

229
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,605
All right. Good.

230
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,680
Good job.

231
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,000
This looks good.

232
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:48,680
Yes.

233
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,880
You learn the job very quickly.

234
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,320
Ring, ring.

235
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,640
Oh, we must ring a bell in this house.

236
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,280
Put it down and wait for them.

237
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,400
This is a really cool door, see?

238
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,527
Hello, sir.

239
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,200
Please.

240
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,920
Please.

241
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,839
Take a seat.

242
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,720
Let's drink tea.

243
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,760
The tea is very fragrant.

244
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,640
Butler Sorn.

245
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,040
Yes, sir?

246
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,440
When are you going?

247
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,440
Is he chasing me away?

248
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,680
Well, the day after tomorrow.

249
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,440
Okay, the day after tomorrow.

250
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,880
Butler Sin.

251
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,960
Butler Sin!

252
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,000
Yes, sir?

253
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,960
Take care of the house
as Butler Sorn has been doing.

254
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,920
Yes, Mr. Thod.

255
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,440
If you don't know how,

256
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,400
I can teach you.

257
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,840
Ahem.

258
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,160
Do you want a lozenge?

259
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,040
He's always saying that.

260
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,480
Ouch, the tea is too hot.

261
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,520
Oh, no.

262
00:19:27,943 --> 00:19:30,701
Who's calling again?

263
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,135
- You're not going to stop?
- It's not me.

264
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,240
I told you not to use your phone, right?

265
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,320
Sorry, Thod.

266
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,080
It's mine.

267
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,600
I've told you many times

268
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,320
that bringing in a phone
is strictly prohibited.

269
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,160
Damn it.

270
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,960
Calm down, Thod.

271
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,680
See?

272
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,280
I'm sorry.

273
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,440
You caused this problem.

274
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,520
I'm sorry.

275
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,120
Well...

276
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
Don't talk to me.

277
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,440
I'm mad.

278
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,059
Well...

279
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,826
Will I get in trouble?

280
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,400
I shouldn't have brought the phone in.

281
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,944
I will find Thot.

282
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,120
I don't feel like eating with a frown.

283
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,760
Troublemaker.

284
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,520
I'm sorry, Mr. Thad.

285
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,815
You don't know me well.

286
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,560
Go there.

287
00:20:34,955 --> 00:20:37,280
Oh, he's getting rid of me.

288
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,735
I'm going, troublemaker.

289
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,120
What are they doing?
He should get back to work.

290
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,237
Talking verbally? I'm confused.

291
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,771
Didn't I tell you to put it away?

292
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,664
Yes, sir.

293
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,480
I'm sorry.

294
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,440
I'll put it away now.

295
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,640
I won't let you.

296
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,360
I am sulking.

297
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,280
He won't let me?

298
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,680
I want to put it away,
but he won't let me.

299
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,640
I'll give it to you.

300
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,653
Is he gone? Yes.

301
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,840
So cute.

302
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,680
He smells good too.

303
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,200
Damn it, Mamuang.

304
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,400
Now you won't call me, huh?

305
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,840
Hello.

306
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,935
How are you doing there?

307
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,200
I want to visit you.

308
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,360
No.

309
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,960
The rules here are very strict.

310
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,880
If Mister finds out, he will kill me.

311
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,000
Why?

312
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,760
Why don't you answer
my calls these days?

313
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,143
It's against the rules here.

314
00:21:47,635 --> 00:21:49,840
- We cannot use mobile phones.
- Huh?

315
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,403
Okay then.

316
00:21:52,513 --> 00:21:54,567
Let's talk later.

317
00:21:54,641 --> 00:21:55,454
Okay.

318
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:56,287
I have to get back to work.

319
00:21:56,287 --> 00:21:57,029
Okay.

320
00:21:59,991 --> 00:22:01,179
I forgot.

321
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:04,023
Did anyone see that?

322
00:22:05,055 --> 00:22:06,727
Probably not.

323
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:22,430
Wow, the room is so clean.

324
00:22:22,853 --> 00:22:25,982
It's so clean, what am I supposed to do?

325
00:22:30,054 --> 00:22:32,437
Let's walk around.
There might be something to do.

326
00:22:38,616 --> 00:22:40,168
This is the Mister's necklace.

327
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,658
- Hey.
- Yes?

328
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:53,157
Please understand
that while you are here,

329
00:22:53,182 --> 00:22:55,134
you must strictly follow
the house rules.

330
00:22:56,822 --> 00:22:58,487
Yes, Mr. Thod.

331
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:00,977
What are you doing?

332
00:23:02,453 --> 00:23:03,102
Oh.

333
00:23:04,336 --> 00:23:06,167
I'm cleaning the room.

334
00:23:07,371 --> 00:23:08,465
Also...

335
00:23:09,801 --> 00:23:11,527
I've come to get your used clothes.

336
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,980
- Yes?
- It's suspicious.

337
00:23:16,086 --> 00:23:18,430
- That's it, sir.
- He snuck into my room.

338
00:23:18,984 --> 00:23:20,906
- Hey.
- Hold on.

339
00:23:21,211 --> 00:23:21,847
Hey.

340
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:23,593
Yes?

341
00:23:24,601 --> 00:23:26,132
If you're going to do laundry,

342
00:23:26,157 --> 00:23:27,989
take this as well.

343
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:30,919
Oh, wow.

344
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:33,708
His muscles are tight.

345
00:23:33,733 --> 00:23:35,953
Mr. Thad.

346
00:23:45,922 --> 00:23:46,820
I'll leave it to you.

347
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:50,538
- Please excuse me.
- Hey.

348
00:23:50,682 --> 00:23:51,885
Hold on.

349
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,057
That's not it.

350
00:24:05,701 --> 00:24:06,873
Take this too.

351
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:11,427
He not only took off his top.

352
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,247
But he also took off his pants.

353
00:24:14,067 --> 00:24:15,973
See?

354
00:24:17,287 --> 00:24:18,415
Here.

355
00:24:21,756 --> 00:24:22,420
Why?

356
00:24:23,076 --> 00:24:24,178
Isn't it your duty?

357
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:27,278
Yes, sir.

358
00:24:28,457 --> 00:24:30,676
Please excuse me.

359
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,461
Can I go now?

360
00:24:41,696 --> 00:24:42,915
I'll get going.

361
00:24:45,728 --> 00:24:46,634
How awesome.

362
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:49,693
I'm so fit and firm.

363
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:08,073
I was almost blinded.
This smells like fabric softener.

364
00:25:08,261 --> 00:25:09,120
Ouch.

365
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:10,659
I'm sorry, Mr. Thep.

366
00:25:11,447 --> 00:25:12,370
Are you okay, sir?

367
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,047
I'm fine.

368
00:25:14,649 --> 00:25:16,502
I'm okay, I guess.

369
00:25:16,907 --> 00:25:19,687
What are you doing
at the butler's dormitory?

370
00:25:21,126 --> 00:25:23,767
Well... I have a favor to ask.

371
00:25:24,001 --> 00:25:25,618
A favor to ask me?

372
00:25:26,368 --> 00:25:28,469
May I borrow your phone?

373
00:25:28,603 --> 00:25:29,470
Huh?

374
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:31,948
- Huh?
- You heard correctly.

375
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:35,447
But your family is wealthy.

376
00:25:36,007 --> 00:25:38,927
My phone is pretty old.

377
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:42,073
I'm rich, but I don't have a phone.

378
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:43,964
Having a phone
is against the rules here.

379
00:25:44,698 --> 00:25:46,745
That's why I want to borrow yours.

380
00:25:46,815 --> 00:25:48,699
He's so rich, but doesn't have a phone.

381
00:25:49,026 --> 00:25:50,112
Please.

382
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,007
Please let me borrow yours.

383
00:25:53,128 --> 00:25:56,018
Please. I'm begging you.

384
00:25:56,287 --> 00:25:58,979
- Please.
- Fine.

385
00:25:59,722 --> 00:26:00,847
Yes!

386
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:06,826
Thank you so much.

387
00:26:10,646 --> 00:26:12,357
It's time for Mr. Thod's coffee.

388
00:26:12,753 --> 00:26:14,933
Please excuse me.

389
00:26:16,285 --> 00:26:18,011
Sure, don't let Thod wait.

390
00:26:18,589 --> 00:26:19,207
Yes, sir.

391
00:26:20,097 --> 00:26:22,175
Okay, all right.

392
00:26:22,532 --> 00:26:24,470
Now...

393
00:26:24,687 --> 00:26:27,556
- This is very important, Butler Sorn.
- Yes, sir.

394
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:30,487
Come in.

395
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,158
Excuse me.

396
00:26:49,156 --> 00:26:50,757
Your coffee, sir.

397
00:26:53,686 --> 00:26:54,858
Put it on the side.

398
00:26:55,748 --> 00:26:58,134
Okay, I'll move it to the left.

399
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:00,639
Oh, dear.

400
00:27:01,554 --> 00:27:02,491
The handle.

401
00:27:03,545 --> 00:27:06,256
- The handle.
- Okay, I'll move it.

402
00:27:09,606 --> 00:27:11,262
Move a bit to the right.
Make it straight.

403
00:27:15,902 --> 00:27:17,184
Okay, that's enough.

404
00:27:17,395 --> 00:27:20,043
- Is this okay?
- Leave.

405
00:27:21,168 --> 00:27:21,838
Okay.

406
00:27:26,065 --> 00:27:27,565
I'll leave it to you tomorrow.

407
00:27:31,267 --> 00:27:31,994
Of course, sir.

408
00:27:32,188 --> 00:27:33,477
Okay, good.

409
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,688
We must keep him here.

410
00:27:42,773 --> 00:27:43,898
Yes, sir.

411
00:27:46,515 --> 00:27:49,343
(Next break)
What is this ringing sound?

412
00:27:49,454 --> 00:27:50,196
Which room?

413
00:27:52,532 --> 00:27:53,204
Damn it.

414
00:28:18,032 --> 00:28:21,883
Why do the three masters
all have the lock necklaces?

415
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:27,633
What should I do?

416
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:30,334
How can I unlock one of them?

417
00:28:33,475 --> 00:28:34,367
Wait.

418
00:28:35,264 --> 00:28:37,499
Or... should I steal it?

419
00:28:38,225 --> 00:28:38,850
Yes.

420
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:40,887
I must steal it.

421
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,167
I should go to bed.

422
00:28:43,327 --> 00:28:44,567
I must get up early tomorrow.

423
00:28:45,287 --> 00:28:46,412
Keep fighting.

424
00:28:46,514 --> 00:28:47,459
Let's start the plan.

425
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,217
Damn it. What's this ringing sound?

426
00:28:59,942 --> 00:29:01,751
Where is this sound coming from?

427
00:29:02,813 --> 00:29:04,711
Where is it coming from?

428
00:29:04,751 --> 00:29:07,212
It's so late. I was about to go to bed.

429
00:29:10,486 --> 00:29:12,040
Where is it coming from?

430
00:29:15,132 --> 00:29:15,968
From which room?

431
00:29:17,226 --> 00:29:18,296
Mr. Thod?

432
00:29:19,273 --> 00:29:20,233
Mr. Thad?

433
00:29:21,437 --> 00:29:22,741
Or Mr. Thep?

434
00:29:24,108 --> 00:29:24,804
Damn it.

435
00:29:29,793 --> 00:29:32,605
Yes! A future invention is almost done.

436
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:33,667
Yes!

437
00:29:33,722 --> 00:29:36,620
I will get a Nobel prize for this.

438
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,689
Hey. Why are you still up?

439
00:29:43,087 --> 00:29:45,063
Didn't you call for me, Mr. Thep?

440
00:29:45,345 --> 00:29:46,876
No. Look at this.

441
00:29:47,282 --> 00:29:49,595
- No, it wasn't me.
- Wrong room.

442
00:29:49,858 --> 00:29:51,175
I don't know why I would call you.

443
00:29:51,698 --> 00:29:53,972
Then... I'm sorry.

444
00:29:54,066 --> 00:29:55,597
Huh? Okay.

445
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,597
Let's put it back.

446
00:30:03,742 --> 00:30:05,015
It's coming from this room.

447
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,532
Let's have a look.

448
00:30:09,368 --> 00:30:10,688
It stopped ringing.

449
00:30:12,587 --> 00:30:13,188
Huh?

450
00:30:14,156 --> 00:30:15,594
Maybe it wasn't from here.

451
00:30:15,992 --> 00:30:17,039
Hey.

452
00:30:18,007 --> 00:30:19,273
He's in my room again.

453
00:30:19,468 --> 00:30:22,140
Don't think it will be easy to leave.

454
00:30:23,887 --> 00:30:26,515
I... I'm sorry, sir.

455
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,785
He's so close to me again.

456
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:34,489
How dare you enter my room at night.

457
00:30:36,895 --> 00:30:38,465
Well...

458
00:30:39,112 --> 00:30:41,909
I thought you were calling for me.

459
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:44,721
Really?

460
00:30:46,432 --> 00:30:47,213
Yes, sir.

461
00:30:48,909 --> 00:30:50,166
Then...

462
00:30:52,327 --> 00:30:55,633
Oh, dear. I'm slipping.

463
00:30:57,867 --> 00:30:58,555
All right.

464
00:31:02,539 --> 00:31:03,640
- Mr. Butler.
- Yes, sir?

465
00:31:04,094 --> 00:31:05,649
Go to sleep. It's late.

466
00:31:06,727 --> 00:31:07,531
Yes, sir.

467
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:16,503
Oh, the ringing is coming from
Thod's room.

468
00:31:18,214 --> 00:31:19,073
I see.

469
00:31:19,847 --> 00:31:21,128
The ringing is from Mr. Thod's room.

470
00:31:22,901 --> 00:31:25,183
It has a lower and deeper tone.

471
00:31:27,149 --> 00:31:28,235
Thod's ringing.

472
00:31:29,985 --> 00:31:30,876
I see.

473
00:31:31,664 --> 00:31:33,594
- I can recognize it now.
- Okay.

474
00:31:34,665 --> 00:31:37,305
- Hold on.
- He won't let me go easily.

475
00:31:37,842 --> 00:31:38,631
I'll teach you.

476
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:42,167
Why?

477
00:31:42,811 --> 00:31:45,487
How can you not remember
our different ringing tone?

478
00:31:46,631 --> 00:31:49,710
- Didn't Butler Sorn teach you?
- Oh, dear.

479
00:31:53,842 --> 00:31:55,639
- Are you not going to answer?
- What should I say?

480
00:31:59,356 --> 00:32:02,660
I can't remember it.
What am I supposed to do?

481
00:32:02,767 --> 00:32:05,230
- Do you remember?
- He's getting too close.

482
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,590
You should go now.

483
00:32:08,644 --> 00:32:10,777
- So Thod won't be mad at you.
- I almost had a heart attack.

484
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:12,447
Yes, sir.

485
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:25,239
He was here and here.

486
00:32:29,856 --> 00:32:31,535
- Was that okay?
- Do it again.

487
00:32:36,142 --> 00:32:37,041
He's still not here.

488
00:32:41,408 --> 00:32:42,595
We've been calling him for awhile now.

489
00:32:48,948 --> 00:32:49,465
Wait.

490
00:32:50,746 --> 00:32:51,738
There's another rule.

491
00:32:52,331 --> 00:32:54,245
If I hear the bell at night,

492
00:32:54,636 --> 00:32:56,941
I must enter immediately.

493
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:10,384
You were very late.

494
00:33:11,652 --> 00:33:14,887
I've told you before that if you hear
the bell from Mr. Thod's room,

495
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:16,871
you must come in one minute.

496
00:33:18,807 --> 00:33:20,926
Yes, I'm sorry.

497
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:26,525
Look at how you're dressed.
I'll tell you about one more rule.

498
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:31,502
You must wear your uniform until
the lights in Mr. Thod's room are off.

499
00:33:33,658 --> 00:33:34,390
Yes.

500
00:33:37,796 --> 00:33:38,476
Mr. Thod.

501
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:40,813
Before I leave tomorrow,

502
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,203
I'll train him more.

503
00:33:45,888 --> 00:33:48,904
Up to you. I trust you, Butler Sorn.

504
00:33:50,647 --> 00:33:52,527
You both should get some rest.

505
00:33:54,459 --> 00:33:55,037
Yes, sir.

506
00:33:58,105 --> 00:33:58,505
Let's go.

507
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:17,924
Hey.

508
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,044
Please be patient.

509
00:34:20,593 --> 00:34:22,694
I'll get my naughty brother back
as soon as possible.

510
00:34:24,817 --> 00:34:25,333
Okay.

511
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:29,263
Okay. Don't forget
what I told you earlier.

512
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:30,987
Do you understand?

513
00:34:33,647 --> 00:34:35,573
- Yes.
- I'll get going.

514
00:34:45,422 --> 00:34:48,633
If that's the case, I won't have time
to steal the necklace.

515
00:34:50,407 --> 00:34:52,327
What should I do?

516
00:34:53,523 --> 00:34:55,203
Maybe...

517
00:34:56,016 --> 00:34:57,281
I might need some help.

518
00:34:58,554 --> 00:34:59,765
What am I going to do?

519
00:35:01,819 --> 00:35:02,679
Mamuang.

520
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:16,224
There are so many rules here.

521
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,473
Mr. Butler.

522
00:35:58,332 --> 00:36:00,327
Yes, Mr. Thad?

523
00:36:10,463 --> 00:36:11,237
Are you tired?

524
00:36:17,953 --> 00:36:19,625
Well... a little bit.

525
00:36:23,562 --> 00:36:25,523
You will need some time to adjust.

526
00:36:29,068 --> 00:36:29,896
Yes, sir.

527
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,447
Okay.

528
00:36:38,725 --> 00:36:39,373
Hey.

529
00:36:40,191 --> 00:36:41,074
Keep fighting,

530
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:43,667
my butler.

531
00:36:48,183 --> 00:36:49,503
That made me feel so much better.

532
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:53,688
Thank you,

533
00:36:54,766 --> 00:36:55,485
Mr. Thad.

534
00:37:17,726 --> 00:37:19,561
(Next episode)
How was your first day at work?

535
00:37:19,647 --> 00:37:23,913
He told me to take off my clothes
on the first day.

536
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:25,936
Did he really ask you to do that?

537
00:37:25,983 --> 00:37:28,302
What? Why does he hate women that much?

538
00:37:28,327 --> 00:37:29,889
How can we help you?

539
00:37:30,528 --> 00:37:33,723
The new gardener here, sir.

540
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:37,327
- Hold on, Mr. Thep.
- Butler Love.

541
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,442
What are you doing here?

542
00:37:40,669 --> 00:37:42,847
You also brought someone else here.

543
00:37:43,091 --> 00:37:45,740
Please listen to me. I can explain.

544
00:37:45,873 --> 00:37:46,693
Get out!
