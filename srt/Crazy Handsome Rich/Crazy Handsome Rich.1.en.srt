Warning.

3
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,228
This series is based
entirely on imagination and

4
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:07,480
suitable for every age
and every gender. Maybe?

5
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,680
By the way, we produce unrealistic content,

6
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,080
because we focus on
the surrealistic content

7
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,000
Good morning guys~

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,440

Thank you.

00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,200
Hello auntie, you look more
beautiful in with this lip color.

16
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,480
The handsome one is here

00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,200

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,160
2 bundles 30 baht, 3 bundles 60 baht~.

19
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,840
Enough? I'll give you one more bundle free.

20
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,600
You want it? I'll go to you.

21
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,880
Okay, wait for me.

22
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,680
I'm here~~.

23
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,320
Why are you yelling?

24
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,880
Come here, bro.

25
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,160
What is it?

26
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,160
Wow! You have a lot of vetgetables.

27
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,640
Let me see.

28
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,360
He got me.

29
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,200
Interested?

30
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,640
I'll sell it to you for cheap.

31
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,360
Huh?

32
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,600
It can make good profit.

33
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,120
You look suspicious.

34
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,280
Do you want some?

35
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,040
Can I trust him? You look like
you're hiding something from me.

36
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,320
If you want, I'll help you set it up.

37
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,200
Go ahead.

38
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,720
Hold on.

39
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,760
Mamuang! It's all papaya.

40
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,640
Yes! It's papaya.

41
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,305
I've only got papaya, don't you want it?

42
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,760
But papaya is good!

43
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,920
Mamuang.

44
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,360
Ouch!

45
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,880
You did it again.

46
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,840
You like to bring papaya to
deceive and sell to other people.

47
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,800
Im not cheating

48
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,713
This is a BIG papaya from my garden!

49
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,160
Mamuang! It's not funny.

50
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,760
The one that I brought from you
yesterday. It's still not sold out yet

51
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:12,920
Yes

52
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,028
It's good that today
someone will buy all of

53
00:05:16,052 --> 00:05:18,520
it for cooking at the
fortune teller's house.

54
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,080
All of this?

55
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,240
What do they do?

56
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,028
Well, madam bought all
of this and will make curry

57
00:05:25,052 --> 00:05:27,600
at the fortune teller's
house at Thudong Temple.

58
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,720
Fortune teller? Where?

59
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,880
Behind the market.

60
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,480
Well , I'll help you deliver vegetables.

61
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,840
Wanna buy all of this?

62
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,560
Okay.

63
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,800
And who will stay at the shop?

64
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,640
Hmm, here Mamuang , cover me.

65
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,640
Huh?

66
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,600
Keep an eye on the shop.

67
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,960
Please cover me.

68
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,640
First, let's arrange this.

69
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,160
Finish it quickly before
going to the fortune teller.

70
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,160
Come on, hurry up.

71
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,520
That's enough Mamuang.

72
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,560
Ok.

00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,520
Stay here.

77
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,000
Yes.

78
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,880
Post-purchase service.

79
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,560
Go.

80
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,320
Okay.

81
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,600
Hey Luv.

82
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:08,880
Hmm.

83
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,120
Don't forget to have
your fortune done.

84
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,720
Okay.

85
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,120
Ok let's go 1 2 3.

86
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,240
Let's go.

87
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,600
Marie the Fortune teller's house.

88
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,920
I'm tired , carring these
vegetables all the way here.

89
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,680
Where are you going?

90
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,120
Delivering vegetables.

91
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,280
That Fortune teller is very accurate.

92
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,160
Are they?

93
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,960
Hurry up and go to see the fortune teller.

94
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,920
Oh, if this is accurate, I will win the lottery for sure.

95
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,240
Your body is so big, why bother me carring this here?

96
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,600
Hurry up.

97
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,920
Where is it?

98
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,760
Just follow me.

99
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,440
You don't have to know.

100
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,840
Oh, Marie the fortune teller.

101
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,640
I want to hear my horoscope so bad.

102
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,480
Why did you stop?

103
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,320
Go this way, right?

104
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,000
No! This way.

105
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,720
Oh, I think this way.

106
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,720
Go now.

107
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,680
We are running out of time

108
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,160
Hurry up.

109
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,360
Why don't you help me?

110
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,200
Are you okay?

111
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,080
Okay.

112
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,480
Go go.

113
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:13,433
It's not freaking OK.

114
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,560
It's too late, we won't be on time.

115
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,080
I want to know about my soulmate,
but my boyfriend ....

116
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,680
Oh, I don't have a boyfriend.

117
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,640
Wipe, wipe , wipe

118
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,080
Very good.

119
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,320
Wandering around the market for a
while but I haven't seen any egg shops yet.

120
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,440
Hey, do you know where the egg shop is?

121
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm here.

122
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,960
Don't spray my face

123
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,760
Check this out.

124
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,880
This is so awesome.

125
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,040
Are we going to see the horoscope now?

126
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,200
Hey Mamuang.

127
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,520
What?

128
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,040
Why did you shut my mouth?

129
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,560
Don't tell me you're going
to see your horoscope again.

130
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,000
How did you know that?

131
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:58,760
I'm not.

132
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,360
Yes.

133
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,200
Who will go to see the horoscope? No one.

134
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Aren't you going?

135
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,440
Hey Mamuang.

136
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,960
But I want to see my horoscope.

137
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,680
What is wrong with you?

138
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,880
Why im so sleepy?

139
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,000
It's suspicious.

140
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,680
Mamuang, cover me.

141
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,480
I will go to bed now.

142
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,120
So sleepy.

143
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,520
Who will cover your shop?

144
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,280
Who?

145
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:23,800
It's me again?

146
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,920
Will anyone follow me?

147
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,400
The house is in front of me.

148
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,400
I have to go

149
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,600
What should I do?

150
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,600
Really, Uncle Wan is handsome.

151
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,520
But Uncle Wan.

152
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,560
Handsomeness can't compete with me.

153
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,040
I wear a handsome suit, a
cool suit like James Bond, right?

154
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,040
Right?

155
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,520
No.

156
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,360
Hey Luv.

157
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,640
Oops!

158
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,280
What are you doing here?

159
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,560
And what are you doing here?

160
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,760
He got you

161
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,480
Hello Mr. Butler.

162
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,400
Hello.

163
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,840
Aren't you at the market?

164
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,000
I just came to deliver vegetables.

165
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,640
Business seems going well.

166
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,480
Your uncle must earn a lot of money.

167
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,920
Amen.

168
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,080
It's good to get rich once in a while.

169
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,720
By the way, what are you doing here?

170
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,600
Uncle. I have to go now.

171
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,520
Okay, see you.

172
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,680
See you. Uncle Wan.

173
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,240
Good luck.

174
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,680
What should I tell him?

175
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,640
I...

176
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,840
So what are you doing here?

177
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,400
Don't you need to go back home?

178
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,280
I will

179
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,080
Let's go!

180
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,880
Yes!

181
00:09:58,806 --> 00:09:59,886
What should I do?

182
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,200
He's gone.

183
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,560
Should I go to see fortune teller?

184
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,120
Luv!

185
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,160
Go home!

186
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,080
I will.

187
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,280
Who are you waiting for?

188
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,960
What should I do?

189
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,320
Is he gone?

190
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,520
Is he gone?

191
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,440
If he's gone, I'll go to
meet the fortune teller.

192
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:22,240
Alright, I'll go!!

193
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,000
The weather is very hot.
I have been here since the morning.

194
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,720
Hey, is this rumor really true?

195
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,360
Very accurate.

196
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,080
What happened?

197
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,320
Nooooooo.

198
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:32,920
She left?

199
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,080
What's going on inside?

200
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,040
Is there a ghost?

201
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,760
She ran like she saw a ghost.

202
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,520
Why are there so many people?

203
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,480
It's a long queue.

204
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,480
The office is closed!!!

205
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,800
Listen!

206
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,160
I already took the day off.

207
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,480
The fortune teller is tired today.

208
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,320
We must save the power of
the fortune-teller for the next day.

209
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,080
Just go back.

210
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,760
Go back.

211
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,320
Go back now I'm will close the office.

212
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,480
Come back again.

213
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,400
Chase us away

214
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,520
Come in.

215
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,200
Hey, who called me?

216
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,000
It's you. Come on.

217
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,200
Me?

218
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,240
It's you.

219
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,200
Oh me.

220
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,600
Okay okay.

221
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,000
Can I go in?

222
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,200
Welcome.

223
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,720
Playing hard to get.

224
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,960
Get in, the fortune
teller is waiting for you.

225
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,440
Okay.

226
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,240
So wide.

227
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,720
She set the candle, it's so beautiful.

228
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,760
Who is this?

229
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,040
Sit down.

230
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,160
This is so big

231
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,560
Huh? Me?

232
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,880
I'm talking to you.

233
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,320
Huh?

234
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,680
Will the table break?

235
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,240
Ommmm.

236
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,040
Uh fortune teller.

237
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,640
Don't say anything.

238
00:12:12,768 --> 00:12:14,440
Abracadabra.

239
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,560
Abracadabra.

240
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,160
Abracadabra.

241
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,615
Gold face.

242
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,360
Beautiful face.

243
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,120
Mommy, please come here.

244
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,960
You will meet your soulmate.

245
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,680
Really?

246
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,760
Yes.

247
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,360
And how do you know?

248
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,680
I know, I see everything.

249
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,520
This!

250
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,360
How do you know?

251
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,320
Really?

252
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,360
Abracadabra.

253
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,360
Abracadabra.

254
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,440
Your soulmate,

255
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,120
is a handsome young man.

256
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,280
And lives in a place
that is big and luxurious.

257
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,255
Can you conjure stuff too?

258
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,040
No.

259
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,880
This is a necklace.

260
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,520
That will lead you to meet your soulmate.

261
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,560
Will you give it to me?

262
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,280
And your destiny after this.

263
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,800
Will change.

264
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,920
Be prepared to handle it well.

265
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,720
Oh..

266
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,200
Take it.

267
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,480
Finally you gave it to me.

268
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,040
What do you mean?

269
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,160
What?

270
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,240
Go back now.

271
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,840
The fortune teller will meditate.

272
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,200
Uh..

273
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,800
I don't have to pay?

274
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,000
No.

275
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:11,040
Prepare a good-sized papaya or
eggplant once your wish has granted.

276
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,160
Come and give it to me. That's enough.

277
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,400
Is that an eggplant or something?

278
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,880
You can go back now.

279
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,960
We are closing.

280
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,440
Okay, I'm leaving, goodbye.

281
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,360
Real eggplants?

282
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,400
Papaya or what?

283
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,360
Huh, I'm peeking at you.

284
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,000
My Amulet.

285
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,360
Sigh, keep meditating.

286
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,520
(Next Break)
Brother.

287
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,760
I don't want to be a butler.

288
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,000
Stop.

289
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,320
Don't let the master hear that again.

290
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,320
Calm down, please.

291
00:14:49,373 --> 00:14:51,053
I can't calm down anymore!

292
00:15:04,997 --> 00:15:08,840
This is a necklace that will
lead you to meet your soulmate.

293
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,320
And your destiny after this.

294
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,640
Will change.

295
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,440
Be prepared to handle it well.

296
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,680
Luv.

297
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,400
Hmm what's wrong?

298
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,480
Father asked me to call you to eat.

299
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,160
Okay, I'll go

300
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,360
Did you go to see your horoscope?

301
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,800
Hmm...

302
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,560
No.

303
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,160
Don't stare at me.

304
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,800
Lie.

305
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:47,840
Hmm.

306
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,760
We grew up together like this.

307
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,360
Why wouldn't I know?

308
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,040
Did you know that?

309
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,560
When you lie.

310
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,360
Your nose will look like this.

311
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,080
I got caught.

312
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,040
Yes, I went to go get my horoscope read.

313
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,680
Well, I really don't understand you.

314
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,720
Why are you so ignorant?

315
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,200
Fortune tellers, all they do is guess.

316
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,240
Why do you believe them?

317
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,480
Inn, I'm sorry.

318
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,560
This time will be the last time.

319
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,960
Did you go get your horoscope read?

320
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,880
Uncle Wan.

321
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,600
How is it?

322
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,560
Accurate?

323
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,720
Dad!

324
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,800
What?

325
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,680
Dad!

326
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,760
What is wrong with you?

327
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,920
You don't believe it's your business,

328
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,200
but I believe in it.

329
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,840
I think I'm going to see
the fortune-teller as well.

330
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,920
Hmm.

331
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,520
Both stopped.

332
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,080
Go.

333
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,520
What.

334
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,080
Let's eat.

335
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,440
Eat!

336
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,800
You guys are talking only
about horoscopes.

337
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,920
Go watch boxing.

338
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,480
Is it the time for watching boxing?

339
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
At a fresh market.

340
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,600
Aren't you going to open the
vegetable shop, brother Wan?

341
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,200
I'm bored,
I'm already rich.

342
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,280
So just pay after you're done eating.

343
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:07,640
Dad.

344
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,200
I'm kidding

345
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,200
I will open, I'll drink coffee first.

346
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,360
Well, today, I'll leave you
to open the shop for me.

347
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,720
I'm going to drop off
stuff with my dad in town.

348
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,040
So when are you coming back?

349
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,680
Probably late at night.

350
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,360
Hmm.

351
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,080
Oh, it's so fun.

352
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,800
Splattered blood.

353
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,240
What are you reading?

354
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,520
Oops, the customer is here.

355
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,960
Hello, butler.

356
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,400
What would you like today?

357
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,880
Out of papaya?

358
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,160
Someone already bought it all.

359
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,160
Do you want it?

360
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,160
No.

361
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,040
Just asking.

362
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,480
So, what did you get today?

363
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,640
Oh, take all of these?

364
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,040
Yes.

365
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,040
All of these.

366
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,000
You can speak?

367
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,120
Someone with a little "thing" bullying me.

368
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,960
You've waited for me for a while.

369
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,680
I'll prepare it for you.

370
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,840
This.

371
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,640
Here you are.

372
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,560
Next is cabbage.

373
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,160
I take this one.

374
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,240
Okay.

375
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,000
Cabbage has four legs.

376
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Hey, there's not a
cabbage that has four legs.

377
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,040
How does the song go?

378
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,880
Cabbage Cabbage.

379
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,120
Well, I know.

380
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,880
Where are you going?

381
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,520
I'm not going anywhere.

382
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,560
Don't lie.

383
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,280
Didn't I tell you? When working,
don't use your phone.

384
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,280
Sigh, I'm not lying.

385
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,320
And I didn't even use
my cell phone at home.

386
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,800
Tomorrow, I'm going to take
you to be the family butler.

387
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,080
So what?

388
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,600
Let's go back and talk about this at home.

389
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,080
Here you are.

390
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,720
Brother.

391
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,200
I don't want to be a butler.

392
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,440
What do you mean?

393
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,240
I mean what I say.

394
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,360
I want to be myself.

395
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,880
Stop forcing me.

396
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,240
Oops, I'm totally shocked.

397
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,160
Tomorrow, I'm going to take
you to be the family's butler.

398
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,240
No.

399
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,200
I don't go.

400
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,160
Where are you going?

401
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,240
I'm going to travel.

402
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,840
Mister's family.

403
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,800
They are very grateful to us.

404
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,640
And one more thing.

405
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,840
Taking care of the three misters, it must
be inherited from generation to generation.

406
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,680
Do you understand?

407
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,680
A servant. Is it duty?

408
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,920
Stop.

409
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,200
Don't let Mister hear that word

410
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,360
No, I won't do it.

411
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,040
You have to.

412
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,680
I don't.

413
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,560
Hey butler.

414
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,160
Let's calm down first.

415
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,920
People in the market are all shocked.

416
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,440
Sorry.

417
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,080
Never mind.

418
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,920
Here you are.

419
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,640
What are you doing?

420
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,960
I will do whatever is up to me.

421
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,040
You can't force me.

422
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,840
Stop.

423
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,120
Calm down, please.

424
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,360
I cant calm down anymore!!

425
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,000
If you want to, then go alone.

426
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,880
Oops, the vegetables must be hurt.

427
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,560
Did you take it?

428
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,120
Have you paid yet?

429
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,800
No.

430
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,600
Pay now.

431
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,200
Is Uncle Wan at home?

432
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,240
Well, I have some errands that I
want to talk to you about.

433
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,640
Uncle Wan is not here.

434
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,480
But if you have anything.

435
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:56,665
you can wait at home.

436
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,880
Thank you

437
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,880
I am stressed.

438
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,920
Butler.

439
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,800
Are you okay?

440
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,960
So what are you going to do about this?

441
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,480
I still can't figure it out.

442
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,120
Tomorrow will have to send the butler.

443
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,880
Hmm who?

444
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,440
Oh wow, butler of a big
family at the end of the market.

445
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,160
Is that right? Hello.

446
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,520
Mamuang.

447
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,640
He is stressed.

448
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,360
What's stressful?

449
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,720
It's the butler's brother.

450
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,520
He has run away.

451
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,600
Run away?!

452
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,200
Yes.

453
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:53,840
Where did he run off to?

454
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,440
If I knew where he fled to,
I probably would have told you.

455
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,160
That's right.

456
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,520
And tomorrow.

457
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,360
Must also be the day of
sending the new butler.

458
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,800
Oh, that's too bad.

459
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,520
Why would you be stressed?

460
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,600
You can just find a new butler to go in.

461
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,240
Are you crazy, Mamuang?

462
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,960
How could you do that?

463
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,280
Come on.

464
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,640
All right.

465
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,200
Where are you going?

466
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,560
Going back to selling vegetables.

467
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,280
Nooo.

468
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,640
Help me please.

469
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,040
I can't be a butler.

470
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,440
We have known each other for a long time.

471
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,600
I know.

472
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,560
That we have known
each other for a long time.

473
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,240
But me and you.

474
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,560
I've only known you as a customer.

475
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,000
Come on, you'll have a better life.

476
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,280
So our Inn and Uncle Wan?

477
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,080
Don't worry about that.

478
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,400
He must have a way of explaining it.

479
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,160
If you want something,

480
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,080
I'll totally help.

481
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,560
I want a soulmate.

482
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,840
Come on, you don't have to
worry about the vegetable shop.

483
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,360
I will help you keep an eye on it.

484
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,600
I don't charge.

485
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,240
I'm rich, let me tell you.

486
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,040
I'm not bragging.

487
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,280
Come on.

488
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,240
I propose to you.

489
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,560
Five hundred thousand.

490
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,440
What?!

491
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,240
Five hundred thousand!

492
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,200
I'm poor.

493
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
Mamuang. Calm Down.

494
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,640
Intercept me.

495
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,240
I think it's too much.

496
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,960
No.

497
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,960
It's compensation for your family and you.

498
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,200
Are you going to do it? Are you?
It's a lot of pressure.

499
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,400
Okay.

500
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,200
Because we've known
each other for a long time.

501
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,440
Not because of the money.

502
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,760
Thank you.

503
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,800
Don't tell him.

504
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,120
It's actually because of the money.

505
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,560
But

506
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,320
I can't do anything.

507
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,640
Besides selling vegetables.

508
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,880
About that.

509
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,960
Not a problem

510
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,920
I'll handle it myself.

511
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,880
Oops, I think there's a problem.

512
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,200
I'm leaving too. I've got to go.

513
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,200
Then leave the mango.

514
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,640
What are you talking about?

515
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,080
It's suspicious.

516
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,840
Millions of floating stars.

517
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,000
Enough.

518
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:12,840
Huh?

519
00:25:15,726 --> 00:25:17,366
Growing up together like this.

520
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,680
Why wouldn't I know?

521
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,400
That this joke is useless.

522
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,640
Well, are you angry with me?

523
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,320
No.

524
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,520
I respect your decision.

525
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,840
Thank you.

526
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,560
I'm sorry.

527
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,640
That I'm an extra member to your family.

528
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,080
If my father didn't...

529
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,600
Don't think too much.

530
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,920
We grew up together like this.

531
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,720
Even though you are not
my father's biological child...

532
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,360
I love you like a real brother.

533
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,600
So I can be your real brother, right?

534
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,600
Is it just your brother?

535
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,080
What?

536
00:26:33,963 --> 00:26:35,103
What other kind is there?

537
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,840
Huh?

538
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,640
I'm kidding.

539
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,440
Inn, a shooting star!

540
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,120
What are you doing?

541
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,440
Praying.

542
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,160
Praying?

543
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,320
Stopped being angry at me yet?

544
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,240
I'm not angry.

545
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,840
Really?

546
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,960
Yes.

547
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,480
When you go there,

548
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,160
Take care of yourself.

549
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,520
I am worried about you.

550
00:27:45,947 --> 00:27:48,907
Okay, you too.

551
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,840
Okay.

552
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,520
(Next Break)
Are you good at Muay Thai?

553
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,160
Yes.

554
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,960
Whether it's punching.

555
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,280
And elbowing.

556
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,560
Kneeing.

557
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,520
And 360 head shot kick knockouts.

558
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,800
I'm very good at Muay Thai.

559
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,720
I'm sorry.

560
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,760
When I look in the mirror, I'm pretty fit.

561
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,960
I'm so handsome.

562
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,600
This position is good.

563
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,120
God definitely gave it to me.

564
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,120
A slender person like
me will become a butler.

565
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,560
Soulmate necklace.

566
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,160
Is it true?

567
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,680
I don't know, just wear it first.

568
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,573
When will you come?

569
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,320
Wow, so handsome, so cool, my friend.

570
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,880
Really? But..

571
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,680
A bit uncomfortable.

572
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
It's okay.

573
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,040
Don't think too much.

574
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,880
Anyway good luck.

575
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,120
Okay.

576
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,600
Uncle Wan, come quickly.

577
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,680
Oh my god.

578
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,880
It's late.

579
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,880
Inn, go.

580
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,840
See you Uncle Wan.

581
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,680
See you.

582
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,280
So

583
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,960
I'll go now.

584
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:40,960
Okay.

585
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,200
Anyway, take care of yourself.

586
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,600
If there is anything, call me.

587
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,000
Mister's house is just
at the end of the market.

588
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,280
If you miss him, you can go to meet him?

589
00:30:59,102 --> 00:31:00,040
Go.

590
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,600
Okay Dad.

591
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,720
I'll go now.

592
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,200
Let me see.

593
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,800
Beautiful necktie.

594
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,200
Fighting.

595
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:17,520
Oh.

596
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,440
Hello butler.

597
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:18,840
Hello.

598
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,840
Hello.

599
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,840
You look better in this uniform.

600
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,040
Let's go.

601
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,400
It's time.

602
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,320
Okay.

603
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,000
Hey butler.

604
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,560
Talking like taking him to the dorm.

605
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,600
Wait.

606
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,600
Take this.

607
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,760
Okay thank you.

608
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,200

609
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,200
And mango.

610
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,360
Hey, my muscles are growing. Mamuang

611
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,160
let's go.

612
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,160
Let's go.

613
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,480
Give me a hug.

614
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,400
Come visit me often.

615
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,360
Of course.

616
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,240
All right, let's go now.

617
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:09,760
Go.

618
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,320
Okay.

619
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,040
Bye.

620
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,160
Bye bye.

621
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,840
See you soon. Bye.

622
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,440
I will call you later.

623
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,520
Okay.

624
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,000
Oh my god!

625
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,600
Really rich.

626
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,880
Butler.

627
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,280
Hmm?

628
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,360
Can I do it?

629
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,000
Yes, you can do it

630
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,760
I'll handle it.

631
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,600
Done.

632
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,160
Hello

633
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,400
I'm butler Luv.

634
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,320
No!

635
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,440
Butler Sin.

636
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,160
Oh, Sin!

637
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,760
Yes, I'm Sin.

638
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,760
I'm butler Sin.

639
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,760
Sin.

640
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,920
I completely forgot that
I had to be called Sin.

641
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,000
I really have to be called Sin.

642
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,560
Omg, so handsome.

643
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,920
From head to toe.

644
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,680
Looks good.

645
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,280
Oh.

646
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,520
This is Sin.

647
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,160
He will be the new butler.

648
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,760
Of your family.

649
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,400
I will take care of him in the first month.

650
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,240
And after that he will take the position.

651
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,680
To replace me.

652
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,440
Is your name Sin?

653
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,480
Yes.

654
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,360
By the way,

655
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,000
Are you good at Muay Thai?

656
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,640
Oh yes.

657
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,920
Whether it's punching.

658
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,280
And elbowing.

659
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,000
Kneeing.

660
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,880
And 360 head shot kick knockouts.

661
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,720
I'm very good at Muay Thai.

662
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,040
Enough.

663
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,160
I'm sorry.

664
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,360
Sorry.

665
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,400
Is this the butler's brother?

666
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,560
Yes.

667
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,040
What about leisure activities?

668
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,163
What do you like to do?

669
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,920
In the morning while
waiting for Brother Sorn.

670
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,520
Oh

671
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,160
While waiting for butler
Sorn to pick me up,

672
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,400
I took a banana tree and
carved it into a toy car.

673
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,960
Wow! You are so good.

674
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,320
Good! I like it.

675
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,320
Yes.

676
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,600
Do you know?

677
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,560
That the rules of this place stipulate
that women cannot come inside.

678
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,160
Yes, do you know?

679
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,080
But I have that...

680
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,680
I know.

681
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,600
I'm a man.

682
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,920
How can I be sure?

683
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,520
That you are not in disguise.

684
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,520
Oh Mister, have you
watched a lot of dramas?

685
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,080
It's really suspicious.

686
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,680
Anyway.

687
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,840
Your face doesn't look
like your brother Sorn at all.

688
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,320
How can it be like that?

689
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,600
I can't tell.

690
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,280
I don't know, what should I do?

691
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,480
Looks suspicious.

692
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,080
It made me think.

693
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,040
What should I do, Mr.Thot?

694
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,600
So...

695
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,560
Take off your clothes.

696
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,520
Huh?

697
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,520
Yes.

698
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,920
Do I have to undress?

699
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,040
It would be too much.

700
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,200
Undress now

701
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,320
I will see.

702
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,000
Why didn't you tell me?

703
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,440
I have to do that?

704
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,680
Sorn butler.

705
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,120
You know the rules of this house.

706
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,120
Didn't you tell the new butler?

707
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,160
Yes.

708
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,840
You still have to undress.

709
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,080
The butler is so mean.

710
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,560
Suddenly making me me undress.

711
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,560
They're all so mean.

712
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,560
Or you won't dare.

713
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,360
You really don't dare.

714
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,560
Is he going to do it?

715
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,200
Okay.

716
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,000
I will do it

717
00:38:36,926 --> 00:38:38,433
My secret weapon

718
00:38:39,731 --> 00:38:41,668
is this necklace.

719
00:38:41,827 --> 00:38:43,894
Mister

720
00:38:44,061 --> 00:38:45,553
May I store this?

721
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:46,256
Deal.

722
00:38:46,878 --> 00:38:48,166
Can you bring me water?

723
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,240
Please don't serve in a cup.

724
00:38:50,659 --> 00:38:52,205
I love to drink from the mouth ....

725
00:38:52,237 --> 00:38:53,065
of a bottle.

726
00:38:53,096 --> 00:38:53,854
What are you doing?

727
00:38:54,753 --> 00:38:56,433
I'm here to clean up.

728
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:57,830
Wait.

729
00:38:58,964 --> 00:39:00,324
Another rule for the butler in this house,

730
00:39:00,892 --> 00:39:03,148
you must wear a butler uniform

731
00:39:03,228 --> 00:39:05,133
untill Mister turns off the light.

732
00:42:10,373 --> 00:42:12,173
Turn to the left just a bit.

733
00:42:23,568 --> 00:42:24,928
(speaking Korean)

734
00:42:25,818 --> 00:42:27,224
Are you a butler?

735
00:42:27,264 --> 00:42:28,264
Yes sir.

736
00:42:28,506 --> 00:42:30,013
Butler has to be this handsome?

737
00:42:30,126 --> 00:42:30,883
Yes sir.

738
00:42:32,368 --> 00:42:34,493
They ask
me to imagine what im going to say.

739
00:42:34,563 --> 00:42:36,363
It's called an emotional scene,

740
00:42:36,579 --> 00:42:38,579
I need to prepare for a while for it,

741
00:42:39,923 --> 00:42:40,923
I need to build up emotions.

742
00:42:41,962 --> 00:42:43,642
This gives me a headache.

743
00:42:55,235 --> 00:42:56,915
Is this the temple kid gang?

744
00:42:57,142 --> 00:42:58,822
Or is it the market kid gang?

745
00:42:58,996 --> 00:43:02,388
(singing YOUNGOHM - THATTHONG SOUND badly)

746
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:06,349
Stop!! Tha's agianst copyright.

747
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:10,628
Hello

748
00:43:10,699 --> 00:43:13,835
I'm jiiosafiposdufsud98fys9dfuis
(alien language)

749
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:17,293
How was it?

750
00:43:36,784 --> 00:43:38,448
I'm like an Americano,

751
00:43:38,503 --> 00:43:40,183
I make your heart beat without milk.

752
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:42,050
What the hell?

753
00:43:42,738 --> 00:43:44,424
Coffee tastes bitter
so you can try me cause I taste better.

754
00:43:48,507 --> 00:43:50,187
What is happening to him?

755
00:43:52,211 --> 00:43:53,944
How many scenes do we have left?

756
00:43:54,328 --> 00:43:56,194
There are 3 more scenes left.

757
00:43:56,625 --> 00:43:57,825
Look at my face

758
00:43:58,484 --> 00:44:01,384
I look like a fool
and I act like a brat,

759
00:44:01,445 --> 00:44:03,125
