(Crazy Handsome Rich)
(Episode 3)

2
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,760
(Previously) You've got to
know that while you stay here,

3
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,840
You must strictly follow the rules of this house.

4
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,320
Copy that, Mr. Thod.

5
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,640
Don't use mobile phones.

6
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,160
In this house.

7
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,280
Hot!!

8
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,560
I'm so sorry Mr. Thod.

9
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,200
The bell is ringing again??

10
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,920
The bell is ringing again??

11
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,720
You take too long.

12
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,440
I'm sorry.

13
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:35,720
Butler

14
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:38,760
Yes?

15
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,480
Keep fighting.

16
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,000
My butler.

17
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,640
Do you really wanna go, butler Sorn?

18
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,160
Yes, I've got something to do.

19
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,400
I mean...

20
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,600
Oh! Did you go to work in that house?

21
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,400
Yes

22
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,720
That's good!
Come on, let's go over there.

23
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,320
Good luck!

24
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,560
Thanks, bye.

25
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,600
See you later.

26
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,760
We've got to cooking for
misters after shopping.

27
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:21,880
Okay

28
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,760
Let me see.

29
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,840
A lot!

30
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,840
Are you sure?

31
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,960
Yes, you talk to him first.

32
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,400
We still have time.

33
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,080
I'll be waiting you at
the back of market.

34
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,280
How was your first day?

35
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Oh~ On my first day,

36
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,080
They made take off all my clothes.

37
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:51,960
WHAT?!

38
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,880
Did they do it that much?

39
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,520
Take off your clothes?

40
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,440
Inn, calm down.

41
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,520
I'm fine.

42
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,960
Fine?

43
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,200
But I'm not!

44
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,960
Go and quit right now!

45
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,640
No, I can't.

46
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,760
Why not?

47
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,280
I can't do that.

48
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,640
And...

49
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,720
Tomorrow, Butler Sorn
will not be that house either.

50
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,400
Who will take care of them?

51
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,960
Them?

52
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,520
They're already grown enough.

53
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,960
They can't take care themselves?

54
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,200
By the way, you've to quit.

55
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,200
Inn, please~~

56
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,440
No!

57
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,520
Inn

58
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,880
No

59
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,080
If you see us as a
family, you've got to quit.

60
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,400
Or you have another reason?

61
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Hey! My friend!

62
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
On the first day of work,
you already miss me?

63
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,520
Come to visit me, right?

64
00:06:09,545 --> 00:06:10,625
Nah, I came to buy vegetables.

65
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,720
Ah!

66
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,840
Buy papaya?

67
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,200
Do you?

68
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,080
A new papaya is coming out.

69
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
What? We're serious.

70
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,280
Hello guys!

71
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,160
Huh?

72
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,080
What's wrong with him?

73
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,640
They can't recognize me.

74
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,160
Hey!

75
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,960
Hey what?

76
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,400
Butler Sin?

77
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,200
Sh*t!

78
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,640
Butler Sin! Wait for me!

79
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,880
There's no butler here!

80
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,040
What?!

81
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,760
Butler?

82
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,640
What the heck??

83
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,280
Butler Sin is so fast!

84
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,880
- I'm not a butler! I'm P'Add (singer)
- Wait for me!

85
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,880
Butler Sin, wait!

86
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,960
Where are you going?

87
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,760
Butler Sin, wait!

88
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,600
Where is he?

89
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,640
He's so fast.

90
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,840
I've got to go back again.

91
00:07:09,581 --> 00:07:10,600
Come on!

92
00:07:13,247 --> 00:07:14,047
He's really fast.

93
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,200
Hey!

94
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,200
Who did you call?

95
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,440
He's the brother of Butler Sorn.

96
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,520
He is a butler too.

97
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,320
Huh?
What?

98
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,960
I mean

99
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,760
He's the brother of butler who
came to buy our vegetables.

100
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,400
Where has he gone?

101
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,080
I've got no idea.

102
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,960
What are you talking about?

103
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,760
I...

104
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,760
Vegetables!

105
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,760
You want papayas, right?

106
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,200
You sell papayas again.

107
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,040
That I told you, it's so big like this!

108
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,760
Do you want more?

109
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,080
You look like mango.

110
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,280
I'll take it all.

111
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,960
Do you got that, Inn?

112
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,400
Here you are.

113
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,520
I'm waiting for such
long time. I'm bored now.

114
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,640
Oh there!

115
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,840
Butler!!

116
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,640
Hi guys.
Yep

117
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,880
I'm here.

118
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,160
Cool. Yes, sir.

119
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,200
Is it alright?

120
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,080
Here you are.

121
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,760
Okay

122
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,280
Come on, Inn.

123
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,120
Is there someting wrong?

124
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,520
Nah

125
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,360
Nothing

126
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,400
Just go

127
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:34,920
Go

128
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:35,920
Go

129
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,280
Hurry up

130
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,480
Can he survive?

131
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,400
I forgot that,

132
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,040
The book that I gave
you, did you read it all?

133
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,760
They treat you like that there?

134
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,000
Yes

135
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,040
What?! Why do they hate women so much?

136
00:09:08,993 --> 00:09:10,153
I've got no idea too.

137
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,040
By the way, you've got to quit.

138
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,400
I'm not okay with that.

139
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,360
Wait! Quit your job?

140
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:19,880
Calm down mate.

141
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,640
I think it's a lot of fun there.

142
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,400
I want to know too.

143
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,280
Why don't they allow women inside?

144
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,040
But it's not our business.

145
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,640
Huh?

146
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,640
Just don't mess with it.

147
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,920
Now you can go, he's waiting for you.

148
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,160
You think I'm involved with him?

149
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,280
Yes

150
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,760
What?!

151
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,520
Okay you go.

152
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,760
Hey! Luv!

153
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,280
Huh?

154
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,280
Don't you want to know?

155
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,040
Know what?

156
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,680
Who is your soulmate.

157
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,160
Yes, I want to know.

158
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,040
But the three of them...

159
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,040
Also have the same lock-shaped necklace.

160
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,640
I knew it!

161
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,160
How?

162
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,400
I'm so smart!

163
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,400
Because I ate papaya since I was young.

164
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,160
It might not be...

165
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,040
I think if you want to know,

166
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,560
Who is your soulmate.

167
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,000
You have to do this,

168
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,680
Steal!

169
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,360
Steal??

170
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,560
Yes, steal it.

171
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,680
Lower your voice.

172
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,520
Ah~ I think so.

173
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,560
But you have find some ways,

174
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,160
To let Inn get inside
to work in that house.

175
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,400
Will he agree to that?

176
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,680
Of course!

177
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,680
I'll talk to him, trust me.

178
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,880
You should go now.

179
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,160
Luv!

180
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,760
Yes

181
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,920
I asked if you read all
of the book I gave you.

182
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,160
I read it all already.

183
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,000
Then, Let's go.

184
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,240
I thought all the time.

185
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,000
Ouch!
Oh!

186
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm so sorry.

187
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,480
What's happen to you?

188
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,400
You have to concentrate more.

189
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,480
It's not easy

190
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,680
To work in this house.

191
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,880
Okay

192
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,120
Butler Sorn

193
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,920
Do you really have to go?

194
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,280
Yes, I do.

195
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,240
I entrust mister's house to you

196
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,640
For a little while.

197
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,760
I have to go on some important business.

198
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,880
What??

199
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,280
Don't be sad, keep fighting!

200
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,040
He looks so sad.

201
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,760
Please sit down here sir.

202
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,680
Okay

203
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,280
Thanks

204
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,880
You eat first.

205
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,920
Hm? Me?

206
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,760
How can I survive?

207
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,760
I'll let you go first.

208
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,160
Can I eat?

209
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,680
He gets Omelette with Acacia first.

210
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,880
And then...

211
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,880
We need to keep waiting,

212
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,160
Whether it's delicious or not.

213
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,880
Alright, what's your opinion?

214
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,040
Is it delicious?

215
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,680
Okay, You'll go first.

216
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,640
Is he gonna be alright?

217
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,280
I knew that!

218
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,160
Water, sir.

219
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,000
You cough so loud.

220
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,400
What do you think?

221
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,640
Not bad.

222
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,120
What?!

223
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,880
I can forgive him 90 percent.

224
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,760
90 percent?

225
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,760
Thank you, Mr. Thod.

226
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,640
Wow!!

227
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,040
That mean we can't die, right?

228
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,640
Can we eat it?

229
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,800
Mister

230
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,680
What?

231
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,800
After this meal,

232
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,800
May I be excused?

233
00:13:24,647 --> 00:13:26,487
You need to come back quickly.

234
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,000
Will he miss me?

235
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:28,425
I got that.

236
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,880
So when will you come back?

237
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,400
Let's say that when the time is right.

238
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,360
He will come back then.

239
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,240
While he isn't home,
let butler Sin do his work first.

240
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,000
Can he handle it all?

241
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,480
P'Thod, you know that he just came,

242
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,640
He can't do these things much.

243
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,640
That's right.

244
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,520
Can you take care of us?

245
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I agree with P'Thad.

246
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,040
Or...

247
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,640
What?

248
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,800
Shall we find more butlers?

249
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,280
No!

250
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,120
It's just my opinion.

251
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,120
No one can replace butler Sorn.

252
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,120
Butler of our family,

253
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,040
That should come from
the old butler family only!

254
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,160
So boring.

255
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,040
Okay~~

256
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,240
You can taste this,

257
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,360
it's good.

258
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,360
Really?

259
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,760
Can we eat it?

260
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,880
Oops!

261
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,240
He's shy to me.

262
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,000
Eat slowly.

263
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,560
So delicious

264
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,120
So delicious~

265
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,760
Butler Sorn

266
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,480
Thanks so much.

267
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,240
See you later.

268
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,880
Bye

269
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,680
Bon voyage.

270
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,880
Those are the lock-shaped
necklaces of misters.

271
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,480
What should I do?

272
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,760
Please take care of it from now.

273
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,760
Butler

274
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:43,400
Butler Sin

275
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,160
Yes?

276
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,640
Just manage by yourself.

277
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,160
Give us the burden.

278
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,800
It's good for you?

279
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,560
Finally

280
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,680
Butler Sin

281
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,760
I've something to talk to you.

282
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,520
Can you help me...

283
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,280
Hmmm?

284
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,880
Nothing, P'Thad.

285
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,560
I'll go inside first.

286
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,880
Please don't look at me so long,
I rarely have immunity.

287
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,800
Tell me if you feel hungry,
I'll set my cap for you.

288
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,680
Smile like this, you may want to be my baby

289
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,920
I don't flirt with you that much,
you already fell in love with me.

290
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,040
Rule number 52,
Don't bring outsiders into this house,

291
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,560
Without permission from misters.

292
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,400
Rule number 53...

293
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:52,880
Huh?

294
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,400
If do not bring outsiders into this house,

295
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
How can bring Inn and
Mamuang into this house?

296
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,720
Mr. Thad

297
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,800
He looks so handsome today.

298
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,040
What is he doing here?

299
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,040
Let's peek a bit.

300
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,760
He's still handsome like every day.

301
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,800
Mr. Thad,

302
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,600
look like he likes exercising a lot.

303
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,520
That's a lock-shaped necklace!

304
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,760
Steal?

305
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,680
No!

306
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,920
I've got to find the way to
bring Inn into this house.

307
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,440
What should I do?

308
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:55,960
Let's think about it.

309
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,800
Practice to be ready to
fight with Bento. No! Kota

310
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,920
What's happened to me?

311
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,960
Butler!

312
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,760
Mister

313
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,040
When have you been here?

314
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,200
I don't know that.

315
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,480
So what did you do up there?

316
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,120
Ah! I climbed up to cut
branches, it was too long.

317
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,040
Ah! Butler Sorn is not here, isn’t it?

318
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,800
Yes… Mister, Make way for me, please

319
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,520
It can fall down and hit you.

320
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,280
Then you climbed to cut
that while I was boxing?

321
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,200
So, Do you need a hand?

322
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,120
That’s fine

323
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,040
This job is…

324
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,960
Heyyyyy

325
00:19:14,772 --> 00:19:16,772
(Next Break)
Your padlock necklace.

326
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
It looks like my key chain.

327
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,040
Can I try to unlock it?

328
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,159
Mister

329
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,080
When have you been here?

330
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,400
I don't know that.

331
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:46,240
So...

332
00:19:46,639 --> 00:19:47,920
what did you do up there?

333
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,440
Ah! I climbed up to cut
branches, it was too long.

334
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,040
Then you climbed to cut
that while I was boxing?

335
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,680
Ah! Butler Sorn is not here, isn’t it?

336
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:02,159
Yes… Mister, Make way for me, please

337
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:04,599
It can fall down and hit you.

338
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:06,599
So, Do you need a hand?

339
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:08,519
That’s fine

340
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,519
This job is …

341
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,760
Heyyyyy

342
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:15,280
Heyyyyy

343
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,679
I'm sorry. Mister.

344
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,440
That’s fine

345
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:49,799
Mister

346
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,599
Your padlock necklace.

347
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It looks like my key chain.

348
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,759
Really!

349
00:21:02,879 --> 00:21:03,720
You have it

350
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,360
just like me.

351
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,879
So,

352
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,519
Can I try to unlock it?

353
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:14,840
Sure

354
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,919
Mister

355
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,280
finally

356
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,000
I finally found a soulmate.

357
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:52,960
Soulmate?

358
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,400
Yes!

359
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:56,000
Soulmate

360
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,879
It's you,

361
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,680
my soulmate.

362
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,079
Mister,

363
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,680
you are my soulmate

364
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,440
Looking for a long time.

365
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,680
Butler!

366
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,000
Butler!!

367
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,680
Aw! Just a dream?

368
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,000
I’m sorry, Mister

369
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,960
Are you alright?

370
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:24,840
Are you okay?

371
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:27,840
I…

372
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,599
Heyyy!!

373
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:30,680
Be careful

374
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,159
I think garden work doesn't suit you.

375
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,520
Yes, That’s true.

376
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,359
I…

377
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:44,680
Heyy!

378
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:47,159
Are you alright?

379
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,440
You're done.

380
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,599
It doesn’t really seem like it suits you.

381
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:52,800
I guess

382
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,919
we should have more gardeners.

383
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,039
Gardeners?

384
00:22:59,319 --> 00:22:59,680
Yes

385
00:23:05,306 --> 00:23:06,026
P’Thod

386
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:08,039
probably doesn’t accept that

387
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:11,199
Because this house

388
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,120
is hard for outsiders to get in and out.

389
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:19,440
So...

390
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:21,599
don’t worry,

391
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,440
I can handle it

392
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,000
all alone.

393
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,599
Well, okay

394
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,520
I’ll try to talk it over with N’Thep

395
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,319
And then

396
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,159
I’ll try to talk to P’Thod for you.

397
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,759
Well! Big smile on your face? Lazy, right?

398
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:44,040
No, sir.

399
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,560
I’ll do it if you want to.

400
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:49,480
So where is my saw?

401
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:50,719
I’ll do it on my own.

402
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,120
Where is it?

403
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,120
You’re

404
00:23:57,399 --> 00:23:59,399
not really like an old butler.

405
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:01,360
Why?

406
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,000
Nothing!

407
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,519
Go! Go get some rest.

408
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,440
You have to tell me first.

409
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:10,959
Yes

410
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,800
Oh Okay Thanks you

411
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:29,079
Hey! Girl

412
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:32,399
What why

413
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
Oh Man?

414
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,399
Oh Yes! I'm man but

415
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:37,719
My name isn't "Man".

416
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:40,839
What' gone?

417
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,560
Don't keep your eyes on me.
We'll be exposed.

418
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,040
What are you looking me?

419
00:24:48,199 --> 00:24:49,000
I'm sorry.

420
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,079
Ok

421
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,600
I get to go back.

422
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:04,759
How are you?

423
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:08,199
Geez!

424
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:11,199
Are you alright?

425
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,160
Who did that to you? Tell me.

426
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,279
I'm going to kill them.

427
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,600
Kill?

428
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:21,800
Um

429
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,519
Luv

430
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:26,319
Oh! Dad

431
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,600
Greetings, uncle.

432
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,800
Er.. Hey!

433
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,000
How you doin'?

434
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,560
When you were at Mister's house,
was he nice to you?

435
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,040
What's with the face?

436
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:46,920
Daddy

437
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,000
Can you watch over the shop for me?

438
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,079
Where are you going?

439
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,680
Come on! I'll be right back.

440
00:25:55,959 --> 00:25:57,079
Just watch over it for a moment.

441
00:25:57,719 --> 00:25:58,360
Alright!

442
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,040
Go and hurry back.

443
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:04,480
Understood.

444
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:05,959
I'll watch over it.

445
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,040
Let's go

446
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,240
Err..

447
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,959
It’s hot as hell, he still came
to do something sneaky.

448
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,399
What the heck?

449
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:26,272
Err..So offended

450
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,680
Charming Guy

451
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:36,319
I'm freaking fed up with
people who have a couple.

452
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,000
How so?

453
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,839
I'm all ears.

454
00:26:42,879 --> 00:26:44,519
It's nothing much.

455
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,399
How?

456
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,879
It's just…

457
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,199
I entered Mister's house.

458
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,480
Then mister let me…

459
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,959
So despise

460
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:02,759
offended charming guy

461
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,920
I want to drive to turn and bump into them.

462
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:07,319
Heyy Calm down!

463
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,279
And when it's night time.

464
00:27:12,879 --> 00:27:14,000
Mister will...

465
00:27:14,879 --> 00:27:16,759
still be sweet on each other.

466
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,000
Really?

467
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,000
I'm leaving! Too much love in the air!!

468
00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:25,519
Eager beaver, huh?

469
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,160
So sick of dogs but I
want to be sick as a dog.

470
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:28,279
Inn!

471
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,240
Calm down

472
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:31,639
How come?

473
00:27:32,879 --> 00:27:34,399
We have already received his money.

474
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,680
So what can I do to help?

475
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:49,160
Hm! Gotcha!

476
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:53,160
Mr. Thad, he is good to us.

477
00:27:54,192 --> 00:27:56,753
So I asked Mr. Thad to find more gardeners.

478
00:27:57,479 --> 00:27:58,560
Inn,

479
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:01,040
please come with us.

480
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:02,560
Huh?

481
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:05,440
If it's inconvenient.

482
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,920
No worries

483
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,479
I'll invite Mamuang instead.

484
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:12,920
Don't

485
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,680
Leave it to me!

486
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:20,640
Really?

487
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,599
Thank you very much.

488
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:28,440
You are awesome.

489
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,400
You are awesome.

490
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,680
Hmmmm

491
00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:38,359
Come for an interview or to investigate?

492
00:28:42,413 --> 00:28:46,212
Mister, this is the new gardener here.

493
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,440
What's your name.

494
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:50,160
My name is Mr. Thep.

495
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:52,040
Umm.

496
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,239
I'm Inn

497
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,400
Calm down.

498
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:58,599
Inn,

499
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,280
My name is Inn

500
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,520
And have you ever gardened before?

501
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:29,800
No,

502
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,599
I usually sell…

503
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:31,839
Hey!, You have!

504
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:34,680
So despicable.

505
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,640
I'm usually a gardener at the market.

506
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,119
Oh!

507
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:42,040
That's why.

508
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,319
P'Thod

509
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,479
Please, hire him.

510
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:51,999
So good.

511
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:53,719
Please

512
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:55,999
So what?

513
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,719
Does he have the strength or not?

514
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:03,160
This guy.

515
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,680
You're gonna get it! You're gonna get it!

516
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,440
Hey! Calm down.

517
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,760
Huh?

518
00:30:08,025 --> 00:30:09,385
Is there any? Is there any strength?

519
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,160
P'Thod, What do you think?

520
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:20,119
Err.. I don't want him.

521
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,160
Please.

522
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,280
Please! P'Thod Please.

523
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,479
Let's just say I hire him temporarily.

524
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:41,560
Yeah! New friend

525
00:30:43,239 --> 00:30:44,359
So sweet

526
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,160
But if the butler comes back

527
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:49,160
You must leave this house.

528
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,520
Butler Sin

529
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,520
Could you please inform
the new gardener of the rules?

530
00:30:57,719 --> 00:30:59,599
That all the people in this house

531
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:02,119
will comply with the rules strictly.

532
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,359
Yes

533
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:06,560
Done

534
00:31:07,239 --> 00:31:09,239
Maybe next time,
the sandbags probably won't be needed.

535
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,719
Sorry

536
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:19,880
Oh! Excuse me.

537
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,239
Oh! Yes, Yes, butler.

538
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:22,479
Follow me here

539
00:31:22,999 --> 00:31:24,359
I have something to take you to look at.
Where are you dragging me?

540
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,119
Oh yes,

541
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,920
P'Thad.

542
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,400
Please take care of the gardener.

543
00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:30,400
Bye Bye!

544
00:31:31,173 --> 00:31:33,173
Going here is like opening a boxing ring.

545
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:35,959
Err..

546
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:42,400
Aw.

547
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,719
Aren't you undressing today, Mister?

548
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:49,560
My pants are uncomfortable,
can I take them off?

549
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:53,199
Heyy!!

550
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:56,359
I can't take it anymore!!

551
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,199
What?

552
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,760
Just wait till next time,
It will be my day.

553
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,359
What?

554
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:04,359
Mark my words!

555
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:07,760
Hey, Where are you going in such a hurry?

556
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,160
I haven't taken it off yet.

557
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:10,400
Mister

558
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:13,040
Oh! I thought I'd be better than this.

559
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,800
So sweet

560
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:17,079
(Next Break)
Butler Luv

561
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:20,280
What did you call me?

562
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,999
What are you doing here?

563
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:25,599
And you bring an outsider here with you.

564
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,640
Here is your dress.

565
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,040
And change your clothes.

566
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,640
I'll talk to Mr. Thep.

567
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,520
Do I really have to wear this?

568
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,880
Wait for me, Mr. Thep.
Come. Come here.

569
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,240
Butler

570
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,520
What's going on?

571
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,560
Suddenly call me.

572
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,880
Butler Luv

573
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,480
Huh?

574
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,240
How can he know my name?

575
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,960
What?

576
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,520
What do you call me?

577
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,240
I called you, butler Luv.

578
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,960
What should I do now?

579
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,160
I'd run away.

580
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,960
Wait!

581
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,600
If you don't tell me the truth,

582
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,760
I'll tell P'Thod.

583
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,880
Please don't tell Mr. Thod.

584
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,880
I beg you.

585
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,680
Good.

586
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,320
Tell me now,

587
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,960
What are you doing here?

588
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,600
And bringing an outsider into my house.

589
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,760
Should I tell him?

590
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,600
I haven't stolen the necklaces yet.

591
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,520
Fine!

592
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:11,880
So??

593
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,480
Yes

594
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,960
my name is

595
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,840
Luv.

596
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,080
The story is...

597
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,240
What? His brother ran away?!

598
00:34:36,526 --> 00:34:36,926
Yes

599
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,080
I see.

600
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,520
If P'Thod know that,

601
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,000
He may kill...

602
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,080
Kill who?

603
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,080
All of us!

604
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:46,840
What?!

605
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,640
P'Thod doesn't like liars.

606
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,960
Really?

607
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,920
Huh? Let me peek to listen.

608
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,840
So now,

609
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,440
Why you bring your friend to be a gardener?

610
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,800
You have so many secret things.

611
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,680
Or you want me to tell P'Thod?

612
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,360
Please don't do that.

613
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
If you don't want that, what should I do?

614
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,120
The story is...

615
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,400
I...

616
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,240
I Like him.

617
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,200
Huh!?

618
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,000
You like the gardener??

619
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,240
He isn't a gardener.

620
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,240
He is my best friend.

621
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,720
I just...

622
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,960
want him to stay close to me.

623
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,960
So jealous.

624
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,120
Well,

625
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:06,960
he's so cute.

626
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,400
Yes.

627
00:36:22,442 --> 00:36:24,427
It's time to clean Mr. Thod's room now.

628
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,680
So,

629
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,840
excuse me.

630
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,200
Okay

631
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,960
Anyway

632
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,680
Mister,

633
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,560
how can you know that?

634
00:36:37,267 --> 00:36:38,707
Because I'm Mr. Thep,

635
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,640
An angel.

636
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,080
Angel?

637
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,760
What kind of angel?

638
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,760
Ah~

639
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,760
It's the word from future.

640
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,960
It means be an expert.

641
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,000
Ah~

642
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,200
I got it.

643
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,880
Excuse me.

644
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,880
Don't worry, I'll keep your secret.

645
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,960
Mr. Thod

646
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,120
May I come in?

647
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:29,840
Sure

648
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,440
I'm coming

649
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,880
To bring your night suit to wash
and clean your room.

650
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,760
Okay, go ahead.

651
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,000
Yes, sir.

652
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,440
Thank you.

653
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,760
Did you know,

654
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,320
what I hate the most?

655
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,320
Don't know?

656
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,200
I hate liars.

657
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,240
Huh?

658
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,680
Who is he talking with?

659
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,880
Me?

660
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,200
Because I think liars are dishonest.

661
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,840
Don't care?

662
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,240
That's the lock-shaped necklace!

663
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,440
Well,

664
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,560
I'd go to take a shower.

665
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,400
Whare are you looking at?

666
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,440
Is he gone?

667
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,080
What should I do?

668
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,080
Let peek a bit.

669
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,240
Okay!

670
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,320
He's taking a shower.

671
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,960
And that's the lock-shaped necklace.

672
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,200
Let me see.

673
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,080
His necklace and my key.

674
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,000
Can it unlock?

675
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,200
Diary? What's this?

676
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,320
What fell down?

677
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Let me see.

678
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,880
What are you doing?

679
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,560
Huh?

680
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,680
Your family won't have the right
to work in this house anymore.

681
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,880
Mr. Thod, please listen to me first.

682
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,880
I can explain that.

683
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,680
I give you 3 minutes to pack your things,

684
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,120
And leave from this house.

685
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,080
Please listen to me, I can explain!

686
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:35,960
Get out!

687
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,880
I said get out!

688
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,080
P'Thod

689
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,640
Stop!

690
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,840
I won't let anyone touch this thief.

691
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,560
Thief?

692
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,520
Who?

693
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,560
What's going on, P'Thod?

694
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:01,960
Mister

695
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,160
Get out!

696
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,840
Please don't chase me.

697
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,200
Get out!

698
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,360
You should tell me what happened?

699
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,160
It's not time to go out while raining.

700
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,320
Get out!

701
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,440
Get out!

702
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,360
Back off.

703
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,840
Get out.

704
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,680
Are you insane?

705
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,840
Are you insane?

706
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,680
Get out!

707
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,160
Wait! Butler wait!

708
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,840
Wait!

709
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,200
Where are you going?

710
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,360
It's raining, don't you see?

711
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,560
It's not your business.

712
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,280
It's not your business too.

713
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,960
It's not your place.

714
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,960
It's not our place?

715
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,040
Let's go.

716
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,120
(Next Episode)
You should go back.

717
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,800
I'll stay here.

718
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,240
What do you mean?

719
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,480
I know that P'Thod blames you.

720
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,680
I'm just piting you.

721
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,320
Mister Thad

722
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,640
But today...

723
00:43:43,215 --> 00:43:44,295
You have to stay outside.

724
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,600
Why you looking at me like that?

725
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,520
Are you hungry?

726
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,040
Mister Thad!! A shooting star!!

727
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,000
Let's pray quickly, sir.

728
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:49,760
Where is it?

729
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:51,920
N'Thep

730
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:52,920
What's going on?

731
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:57,400
Thiantangthong Subsinpermpoonmahasan

732
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,800
The youngest heir of the family.

733
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,080
You got me.
