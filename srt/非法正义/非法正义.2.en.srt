1
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,430
ALL CHARACTERS, EVENTS, LOCATIONS
AND INCIDENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,390
Jeong Deokheung, who was
released a few days ago...

3
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,770
Was found
murdered early yesterday.

4
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,850
After cutting
off his ankle monitor

5
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,270
and confusing police by making it look
like he was stowing away abroad...

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,086
He severely
injured a deliveryman

7
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,510
and a detective,
and even attempted

8
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:32,570
to murder the victim.

9
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,506
An unidentified
person appeared...

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,360
It turns out he was
killed after a fight.

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,700
Footage from
security cameras and dashcams

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,966
in the area have been analyzed

13
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,580
in order to find the person
who killed Jeong Deokheung.

14
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,540
However, according to the police,
the search has been fruitless so far.

15
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,830
HEAVEN'S NET I'M
SORRY. FORGIVE

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,710
"Heaven's net."

17
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,840
What does it mean?
Heaven's fishing net?

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,840
You idiot.

19
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,930
It refers to a net in the
heavens that catches sinners.

20
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,600
It's from Tao Te Ching.

21
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,640
It means that evil people
are eventually caught.

22
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,190
The bastard deserves
to go to hell

23
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,270
for what he did to
Detective Ko, but...

24
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,860
I agree.

25
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,400
Who the hell did this?

26
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,910
One thing is certain now.

27
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,040
There is

28
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,670
a vigilante.

29
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:34,420
VIGILANTE

30
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,060
As you can see, the footage from the night
of the incident is completely missing.

31
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,610
It seems the culprit took out the
chip after killing Jeong Deokheung.

32
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,270
So the culprit

33
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,690
didn't kill Jeong Deokheung
while helping the victim,

34
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,780
but he intended to kill
Jeong from the start?

35
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,990
Yes, sir.

36
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,910
"Heaven's net"
means "retribution."

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And seeing as he made him write it on
the wall in the midst of the chaos,

38
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,460
the culprit didn't want
to hide the incident,

39
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,750
but rather intended
to make headlines.

40
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,420
We should investigate
him as a murderer.

41
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,020
Turn on the TV.

42
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,840
Our
team at REPO25h

43
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,110
has exclusively obtained a photo of
Jeong Deokheung's murder scene again.

44
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,570
The shocking scene will
be revealed right now.

45
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,090
It is a wall in the
emergency staircase.

46
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,620
The first thing you see
as you go up the stairs is

47
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,740
what Jeong wrote
in his own blood.

48
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,620
"Heaven's net." It's
from Tao Te Ching and...

49
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,710
What is that?

50
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,380
Did you not secure
the crime scene?

51
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,920
You're already losing
the public opinion race?

52
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,260
I'm sorry, sir.

53
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,680
Stop the media before
it gets louder.

54
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,310
And investigate him as
a murderer. Understood?

55
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,440
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

56
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,860
Come in.

57
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,780
- Did you call for me?
- Yes, because...

58
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,820
You know about the
incident in Seoul, right?

59
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,040
I've been called to
join the investigation.

60
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,170
So I think I'm going
to be a little busy.

61
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,420
You're going to have to continue
developing the app without me.

62
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,590
I'll check in
whenever I have time.

63
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:44,220
Yes, sir. By the way, is it
the Jeong Deokheung case?

64
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,430
Yes.

65
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,100
They must be
having a hard time.

66
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,680
Public opinion is going crazy,

67
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,480
and the police have no clues.

68
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,980
Since there's no CCTV
or dashcam footage.

69
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,900
Professor, maybe it's someone
who lives in the apartment?

70
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,030
What?

71
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,110
Maybe he killed Jeong Deokheung
while helping the victim

72
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,780
and hid because he got scared.

73
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,240
I don't know.

74
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,160
Judging by the writing on the
wall, I think the Vigilante did it.

75
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,710
Vigilante?

76
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,880
Min Seonwook.

77
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:26,430
Do you have to use the name the
third-rate trashy media came up with?

78
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,100
I'm sorry, sir.

79
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,570
- We're the police.
- Yes, sir.

80
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,270
Good. Anyway, make sure
you only work in this room.

81
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,730
And the data can't
leave the room.

82
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,150
Okay.

83
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,666
- I'll get going.
- Yes, sir.

84
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,400
- Good-bye, sir.
- I'll be in touch.

85
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,530
Yes, sir.

86
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,790
My goodness. Not a single
clue left after all this mess.

87
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,840
This is no ordinary guy.

88
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,170
I'm sure it's someone who knows
how the police investigate.

89
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,720
Why don't you meet
Kim Siyoon, Professor?

90
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,640
She's the only witness, but
she won't say anything to us.

91
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,680
No.

92
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,480
She won't say anything
even if she saw something.

93
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,230
I'm sure.

94
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,860
The shock aside...

95
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,690
Anyway, maybe after
some time, but not now.

96
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,820
Excuse me.

97
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,650
Why are you investigating
the Vigilante?

98
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,660
You can't come in
here, kid. Get out.

99
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,910
The Vigilante saved the victim's
life. You should reward him.

100
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,990
All right. Let's go.

101
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,250
Why are you investigating
him as a murderer?

102
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,330
- Am I wrong?
- Come on.

103
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:40,290
- Let go of me. What are the police doing?
- Watch your head. Come on.

104
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,840
We've been getting a lot of calls
complaining about the investigation.

105
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:49,890
We have to put an end to it before
more people start to react like that.

106
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,520
IS THIS REALLY RIGHT?

107
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,730
IT'S A PROBLEM REGARDLESS

108
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:56,810
WHY IS REPO25H...

Why aren't you
answering the phones?

114
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,880
Don't answer them. We can't work
if we respond to every call.

115
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,350
The viewer board is down, too!

116
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:39,140
I told you this case was
going to shake society.

117
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,730
But we're getting
criticized, too.

118
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,240
They say the Vigilante is a criminal
and we're making it look interesting.

119
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,320
REPO25h has never been
criticized this much! Am I wrong?

120
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,320
Let them criticize
as much as they want.

121
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,700
They're criticizing
because they're watching.

122
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,660
You know they are
our true fans, right?

123
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,250
Stop playing around with words!

124
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,920
We must play our
role as the press...

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,710
Mr. Kwak Changhyun!

126
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:13,760
The media gets power
from ratings and views.

127
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,060
Weren't you the one who
whined about our low ratings?

128
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,480
The Vigilante watched REPO25h

129
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,060
and punished a
terrible criminal.

130
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,400
Our role?

131
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,320
It's to provide the best show
on the planet for our viewers!

132
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,240
We're the Vigilante
promoter! Okay?

133
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,570
Okay.

134
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,410
Then we're using a
criminal like Jeong as material again?

135
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,330
Why back down now?

136
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,080
It was a huge hit.

137
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,550
We need to hit harder.
With a villain concept.

138
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,850
Who are you going to choose?

139
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,440
All three.

140
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,230
What?

141
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,440
Let's see

142
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,820
who the Vigilante chooses.

143
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,490
We'll figure out

144
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,660
his preferences and
distract the police.

00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,040
I think the guy who
killed Jeong Deokheung is

147
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,300
a psychopath for sure. Right?

148
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,430
Leaving such a phrase increases
the possibility of getting caught.

149
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,390
But he chose to
provoke the police.

150
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,310
Right? It's rather
ostentatious and narcissistic.

151
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:44,310
He seems to be highly-educated
and possess leadership qualities.

152
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,690
Like Jiyong?

153
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,730
Hey, how could you say
that about your friend?

154
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,610
But that's very
accurate.

155
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,320
Doesn't it look like
more of a warning?

156
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,780
Like, this is what happens
when you do bad things.

157
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,490
Plus analysis skills!

158
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,490
By the way, did you learn those skills
while developing the profiling app?

159
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,120
Even the freshmen
know that, you idiot.

160
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,040
Through financial settlement
with victims and apology letters...

161
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,130
What is that?

162
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,300
Why are they revealing
three? Are they leftovers?

163
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,460

Broke into the house of his
ex-employer with runaway teens...

176
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,600
and brutally murdered the
children and their mother.

177
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,720
Stay in the room.

178
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:46,810
Stop crying!

179
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,980
I told you not to cry. Why
won't you listen to me?

180
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,140
I'll give you all I have.

181
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,650
Be quiet.

TO GO CLUBBING?

186
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,880
He went to a karaoke bar...

187
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,750
after the murder.

188
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
LET'S PARTY!

189
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,310
DO YOU EVEN FEEL SORRY? ABOUT
HOW WRONGFULLY THEY DIED?

190
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,110
COME AND SAY THAT TO MY
FACE! I'LL KILL YOU TOO

191
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,860
DOOYEOP, LET'S DRINK
AND GET HIGH ALL NIGHT!

00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,030
WHAT? YOU GOT OUT? NO WAY

Cuntacc...

194
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,130
You're going home.
Why the long face?

195
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,590
He's just cooped up at home on
weekends. How can he be happy?

196
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,640
I'd rather stay in the
dorm if I were him.

197
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,600
I would, too.

198
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,390
So why don't you go
clubbing with us tonight?

199
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,770
I'll let you come in
first in the finals.

200
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,360
Keep your promise.

201
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,570
- What?
- What?

202
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,780
- Are you serious?
- Are you serious?

203
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,330
Hey. My God...

204
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,290
Come here.

205
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,420
Hurry up.

206
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,050
Come on!

207
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,520
- Lady.
- What would you like?

208
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,930
Three Jack and Cokes.

209
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,060
Guys, we've worked really
hard for the last two weeks.

210
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,150
Let's have some fun.

211
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,320
All right? Let's have fun.

212
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,280
Locked eyes with anyone? I
told you, we need three girls.

213
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,330
Hey, she's coming
for me. I'll be back.

214
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,880
What the... We ordered
three Jack and Cokes.

215
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,100
How old are you?

216
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,140
I'm just a college student.

217
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,980
Me, too.

218
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,530
Hey.

219
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,400
Tequila. Two shots please.

220
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,530
There really is something
called fate. Think about it.

221
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,450
Who knew my life would turn
around like this in prison?

222
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,620
Right? Sungyeol, you should
seize this opportunity.

223
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,540
I'll introduce you to Junsik
directly soon. All right?

224
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,590
Then you'll pay off your
gambling debt in no time.

225
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,840
By the way, how did you get out
so quickly after killing someone?

226
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,590
Did Junsik help with that, too?

227
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,140
What? What's so funny?

228
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,770
What is it?

229
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,690
The three of us got
our story straight.

230
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,560
That I wasn't the one who
killed the woman and the kids.

231
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:25,400
They were minors, so they wouldn't
have gotten heavy sentences.

232
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,490
Really? That worked?

233
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:31,070
Of course. There was
no evidence, you know?

234
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,200
Don't you know?

235
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,620
Innocent until proven
guilty.

236
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,040
The Korean law is
freaking amazing.

237
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,000
Innocent until proven guilty!

238
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,590
Isn't it a bit hot in here?

239
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,680
Want to go cool off somewhere?

240
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,690
Are you here for Cool Dooyeop?

241
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,030
Who?

242
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,820
You've been staring at
Dooyeop the whole time.

243
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,710
Oh... I was just wondering
if he was the guy on TV.

244
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,000
That's not why you
were looking at him.

245
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,090
It's because of this, right?

246
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,390
But you can't buy it.

247
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,060
He only sells it to
international students.

248
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,020
Right...

249
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,860
I'll just find
someone else then.

250
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,830
Oh, you're here?

251
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,630
I'm sorry. See that book there?

252
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,010
I fell asleep while studying.

253
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,090
I'll get going. Bye.

254
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,180
- Bye.
- Okay.

255
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:38,930
Oh, right.

256
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,640
Did you get home
okay last night?

257
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,810
Nothing happened
at the club, right?

258
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,400
Yeah, I just went home.

259
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,940
Right. I thought so.

260
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,030
I was too busy hanging
out with a girl. Sorry.

261
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,320
I'll look out for
you next time. Okay?

262
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,410
I mean,

263
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:06,910
you're not the
one-night-stand type of guy, right?

264
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,040
You went home, right?

265
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,880
All right.

266
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,840
Bye. Bye.

267
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:44,910
COOL DOOYEOP, TAKE A LOOK. IT'S THE
ACCOUNT OF THE WOMAN YOU KILLED.

268
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:02,890
Milky
way in the blue sky

269
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:07,350
In a small white boat

270
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,820
The Korean law is
freaking amazing.

271
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,450
Innocent until proven guilty!

274
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,050
FOR THE LAST 5 YEARS

275
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,300
Run by separate groups,

276
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,430
and with cash transactions only.

277
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,580
I had fun the other night.

278
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,600
A system in which only
dealers get caught.

279
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,440
Yes, sir.

280
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,360
- Well done.
- Thank you.

281
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,810
BUSAN DEA

282
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,980
WE ARE HERE FOR YOU!

283
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,780
I don't
think it's working.

284
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,160
Should we postpone
the recording?

285
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,660
It's been quiet for
three weeks already.

286
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,160
Or he may have
punished someone else,

287
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,380
and we don't know about it.

288
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,040
No?

289
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,510
Everyone's on alert,

290
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,510
so he might be waiting
for the right time.

291
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,730
Let's go harder
today. Emotionally.

292
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,070
Okay.

293
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,190
What do you think,
Producer Kwon?

294
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,110
Well, I thought it was
getting kind of plain.

295
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,700
Sounds good. Yes.

296
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,630
What?

297
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:27,010
Who left this on my car?
What a piece of trash.

298
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,470
TURN YOURSELF IN

299
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,270
Yo! What's up, bro?

300
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,030
Hey, Sungyeol, I'll give
you a phone number now.

301
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,150
Call and find out who it is.

302
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,570
Right
now? I'm kind of busy.

303
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,530
You idiot!

304
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,250
I'm asking you because
it's fucking urgent.

305
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,580
Why the fuck are you
yelling at me? What is it?

306
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,120
What's the number?

307
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,880
051-903-0427.

308
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,050
Find out and call me back.

309
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,380
Okay, I got it. I'll
do it right now.

310
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,060
Did you call it?

311
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,270
What the hell? It's a number
of a DEA agent in Busan.

312
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,360
Busan?

313
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,570
So what did you say?

314
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:26,780
What do you think?

315
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,070
I lied and said that I dialed
the wrong number, you punk.

316
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,070
Good. Well done.

317
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,990
Hang up the phone and
lie low for a while.

318
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,620
If they call you back, tell
them you don't know me.

319
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,370
God damn it.

320
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,000
The loan sharks are already
on my ass, for God's sake.

321
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,090
Anyway, I got it.

322
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,140
Hello.

323
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:13,950
- Good job.
- Thank you.

324
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,580
By the way...

325
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:25,330
do these books come in
from Busan, by any chance?

326
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:34,680
I was just curious because
they're written in Japanese.

327
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,300
I'll get going, then.

328
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,940
- Dooyeop!
- Fuck.

329
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,360
Hey, you...

330
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,700
Did the books come in?

331
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,110
Forget it. Just go.

332
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:59,160
What the hell? Then why
did you post it online?

333
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,790
Stop bothering me and just go.

334
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,660
And I didn't fucking
post anything!

335
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,370
Why are you yelling at me?

336
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,750
I know it's in here.

337
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,960
- Hey, stop it and just go, for God's sake.
- Come on!

338
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,050
Get lost...

339
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,210
- Move aside.
- We already know.

340
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,010
Fuck off!

341
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,630
Shit. What the fuck!

342
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,100
Seo Dooyeop.

343
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,470
Who are you?

344
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:09,770
Hey, they're mine.
Don't touch them.

345
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,480
I was worried the
police might catch you.

346
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,950
Don't.

347
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,910
The heavens also
want it this way.

348
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,830
Hey, don't. Stop
it, you bastard!

349
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,120
You bastard!

350
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,840
Did Junsik send
you? To cut me off?

351
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,510
Repent.

352
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,310
Apologize to the
family you killed.

353
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,520
What? Repent?

354
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,190
I thought Junsik sent you.
You had me there for a second.

355
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,990
You son of a bitch.

356
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,620
Hey.

357
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,330
Hey! Fuck!

358
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,930
Do you know what
you've done? You shit.

359
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,440
Who the hell are you?

360
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,110
Please spare me.

361
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,860
You didn't spare them.

362
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:24,280
They begged you to spare them,

363
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,830
but you killed them anyway!

364
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,750
Please don't kill me.

365
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,670
Please,

366
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,130
spare me...

367
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,440
Milky way...

368
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,520
Remember them?

369
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:04,950
In a small white boat

370
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:09,660
Is a laurel and a rabbit

371
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,740
Apologize.

372
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,250
To Seungwoo.

373
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,290
To Seungwoo's mother.

374
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,380
To Seungmi. Admit that
you deserve to die.

375
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,470
Yes. I'll
apologize.

376
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,310
Baby's journey to
the West Country

377
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:35,100
Is going smoothly

378
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,270
Stop!

379
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,390
It seems someone took out
the dashcam's memory card.

380
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,310
How did you find this place?

381
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:19,270
Seo Dooyeop's phone was turned
on and tracked to this location.

382
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,860
This was the last
screen on his phone.

383
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,190
He was looking at that
moments before dying?

384
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,660
It's the account of the victim
that Seo Dooyeop killed.

385
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,660
Sir.

386
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,410
There are a lot of press
requests. What should we do?

387
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,910
Reject all of them, or
it'll get out of control.

388
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,620
Yes, sir.

389
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:53,220
As an organization that
protects our people,

390
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,060
the police promise to put
an end to the criminal acts

391
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,850
disturbing the public
order as soon as possible.

392
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,940
We promise that there will not be any
more victims related to this case.

393
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,280
What's the Vigilante doing?

394
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,780
- Why are they trying to catch him?
- I know, right?

395
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,610
I'm going to write a comment.

396
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,160
We will make it clear
that criminals must only

397
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,250
be punished by the law.

398
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,596
INVESTIGATION
HEADQUARTERS FORMED

399
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,670
As this is an issue with
heightened public attention,

400
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:25,880
a special investigation headquarters
will be formed with the cooperation

401
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,010
of all agencies and
police personnel.

402
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:33,300
We will do everything we can to capture
the criminal as soon as possible.

403
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,930
Why do you think he's
called the Vigilante?

404
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,930
Why are people
going wild over him?

405
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:41,310
Because people are discontent
with the current legal system.

406
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:43,230
What are you talking about?

407
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:46,860
Are you saying it's okay
to beat up or kill people?

408
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,400
Why does the law exist?

409
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,450
It exists to judge fairly and
impartially without getting emotional.

410
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,830
Right. Fairly and impartially.

411
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:58,910
But look at how they rule.

412
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,120
The judges ignore the weak.

413
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,580
They judge without paying enough
attention to what victims have to say.

414
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:07,710
Isn't that why people are
crazy for the Vigilante?

415
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,630
Why do you keep
calling him the Vigilante?

416
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,800
He's nothing but a criminal.

417
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:19,850
The star is here!

418
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:22,230
Ms. Choi!

419
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,310
- Choi!
- You're the best!

420
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,480
Our ad spots are sold out!

421
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,230
And the rates have soared, too!

422
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,320
And what else?

423
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,490
We're getting a lot of calls.

424
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:33,030
The director loves it.
He's over the moon!

425
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:38,280
Here's a cake for you!

426
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:43,870
- Blow out the candles!
- Blow out the candles!

427
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,380
Turn on the lights!

428
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,630
What the hell are you doing?

429
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,720
We have to find out
where Seo Dooyeop died

430
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,260
and prepare for the broadcast
about the Vigilante!

431
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,940
I already looked into it.

432
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,110
They rejected interview requests and
only disclosed simple information.

433
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,190
Simple information?

434
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,900
- Let me see.
- Hey, show her.

435
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,110
Just a second.

436
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,280
Here.

437
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,870
HAN RIVER FOUL PLAY MURDER
CASE INVESTIGATION REPORT

438
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,000
There are photos.

439
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:34,220
The Han River. Someplace
where there are few people.

440
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:37,340
The grass! The piers!

441
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:43,020
The Vigilante bit the bait we
put a lot of effort into, again.

442
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:48,350
And you're going to doze
off, eat chicken, dance,

443
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,020
and have fun drinking beer?

444
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,190
She's right. Let's
clean this up.

445
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,570
And let's get back to work

446
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,290
and work hard together
with a sense of purpose.

447
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,120
Let's work.

448
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:07,120
Don't throw away the sauce.

449
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,750
Divide the areas, narrow them down,
and check the street views thoroughly!

450
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,920
- Okay.
- On it.

451
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,130
Han and the camera
crew, follow me.

452
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,220
- Okay.
- Okay.

453
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,300
Where are you going?

454
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:23,350
Can't you see what
the public wants?

455
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,440
All right.

456
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,740
MORE CRIMINALS
TURNING THEMSELVES IN

457
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,650
RELEASED PRISONERS
SHIVERING WITH FEAR

458
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:42,620
Crime rates have decreased this
month all thanks to the Vigilante?

459
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,700
Please...

460
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,540
This is why reporters
are called trash.

461
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,660
Goodness.

462
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,170
God damn it!

463
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,670
Let's do as we're ordered.
What choice do we have?

464
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,510
Sir. How did it go?

465
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,800
The regional unit's taking over.

466
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:03,300
Does that mean it's
out of our hands now?

467
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,680
No. We'll be working with them.

468
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:07,930
With the regional unit.

469
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,980
You mean, with that
monster team leader?

470
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,780
COLLECT BILLS AND COINS HERE

471
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,220
That's mine.

472
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:45,890
Mr. Koo Sungyeol, right?
I'm with the police.

473
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:50,020
May I talk to you for a moment?

474
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,690
The police?

475
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,440
I have nothing to say.
Give me back my coin.

476
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,960
It won't take long.

477
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,420
Please make time for me.

478
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,340
Seriously,
what is this about?

479
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,680
Are you a loan shark?

480
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,090
I really am a cop.

481
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,430
Sir.

482
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,520
I promise I'll pay you
back within this month.

483
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,310
I started a new job.

484
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,150
I can make the 90
million in no time.

485
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,650
When you met Seo Dooyeop...

486
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,070
Dooyeop?

487
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:43,030
Did you see anyone
suspicious around you?

488
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,450
So you really aren't
Mr. Kim's guy?

489
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:52,660
What the fuck? Are you
fucking kidding me?

490
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,870
I thought you were
here to collect money!

491
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,080
What the hell is this?

492
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,840
A cop dragging people
out here like this?

493
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,420
Who the fuck do you think you
are? Do you have a warrant?

494
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,380
You don't seem to get it.

495
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,850
Mr. Koo Sungyeol.

496
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:14,230
From now on, I'll speak
informally to you.

497
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,310
Go ahead, you fucking pig.

498
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,400
Jerks only understand
when I speak informally.

499
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,580
I am a cop, but not
the one you know.

500
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,160
I'll ask you again.

501
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:37,170
Have you seen anyone suspicious
around Seo Dooyeop recently?

502
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,790
Someone you've
never seen before.

503
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,210
Come to think of it,

504
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,840
Dooyeop told me...

505
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,920
You piece of shit!

506
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,970
Son of a bitch.

507
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,480
No. Please...

508
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,690
- Three.
- Please!

509
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:58,100
Two.

510
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,230
He suddenly

511
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:03,690
gave me a Busan DEA agent's number and
asked me to call and find out who it was.

512
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,780
One!

513
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,790
I don't know
who you're looking for,

514
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,160
but if they met at the club,

515
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,330
it can't be someone old.

516
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,290
It must be a young
person. Probably.

517
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,170
Please.

518
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,500
It must be someone young.

519
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:35,520
Yes, this is Jo Heon, team
leader of the regional unit.

520
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:44,900
Don't worry.

521
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:49,030
This is not the age
of Arsene Lupin.

522
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,820
The evidence will turn up.

523
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,660
And he'll get caught eventually.

524
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,210
I guarantee it.

525
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,180
People will forget
about the Vigilante.

526
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,600
I will make sure of it.
