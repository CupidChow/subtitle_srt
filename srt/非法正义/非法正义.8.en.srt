1
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,020
ALL CHARACTERS, EVENTS, LOCATIONS
AND INCIDENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,651
Sir.

3
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:29,446
Choi Miryeo's been missing
for a few days now.

4
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,168
Who's the Vigilante?

5
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:48,090
That's what I'd like to know, too.

6
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,645
You've been inciting people with him.

7
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,731
Just kill me and pray for me, brother.

8
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:07,568
"Brother"?

9
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,320
You're wearing a rosary ring.

10
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,239
No?

11
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,077
Stop trying to get something out of me.

12
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,205
It makes me want to kill you.

13
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,043
So you believe in God?

14
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,964
Why? Because you've done
so many bad things?

15
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:34,845
I haven't seen a tough one
like you in a while.

16
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,084
It's open.

17
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,798
Ms. Choi?

18
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,441
How about table tennis this time?

19
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,652
Let's play.

20
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,195
- Sounds good.
- You're good at it.

21
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,279
Yeah, I am.

22
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:39,785
I need to take this call.

23
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,330
Yeah, what's up?

24
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,665
<i>Hey, Jiyong.</i>

25
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,459
Choi Miryeo's been out of touch
for a few days.

26
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,253
<i>It seems she was kidnapped.</i>

27
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,464
It was bound to happen anyway.

28
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,591
Let's go.

29
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:58,887
Okay.

30
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,397
TO ALL WHO PASS THROUGH HERE,
THE COUNTRY HAS FAITH IN YOU

31
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,319
VIGILANTE

32
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,713
What? What's going on?

33
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,716
- Hey, go check.
- Yes, sir.

34
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,760
- You go with him, fool.
- Yes, sir.

35
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,144
Who are you?

36
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:48,937
The Vigilante?

37
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,606
It's the Vigilante!

38
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,651
- The Vigilante's here!
- What's going on?

39
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,532
Get him!

40
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:03,202
Get that guy!

41
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:06,622
The Vigilante's here.

42
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,834
Yes. I'll leave
with the money right away. Yes, sir.

43
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:17,925
Read it out loud.

44
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,511
BY 7 P.M. TOMORROW, BRING CHOI MIRYEO

45
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,639
Boss,
please send more of our men.

46
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,143
I said read it.

47
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,188
"By 7:00 p.m. tomorrow,

48
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:36,193
"bring Choi Miryeo
to the World Cup Stadium concert hall."

49
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:41,198
<i>"I'll give you the crypto wallet
in exchange for Choi Miryeo."</i>

50
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,450
<i>"If you don't bring her,</i>

51
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:48,705
<i>"I'll throw the crypto wallet
into the Han River."</i>

52
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,291
Hello? Hello?

53
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:59,675
He must think we have Choi Miryeo.

54
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,055
Mr. Bang.

55
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,474
Sir?

56
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:11,812
Interesting.

57
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,065
We now have...

58
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:17,943
a hand to play.

59
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:20,696
Right?

60
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,827
Things became complicated
because of that bastard,

61
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:28,787
but still.

62
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,801
Please don't kill me, sir.

63
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,433
I won't make another mistake!

64
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,686
Please give me one more chance, sir.

65
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,897
- Really?
- Yes, sir!

66
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,025
I'll do anything. Please don't kill me.

67
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:00,319
Bullshit.

68
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:01,945
Sir!

69
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:03,906
Sir, wait!

70
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,741
Hey, bring him in!

71
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,577
Don't touch me, you sons of bitches!
Stay away, you fucks!

72
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:10,871
Fuck!

73
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,749
You motherfuckers, let go of me!

74
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,960
- Yang, please!
- Hold him tight!

75
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,087
- Yang!
- Relax.

76
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,924
No, wait. Wait! Fuck, let go of me!

77
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,550
- Relax.
- Yang.

78
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,552
- Yang, don't kill me!
- Hey, push him.

79
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,679
Yang, please!

80
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:31,016
Yang, don't kill me!

81
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,685
Kim Samdoo, you son of a bitch!

82
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,773
- Hello?
<i>- Mr. Bang.</i>

83
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,900
Thank you for taking my call.

84
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,070
<i>I'll cut to the chase
and make you an offer.</i>

85
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:44,696
What is it?

86
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,282
You have Choi Miryeo, right?

87
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,660
So?

88
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,371
<i>I'll pay three times
what the Vole promised.</i>

89
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:53,872
Hand her to me.

90
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,668
The Vigilante must've contacted you.

91
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,796
You don't need to know.

92
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,174
It's not a very tempting offer.

93
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,342
Five times.

94
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:10,013
When and where we'll meet
the Vigilante is already set.

95
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,727
I'll just take my crypto wallet back
and let you kill the Vigilante.

96
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:17,479
<i>It's a win-win.</i>

97
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:21,692
I mean, you always pay your debts.

98
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:25,153
You can't live without paying him back,

99
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:26,989
<i>can you?</i>

100
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,157
All right, then.

101
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,827
I'll text you the place and time.

102
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,964
He's pretty much done for.
Do we need to save him?

103
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,552
I'm not saving him. I'm finishing him off.

104
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,055
Will Mr. Bang do as we say?

105
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:53,724
Yang.

106
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:55,767
Yes?

107
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,270
Mr. Yang.

108
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:04,568
Yes, sir?

109
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,240
Gather all our guys. Everyone.

110
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,952
We'll wipe them all out
once we get the wallet.

111
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:16,455
Understood, sir.

112
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:19,750
If we don't kill them,

113
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,211
we'll die.

114
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:29,968
Kim Samdoo's gathering his men.

115
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,721
He wants his wallet back at all cost.

116
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,058
So what now? Do you have a plan?

117
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,709
Jiyong.

118
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,091
What are you up to these days?

119
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,094
You shouldn't have missed classes today.

120
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:15,305
You already missed some
because of that accident.

121
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,558
You're not going to become an officer?

122
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:24,273
You said we should believe
in reforming people.

123
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,193
It's not too late yet.

124
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,614
Don't skip school tomorrow.

125
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:52,236
YONG GUKBAP RESTAURANT

126
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:02,598
- Thank you for the food, sir.
- Thank you for the food.

127
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:09,354
Sir, by any chance is there soju...

128
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,566
Never mind, sir.

129
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,293
Is it good?

130
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:34,505
Yes, sir. It's good.

131
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,715
It's not free.

132
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:41,929
SEGYE BATHHOUSE

133
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,876
Wash up and get changed.

134
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,962
We've brought your clothes,
so you'll be fine.

135
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,132
What are you doing?

136
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:20,717
The Vigilante wants you.

137
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,681
We'll exchange you for the crypto wallet,
so we need to make you look nice.

138
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,065
What's so funny?

139
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,943
God, I love it.

140
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:40,737
This situation is so satisfying.

141
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:46,702
Crazy bitch.

142
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:48,370
Untie her.

143
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,486
Begin.

144
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,040
You can't come in here.

145
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,461
What are you doing? Please leave now!

146
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,129
Just shut up.

147
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,924
Get out.

148
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,800
<i>Sir, everyone's in position.</i>

149
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:44,968
Good job.

150
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:48,472
If a man in a black hoodie,
or Mr. Bang appears, tell me right away.

151
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,926
Sir, the Vigilante is here.

152
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:27,928
<i>What?</i>

153
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:32,140
But there's a lot of them.

154
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:34,685
What do you mean? Be more clear.

155
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:35,894
The thing is...

156
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:38,146
Vigilantes keep coming out of the station.

157
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,467
That bastard...

158
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:51,011
This bastard's smarter than I thought.

159
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:52,471
Should I turn back?

160
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,557
We should keep
the promise we made. Keep going.

161
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:02,981
It really is a festival.

162
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:19,831
If you see the Vigilante,
stop where you are.

163
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,125
If you do anything, you die.

164
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:26,630
Okay.

165
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:28,757
Go.

166
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:44,648
Sir.

167
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,650
<i>Choi Miryeo and Soedol are here.</i>

168
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,862
They're moving from the parking lot
to the hall entrance.

169
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:50,946
What about Mr. Bang?

170
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:53,574
I don't see him.

171
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:55,701
What should we do, sir?

172
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:12,926
Buy your merch here!

173
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,011
Hey, wait.

174
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,013
You need black outfits on to enter.

175
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:39,494
<i>So what now? Do you have a plan?</i>

176
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,038
It's likely Kim Samdoo...

177
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:46,126
will try to kill me, Mr. Bang,
and even Eom Jaehyub.

178
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:50,589
Because that's the only way
for him to survive.

179
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:52,758
Mr. Bang?

180
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,969
Kim Samdoo isn't the one

181
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:59,556
who has Choi Miryeo.
It's Mr. Bang.

182
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,435
Once the fight begins,

183
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:05,354
find Kim Samdoo and lure him in,

184
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:07,439
so everyone can be in one place.

185
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,316
Let's go in.

186
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:11,235
Yes, sir.

187
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:47,915
That bastard!

188
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,002
Hey, Samdoo!

189
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:41,093
Who are you?

190
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:46,056
Who do you think?

191
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,851
I'm the demon who's after you,
you bastard!

192
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:03,073
Get him!

193
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,533
- Get him!
- Get that bastard!

194
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:05,826
Hey!

195
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:08,620
<i>So you and I are going to take on
all of them by ourselves?</i>

196
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:11,039
It'll be such an exciting day.

197
00:22:11,123 --> 00:22:13,333
Once it begins, Jo Heon will come.

198
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:14,626
Eom Jaehyub, too.

199
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:18,130
Because Choi Miryeo will stream it live.

200
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:41,028
Here. Stream it live.

201
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:46,575
This is the only way to get them.

202
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,293
Breaking news, everyone.

203
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:41,839
I am now at World Cup Stadium.

204
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:57,646
<i>After the Vigilante stole
the crypto wallet,</i>

205
00:23:57,729 --> 00:24:02,568
<i>he's once again fighting the duo
who recently attacked a police officer.</i>

206
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,293
- Just get in!
- But...

207
00:24:46,195 --> 00:24:49,489
What? There's another Vigilante?

208
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,952
Yes, and there might be more.

209
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:58,207
- Get him!
- Get that bastard!

210
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:00,542
- Hey!
- You bastard!

211
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:08,926
- Move aside!
- Hey, move.

212
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:13,639
Hey! Kill them all!

213
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:28,820
Do you see this, everyone?

214
00:25:29,947 --> 00:25:32,824
Kim Samdoo and the members
of Sewool Future Resources

215
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:36,161
have come here to kill the Vigilante.

216
00:25:36,245 --> 00:25:39,665
Everyone, this place is a chaotic area
of lawlessness right now.

217
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:43,961
Don't worry about the campaign funds.

218
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:45,796
I'll prepare more than enough.

219
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:46,880
Goodness.

220
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:49,341
I appreciate it.

221
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:52,511
I'll put in a good word
for you with the VIP.

222
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:55,848
- Thank you, sir.
- Cheers.

223
00:25:59,101 --> 00:26:03,230
Sir, the Vigilante and Kim Samdoo's men
are fighting at World Cup Stadium.

224
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:05,691
And Choi Miryeo's streaming it live.

225
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:10,112
Mr. Eom.

226
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:14,533
You haven't taken care of her yet?

227
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:18,579
I'm sorry, sir.

228
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:19,872
Leave right now.

229
00:26:20,455 --> 00:26:21,957
Go take care of it yourself.

230
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:27,254
- But sir...
- Leave right now, you motherfucker.

231
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:31,675
Yes, sir.

232
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,534
Get him now!

233
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:03,165
You idiots!

234
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:07,586
Do you really think the Vigilante
brought the crypto wallet here?

235
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:12,007
If he dies here, how will you find it?

236
00:27:13,634 --> 00:27:16,303
What are you doing,
you idiots? Get her now!

237
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:17,679
- Get her!
- Get her!

238
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:19,723
- Get her!
- Get that bitch!

239
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,850
Get her! Hurry!

240
00:27:23,477 --> 00:27:24,686
God damn it!

241
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:27,773
Get them!

242
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:31,235
Hey! Turn that off!

243
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,461
Fuck!

244
00:28:26,832 --> 00:28:28,250
This is the police!

245
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:31,378
Everyone drop your weapons

246
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:35,632
and get down on the ground
with your hands behind your back.

247
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:39,887
If you do as I say,
I'll treat you like humans at least.

248
00:28:43,432 --> 00:28:45,893
Hey, Wasp and Squeezer.

249
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:48,187
What are you doing?

250
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:49,813
Go get Jo Heon.

251
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:52,858
Mr. Bang?

252
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:57,112
I said drop your weapons!

253
00:28:58,363 --> 00:28:59,907
What are you doing?

254
00:29:00,449 --> 00:29:03,577
Kill him! Just kill all of them!

255
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:53,710
Seonwook?

256
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:57,005
Jiyong.

257
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:02,803
Hey, what's going on?

258
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:05,055
What are you doing here?

259
00:30:05,931 --> 00:30:07,724
Why on Earth are you here?

260
00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:12,688
What about you?
What the hell are you doing here?

261
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,565
Answer me.

262
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:28,620
Seonwook.

263
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:30,539
<i>This is the police!</i>

264
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:32,291
Please take him to the hospital.

265
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:34,334
Please.

266
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:36,962
The police are here.

267
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:39,464
What are you going to do?

268
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:41,967
Jiyong.

269
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:44,845
I'll believe what you're doing...

270
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:48,432
is the right thing.

271
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:03,655
Soedol, I'll be right back.

272
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:20,255
<i>I repeat!</i>

273
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:31,183
Jiyong!

274
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:33,936
You son of a bitch!

275
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:36,063
Get him!

276
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:51,745
Get them now!

277
00:31:52,621 --> 00:31:53,622
Kill them!

278
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:09,012
Try and fucking stab me!

279
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:39,084
Tonight, we all die here.

280
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:41,211
No one gets out.

281
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:43,672
You sound like you're some hero.

282
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:47,050
Stop pretending
like you have a sad backstory,

283
00:32:47,676 --> 00:32:48,802
you criminals.

284
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:53,765
You're all under arrest.

285
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:56,977
You have the right to remain silent,

286
00:32:57,728 --> 00:32:59,354
and you have the right to an attorney.

287
00:33:49,154 --> 00:33:51,865
What a sight to see.

288
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:53,784
Right?

289
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:55,827
I told you not to drag it out.

290
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,663
Didn't I?

291
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:02,668
You bastards don't deserve
to get out of here alive.

292
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:04,378
Vermin in our society.

293
00:34:04,962 --> 00:34:07,673
Sir, don't worry!

294
00:34:07,756 --> 00:34:10,843
I'll kill them all before I leave.

295
00:34:10,926 --> 00:34:12,845
And I'll find the crypto wallet...

296
00:34:12,928 --> 00:34:15,931
Shut your mouth!

297
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:25,232
I let you live
when I should've killed you,

298
00:34:25,315 --> 00:34:28,026
and look where it fucking got me.

299
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:30,946
Get down!

300
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:36,368
Damn it.

301
00:35:16,617 --> 00:35:19,828
You're all going to die here tonight.

302
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,589
All right. You better go and hide.

303
00:36:13,632 --> 00:36:15,312
Jiyong, go up!

304
00:36:17,261 --> 00:36:18,428
Damn it!

305
00:36:32,693 --> 00:36:33,694
Stop.

306
00:36:41,577 --> 00:36:42,911
President Eom Jaehyub.

307
00:36:42,995 --> 00:36:46,290
You're under arrest
for conspiracy to murder Nam Yeongil

308
00:36:46,373 --> 00:36:48,000
and for colluding with a gang

309
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:50,127
to commit all of your crimes.

310
00:36:51,128 --> 00:36:52,963
What are you talking about?

311
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:58,385
He's the Vigilante. Arrest him.

312
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:00,095
No.

313
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:02,973
Just kill that bastard.

314
00:37:03,724 --> 00:37:05,517
I'll reward you.

315
00:37:06,226 --> 00:37:08,979
I'll give you anything you want,
so kill that bastard.

316
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:11,815
Kim Jiyong!

317
00:37:15,152 --> 00:37:16,153
Jiyong.

318
00:37:17,905 --> 00:37:18,947
Unclench your fists.

319
00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:22,326
This is what you accomplished.

320
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:29,958
- Mr. Jo...
- You don't need to prove it.

321
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:33,170
Because the proposition was a lie.

322
00:37:34,296 --> 00:37:35,923
Choi Miryeo will report on them,

323
00:37:36,673 --> 00:37:38,342
and the world will know about it.

324
00:37:40,177 --> 00:37:41,720
President Eom Jaehyub...

325
00:37:42,554 --> 00:37:44,139
No, the Vole.

326
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:46,391
Let the law punish him.

327
00:37:47,643 --> 00:37:50,812
Jo Heon, kill that bastard. Damn it.

328
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,983
Can't you hear me?

329
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:01,406
I will prove to you

330
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:04,535
that despite its inconsistencies,

331
00:38:05,494 --> 00:38:08,163
the law ultimately does what's right.

332
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,644
How do I get paid
if my financial backer is like this?

333
00:38:31,979 --> 00:38:33,188
Anyway,

334
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:35,774
we should finish what we started.

335
00:39:05,304 --> 00:39:06,305
Eom Jaehyub!

336
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:08,891
What?

337
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,444
Mr. Eom Jaehyub.

338
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:25,616
I'll speak informally to you from now on.

339
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:32,409
I don't need your escort.

340
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:42,586
I said no!

341
00:41:49,885 --> 00:41:51,970
<i>Is everything you said true?</i>

342
00:41:54,556 --> 00:41:55,557
Yes.

343
00:41:57,976 --> 00:42:00,604
The Vigilante was really
a National Police University student?

344
00:42:01,563 --> 00:42:03,941
Min Seonwook?
The student who died at the scene?

345
00:42:06,026 --> 00:42:07,027
Yes.

346
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,782
If you knew this,
then why haven't you reported on it?

347
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:17,079
Because I found out for the first time.

348
00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:19,248
First time...

349
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,292
And not because you were working together?

350
00:42:23,669 --> 00:42:26,505
"I wanted to punish
the bad guys as much as he did."

351
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:29,341
I guess I could say that.

352
00:42:30,175 --> 00:42:31,176
But...

353
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:34,596
isn't that what you want as well?

354
00:42:35,305 --> 00:42:37,224
As well as the people outside, right?

355
00:42:57,286 --> 00:42:59,580
Did you get rid of everything she had?

356
00:43:00,581 --> 00:43:01,582
Yes, sir.

357
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:05,627
She doesn't seem to know
anything more than what she reported on.

358
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:10,382
Everything she said adds up on the whole.

359
00:43:10,966 --> 00:43:14,094
And we didn't need
to try to persuade or scare her.

360
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:19,308
She just seems solely focused
on turning Min Seonwook into a hero.

361
00:43:20,976 --> 00:43:24,771
Well, she's always been a reporter
who's covered that kind of stuff.

362
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:28,775
Just release her.

363
00:43:29,902 --> 00:43:30,903
But...

364
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:36,283
The public image of the police is in ruins
because of Choi Miryeo's report.

365
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:39,494
What she reported on Eom Jaehyub...

366
00:43:39,578 --> 00:43:41,038
Commissioner.

367
00:43:43,707 --> 00:43:44,750
I will...

368
00:43:47,169 --> 00:43:48,879
take care of the rest.

369
00:43:51,006 --> 00:43:53,467
I understand, sir.

370
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:15,739
Motherfucker!

371
00:44:22,955 --> 00:44:23,956
Jiyong.

372
00:44:27,668 --> 00:44:29,503
Mr. Park!

373
00:44:33,507 --> 00:44:35,050
Are you all right, sir?

374
00:44:35,509 --> 00:44:38,303
How did it go? Is everything all right?

375
00:44:38,387 --> 00:44:41,807
Yes, sir. I had Jiyong hospitalized

376
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:44,768
and got rid of footage
from the nearby CCTVs.

377
00:44:45,602 --> 00:44:48,438
The police found some dashcam footage,

378
00:44:48,522 --> 00:44:50,941
but it seems that won't be a problem.

379
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:55,571
But something unexpected has happened.

380
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:57,781
What is it?

381
00:44:57,865 --> 00:44:58,991
Take a look.

382
00:45:00,951 --> 00:45:04,830
<i>Seonwook was a National Police University
student who wanted to become</i>

383
00:45:04,913 --> 00:45:07,791
<i>a compassionate police officer
who served the people.</i>

384
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,419
I think this is Choi Miryeo's work.

385
00:45:10,502 --> 00:45:13,630
<i>I'm well aware there's a lot
of news reports about Seonwook.</i>

386
00:45:14,715 --> 00:45:16,675
<i>Since he was the Vigilante...</i>

387
00:45:16,758 --> 00:45:18,552
<i>I'm sure it's a sensitive issue.</i>

388
00:45:18,635 --> 00:45:20,095
Smart move, Choi Miryeo.

389
00:45:21,763 --> 00:45:25,934
Jiyong and I can start
punishing bad guys right away.

390
00:45:26,018 --> 00:45:27,936
Sir, you should take a break.

391
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,022
Why? The world's filled with bad guys.

392
00:45:30,105 --> 00:45:33,817
It was really difficult to make it
look like you had a car accident.

393
00:45:34,526 --> 00:45:37,779
If this happens again,
the stockholders won't let it slide.

394
00:45:37,863 --> 00:45:39,781
- Your position in the company...
- Fine.

395
00:45:40,616 --> 00:45:42,326
You've had it tough all this time.

396
00:45:42,993 --> 00:45:45,746
I'll restrain myself
for a while. I promise.

397
00:45:48,248 --> 00:45:49,499
I'll let you rest then, sir.

398
00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:51,376
But Mr. Park.

399
00:45:51,835 --> 00:45:52,836
Yes, sir?

400
00:45:54,046 --> 00:45:55,923
The type of evidence we had on Kim Samdoo

401
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,592
wouldn't take down our chairman, right?

402
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:02,179
Once again, the chairman...

403
00:46:06,225 --> 00:46:07,518
will get away with it, right?

404
00:46:09,311 --> 00:46:12,773
I'm sure you'll have
a better chance next time.

405
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:32,751
THE LATE MIN SEONWOOK

406
00:46:32,834 --> 00:46:34,461
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY SENIOR

407
00:46:34,545 --> 00:46:36,255
PRIME MINISTER'S AWARD FOR FUTURE POLICE

408
00:46:43,554 --> 00:46:45,806
<i>Do you think
Jiyong will accept all this?</i>

409
00:46:49,768 --> 00:46:51,854
If it's legal, is it always good?

410
00:46:51,937 --> 00:46:55,357
And if it's illegal, is it always bad?

411
00:46:58,068 --> 00:47:00,404
If I had revealed the truth,

412
00:47:01,697 --> 00:47:05,826
would the law have rooted out great evil?

413
00:47:08,203 --> 00:47:10,038
Or would they have concluded

414
00:47:11,206 --> 00:47:12,749
Jiyong was a heinous criminal...

415
00:47:14,251 --> 00:47:15,627
and Seonwook died in vain?

416
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:20,382
My dad was...

417
00:47:22,176 --> 00:47:23,427
a civil servant.

418
00:47:26,096 --> 00:47:28,974
He killed himself
while being investigated for corruption,

419
00:47:30,267 --> 00:47:31,310
but he was...

420
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:35,606
being framed.

421
00:47:38,692 --> 00:47:40,152
But he was the one

422
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:42,905
who ended up dead.

423
00:47:44,656 --> 00:47:46,074
None of the press

424
00:47:46,533 --> 00:47:49,203
tried to reveal the truth.

425
00:47:51,914 --> 00:47:52,915
So...

426
00:47:55,876 --> 00:47:58,587
I was excited when the Vigilante appeared.

427
00:48:00,422 --> 00:48:05,511
Through him, I wanted
to cause an uproar in the world.

428
00:48:13,101 --> 00:48:15,437
I guess you and I have
something in common now.

429
00:48:21,693 --> 00:48:22,694
Vigilante,

430
00:48:24,112 --> 00:48:25,948
you can't disappear yet.

431
00:49:03,068 --> 00:49:04,778
<i>Reporter Choi Miryeo exposed</i>

432
00:49:04,862 --> 00:49:09,324
<i>the late Chief Eom Jaehyub
as the key figure in "Sewool-gate,"</i>

433
00:49:09,408 --> 00:49:14,913
<i>but it's been revealed he fought
a criminal organization until the end.</i>

434
00:49:14,997 --> 00:49:16,957
<i>And Chief Secretary
Seok Seungcheol announced</i>

435
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,209
<i>the late Eom will be promoted</i>

436
00:49:19,293 --> 00:49:22,546
<i>and appointed posthumously
as honorary Commissioner General.</i>

437
00:49:22,629 --> 00:49:24,339
<i>Here's the press conference.</i>

438
00:49:24,423 --> 00:49:27,176
<i>Unlike what the press
has reported in the news,</i>

439
00:49:27,259 --> 00:49:31,597
<i>the late Eom Jaehyub, who was named
as the key figure in "Sewool-gate,"</i>

440
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:35,184
<i>was in reality an honorable police officer</i>

441
00:49:35,267 --> 00:49:38,270
<i>who fought against a crime organization
until the very end.</i>

442
00:49:39,438 --> 00:49:42,441
<i>He sacrificed his life for justice
but was framed</i>

443
00:49:43,025 --> 00:49:44,735
<i>as a corrupt police officer.</i>

444
00:49:46,486 --> 00:49:47,529
<i>My fellow citizens,</i>

445
00:49:48,697 --> 00:49:51,158
<i>the truth always comes out in the end.</i>

446
00:49:52,993 --> 00:49:56,079
<i>And I believe that will never change,</i>

447
00:49:56,163 --> 00:49:59,082
<i>no matter what kind of society we live in.</i>

448
00:50:01,835 --> 00:50:04,588
Next, our newly appointed
police officers...

449
00:50:06,256 --> 00:50:10,802
will take a solemn oath
to devote themselves

450
00:50:10,886 --> 00:50:13,305
to their country and the citizens.

451
00:50:13,388 --> 00:50:16,225
The President will lead the oath.

452
00:50:21,063 --> 00:50:22,731
Valedictorian, please come forth.

453
00:50:27,736 --> 00:50:29,071
All rise.

454
00:50:30,697 --> 00:50:31,823
I solemnly swear...

455
00:50:32,324 --> 00:50:34,159
- I solemnly swear...
- I solemnly swear...

456
00:50:34,868 --> 00:50:37,037
As a public servant
of the Republic of Korea,

457
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,623
I will uphold
the Constitution and the law,

458
00:50:39,706 --> 00:50:41,458
protect the country,

459
00:50:41,542 --> 00:50:45,045
and faithfully and diligently
serve the people.

460
00:50:45,128 --> 00:50:47,798
I hereby solemnly swear.

461
00:50:47,881 --> 00:50:50,217
March 17th, 2023.

462
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,678
Lieutenant Hwang Jun.

463
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:56,223
Attention!

464
00:50:57,975 --> 00:51:00,644
Salute the President. Present arms!

465
00:51:01,311 --> 00:51:02,563
- Present arms!
- Present arms!

466
00:51:05,107 --> 00:51:06,650
Salute!
