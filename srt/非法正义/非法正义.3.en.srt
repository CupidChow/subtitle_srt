1
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:17,267
ALL CHARACTERS, EVENTS, LOCATIONS
AND INCIDENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,187
God, my head.

3
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:28,486
- Who the fuck drives like that?
- Motherfucker!

4
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,157
If you killed a person
while driving drunk, don't drive again!

5
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,451
How dare you drive drunk again?

6
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:39,998
Come here, you motherfucker!

7
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,546
Get up! Get up, you bastard!

8
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,306
Why did you beat up your girlfriend,
you piece of shit?

9
00:00:56,973 --> 00:01:00,060
What did you say at the trial?
You did it because you loved her?

10
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,479
I love you too, you son of a bitch.

11
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,775
Don't blame us.

12
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,526
We're just doing

13
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,820
what the law failed to do.

14
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,204
Consider it heavenly punishment.

15
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,669
How is this justice?

16
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,631
Why doesn't the law
punish people properly?

17
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:33,051
Why does it neglect the victim
and forgive the perpetrator?

18
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,845
That doesn't mean you can use violence.
Keep quiet.

19
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,973
Why are you doing this to us?

20
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,726
There are tons of real bad guys out there!

21
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,855
<i>Next is news of the vigilante copycat</i>
<i>crimes happening across the country.</i>

22
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:49,234
<i>A total of 18 copycat crimes</i>
<i>have been committed,</i>

23
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:52,112
<i>including five in Busan,</i>

24
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:55,156
<i>four in Gwangju, and two in Daejeon.</i>

25
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,743
<i>Vigilantism is a serious crime</i>
<i>that shakes the rule of law.</i>

26
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:04,332
<i>The Korean judicial system has been turned</i>
<i>into that of the Old West</i>

27
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:07,210
<i>because some of the media</i>
<i>have depicted him as a hero.</i>

28
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,922
<i>Now, I take this opportunity to warn you.</i>

29
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,423
<i>Vigilante.</i>

30
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:15,468
<i>You are no Robin Hood.</i>
<i>You're just a felon.</i>

31
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:20,807
<i>What will you say to the teenagers who</i>
<i>have committed crimes influenced by you?</i>

32
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:25,186
<i>Stop shaking the judicial system</i>
<i>of the Republic of Korea!</i>

33
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,021
<i>All right.</i>

34
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,692
This is crazy. The whole country's
going crazy because of the Vigilante.

35
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,153
Why is that because of the Vigilante?

36
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,738
The bastards using him as an excuse
are the problem.

37
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,407
I told you not to study.

38
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,700
Can't you see?

39
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:42,078
I say the Vigilante knew
it would end up like this.

40
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,913
Or he may have aimed for this all along.

41
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,749
- I doubt he wanted this.
- I agree.

42
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,878
He wasn't the one who incited it.
It was the media.

43
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,506
If only that passion
to protect the judicial system

44
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,593
had been spent on victims,
it wouldn't have come to this.

45
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,223
Kim Jiyong...

46
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,350
You're weird these days.

47
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,437
What do you mean?

48
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:11,900
You and I see eye to eye.

49
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,027
That's weird.

50
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,907
He beat a man to death
in the apartment,

51
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,243
and there are no clues whatsoever?
That's unbelievable.

52
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,163
Did you even investigate?

53
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:28,666
We even went through all the dashcams
of parked cars nearby,

54
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,213
but there was no one
to suspect as the Vigilante.

55
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,131
Any new leads

56
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,300
in the Seo Dooyeop case?

57
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,718
Nothing's changed,

58
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,805
but Seo Dooyeop's accomplices
confessed to other unknown crimes.

59
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,267
But they have nothing to do
with this case.

60
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:50,980
They're more afraid of the Vigilante
than prison.

61
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:52,982
Is that it?

62
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,570
I don't know. I doubt
they are just afraid of the Vigilante.

63
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,827
The whole world is watching now.

64
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:07,538
Right?

65
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:27,767
VIGILANTE

66
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,987
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF
THE DELIVERY DRIVER CASE?

67
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,244
Mr. Han?

68
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,412
Yes?

69
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,749
Did you read the article
on the delivery man on HIT Gallery?

70
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,796
The truck driver was released from prison.
Get an interview.

71
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,924
Let's put it in the preview
and see the reaction.

72
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,178
But I don't think he'll answer my calls.

73
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,264
I know.

74
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,976
Give him a call and get rejected.

75
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,437
Then start covering those around him.

76
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:17,108
Poke all the people
that are involved in his circle. <i>Okay?</i>

77
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:19,944
But these days,

78
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,281
people are sensitive about human rights
and even sue for...

79
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,284
violations, so...

80
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,452
Aren't you a reporter?

81
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,540
Is there anything you can do on your own?

82
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,626
I understand. I'm sorry, ma'am.

I SAY HE DELIBERATELY KILLED
THE DELIVERYMAN

92
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,270
JUST A YEAR AND TWO MONTHS IN PRISON?
IS THE DOJ CRAZY?

93
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:02,690
THERE'S A SAYING IN OUR INDUSTRY.
"IT'S BETTER TO JUST KILL THE VICTIM."

94
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,278
What are you doing here?

95
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:12,158
I couldn't sleep, so I was organizing
the professor's files.

96
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:13,868
What about you?

97
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,746
Me too. I can't sleep.

98
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,086
Why are the lights off?
It's bad for your eyes.

99
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,171
Right.

I really ought to sell this junk.
God damn it.

105
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,456
You...

106
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,920
You damned bastard. How could you be out?

107
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,591
You killed my son!
How could you be out so soon?

108
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,010
God, this woman. Stop it already!

109
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:57,013
I didn't kill him!
It was just an accident!

110
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,806
Then you should've called 911.

111
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,475
Why did you back your truck up?

112
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,352
For fuck's sake!

113
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,608
I finally managed to forget about it.
Why bring it up again?

114
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,445
You're trying to get money out of me,
aren't you?

115
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,238
Threats like this won't work on me.

116
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,866
So get lost! God damn it!

117
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,493
Have you heard of
the Double Jeopardy Clause?

118
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,121
It means I'm innocent now.

119
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,999
It's over because I received
my punishment!

120
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,417
Don't you understand?

121
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,170

-Yes.

If my son ever does something bad,

133
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,451
just throw him in jail.

134
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,202

135
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,831

They weren't, but it seems he used
some kind of jamming device

00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:06,989
I swear, I didn't kill my husband
for the insurance money.

176
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,073
Right.

177
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,328
Resent the law that freed you.

178
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,291
<i>Second,</i>

179
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:21,629
<i>Choi, a minor who ruthlessly</i>
<i>raped a woman.</i>

180
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,213
You remember her, right?

181
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:24,924
No...

182
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,968
The other guys told me to follow them.

183
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,221
I had no choice.

184
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,015
So you raped her?

185
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,943
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF COPYCAT CRIMES

186
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,527
"...imitate the one they admire

187
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,988
and they are likely
to be people around you."

188
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,242
Hey! You won't believe it!

189
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:55,162
The Vigilante sent a message
to the broadcasting station!

190
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,831
Come on! Hurry up!

191
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:58,958
He's so frustrating!

192
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,218
<i>After the last punishment,</i>

193
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:13,681
Unmasking The Case 24:00
<i>received a message.</i>

194
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,726
<i>"Even if I left a message at the scene,</i>
<i>the police wouldn't show it."</i>

195
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,395
<i>"So I'm sending it to the media."</i>

196
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:23,065
<i>We will reveal</i>
<i>the Vigilante's message right now.</i>

197
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,149
<i>Everyone.</i>

198
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,945
<i>Vigilantism is a crime.</i>

199
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,949
<i>It shakes the foundations</i>
<i>of the rule of law,</i>

200
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,119
<i>and it is a terrible crime in itself.</i>

201
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,708
<i>However, this is a matter of empathy.</i>

202
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,086
<i>I declare publicly.</i>

203
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,338
<i>I will not stop my vigilante activities.</i>

204
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,008
<i>It's not that I'm unaware it's a crime.</i>

205
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:53,178
<i>Human beings have felt bad for others'</i>
<i>misfortunes even before the law existed.</i>

206
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,931
<i>And I just follow the human instinct</i>
<i>to hate sin.</i>

207
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:59,476
<i>No one will be able to catch us.</i>

208
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,772
<i>When laws that prioritize victims' rights</i>
<i>over perpetrators' are made and enforced!</i>

209
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,067
<i>When the law wipes away</i>
<i>the victims' tears!</i>

210
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,946
<i>Only then will the evil spirit</i>
<i>called "Vigilante" lose its meaning</i>

211
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,574
<i>and disappear into the morning sun.</i>

212
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,710
That was insane.

213
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,382
He's basically saying,
"Catch me if you can."

214
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,886
Challenging the whole nation so boldly.

215
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,972
And all while killing criminals?

216
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,268
He's stark raving mad.

217
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,728
This wasn't the Vigilante.

218
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,689
-How do you know that?
-What?

219
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,403
He said "us." "Us."

220
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,537
Does this mean it's organized crime?

221
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:05,751
Or he's pretending it is
to cause confusion in our investigation.

222
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:06,835
No.

223
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:11,048
The guy who killed the three people
this time is not the Vigilante.

224
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,052
What makes you think so?

225
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,223
Their M.O. is exactly the same.

226
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:23,352
I hope it's not
some detective's hunch or intuition.

227
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:28,065
Just look. A minor and a woman.

228
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,567
The target pattern is
completely different.

229
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,530
That's an interesting point of view,

230
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,866
but there is no clear basis.

231
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,495
Do you want to hear what I think?

232
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,957
Overpowering his opponent

233
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,709
brings him great pleasure.

234
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,796
If the police fail to catch him,

235
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,881
no matter how many times he does it,

236
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,926
he starts to feel invincible.

237
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:57,845
In addition,

238
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,806
if people applaud

239
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,935
his crimes,

240
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,772
he crosses the line even further.

241
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,483
As you can see,

242
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,653
a woman

243
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,780
and a minor.

244
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,867
He gets out of control.

245
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,912
You think so? I don't see it that way.

246
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,293
The message may sound like

247
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:34,047
he's emphasizing the justification
of the Vigilante's activities,

248
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:39,469
but it's actually a message
that is provoking someone.

249
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,559
There is only one person a copycat...

250
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,312
would provoke.

251
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:51,982
APPROVAL PLEASE

252
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,066
What now?

253
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,361
It's bad enough we lost
to the copycat show,

254
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,989
but we even lost
the message from the Vigilante?

255
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,700
That wasn't the Vigilante.

256
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,786
Stop acting like you know everything!

257
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,831
What are we going to do?
The director's furious!

258
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,458
He wants us to cancel the show!

259
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,043
-Mr. Kwak.
-What?

260
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,463
This week's <i>REPO25h.</i>
Let's have a special debate.

261
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:20,636
What's the point of that?

262
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,725
We'll become the real messengers.

263
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:31,605
The only messenger that conveys
the wishes of the Vigilante.

264
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,150
I'll do it myself.

265
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,572
Hey... You got something big, right?

266
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,549
-Are you going somewhere?
-Yes.

267
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,136
I left something in the professor's room.

268
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,471
I'll be right back.

269
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,940
<i>Did you read the article yesterday?</i>

270
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:01,945
<i>A vice-chairman of a company announced</i>
<i>that he would hire young men</i>

271
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,824
<i>who have been convicted of crimes</i>
<i>for working as vigilantes.</i>

272
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,243
We must stop this madness.

273
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:14,916
This all started when criminals' faces
and identities were revealed.

274
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,168
REPO25H
SPECIAL DEBATE

275
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:21,131
Of course, I deeply sympathize
with the public's anger.

276
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:24,134
However, the families of the criminals
are also suffering

277
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,054
from being judged
as guilty by association.

278
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:33,643
We need to understand that we must protect
their human rights without belittling them

279
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,563
in order to become
a truly advanced country.

280
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:40,734
Now, what do you think,
Reporter Choi Miryeo?

281
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:45,155
I'm sure you have a lot to say
as the first person

282
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,615
to use the term, "vigilante."

283
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:51,119
I completely agree with what you said
and support your view, Mr. Cho.

284
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:55,165
However, now that we have considered
the human rights of criminals,

285
00:22:55,749 --> 00:23:00,128
why don't we think about protecting
those of victims and good people?

286
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,924
<i>You mentioned guilt by association.</i>

287
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,761
<i>But does it only apply to criminals?</i>

288
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:14,267
<i>The crime does not simply end</i>
<i>with the damage to the victim.</i>

289
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:19,189
<i>It also causes huge damage</i>
<i>to the victim's family.</i>

290
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,402
<i>Especially for children</i>
<i>who lose their guardians.</i>

291
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,487
<i>It completely changes</i>

292
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,656
<i>or ruins their lives.</i>

293
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,326
That's what's truly unfair.

294
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:36,998
What's more, secondary damage
awaits the victims and their families.

295
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,210
The court's soft punishment.

296
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:45,340
The Juvenile Act, temporary insanity,
and accidental crimes.

297
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,845
I'm not saying we should trample
on criminal's human rights.

298
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:54,015
<i>The media or the Vigilante</i>
<i>isn't the problem.</i>

299
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,476
You just blame this

300
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:02,607
on people's lack of law-abiding spirit
and civic consciousness.

301
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,277
Assemblymen's dereliction of duty!

302
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,240
<i>Don't you think that's</i>
<i>what's created the Vigilante?</i>

303
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,161
Choi Miryeo...

304
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,172
You bastard! Stop.

305
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,051
Get that bastard!

306
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:31,595
Hey!

307
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,688
All right. Let me see your face.

308
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,365
Captain,

309
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,869
can you investigate that guy?

310
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,205
You won't do it yourself?

311
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,666
He isn't the vigilante I'm looking for.

312
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,795
What... How do you know?

313
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,383
He wouldn't be making that face
when caught.

314
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:15,972
Hey, take him.

315
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,856
Get out of the way!

316
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,570
God damn it. Fucking move, you old hag!

317
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,950
Why the fuck do you
keep blocking the way? Move!

318
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,453
- Oh, no.
- For fuck's sake.

319
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,248
God damn it.
Get the fuck out of the way!

320
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,208
Are you laughing?

321
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:46,294
Those boxes aren't important right now.
Get out of my way!

322
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,088
Fuck!

323
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,930
For fuck's sake!

324
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,104
Aren't the boxes worth
fucking chump change?

325
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,855
Am I a joke to you?

326
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,816
You think I'm less than these boxes?

327
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,527
I ought to... You're fucking
pissing me off.

328
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,529
Ma'am.

329
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,825
What have you done?
What do you think you're doing?

330
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,202
Fuck off if you don't want to die.

331
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,415
You shit! You little...

332
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,471
That bastard pushed me first.

333
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,474
Why are you only taking me?
This is so unfair.

334
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:45,061
Damn it. Look at my face!

335
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:56,823
The perpetrator's face is a mess.

336
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,283
Did you hit him?

337
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:02,412
Well, yes. He attacked me first,
so I hit back.

338
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:05,540
Still, you shouldn't have
beaten him like that.

339
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,666
Excuse me?

340
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,835
He says he's going to sue you.

341
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,838
You have to come with us
to the police station.

342
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,841
That makes no sense.

343
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,676
-Sue me?
-Let's talk at the station.

344
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,761
-But...
-Let's go.

345
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,429
Why should I? Wait.

346
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,681
I feel for you,
but that's just how the law is.

347
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:22,766
What...

348
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,184
-Darn it.
-Get in.

349
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,519
What kind of law is this?

350
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:29,105
Sir, this is unfair.

351
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,358
<i>It has happened again.</i>

352
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:35,278
<i>An old woman who lived hand to mouth</i>
<i>while caring for her sick husband.</i>

353
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:39,574
<i>A man mercilessly hit and killed</i>
<i>the old woman for no reason,</i>

354
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:43,078
<i>and after he was arrested,</i>
<i>he claimed temporary insanity</i>

355
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,455
<i>and that it was an unintentional mistake.</i>

356
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:49,209
<i>The man, who ruthlessly killed</i>
<i>an old woman collecting cardboard boxes</i>

357
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:53,171
<i>for getting in the way of his car,</i>

358
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:57,050
<i>sued the person who subdued</i>
<i>him for assault. For the treatment...</i>

359
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,302
The man who helped her
is being held at the station,

360
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,180
and the asshole who killed her
is getting treated at the hospital?

361
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:08,728
God damn it. What kind of country is this?

362
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,856
Tell me about it.
This isn't right.

363
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,823
Come on.

364
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,492
It can be practice for the field.

365
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:08,455
To improve our hunch, sense, and insight.
There's so much to learn.

366
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,956
You're really not going?

367
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,249
I can't today.

368
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,377
I wasn't going to say this, but...

369
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,505
It's one of Asia's biggest clubs.

370
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,008
Tonight's on me.

371
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,593
Let's go next time.

372
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:24,721
You said you'd go. How could you
go back on your word?

373
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,473
Forget it. I'll go with Jiyong.

374
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:27,724
Jiyong, do you want...

375
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,560
No. Never mind.

376
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,437
I'll look ugly if I go with you.

377
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,482
You guys just go home.

378
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:38,401
I'm going to go by myself.
Don't regret it later.

379
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,703
Come on, let's settle!

380
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,749
Do you really want to ruin
my brother's life?

381
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:57,212
I'll give you 20 million won,
so please come out.

382
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:58,880
Please!

383
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:01,883
I'm not asking you to settle for free.

384
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,302
I'll give you money!

385
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,804
Money!

386
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,980
Don't be so stubborn.

387
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:20,235
I'm leaving my business card,
so please give me a call.

388
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,905
This is a lot of money for a grandma.

389
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,365
Okay?

390
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:33,957
Hey.

391
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,435
Who are you?

392
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,108
You bastard...

393
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,113
Attention, everyone!

394
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:10,660
Jang Soondo, who assaulted and killed
an elderly woman a few days ago.

395
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,620
You know he's being
hospitalized today, right?

396
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,455
-Yes.
-From now on,

397
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,791
we are monitoring the hospital closely.

398
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,668
The points marked here.

399
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:21,504
Reporter Han and Producer Kwon, <i>team A.</i>

400
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:25,216
<i>Team B. Team C.</i>

401
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,135
And <i>team D.</i>

402
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,889
Please film with the action cam, 24 hours.

403
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,432
<i>-Okay?</i>
-Yes, ma'am.

404
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:36,311
Aren't we too focused on the hospital?
What if the Vigilante doesn't go there?

405
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,814
We aren't just trying
to film the Vigilante.

406
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,358
We're trying to film

407
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:45,278
the Vigilante moving
after he watches our broadcast.

408
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,696
Do you get the difference?

409
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:53,453
I know. I'm just worried he might not come
because of the police.

410
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:54,537
All right, let's go!

411
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,206
-Yes, ma'am.
-Let's go. Let's go.

412
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,000
Let's go!

413
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,376
BOHYE MEDICAL CENTER

414
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,505
Turn off the lights. I want to sleep.

415
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,799
Be quiet.
Don't even think about running away.

416
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:11,930
What do you mean, run away?
I just want to sleep.

417
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,515
-Yes. The hospital Jang Soondo's in.
-Hey, call them.

418
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,767
There's no number here.

419
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,186
Since he's a good target.

420
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:19,687
Hey, then...

421
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:23,566
-Yes. Sure, I'll give you a call.
-Check the number plate.

422
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,414
Park the car and come up.

423
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,605
Hello?

424
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,191
Yes, that's right.

425
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,569
Yes.

426
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,908
How could you hit a parked car?

427
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,411
I'm coming down now.

428
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,872
God damn it.

429
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:48,776
The one who breaks the law better
than anyone else is being protected by it.

430
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,779
The one who obeyed the law
better than anyone else

431
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,532
wasn't protected in any way.

432
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,785
So I thought about it.

433
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:03,207
I think some crimes
can be punished by crimes.

434
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,253
Are you looking for leniency?

435
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,715
Go tell the judge.

436
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:14,594
That you deeply regret it
and want the maximum sentence.

437
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,638
If you don't and get released,
you'll meet me again.

438
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:22,018
Then you'll suffer much more pain
than the old lady.

439
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,771
I'll make sure of it.

440
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:28,524
So discuss it with your brother
and figure out

441
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,109
what you should do.

442
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,408
Where are you going?

443
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:38,951
Someone said they hit my car.

444
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:49,837
I guess not.

445
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,217
Let's go!

446
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,804
All of them are going up.

447
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,124
Help.

448
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:29,127
Hello? Anybody out there?

449
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,045
Please!

450
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,089
-Hurry up!
-Help. Here!

451
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,173
It's here.

452
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,800
It's here.

453
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,093
What is it? What happened?

454
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,637
I'm being threatened.

455
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,222
Did you see the face? Who was it?

456
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,598
I... So...

457
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,809
No. It was too dark to see his face.

458
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:45,893
Man...

459
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:48,771
I have to call my brother right now.

460
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,984
A man in a doctor's gown.
Tall, in his mid-20s.

461
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,027
-Captain, you check the CCTVs.
-Okay.

462
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,989
Detective Woo and Cho,
search all the rooms and bathrooms.

463
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,699
Officer Kim, to the parking lot!

464
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,868
-Hurry up.
-Let's move.

465
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,932
What the fuck!

466
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,528
Everyone, focus.

467
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,155
Yes, ma'am.

468
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,789
-Found anything?
-Nothing, sir.

469
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,230
Soonil?

470
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,904
He's like a quote generator.

471
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,573
How can I not fall for him?

472
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,701
He's right.

473
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:10,788
Crimes should be punished by crimes.

474
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,734
God damn it...

475
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,409
- I'll leave it to you.
- Okay.

476
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:49,785
Let's secure the scene.

477
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,040
Hey, this is Inspector Park.

478
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,250
-Please, leave.
-We need backup.

479
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,475
Shit! You scared me!

480
00:39:58,646 --> 00:39:59,647
Who are you?

481
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,319
What's the rush? Not even a "hello"?

482
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,405
Hold on. Let me catch my breath.

483
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,577
Nice to meet you, Jiyong.
