Yes. He saved me.

Could you tell me what's going on?

382
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:35,223
I was walking at night,
and drunk guys started to harass me.

383
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:39,144
It could've gone bad,
but he came and helped me.

384
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:43,273
We haven't found the harassers yet,
so we came to get a statement from him.

547
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,783
All right. Please leave.

548
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,869
I'll call you if something comes up.

549
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,965
Do you think Yeon Jaehak left it at home?

550
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,927
I'm sure he knew it was dangerous.

551
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,970
EUNHYUN POLICE STATION

552
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,267
Any idea where it might be?

553
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,774
The place we were supposed to meet at.

554
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,609
Jaehak suddenly changed the location.

555
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,569
Where is it?

556
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,582
LET'S MEET

557
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,417
I'M SCARED. ARE YOU GOING TO HIT ME AGAIN?

558
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,878
I'LL CONTACT YOU NEAR THE BUS TERMINAL
TOMORROW AT 9

559
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,839
I'LL DECIDE THEN WHETHER TO MEET YOU

560
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,345
(SIGHS)

561
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:55,153
Don't you just love this fresh air?

562
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,237
You're all talk.

563
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,990
Cut it out.

564
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:01,617
Beer?

565
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,745
Hey, I'm a busy man,
but that sounds great. (LAUGHS)

566
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,455
-What about you?
-I'm busy.

567
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,082
Why bother? Of course, he can't.

568
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,709
Hold on. This bastard.

569
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,669
He's acting weird these days.

570
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,629
-What?
-You have secrets, don't you?

571
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:14,714
Be honest.

572
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,257
GIRL: Hey.

573
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,386
Hello.

574
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,849
Do you remember me?

575
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,228
Oh, yes.

576
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:33,191
I don't know the details,
but I think I helped you last time.

577
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,234
Shouldn't you treat me to a meal?

578
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,570
I actually wanted to meet you.

579
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,489
This is great. Let's go.

580
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,326
-Bye.
-Bye.

581
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,999
That traitor bastard.

582
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:51,918
That cool bastard.

583
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,714
I think we're around the same age.

584
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:59,383
Isn't it strange for us to speak formally?

585
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,676
Let's talk casually.

586
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:05,056
-Sure. What do you want to eat?
<i>-Sundae gukbap.</i>

587
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,808
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

588
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,066
-I'm going to hit the restroom.
-Okay.

589
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,247
May I help you?

590
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,167
I'm Jo Heon, team leader
of the regional investigation unit.

591
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,628
I'm investigating the Vigilante.

592
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:38,839
So?

593
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,466
About four years ago,

594
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:46,180
Professor Lee Junyeop and I were
dispatched to South America together.

595
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:50,017
If you think about it,
you're like my junior officer.

596
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:55,064
So may I speak informally to you
from now on?

597
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,360
Sure, sir.

598
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:02,989
You've seen me before, right?

599
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,449
Yes. I saw you
when you visited the school.

600
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,326
Since you're a cop,

601
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,997
you must be interested
in the Vigilante case?

602
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,917
Of course. I watch the news
and everything about it.

603
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,878
It's also related to the report
I'm writing now.

604
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:23,134
Then how do you think
the Vigilante would...

605
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,471
write a report...

606
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,599
on the Vigilante?

607
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:37,940
(CHUCKLES)

608
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,236
Well...

609
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,658
I think he'd write it objectively...

610
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:54,248
without sounding antisocial.

611
00:38:54,749 --> 00:39:00,087
Why? To hide the fact
that he's the Vigilante?

612
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,672
No.

613
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:05,051
Because the Vigilante wouldn't think

614
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,469
he's committing crimes.

615
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,598
That's interesting.

616
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,225
It is.

617
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,562
Yes, that's right.

618
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,815
That's the peculiarity of the Vigilante's

619
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,400
crimes.

620
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:27,740
So I'm focusing on eradicating the crimes

621
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:32,661
rather than catching the Vigilante.

622
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:42,254
The Vigilante will be caught soon.

623
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,215
So...

624
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:46,967
don't do it again.

625
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:49,678
I'm advising you.

626
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,766
Your talents would go to waste.

627
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,727
I mean it.

628
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:03,109
I don't know
what you're talking about, sir.

629
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,195
Jiyong.

630
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,279
Yes.

631
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,201
JUNYEOP: <i>I'm not sure.</i>

632
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,412
<i>What would you do?</i>

633
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:18,040
If the Vigilante is caught

634
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,337
and it turns out
he's a steady and righteous person

635
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:28,717
with a good job and a good reputation,

636
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:31,971
and if...

637
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,933
he's even young and good-looking,

638
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,854
<i>the public will go wild.</i>

639
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,481
<i>Beyond our control.</i>

640
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:46,694
<i>Maybe that's why...</i>

641
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,074
he isn't trying to hide his crimes...

642
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,619
but rather flaunt them.

643
00:40:58,998 --> 00:40:59,999
So?

644
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,502
We'll create a list of candidates
for the Vigilante.

645
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,756
Pick the worst of them...

646
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,885
and frame him for all the crimes.

647
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,096
"Look."

648
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:19,226
"The Vigilante you were so wild about
is worthless."

649
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,103
"He's a loser."

650
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:24,690
That is...

651
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:30,029
<i>the best way to put vigilantism...</i>

652
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,701
to rest.

653
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,337
