1
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:17,017
ALL CHARACTERS, EVENTS, LOCATIONS
AND INCIDENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:24,899
Traitor Kim Jiyong.

3
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,697
Die.

4
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,826
Let's kill the Vigilante

5
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,078
and bury him here.

6
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,873
And then, become a police officer.

7
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,667
Join the force,

8
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,420
and let's work together.

9
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,339
Hey.

10
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,051
Sir.

11
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:55,764
Is this also...

12
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,769
what the Vole, Eom Jaehyub,
ordered you to do?

13
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,666
I don't care...

14
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:29,547
whether you arrest me or kill me.

15
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:33,927
I don't care what the world calls me!

16
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,721
Because this is my calling.

17
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:40,934
The calling that's perfect for me,
because I have nothing to lose!

18
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,685
It's to become a devil

19
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,814
to kill other devils.

20
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:50,318
I'm sure you already know
what Chairman Kim and the Vole are up to.

21
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:55,031
Don't just talk about it and show me

22
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:59,828
that the law won't let them have their way

23
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,704
and will punish them!

24
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,917
Show me your justice really exists!

25
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,170
If you show me,

26
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,507
I will follow you.

27
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,844
Or I will prove it to you instead!

28
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:22,433
Illegal activities
can destroy great evils.

29
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:39,659
VIGILANTE

30
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,212
Just as I said,

31
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,132
finish the handover by this week.

32
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,342
Was it your decision?

33
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,012
I've done my best to stop it.

34
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,598
While you wait reassignment,

35
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,559
I'll subsidize the wages
taken out for educational expenses,

36
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,311
so clear your head as you rest.

37
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,605
Is it because of Sewool?

38
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,947
Do you believe the conspiracy theory
on the news too?

39
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,491
I'll be also transferred next week.

40
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:25,121
So step down as team leader
as soon as you complete the handover.

41
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:26,748
Understood?

42
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,214
Understood, sir.

43
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,342
Dismissed.

44
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,128
That fucking son of a bitch, I'll...

45
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,466
Sir! Hello, boss.

46
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,719
Remember who ordered you
to kidnap Choi now?

47
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,888
Pardon?

48
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,057
I already told you I don't know that...

49
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,064
Is the Vole involved or not?

50
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,151
I just move when Mr. Bang tells me to,

51
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:40,363
so I really don't know that much. I swear.

52
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,495
Where is Mr. Bang?

53
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,749
The Squeezer...

54
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:56,671
The brainless fat bald bastard
that I told you about the other day.

55
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:00,883
I think he knows where Mr. Bang is.
The Squeezer.

56
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,220
<i>Jiyong.</i>

57
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,266
You're the real deal.

58
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,311
I was right after all.

59
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,317
I heard you talk
with that bastard Jo Heon.

60
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,527
He may be huge,

61
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,406
but you crushed him
both logically and morally.

62
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,824
So if he ever

63
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,036
tries to stop us again...

64
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,458
then I'll step in.

65
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,461
I'll kill him.

66
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,962
So chin up, Jiyong.

67
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,173
You have me.

68
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,932
I almost forgot the most important thing!

69
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,732
The perfect timing.

70
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:04,906
And a solo shot.

71
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,514
<i>Hello, everyone. This is</i> REPO25h.

HELP CHOI MIRYEO KEEP REPORTING

82
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,068
Good work, everyone.
Why don't you go take a break?

83
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:25,945
Come on.

84
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,572
-Let's go.
-All right.

85
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,575
Goodness. What do you think?

86
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:32,952
Do you like it?

87
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,748
Supporting me with all this...

88
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,042
Thank you so much.

89
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,253
No, I should thank you.

90
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,006
I was worried you might refuse my offer.

91
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:48,176
But since you trusted me
and accepted it, I'm so glad.

92
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,805
What's your relationship with Kim Samdoo?

93
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:54,891
Well...

94
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:59,061
If I supported Chairman Kim
who supports vigilante activities,

95
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,855
I thought I'd get something in return.

96
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,650
I really want to find the Vigilante.

97
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,697
Now that you have your office,

98
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,699
what's your plan?

99
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:19,207
I'll expose in earnest
what Chairman Kim has done.

100
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,668
So that the government agencies
can't help but investigate.

101
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,466
-And after that?
-And...

102
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,931
when the investigation
slows down and starts to fizzle,

103
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,017
I'll set the stage for the Vigilante.

104
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:43,606
So the public will get
the most satisfaction.

105
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,278
I guess you've realized...

106
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,159
that we're on the same side.

107
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,750
Hello, everyone.

108
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,754
I'm Choi Miryeo,
former reporter for <i>REPO25h.</i>

109
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:12,301
The slogan of <i>V News</i>
is "Boldly and truthfully,"

110
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,888
and we promise to report
the news boldly and truthfully.

111
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:19,141
<i>And this may sound like a joke,</i>

112
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:23,771
<i>but while investigating for news,</i>
<i>I will never commit suicide.</i>

113
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:28,401
<i>If I die, I guarantee</i>
<i>I will have been murdered.</i>

114
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:33,656
<i>Even though no one's come forward yet</i>
<i>and I don't know how I'll end up,</i>

115
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:39,537
<i>I believe it's the media's true duty</i>
<i>to reveal the truth.</i>

116
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,624
<i>I believe that those</i>
<i>who believe in justice will join me.</i>

117
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:48,921
<i>And I believe that all of us</i>
<i>fighting for justice are vigilantes.</i>

118
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:52,133
One thing became clear
while I was covering the news.

119
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,427
<i>The man we call the Vigilante</i>

120
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,638
<i>is already fighting against them.</i>

121
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,558
<i>Maybe it's going to be a long fight.</i>

122
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:05,021
<i>But if you join and support us,</i>
<i>it'll be a great help.</i>

123
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:09,400
<i>We will go all the way. Thank you.</i>

Come here!

-Hey.
-Yes?

00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,453
Kill him.

136
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,165
Kill? Kill who?

137
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,042
I'm giving you a chance.

Look, pig.

142
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,767
It seems you're trying to scare me.

But I'm the Wasp.
I'm not going to fall for that.

I'll make it quick, okay?

147
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,819
Stay away, you crazy bastard!

148
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,529
Stay still, you fucker!

-Hey.
-Yes?

00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,088
Are you kidding me?

154
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,298
You can't kill a person who's tied up?

155
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,467
Give me five seconds. I'll get it done.

156
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,219
I'll do better than him, sir.

157
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,596
-No, sir! I'm better!
-No, he's not!

158
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,474
You saw it. I'm tied up,
but this bastard couldn't do anything!

159
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,559
He's brainless.

160
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,936
-Shut up, you fucking moron!
-You're the fucking moron!

-Shut up! No, you are!

00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,409
This is absurd.

166
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,954
It's been a while
since the Vigilante appeared.

167
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,542
But he's arrested only petty criminals,
and there are no leads.

168
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:36,422
And when he announced
we arrested the Vigilante, it was a lie.

169
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,348
And he's not even here for the handover?

170
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,902
This team's disbanded as of today.

171
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,614
Go back to your original teams.

172
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,367
You can stop calling
the former team leader.

173
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,495
I'll find the files on my own.

174
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,173
Guys, let's go get something to eat.

175
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,426
-Okay.
-Let's go and work.

178
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,440
"Nine billion won to Miteum Church."

179
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,069
MITEUM CHURCH

180
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,738
{\an8}MITEUM CHURCH, CHAIRMAN KIM SAMDOO
AT SOUP KITCHEN EVENT

181
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,211
Yes, Pastor.

182
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,797
I already got a call.

183
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,800
I understand.

184
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,928
I've converted all the money into QQ Coin.

185
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,806
I'll get rid of all the records today.

186
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:37,478
CURRENCY EXCHANGE BETWEEN FOREIGN ACCOUNTS

187
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,690
{\an8}SEWOOL FUTURE RESOURCES, MITEUM CHURCH

188
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,537
RESTRICTED AREA

189
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,043
Why did you run?

190
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,714
Because it's thrilling.

191
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,345
Jiyong, just accept me already.

192
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,849
If we join forces,
we can achieve many more things.

193
00:16:56,932 --> 00:17:00,019
As you asked, I got an office for Choi
and a cloned phone for you.

194
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:05,232
Haven't you been waiting
for someone like me to appear?

195
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:09,987
I have.

196
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,156
Really?

197
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,326
Yes! I knew I'd get through
to you eventually.

198
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,620
You know we have a lot in common, right?

199
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,705
Take your mask off.

200
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,541
Right now?

201
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:26,211
I need proof
you're not doing this just for fun.

202
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,298
If you can't take on the responsibility,

203
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,633
I can't work with you.

204
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:35,971
You just said...

205
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,644
you'd work with me.

206
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,403
Miteum Church's Pastor Shin

207
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,781
is collecting Kim Samdoo
and Eom Jaehyub's money.

208
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:59,036
He's laundering and managing
their money for them.

209
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,997
Once I take care of Pastor Shin,

210
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,457
have Choi Miryeo expose this.

211
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,795
You're not connecting it with Sewool?

212
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,799
All the cases connected with Sewool so far

213
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,260
were either briefly covered once
or never covered.

214
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:19,139
That's true. We should just kill them.

215
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,393
If I kill the pastor,
it'll be on the news.

216
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,313
It'll draw the media's attention,

217
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,525
and the religious community
will make a fuss.

218
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,863
If we expose this then,
they'll have to cover it.

219
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,826
Everyone in the media
will be talking about it,

220
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,328
and the public will be enraged.

221
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,580
That sounds great.

222
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,669
But the investigation will drag on,

223
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,755
and they'll be acquitted.

224
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,840
Why?

225
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,968
Because the money...

226
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,471
is for powerful politicians.

227
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,766
Do you have evidence?

228
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,398
No.

229
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,692
You got some balls.

230
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,611
When the investigation fizzles out

231
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,282
and the public is
on the verge of giving up,

232
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:23,328
that's when I'll hit Kim Samdoo
and expose the evidence.

233
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,498
The evidence on him is decisive.

234
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,214
You know what you just said

235
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,800
sounds really unrealistic, right?

236
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,261
You say you'll get Kim Samdoo,

237
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,306
but it's more likely
that you'll die first.

238
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,433
What do you think?

239
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,979
That's not a bad ending.

240
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,528
A man dying after beating
his head against a wall.

241
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,115
That's interesting, too.

242
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,454
Have it done as I said.

243
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,416
By the way, Jiyong,

244
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,085
we're on the same side now.

245
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,882
So will you save my name
as something cool on your phone?

246
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,469
Dream on. I'll never do that.

247
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:28,685
That punk... Playing hard to get.

248
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,774
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

249
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,484
Hey.

250
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,321
Hi.

251
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,615
-Hey, how are you?
-Fine, sir.

252
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,343
Hello.

253
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,805
You remember me, right?

254
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,683
I'm Nam Yeongil.

255
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,061
I'm the new leader
of the RIU for the Vigilante case.

256
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,066
I didn't touch anything.

257
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,279
I guess I forgot to lock the door.

258
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:25,909
So what brings you here?

259
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:32,082
While investigating the case,
I found that Jo Heon visited you here.

260
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:33,875
He did.

261
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,336
What did you talk about?

262
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,092
I'd written about the recent cases,

263
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,886
and he came for my advice
after reading it.

264
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,722
Could you tell me in detail?

265
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,183
You should ask him yourself.

266
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,477
Yes?

267
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,607
I'm sorry, sir. I'll come back later.

268
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:58,817
No.

269
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,487
I showed up unannounced,
so I'll wait outside.

270
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,531
No, it's okay.

271
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,451
You must be busy,
so I'll talk with you first.

272
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,995
Can you wait there for a minute?

273
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,079
Sure.

274
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,248
Please.

275
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,501
Then I'll ask you just one thing.

276
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,755
Did Jo Heon ask you

277
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:23,091
to show him the students' pictures?

278
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,555
Yes.

279
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,809
And I didn't show him,
since it wasn't an official request.

280
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:34,644
Will that be all?

281
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,695
Thank you for your cooperation.

282
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,615
I'll call you if I have more questions.

283
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:12,474
How are you feeling?

284
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:14,935
I'm feeling fine.

285
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,646
I was just a little startled.
I wasn't hurt much.

286
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,108
But still, you don't have to
help me for a while,

287
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:24,903
so get some rest, recover,
and catch up with your studies.

288
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:25,987
No, sir.

289
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,824
I want to help out
until you complete the app.

290
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:29,950
No.

291
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,035
There's no need.

292
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,453
Thanks for your help.

293
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,706
You may leave.

294
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,219
Attention!

295
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:51,847
Salute the president!

296
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,098
-Present arms!
-Present arms!

297
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,226
Present arms!

298
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:58,728
Present arms.

299
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:01,773
At ease.

300
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:06,903
Above all else, a police officer
must be honest and upright.

301
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:10,198
You should not desire
to unlawfully obtain money or benefits.

302
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,617
You should always focus your mindset...

303
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,662
He hasn't been cleared of suspicion yet.
How could he say that?

304
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,205
...with honorable morality...

305
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,373
I know, right?

306
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:23,336
That dignity and pride should be
our strongest competitive factors.

307
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,006
"On the Lord's glorious path."

308
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,592
<i>On Lord's glorious path</i>

309
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:32,012
"I will stand up and run."

310
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,598
<i>I will stand up...</i>

311
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,933
You dimwit. Why didn't you tell me sooner?

312
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:40,312
The guy who knocked me out
didn't touch anything else.

313
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:46,443
He said to get rid of all the records,
so I thought it'd be okay not to tell.

314
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:50,238
Then, you should've stuck to that.
What do you want me to do?

315
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,656
It's been bothering me.

316
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,326
Should I tell him now?

317
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,203
Or should I just say I burned it?

318
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,417
-It's been a while.
-Nice seeing you.

319
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,752
-It's been a while.
-Thank you.

320
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:04,836
-Take care.
-You too.

321
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,468
Did you have a good service, Pastor?

322
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,762
I had a hard time crying.

323
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,098
How about the records?

324
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,559
Well, they are...

325
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,479
I got rid of them as you said.

326
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:23,855
Good job.

327
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:27,150
Here the phones with the crypto wallets.

328
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:34,282
What was the chairman so worried about?

329
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,408
It's so inconvenient.

330
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,537
He must lack faith.

331
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:43,750
Who are you?

332
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,296
You bastard, how dare you come here again?

333
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,177
You little...

334
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,499
I'm a pastor. How dare you...

335
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,251
Aren't you afraid of God?

336
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:27,877
God?

337
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,380
Did God

338
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:34,134
teach you to sell drugs

339
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,428
and act as loan sharks

340
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,389
with thugs?

341
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,517
What is it that you want?

342
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,479
An uprising.

343
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,898
I want all the weak in the world

344
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,444
to see the dismal end of a criminal

345
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,780
and rise in rebellion

346
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,284
to protect themselves.

347
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,217
{\an8}<i>Around 10:00 p.m. yesterday,</i>
<i>Pastor Shin Jongun</i>

348
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,137
{\an8}<i>was found dead</i>
<i>in the main chapel of Miteum Church.</i>

349
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,931
<i>Judging from the writing on the wall</i>
<i>and the methods used,</i>

350
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,768
<i>the police tentatively concluded</i>
<i>that it was the Vigilante</i>

351
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,269
<i>and launched an investigation.</i>

352
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:31,149
{\an8}<i>With the death of Pastor Shin,</i>
<i>who was revered for helping those in need,</i>

353
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:34,486
{\an8}<i>leaders from all walks of life</i>
<i>in addition to the religious community</i>

354
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:35,654
<i>are in utter shock.</i>

355
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:40,325
<i>Judging from the writing on the wall,</i>
<i>the police suspect it was the Vigilante...</i>

356
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,619
CHO GANGOK:
LET'S MEET IN THE PARKING LOT

357
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:44,621
What happened?

358
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:49,542
<i>Just...</i>
<i>don't say anything.</i>

359
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:51,836
Just for five days...

360
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:56,091
Whatever I do,
don't say anything for five just days.

361
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:59,135
He killed Pastor Shin.
Don't you know we're the next targets?

362
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,889
-This could get out of...
<i>-Then, are you going to fix it?</i>

363
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:06,434
Right, you can't since you are
the university president now.

364
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,729
<i>I'll take care of it,</i>
<i>so give me just five days.</i>

365
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,608
Choi Miryeo, Jo Heon,

366
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,944
and the Vigilante...

367
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,155
I'll take them all out...

368
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:24,285
President Eom Jaehyub.

369
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,642
Just a second.

370
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,522
Done.

371
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,819
CURRENCY EXCHANGE BETWEEN FOREIGN ACCOUNTS

372
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,030
Where did you get this?

373
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:04,492
Well, my company has
its own investigation team.

374
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,202
So I knew it all along.

375
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:09,456
I thought it'd help you judge this case,

376
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,832
so I'm giving this in secret.

377
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:18,423
So you also had intel
that the Vigilante had.

378
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,301
Is that it?

379
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,888
Well, I guess so.

380
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:27,891
Do you know who he is?

381
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:35,690
No. I'm sure he had a way to get it.

382
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:37,942
In any case,

383
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:41,905
the file in this USB shows
who the pastor really was.

384
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:46,075
And it's up to you to decide
how to use it.

385
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:54,667
See you later.

386
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,175
She must've forgotten to thank me.

387
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,144
Sly bastard.

388
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,912
<i>V NEWS</i>
WE DELIVER THE TRUTH

389
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:19,043
<i>I'm sure you remember</i>
<i>Pastor Shin Jongun was murdered recently.</i>

390
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,128

<i>Everyone,</i>

397
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:47,363

<i>- What is it?</i>
<i>- Stop.</i>

399
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,303
Mr. Jo...

400
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,057
Where did you get the file?

401
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,685
What are you doing?

402
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,730
You can't barge in like this.

403
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,067
Ms. Choi.

404
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:25,860
From now on,

405
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:31,032
I'll speak informally to you.

406
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,116
No.

407
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,704
And get out right now.

408
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:41,668
The Vigilante is somewhere around you.

409
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:46,714
Don't you know how dangerous that is?

410
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,007
Superintendent Jo Heon.

411
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,511
I am not afraid, so leave.

412
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:55,640
I'm sure the Vigilante gave you that file.

413
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,395
You're egging on the Vigilante,

414
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:05,566
making a hero of him, and inciting people!

415
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,487
You're making things worse...

416
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,785
and making the wound called the Vigilante

417
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,288
fester hopelessly.

418
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,543
For a cheap ratings hit.

419
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,754
Because of that immature thought...

420
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,342
your own death

421
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,805
is staring you right in the face.

422
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,559
But why can't you see it?

423
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,198
Wow...

424
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,827
You're a man of great insight.

425
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:01,289
But why can't you see how fearless I am?

426
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,708
Thank you

427
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,711
for that fair criticism.

428
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:10,965
But not everyone
in this world is that obedient.

429
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,719
I'm going to keep helping the Vigilante.

430
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,139
I'll take the risk.

431
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:23,269
Only those as bold as I am could handle
the Vigilante. Don't you agree?

432
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:26,898
And one more thing.

433
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,196
Don't you ever talk
informally to me again.

434
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,033
Understood?

435
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,296
Mr. Bang.

436
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,761
You're awfully fast for such a big guy.

437
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,388
It's intriguing.

438
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,141
You goddamn vermin.

439
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,976
Oh, my. I know it's hard to move
when you're cut there.

440
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,311
Isn't it painful?

441
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,855
You think you can stab me again?

442
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:34,025
Soedol. Why drag this out?

443
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,193
We got a lot to do.

444
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,239
Who's ordering you?

445
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,990
Why do you need to know?

446
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,450
You'll die anyways.

447
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,207
Try your best.

448
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,794
If you fail to kill me today,

449
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,839
I'll kill you when we meet again!

450
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,657
Wow, I'm impressed.

451
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,455
I'll make sure it's a quick end.

452
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,166
Good-bye.

453
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,184
The Vigilante?

454
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,687
What's with you two?

455
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,700
See you again soon.
