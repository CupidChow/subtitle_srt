ALL CHARACTERS, EVENTS, LOCATIONS
AND INCIDENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:19,227
<i> Last night,</i>
<i>in the underground parking lot</i>

3
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,520
<i>of an apartment in Seoul,</i>

4
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:23,606
<i>a police officer was attacked</i>
<i>by an unknown duo</i>

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,108
<i>and was seriously injured.</i>

6
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:29,154
<i>And the one who saved the officer</i>
<i>was none other than the Vigilante.</i>

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,489
<i>According to a witness,</i>

8
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:34,075
<i>towards the end of the attack,</i>

9
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,328
{\an8}<i>the Vigilante suddenly appeared</i>
<i>and helped the officer.</i>

10
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,830
{\an8}<i>I was going home after work</i>

11
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:42,083
{\an8}<i>when I heard a crash,</i>
<i>and I thought there was a car accident.</i>

12
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:45,920
{\an8}<i>But it turned out that two people</i>
<i>were attacking another person.</i>

13
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,674
<i>It seemed like they were trying</i>
<i>to kill each other. It was so scary.</i>

14
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:50,800
<i>The police has presumed</i>

15
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,928
<i>this incident was premeditated retaliation</i>
<i>by a criminal organization,</i>

16
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,346
<i>and they are now trying to track down</i>

17
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,390
<i>the duo and the Vigilante.</i>

18
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,018
<i> Hey, Jiyong.</i>

19
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,853
<i>What happened?</i>

20
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,938
<i>This wasn't in our plans.</i>

21
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,232
It was a part of the plan.

22
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,026
<i>Helping Jo Heon?</i>

23
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,361
I said he'll only get in our way.

24
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:11,905
No.

25
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,032
I will...

26
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,203
turn him into another Vigilante.

27
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,839
That's my Jiyong.

28
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:36,346
VIGILANTE

29
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,252
I'm here to see Captain Jo Heon.

30
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:10,421
He's still unconscious,
so you can't see him.

31
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,478
Chief Eom Jaehyub.

32
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,068
Could you tell Captain Jo for me

33
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,905
that I wish him a speedy recovery?

34
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,283
I mean it.

35
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,202
I'll see you again.

36
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,311
Fortunately, the vital organs
weren't harmed, so he'll live.

37
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,981
But we'll have to see
how long it'll take to recover.

38
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,774
I see. Please take good care of him.

39
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,943
He's an old colleague of mine.

40
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,988
Yes, sir. We'll do our best.

41
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,255
So how's work as the university president?

42
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,675
Good. I'm doing my best.

43
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,093
And how's Jo Heon?

44
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,222
I think he'll be out of action
for quite a while.

45
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,352
It's better to lie low
in hectic times like these.

46
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,606
I'll bring you back
once Kim's taken care of,

47
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:52,815
so don't be discouraged.

48
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,484
Thank you, sir.

49
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,904
I won't disappoint you again.

50
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,573
Have some sashimi. It's quite nice.

51
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,658
Yes, sir.

52
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,092
Mr. Bang, just what are you doing?

53
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,511
What did I pay you all that money for?

54
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,096
You should earn your keep.

55
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,890
<i>How could you fucking fail to kill him?</i>

56
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:27,725
Mr. Kim.

57
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,145
I'm in a pretty bad mood right now.

58
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,230
Do you want to die?

59
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,274
What was that, you bastard?

60
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:38,569
I'll do things my way now,
so just keep yourself safe.

61
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:42,323
If you make me angrier,
I'll go get you first.

62
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,785
That son of a bitch.

63
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,348
Take everything. They're important.

64
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,519
So this has all the QQ Coin private keys?

65
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:16,524
You idiot! Do you know
how much that's worth?

66
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,818
-Be careful with it.
-I'm sorry, sir.

67
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,158
What in the world?

68
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,913
What the hell?

69
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:34,542
Hey!
What the fuck is going on?

70
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,341
Damn it!

71
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,655
{\an8}HANEUL ORPHANAGE

72
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:38,523
<i> Hello, everyone. This is</i> V News.

73
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:42,568
What I'm about to show you
is an office in Gangnam

74
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,404
that caught on fire last night.

75
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,156
It may look like a mere case of a fire,

76
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,077
but the photos taken
by a firefighter at the scene

77
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,954
tell us it is not.

78
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,333
"I'm taking the private keys.

79
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,794
"I'll sell the QQ Coin
and donate the money.

80
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,838
"Before I donate it all,

81
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:05,007
"Kim Samdoo, Eom Jaehyub,
and the hitmen should turn themselves in."

82
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,051
That's right.

83
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:12,473
The fire was not an accident,
but the Vigilante's counterattack.

84
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,601
He mentioned Kim Samdoo,

85
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,271
Eom Jaehyub the Vole,
and the hitmen in the same breath.

86
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,689
What could this mean?

87
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:24,152
The fire occurred in an office
registered as a Sewool subsidiary,

88
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,779
and QQ Coin has appeared again.

89
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,990
Doesn't this explain it all?

90
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,911
But the police continue
to put off the investigation,

91
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,330
because they claim a lack of evidence.

92
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,624
What could be the real reason?

93
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,960
<i>V News</i> will get to

94
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,671
the bottom of this case.

95
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,506
<i>Next is some heartwarming news.</i>

96
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,343
<i>Early this morning, a person in a hoodie</i>
<i>left 200 million won in cash</i>

97
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,762
<i>in front of an orphanage</i>
<i>in Seoul and vanished.</i>

98
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,139
<i>And it's the talk of the town.</i>

99
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,600
{\an8}<i>We were having a difficult time,</i>

100
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,101
{\an8}<i>so it'll be very helpful.</i>

101
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,439
<i>I'll put it to good use for the children.</i>

102
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,232
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

103
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,110
<i> The police conducted</i>
<i>an intensive search and seizure</i>

104
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,279
<i>on Sewool Future Resources this morning.</i>

105
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,781
<i>Chairman Kim Samdoo</i>
<i>is not responding to the summons,</i>

106
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:14,660
<i>saying the police will have to</i>

107
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,497
{\an8}<i>Also, the police plan</i>
<i>to focus on investigating</i>

108
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,333
{\an8}<i>the Vigilante, the hitmen</i>
<i>who attacked an officer,</i>

109
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:24,879
{\an8}<i>and the relationship</i>
<i>between Choi Miryeo and the Vigilante.</i>

110
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,881
<i>This has been</i>
<i>a social affairs news update.</i>

111
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,385
-Eat some more meat.
-Okay.

112
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,015
Who could it be at this hour?

113
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,808
It's all right. I'll get the door.

114
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,822
How are you, sir?

115
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,620
Son of a... How could you show up here?

116
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,955
What if someone sees us?

117
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,332
Well, Mr. Eom...

118
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,877
I mean Chief,

119
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:08,214
you keep trying to
cut me loose with all the blame,

120
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,216
so I came to see

121
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,635
how you were doing.

122
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,681
So the kids haven't gone
to school yet, right?

123
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,642
Let's go in.

124
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,852
I should say hello to your wife.

125
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:29,777
Let's talk here.

126
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,945
Sir.

127
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,991
I know who's behind you,

128
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,911
and whose political funds
the QQ Coin is going to be used for.

129
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,330
I know everything.

130
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,583
Okay?

131
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,502
If I'm about to I go down,

132
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,671
don't you think
I should find ways to survive?

133
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,466
Please make sure
that doesn't happen to me.

134
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,304
I doubt your plan
will go smoothly without me. Right?

135
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,392
Are you threatening me?

136
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,729
I'm asking you nicely.

137
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,896
Shut it.

138
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,609
Just serve six months.

139
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,360
I'll just have them conclude

140
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,280
that we found
some illegal business activities.

141
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,033
If you say anything about me,

142
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,160
you'll only get a longer prison term.

143
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,791
Is this the best you can do?

144
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:31,464
You failed to take care of them
and made it come to this.

145
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,550
What can I do when my name
keeps being mentioned, too?

146
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,179
Stop the Vigilante
from continuing to go after us.

147
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,390
Then, I'll get you out as soon as I can.

148
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,451
No. Get back in.

149
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,248
You fucking bastard.

150
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,209
Hey.

151
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,337
What the hell is with you?

152
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,588
Hey, Hong.

153
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,715
You son of a bitch.
Are you a fucking moron?

154
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,843
Do your job right, you motherfucker!

155
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,303
God fucking damn it.

156
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:22,932
I'm sorry, sir.

157
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:30,064
Whether it's Bang or Eom,
don't fucking trust anyone.

158
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,066
We'll move on our own.

159
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,193
Yes, sir.

160
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:38,280
Whether you torture Choi Miryeo or rip her
to pieces, I don't fucking care.

161
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,366
Find out where the Vigilante is.

162
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,450
At all cost.

163
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,413
They're definitely connected.

164
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:47,748
I'm sure of it.

165
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,461
After Jo Heon was replaced,

166
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:57,591
he was attacked by hitmen
and the Vigilante came to help him.

167
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,220
And it was in the parking lot
of Choi Miryeo's office.

168
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,471
Exactly.

169
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,182
There seems to be something
between the three.

170
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,728
Request a search warrant
for Choi's office.

171
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,646
Yes, sir.

172
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:18,028
Sir, what should we do
about Chief Eom Jaehyub?

173
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,452
{\an8}I'LL SELL THE QQ COIN AND DONATE THE MONEY

174
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,121
{\an8}KIM, EOM, AND THE HITMEN
SHOULD TURN THEMSELVES IN

175
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:28,789
Put it on hold.

176
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,126
Understood, sir.

177
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:39,884
Dear Lord,

178
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,846
please grant eternal rest
to all those who have passed.

179
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,185
Let bright light shine upon them,

180
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,062
and let them feel true joy.

181
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,568
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

182
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,487
Amen.

183
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,691
HANEUL ORPHANAGE

184
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,840
Guys, big news.

185
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,425
-What is it this time?
-It's really big news.

186
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,887
I heard President Eom Jaehyub
could get fired soon.

187
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,556
What?

188
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,766
So he's really involved with Sewool?

189
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,309
Think about it.

190
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,563
He was on a roll
climbing the ladder among the elites,

191
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,399
but ended up as the university president.

192
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,277
I'm pretty sure something happened.

193
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,947
You're right. This is why
people should live by the book.

194
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,031
And honestly.

195
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,703
<i>This is a shocking case.</i>

196
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,415
<i>-Many Vigilante copycats have appeared...</i>
-What?

197
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:37,251
{\an8}<i>But they've never killed</i>
<i>an innocent person before.</i>

198
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:40,462
{\an8}<i>On top of that, the victim was</i>
<i>the director of Haneul Orphanage</i>

199
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,007
{\an8}<i>who had been helping</i>
<i>those in need all her life.</i>

200
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,550
{\an8}<i>Our reporter Park has more.</i>

201
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:49,346
{\an8}<i> There was a murder</i>
<i>at Haneul Orphanage in Seoul last night.</i>

202
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,932
{\an8}<i>Recently, the orphanage</i>
<i>drew a lot of attention</i>

203
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:55,019
{\an8}<i>after receiving a large sum</i>
<i>from an anonymous donor.</i>

204
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:58,439
<i>The police believe a criminal organization</i>
<i>committed this murder</i>

205
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:02,568
<i>due to a grudge against the recent center</i>
<i>of conversation, the Vigilante,</i>

206
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,528
<i>and they have launched an investigation.</i>

207
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,488
<i>Reporting from the scene, I'm Park Seoha.</i>

208
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,564
CRAZY

209
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,111
Are you okay, Jiyong?
Why didn't you pick up?

210
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:30,531
Those bastards
are calling the Vigilante out.

211
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,661
I need to make a move
before any more innocent people die.

212
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,414
What are you going to do? It's a trap.

213
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,957
<i>Keep an eye on Choi Miryeo.</i>

214
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,378
-I'm sure they'll come for her again.
<i>-I got it.</i>

215
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,340
It's finally beginning.

216
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,241
A knight?

217
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:16,785
Me?

218
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,143
Yoon, take the emergency stairs.

219
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,478
Seo, cut off the CCTV.

220
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,772
-The rest will take the elevator.
-Yes, sir.

221
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,356
Two here, and two there.

222
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,615
Find her!

223
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:37,783
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

224
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,126
SEWOOL FUTURE RESOURCES

225
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,172
<i>V NEWS</i> LIVE BROADCAST

226
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:58,345
{\an8}Everyone, this is not a fabrication.
This is happening for real.

227
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,143
No way. What's this? Is this real?

228
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,186
What is it?

229
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,855
It's <i>V News.</i>

230
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,399
Holy cow. <i>V News</i> is getting raided.

231
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,568
Choi Miryeo's office is being attacked.

232
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,737
-Is it live?
<i>-Sir!</i>

233
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:20,367
Sir, Choi Miryeo
is being attacked right now.

234
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,079
Let's go.

235
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,751
Sir, it seems Choi Miryeo
is streaming this live.

236
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:30,836
God damn it.

237
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:32,671
Destroy all the cameras.

238
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,339
-Find them now!
-Yes, sir!

239
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,095
Hurry up and find them!

240
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:56,737
Hey!

241
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,614
Hey.

242
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,702
Come out!

243
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:04,870
Come on out!

244
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:07,664
I said come out!

245
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,214
You sneaky little bitch.

246
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,717
Give me the phone, you bitch!

247
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,698
Come here, you fucking bitch.

248
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:42,866
Come here!

249
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,663
Get him!

250
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,830
Sons of bitches.

251
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,252
God damn it.

252
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,179
Stop!

253
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,111
Ms. Choi.

254
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,722
How many times do I have to tell you?

255
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,476
I've been regularly threatened,

256
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,979
so I just set up cameras here and there.

257
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,817
And some guy who saw the live broadcast

258
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,487
came and saved me. That's all.

259
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,072
Ms. Choi.

260
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,117
Do you think that kind of coincidence

261
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,703
is possible?

262
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,083
Yes.

263
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,170
That's why it's a coincidence.

264
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:04,841
And you didn't plan this
with the Vigilante to lure the thugs?

265
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,767
You think that was the Vigilante?

266
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,772
The guy using a bat was the Vigilante?

267
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:20,941
I'm sorry,

268
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,153
but the Vigilante never uses a weapon.

269
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,248
I will catch the Vigilante soon.

270
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,335
And once I do...

271
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,631
I'll give you a chance to see who he is.

272
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,217
My friend is walking
a tightrope right now.

273
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,512
If something like this happens again,

274
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,224
don't put yourself in danger and just run.

275
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:38,977
We still have a lot to do.

276
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,484
We'll conduct today's discussion
with these three reasons.

277
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,027
First,

278
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,239
as time goes by, crimes--

279
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,991
I'm sorry to interrupt, sir.
But it's urgent.

280
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:39,746
Kim Jiyong.

281
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,208
Come out.

282
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,640
-Jiyong.
-Yes, sir?

283
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,185
You know <i>V News</i> was attacked, right?

284
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,105
Yes, I do.

285
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,357
Where were you
and what were you doing at that time?

286
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,652
Tell me everything you did
after the terminal.

287
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:17,742
It's my private life.

288
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,790
Do you think I'm asking
because of your private life?

289
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:28,920
I'm sorry,

290
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,716
but on what grounds am I a suspect?

291
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,221
You met with the former team leader.

292
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,182
Your physique is similar
to the Vigilante's.

293
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:46,896
And the phone used during the crimes
was once turned on here at school.

294
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,612
We've looked through
everything already, so be honest.

295
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:54,696
Captain Nam.

296
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,660
This is a school.
You know what that means, right?

297
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:05,540
Until he's proven guilty, I'd like you
not to treat my student that way.

298
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,503
I'm doing my best to be considerate.

299
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,757
I'm even questioning him in your presence.

300
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,183
Kim Jiyong.

301
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,144
This is your last chance.

302
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,523
You won't talk?

303
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,779
I've done nothing wrong.

304
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,449
Honestly, sir.

305
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:53,213
Do you really think he's the Vigilante?

306
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:57,759
To sell cryptocurrency,
you have to use a phone with a wallet.

307
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,969
And guess where it was turned on.

308
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:04,683
It was 100-50, Gwangsan-gil, Sinnam-myeon,
Asan, South Chungcheong Province.

309
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:06,726
Korean National Police University.

310
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,438
Someone turned it on
by mistake and turned it off.

311
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,607
The forensics report will tell us

312
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,193
who the Vigilante really is.

313
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,702
But wouldn't it be too much
for him to handle by himself?

314
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,203
What if Jo Heon's in on it?

315
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,747
Then, it all makes sense.

316
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:34,212
Is Jo Heon still unconscious?

317
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,589
Yes, he hasn't woken up yet.

318
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,220
Let's go.

319
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:49,936
Hey.

320
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,774
Jiyong is going to be okay, right?

321
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:58,236
You know him.
He'll brush it off and be okay.

322
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,335
No visitors, sir.

323
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,964
Nam Yeongil, team leader of the RIU.

324
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:29,684
What on Earth...

325
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,479
have you done?

326
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,786
I will carry out my duty.

327
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,039
I ask for your understanding

328
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,626
to let a fellow police officer fix

329
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,921
another officer's mistake.

330
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,036
Two!

331
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,538
Three!

332
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:32,872
Four!

333
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:36,084
One, two, three, four.

334
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,837
One, two, three, four!

335
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,921
One!

336
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:41,756
Guys.

337
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,009
It's set. We're getting an afternoon off
for the first time in a while.

338
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,011
So we'll hit some balls together.
Understood?

339
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,179
You have to come.

340
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,057
I have to help the professor
finish his app.

341
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,183
I'll go next time.

342
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,520
When will you ever do as I say?

343
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,482
Jiyong. You'll come, right?

344
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,986
I have to catch up
on papers I have to write.

345
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,739
Jiyong, wait. Hey.

346
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,416
You did a good job of saving Choi Miryeo.

347
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,835
We really need her.

348
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,296
That was a cakewalk for me.

349
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:25,091
But why do we need her so much?

350
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,888
The climax at the end...

351
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:33,391
No one's better than her
at reporting things raw.

352
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,810
Right, that nutjob...

353
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,148
So tell me. What's our next plan?

354
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:45,987
Hey.

355
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,697
<i> Jiyong, this is bad.</i>

356
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,790
Captain Nam returned and he's taking
all of the professor's computers.

357
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,959
And they went to search the men's dorm.

358
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,044
Will you be okay?

359
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,797
Yeah, I'll be okay.

360
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,052
Stay with the professor and help him.

361
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,387
Call me if anything else happens.

362
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,847
Okay, I will.

363
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,600
Sir.

364
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:18,102
The forensics report
of the location is out.

365
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,730
Where is it?

366
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:42,877
PRESIDENT'S OFFICE

367
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,672
We're going to search here?

368
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,092
Sir, shouldn't we first check...

369
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,510
Who was it?

370
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:52,845
A friend.

371
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,140
The police are searching my school.

372
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,102
I turned on a phone
with QQ Coin and left a trace.

373
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,190
<i>I made it look like Eom Jaehyub</i>
<i>used cryptocurrency.</i>

374
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,818
<i>And guess what I found in there?</i>

375
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,195
What did you find?

376
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,532
A burner phone he used
to contact Kim Samdoo.

377
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,618
I'm sure they've found
the evidence by now.

378
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,967
What do you think you're doing?

379
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:32,593
Sir.

380
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,059
Mr. Eom.

381
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:42,895
Is this phone yours?

382
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,564
What are you doing?

383
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,943
If not, I'll hand it over
to the Digital Forensics Center.

384
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:54,782
Give us a minute.

385
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,118
Yes, sir.

386
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,957
What is it that you want?

387
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:08,504
The real truth behind this case.

388
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:16,054
If there's anything you need
to confess, I'll give you some time.

389
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,391
I'll wait until I arrive
at the DFC with this.

390
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,560
I'll give you until then.

391
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,079
Sir.

392
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,456
I found this in the bookshelf.

393
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,459
I'll head back first.

394
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:47,919
You wrap things up here first.

395
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,296
Yes, sir.

396
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:53,883
It's me.

397
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,762
There's someone
I need you to persuade urgently.

398
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,432
Yes.

399
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,520
It's Nam Yeongil, team leader of the RIU.

400
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,064
He's leaving
National Police University now.

401
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,483
Yes.

402
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:12,819
Thank you.

403
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,030
I trust you.

404
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:37,677
CONFISCATED ARTICLE

405
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,695
Sir, we just got a call.

406
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,948
Captain Nam Yeongil died in an accident.

407
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,971
Hey, how did it go? Is the search over?

408
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,515
<i>Captain Nam died in an accident.</i>

409
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,021
Are you sure?

410
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,105
<i>Yeah.</i>

411
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,274
<i>The search team is leaving in a hurry.</i>

412
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,474
Should I stoke the fire?

413
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,186
Yeah, make it nice and hot.

414
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:27,972
It wasn't my doing.

415
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,892
All I did...

416
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,231
was lead Captain Nam to find
proper evidence.

417
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,066
So if the law punishes them...

418
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:45,740
I told you to stop.

419
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,661
Mr. Jo.

420
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:56,459
Captain Nam died,
because he was a good cop!

421
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,086
Am I wrong?

422
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:04,800
I've made up my mind

423
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,345
to kill them all.

424
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,222
They will kill you mercilessly!

425
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,767
No one will care...

426
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,895
if you die.

427
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,606
And they'll never know.

428
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,902
I don't care.

429
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,032
Whether the Vigilante succeeds or fails,

430
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,994
there's at least one person
who will report on it.

431
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:35,790
And even if no one finds out,
at least you will know!

432
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,169
To prove himself...

433
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,715
a man beat his head
against a wall and tried.

434
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,516
If you still want to stop me...

435
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,395
kill me now.

436
00:39:58,813 --> 00:39:59,897
I won't avoid it.

437
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,107
But if not...

438
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,821
what you told me about...

439
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,615
That justice.

440
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,286
Now, you must show me.
