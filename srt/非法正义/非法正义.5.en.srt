1
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,020
ALL CHARACTERS, EVENTS, LOCATIONS
AND INCIDENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:30,948
By the way,

3
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,409
how did you know I'd be here?

4
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:38,163
I looked up and found
that the university has fixed off days.

5
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,376
And I found out you lived in Seoul
during my part-time job.

6
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:44,878
- Part-time job?
- Yes.

7
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,880
When I was acting like you'd saved me.

8
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,216
Was I any good?

9
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,885
Then you must know who employed you.

10
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,387
I thought it was you?

11
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:58,225
The agency gives us a job,
and we act as we're told

12
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,769
and get paid. That's all.

13
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,042
We don't know who requests the jobs.

14
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,568
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

15
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:19,973
Hey, bro.

16
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:23,083
You're on a date. I'm so
jealous. So, are you enjoying the dinner?

17
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:24,793
What do you want?

18
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,422
I saw you talking with Jo Heon.
What did you talk about?

19
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,174
None of your business.

20
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,509
<i>Jiyong, it's me.</i>

21
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,261
<i>I told you, you need me.</i>

22
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,806
Jo Heon is a puppet of those in power.
He's our common enemy.

23
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,809
It's time for us to join forces.

24
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,395
You're with him, aren't you?

25
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,231
I think you are.

26
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:48,358
You're not telling me
what you talked about.

27
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,651
He knows about me.

28
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,695
What?

29
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,447
Only two people know about me.

30
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,948
You and Jo Heon.

31
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,201
<i>It's suspicious.</i>

32
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:00,746
Someone other than me knows about you?
Damn it.

33
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,373
<i>We're not meeting today.</i>

34
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,833
<i>And one more thing.</i>

35
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,420
I know you cloned my cell.
Bring me his cloned phone.

36
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,298
Then we'll talk in person.

37
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,759
<i>About you and me working together.</i>

38
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:19,097
What... How did you know
I was peeping into your phone?

39
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:22,059
You're making it so obvious.
How can I not know?

40
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,228
<i>Okay, fine.</i>

41
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:25,979
But you're not...

42
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,067
thinking of getting out of this

43
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,112
after killing Jo Heon and me, are you?

44
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,291
Contact me after cloning his phone.

45
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,897
Wow...

46
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,943
This is too big for Yeon Jaehak
to handle by himself.

47
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:56,987
It has to be Sewool's.

48
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,037
They have illegal servers
in a place like this?

49
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,670
QQ Coin?

50
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,260
The bastards are doing
everything that makes money.

51
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:47,931
Daeseok, run!

52
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,454
Go! Hurry!

53
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,745
VIGILANTE

54
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,474
What?

55
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:16,603
What's going on? There's nothing here.

56
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:23,485
They were definitely here.
Computers and servers.

57
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:31,743
See? They were here.

58
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,125
Then what about the reporter
you said was killed?

59
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,883
This is crazy.

60
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,435
Let's wrap it up and go back.
I'll talk to her.

61
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:03,525
Ma'am, we understand what you said.
We will look into it.

62
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:07,571
We'll call you in for questioning
if necessary,

63
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,947
so you should go home for now.

64
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,992
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

65
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,790
CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL
EOM JAEHYUB

66
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:05,671
Jo Heon speaking.

67
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,632
It's been a while
since I sent you to catch the Vigilante.

68
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:09,967
Why is there no news?

69
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:12,261
I got some leads.

70
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,763
I'll call you when I get him.

71
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,015
After I retire?

72
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:20,561
You entrusted me with it,
so please continue to do so.

73
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,399
The realignment is around the corner.

74
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:29,528
Take care of it before that
so it won't hold me back.

75
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,113
Understood, sir.

76
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:51,425
Jiyong, let me hold it for you.

77
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:53,677
Your phone was off two nights ago.

78
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,971
Were you doing something important?

79
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,654
I went to bed early because I was tired.

80
00:09:58,182 --> 00:09:59,183
So with who?

81
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,643
What do you mean? I slept alone.

82
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,562
Just be honest.

83
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,024
- He's not answering.
- Right.

84
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,610
Are you going
to keep secrets from us like this?

85
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:15,616
See? He's acting suspicious, isn't he?

86
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:17,451
Yes, very.

87
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:28,378
HAPJEONG STATION EXIT 2, LOCKER NO.
- 1004

88
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,930
Good!
You could be a professional.

89
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,014
One, two.

90
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:42,559
Good!

91
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,647
It's not enough.

92
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,815
I'd like it to be more intense next time.

93
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,025
Thank you.

94
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,115
You're working out harder lately.

95
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,409
You seem to have gotten faster.

96
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,662
I should stay in tip-top shape
all the time.

97
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:06,208
You never know
when fun things will happen.

98
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:31,817
CALLS
EOM JAEHYUB, CAPTAIN EUN

99
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:43,537
LIVE BROADCAST, REPO25H

100
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:48,083
<i>I am sure you all heard actor Yeon Jaehak,</i>

101
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,836
<i>who had been arrested
for running an illegal website,</i>

102
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,129
<i>committed suicide.</i>

103
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,341
<i>He died on the day he was supposed
to meet our staff.</i>

104
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,845
<i>These are the texts he sent us.</i>

105
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,680
<i>Hello, this is actor Yeon Jaehak.</i>

106
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:05,058
<i>I have evidence
that Sewool Future Resources is</i>

107
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:07,519
<i>the one who ran the illegal website,
not me.</i>

108
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:09,938
<i>I'd like to tell you the truth in person.</i>

109
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,775
<i>A person who was going to
commit suicide wouldn't send this.</i>

110
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:16,320
<i>Let's take a look.</i>

111
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:21,950
<i>This is where Yeon Jaehak
supposedly ran the illegal website.</i>

112
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:26,079
<i>As soon as you enter the location,
you can see hundreds of mining machines</i>

113
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:29,416
<i>and traces of QQ Coin mining.</i>

114
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:36,340
<i>Also, there is circumstantial evidence
that someone tried to kill our reporter.</i>

115
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:40,886
In fact, a reporter was murdered,
with his body still missing.

116
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,597
And reporter Choi Miryeo,
who was with him,

117
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,182
narrowly escaped.

118
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,018
There is another case.

119
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:54,024
You have probably heard of an illegal
cryptocurrency exchange through QQ Coin

120
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,484
that happened recently.

121
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,486
<i>A whopping 800 billion.</i>

122
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:02,741
<i>Since the transaction,
there is no trace of the culprit.</i>

123
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,702
There is one more thing.

124
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,041
Chairman Kim Samdoo who was recently
released after being found not guilty...

125
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,419
Sir, you have a call from the Vole.

126
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,551
To what do I owe the pleasure?

127
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:21,754
<i>Mr. Kim.</i>

128
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:24,555
<i>Turn on</i> REPO25h <i>right now.</i>

129
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:29,184
Turn on the TV. <i>REPO25h.</i>

130
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,730
<i>Here are the texts
we received from Yeon Jaehak.</i>

131
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,317
<i>I'll reveal everything about Eom Jaehyub,</i>

132
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:40,571
<i>aka the Vole,
who is backing Sewool.</i>

133
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,323
It seems there's one more dog
sniffing around.

134
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:48,036
Is this how you plan to work?

135
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,211
Eom Jaehyub...

136
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,925
EOM JAEHYUB

137
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:12,436
<i>Yes, this is all circumstantial for now.</i>

138
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:18,400
<i>However, we are slowly uncovering evidence
to back up this assumption.</i>

139
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:23,197
<i>Did Yeon Jaehak really commit suicide?</i>

140
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:29,536
<i>And what are the connections between
Sewool and Eom Jaehyub, the Vole?</i>

141
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,583
<i>We promise to only deliver
the facts and truth</i>

142
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:38,378
<i>without caving in
to any external pressure and threats.</i>

143
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:41,089
Shit. You think that's true?

144
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:42,758
It better not be.

145
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:46,553
Isn't it too big a case
to be bait for the Vigilante?

146
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,263
Choi Miryeo...

147
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,642
- Hello, sir.
- Hello...

148
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:55,938
Kwak Changhyun, are you fucking crazy?

149
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:58,232
Who said you could air that?

150
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:01,568
- Pardon?
- The report on <i>REPO25h.</i>

151
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:04,321
You gave Choi the right

152
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,740
to cover anything
without your permission, so...

153
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,033
Hey!

154
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,952
How could you really do that?

155
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,829
Do you know who just called me?

156
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,040
God damn it.

157
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,210
Why did Moon from Dongseon have to...

158
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:19,670
God damn it!

159
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,590
In any case,
you take care of this.

160
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:25,175
Understood?

161
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,427
But how can I...

162
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:29,054
I mean Choi Miryeo!

163
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:32,808
Make sure she never does
something like this again.

164
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:35,769
I made myself clear.

165
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:39,064
If you can't, just quit!

166
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:43,277
Damn it.

167
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,698
Son of a bitch.

168
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,658
- Good work.
- Good work.

169
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,341
- Good work.
- Where's Miryeo?

170
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:52,953
Hey, Choi Miryeo.

171
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:56,206
Hey, what are you going to do now?

172
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,711
- What do you mean?
- You acted on your own,

173
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:03,589
aired whatever you liked,
and had Reporter Moon killed!

174
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,090
How could a reporter...

175
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,719
Do you even have any feelings of guilt?

176
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,221
How could you do that as a reporter?

177
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,766
Should I stop reporting
just because Daeseok was killed?

178
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:18,353
- Should I stop the show?
- What did you say?

179
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:21,190
You receive bribes,
and you're wined and dined

180
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:24,693
by all kinds of organizations,
companies, and sponsors.

181
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,487
How dare you tell me
what kind of reporter I am!

182
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:39,458
Am I wrong?

183
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:47,966
What am I going to do now?

184
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:52,346
Just wait and see how far I go.

185
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,527
Clean up. Now!

186
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:09,738
Clean this all up. Before I burn it all.

187
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:22,251
- So?
<i>- Yes, it's ready.</i>

188
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:24,086
Make sure to bring the body.

189
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,254
Yes, sir.

190
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,647
- Soedol.
- Yes.

191
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,816
Chop more firewood.
It won't be enough.

192
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:46,900
Yes, sir.

193
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:19,516
Get in!

194
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:25,856
What the heck?

195
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,251
Who are you?

196
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:48,253
Hello.

197
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:51,048
I'm Jo Heon, team leader of the RIU.

198
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:54,635
So?

199
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:57,262
How did you know I'd be attacked here?

200
00:18:58,305 --> 00:18:59,556
Was there a tip?

201
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,641
No.

202
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:03,393
I came for something else.

203
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:10,400
Do not give the Vigilante any more prey.

204
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,363
I don't follow you.

205
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,448
Do not make it worse

206
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:20,118
in order to get scoops.
That's what I mean.

207
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:25,624
If you don't want to be in danger again.

208
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:28,377
That sounds strange.

209
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:32,923
Are you unable to catch the Vigilante?

210
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:35,175
Or are you choosing not to?

211
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,136
Don't you need

212
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:40,973
my show to catch the Vigilante?

213
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:43,433
I don't.

214
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:48,397
The Vigilante will be caught soon.

215
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,691
So you should stop now.

216
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,373
CONTINUE WITH THE RECENT DESTINATION?

217
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,794
Why were you lurking around Choi Miryeo?

218
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,922
What are you talking about? You hit me!

219
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:15,340
Uncuff me, you son of...

220
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:20,512
Why were you lurking around Choi Miryeo?

221
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:23,807
What are you talking about?
I was just passing by, you bastard.

222
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:25,517
Son of a bitch.

223
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:29,271
Here. Write down

224
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:32,316
everyone you've met
for the last six months.

225
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:37,070
Everyone? Even the owner
of my favorite noodles restaurant?

226
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:39,364
Wait!

227
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:42,910
Remember now?

228
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:44,119
I do.

229
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:45,204
Write them down.

00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:55,088

235
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:15,692
Here, sir.

236
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:21,406
Who's Mr. Bang?

237
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:26,537
He's the one who told me
to bring Choi Miryeo.

238
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,331
Chairman Kim Samdoo uses
his services often.

239
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:32,251
I only know his last name.

240
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,337
SOEDOL

241
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,005
And Soedol?

242
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:40,300
He's Mr. Bang's right-hand man.

243
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:43,554
He's well-versed in karate, judo
and wushu. Pretty much everything.

244
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:46,431
I heard he's a huge guy.

245
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:50,018
The Squeezer?

246
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:53,897
He's one of Kim Samdoo's guys.

247
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:56,316
He's a fat bald guy.

248
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,860
He's so freaking strong

249
00:21:57,943 --> 00:22:01,446
that he squeezes people to death.
So he's called the Squeezer.

250
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,574
What ridiculous names.

251
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:05,534
By the way, where are we going, sir?

252
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:09,162
The place you went to most recently.

253
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:12,207
75-9 SAJI-RO, YONGIN-SI

254
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:20,549
If we're going there,
could you bring more people?

255
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:22,801
SOU, SWAT, or something like that.

256
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:24,845
Why would you go alone?

257
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,057
Or if you could drop me here,
I'll take a cab.

258
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:32,311
You don't need me anymore.
I told you everything.

259
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:46,283
All right. Be careful with them.

260
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:47,993
Let's hurry up.

261
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:49,912
Cut this part as well.

262
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:55,500
Hey. Were more people supposed to come?

263
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,128
No, I don't think so.

264
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:03,634
Who are you?

265
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:07,054
We asked who you are, you bastard.

266
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:08,305
Are you deaf?

267
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:15,229
I'm with the police!

268
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:19,107
Please kneel down where you are now.

269
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:23,612
If you do as I say,
I'll treat you like human beings.

270
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:26,573
You bastard!

271
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:46,885
I should get out.

272
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:49,596
Shit. Why can't I get if off? Fuck!

273
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:55,310
Stay back. You bastard!

274
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,781
- Sir.
- Here.

275
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:20,562
<i>Good evening. Breaking news.</i>

276
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:23,899
<i>I'm in front of a temporary building
in Gyeonggi.</i>

277
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:27,027
<i>It looks like a normal factory,</i>

278
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:30,405
<i>but it has been revealed
to be a vigilante murder factory.</i>

279
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:33,784
<i>The vigilante suspects
are now pleading the Fifth</i>

280
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:35,452
<i>and refusing to talk.</i>

281
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:39,206
<i>The location is completely cordoned off,
and KCSI is investigating the scene.</i>

282
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:40,457
They're finally caught.

283
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:44,294
<i>We have analyzed the weapons
found at the scene,</i>

284
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:47,631
<i>and discovered the DNA
of the Vigilante's victims.</i>

285
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:49,883
<i>We have evidence that two of the suspects</i>

286
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:54,721
<i>have worked for the company
that sponsors vigilante activities.</i>

287
00:25:54,805 --> 00:25:56,807
<i>We also found files that contain</i>

288
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,893
the details of the Vigilante cases
in the computers.

289
00:25:59,977 --> 00:26:03,647
But the Vigilante has never hidden bodies
until now.

290
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:05,107
Is it really them?

291
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:09,987
<i>We'll need to investigate further
to be sure,</i>

292
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:13,156
<i>but it seems the suspects formed
a vigilante organization</i>

293
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:18,078
<i>and got rid of the victims' bodies
or displayed them</i>

294
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:19,830
<i>at each member's discretion.</i>

295
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:23,709
These lame guys are the Vigilante?

296
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:28,964
Jo Heon.

297
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:32,092
You're the team leader of the RIU.

298
00:26:33,427 --> 00:26:35,637
How could you do this
without reporting it to me?

299
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:38,473
You think I gave you the right to do that?

300
00:26:38,557 --> 00:26:41,560
What will the media, politicians
and civic groups say?

301
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:49,693
Are you sure they're the Vigilante?

302
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:51,737
I am confident.

303
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,530
That's not what I'm asking...

304
00:26:58,118 --> 00:26:59,369
I have the evidence.

305
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:06,043
How could you let some dog bust our farm?

306
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:07,920
I'm sorry, sir.

307
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:14,551
And why is Jo Heon claiming
that we're the Vigilante?

308
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:18,263
That's what I don't understand either.

309
00:27:19,264 --> 00:27:23,060
Why he helped Choi Miryeo
and framed us.

310
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:27,648
It can't be the Vole, since he wants
Choi Miryeo dead more than anyone.

311
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:30,984
And the Vole's the one
who appointed Jo Heon.

312
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:33,570
It's complicated.

313
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:39,034
No, it's actually simple.

314
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:42,955
There's one more dog now. That's all.

315
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:45,958
All right?

316
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:48,418
Yes, sir. I'll take care of them both.

317
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:09,565
- Thank you.
- Of course,

318
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:12,067
I should join you in doing good
at a time like this.

319
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,569
- Right?
- Thank you.

320
00:28:13,652 --> 00:28:15,279
- Hong, take a picture.
- Yes, sir.

321
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:18,740

323
00:28:20,242 --> 00:28:21,577
That's enough.

324
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,704
The other things are being prepared
as planned.

325
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:27,666
Be careful what you say.

326
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:32,504
- What do I do now?
- Oh, right. Come this way.

327
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,260
I can't believe the Vigilante was
a mere crime organization.

328
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:41,805
What did I tell you? I could just tell.

329
00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:45,142
I knew they were just criminals
from the beginning.

330
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,251

- Congratulations on your acquittal.
- Congratulations, sir.

00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:42,991
Please, enjoy.

335

Open it.

336
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:42,903
Hand in your resignation.

337
00:31:45,948 --> 00:31:48,283
Post your apology
on the viewer bulletin board.

338
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:53,956
Our company image is a mess
because of the Vigilante. Such a mess!

339
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:57,000
Do you really believe
they're the Vigilante?

340
00:31:58,502 --> 00:31:59,795
Is your judgment

341
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:01,672
really that poor?

342
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:07,094
I have nothing more to say. Just quit.

343
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:10,389
Get out.

344
00:32:11,223 --> 00:32:13,141
I think you should come see this.

<i>"Heaven's Net. Forgive me,"
was written on the wall.</i>

353
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:41,169
<i>It is similar to the case</i>

354
00:32:41,253 --> 00:32:44,089
<i>of Jeong Deokheung's murder
from two months ago.</i>

355
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:46,550
<i>It has not been a week
since the police arrested...</i>

356
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:47,634
It's the Vigilante.

357
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:52,639
It's the real Vigilante.

358
00:32:54,183 --> 00:32:55,184
Right?

359
00:32:57,978 --> 00:33:01,231
He's trying to prove
that the police have fabricated it.

360
00:33:02,024 --> 00:33:03,233
"They're not real."

361
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:06,778
"The real Vigilante is here."

362
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:23,170
<i>The police are trying
to find out if it's by the Vigilante.</i>

363
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:25,589
<i>Some claim that the pig farm case was...</i>

364
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:28,258
<i>fabricated to look
like the Vigilante's doing...</i>

365
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:31,136
That's my brother! You're the best!
You're so cool!

366
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:37,309
- It's done. Good work.
- Thank you. Good job.

367
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:38,685
Mr. Kim, why don't you

368
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:40,979
- and the pastor take a picture?
- Sure.

369
00:33:41,063 --> 00:33:42,064
Sir.

370
00:33:43,482 --> 00:33:46,151
Choi Junsik's been killed
by the Vigilante.

371
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:48,695
And the ledger is gone.

372
00:34:02,668 --> 00:34:03,669
Let's take a photo.

373
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,757
Let's take it next time.

374
00:34:11,802 --> 00:34:13,482
- Bring the car around.
- Yes, sir.

375
00:34:14,471 --> 00:34:17,015
Contact the loan sharks and druggies
and tell them

376
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:19,685
to pause their business
and bring the money over.

377
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:20,853
Yes, sir.

378
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:45,502
Kim Jiyong.

379
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:52,778
I'm sure you're busy.
What brings you here, sir?

380
00:35:56,156 --> 00:35:58,116
I'm here to give you a last chance.

381
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,961
Stop this.

382
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:11,338
Stop all this...

383
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:15,092
and follow me.

384
00:36:16,385 --> 00:36:17,886
I'll lead you.

385
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:21,807
I felt it when I first saw you...

386
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:25,936
You've killed someone before.

387
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:32,192
And when you didn't arrest me, I realized

388
00:36:33,235 --> 00:36:35,487
that you take care

389
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:38,282
of cases unofficially on someone's orders.

390
00:36:41,285 --> 00:36:43,245
You and I don't seem very different.

391
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:50,335
So how and where are you going to lead me?

392
00:36:52,337 --> 00:36:53,922
No matter how great something is,

393
00:36:55,674 --> 00:37:00,012
if it's uncontrollable,
it's nothing more than a lethal weapon.

394
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:03,932
The world's better off without it.

395
00:37:04,641 --> 00:37:05,726
Kim Jiyong.

396
00:37:06,977 --> 00:37:11,732
If I guide you well,
you could go places.

397
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:13,025
Sir.

398
00:37:13,984 --> 00:37:15,986
Have you ever been

399
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:19,031
in the shoes of the weak?

400
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,660
Of those who are bullied and abused?

401
00:37:25,621 --> 00:37:28,040
Do you know

402
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:33,420
how it feels to not be able to do anything
when crimes ruin...

403
00:37:36,048 --> 00:37:37,049
your life?

404
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:41,637
When the law you believed was just

405
00:37:43,138 --> 00:37:47,184
is endlessly generous to criminals,
but neglects victims...

406
00:37:48,143 --> 00:37:50,145
When the law that must be sacred

407
00:37:51,355 --> 00:37:53,982
judges differently depending on the person

408
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:56,860
and doesn't protect victims...

409
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,490
When that happens,

410
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:07,204
I believe you have the right
to protect yourself.

411
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:14,378
Now go ahead and say it.

412
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:18,757
I'm sure you have something to say.

413
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,805
No, keep going.

414
00:38:26,557 --> 00:38:28,100
I'll hear you out.

415
00:38:29,643 --> 00:38:30,894
Then, one more thing.

416
00:38:33,856 --> 00:38:35,607
I'll ask you just one more thing.

417
00:38:37,651 --> 00:38:40,028
Let's say someone who ruined
someone else's life

418
00:38:41,864 --> 00:38:44,324
doesn't repent,
even after a generous verdict,

419
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:49,705
and commits the same crimes
after they're released.

420
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:53,584
If you could save lives
of more innocent people

421
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:58,547
by depriving this one criminal
of their human rights,

422
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:03,677
is that right

423
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:06,513
or wrong?

424
00:39:07,556 --> 00:39:09,600
That's your biggest problem.

425
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:14,813
Your confidence that you can't be wrong.

426
00:39:16,064 --> 00:39:17,274
People like you

427
00:39:18,483 --> 00:39:21,820
become monsters eventually.

428
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:25,657
Jiyong.

429
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:30,787
Was it painful?

430
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:33,123
Or...

431
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:36,710
was it fun?

432
00:39:39,004 --> 00:39:40,172
Today, I will...

433
00:39:42,299 --> 00:39:43,425
stop you.

434
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:51,767
I didn't ask you if I'll become a monster
in the future.

435
00:39:52,476 --> 00:39:55,354
I asked you if I was wrong!

436
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:38,105
What do you think is the crime

437
00:40:39,106 --> 00:40:43,026
that society punishes most heavily
across all ages and countries?

438
00:40:44,528 --> 00:40:47,281
Murder? Rape?

439
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:49,700
Arson?

440
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:52,369
No, it's...

441
00:40:53,412 --> 00:40:56,206
treason.

442
00:40:56,999 --> 00:41:02,379
The one who challenges the existing power
and fails it!

443
00:41:04,923 --> 00:41:08,635
Kim Jiyong,
you are not a violent offender.

444
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:12,139
You are a traitor!

445
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:14,933
You're challenging the existing system!

446
00:41:15,017 --> 00:41:17,978
The law! The law you talked about!

447
00:41:19,021 --> 00:41:20,647
You're challenging the law.

448
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:32,451
Even if you feel that you're right,

449
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:37,331
you're challenging the system
with violence.

450
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:39,499
You need to think it over.

451
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:43,879
I'll answer to your question.

452
00:41:44,546 --> 00:41:46,215
I agree with you.

453
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:49,760
But that's how I feel as a human being.

454
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:53,472
It means nothing to me
as a police officer.

455
00:41:54,765 --> 00:41:57,726
My job gives meaning to my life.

456
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:00,354
And I'm proud to be a police officer.

457
00:42:02,231 --> 00:42:06,860
But as proud as I am
to be a civil servant,

458
00:42:06,944 --> 00:42:10,155
there are so many
incompetent and lazy police officers,

459
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:13,534
even corrupt ones.

460
00:42:13,617 --> 00:42:15,869
That's what pains me.

461
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:20,999
And that's why I feel sorry for you.

462
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:24,086
The man who abhors crimes

463
00:42:25,045 --> 00:42:28,215
and is ready to fight against crimes!

464
00:42:29,466 --> 00:42:31,677
If you slightly change direction,

465
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:35,806
you could become
such a great police officer.

466
00:42:44,147 --> 00:42:47,109
Traitor Kim Jiyong.

467
00:42:51,655 --> 00:42:52,948
Die.

468
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:56,243
I think that's the only solution.
