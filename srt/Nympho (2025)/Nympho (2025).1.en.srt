[cellphone ringing]

00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:06,744
Good afternoon, boss.

5
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,475
Okay, boss.
I’ll take care of it.

6
00:03:20,573 --> 00:03:21,756
I’ll be right there.

7
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:47,279
Babe, you’re early.

8
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:53,032
Yes, babe. I need to go to work,
my boss told me to hurry to the event.

9
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:56,377
Really? Have a quick breakfast then.

10
00:03:57,777 --> 00:03:59,195
That’s delicious.

11
00:04:04,657 --> 00:04:06,865
Wait, why aren’t you dressed up yet?

12
00:04:07,703 --> 00:04:10,957
I’ll meet a buyer
for lunch at 12.

13
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,404
Sorry, I really need to go, babe.

14
00:04:17,077 --> 00:04:20,077
- You won’t finish that?
- No, I can’t. You take care.

15
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,694
You sure? You might get hungry later.

16
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,138
You take care, babe! I’m off.

17
00:04:24,871 --> 00:04:25,972
Okay, you take care, too!

18
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:27,221
Bye.

19
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,822
- Mrs. Yan?
- [Mrs.Yan] Yes, ma'am?

20
00:05:07,836 --> 00:05:09,713
Why isn’t this table properly skirted yet?

21
00:05:09,738 --> 00:05:12,783
The client’s coming,
you should finish this.

22
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,272
We’ll work on it, ma’am.

23
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:16,799
- This needs to get done now.
- Yes, ma’am.

24
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:25,118
Wait, why is the color
of the flowers like that?

25
00:05:25,143 --> 00:05:28,105
The client prefers light violet ones.

26
00:05:28,504 --> 00:05:31,215
Yes, ma’am, this is the closest color
to what we agreed on.

27
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,491
- You sure about that?
- Yes ma’am.

28
00:05:32,516 --> 00:05:35,394
If the client complains,
you’ll get blamed for it.

29
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,836
Sure. Yes, ma’am!

30
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,546
Sir, sir!

31
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:41,029
Please arrange the chairs, get on it.

32
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,854
Do these candles
have batteries already?

33
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:45,854
Have you fixed this?

34
00:05:46,183 --> 00:05:47,392
Please get it all done,

35
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:50,078
so everything’s prepared
for the client’s arrival.

36
00:05:50,363 --> 00:05:52,808
- Sound man!
- Yes, ma'am?

37
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:56,693
Is the music ready?

00:05:56,718 --> 00:05:58,136
Yes, ma’am, it’s all available.

39
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:00,913
The client likes R&B music, okay?

40
00:06:00,938 --> 00:06:02,440
Yes ma’am, we have it here.

41
00:06:17,226 --> 00:06:19,870
- Is this okay?
- Yes.

42
00:06:20,788 --> 00:06:22,998
- And…
- Yes?

43
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,302
I need you to carry something.

44
00:06:26,465 --> 00:06:28,717
- Alright.
- Can you come with me?

45
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:30,485
Sure. Where to?

46
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:34,544
- Over there. Just follow me.
- Okay.

47
00:10:47,768 --> 00:10:49,478
[Driver] Good evening, ma’am.

48
00:12:06,918 --> 00:12:08,536
Do you have a tissue?

49
00:12:08,684 --> 00:12:09,852
Yes, ma’am.

50
00:12:12,562 --> 00:12:13,581
Here.

51
00:12:45,618 --> 00:12:48,185
Can you park on
the side for a sec?

52
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,544
Sure.

53
00:12:57,474 --> 00:12:59,309
- Wait.
- What is it?

54
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:01,779
Watch me.

55
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:07,360
Can I have some tissues, ma’am?

56
00:15:13,004 --> 00:15:14,130
Thank you.

[shower running]

58
00:23:03,893 --> 00:23:06,229
Babe, come, let’s eat!

59
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:09,279
Join me. Quick, leave that for now.

60
00:23:09,731 --> 00:23:11,274
Just put that there.

61
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,436
I’ll get a plate.

62
00:23:17,447 --> 00:23:18,614
I’m good.

63
00:23:18,639 --> 00:23:20,266
- What?
- I’ll eat later.

64
00:23:20,511 --> 00:23:22,430
You sure? Why?

65
00:23:25,993 --> 00:23:27,474
Hey babe, are you alright?

66
00:23:28,637 --> 00:23:29,768
Are you zoning out?

67
00:23:31,435 --> 00:23:35,480
Babe, you know the unit
I posted on Facebook?

68
00:23:36,406 --> 00:23:39,056
I have a buyer already.
He’ll make a payment today.

69
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:45,212
Do you want to go shopping?
Or we can have a dinner date.

70
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:49,260
Oh, babe… just message me later,

71
00:23:49,623 --> 00:23:51,541
I might need to work.

72
00:23:52,238 --> 00:23:57,643
Okay, message me
when you’ve decided which restaurant.

73
00:23:57,668 --> 00:23:59,640
- Babe, hey!
- Yes, babe?

74
00:23:59,907 --> 00:24:01,200
Why do you look dazed?

75
00:24:01,577 --> 00:24:02,912
Just eat, babe.

76
00:24:02,937 --> 00:24:04,332
- You okay?
- Of course.

77
00:24:06,336 --> 00:24:07,879
Enjoy your food, babe.

78
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:36,393
Good, that’s good.

79
00:26:04,687 --> 00:26:05,647
Ma’am?

80
00:26:06,227 --> 00:26:07,520
Do you need anything?

81
00:26:07,545 --> 00:26:09,214
Can you go with me?

82
00:26:09,272 --> 00:26:10,316
Where?

83
00:26:10,341 --> 00:26:13,136
There are glasses
left in the bathroom.

84
00:26:13,161 --> 00:26:14,412
Alright, let’s go.

85
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:37,955
Where is it, ma’am?

86
00:30:45,981 --> 00:30:47,444
Babe, why are you late?

87
00:30:47,773 --> 00:30:51,163
I’ve been texting and calling
but you don’t answer.

88
00:30:52,563 --> 00:30:55,816
Babe, you know how my job is.

89
00:30:56,171 --> 00:30:59,839
It’s loud there, how was I supposed
to answer the phone?

90
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:05,034
So you didn’t bother to find a way?
I waited for you for so long.

91
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:50,142
You could’ve told me to reschedule
our dinner date tomorrow.

92
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:11,882
Can you give me a ride?

93
00:35:12,312 --> 00:35:14,683
Uh... Where do you
want to go, ma'am?

94
00:35:30,478 --> 00:35:31,604
Where should I take you, ma’am?

95
00:35:39,413 --> 00:35:40,497
Where?

96
00:38:03,627 --> 00:38:04,657
Meg!

97
00:38:05,268 --> 00:38:06,894
- Meg, who’s that man?
- Carlo?

98
00:38:06,919 --> 00:38:09,005
Damn you! Who’s this asshole?

99
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,552
Who’s this shit?

100
00:38:10,882 --> 00:38:12,759
- Bastard!
- Enough!

101
00:38:12,945 --> 00:38:14,529
Stop it, Carlo!

102
00:38:14,554 --> 00:38:15,931
- Damn you!
- Boss, stop! Boss!

103
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,812
- Enough!
- Don't touch me!

104
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,664
- Who’s he?
- Enough.

105
00:38:19,689 --> 00:38:20,690
You filthy slut!

106
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:21,992
Devil!

107
00:38:22,017 --> 00:38:23,096
Come here!

108
00:38:23,451 --> 00:38:25,245
Stop it.

109
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,099
- Come!
- Enough, Carlo.

110
00:38:27,124 --> 00:38:28,180
Keep walking!

111
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:30,971
Enough? After you fooled around?

112
00:38:30,996 --> 00:38:34,457
- You’ve been lying to my face?
- No! No!

113
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:36,922
Go there!

114
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:38,239
Bitch!

115
00:38:39,445 --> 00:38:40,655
You think I’m blind?

116
00:38:40,937 --> 00:38:41,937
Hmm?

117
00:38:42,247 --> 00:38:43,463
What do you mean it’s ‘nothing’?

118
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,771
What were you doing?

119
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,111
- I don’t know.
- You don’t know?

120
00:38:47,294 --> 00:38:48,837
I don’t know.

121
00:38:48,862 --> 00:38:52,074
Are you crazy?
Are you out of your goddamned mind?

122
00:38:52,266 --> 00:38:56,103
- You don’t understand what you’re doing?
- I really don't know why

123
00:38:56,956 --> 00:38:59,625
- You don’t know? You dirty whore!
- I don't know.

124
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,403
- I really don't know.
- Answer me! Damn pig!

125
00:39:02,428 --> 00:39:08,145
I don’t know what’s happening to me,
I don’t know what I’m doing!

126
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:12,304
- Make me understand then!
- I don’t know!

127
00:39:12,329 --> 00:39:13,664
What do you mean
you don’t know?

128
00:39:13,689 --> 00:39:16,566
- I don’t know!
- And in public too? Disgusting!

129
00:39:16,591 --> 00:39:18,254
I saw you doing it with him
with my own eyes!

130
00:39:19,548 --> 00:39:22,793
You piece of shit!
You’re revolting, you know that?

131
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:27,006
I didn’t want to do it,
but I had to!

132
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:30,259
You knew what you were doing!
How can you not know it?

133
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:33,220
- Babe!
- You hurt me!

134
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,608
I don’t know!

135
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:37,177
You’re disgusting! Sick bitch!

136
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,229
Shit!

137
00:39:39,725 --> 00:39:41,602
Damn you. I gave you everything!

138
00:39:41,627 --> 00:39:44,803
Have this. I’m leaving!
Damn whore!

139
00:39:50,854 --> 00:39:56,109
What's happening to me?
I can’t understand it.

140
00:39:56,736 --> 00:39:59,238
What's happening to me?

141
00:39:59,536 --> 00:40:01,805
I can’t go on like this.

142
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:04,949
I can’t bear this anymore.

143
00:40:05,391 --> 00:40:07,435
I'm so tired.

144
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:11,858
I don't want this.

145
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:26,113
I can’t bear this anymore.

146
00:41:35,779 --> 00:41:39,241
I don’t understand myself anymore…

147
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:43,324
What’s happening to me?

148
00:46:06,531 --> 00:46:11,495
Meg, what if you
get you checked?

149
00:46:11,983 --> 00:46:13,484
I will go with you.

150
00:46:17,031 --> 00:46:22,999
[Doctor] First of all,
thank you for being honest

151
00:46:23,024 --> 00:46:25,068
and courageous about your feelings.

152
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:28,756
That’s not easy.

153
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:35,983
What you’re going through
is not about being lustful, or immoral.

154
00:46:36,897 --> 00:46:38,774
This is a condition,

155
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:44,089
something that affects
your brain and emotion,

156
00:46:44,911 --> 00:46:46,254
and there’s help for it.

157
00:46:47,008 --> 00:46:50,512
The intense sexual urges
that you’re experiencing

158
00:46:51,328 --> 00:46:56,833
might be because of
some stress, trauma,

159
00:46:57,749 --> 00:47:01,586
or even emotional loneliness.

160
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,218
Something deeper.

161
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:07,043
We’re not here to judge.

162
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:10,115
We’re here to understand it

163
00:47:10,164 --> 00:47:13,542
and what you’re
describing can be treated.

164
00:47:13,567 --> 00:47:14,984
We have medicine for it.

165
00:47:15,506 --> 00:47:19,787
We’re going to manage your urges…

166
00:47:21,211 --> 00:47:24,005
without killing your
natural sexuality.

167
00:47:24,654 --> 00:47:25,867
Treatment plan…

168
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:29,029
recovery doesn’t mean
removing your sexuality.

169
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:31,426
It means making peace with it,

170
00:47:31,774 --> 00:47:35,427
so that it serves your joy,
not your shame.

171
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,271
This isn’t about your punishment.

172
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:40,495
It’s about healing,

173
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,526
emotionally,

174
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:49,769
psychologically and spiritually.

175
00:47:50,357 --> 00:47:52,020
You are not alone in this.

176
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:55,561
You will be helped.

177
00:48:24,771 --> 00:48:26,147
Don’t worry.

178
00:48:27,547 --> 00:48:30,981
We’ll face this together, okay?

179
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:21,753
Hello! How’s the food?

Thank you! Please enjoy!

00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:32,680
Hi, sir! How’s your food?
Is it okay?

182
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,495
[Waiter] There’s still a lot of

00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,941
we don’t have enough staff.

184
00:57:41,966 --> 00:57:46,179
We need to hire more
just in case, and…

185
00:57:59,354 --> 00:58:00,729
[Carlo] Let's go.
