1
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,000
To counter the threat of the rebel forces

2
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,560
The interior is implementing the Great Contraction Policy.

3
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,159
Will we, the children of serfs who just saw the light,

4
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,200
be thrown back into darkness again?

5
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,200
Didn't the PLA promise us before,

6
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,280
that we could study in school?

7
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,560
Are they abandoning us now?

8
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,560
Don't panic just yet.

9
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,599
Maybe things aren't as you think.

10
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,079
Sister.

11
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:17,959
Are we really going to be driven back?

12
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,439
Impossible.

13
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,680
Brother Gaoyuan said

14
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,439
the PLA came to liberate us.

15
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,239
But what if it's true?

16
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:27,159
Will we be driven back to the Balu Mansion?

17
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:28,040
Sister!

18
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,879
We'll be beaten to death!

19
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,560
If Lord Balu gets angry,

20
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,560
our lives will be miserable.

21
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:37,040
If I beg Young Master Yundan properly,

22
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,680
would he let us go?

23
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,000
Alright.

24
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,359
Stop imagining the worst.

25
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,000
Sister Yuling.

26
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,239
Is what they're saying true?

27
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,239
About the major contraction of work in Xizang?

28
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,079
It's true.

29
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,599
However,

30
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,000
while implementing the Great Contraction Policy,

31
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,199
the Tibet Work Committee

32
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,400
will not abandon Tibetan cadres and workers

33
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,080
and outstanding students.

34
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,719
The central government has decided

35
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,240
for Xizang to establish schools in the interior,

36
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,800
to cultivate talent

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,840
for Xizang's development.

38
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,800
A group of cadres has been selected from the army and local areas

39
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,840
to participate in the construction.

40
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,840
I am also involved.

41
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,639
Establishing schools in the interior,

42
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,479
building schools.

43
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,479
Is what you're saying true?

44
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,240
Please believe me, fellow students.

45
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,159
Every word I say

46
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,080
is true.

47
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,400
Furthermore,

48
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,280
the central government has notified us

49
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,400
that any Tibetan student willing to study in the interior

50
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,479
will be accepted without limit.

51
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,240
Those unwilling to come

52
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,479
will not be forced at all.

53
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,680
Xizang establishing its own schools in the interior,

54
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,680
thousands returning to the interior to study,

55
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,680
this is a great revolution for Xizang,

56
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,759
with profound historical significance.

57
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,680
So, are we going to study in a very faraway place?

58
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,080
To Battalion Commander Yi...

59
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,000
No,

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,840
he's Battalion Commander Yi now.

61
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,479
To his hometown,

62
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:14,039
Xianyang, Shaanxi, to study.

63
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,360
Then my sister and I

64
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,280
are both willing to go to Shaanxi with you to study.

65
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,080
Mm-hmm.

66
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,159
I really thought we were going to be abandoned.

67
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,240
Neither I personally,

68
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,800
nor the Party and the state,

69
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,280
will ever abandon you.

70
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,080
Sister Yuling.

71
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,400
I've memorized the entire human meridian chart.

72
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,199
I also heard Battalion Commander Yi say

73
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,319
Shaanxi has golden wheat and corn.

74
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,879
Made into steamed buns, they're delicious.

75
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,879
Mm-hmm.

76
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,159
When we get to Xianyang,

77
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,479
I'll treat you to as much as you want.

78
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,680
I want some too!

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,879
I only found out later

80
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,439
that Balu Yundan, in order to also go to Xianyang,

81
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,360
had a huge fight with his father.

82
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,639
He even smashed his favorite snuff bottle.

83
00:03:59,199 --> 00:03:59,759
Hello, Teacher Li.

84
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:00,280
Mm-hmm.

85
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,479
You remember what we learned yesterday, right?

86
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,280
Mm-hmm.

87
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:07,479
Are your things packed?

88
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,280
We're preparing to depart.

89
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,080
Mm-hmm.

90
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,240
Apart from this pen,

91
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,479
there's nothing else I need to bring.

92
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,560
Brother Gaoyuan!

93
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,280
You promised me before,

94
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,199
that when we get to Xianyang,

95
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,560
you'd take us to eat good food.

96
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,639
You'll have plenty to crave in Xianyang.

97
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,480
Young Master Balu.

98
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,680
I heard

99
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,639
that because of this matter,

100
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,079
you fell out with Lord Balu.

101
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,279
I didn't realize

102
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,839
you were so ambitious.

103
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,079
Suolang Renqing.

104
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,279
You were assigned by the Kashag Government, right?

105
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:35,839
What you plan to do,

106
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,680
I don't care.

107
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,639
I don't need a tralpa who married a noble lady

108
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,279
and forced his way into our noble circle

109
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,160
to give me advice.

110
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,279
Fellow students!

111
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,040
Let's depart!

112
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,480
Zhuoma.

113
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,680
Yundan has left.

114
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,240
My heart is in turmoil.

115
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,680
I want to talk to you.

116
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,160
Remember,

117
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,399
the year you left,

118
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,199
our little Yundan

119
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,560
cried his heart out.

120
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,680
He asked me,

121
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,600
"Where did Mama go?"

122
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,519
I promised you

123
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:23,079
to give him the best

124
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,000
and to protect him for life.

125
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,079
I've done that.

126
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,079
No one could have imagined

127
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,839
the situation would change so drastically.

128
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,639
I cannot disobey the Work Committee.

129
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,040
For his future,

130
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,079
I sent him away to study.

131
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,839
The sky over our Xizang

132
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,519
is also about to change.

133
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:51,560
I hope you in heaven

134
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,639
can protect our young eagle,

135
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,399
and let him fly safely.

136
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,439
On the road to Xianyang with Battalion Commander Yi,

137
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,519
a rainstorm lasted a full day and night.

138
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:06,040
The road was blocked by mudslides and landslides.

139
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,639
The soldiers assembled urgently,

140
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,879
attempting to clear the road.

141
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:16,480
Battalion Commander

142
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,279
Everyone's here.

143
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,360
Comrades,

144
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,839
The landslide ahead is severe.

145
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,120
From now on,

146
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,680
no students are allowed near it.

147
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:23,560
Yes, sir!

148
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,199
First Platoon Leader!

149
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:24,560
Here!

150
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,959
Organize a small assault team.

151
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,680
Take the path on the left side of the mountain.

152
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,439
Scout the situation on the opposite mountain.

153
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,040
The rest of First Platoon stays here.

154
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,240
Maintain order among the students.

155
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,240
Yes, sir!

156
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,199
Everyone from Second and Third Platoons,

157
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,160
follow me up the mountain.

158
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,079
We're going up the mountain

159
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,160
to clear away

160
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,040
all these fallen rocks.

161
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,720
Remember,

162
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,160
safety is paramount.

163
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,600
We must quickly

164
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,279
clear a path for vehicles.

165
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,279
Move out!

166
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,160
Yes, sir!

167
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,600
Teacher Li!

168
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,959
Teacher Li!

169
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,399
Battalion Commander Yi!

170
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,639
Battalion Commander Yi was hit by falling rocks.

171
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,759
He's unconscious.

172
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,279
Teacher Li,

173
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,560
Battalion Commander Yi is in your hands.

174
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,959
We'll keep rescuing the others.

175
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,759
Okay.

176
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:11,839
It's too cold.

177
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,279
We must keep his body temperature up.

178
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,240
Hypothermia after an injury is serious trouble.

179
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,160
Okay.

180
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,160
I'll go make some rice porridge.

181
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,000
Okay.

182
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,040
Compassionate White Tara,

183
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,240
if you can hear me,

184
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,560
I beg you to manifest your power once.

185
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:37,160
I will use all my future merit

186
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,399
to ensure Brother Gao Yuan wakes up.

187
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,040
I don't know if it was heaven's grace

188
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,680
or Tara's compassion,

189
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,839
but the moment I opened my eyes,

190
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,120
he was awake.

191
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,600
The flowers bloomed.

192
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:15,720
Alright.

193
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,680
Who knows the words above?

194
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,480
Sun Chen.

195
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:17,879
You try.

196
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,279
I'm not too sure.

197
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,439
Tashi Delek.

198
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:20,639
Hey.

199
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,439
Tashi Delek.

200
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,279
Hey.

201
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:23,560
I think

202
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,639
our Battalion Commander's head

203
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,399
after getting hit

204
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,439
is getting smarter and smarter.

205
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,040
No, hahaha!

206
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,800
I think

207
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,680
we should add a name to the credit list.

208
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,960
Look at Sister Meiduo, bringing soup and medicine every day.

209
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,559
She takes such meticulous care of him.

210
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,720
Right, right, right.

211
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,399
Battalion Commander,

212
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,559
Chen Tiezhu from our company

213
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,879
married Sister Drolma.

214
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:40,799
Li Changbo

215
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,240
is also with Sister Yangjin.

216
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,000
You're not getting any younger,

217
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,039
and you're still single.

218
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,879
This just isn't right, you know.

219
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:47,480
Hahaha!

220
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,159
Sun Chen,

221
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,440
I think you're itching for a beating.

222
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,159
You need to be taught a lesson.

223
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,440
Isn't that right?

224
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,559
Your Xizang language isn't great,

225
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,279
but you're a master at stirring up trouble.

226
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,080
Within ten minutes,

227
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,879
pack your gear

228
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,039
and get ready to assemble and move out.

229
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,240
We crossed countless snowy mountains,

230
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,679
forded countless rushing rivers.

231
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,279
We trekked all the way

232
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,480
and finally reached Xianyang.

233
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,879
So this is the hometown Brother Gao Yuan spoke of,

234
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:16,960
such a solid and warm land.

235
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,840
We're finally here.

236
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,879
So this is Brother Gao Yuan's hometown.

237
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:22,200
Tibetan Public School.

238
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,399
It's like entering another world.

239
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:26,759
Sister.

240
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:27,240
Hmm?

241
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,600
Do you think they have

242
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,480
things tastier than tsampa cakes here?

243
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,440
Student Meiduo.

244
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,759
Brother Gao Yuan!

245
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,399
I

246
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,639
specially brought some Shaanxi local products.

247
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:37,240
Liaohua candy.

248
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,080
Try some.

249
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,039
Okay.

250
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,679
Here, let me carry your luggage.

251
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,080
Hmm, I'll show you around.

252
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,639
Sister.

253
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:50,679
Why don't you make Brother Gao Yuan my brother-in-law?

254
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,039
We'd have good food for life.

255
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,240
Keep talking nonsense and I'll spank you.

256
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,080
It looks nice.

257
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,240
It's alright.

258
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,279
Hello, Teacher Li.

259
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,360
Hello, Teacher Li.

260
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,360
Teacher Li, Teacher Wang.

261
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,360
How is the students' ideological education work going lately?

262
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:25,480
There.

263
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:26,840
Thank you, Sister Yuling.

264
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,639
No problem.

265
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,279
Teacher Li, I want to braid my hair too.

266
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:30,279
Okay.

267
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,600
Let me see.

268
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,159
Ah.

269
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:40,440
Well, thank you for your hard work.

270
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,240
You carry on.

271
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,039
Brother Gao Yuan.

272
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,039
Student Meiduo.

273
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,840
You look

274
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,559
really beautiful today.

275
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:00,080
Sister Yuling

276
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,200
made this specially for me.

277
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:07,559
Hello, brother-in-law.
