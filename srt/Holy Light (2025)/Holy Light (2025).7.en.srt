1
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,439
Meiduo

2
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,399
This is more precious than anything.

3
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,439
Ah.

4
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:58,840
Come here.

5
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,159
Wen Li.

6
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,159
Let me introduce you.

7
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,719
This is Gesang Meiduo.

8
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:07,719
She is the only one in my heart.

9
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,200
And the person I will protect for my whole life.

10
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,239
Sorry.

11
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,120
I made you misunderstand.

12
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,760
So that's how it is.

13
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,519
Brother Gao Yuan, you are so fortunate.

14
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:22,959
Comrade Gesang Meiduo.

15
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:23,560
Hello.

16
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,120
Hello.

17
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,000
I wish you both well.

18
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,760
I'll be waiting for your wedding feast.

19
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,719
Thank you for your blessing.

20
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:30,239
Take care.

21
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:38,239
Meiduo.

22
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,760
I chose to put down roots in Xizang.

23
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,200
Partly because of the call of my ideals.

24
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,239
And partly...

25
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,560
because it is your homeland.

26
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,400
We have a shared goal.

27
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,400
I'll be waiting for you in Xizang.

28
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,000
Mm-hmm.

29
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,439
Brother Gao Yuan.

30
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,480
My heart has followed your footsteps.

31
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:10,400
You said putting down roots in Xizang was for your ideals...

32
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,599
and also for me.

33
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,240
I understand.

34
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,280
Without you...

35
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,400
without the People's Liberation Army...

36
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,319
Deji and I...

37
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,680
would still be talking livestock in the eyes of serf owners.

38
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,919
You gave me a new life.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,800
Let me taste liberation.

40
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,159
This taste is being able to breathe freely.

41
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,360
It's being able to strive for a shared tomorrow.

42
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,800
And being able to love someone openly and honestly.

43
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,360
Hey.

44
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,120
Hmm?

45
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,240
Let me ask you.

46
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,560
Why hasn't Balu Yundan come to class?

47
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,919
Today...

48
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,719
the sun rose from the west.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Why are you suddenly concerned about him?

50
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,560
I'm just asking.

51
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,120
He hasn't come to class, right?

52
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,319
As for us...

53
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,879
coming here from a plateau over 4,000 meters high...

54
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:29,599
it's inevitable many would have trouble acclimating.

55
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,960
And get sick because of it.

56
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,159
I heard...

57
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,719
Balu Yundan seems quite seriously ill.

58
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,000
He has tuberculosis.

59
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,599
Serves him right.

60
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,800
I'm a medical assistant now.

61
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,199
Responsible for caring for sick classmates.

62
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,560
But...

63
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,080
Are you trying to say...

64
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,360
if you should go see him?

65
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,520
Even though he...

66
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,800
changed a lot after coming to the Public School...

67
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,800
and hasn't bullied me again...

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,439
what he did before...

69
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,360
is unforgivable.

70
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,039
Just let him...

71
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:06,000
die from his illness and rot.

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,039
Well...

73
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,280
That's a bit much, isn't it?

74
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,000
I was just joking.

75
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,560
Don't take it seriously.

76
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,920
Cough, cough.

77
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,600
Deji, why are you here?

78
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,680
Teacher Yu Ling sent me to treat you.

79
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,839
You...

80
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,279
Are you willing to let me give you a shot?

81
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,399
Willing.

82
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,800
You can give it however you like.

83
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,759
You said it.

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,800
Mm-hmm.

85
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,319
Take off your clothes.

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,360
I'm still sick...

87
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:53,839
That...

88
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,600
isn't really appropriate.

89
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,360
Just take them off when told.

90
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,600
Close the door, close it!

91
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,160
Sit down.

92
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,519
Ah!

93
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,759
Sit down.

94
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,120
Teacher Yu Ling said...

95
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,199
a butt shot works best.

96
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,000
A butt shot?

97
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,000
Go over there.

98
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,720
Hold him down.

99
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,480
Deji.

100
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,000
Why did you come to save me?

101
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,079
Because it's a doctor's duty.

102
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,120
And also because...

103
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,800
you saved candy for me when we were kids.

104
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,199
You even got whipped by your father for it.

105
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,959
You still remember something so long ago?

106
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,160
Deji.

107
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,399
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,680
I did many bad things before.

109
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,319
You are so kind...

110
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,680
and still treat my illness.

111
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,399
Thank you.

112
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,000
Forgive me.

113
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,680
Who said I forgive you?

114
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,920
I haven't forgiven you.

115
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,000
Well, well.

116
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,519
You lowly hereditary serf.

117
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,000
How dare you enter our noble young master's room?

118
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,480
What?

119
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,279
Climbing up to Young Master Yundan?

120
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,920
Wanting to be the young mistress?

121
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,360
Sangguo Jiamei!

122
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,920
Deji is here to help treat my illness.

123
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,160
Apologize to her quickly.

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,600
I don't need their apology.

125
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,600
I was born a hereditary serf.

126
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,360
But now, I am the same as you.

127
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,199
I am a student of the Tibetan Public School.

128
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,600
We are equal.

129
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,759
I came to care for a sick classmate.

130
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,560
You are his friends.

131
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,920
Yet you mock the person helping him here.

132
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,920
Are you even human?

133
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,920
Deji.

134
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,680
Fellow students.

135
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,279
Today is a special day.

136
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,920
Student Balu Yundan will here...

137
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:31,040
offer to Gesang Meiduo...

138
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,879
and the Gesang Deji sisters...

139
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,079
his most sincere apology from the heart.

140
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,759
Respected

141
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,120
Gesang Meiduo

142
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,759
and fellow student Gesang Deji,

143
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,519
In the past,

144
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,560
there was much unpleasantness between us.

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,519
It also had a negative impact on the school.

146
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,000
Today, I want to tell you,

147
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:14,879
and tell everyone,

148
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,959
I reflect on it every day.

149
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,399
I have deeply realized my mistakes.

150
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,399
I wish to express three points of sincerity.

151
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,519
First,

152
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,120
Regardless of whether we were masters

153
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,199
or servants in the past,

154
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,519
but now,

155
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,720
we are classmates,

156
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,679
friends,

157
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,879
and equals.

158
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,600
Second,

159
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,519
I want to learn from you.

160
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,679
To learn from Gesang Meiduo's

161
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,720
positive progressiveness.

162
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,279
To learn from Gesang Deji's

163
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,320
kindness and tolerance.

164
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,480
To learn from the activists'

165
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,600
endurance of hardship,

166
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,679
diligence in study,

167
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,720
and helpful spirit.

168
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,559
I will completely abandon old thoughts and ways of life.

169
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,440
Third,

170
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,399
I hope you can accept my apology.

171
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,399
I want to become good classmates

172
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,399
and good friends with you.

173
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,279
Fine words alone are not enough.

174
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,080
I will prove my resolve through action.

175
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,320
Please watch my future conduct.

176
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,279
Respected fellow student Gesang Deji,

177
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:37,440
This Khata represents my respect

178
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,159
and my apology to you.

179
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,480
Please accept my apology.
