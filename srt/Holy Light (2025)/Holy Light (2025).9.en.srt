1
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,399
Get out.

2
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,680
Get out!

3
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,200
Deji.

4
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:12,000
What do you want now?

5
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,599
I worked all day today.

6
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,560
My hands are raw and bleeding.

7
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,319
And I reek of manure.

8
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,200
Just now, I fought fiercely

9
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,959
with my lifelong friend over prejudice.

10
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,519
Only now do I realize

11
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,480
what kind of life you lived

12
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,879
back at the Balu estate.

13
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:29,280
What kind of suffering you endured.

14
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:34,760
Deji.

15
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,439
I used to think

16
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:37,719
that I liked you.

17
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,799
Now I see how much of a jerk I was.

18
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,120
I liked you as if you were a thing.

19
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,599
Like how one admires

20
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,599
a beautiful antelope.

21
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:53,599
I never saw you as an equal person.

22
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,799
After going through all this,

23
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,359
I now understand

24
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,159
what equality is.

25
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,000
And what true affection really is.

26
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,319
Deji.

27
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:21,400
Gongba Mocuo (I'm sorry).

28
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,000
Gongba Mocuo (I'm sorry).

29
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,120
Brother Gao Yuan.

30
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,800
Even though my hatred for Balu Yundan

31
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,000
was once heavier than the snow mountains,

32
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,680
I still forgave him.

33
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:48,400
After all, successfully reforming him

34
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,000
will be a huge shock to other noble youths.

35
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
The significance is profound.

36
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,560
But as Balu Yundan and Deji grow closer,

37
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,560
asking me to agree to them being together...

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,879
I can't do it.

39
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,080
I don't believe

40
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,919
that a former young master,

41
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:03,120
who had everything served to him,

42
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,800
can truly bend his back to do hard labor.

43
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,240
What if

44
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,400
this is just an act to deceive Deji?

45
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,479
Deji.

46
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,960
What are you doing?

47
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:36,960
What's wrong?

48
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,199
Sister.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,520
I saw the letter you wrote to Battalion Commander Yi.

50
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,360
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,879
Are you angry, Sister?

52
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,560
Sister isn't angry.

53
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,280
I've been doubting

54
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,000
Balu Yundan's sincerity towards you.

55
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,479
But today, seeing him work hard

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
and protect you so fiercely

57
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,199
when you were bullied...

58
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:09,840
I think

59
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,800
he must genuinely like you.

60
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,360
Well, I don't necessarily like him either.

61
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,600
Our little Deji has really grown up.

62
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,879
Whether you like him or not,

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,800
Sister won't stand in your way.

64
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,800
If he can truly reform himself,

65
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,360
Sister respects your choice.

66
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,360
Sister.

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,920
You're so good to me.

68
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:37,920
Sister.

69
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,160
Hmm?

70
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:39,879
You've worked hard.

71
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,480
Put me down!

72
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,879
Sister, have mercy!

73
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,399
March, 1959.

74
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:59,560
The reactionary upper-class clique in Xizang

75
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,079
openly violated the Seventeen-Point Agreement,

76
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,279
launching a full-scale armed rebellion

77
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,319
in an attempt to split the motherland.

78
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,240
The Chinese People's Liberation Army was ordered to suppress the rebellion,

79
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,480
safeguarding national unity and the fundamental interests

80
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,879
of all ethnic groups in Xizang.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,800
Balu Yundan.

82
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,920
What are you doing?

83
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,759
I'm not staying at the Tibetan Public School.

84
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,360
Why won't they let former noble youths go to Xizang to help suppress the rebellion?

85
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,519
I want to go back and persuade my father.

86
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,480
Is there a problem?

87
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,519
Then where will you go?

88
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,199
An eagle will not build its nest

89
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,480
on a cliff that despises it.

90
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,199
My path

91
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,560
lies where the clouds drift.

92
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,120
It's none of your concern.

93
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,639
Hear me out first.

94
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,600
Then you can leave.

95
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,600
I know your heart is with your homeland

96
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,680
and with your father.

97
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,519
You want to go back to join the suppression

98
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,920
and the Democratic Reform.

99
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,519
We understand this sentiment.

100
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,079
Then why won't you let me go back?

101
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,319
Precisely because you are a highland eagle,

102
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,519
we must protect your wings.

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,959
The organization isn't sending students of noble birth

104
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,279
or those under eighteen

105
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,319
back at this time.

106
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,360
It's not that we don't trust you.

107
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,720
It's because we fear you might get hurt.

108
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,720
As long as your hearts are towards the light,

109
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,160
and you don't participate in the rebellion,

110
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,000
you are safe here

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,120
at the Tibetan Public School.

112
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,399
You are protected.

113
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,560
Furthermore,

114
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,800
staying at school

115
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,079
also allows you to contribute to the suppression and reform.

116
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,480
Your wings are your own.

117
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,319
If you insist on leaving,

118
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:24,920
I can't stop you.

119
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,199
But before you go,

120
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,759
you should think about

121
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,720
why you crossed mountains to come here in the first place.

122
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,600
Think about who you truly want to protect.

123
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,920
It is precisely for Deji's sake

124
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,759
that I must go back.

125
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,639
In Xizang,

126
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,480
serf owners and serfs

127
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,279
are like heaven

128
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,079
and earth.

129
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,160
Only by spreading the idea of equality for all

130
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,759
to every Tibetan person

131
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,480
will Deji and I

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,920
have a chance.

133
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,160
Besides, I already wrote to my father,

134
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:21,000
telling him to see the situation clearly

135
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,000
and support the reform.

136
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,720
Good.

137
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,279
Then keep writing letters.

138
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,279
Tell your family everything

139
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,360
you've seen and learned here in the interior.

140
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,720
Only then

141
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,759
will the new Xizang we wish to see

142
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,480
arrive sooner.

143
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,560
Comrade Balu Yundan,

144
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,319
I can help deliver your letters.

145
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,000
In the past

146
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,560
Hatred coiled in my heart like a venomous snake.

147
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,279
But today

148
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,560
I saw your desire to return to Xizang to quell the rebellion

149
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,879
and your heart set on persuading reform.

150
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:05,680
It's as sincere and bright as sunlight on a snowy mountain.

151
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,000
Only then did I realize

152
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,759
that I was blinded by the shadows of the past.

153
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,319
Classmate Balu Yundan,

154
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,759
please forgive my narrow-mindedness.

155
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,800
In truth, when I fell gravely ill

156
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,519
and Deji came to care for me,

157
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
I completely abandoned the idea of being a young master.

158
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:28,480
I want to be a true person,

159
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,920
a person just like all of you.

160
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,959
From today onward,

161
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,159
we are true classmates

162
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:38,480
and comrades fighting side by side for Xizang's tomorrow.

163
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:50,679
Deji,

164
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,919
I'm returning to Xizang soon.

165
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,960
You must take good care of yourself at school.

166
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:01,200
Don't worry, Sister.

167
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,360
My heart holds you, Sister,

168
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,320
and also holds our Xizang folks.

169
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,759
That's why I must quickly master medicine,

170
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,159
just like you, Sister,

171
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,879
to become someone useful to our homeland.

172
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,600
On this return to Xizang,

173
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:14,360
will you see Brother Gao Yuan?

174
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,200
Mm-hmm.

175
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,480
The snowy mountains

176
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,879
and the sacred lake

177
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,600
will surely guide us to meet.

178
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,960
See you in Xizang.

179
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,559
Crossing the final mountain,

180
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,200
Nedong County is right before our eyes.

181
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:38,399
Brother Gao Yuan,

182
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,600
Can the wind here hear my heartbeat?

183
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:43,399
Each beat is calling your name.

184
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:45,759
Mm.

185
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,320
Meiduo,

186
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,279
Look.

187
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,159
Nedong County is right ahead.

188
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,919
Brother Gao Yuan is right there.

189
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,440
You must be overjoyed, darn it.

190
