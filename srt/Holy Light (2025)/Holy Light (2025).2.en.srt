1
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,159
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:56,119
I didn't mean to steal.

3
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,959
I did mean to steal.

4
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:06,319
Please punish me.

5
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,719
Were you going to give it to your sister?

6
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,120
Don't worry.

7
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,359
We'll take good care of your sister.

8
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,280
But first,

9
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,359
you need to take care of yourself.

10
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:26,480
You must be hungry too.

11
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,480
Eat.

12
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,760
Once you're full,

13
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,359
you'll have the strength to care for your sister.

14
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,319
Master Yi.

15
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,879
Meiduo.

16
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:58,680
What are you doing?

17
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,640
What are you doing?

18
00:01:59,640 --> 00:01:59,840
Get up, quickly.

19
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,280
Listen to me.

20
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,959
Master Yi.

21
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:04,519
I sneaked over here.

22
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,760
I want to thank you for saving my life.

23
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,120
We are household serfs.

24
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,120
What you Han people call slaves.

25
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,560
From the moment we're born,

26
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:18,240
our bodies and our lives

27
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,479
are not our own.

28
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,199
We're bought like livestock,

29
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:24,919
sold,

30
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,319
and abused.

31
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:32,360
We can only live like rats in a hole,

32
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,039
hiding

33
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:34,840
and enduring.

34
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,120
You rescued us from hell.

35
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,719
Meiduo.

36
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,960
Meiduo has nothing to repay your kindness.

37
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,039
I can only...

38
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,560
I can only give myself to you.

39
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,919
From now on,

40
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,960
Meiduo is yours.

41
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,159
You are Meiduo's master.

42
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,560
Meiduo.

43
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,639
I didn't save you.

44
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,319
You chose to bravely escape yourself.

45
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,719
You saved yourself.

46
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,840
But since you've joined the Liberation Army,

47
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,840
there are new rules now.

48
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,639
Come on.

49
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,240
Get up first.

50
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,960
You must remember this,

51
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,520
engrave it in your heart.

52
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,240
First,

53
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,879
don't kneel to people casually.

54
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,960
Everyone has a head on their shoulders.

55
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,439
Everyone is equal.

56
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,879
Second,

57
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,960
You are not a yak,

58
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,120
not a silver coin,

59
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,319
nor an object to be bought and sold.

60
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:50,919
You are a person.

61
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,439
You don't belong to anyone.

62
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,159
You belong only to yourself.

63
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,280
Do you understand?

64
00:03:59,159 --> 00:03:59,960
Master Yi.

65
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,759
I know you have a kind heart

66
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,439
and won't accept me.

67
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,759
But Meiduo's heart has already acknowledged its master.

68
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,599
Meiduo.

69
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,319
Listen carefully.

70
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,960
Don't call me Master Yi.

71
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,039
You can call me Company Commander Yi,

72
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,279
or you can call me

73
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,399
Brother Gao Yuan.

74
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,480
It's not that I won't take you.

75
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,879
It's that you have nothing to give.

76
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,879
Those slave owners used whips and chains to tell you

77
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,319
that you are their property.

78
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,680
But that's false.

79
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,279
It's a man-eating lie.

80
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,560
Now you are free.

81
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,639
Your body,

82
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,240
soul,

83
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:34,959
will,

84
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,000
and future...

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,959
From today onward,

86
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:39,120
belong completely and only to yourself.

87
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,560
Do you understand?

88
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,279
Come.

89
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,560
Look.

90
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,360
That eagle in the sky,

91
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,199
does it belong to any cloud?

92
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,319
It belongs only to its own wings.

93
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,360
And Meiduo...

94
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,920
also belongs only to Meiduo herself.

95
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,079
Meiduo

96
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,959
belongs to Meiduo herself.

97
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,800
At that moment,

98
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,560
it was as if a crack opened in her heart,

99
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,519
and a light shone in.

100
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,680
Gesang Meiduo

101
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,560
belongs only to Gesang Meiduo herself.

102
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,279
Don't come any closer!

103
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,439
Give me back my sister!

104
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,120
Don't come over!

105
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,160
Don't come over!

106
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:25,959
Don't come over!

107
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:26,160
Don't come over!

108
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,839
Don't be afraid.

109
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,680
Let us explain.

110
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,279
Where is my sister?

111
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,600
Deji!

112
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,639
Sister is here.

113
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,240
Sister!

114
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,079
What happened?

115
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,439
Company Commander Yi.

116
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,639
I went to give her the shoes.

117
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,360
But then...

118
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,439
she saw me and ran.

119
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,720
She ran, so I chased.

120
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,839
She looked at me

121
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,879
like I was a devil.

122
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,079
Am I that scary?

123
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:45,879
Sister!

124
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:48,040
I thought you went to find food

125
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,480
and they caught you.

126
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,560
I was afraid they'd beat you,

127
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,720
skin you alive.

128
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,399
I heard...

129
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,639
I heard many people say

130
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,120
the Red Han people are Red Devils.

131
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,759
They eat people without spitting out the bones.

132
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,600
Red Devils?

133
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,560
Would they give us tsampa to eat?

134
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,879
Give us milk to drink,

135
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,759
and new shoes to wear?

136
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,759
Do you remember,

137
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:09,040
when we worked at Balu Manor,

138
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,480
those girls in uniforms who were singing?

139
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,560
Mm-hmm.

140
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:15,839
Sister.

141
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:18,040
Then they are the same as those girls.

142
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,959
They are all...

143
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,560
We are all Liberation Army soldiers.

144
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,120
Not man-eating Red Devils.

145
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,959
But you look so fierce,

146
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,480
not like a good person.

147
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:26,959
I...

148
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,959
Ha ha ha!

149
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,360
What are you laughing at? Get back to work!

150
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,959
Go on!

151
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,560
How are you?

152
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,319
Feeling better?

153
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:56,959
Doctor Li.

154
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:57,439
Battalion Commander.

155
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:59,079
That soldier fainted.

156
00:06:59,079 --> 00:06:59,879
Let's go check on him.

157
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:00,680
Okay.

158
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,959
Hey.

159
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,319
Deji.

160
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,120
What are you doing here?

161
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,959
Brother Gao Yuan.

162
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,920
Ah.

163
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,319
Please, sit.

164
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,319
I'll sit.

165
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,079
You are...

166
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,360
Let me give you an injection.

167
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:22,920
Hold on.

168
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,399
How many days have you been

169
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,319
learning from Doctor Li?

170
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,120
Hmm.

171
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,519
I've practiced many times.

172
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,480
Just one shot.

173
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,920
Let me try.

174
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:36,079
Go learn from Doctor Li for a few more days,

175
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,000
then you can inject me.

176
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,040
Just one shot.

177
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,839
Brother Gao Yuan.

178
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,519
How about this.

179
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,800
I'll find Zhuzi for you

180
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,560
to practice on.

181
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:46,800
No, no.

182
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,519
Don't.

183
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,040
Zhuzi!

184
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,279
Zhuzi!

185
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,160
Come here, quick!

186
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,279
Uh...

187
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,439
Let Comrade Deji

188
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,439
give you a couple of shots.

189
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,240
I'm not sick, why would you inject me?

190
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,560
Then call, call, call Sun Chen.

191
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,879
I'll inject you.

192
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:00,319
Sun Chen!

193
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:00,680
I'll inject you.

194
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,480
Sun Chen!

195
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:02,720
Where's Sun Chen?

196
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,680
I'll inject you, Brother Gao Yuan.

197
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,959
Let's go.

198
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,600
Zhuzi!

199
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,920
Hurry up!

200
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,560
Don't slack off.

201
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,839
Brother Gao Yuan.

202
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,439
You've worked hard.

203
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,240
Have some water.

204
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,919
Miss Meiduo.

205
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,960
Thank you.

206
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,879
The weather is too hot.

207
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,080
Let me wipe your sweat.

208
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,879
Ah.

209
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,080
No, no need.

210
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,120
I can do it myself.

211
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,159
Did I do something wrong?

212
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,080
No, no, not at all.

213
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,919
Your face is so red.

214
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,759
Why are you so hot?

215
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,159
This weather, I tell you...

216
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:59,159
If only it would rain.

217
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,720
Yeah, that's true.

218
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,960
It's too hot.

219
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,159
Uh...

220
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,360
Miss Meiduo.

221
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,559
Let me show you something fun.

222
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,840
Look.

223
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,559
This is called

224
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,360
a harmonica.

225
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,519
Don't let its size fool you.

226
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,240
It can play many different tunes.

227
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,399
Really?

228
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,039
Ah.

229
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,360
I'll play it for you.

230
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:21,559
Okay.

231
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,639
Let's go.

232
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,159
Brother Gao Yuan

233
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,639
was playing an instrument I'd never seen before.

234
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,519
The melody was also unfamiliar.

235
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,440
But those notes,

236
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,679
falling into my ears,

237
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,039
were like a key

238
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,960
suddenly unlocking the cage that had trapped me all my life.

239
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,799
I was still standing on this plateau,

240
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,559
yet it felt like I had stepped into another world.

241
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:04,840
Sister.

242
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,159
The Liberation Army really is good.

243
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:08,879
Everyone treats me very well.

244
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,440
They give me lots of candy.

245
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:12,840
Sister.

246
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,960
I want to follow Doctor Li Yuling

247
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,759
and learn how to give injections.

248
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:17,960
Of course.

249
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,000
Whatever you want to do,

250
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
your sister supports you.

251
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,639
But our little Deji,

252
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:23,639
your head is a bit slow.

253
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:25,480
You'll have to study hard.

254
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,840
Deji is not slow!

255
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,440
I'll go find Doctor Li right now

256
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,360
to learn injections.

257
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:31,720
Hmph!

258
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,480
Brother Gao Yuan.

259
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,039
Meiduo.

260
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,720
I have good news for you.

261
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,000
The Xizang Work Committee

262
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,559
and the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region

263
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,840
have decided to select a group of outstanding Tibetan youth

264
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,960
to work in various units.

265
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,159
You and Deji

266
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,279
both have the opportunity

267
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:49,480
to enter the Cadre School for study.

268
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,919
Will we still get to see you if we go?

269
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:55,440
Yes.

270
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,039
I'll have the chance

271
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,080
to visit you.

272
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,480
This is a small token of my appreciation.

273
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,919
For you.

274
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,519
Alright then.

275
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,000
Thank you, sir.

276
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,679
Let me teach you.

277
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:17,039
Come here.

278
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,639
Upper arm leads the forearm.

279
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,360
Start from the chest.

280
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:20,879
Try it.

281
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,519
Mm-hmm.

282
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,320
That's right.
