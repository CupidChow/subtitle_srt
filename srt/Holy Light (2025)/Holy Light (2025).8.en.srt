1
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,479
Brother Gao Yuan

2
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:55,039
I received your letter.

3
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,840
I can't tell you how happy I am.

4
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,759
Through this thin piece of paper,

5
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,159
I know that thousands of miles away,

6
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,920
Brother Gao Yuan is concerned about me

7
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,039
and encouraging me.

8
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:06,599
Meiduo,

9
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,959
I often wonder

10
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,719
how you're doing at school.

11
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,920
Can you adapt to life there?

12
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,640
I hope my letter

13
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,480
brings you some warmth and strength.

14
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,959
I know you've been trying hard.

15
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,640
You must believe in yourself.

16
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:22,519
You will definitely learn new things

17
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,079
and lay a solid foundation

18
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,040
for working back in Xizang.

19
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,959
I'm very used to my studies now.

20
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,680
I like the labor classes best.

21
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,239
Here I've learned to fertilize,

22
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,560
learned to make soap,

23
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,359
and many other skills.

24
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,640
The academic classes are tough,

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
but I'm not afraid.

26
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,319
I understand.

27
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,040
Knowledge is like a desert spring;

28
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,879
the deeper you dig, the sweeter it gets.

29
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:51,640
But one thing troubles me.

30
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,760
Balu Yundan apologized publicly to me and Deji.

31
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,319
He's changed a lot.

32
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,200
And,

33
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,879
I think he likes Deji.

34
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,759
I miss you every day.

35
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,280
I long to return to Xizang sooner,

36
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,759
to work with you,

37
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,520
and to keep learning from you.

38
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,240
You must wait for me.

39
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:27,840
Don't be afraid, Sister.

40
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,439
Dr. Li is here.

41
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,319
What are you doing here?

42
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,280
It's a breech birth.

43
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,159
It's very dangerous.

44
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,639
We must go to the hospital immediately.

45
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,400
Deji,

46
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,159
go get help!

47
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:37,759
Hurry!

48
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:40,879
We can't go.

49
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,159
We can't go to the hospital.

50
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:42,879
Renqing!

51
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,840
Are you crazy?

52
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,280
Dr. Li says

53
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,759
Sister is in great danger.

54
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,960
What are you hesitating for?

55
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,360
It'll be too late if we wait any longer!

56
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,439
We can't go to the hospital.

57
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,240
A woman giving birth is the most unclean,

58
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,319
the most offensive to the gods.

59
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,639
Going to the hospital now

60
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,680
will anger the spirits.

61
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,400
We can't go.

62
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,039
We won't go to the hospital.

63
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,639
We'll deliver at home.

64
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,560
We'll deliver at home.

65
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,719
You're too stubborn!

66
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,960
You're harming her like this.

67
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,240
For a woman giving birth,

68
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,280
it's crossing the brink of death.

69
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,360
She can only rely on the gods

70
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,319
and her own fate.

71
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,360
Going to the hospital now

72
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,840
will only bring greater disaster.

73
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,599
Renqing,

74
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,479
The reverence for the gods you speak of,

75
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,240
the Tibetan customs,

76
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,960
I understand them all.

77
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,680
They are things carved into the bones of us Tibetans.

78
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,120
But look at Sister.

79
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,719
Think carefully.

80
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:23,319
What is Sister Cuomu's status?

81
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,080
She is the noble daughter of the Wuse family,

82
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,560
a pearl of the grassland.

83
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,759
And you,

84
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,879
are just a poor, former monk.

85
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,680
She defied her family's opposition,

86
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,840
dared to violate rules heavier than mountains,

87
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,960
and insisted on marrying you.

88
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,840
Back then,

89
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,280
weren't you afraid of bad luck?

90
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,680
Weren't you afraid of angering the gods?

91
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,280
She is now struggling between life and death.

92
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,919
She broke with tradition for you.

93
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,120
She bears children for you.

94
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,280
She bears children for you.

95
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,039
And you,

96
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:48,120
think childbirth is the filthiest thing.

97
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:51,960
If you ask me,

98
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,520
Sister Cuomu really married the wrong man.

99
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:54,759
Brother Renqing,

100
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,759
if you don't decide now,

101
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,240
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

102
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:00,719
To the hospital!

103
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
Go get help, quick!

104
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,479
I've already thought of a name for the child.

105
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,839
Yang Jinhua.

106
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,120
Yang Jinhua.

107
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,519
You really gave the child a Han Chinese name?

108
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,120
And with Dr. Yang's surname?

109
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,480
Yes, Meiduo.

110
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,079
Without Dr. Yang,

111
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,639
neither Jinhua nor I would be alive.

112
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,759
This name

113
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,319
is for the child to forever remember her savior.

114
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,120
And to remember the light brought by Jin Zhu Ma Mi.

115
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,439
We also want to thank you

116
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,279
for opening my eyes.

117
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,560
Hearing you say that

118
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,560
makes all our hardship worthwhile.

119
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,720
You've cared for us like a real sister.

120
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:48,360
I'd like Jinhua to have you as her godmother, okay?

121
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,839
That's wonderful news!

122
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,560
Our Meiduo as a godmother

123
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,759
will surely be the best godmother under heaven.

124
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,959
Suolang Renqing,

125
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,240
you must take extra good care of mother and daughter.

126
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:59,319
Otherwise, our Meiduo won't stand for it.

127
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,199
Absolutely.

128
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:00,879
Meiduo,

129
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,120
please also supervise me.

130
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,439
Okay.

131
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,800
Then I'll

132
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,839
be the child's godmother.

133
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,160
Little Jinhua,

134
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,720
from now on I'm your godmother.

135
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,160
You are my little goddaughter.

136
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,319
Brother Gao Yuan

137
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,319
I used to think I was just a Gesang seed

138
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,839
That only sprouted when blown into your palm

139
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,879
But this time

140
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,480
I forced Suolang Renqing

141
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,480
To break old rules and save his wife and child

142
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,040
I realized I too can be a boat to carry others

143
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,720
Also, I have good news

144
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:39,920
I'm a godmother now

145
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,759
When little Jinhua's hand grasped mine

146
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,360
The warmth was hotter in my heart than sunlit Mount Kailash

147
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,920
Kiss the wind by the Lhasa River for me

148
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,120
In the future

149
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,519
I'll stand with you atop the eastern hill

150
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,000
And scatter the seeds of freedom

151
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,519
Across every cattle shed

152
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,720
My little Gesang boat

153
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,800
Outside the outpost

154
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,839
The wind howls

155
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,160
But the Lhasa River

156
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,959
Hears the sound of you breaking waves

157
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,360
I am so glad

158
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:24,040
That the little boat saved that day

159
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:26,639
Now carries new life across the river

160
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,319
Last night, passing a Mani pile

161
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,959
I placed a white stone

162
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,240
For little Jinhua

163
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,839
The day you enter Xizang

164
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,639
I will hold tight

165
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,079
That brave girl

166
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,560
Who crashed into my arms

167
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,720
The paper is short, but my feelings are long

168
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:42,040
The paper is thin, but my longing is deep

169
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,720
Kissing you a thousand times

170
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,720
On the day you return to Xizang

171
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,680
Together, we will plant freedom

172
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,160
On the eastern hilltop

173
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,959
Students

174
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,560
In response to the national call

175
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,639
To be able to rise and to descend

176
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,319
To serve as officials or as common people

177
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,079
The Tibetan Public School has decided

178
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:59,519
To move the classroom to the fields

179
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,560
For training in Dijiaogou Village

180
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,319
Every student

181
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:06,360
Must master a practical production skill

182
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,680
Now announcing the pairing-up list

183
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:13,240
Gesang Meiduo, Balu Yundan

184
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,360
Basang Ciren

185
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,000
Sangguo Jiamei

186
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,439
Gesang Deji

187
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,160
Nima

188
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,319
Pairing up is not a formality

189
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,480
It is a responsibility

190
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,439
It is a test

191
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,959
Students must change their mindset

192
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,160
Put aside your airs

193
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,319
Be reborn through labor

194
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,639
Now

195
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,319
Each group, according to assignment

196
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,319
Begin work

197
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,480
Yundan

198
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:49,920
Should I talk to Teacher Li Yuling

199
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,120
To change your pairing?

200
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,639
I'll use real action to change their view of me

201
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,160
What is this stuff?

202
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,519
Manure

203
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,120
Today's task

204
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,959
Is to spread this fertilizer on the land

205
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,560
This is downright humiliating

206
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,319
They're just toying with Balu Yundan

207
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,720
How dare they!

208
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,439
I didn't mean to

209
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,120
Young master of the Balu estate

210
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,839
For a little serf like Deji

211
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,839
You've even thrown away your dignity

212
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:22,959
Balu Yundan

213
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,839
If you can't take it

214
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,120
You can file a report

215
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,600
Go back to Xizang and be your Balu young master

216
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,720
Look at our young master Yundan

217
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,720
This posture

218
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,720
Is even better looking

219
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,559
Than dancing the Langma Dui

220
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,159
Ha ha ha!

221
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:02,840
Well done

222
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,039
We can't let that little hussy Deji

223
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,519
Make our Kashag and noble class a joke

224
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,159
What are you doing?

225
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,519
What potion did you give young master Balu?

226
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,799
What do you...

227
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,039
What are you doing?

228
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:20,679
What are you doing?!

229
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,399
Stop!

230
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,159
Jerk!

231
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,120
For a lowly serf

232
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,360
You'd really raise a hand against your brothers?

233
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,960
They are not serfs anymore

234
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,960
They are classmates

235
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,240
They are friends

236
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,679
She is the one I've always liked

237
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,919
Since we were children

238
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,440
If any of you dare bully her again

239
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,840
You'll have a problem with me

240
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:49,639
Stop it!

241
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,919
If you don't stop, I'll call Teacher Li and security

242
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:54,000
You three will be waiting to be expelled
