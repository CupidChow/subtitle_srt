1
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,359
Dried tangerine peel candy from Sister Yuling

2
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,079
Milk candy from Squad Leader Sun

3
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,280
Sister... Mhm.

4
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,679
Are we really going to the Cadre School?

5
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,719
Don't you want to go?

6
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:07,959
Here, if you get hurt, there's medicine.

7
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,920
If you're cold, there are quilts.

8
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:12,359
And lots of candy to eat.

9
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:16,200
I'm afraid of meeting bad people in a new place.

10
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,920
Isn't it pretty good for us here?

11
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,159
Back at the Balu Mansion,

12
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,879
we also thought it was okay.

13
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,599
If the moldy bread had no maggots, it was edible.

14
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:28,519
If the whip didn't break bones,

15
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,400
we considered ourselves lucky.

16
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,959
But here is different.

17
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,120
How can you compare this to the Balu Mansion?

18
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,319
It is different.

19
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,920
Because the People's Liberation Army

20
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,719
has shown us

21
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,040
that people can live standing tall.

22
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,200
Don't you want to learn to write,

23
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,719
learn to read,

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,560
and become as capable as Brother Gao Yuan

25
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,799
and Sister Yuling?

26
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,400
They are all so capable.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,760
I can't do it, Sister.

28
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,799
If I just learn a little bit about acupuncture,

29
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,280
I'll feel that's enough.

30
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:05,319
Before, at the Balu Mansion,

31
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,719
we were lambs waiting to be slaughtered.

32
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,879
Because we escaped,

33
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,240
we became people.

34
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,280
The next step

35
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,759
is to master skills,

36
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:16,000
so we no longer live relying on others' help.

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,879
Only then can we become true,

38
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,599
independent people who stand tall.

39
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,199
Do you understand?

40
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,960
But, Sister...

41
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,520
I'm scared.

42
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:28,840
Don't be afraid.

43
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,000
Your sister is here.

44
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,680
Well...

45
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,280
Sister, I'm willing to go to school.

46
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,080
But you have to teach me to write

47
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,080
"Gesang Deji is not livestock."

48
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,520
Okay, then I'll teach you.

49
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,759
"Gesang Deji is a little greedy cat."

50
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:47,560
"Gesang Deji is a little lazy pig."

51
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,840
Actually, I also really want to know,

52
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,400
what kind of place the Cadre School is.

53
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:02,039
I heard they give out notebooks and teach literacy there.

54
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,439
Everything is different.

55
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:04,840
But I never expected

56
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,639
the first person we'd meet at the Cadre School

57
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,120
would actually be...

58
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,039
Balu Yundan.

59
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,520
Aren't those the two traitorous household serfs from your family?

60
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,080
How are they in the same school as us?

61
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,479
They really delivered themselves right to us.

62
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,919
Sister, why are they here?

63
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,479
I heard the Preparatory Committee

64
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:24,520
needs to do united front work with Xizang's upper class.

65
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,520
They admitted a group of noble children.

66
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,520
I didn't expect Balu Yundan would also...

67
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,439
Let's go.

68
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,439
Let's grab those two brats and bring them back.

69
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,319
Flay them alive!

70
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,719
No rush.

71
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,039
This is Xizang.

72
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,400
They can't escape my grasp.

73
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,039
Stop slacking, bring the things over.

74
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,039
Mhm.

75
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,120
Sister... Mhm.

76
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,520
Have you ever thought,

77
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,240
if in the future we have our own house,

78
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,719
with walls on all sides,

79
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,000
tiles overhead,

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,520
that can shelter us from wind and rain,

81
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,000
and we can lock the door to keep bad people out?

82
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,280
If in the future,

83
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,800
we really have a house of our own,

84
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,120
just like this room...

85
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,240
Balu Yundan!

86
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,720
What are you doing here?

87
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,519
This time, you delivered yourselves to us.

88
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,199
Don't come any closer!

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,800
Run!

90
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:35,720
Balu Yundan!

91
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,079
Deji and I

92
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,199
are public servants registered

93
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:39,720
with the Preparatory Committee.

94
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,399
The PLA sent us here to study.

95
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:42,720
Sister!

96
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:46,279
What are you doing?!

97
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,720
Spent a few days with Han soldiers,

98
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,040
and now you think you're tough?

99
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,360
Hahaha!

100
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,199
The Sixteen-Article Code of Tibet has been law for centuries.

101
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,720
Its rules are ironclad.

102
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,319
Those who defy their superiors must be captured.

103
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,319
Even if you flee to the ends of the earth,

104
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,079
I'll drag you back.

105
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:06,519
To atone for your sins, circling forever.

106
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,480
What are you doing?!

107
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,279
Let her go!

108
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,240
Balu Yundan, if you dare touch her,

109
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,040
I'll fight you to the death!

110
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,240
Yundan...

111
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,800
These two serf sisters of yours...

112
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,920
This is interesting.

113
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,399
This one's as delicate as a little lamb.

114
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,399
Look at this one, as fierce as a little leopard.

115
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,720
Yundan,

116
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,639
Deji is yours.

117
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:29,399
Let us brothers have a taste

118
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,439
of this little leopard, Meiduo.

119
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,519
Let them go!

120
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,519
Bullying students?

121
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,720
Do you want to be expelled?

122
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,480
We are following the rules passed down by our Tibetan ancestors,

123
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,079
disciplining our own household serfs.

124
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,519
Here, there are no nobles,

125
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,319
no household serfs.

126
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,759
Only equal students.

127
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,720
If you dare bully students again,

128
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,160
you are making enemies of the people and the government.

129
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:12,839
Now,

130
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:14,720
leave this place immediately.

131
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,519
Let's go.

132
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,439
Student Meiduo,

133
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,759
you suffered before.

134
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,000
I came to tell you,

135
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
after deliberation by the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region,

136
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,879
Balu Yundan, for drinking, brawling,

137
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,040
and bullying female students,

138
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,000
with egregious circumstances,

139
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,600
has been given a major demerit.

140
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,839
If there is a next time,

141
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,639
he will be expelled directly.

142
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,319
You would really do this for us serfs

143
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,920
and give a noble's son a demerit?

144
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:24,319
Meiduo

145
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,399
Didn't I tell you?

146
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,199
From now on,

147
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,920
there's no distinction between serf and noble.

148
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,959
Everyone is equal.

149
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,079
Oh, right.

150
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,920
The Preparatory Committee

151
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,439
has also issued a major decision.

152
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,000
From now on, local governments in Xizang,

153
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,680
committees, and chieftains

154
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,720
must not impose

155
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
corvée labor on personnel

156
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,199
working for state organs,

157
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,319
or on students and trainees

158
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,519
in Xizang.
All sectors of society

159
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,279
should actively support and assist them.

160
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,680
No one

161
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,600
may persecute them in any form.

162
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,839
Thank you, Brother Gao Yuan.

163
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,199
Thank you, the People's Liberation Army.

164
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,279
I never thought

165
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,639
we would be protected one day.

166
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,040
The sky of Xizang

167
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,439
is truly changing.

168
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,600
Meiduo,

169
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,879
we must keep striving

170
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,319
to ensure all our Tibetan compatriots

171
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,079
can live equal lives.

172
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,519
Mm-hmm.

173
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,840
I have a surprise for you.

174
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,080
Your name.

175
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,320
My name?

176
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,840
It's only been a month,

177
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,759
Meiduo.

178
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,320
You're truly amazing.

179
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,399
Just like you said,

180
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,720
I also want all our Xizang compatriots

181
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,240
to live equal lives.

182
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,879
I'll work even harder.

183
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,000
Meiduo,

184
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,000
let me teach you to write.

185
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,879
Okay.

186
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,320
Here.

187
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,480
When he stood before me like a mountain,

188
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,519
I finally understood.

189
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:33,799
Protection isn't possession.

190
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,279
It's teaching me to stand on my own.

191
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,399
During my time at school,

192
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,799
the pen replaced the shepherd's whip.

193
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,120
The blackboard erased

194
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
the notion of "fate."

195
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:45,120
I must study.

196
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,720
I must study desperately.

197
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,080
I must catch up to Brother Gao Yuan's pace,

198
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,600
and catch up to my own brand-new destiny.

199
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,399
I learned to write my own name.

200
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:58,279
And I will learn much, much more.

201
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,440
For example...

202
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,919
Tomorrow.

203
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:08,679
Watch closely now.

204
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,399
Start with the left foot.

205
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,360
Left, right, left, kick.

206
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,919
Right foot, left foot.

207
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:17,679
Deji, look!

208
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:19,120
(Right foot) Brother Gao Yuan messed up again!

209
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,919
Kick!

210
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,200
Company Commander!

211
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,039
You all should hold hands!

212
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:26,200
Oh, right. Okay, come on.

213
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,840
Sister.

214
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,799
Hmm?

215
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,679
You mention Brother Gao Yuan every day.

216
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,720
Who else is in your eyes besides him?

217
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,919
Is there room for anyone else?

218
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,279
You say his name

219
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,679
ten times more often

220
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,240
than you say mine!

221
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,279
Am I still your favorite person?

222
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,279
Of course you're my favorite.

223
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,279
Right, left, right.

224
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:50,600
Gao Yuan, your dancing is no good!

225
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,600
Meiduo, Deji!

226
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,879
Stop chatting, you two!

227
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,200
Come over and teach us!

228
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,879
Okay!

229
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,039
Let's go.

230
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,480
Sister? Hmm?

231
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,279
Go on.

232
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,159
Isn't Brother Gao Yuan over there

233
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,600
the one who needs a teacher the most?

234
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,399
Go on.

235
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,480
Attention!

236
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,919
Come on, classmates, let's all learn together.

237
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,879
Come on.

238
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,639
Brother Gao Yuan,

239
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,080
Guozhuang isn't hard.

240
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,799
Here.

241
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:31,000
Left, right, kick.

242
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,000
Left, right, left, kick.

243
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,480
Right, left, right, kick.

244
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,919
Left, right, left, kick.

245
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,399
Everyone, stop dancing!

246
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,440
The Central Government has decided on a major contraction of work in Xizang.

247
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,080
We're all being sent home.
