1
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,599
Why did you come without saying a word?

2
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,719
The long journey here...

3
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:14,799
It must have been very hard, right?

4
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:16,079
Let me take a look at you.

5
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,760
I'm not tired.

6
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,640
It's you...

7
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,760
You've gotten darker.

8
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,079
And thinner.

9
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,040
During this time,

10
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,799
your work must have been very hard.

11
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:30,120
Silly Meiduo.

12
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,519
This...

13
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:33,959
is strength.

14
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,760
Recently, the work

15
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,959
has had some setbacks.

16
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,799
But for our fellow Tibetans

17
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,840
to live a life of equality and freedom,

18
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,400
a little hardship

19
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,200
is nothing.

20
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,239
I often think of

21
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,879
what you said when you left.

22
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,840
"I want to build our hometown with you."

23
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,599
I study hard every day.

24
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,480
I want to grow up quickly,

25
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,400
return to Xizang quickly,

26
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,640
and I also want

27
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,200
to see you soon.

28
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,760
I know.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,159
These letters...

30
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,240
I

31
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,199
treasure them like precious gems.

32
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,240
I read them over and over every day.

33
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,439
They are like charcoal fire in the cold winter,

34
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,439
always warming me.

35
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,560
Let me show you to your dormitory.

36
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,080
There's no hurry yet.

37
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,639
I have something more important to tell you.

38
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,000
This is a handwritten letter from Balu Yundan.

39
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,240
I must deliver it to Lord Balu myself.

40
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,960
Balu Dunzhu is a figure

41
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,639
of great influence locally.

42
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,719
Tomorrow,

43
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,639
I can accompany you to visit him

44
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,879
in my capacity as Director of the Reform Office.

45
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,319
We must try to get him

46
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,879
to stand with the people and the Preparatory Committee.

47
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,439
This is also very important work.

48
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:06,960
Mm-hmm.

49
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,400
But right now,

50
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,560
there's an even more important task.

51
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,400
What more important task?

52
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:17,360
You get some proper rest first.

53
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,120
Deji!

54
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,479
Meiduo!

55
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,159
I just had a nightmare.

56
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:50,039
I dreamed my sister and I escaped from Balu Manor,

57
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,439
only to be caught and dragged back.

58
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,240
Don't be afraid.

59
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,360
You are now Captain Gesang of the work team.

60
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,840
No one dares to arrest you.

61
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,560
Besides,

62
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,240
I'm here with you.

63
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,439
Thank you, Brother Gao Yuan.

64
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,800
If I hadn't met you,

65
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,759
everything in my dream just now

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,759
would have been my sister's and my fate.

67
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,480
You mustn't think that way.

68
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,279
Tomorrow, when you deliver the letter,

69
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,079
I'll be right by your side.

70
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,439
Mm-hmm.

71
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,360
We were born...

72
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,399
The Balu name is branded in our bones.

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,040
We can't escape it.

74
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,639
We can't escape it.

75
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,040
Lord! Lord!

76
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:52,480
Lord!

77
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,600
Disaster has come!

78
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,439
The runaway Meiduo has returned!

79
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,800
She's brought the Liberation Army

80
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,879
to take revenge and settle scores with us!

81
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,680
Lord,

82
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,839
let's flee quickly!

83
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,279
Guests...

84
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,839
Since the door curtain has been lifted,

85
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,439
the butter tea must be brought to a boil.

86
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,079
Go.

87
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,839
Invite them in.

88
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,879
I was wondering why today

89
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,199
the magpies on the roof were chattering so.

90
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:24,279
So it's because distinguished guests have arrived!

91
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,040
Director Li graces us with your presence.

92
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,199
Come,

93
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:28,720
please sit.

94
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,439
Wangjiu,

95
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,600
serve tea to our honored guests.

96
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,240
I'll do it myself.

97
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,959
The Liberation Army believes in equality for all.

98
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,079
Greetings, Lord Balu.

99
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,079
We visit unannounced today

100
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:05,160
representing the Shannan Prefectural Party Committee and Naidong County Party Committee.

101
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,399
We are also accompanied by

102
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,040
Captain Gesang Meiduo,

103
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,680
who will soon lead democratic reform work at Balu Manor.

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,199
We have come to meet and talk with you.

105
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:21,560
We wish to discuss with you in detail,

106
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,600
based on the latest policies of the Xizang Preparatory Committee,

107
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,319
regarding

108
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,399
the disposition of the manor's land

109
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,959
and means of production.

110
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,600
We hope you

111
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,839
can fully understand

112
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,480
and cooperate in implementing these policies.

113
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:34,720
Yundan

114
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,800
wrote to me half a year ago about this.

115
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,079
Ah,

116
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,399
I

117
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,240
support the reforms.

118
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,199
Here are the title deeds.

119
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,839
The livestock goes to the commune,

120
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,000
the land is returned to the serfs.

121
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
Meiduo,

122
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,839
all these years,

123
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:55,879
it's not just you who have been learning and progressing.

124
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:58,439
We old folks who stayed in Xizang

125
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,000
have also been learning

126
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,439
and progressing!

127
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,800
Ah ha ha ha ha!

128
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,600
Lord Balu,

129
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,560
your understanding and support for the reforms

130
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,800
is a wise decision.

131
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,759
The Preparatory Committee

132
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,079
keeps its word.

133
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,839
As long as you abide by the policies

134
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:13,879
and cooperate with the work,

135
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,800
the Preparatory Committee

136
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,959
will guarantee all your and your family's legitimate rights.

137
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,160
Yundan

138
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,639
is progressing rapidly at the public school.

139
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,839
Both he and Deji

140
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,839
are good comrades.

141
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:28,560
Lord Balu,

142
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,959
when I returned from the Tibetan Public School,

143
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,279
your son, Balu Yundan,

144
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,799
asked me to bring you a letter.

145
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,279
Father

146
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,559
Only after leaving this plateau

147
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,840
did I realize how vast the world is.

148
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:54,879
Our homeland is too backward.

149
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,240
Our fellow villagers suffer too much.

150
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,360
For the first time, I understood

151
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,399
that all people are born

152
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,799
with bones equally white.

153
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,960
We sweat together,

154
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,240
and share the same joy of harvest.

155
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:15,679
Finally,

156
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,240
I must confess to you.

157
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,639
I have truly fallen in love with Gesang Deji.

158
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:25,120
I absolutely forbid him to be with Gesang Deji!

159
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,279
Back then,

160
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,000
I sent him to study on the mainland

161
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,440
to broaden his horizons,

162
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,399
to gain knowledge.

163
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,799
Who could have imagined

164
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,240
he would stoop so low?

165
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,919
To abandon his own father

166
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,360
for a lowly

167
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,919
hereditary serf woman!
