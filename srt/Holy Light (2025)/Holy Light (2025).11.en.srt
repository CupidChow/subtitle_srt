1
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:54,079
All those noble ladies I found for him

2
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,520
Which one's family background and upbringing

3
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,439
And wealth isn't better than this...

4
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,520
this...

5
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,920
this serf?

6
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,479
They're a hundred times better!

7
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:02,960
Your words are somewhat inappropriate,

8
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,680
Lord Balu.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,200
As a former hereditary household serf of Balu Manor,

10
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,439
and Deji's older sister,

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,359
at first,

12
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:12,000
I also didn't agree to them being together.

13
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:14,239
Since you know

14
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,640
their statuses are different,

15
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,079
just like

16
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,959
yak butter and raw water,

17
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:21,000
even if forced together,

18
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,799
in the end,

19
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:22,959
they will still separate.

20
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,040
If you understand this principle,

21
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,239
then go

22
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,359
and persuade him more.

23
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:27,959
Ah.

24
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes.

25
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,040
I understand.

26
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:35,920
What I understand is

27
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:38,200
the arrogance of noble lords,

28
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,959
carved into their very bones.

29
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:42,599
It's like the walls of this manor,

30
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,159
so high and thick.

31
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,159
I understand

32
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,359
that in your eyes,

33
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,719
we serfs' bloodlines are inherently lowly.

34
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,920
Even the air we breathe

35
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,719
isn't worthy of being as sweet as yours.

36
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,599
My disagreement

37
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,319
is precisely because I know too well

38
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,840
how a lord like you

39
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,319
would view Deji,

40
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,439
and how you would view this love.

41
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,560
Just as you say now:

42
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,800
"Lowly."

43
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,560
"Bewitched."

44
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,560
Using such words

45
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,719
to tarnish two pure hearts.

46
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,199
What I feared was

47
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,439
Deji having to bear

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,080
precisely the kind of

49
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,639
erupting,

50
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,960
deep-rooted contempt like yours.

51
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,039
You,

52
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,919
Zhuoma...

53
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,159
Perhaps what I'm guarding isn't glory,

54
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:35,319
but an old castle long overdue to collapse.

55
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:38,479
What a sharp-tongued captain you are.

56
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,919
So later,

57
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,319
why did you agree?

58
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,159
Because I saw rebellion.

59
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,319
I rebelled against the shackles passed down through serf generations.

60
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,840
And your son,

61
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,280
he is rebelling against

62
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,560
the shackles you imposed on him—

63
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,960
the shackles of a rigid social hierarchy.

64
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,120
He rebels against a fate

65
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,240
that forbids loving someone you truly love.

66
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,639
I imposed on him?

67
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,039
A rigid social hierarchy

68
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,400
is a rule of our Tibetan people

69
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,120
for thousands of years!

70
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,360
Meiduo,

71
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,840
I can overlook your escape.

72
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,360
I can even call you Captain.

73
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:14,960
I can even

74
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,879
support your reforms.

75
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,840
But,

76
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,159
to accept a serf

77
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,360
as my daughter-in-law?

78
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,319
Absolutely not!

79
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,759
You're not just afraid of the girl Deji.

80
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,840
What you fear more is

81
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,319
a new Xizang where serfs' children

82
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,639
and lords' children

83
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,919
sit as equals.

84
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
And your most precious son, Yundan,

85
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,439
has already embraced this new world.

86
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,840
He chose Deji

87
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,639
not because he was bewitched,

88
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,840
but because he saw the rot of the old system.

89
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,439
He saw the life and partner he truly wants.

90
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,240
He is rebelling against

91
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,479
the noble shackles you forced upon him.

92
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,759
And I rebelled against

93
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,960
the chains of serfdom.

94
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,759
In this sense,

95
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,360
he and I

96
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,759
are on the same front line.

97
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,560
Lord!

98
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,759
Wake up!

99
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,920
These words

100
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,959
are all poison!

101
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,600
They're the bewitching potion

102
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,160
the Han people fed to the Young Master!

103
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,040
Gesang Meiduo has returned for revenge!

104
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,839
You must not believe her!

105
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,839
She is a hereditary household serf,

106
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,639
a...

107
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,560
It's not them who are wrong.

108
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,839
The one who is wrong...

109
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,360
is me.

110
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,279
Wangjiu.

111
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,720
From today onward,

112
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,639
you are no longer

113
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,279
the steward of our household.

114
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,560
You are free.

115
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,759
Lord...

116
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,720
Go.

117
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:14,439
Yes.

118
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,959
Tea should be drunk while hot.

119
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,120
Once it cools,

120
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,120
the flavor changes.

121
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:01,759
Zhuoma,

122
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,759
my White Tara...

123
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,680
You watch from the heavens.

124
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,519
Your eyes

125
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,120
are always so bright,

126
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,920
able to see through people's hearts.

127
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,120
This world...

128
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,480
has truly changed.

129
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,399
This old bones of mine

130
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,120
can't quite keep up.

131
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:30,480
Nowadays,

132
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,240
I can't even intimidate him anymore.

133
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,360
But what I can do

134
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,839
is

135
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,560
to not be the rope

136
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,160
that ties his wings.

137
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,000
May Yundan's heart,

138
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,360
like a stream from melting snow mountains,

139
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,319
flow steadfastly towards Deji.

140
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,160
He even

141
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,680
rebelled for her sake.

142
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,360
Alright.

143
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,160
Let us bless them.

144
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,639
Bless them.

145
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:14,240
Bless them

146
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,519
with peace and happiness.

147
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,120
I have passed through

148
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,519
the gates of hell countless times.

149
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,160
It has trapped countless serfs.

150
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,279
But I believe

151
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,639
that one day,

152
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,879
the shacks on this land will become warm houses,

153
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,399
and the lord's manor

154
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,519
will become our shared home.

155
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,959
If sunlight can reach the cattle sheds,

156
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,759
if every person bound by chains

157
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,839
can truly be reborn,

158
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,600
then this is the ideal

159
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,720
I would fight with my life

160
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,120
to achieve.
