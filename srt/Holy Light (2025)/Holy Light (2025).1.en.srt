1
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:57,840
That manor

2
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,679
was once my entire world.

3
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,119
The whip,

4
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,159
the chains,

5
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:03,520
and days and nights spent kneeling.

6
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,239
Now, standing here,

7
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,319
the wind is free, and so am I.

8
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:08,840
So am I.

9
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,159
Ha ha ha ha ha!

10
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,079
Lord Balu,

11
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:15,680
it seems

12
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,959
the heavens are not on your side today.

13
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:19,040
Your luck

14
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,560
is more withered than frost-bitten barley.

15
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,319
Ha ha ha ha ha!

16
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,159
You've only won a few rounds,

17
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:31,480
and your tail

18
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,159
is already raised to the heavens.

19
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:33,719
Again!

20
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,439
Wow!

21
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,000
Deji!

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,920
Don't!

23
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,159
Sister!

24
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:50,959
Here, eat this.

25
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,280
Master!

26
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,719
I failed to discipline my sister.

27
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,920
Please forgive her.

28
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,040
Useless wretch!

29
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,280
Is this how my Balu estate teaches you to behave?

30
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,960
Hmm.

31
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,479
Ah!

32
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,520
Master!

33
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,280
It's my fault.

34
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,360
Don't hit my sister!

35
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,360
Master, I was wrong!

36
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,840
Sister!

37
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,759
What a pretty face.

38
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,400
Next round,

39
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,039
I'll wager her body.

40
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,080
Achoo!

41
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,840
What's your wager?

42
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,439
I'll wager

43
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,560
one yak.

44
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,919
She is my household serf.

45
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,199
Ten yaks

46
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:50,840
wouldn't be enough.

47
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,120
A mere household serf

48
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,400
has you

49
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,639
drooling like that?

50
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,039
Our Balu estate has plenty of serfs.

51
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,199
Ten yaks

52
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,080
is a good deal for us.

53
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,960
Father!

54
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,120
She's soft.

55
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,439
Ten it is, then.

56
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,280
I'll take that bet.

57
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,560
She's yours.

58
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,639
Come here.

59
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:08,280
Today, I'll taste you, this unplucked

60
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,080
little serf girl.

61
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,319
What are you doing?

62
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,120
What are you doing?

63
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,120
Don't come any closer!

64
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,319
I'm just craving your body, of course.

65
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:50,040
I'll have you right now!

66
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,800
You dare to kick?

67
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:58,759
Young Master Balu!

68
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,759
Your father lost her to me.

69
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,879
What are you doing?

70
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:03,879
She belongs to me.

71
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,560
It has nothing to do with my father.

72
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
Leave if you don't want to die.

73
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,240
Fine.

74
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,720
I'll remember you.

75
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,959
What are you afraid of?

76
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,199
Shouldn't you thank me?

77
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,920
Gesang Deji,

78
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,959
in life, you are mine.

79
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,720
In death, you'll be my ghost.

80
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,920
Sister!

81
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,120
Deji!

82
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,399
Sister!

83
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,040
From the moment we were born,

84
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,079
the name Balu was carved into our very bones.

85
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,720
We can't escape.

86
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,319
We can't escape!

87
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,240
Calm down!

88
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,839
Staying here means death.

89
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,720
Only by escaping is there hope.

90
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,079
From now on,

91
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,000
our lives are our own.

92
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,040
Let's go!

93
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,079
Sister...

94
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,759
I really can't run anymore.

95
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,120
Don't give up!

96
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,319
Go!

97
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,519
Deji!

98
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,639
Deji!

99
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,959
Don't be afraid.

100
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:29,839
I'm from the People's Liberation Army.

101
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,560
Deji!

102
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,519
Deji!

103
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,279
Deji!

104
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,360
What are you doing to her?

105
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,959
Are you sealing her spirit bone with needles?

106
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,040
Taking her soul?

107
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,639
To make her into an A Jie Gu drum?

108
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,000
Meiduo!

109
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,759
You've misunderstood.

110
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,160
This is Comrade Li Yuling.

111
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,360
She is a doctor in our Liberation Army.

112
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,160
She can heal.

113
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,519
Your sister has a very high fever.

114
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,680
Doctor Li is using our traditional medicine,

115
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,839
acupuncture, to treat her.

116
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,920
You were unconscious before,

117
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,959
and she revived you as well.

118
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,639
If you dare hurt her,

119
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,360
I'll fight you to the death!

120
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,840
Sister...

121
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,279
Sister...

122
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,879
Deji!

123
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,720
Deji, you're awake!

124
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,320
The Bodhisattva protects us.

125
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,519
The Bodhisattva protects us.

126
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,519
The Bodhisattva protects us.

127
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,159
It wasn't the Bodhisattva.

128
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,240
It was Yi Gaoyuan.

129
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,320
Company Commander Yi sent me.

130
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:49,960
Healing the sick and saving lives,

131
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,399
liberating poor farmers and herders,

132
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,480
is our duty.

133
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,679
Sister...

134
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,519
Where are we?

135
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,639
Don't worry.

136
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,639
We haven't been captured.

137
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,720
I just

138
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,879
dreamt of many highland barley cakes.

139
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:09,840
So fragrant.

140
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,679
Just now,

141
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:55,240
I dreamt of many highland barley cakes.
