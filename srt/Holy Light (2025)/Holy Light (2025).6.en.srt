1
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,600
Oh, child

2
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,280
Why didn't you tell me you were bringing a girl?

3
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,520
Hello, Uncle.

4
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,840
My name is Gesang Meiduo.

5
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,280
Ah.

6
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,280
Hello, young lady.

7
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:03,399
Come, sit inside.

8
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:04,680
Go on, go play.

9
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,319
Here, you go in first.

10
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:09,879
I'll go get the bag.

11
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:10,680
Oh, okay.

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,040
Uncle.

13
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,959
This is for you.

14
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,439
Oh, you shouldn't have spent the money.

15
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,120
Oh my.

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,799
Hey, Sis.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,879
Bro.

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,239
Sis.

19
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:26,280
Let me introduce you.

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,439
This is my classmate from Xizang.

21
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:29,359
Gesang Meiduo.

22
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,120
Hello, Sister.

23
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,920
She's always heard

24
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,760
that our family lives on the fertile Wuling Yuan.

25
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,400
So she wanted to come see it.

26
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,719
Hey.

27
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:40,560
Where's Mom?

28
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,920
Come here, I need to tell you something.

29
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,200
You're all here.

30
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,560
Is this your partner?

31
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,560
I like her.

32
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,200
But I

33
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,519
haven't expressed my feelings.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,519
I don't know how she

35
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,400
feels about it.

36
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,599
Darn it.

37
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,000
Mom went to Shuangzhao Village

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,319
to fetch the matchmaker and your blind date.

39
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,760
That girl is coming to our house today.

40
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
What?

41
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:13,159
So you're Uncle Gao Yuan's blind date?

42
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,680
What's a 'partner'?

43
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,840
They all say that this year, in Uncle Gao Yuan's matchmaking,

44
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,479
they want him to come home early,

45
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,560
get married early,

46
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,719
and have a child early.

47
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,400
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

48
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,960
Mom didn't tell me when she left either.

49
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:28,520
Here.

50
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,199
Wen Li.

51
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,520
This is our home.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,800
Mom.

53
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:32,639
Mom.

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,919
Son.

55
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:34,719
Look.

56
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,000
This is Teacher Wen Li from Shuangzhao Village.

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,360
A high school graduate.

58
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,280
So lovely.

59
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:40,439
Oh.

60
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,000
Wen Li.

61
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,680
This is my son, Gao Yuan.

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,879
Hello.

63
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:50,719
Young lady.

64
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,599
You are?

65
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,599
Meiduo.

66
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,120
Mom.

67
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,120
I'll explain to you later.

68
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,479
Huh?

69
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,520
Meiduo.

70
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,360
Meiduo.

71
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,479
Meiduo.

72
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,439
Brother Gao Yuan.

73
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,120
I didn't know today was your blind date.

74
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,159
If I stay there,

75
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,800
Miss Wen Li will misunderstand.

76
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,159
She misunderstands?

77
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,280
And you don't misunderstand?

78
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,800
Today you're reuniting with your family.

79
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,120
They're so eager for you to get married,

80
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,080
to have children.

81
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,680
Well, I have to be willing too.

82
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,000
From Xizang to Xianyang,

83
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,199
you've helped me so much.

84
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,719
I will always be grateful to you.

85
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,759
You're grateful to me,

86
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,080
so you just run off by yourself?

87
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,599
And tell me to marry that girl?

88
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,479
Meiduo.

89
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,159
You've considered a lot.

90
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,800
You've considered me,

91
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,680
considered my family,

92
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,680
even considered that girl.

93
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,599
But you haven't said the most important thing.

94
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,879
The most important

95
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,920
thing is,

96
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,360
what do *you* think?

97
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,279
Meiduo.

98
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,600
I like you.

99
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,800
You are now an independent,

100
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,399
free-thinking individual.

101
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:35,879
You have the right to think

102
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:36,680
and to choose.

103
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,720
And I will respect your choice.

104
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,240
Now,

105
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,759
setting aside everything else,

106
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,920
what do you think?

107
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,720
What I think

108
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,879
is the same as you.

109
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,560
Brother Gao Yuan.

110
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:35,759
What brings you here?

111
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,160
Last time at my place,

112
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,800
I didn't get to let you try authentic Guanzhong noodles.

113
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,319
Haven't made them in a long time.

114
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,120
A bit out of practice.

115
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,120
Have a taste.

116
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,959
Okay.

117
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
Mmm.

118
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,399
Smells wonderful.

119
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,519
I didn't expect

120
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,319
you to have such skill.

121
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,879
Well, as the old saying goes,

122
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,360
if a Guanzhong person can eat,

123
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,160
they can make noodles.

124
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,519
Mhm.

125
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,000
That's not how you eat it.

126
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,720
Let me show you.

127
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,000
This on top is the saozi.

128
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,000
You have to mix it in.

129
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,120
Here.

130
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,199
Alright.

131
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,720
Is it good?

132
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:19,600
It's delicious.

133
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,120
Brother Gao Yuan.

134
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:32,759
Do you have something you want to say to me?

135
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,639
I have something

136
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,319
I want to give you.

137
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,759
What is this?

138
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,199
It's a letter.

139
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,360
I have a lot I want to say to you.

140
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,279
It's all written in the letter.

141
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,920
This is the first letter I've ever received.

142
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,680
Can you read it to me?

143
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,199
Okay.

144
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,079
Meiduo.

145
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,199
Seeing these words is like seeing me.

146
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,319
Mhm.

147
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,519
It means that

148
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,600
when you see these words,

149
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,199
it's just like seeing me.

150
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,240
That day

151
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,639
What I said to you on the plateau

152
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,279
was all sincere.

153
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,720
In my heart,

154
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,279
there has never been anyone else.

155
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,639
And after meeting you,

156
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,040
there's no room for anyone else.

157
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,759
There's only you.

158
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,120
I want

159
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,600
my shoulder to shield you from the wind.

160
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,759
I want

161
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,199
to always keep you safe.

162
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,959
I want

163
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,680
to make noodles for you every day.

164
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,680
But,

165
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,759
I've received orders.

166
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,639
Tomorrow morning,

167
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,360
I must transport important supplies

168
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,399
back to Xizang.

169
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,079
The mission is critical,

170
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:09,879
and the road is perilous.

171
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,839
This trip,

172
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,800
will take at least five or six months.

173
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,199
Longer,

174
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,360
is hard to predict.

175
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,120
Meiduo,

176
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,079
this is very sudden.

177
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,560
But a soldier's foremost duty is to obey orders.

178
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,279
I hope

179
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,199
you won't be angry,

180
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,399
and won't be sad.

181
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:34,360
Brother Gao Yuan,

182
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,840
You are returning to my homeland,

183
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,279
to liberate the suffering people.

184
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,799
How could I be angry?

185
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,799
The person I've chosen,

186
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,200
will never change.

187
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
If you are an eagle,

188
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,559
you must fly back to the snowy mountains.

189
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:51,240
However,

190
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,480
you must promise me

191
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,200
to return safely.

192
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:55,919
From now on,

193
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,480
we'll speak through letters.

194
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,320
I will definitely wait for your return.

195
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,799
It's a promise.

196
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,080
Although each letter

197
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,759
must travel a very long road,

198
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,960
cross many, many mountains,

199
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,320
and take

200
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,759
a very, very long time,

201
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,799
every time I see your letter,

202
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,200
it's as if you are by my side.

203
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,799
My letters

204
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,879
will also take my place

205
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:22,759
to accompany you.

206
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:31,600
Have you seen student Meiduo?

207
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,480
Brother Gao Yuan,

208
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,360
Brother Gao Yuan!

209
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,200
Wen Li?

210
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,360
What brings you here?

211
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:41,200
Last time at your home was so brief,

212
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,279
we barely had a chance to talk.

213
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,480
Today you're returning to Xizang again,

214
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,480
so

215
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,000
I came specifically to see you off.

216
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,480
Do you remember?

217
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,919
When we were kids, you ate and stayed at my house.

218
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,679
You and my brother played from dawn till dusk.

219
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,080
You traded the pen for the sword and went to Xizang.

220
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,200
My parents, my brother,

221
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,519
and I,

222
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,080
we are all very proud of you.

223
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,480
Mm.

224
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,080
Wen Li,

225
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,440
um,

226
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,000
please give my regards to your parents.

227
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,720
You don't need to avoid me.

228
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,879
I know Xizang is harsh,

229
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,840
but I

230
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,279
could perhaps go to Xizang to find you.

231
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:18,279
Supporting the construction needs talent from all fields,

232
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,120
doesn't it?

233
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,279
The plateau is windy and cold.

234
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,759
Take this to keep warm.

235
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,799
Wen Li,

236
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,279
I appreciate your kindness.

237
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,399
Actually, that day I wanted to tell you...

238
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,159
Meiduo!

239
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:36,559
Brother Gao Yuan!

240
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,440
I thought

241
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,720
you wouldn't come to see me off today.

242
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,879
This harmonica,

243
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,679
I searched the whole city to buy it.

244
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,879
I hope that after you reach the plateau,

245
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,799
when you play it,

246
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:51,879
you'll think of me.
