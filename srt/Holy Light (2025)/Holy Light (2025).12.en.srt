1
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,399
Meiduo

2
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,240
You have something on your mind.

3
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,079
No, I don't.

4
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,920
I'm so happy to be reunited with you.

5
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,879
And I'm even happier that through our efforts,

6
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,040
the serfs can live a good life.

7
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:17,640
Even though we're often apart,

8
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,400
in my heart,

9
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,799
we've long been spiritual partners

10
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,120
who share everything without reservation.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,319
So when you have something on your mind,

12
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,480
I can see it at a glance.

13
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:36,599
I...

14
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,519
Let's break up.

15
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:42,400
Why?

16
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,319
Did I do something wrong?

17
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,120
No.

18
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,599
In the over three years I've known you,

19
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:49,920
I've come from the bottom of my heart

20
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,879
to see you as my lifelong inspiration.

21
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,840
But Xizang needs me,

22
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,200
and your family far away in Xianyang

23
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,319
needs you to go back.

24
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:03,239
It's not the right time for me to go with you.

25
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,079
I can't selfishly hold you back.

26
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,599
I can't let you stay in Xizang

27
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,520
carrying guilt towards your family.

28
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,439
It's not fair to you or your family.

29
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,639
Why would you think

30
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,479
I'm being transferred back home?

31
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,000
Because I saw the photo of your family.

32
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,439
Your family must miss you dearly,

33
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,319
and you miss them too.

34
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,800
I know they've been hoping for your return,

35
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,240
hoping you'd marry and have children.

36
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:38,680
So you're acting on behalf of my parents,

37
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,280
pressuring me to get married, is that it?

38
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,639
I followed the troops into Xizang.

39
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,520
For seven or eight years,

40
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,639
we were stationed in many places.

41
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,919
Yet I met you many times.

42
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,080
Through these meetings, we came to know and love each other.

43
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,879
Will you marry me?

44
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,400
I do.

45
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,560
I do.

46
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,919
Grandma, tell me something else.

47
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,639
Alright.

48
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,080
Let me tell you about 60 years ago.

49
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,120
Our school held its first opening ceremony.

50
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:50,120
Back then,

51
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,360
there was no proper square,

52
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,960
no stage,

53
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,759
no lighting,

54
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,560
or surround sound.

55
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,039
There was just a wooden platform.

56
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,439
But I feel

57
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,759
that was the happiest time of my life.

58
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,000
Hahaha.

59
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,879
Every day spent with you

60
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,479
is the happiest time of my life.

61
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,479
Grandpa.

62
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,360
I've literally been fed your "dog food" since I was a kid.

63
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,120
Back then, you sent Grandma to study at this school.

64
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,120
Later, you had Uncle and Aunt enroll here too.

65
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,120
Uncle met Auntie here.

66
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,839
And now I've come to this school too.

67
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,439
Not just three generations of our family,

68
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:31,199
but also your other grandpas and grandmas,

69
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,279
uncles and aunts,

70
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,240
all started from here.

71
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,639
They entered the workforce,

72
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:41,560
found their life's direction and happiness.

73
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,000
Did they all go to Xizang too?

74
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:46,000
Not only did they go to Xizang,

75
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,000
they started families and careers there.

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,720
They built united families.

77
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,040
Their children all have a Han Chinese name

78
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,160
and a Xizang name.

79
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,199
Oh.

80
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,800
Like Auntie, whose name is Yiximei

81
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,720
and her Xizang language name is Tsewang Lhamo.

82
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,040
You're right.

83
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,800
Just like your uncle and your mother,

84
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,800
these people

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,600
all share a common,

86
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,439
very meaningful ethnic designation.

87
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,519
They're called the Unity Clan.

88
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,560
Is it good? Mhm.

89
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,959
Meiduo. Mhm.

90
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,920
You look so beautiful today.

91
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,199
You look very handsome today too.

92
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,639
Mhm.

93
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,519
At the wedding,

94
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,360
the clusters of burning bonfires

95
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,959
illuminated not just my and Gao Yuan's faces,

96
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,800
but also a future we once dared not imagine.

97
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,639
Deji and Yundan also held hands.

98
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,000
So it turns out

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,920
fate really can be earned by oneself.

100
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,360
In this moment, there were no Lords,

101
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
no Household Serfs.

102
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,040
There was only song and dance,

103
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,920
and only free people.
