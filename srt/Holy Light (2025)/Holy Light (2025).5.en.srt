1
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,759
Sister Yuling

2
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,480
You are so kind.

3
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,319
Teaching us to read and write,

4
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:08,879
to do math and sing,

5
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:10,799
and even washing our clothes

6
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,680
and cutting our hair.

7
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,920
I heard

8
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,920
that those teachers

9
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,640
are all college students

10
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,159
from big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.

11
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,560
They gave up such good places

12
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,359
to come here and help us.

13
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,280
Don't say that.

14
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,480
Seeing you study in peace

15
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,480
and grow up healthy

16
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,280
makes us happier than anything.

17
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,359
By the way,

18
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:31,239
do you know the story behind Brother Gao Yuan's harmonica?

19
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,760
Last time,

20
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,959
after he was injured building the road,

21
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,680
he couldn't find it anywhere.

22
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:38,920
I saw him go look under the collapsed cliff several times.

23
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,519
Is this harmonica

24
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,560
very important to him?

25
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,159
It's his keepsake.

26
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,640
When he first graduated from college

27
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,000
and joined the army,

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,319
he was still a rookie.

29
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,040
On the way into Tibet,

30
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:53,239
his old squad leader died

31
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,560
protecting him.

32
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,560
That harmonica

33
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,120
is the only thing his old squad leader left him.

34
00:01:59,079 --> 00:01:59,599
Later on,

35
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,239
as his comrades fell one by one,

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,319
Gao Yuan played the harmonica

37
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,159
more and more often.

38
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:07,680
Meiduo.

39
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,199
Hmm?

40
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,599
Don't be fooled by his mouth,

41
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,719
which seems locked shut.

42
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,599
But the fire in his heart

43
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,120
burns fiercer than anyone's.

44
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,719
His feelings are truer than anyone's.

45
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,759
For the brothers who never returned,

46
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,479
and for our Tibetan compatriots

47
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,759
to live a good life,

48
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,280
for six years now,

49
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,800
his home is right there,

50
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,520
yet he hasn't gone back once.

51
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,439
The home in his heart

52
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,520
is no longer that little courtyard on Xianyang Yuan.

53
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,800
Classmates,

54
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,639
today we won't teach reading

55
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,280
or arithmetic.

56
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,000
Today, we'll discuss a word:

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,120
"ideal."

58
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,280
Teacher,

59
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,520
what is an ideal?

60
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,840
An ideal is

61
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,919
a beautiful, long-term goal or state

62
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,719
that people yearn for in their hearts

63
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,879
and strive to achieve.

64
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,919
In simple terms,

65
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,879
an ideal is something

66
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,719
a person would give their life to do.

67
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,039
Gesang Deji,

68
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,479
take Deji for example.

69
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:20,039
Why did you hide the acupuncture kit yesterday?

70
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,479
Were you thinking that

71
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,680
someday,

72
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,080
you too would heal and save people?

73
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,280
Mm-hmm.

74
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,039
Yes.

75
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,360
That is your ideal.

76
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:28,960
Meiduo,

77
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,520
tell us,

78
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,719
what is your ideal?

79
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,800
Something I'd give my life to do...

80
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,080
was to escape with my sister.

81
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,879
But does that count as an ideal?

82
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,639
My...

83
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,199
My ideal

84
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:45,879
is...

85
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,360
It's okay.

86
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,439
Classmates,

87
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,240
An ideal isn't something you have in a day or two,

88
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,039
nor is it unchanging.

89
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:59,680
I hope you all can have your own ideals

90
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,240
and strive for them.

91
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,719
Truly lowborn to the core.

92
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,479
You'd pick up something so filthy.

93
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,400
Exactly.

94
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,560
Like an animal,

95
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,839
not even minding the dirt.

96
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,800
No wonder you're born from household serfs.

97
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,040
How dare you talk about my sister like that!

98
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,959
What are you all doing?

99
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,879
Apologize to classmate Meiduo.

100
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,879
Why should we?

101
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,759
Meiduo,

102
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,600
it fell on the dirty ground.

103
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,759
Eat my portion.

104
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,079
Give me yours to eat.

105
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,720
Dirty?

106
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,519
I don't think so.

107
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:57,560
I won't feel ashamed for eating a dirty pancake.

108
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm ashamed of your condescension.

109
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,240
You feed on the blood and flesh of serfs,

110
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:07,199
yet you even mock them for eating a dirty pancake.

111
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,839
What's ingrained in your bones

112
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,959
is a cruelty and indifference toward your own kind you can't wash away.

113
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,680
You are the ones who are truly dirty,

114
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,879
the lowborn ones you speak of.

115
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,160
Meiduo.

116
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,759
Meiduo.

117
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,439
Are you okay?

118
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:42,000
Brother Gao Yuan.

119
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,000
In your mind,

120
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,639
am I that fragile?

121
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,040
Then why

122
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,120
did you come out here?

123
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,959
I just suddenly understood

124
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,879
what it means to do something with all your might,

125
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,720
what an ideal is.

126
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,120
Fellow classmates,

127
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
welcome.

128
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,480
Today is our Life Ideals Discussion Meeting.

129
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,279
Classmate Meiduo,

130
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,519
you go first.

131
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,279
I...

132
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,959
Let's give classmate Meiduo a round of applause.

133
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,279
Since I was little, I lived

134
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,639
a life no different from cattle and sheep.

135
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,759
Before I was 20,

136
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,920
I never had a full meal.

137
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,639
As soon as I could hold a whip,

138
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,279
I went to herd sheep for the lord.

139
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,439
When I got a bit older,

140
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,079
I was sent to Balu Mansion to be a household serf.

141
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,759
Inside the high walls of Balu Mansion,

142
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,959
the master lived in the tower in the center of the courtyard.

143
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,240
A dozen of us household serfs huddled in the hay of the cowshed.

144
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,160
Carrying water,

145
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,399
scrubbing floors,

146
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,480
feeding horses,

147
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,439
getting beaten and scolded.

148
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,560
When Mom got sick,

149
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,920
there was no money for treatment.

150
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:17,160
When Mom died,

151
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,800
there was no money for a burial.

152
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,199
Trampled upon,

153
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,759
bought and sold at will,

154
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,800
given away as gifts.

155
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:29,399
The only difference from cattle and sheep

156
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,560
was that we could speak.

157
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,920
If I hadn't escaped with my sister,

158
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,720
if the PLA hadn't saved us,

159
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,199
and given us the chance to study

160
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,600
and work,

161
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,040
I wouldn't know

162
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,000
what dignity,

163
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,600
freedom,

164
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,879
and equality are.

165
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,639
I certainly wouldn't understand what ideals are.

166
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,959
But now I have an ideal.

167
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,680
That is to study hard,

168
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,439
return to Xizang,

169
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,240
and liberate more serfs like us.

170
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:14,079
They are still in the straw nests by the animal pens,

171
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,480
suffering,

172
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,680
and being humiliated.

173
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,680
I agree with what Meiduo said.

174
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,360
We must return to Xizang as soon as possible

175
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,439
to help more

176
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,279
serfs like us,

177
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:31,920
and let them live a good life.

178
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,480
At our opening ceremony today,

179
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:45,080
we have not only students from the Tibetan Public School

180
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,159
but also students from the Tibetan Youth League School.

181
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,279
From now on,

182
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:50,360
we will all learn from each other.

183
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,039
Especially the young ladies and masters from noble families,

184
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,840
you must learn more from student Gesang,

185
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,000
communicate more,

186
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,720
and get rid of your pampered habits.

187
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,360
Become self-reliant workers.

188
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,919
Meiduo,

189
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,519
what you said yesterday was great.

190
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,320
I sent you to Shaanxi to study

191
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,399
because right now in Xizang,

192
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,159
it cannot yet hold a quiet desk.

193
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,639
You must study hard,

194
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:24,639
enrich yourself,

195
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,639
and strive to soon

196
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,759
return to Xizang

197
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:28,879
to participate in management and construction.

198
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,240
Yeah.

199
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,000
Meiduo,

200
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,320
there's something

201
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,840
I want to ask your opinion on.

202
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,919
What is it? Go ahead.

203
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,440
I want to ask...

204
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:44,960
I want...

205
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:48,039
Meiduo,

206
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,960
I actually want to ask you...

207
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,320
Um,

208
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,919
I want to go home tomorrow.

209
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,200
Do you want to come with me?

210
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,360
I...

211
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,720
The wind blows,

212
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,919
the wheels roll by,

213
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:12,320
but I only hear my own heartbeat.

214
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:15,320
His back as he rides is steadier than a snow mountain,

215
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,639
while I hold wildflowers, sweating with nervousness.

216
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,960
If only this road had no end.

217
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,639
Just following him like this,

218
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:24,720
through the waves of wheat,

219
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:25,960
through the cooking smoke,

220
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,480
all the way to what I never dared to dream of before:

221
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,840
the direction of home.

222
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,240
We're here.

223
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:40,840
Let's go.

224
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,080
Is there anything I should mind when meeting your family?

225
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,080
No need to mind anything.

226
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,960
They are all very easygoing.

227
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,159
Gao Yuan.

228
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,919
Dad!
