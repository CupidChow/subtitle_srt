1
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,511
Did you kill Song Min-a?

2
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,226
Answer me.

3
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,396
Do you think Ha-jun

4
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,483
really died by accident?

5
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:09,944
What?

6
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,290
What about Mom?

7
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:30,006
Do you really think Mom killed herself?

8
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,585
This is the police. Is anyone home?

9
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,518
It looks like nobody's home.
Let's come back tomorrow.

10
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:31,484
UNREACHABLE

11
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,578
Yong-su.

12
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,996
Yes?

13
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,622
What was the suspect's name again?

14
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,792
It's Jang Ha-bin.

15
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,294
Hey.

16
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,671
This is Captain Jang's car, right?

17
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,758
Why is his car here?

18
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,059
CAPTAIN OH JEONG-HWAN

19
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,357
Stay in your room.

20
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,620
Hey, what did you…

21
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,310
Let's talk outside.

22
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,646
I can explain everything.

23
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,232
I believe she can provide
a more accurate explanation.

24
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,276
Can we talk for a minute?

25
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:04,077
Man, that looks painful.

26
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,954
What happened to your arm?

27
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,122
She got hurt in this neighborhood.

28
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,042
You can check her medical records.

29
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,126
Captain Jang.

30
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,380
Why don't we save our talk for later?

31
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,090
We have a lot to talk about anyway.

32
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,723
Where were you
and what did you do on the 11th?

33
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:31,229
May I ask
why you're asking me those questions?

34
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,274
We have a case
that happened in Mount Daehwa.

35
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,568
And we found the location information
showing you were there that day.

36
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,113
Mount Daehwa?

37
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,281
Yes.

38
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,491
I haven't been there.

39
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:47,829
You haven't?

40
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,374
I see.

41
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:56,963
Is this perhaps

42
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,717
related to Song Min-a too?

43
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,472
Do you know Song Min-a?

44
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,559
About a week ago,

45
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,437
we went to a precinct after a fight.

46
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:13,980
Why did you two fight?

47
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,358
I saw her
stealing someone's phone on the subway

48
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,568
and I followed her.

49
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:22,447
And we had a little scuffle
when I tried to report her to the police.

50
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,865
So you didn't know each other?

51
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,201
No. That's when I met her
for the first time.

52
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,206
I lost my phone that day.

53
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,375
Your daughter stole Song Min-a's phone.

54
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,670
I had a feeling
she was the one who stole it.

55
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:43,634
I didn't tell Dad about this either.
I didn't want to get involved.

56
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,393
Could you tell us
what you did on the 11th?

57
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:56,314
Well, I…

58
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,446
I was with my boyfriend.

59
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,658
You were with your boyfriend?

60
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,413
Could you tell us
his name and contact information?

61
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,625
Yes.

62
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,502
Good.

63
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,923
Hey, what do you think?

64
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,720
I don't know.
She didn't seem very suspicious.

65
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,891
She told us things
that could work against her.

66
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,227
And Song Min-a did commit theft before.

67
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,147
Everything falls into place too perfectly.

68
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,608
She seemed unshaken too.

69
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,070
Captain Jang seemed more shaken to me.

70
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,865
I've never seen him like that.

71
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,703
You stole the phone.

72
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,376
The light blue phone in your bag.

73
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,256
That's Song Min-a's phone.

74
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,261
Why would I steal her phone?

75
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:15,476
I heard you asked her to meet you
saying you'd give it back.

76
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,645
Who said that?

77
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,273
Don't answer my question
with another question.

78
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:26,779
Did you meet Song Min-a on the 11th?

79
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:31,284
I didn't meet her,
and I didn't steal her phone.

80
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,494
Then whose phone was that?

81
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,705
Why bother asking if you won't believe me?

82
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,042
You believe others
saying I stole the phone,

83
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,171
but you think I'm lying?

84
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,097
Tell me.

85
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,853
What you said earlier
about Ha-jun and your mom…

86
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,731
What did you mean by that?

87
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,360
Every time someone I know dies,
you suspect me.

88
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,118
Dad.

89
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,039
What kind of person am I to you?

90
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,595
PROFILER JANG TAE-SU

91
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:11,402
KIM GYU-SEON EXPRESSES GRATITUDE
TO PROFILER JANG TAE-SU

92
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:15,323
FOR EXONERATING HIM
FROM MURDER CHARGES

93
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,774
-Hello.
-Good morning.

94
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,652
Hi.

95
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,615
All right, thanks. Bye.

96
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,699
Sir.

97
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,993
Detective Cho just confirmed

98
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,205
that she got injured in her neighborhood
the day after the incident.

99
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,375
Really?

100
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,379
Is something bothering you?

101
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,964
JANG HA-BIN
DOWOON HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM

102
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,216
Does it matter?

103
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,053
We'll just keep digging
until all the alibis are confirmed.

104
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:22,223
Excuse me.
Are you the detective who called me?

105
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,767
Right. Mr. Lee Su-hyeon?

106
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,647
You were with her all night?

107
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,234
In the same room?

108
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,487
Whatever you're worried about,
it didn't happen.

109
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,408
I'm sorry.

110
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,035
Look up.

111
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,789
Look at me when you answer me.

112
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:54,088
Did you two stay in the same room
the entire day on the 11th?

113
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,842
Yes, we didn't leave the room.

114
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,552
We got all the food delivered.

115
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,973
Song Min-a.

116
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:14,984
You know her, right?

117
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,446
No.

118
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,698
Are you sure?

119
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,159
Yes.

120
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,869
I told the other detectives too.

121
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:34,503
Have you noticed something off
about Ha-bin lately?

122
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,673
Could you stop being like this to her?

123
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,551
What?

124
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,344
Ha-bin is a good person.

125
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,806
You don't seem to know.

126
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,738
SIR, I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING

127
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,114
About Jang Ha-bin…

128
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,744
Yes?

129
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,370
We should meet her.

130
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,624
She had a fight with Song Min-a
a few days before she died.

131
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,295
According to her statements,
she's not a runaway either.

132
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,883
It's been confirmed.

133
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,093
Already? What's been confirmed?

134
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,058
Excuse me. I need to take this call.

135
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:30,893
Yes, Captain.

136
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,229
Do you have a minute?

137
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,649
Let's go!

138
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,985
-You got this!
-Let's go!

139
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,862
You can do it!

140
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,240
Let's go!

141
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,955
-Nice!
-Well done.

142
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,790
Nice, Ha-bin.

143
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,250
Ha-bin is a good person.

144
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,753
You don't seem to know.

145
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,380
Come on! This way!

146
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,271
You're Ha-bin's dad, right?

147
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,107
Yes.

148
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,443
We met at the funeral.

149
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,114
-Hello, Mr. Park.
-Hi.

150
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,240
Hey, stop it.

151
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,159
I know Su-hyeon very well.

152
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,620
They were close in the tenth grade.

153
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,582
What is Su-hyeon like?

154
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:41,005
Su-hyeon is quiet and acts like an adult.

155
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:42,923
Right.

156
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,137
Su-hyeon gave this to me last year
on Teachers' Day.

157
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,848
The two of them are quite similar.

158
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,731
What do you mean, they're "similar"?

159
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,901
They are both sweet on the inside.

160
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,363
Ha-bin received a cash prize
for winning the competition last year,

161
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,866
but she gave it to Su-hyeon.

162
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,328
Su-hyeon's family isn't very well-off.

163
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,206
She said I should tell Su-hyeon
that it's a scholarship

164
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,292
because Su-hyeon
wouldn't accept it from her.

165
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:24,381
By the way, how's Ha-bin doing lately?

166
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,134
She must still be devastated
about her mom.

167
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,192
If Jang Ha-bin's alibi isn't confirmed,
Captain Jang is off the case, right?

168
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,611
He has already violated
the investigative protocol.

169
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,488
Her alibi is a different matter.

170
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,657
Wait. Stop there.

171
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,326
They went in around 4:00 p.m. on the 11th.

172
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,827
When did they come out?

173
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,496
Not that night.

174
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,081
There.

175
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,249
It's the 13th.

176
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,752
That's the day
after we started the investigation.

177
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,840
Sir, is this the only exit
from this building?

178
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,467
Yes. I told you already.

179
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,927
11TH to 13TH
PARTY ROOM WITH HER BOYFRIEND

180
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,638
Could you replay the footage
one more time?

181
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,190
Could you show me the room they stayed in?

182
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,316
Fifth floor, right?

183
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,445
Jang Ha-bin said
she'd give her phone back,

184
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,739
so Min-a went out to get it.

185
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,035
That was the last day I saw her.

186
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,352
We confirmed your daughter's alibi.

187
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,690
I just confirmed it myself too.

188
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,194
You didn't tell us
when you saw her name on the list, right?

189
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:57,618
You should've at least
shared this with us when you found out

190
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:58,786
Song Min-a was the victim.

191
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,168
This is a clear breach
of the investigative protocol.

192
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:09,713
Right.

193
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,092
I'm sure you're aware
that this isn't something

194
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,928
that can be overlooked.

195
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,362
Did he say anything else?

196
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,073
I managed to smooth it over.

197
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,617
Tell me if he calls you again.

198
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,495
What are you doing this weekend?

199
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,831
The movie I like just came out.

200
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,583
Why aren't you asking me?

201
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,919
Ask you about what?

202
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,421
About why the police wanted to talk to you

203
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,091
and why my dad is suspicious of me.

204
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,217
Aren't you curious?

205
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,718
I'm sure you have your reasons.

206
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,849
What's wrong?

207
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:06,603
LEE SU-HYEON

208
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,106
Nothing.

209
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,858
It must've been really hard for you.

210
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:14,611
If my dad was a profiler,
I would've felt so suffocated.

211
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,739
There's an upside too.

212
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,369
It makes you a better liar.

213
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:28,292
Next is about the people
who had phone calls near the scene.

214
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:32,379
We've checked the alibis of everyone
who had phone calls nearby that day,

215
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,673
but we haven't found anyone suspicious.

216
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:40,095
However, we've encountered an issue
in this process.

217
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,306
An issue?

218
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,307
Wait.

219
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,267
What's wrong?

220
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,896
I'm sorry. I just found a familiar name.

221
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,397
Jang Ha-bin.

222
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,568
Who's that?

223
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,361
Well, she is--

224
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,739
Sir, the thing is--

225
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,199
Her alibi has been confirmed.

226
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,825
She has a valid alibi.

227
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,411
But at the precinct--

228
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,748
As Officer Lee suggests,
there were things to check out,

229
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,625
but she had a solid alibi for that day.

230
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,630
I think we can move on, Officer Lee.

231
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,549
Yes, sir.

232
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,969
If all alibis have been confirmed,
what's the issue?

233
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,096
Right.

234
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,432
One of the numbers
turned out to be a burner phone.

235
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,351
And it's hard to track that number.

236
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,561
Captain Jang,
is there anything you want to add?

237
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,691
No, sir.

238
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,488
Answer me! Did you interrogate
Park Ji-yeon thoroughly?

239
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:43,492
I definitely asked her if there was anyone
who was on bad terms with her.

240
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,994
Captain Jang said
we could send her back, so…

241
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,080
Hey. Enough.

242
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,625
Captain said we should just move on.

243
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,834
But…

244
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,086
Enough.

245
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,548
Officer Gu.

246
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,176
Did anyone in your team

247
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,929
review Park Ji-yeon's statement
other than Captain Jang?

248
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,306
No.

249
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,268
Captain Jang said he'd take care of it.
Why do you ask?

250
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,144
So we don't know for sure, then.

251
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,480
She isn't answering her phone.

252
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:14,690
I see.

253
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,985
What do we not know for sure, by the way?

254
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,654
It's been confirmed
by Detective Park and Captain Jang.

255
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:25,575
Captain Jang is unreliable at the moment.

256
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,246
The detectives have confirmed
his daughter's alibi.

257
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,873
Whether she's the culprit or not,

258
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,042
it's a fact that he hid
crucial information.

259
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,003
It's not like
he was covering up her crime.

260
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,171
What he did was understandable.

261
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,048
She's his family.

262
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,301
Are you covering for him now?

263
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,678
We're the police.
That was definitely out of line!

264
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:45,595
Hey, Team One.

265
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,932
-Team One.
-Yes, sir.

266
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,684
What are you doing?

267
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,436
Aren't you going to look for the kids?

268
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,688
Move!

269
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:56,606
I…

270
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:05,115
VIOLENT CRIME DIVISION 3-4

271
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,428
So you knew about this.

272
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:43,904
How's Choi Yeong-min?

273
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,490
He hasn't moved since yesterday afternoon.

274
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,409
What do you want to eat?

275
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,952
Anything to drink.

276
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,829
-Coffee?
-Sounds good.

277
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,165
Thanks.

278
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,959
This brat hasn't moved?

279
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,757
Can I ask you something?

280
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,300
What is it?

281
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,345
Why did you cover for him?

282
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:12,891
I mean, you don't like Captain Jang.

283
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,772
That man gets under my skin,

284
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:20,440
but he wouldn't mess with cases.

285
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,653
We need all the manpower
to catch the culprit.

286
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,738
No matter how annoying he is.

287
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,739
Right?

288
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,658
You're right.

289
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,535
Hold on.

290
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,079
That woman is
the owner of this house, right?

291
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,288
Yes.

292
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,876
Can you believe she has a son that age?

293
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:41,545
It's a little--

294
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:44,047
Stop distracting yourself
and focus on your job.

295
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,552
It'll be too late
if we miss Choi Yeong-min.

296
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,220
Hey.

297
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,514
Where are you now?

298
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:57,018
-Keep an eye on him.
-Yes, sir.

299
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,019
Yes.

300
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,815
What's wrong?

301
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,191
What?

302
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,359
Nothing.

303
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,820
Let's get inside.

304
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,919
Do-yun.

305
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,004
Yes?

306
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:28,675
So you're saying,

307
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:32,262
Captain Jang was the person
who took Song Min-a's records

308
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:36,016
and you found that out at the precinct.

309
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:36,933
Yes.

310
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,353
Then why did you lie to me?

311
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,024
I'm not sure why I did that.

312
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,362
Do you really think this is acceptable?

313
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,451
He breached the investigative protocol.

314
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:58,038
He should've backed out
when he found out his family was involved,

315
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,582
but her alibi has been confirmed and…

316
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,338
I just don't understand.

317
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,757
Both Captain Jang

318
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,343
and you, Officer Gu.

319
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,231
-I said I didn't do it!
-Enough.

320
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,690
-Be quiet.
-Geez.

321
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:28,818
Fine. Just be quiet and let's talk inside.

322
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,695
Let's talk inside.

323
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,683
Captain Jang is unreliable at the moment.

324
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,018
It's a fact that he hid
crucial information.

325
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,354
Could you please, for once…

326
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,359
just believe what I say?

327
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,230
RETRIEVAL

328
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:52,902
RETRIEVE YOUR BELONGINGS?

329
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,696
LOCKER

330
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,575
Wrong PIN.

331
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,996
PIN

332
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,165
Wrong PIN.

333
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,486
Did you get the answer
you were looking for?

334
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,284
I wonder what
Su-hyeon will think of me now.

335
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,330
The detectives already talked to him.

336
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,249
Did you really have to go…

337
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,420
and talk with him too?

338
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,887
I knew it'd hurt your feelings,

339
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,724
but I had to ask him.

340
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,187
Honestly, everything seemed suspicious.

341
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,525
You're talking as if it's not anymore.

342
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,905
You said
you didn't meet her on the 11th, right?

343
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:05,160
And that Song Min-a stole the phone.

344
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,913
I know you don't believe me.

345
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,294
I will.

346
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,345
I don't want…

347
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,225
to hurt you anymore.

348
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:47,702
Dad.

349
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:55,168
You should return to your office.
I'll follow you too.

350
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:02,884
Are you saying we should move?
Just like that?

351
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,761
Why do you ask?

352
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,389
Do you think I have other intentions?

353
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,685
Well, it's just too sudden.

354
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,270
Earlier, you said--

355
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,688
I didn't know…

356
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,485
but living in the house
where Mom lived with us

357
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,029
is actually quite hard.

358
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,491
I keep having negative thoughts here.

359
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:33,873
It might be better
to move to a new place with you.

360
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,715
Think about it and let me know.

361
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,825
I told you it was a bad idea.

362
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,702
I told you to come out.

363
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:13,371
Hey! Be quiet, you little bastards.

364
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,581
These darn punks.

365
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,667
Detective Cho,
take them to the interrogation room.

366
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,669
And call Officer Lee and Officer Gu.

367
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,296
Let's get out of the car now.

368
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,339
-I was going to.
-Hurry up and move.

369
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,008
Fine.

370
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,509
This is lame.

371
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,137
-Don't tell me what to do.
-Be quiet.

372
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,097
Come this way.

373
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:33,516
Hurry up.

374
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,769
This way. Hurry up. Move.

375
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,105
Where were the runaway kids hiding?

376
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,274
These sly punks.

377
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:44,485
They were staying in saunas and motels
to avoid the precinct's watch.

378
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,445
Gosh, I'm tired.

379
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:47,739
Thank you. We'll get ready to interrogate.

380
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,585
How many kids are there?

381
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:01,753
Let me see.

382
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:03,880
Seven.

383
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:07,300
We should interrogate them individually.

384
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:09,802
We don't have much time,
so let's split up.

385
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:10,970
Give me the papers.

386
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,601
Take two each.

387
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,605
-I'll take the rest.
-Yes, sir.

388
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,484
So you're joining us?

389
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:26,819
I'm not sure…

390
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,532
if it's a good idea to have you

391
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,577
lead this investigation.

392
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:54,097
How and when
did you first meet Song Min-a?

393
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:59,519
About one year ago,
when she joined our runaway kids' gang.

394
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:02,105
Write down what you did on the 11th.

395
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,732
Chronologically,
in as much detail as possible.

396
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:08,444
What was Song Min-a like?

397
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:11,072
She'd always talk about money.

398
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,867
-Everyone…
-They hated her.

399
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:18,913
-She'd lash out all the time.
-Don't you know the word, "anger issue?"

400
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,290
She was so annoying.

401
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,292
They're all similar.

402
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:28,172
On the fourth,
which was a week before the incident,

403
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,758
Song Min-a left the gang.

404
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,343
And on the day of the incident,

405
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:35,388
all the kids were in their house,
including Choi Yeong-min.

406
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:38,057
About what they ate,
what they did, and so on…

407
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,309
Their statements
are detailed and consistent.

408
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,353
Check this out.

409
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,565
Their words overlap too much.

410
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:46,607
CRAZY FOR MONEY

411
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,608
OBSESSED WITH MONEY

412
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,735
You're right.

413
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,447
Living together,
they might share similar vocabulary,

414
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,199
but they're even used in the same context

415
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,617
and in similar orders too.

416
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:01,539
What if the kids
are trying to get their stories straight?

417
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,833
Then we should find the weakest link.

418
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,227
If you look here,

419
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:27,648
she changed her negative comments
about Min-a multiple times.

420
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:34,447
She must've been emotionally close
to the victim.

421
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,284
You go in, Officer Gu.

422
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,912
She has a high level of anxiety.

423
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:45,166
Since you've talked with her already,
she'll be more comfortable with you.

424
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,753
Other than what you wrote here already,

425
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:52,256
is there anything else
you want to tell me?

426
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,886
That must be painful.

427
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,907
Based on what you wrote here,

428
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:21,828
it looks like everyone hated Min-a.

429
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,122
Is that right?

430
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,544
Yes.

431
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,421
What about you?

432
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,757
What did you think of her?

433
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,177
Did you hate her too?

434
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:44,475
Nobody is all bad, though.

435
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,269
I agree with you.

436
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,064
Then tell me, Eun-jin.

437
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,734
Why did you write it like this?

438
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:54,986
Well…

439
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,320
No reason.

440
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,115
I know you guys are trying
to get your stories straight.

441
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,077
Can you be honest with me?

442
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,373
I will make sure

443
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,917
nobody finds out about what you said.

444
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,169
I promise.

445
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:14,005
I will keep it a secret.

446
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,603
You agreed to say the same thing
with your friends, right?

447
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,356
-We were told…
-Yes.

448
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:38,070
…not to go home for now
and stay in hiding elsewhere.

449
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:39,947
By whom?

450
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,408
Who told you to do that?

451
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,370
Yeong-min.

452
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,789
I just finished my interrogation.

453
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,668
I don't know about other kids,
but I think I managed to smooth it over.

454
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,295
What about that bitch?

455
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,297
Did you find her?

456
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,342
Wrong PIN.

457
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,641
Wrong PIN.

458
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,959
Thank you.

459
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,043
Sure.

460
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:48,224
What was the relationship
between Choi Yeong-min and Min-a like?

461
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,478
It wasn't necessarily bad.

462
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,897
She's been in the gang for a while.

463
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:56,941
Although…

464
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,234
Although?

465
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,488
When Yeong-min figured out
that Min-a left the gang,

466
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:04,657
he got furious.

467
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,410
He said, when he finds her…

468
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,789
he's going to kill her.

469
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:23,718
Were you really
with Choi Yeong-min on the 11th?

470
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:33,686
Eun-jin.

471
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,647
You're not going to get in trouble.

472
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:39,650
You can trust me.

473
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,617
That day…

474
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,041
Yeong-min never came home.

475
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,086
It's all a lie.

476
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:08,012
Choi Yeong-min, come out.
I know you're in there.

477
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,597
Come out, you bastard!

478
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:20,608
Choi Yeong-min.

479
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,072
Choi Yeong-min!

480
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,449
-Is he not there?
-No.

481
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,743
Why on earth does he have
a smart lock on his room?

482
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,704
-Hey.
-Yes.

483
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,289
-Watch this door.
-Yes, sir.

484
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:50,930
Darn it.

485
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,066
Are they gone?

486
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,401
They're still there.

487
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,404
I think they know you're not in the house.

488
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,198
Fuck.

489
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:13,202
Why don't you just cooperate with them?

490
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:14,286
What?

491
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:18,124
Avoiding them
will make you look more suspicious.

492
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,463
Hey, say that again.

493
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:27,883
What did you say?

494
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,094
Do you think I'll go down alone
if they catch me?

495
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,597
Mom?

496
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,452
I'm coming.

497
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:22,521
I FOUND HER

498
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,488
According to her statement,

499
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:33,240
Choi Yeong-min and Song Min-a
weren't on good terms.

500
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,410
The important thing
is that Choi has no alibi for that day.

501
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,453
Right.

502
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:41,749
And it was very meticulous of him
to tell the kids to lie.

503
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,502
Choi Yeong-min, this brat,
is definitely suspicious.

504
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:47,379
The problem is
we don't have hard evidence.

505
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:48,380
Right.

506
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,301
There must be an accomplice.

507
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,721
Whether Choi Yeong-min
is the culprit or not.

508
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:57,640
How do you know?

509
00:41:57,723 --> 00:42:00,267
Taking care of a dead body
within just a few hours

510
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,561
and digging a hole can't be done alone.

511
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:05,689
The crime scene also suggests

512
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:08,817
that the culprit
was both meticulous and disorganized.

513
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,111
I looked into
Choi Yeong-min's credit card record

514
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,239
to locate him, but I found nothing.

515
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,367
It's hard to stay hidden
without someone's help.

516
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:21,747
Our top priority now should be
studying people around Choi Yeong-min.

517
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,791
Someone's definitely helping him.

518
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:51,735
How can I help you?

519
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,905
I just wanted to give you some snacks.

520
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,366
I'm on duty now. I'm sorry.

521
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,450
Wait.

522
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:01,078
But you haven't even eaten yet, right?

523
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,830
I have.

524
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,415
Well, thanks.

525
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,503
It's nothing.

526
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,505
Sure. Thank you.

527
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,187
See if you can find
Choi Yeong-min's record here.

528
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,481
-Okay.
-Gosh, this case is killing me.

529
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,525
-Have you heard from Detective Cho?
-Not yet.

530
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,444
I asked him to keep us posted.

531
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,321
And the CCTV near the runaways' house?

532
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:36,989
There are none pointing at their house.

533
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,616
All right. Thanks.

534
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,120
How many phones are registered
under Choi Yeong-min's name?

535
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,955
I was going to do it
after checking the CCTVs.

536
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,540
Call me when you find something.

537
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:47,583
Keep a close eye on them.

538
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,418
Not yet? It's been forever.

539
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,963
I was waiting
because it seemed like a burner phone.

540
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,383
-I'm sorry. I'll hurry.
-Okay.

541
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:16,403
I'm not sure
if it's a good idea to have you

542
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,489
lead this investigation.

543
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,791
Check these too.

544
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:31,585
I marked the relevant parts.
I'm sure they'll help.

545
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:35,506
And I sent
the handover plan to your emails.

546
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:38,467
-What?
-Call me if you have any questions.

547
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,968
Captain Jang.

548
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:53,690
Are you stepping down from this case?

549
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:54,775
Yes.

550
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:56,985
Is it because of what I said?

551
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,445
No.

552
00:44:58,529 --> 00:44:59,822
You're right.

553
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:03,617
I could ruin this investigation.

554
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:08,330
Perhaps, I already have.

555
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,094
I want to sell my house.

556
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,639
As soon as possible.

557
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,601
Thanks. Please call me back.

558
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:56,462
Hello.

559
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,381
Is this Jang Tae-su's phone?

560
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,342
Yes. Who is this?

561
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,888
You left your name card on my car.

562
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,932
My car was parked near Semyeong Building.

563
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:13,061
Your memo says that you needed
my dashcam footage for the investigation.

564
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:17,399
Hello?

565
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:19,776
Why isn't he saying anything?

566
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,737
Are you really a cop?

567
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,406
Yes, I am.

568
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,534
I'm still nearby.

569
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,454
If you want to check it, please hurry.

570
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,464
There you go.

571
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:42,090
Thank you.

572
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:33,994
So what?

573
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,581
Does this footage
mean Ha-bin killed someone?

574
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,710
It doesn't, right?

575
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:45,422
She wasn't with me that day,
but it doesn't make her a murderer.

576
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:48,300
Do you really think
what you're doing is good for her?

577
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:54,806
Tell me all about
what actually happened that day.

578
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:00,062
She went out to meet Song Min-a, right?

579
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,523
She didn't tell me where she was going.

580
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:05,901
I don't even know who she is.

581
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,238
What about Choi Yeong-min?

582
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,866
I've never heard of that name.

583
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,411
Do you know anyone who might know?

584
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,455
Does she have any other close friends?

585
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:21,291
I don't know. I was just transferred.

586
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:27,547
Weren't you
in the same class as her last year?

587
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,218
I transferred this year.

588
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,231
It was a misunderstanding.

589
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:47,192
The Su-hyeon
I was talking about is a girl.

590
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,411
They were best friends in tenth grade.

591
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:02,332
-This girl's name is Lee Su-hyeon too?
-Yes.

592
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,419
There was another student named Su-hyeon.

593
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,339
I'm teaching 12th graders this year,
so I didn't know.

594
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:12,551
Can I get her contact information?

595
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:17,139
I can give you her address,

596
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,266
but it won't be easy to meet her.

597
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:21,977
She dropped out of school.

598
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,604
Her phone number's not working either.

599
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,398
I went to her house to meet her,

600
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,734
but she ran away.

601
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,028
She ran away?

602
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,976
PAYMENT REMINDER

603
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:23,121
-What proof?
-I don't know either.

604
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:26,875
-And he asked me if I knew someone.
-Song Min-a?

605
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:30,629
No, it was a man's name.

606
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:32,672
It was Choi something.

607
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,090
Choi Yeong-min?

608
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:36,802
Yes, he asked me if I knew Choi Yeong-min.

609
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,348
Why are you looking for that brat?

610
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,225
I want to ask her something.

611
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,145
Has she not come back home yet?

612
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:49,356
Once she runs out of money, she might.

613
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,736
Have you seen this girl?

614
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,447
She was Su-hyeon's friend.

615
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:02,369
Do you know her?

616
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:05,455
She ran away too, right?

617
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,584
I bet she did.

618
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,628
What do you mean?

619
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:18,844
Whenever this girl called her,
Su-hyeon would go out, no matter the time.

620
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:21,012
I have no idea what they did out there,

621
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:23,098
but she'd come back
with her eyes all sunken.

622
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,892
She'd seem out of her mind.

623
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:29,479
Then she ran away from home.

624
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:52,252
You can stop here.
Your home is in the opposite direction.

625
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,462
Okay.

626
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:56,423
Hold on.

627
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:01,720
I noticed your usual key chain

628
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:03,972
was gone.

629
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,058
Do you like it?

630
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:08,935
Yes.

631
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:13,315
Let me put it on your bag.

632
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:27,037
It's cute.

633
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:02,405
You're home.

634
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:06,910
How's your arm?

635
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,955
It's okay now.

636
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:20,382
You changed the key chain.

637
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,304
Yes, Su-hyeon gave it to me.

638
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,808
The one you had before

639
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,227
was from Su-hyeon too.

640
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:36,940
How did you know?

641
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,159
Someone told me…

642
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:53,206
at your school.

643
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:57,252
Is that so?

644
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:03,675
Have you thought about
what I said the other day?

645
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,220
About moving?

646
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:10,473
I did.

647
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,394
But I should solve this case first.

648
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:20,483
Does it have to be done by you?

649
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:24,779
I'm going to catch

650
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,241
the real culprit.

651
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:41,254
Let's think about the move…

652
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,134
another time.

653
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:52,599
Okay.

654
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:56,686
Ha-bin.

655
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,234
If you have anything to tell me…

656
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:06,654
I'm all ears.

657
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:10,492
Okay.

658
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:19,978
You thought
I wouldn't be able to find you?

659
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:22,939
I'm so sorry, Yeong-min.

660
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:24,232
Ji-yeon.

661
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,360
I have eyes on you everywhere.

662
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,404
Please forgive me.
I'll never do this again.

663
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:31,072
-Where is it?
-I don't know.

664
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,702
-I don't know!
-Where's my money Song Min-a took?

665
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,454
Where is it?

666
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,832
Type your PIN.

667
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,251
Type your PIN.

668
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:44,836
PIN

669
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:45,837
WRONG PIN
PLEASE TRY AGAIN

670
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,340
SELF-SERVICE LOCKERS

671
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,385
Type your PIN.

672
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,054
Type your PIN.

673
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,849
Damn it.

674
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,225
ENTER PIN

675
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,728
Type your PIN.

676
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,024
Type your PIN.

677
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,776
God damn it.

678
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:10,904
Excuse me.

679
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:12,405
What are you looking for?

680
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:15,158
Hey!

681
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:17,118
What…

682
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,414
Is this the police?

683
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:23,541
SELF-SERVICE LOCKERS

684
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,251
What is he looking for?

685
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,337
Could he be dealing drugs?

686
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,339
This might be their drop spot.

687
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:32,884
It means someone put something there.

688
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,512
Hey.

689
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,223
Where?

690
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:42,352
SENIOR INSPECTOR JANG TAE-SU'S
ACCURATE PROFILING

691
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,627
Type your PIN.

692
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:15,510
NO NAME

693
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:33,945
I have something to tell you.

694
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:36,322
Could you drop me off at the library?

695
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,532
Okay.

696
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:42,203
I'll be waiting in the car.
Come out when you're ready.

697
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:34,380
What is it?

698
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,010
Right.

699
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,140
Good luck with the case.

700
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:50,396
And I hope you catch the real culprit.

701
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:54,859
Thanks.

702
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:32,331
We found Choi Yeong-min.
We're at Seopyeong Station now.

703
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,218
Screen doors opening.

704
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:54,604
Excuse me.

705
01:02:57,982 --> 01:02:59,525
Yes. He's going outside.

706
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:01,611
Okay.

707
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,446
Sorry.

708
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:13,414
What's this?

709
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:15,374
Could you check if this matches

710
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:18,002
with the microfiber that we found
at the car accident?

711
01:03:18,085 --> 01:03:19,629
Where did you get it?

712
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:24,300
How long will it take?

713
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:27,637
I'll try to do it as fast as I can.

714
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,597
RED KEY CHAIN

715
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,164
I told you we'd meet again.

716
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:57,416
Come on up.

717
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,168
Hurry up, you bastard!

718
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:01,254
Damn it.

719
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:05,633
Fuck.

720
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:19,438
Should Officer Lee and I interrogate him?

721
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,482
No, I'll do it myself.

722
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:23,442
But let's have a meeting first.

723
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,945
Pull up everything
we have on Choi Yeong-min.

724
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:34,245
We got a tip-off nearby.

725
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:36,372
We didn't hear anything about the context.

726
01:04:36,455 --> 01:04:39,417
This is just too sudden.

727
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,460
We're working here. You can't just…

728
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:44,547
-Detective Kim.
-Are you always pushy like this?

729
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:47,133
Come on. Please be understanding.

730
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:50,136
We're just doing our job
for the Audit Team.

731
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,805
We'll make it quick.

732
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:55,975
What's going on?

733
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:58,561
Captain Jang Tae-su, right?

734
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:00,396
Yes, that's me.

735
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:04,650
There has been a report of bribery.
Please cooperate with our investigation.

736
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:12,241
-Did you find anything?
-Not yet.

737
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,295
Are you going to keep denying it?

738
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:27,173
The amount of money
the informant mentioned

739
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:29,800
matches the amount of money
found in your trunk.

740
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:32,803
I don't know anything about this.
I've never received the money.

741
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:35,556
You'll be suspended
until this matter is resolved.

742
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,017
We finally caught the suspect and…

743
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:42,104
No, sir.

744
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:44,941
Okay.

745
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:48,736
Darn it.

746
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:50,780
Darn this.

747
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:52,490
Captain Jang is suspended.

748
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:54,450
You two go in.

749
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:56,744
I'm investigating a case now.

750
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:59,956
From this moment on, you need
to step away from the investigation.

751
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:01,832
But who made this report…

752
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:05,544
And I hope you catch the real culprit.

753
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:15,137
Got any proof?

754
01:06:18,015 --> 01:06:20,434
Why did you delete the dashcam footage?

755
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:22,436
I didn't.

756
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,564
It just doesn't make sense
that I received a bribe

757
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:27,733
from a victim
of a case from two years ago.

758
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:32,405
You can't just harass an innocent citizen
without any evidence.

759
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:43,457
Have a good day.

760
01:06:57,221 --> 01:06:59,390
What a busy man.

761
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:02,643
Well, he should be.

762
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:06,522
Do you know Captain Jang?

763
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:20,745
Officer Gu.

764
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:23,122
Where's Choi Yeong-min?

765
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:25,458
I'm sorry, Captain.

766
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:29,754
I'm sorry.

767
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:36,010
Captain Jang.

768
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,153
They match.

769
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:57,448
What do you mean we found evidence?

770
01:07:57,531 --> 01:07:59,825
The microfiber we found
at the car accident scene.

771
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:02,161
It's the same as the evidence he gave me.

772
01:08:06,665 --> 01:08:08,793
Are you sure?

773
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:11,295
Could they be just similar--

774
01:08:11,378 --> 01:08:12,755
They're identical.

775
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:16,050
What's important is
we found the skeleton's DNA here.

776
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:23,224
What? What did you just say?

777
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:26,227
The skeleton found in the mountain.

778
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:28,145
We found its DNA here.

779
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:44,120
Are you saying
this could be a serial killer case?

780
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:47,414
One piece of evidence
for two separate cases.

781
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,084
The two cases are definitely related.

782
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:57,341
There could have been
another victim before Song Min-a.

783
01:09:18,362 --> 01:09:19,572
Captain Jang.

784
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:24,827
Where did you get this evidence?

785
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:15,586
I wonder who sent the evidence.

786
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:16,503
Your key chain…

787
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:18,255
You really didn't know?

788
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:21,091
Do you know Ha-bin?

789
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:23,177
She's your daughter, right?

790
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,387
I'm curious myself.

791
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:28,641
Why is your daughter so obsessed with me?

792
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,726
-Jang Ha-bin, get out.
-Excuse me.

793
01:10:30,809 --> 01:10:32,394
You've lost your mind.

794
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:33,729
Running away won't solve anything.

795
01:10:33,812 --> 01:10:34,813
Dad.

796
01:10:37,274 --> 01:10:38,692
How can you be so sure?

797
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:47,159
