1
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,443
Su-hyeon.

2
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,574
Ms. Kim.

3
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,205
Su-hyeon, are you okay?

4
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,166
Drink this.

5
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,064
Su-hyeon.

6
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,317
Why don't you just do as Yeong-min says?

7
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,531
Ms. Kim.

8
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,201
Do you have any idea

9
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,455
what he's making me and the kids do?

10
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,127
We're committing crimes, Ms. Kim.

11
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,253
Su-hyeon.

12
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,131
But we're able to stay here
thanks to Yeong-min--

13
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,091
Please let me out of here.

14
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,388
Ms. Kim, please.

15
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:04,767
Please. Help me get out of here.

16
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,437
Please, Ms. Kim.

17
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,188
But if Yeong-min finds out,

18
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,733
-he's going to harm me and Do-yun.
-No.

19
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,484
I can't. I have to think about Do-yun.

20
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,652
I'm sorry.

21
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,363
Wait, Ms. Kim.

22
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,823
Ms. Kim.

23
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,576
Ms. Kim.

24
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,314
Yeong-min might show up soon.

25
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,650
You should go, Do-yun.

26
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,319
Now.

27
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,529
Run away, Su-hyeon.

28
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,035
Come on.

29
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,047
How's Lee Su-hyeon doing?

30
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,507
Let's leave her alone for the time being.

31
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,301
I don't think she'll listen to you.

32
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:46,220
No matter how much I beat her,

33
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,930
that bitch doesn't seem to get the point.

34
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,934
Forcing her to go out and work
might actually cause more problems.

35
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,854
It's best to just leave her be for now.

36
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:58,107
I'm going to beat
some sense into her soon.

37
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,817
So just keep up with the acting.

38
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,530
What was that sound?

39
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,335
Fuck.

40
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,419
Yeong-min.

41
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:48,699
Excuse me.

42
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,869
Can I charge my phone here?

43
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,846
DAD

44
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,523
CONTACT
LEE SU-HYEON

45
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,612
LEE SU-HYEON

46
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,242
HA-BIN

47
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:35,288
HA-BIN

48
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:41,752
CALLING
HA-BIN

49
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,177
Pick up, Ha-bin…

50
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:51,762
Come on…

51
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:55,808
Ha-bin.

52
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,645
It's me.

53
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,277
I have something to tell you in person.

54
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,906
Can we meet?

55
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,036
What was your relationship with Su-hyeon?

56
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,830
We were close in school.

57
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,707
What about after Su-hyeon ran away?

58
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,501
I've never met her since.

59
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,005
The day she died,

60
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:28,716
she was with you.

61
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,012
We found evidence that suggests

62
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,598
you, Su-hyeon, and Ms. Yoon
were together that day.

63
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,521
Do you think I killed Su-hyeon?

64
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:46,984
Why would I?

65
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,238
Since Su-hyeon ran away from home,

66
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,240
you called her dozens of times every day.

67
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,659
Why did you do that?

68
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,578
I was worried.

69
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,872
She was my friend.

70
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,500
Did you think of her as
a friend or your possession?

71
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,962
You just got mad

72
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,048
because she cut you off.

73
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,867
I know you were here too.

74
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,958
Where did…

75
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,962
Su-hyeon die?

76
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:06,897
Sir.

77
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,941
I think this is where Lee was murdered.

78
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,239
Team 3 and 4, go and see
if there's anything left in there.

79
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,950
Team Two and Detective Cho
will check the CCTVs with me.

80
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:18,868
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

81
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,286
I'll go this way.

82
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,830
-Call me if you find something.
-I went there to meet her.

83
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,291
She wasn't there, so I came back.

84
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,794
Did you call her to ask where she was?

85
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,212
No.

86
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:34,759
There's no record of you
calling her since that day,

87
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:40,348
as if you knew that she was dead.

88
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:52,943
Is there any proof that I killed her?

89
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,165
Hey, Detective Kim.

90
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:10,836
Which CCTV?

91
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,714
I found a CCTV by the road
connected to the scene.

92
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,675
But some woman bought the entire
hard drive of this CCTV last year.

93
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,429
Check if that was Yoon Ji-su.

94
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,526
Are you saying

95
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,946
that I deliberately lured my mom out?

96
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,116
Just like you planned to use Captain Jang
to get away with murder,

97
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,577
you used your mom to get rid of

98
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,705
Lee Su-hyeon's body, didn't you?

99
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:55,339
Ms. Yoon definitely saw you
that day at the scene.

100
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,052
She decided to bury the body herself

101
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,431
because she was certain
that you killed her.

102
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,142
There must be a reason for that.

103
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,021
I know what you think of me.

104
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,358
Those eyes.

105
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,402
I've seen that a lot.

106
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,738
Su-hyeon was afraid of me…

107
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:26,704
and Mom thought I killed her…

108
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,331
for the same reason.

109
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,418
Because I'm not normal.

110
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,176
Did you double-check?

111
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,305
Okay.

112
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:48,851
It's been confirmed

113
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,354
that Ms. Yoon destroyed the CCTV evidence.

114
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,527
Are you still going to deny it?

115
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:04,867
Look. I have a child too,
so I understand how you must be feeling.

116
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,996
But you must convince her to confess.

117
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,042
You know that's the best you can do.

118
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:26,931
So you saw everything.

119
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,897
I know you have questions to ask,
so go ahead.

120
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,986
Do you want to know how I killed Su-hyeon?

121
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:42,863
Or…

122
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:47,743
do you want me to tell you
how I was going to use you?

123
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,413
Ha-bin.

124
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,294
It must have been rough…

125
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:04,927
seeing people look at you like that.

126
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,353
I believe you.

127
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,115
I will prove your innocence…

128
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,952
and catch the real culprit.

129
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,552
She says she didn't see Lee.

130
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,055
Do you really believe that?

131
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:54,018
Ha-bin isn't an ordinary kid.

132
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,646
That's why my wife and I suspected her

133
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,691
and my wife even made a wrong choice
because of that.

134
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:01,901
If you know that,

135
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:06,697
why are you acting
just like Ms. Yoon right now?

136
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:12,369
Are you sure Ha-bin is the culprit?

137
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:14,663
Yes.

138
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,373
Then go ahead and suspect her.

139
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,292
But before that,

140
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,420
why don't you
question your confidence first?

141
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,103
Hello.

142
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,272
Hi, Do-yun.

143
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,108
Thanks for coming.

144
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:49,031
Do-yun seems a little anxious today.

145
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,201
Can I join him for the interview?

146
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,454
You're his guardian, so yes, you can.

147
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,416
Do-yun, your mom will join us.

148
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:01,752
Okay.

149
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,922
-Officer Gu.
-Yes?

150
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,550
I would like to invite you over
for a meal sometime.

151
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,511
-Well, Ma'am…
-I'm just so thankful.

152
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,013
It's okay. I really appreciate it, though.

153
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,599
Please let me know
if you're ever around my neighborhood.

154
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,809
Will do.

155
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,645
Please take it.

156
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,230
Thanks.

157
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,107
Do-yun.

158
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,733
Hello.

159
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,360
Are you feeling anxious?

160
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,450
Come on. It's okay.

161
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,248
I can't right now.

162
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,583
Shall we go first?

163
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,460
You can hang out with me.

164
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:47,965
What's wrong?

165
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,509
Don't come.

166
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:52,428
Sorry?

167
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,975
Don't eat…

168
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,728
what Mom gives to you.

169
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,690
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

170
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,358
Shall we go now?

171
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,193
Yes, let's go upstairs.

172
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:09,903
Let's go.

173
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:14,908
Do-yun.

174
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,662
You said that

175
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:23,500
you mixed the candy into the juice
and gave it to Min-a, right?

176
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,713
-Yes.
-Where did you give it to her?

177
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,301
In the kitchen.

178
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,429
Then did Min-a
collapse in the kitchen too?

179
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,019
You said you couldn't find Min-a

180
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,314
so you opened the door to my room,
and she was there.

181
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,444
Min-a was…

182
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,364
passed out in Mom's bedroom.

183
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,496
What were you doing then?

184
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,793
I was drawing in the living room.

185
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,921
While you were drawing in the living room,

186
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,924
did you not notice
Min-a going into the bedroom?

187
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,387
Do-yun, you must be so nervous.

188
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,307
You went to the bathroom,
and she was gone when you got back.

189
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,894
She's right.

190
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,522
I was in the bathroom, so--

191
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,232
Sorry, Do-yun. One second.

192
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,569
Ms. Kim, I'm very sorry,

193
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,696
-but I'd like you to leave.
-Pardon?

194
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,116
You're disrupting the interview.

195
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,247
-Officer Gu.
-Please come out.

196
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,498
Do-yun, let's take a break.

197
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,174
-But--
-Please don't say anything and leave.

198
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,528
The CCTV hard drive that Yoon took
must've been destroyed already, right?

199
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,905
Even if it wasn't,
Jang Tae-su will not cooperate.

200
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,907
We must find another piece of evidence.

201
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,200
Captain.

202
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:24,121
We're looking into the record
of all the calls made on the day Lee died,

203
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,957
and we found
Choi's old burner phone number.

204
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,002
He filmed the video.
Of course, he was there.

205
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:34,006
Why hasn't anyone thought
of checking this obvious fact?

206
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,925
CHOI YEONG-MIN'S PHONE NUMBER

207
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,598
HWAUN DISTRICT CALL LOGS

208
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,974
NO MATCHING DATA

209
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,937
NO MATCHING DATA

210
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,322
Did something happen in the interview?

211
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,202
I might have missed something.

212
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,079
Are you suspecting Kim Seong-hui?

213
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:09,708
Yes.

214
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,961
Two of Choi's burner phones had calls
on the day Lee died

215
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,714
according to the list
from the cell tower in the area.

216
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:21,720
One phone made the call,
and the other received it.

217
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,097
There was one more person who was

218
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:26,725
using Choi's burner phone.

219
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,436
Like Captain Jang said,

220
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,856
do you think Kim Seong-hui is the culprit?

221
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,363
I need more information.

222
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,784
You must've been hungry. Eat up.

223
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:50,040
You threw up
in the bathroom the other day.

224
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,043
Does it happen a lot?

225
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,255
Yes.

226
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,423
Sometimes.

227
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,802
When do you get sick like that?

228
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,513
After you eat?

229
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:15,732
Earlier, you said I shouldn't eat
what your mom gives me.

230
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,236
Why did you say that?

231
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,916
Would you like some candy too?

232
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:35,836
Go on.

233
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,924
You haven't seen this candy, have you?

234
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:46,638
This is the candy
you said you gave to Min-a.

235
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,565
Please take care of this for me. Thanks.

236
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,733
Wait, Detective.

237
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,655
When can I meet Seong-hui?

238
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:05,907
Well…

239
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,910
Then please tell me
how Min-a died at least.

240
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,748
It was acute intoxication.

241
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,168
Intoxication from what?

242
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:21,298
-And who…
-It's still under investigation.

243
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,632
You'll find out later.

244
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:26,762
Wait.

245
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,182
I have something to tell you.

246
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:41,568
If what Park said is true,
it means Kim Seong-hui killed Choi too.

247
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,278
Can we let her go like that?

248
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:45,322
We have no evidence.

249
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:49,284
What if Park is just regretting
that he turned himself in?

250
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,413
Have a few officers keep tabs on her.

251
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,664
Yes, sir.

252
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,898
I'm not saying

253
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,693
Kim Seong-hui is the culprit
to save my daughter.

254
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,906
The three crimes

255
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,743
were committed
by the same person, one after another.

256
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,748
Now we know
that Jang Ha-bin isn't the culprit either.

257
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,170
So you think all three of them
were murdered by Kim?

258
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,048
Yes.

259
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:53,431
Because I've been lying to you
and keeping things from you,

260
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,059
I ruined this investigation.

261
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,357
Is there a way to arrest Kim?

262
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:18,999
Mom took the CCTV hard drive
from near where Su-hyeon died.

263
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:25,630
Can you tell me everything
you remember about what happened

264
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,048
before she died?

265
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,847
We need to know what she did,

266
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:37,058
what she was thinking,
and why she believed that

267
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,519
you killed Su-hyeon.

268
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:43,023
Tell me what's going on first.

269
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,173
You know

270
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,259
Kim Seong-hui, right?

271
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,261
Kim has been arrested before,

272
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,347
so she must have been on high alert.

273
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:20,227
I think she hid the money
somewhere near the house, not inside it.

274
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,562
We must find that money first.

275
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,898
-Get on it now.
-Yes, sir.

276
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,900
-Look everywhere it could be hidden.
-Yes, sir.

277
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,704
Before your mom died,

278
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,249
did you notice any change?

279
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:02,602
Mom.

280
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:15,240
I think she started to write something.

281
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:18,868
Like a diary?

282
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,037
No.

283
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,208
It looked like a letter.

284
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,169
But I'm not sure.

285
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,884
I see. Anything else?

286
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:38,596
Before she died…

287
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,351
she often went to the columbarium
where Ha-jun's urn is.

288
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,572
She thought I killed Ha-jun as well…

289
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,493
after believing I had killed Su-hyeon.

290
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,290
That's probably why she went there.

291
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:20,138
LATE JANG HA-JUN

292
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,350
Do you think

293
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,436
Mom had a hard time?

294
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,523
She was not like me.

295
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:38,656
She could've just asked me…

296
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,577
if I killed Lee Su-hyeon.

297
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:01,596
Is this…

298
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:16,569
Su-hyeon used to run track, right?

299
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,142
SU-HYEON, I'M SO SORRY

300
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,768
Su-hyeon.

301
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,022
I'm…

302
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:56,443
so sorry.

303
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,407
If I had moved faster…

304
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,828
to follow Ha-bin that day…

305
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,207
would you still be alive?

306
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,050
Su-hyeon?

307
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,222
Why?

308
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,853
Okay. I'll be right there.

309
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:01,174
SU-HYEON

310
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,260
SU-HYEON

311
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,207
Ha-bin…

312
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,148
Su-hyeon.

313
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,108
Su-hyeon?

314
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:29,275
I saw your daughter kill Lee Su-hyeon.

315
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,402
Bring the money to the mountain

316
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,363
where you buried Lee's body,
before I call the police.

317
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,693
I guess this is my karma…

318
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,906
for doing you wrong.

319
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,504
MOM, YOUR DEPRESSION
IS GETTING WORSE

320
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,631
IT COULD BE THE MEDICATION
TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

321
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,931
TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION

322
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,270
WHEN DID MOM'S DEPRESSION BEGIN?

323
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,732
DEPRESSION SURVIVORS

324
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,200
But you know what, Su-hyeon?

325
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,620
I'm starting to feel like…

326
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,877
it might not have been Ha-bin
who did this to you.

327
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:26,267
OWL SUPERMARKET

328
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,005
It's you.

329
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:42,510
Who are you?

330
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:46,764
You're the person blackmailing me.

331
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,981
I saw you on the CCTV footage
from the grocery store.

332
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:02,905
What were you doing there that day?

333
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:07,785
Was Su-hyeon…

334
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:13,666
really killed by Ha-bin?

335
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,088
-Was it perhaps--
-I saw it with my own eyes.

336
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,923
Your daughter killed Su-hyeon.

337
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,180
But even if

338
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,851
she wasn't killed by your daughter,
the situation looks bad.

339
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,605
The mom buried the body,
thinking her daughter was a murderer.

340
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,568
She'd be devastated to learn that.

341
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,503
But I just can't

342
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:03,299
bring myself to ask Ha-bin.

343
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,846
I don't have the courage
to hear that she killed you…

344
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,268
or to tell her that I thought she did.

345
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,147
I'm so sorry, Su-hyeon.

346
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,235
I'll pay for how I wronged you…

347
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,948
with my own life.

348
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:17,581
LATE YOON JI-SU

349
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:35,266
If I were your mom,
I would have never thrown away that CCTV.

350
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,893
Once we find that,

351
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,937
we can prove that Kim is guilty.

352
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,232
I was mistaken again.

353
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,528
I thought we were on the same page.

354
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,197
After seeing all that,

355
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,992
you still want to arrest Kim Seong-hui

356
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,244
instead of getting revenge?

357
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,624
-Ha-bin.
-You're not supposed to be like that.

358
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,044
Mom suspected me

359
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:07,339
and couldn't even ask if I killed Su-hyeon

360
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,258
because of you.

361
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,807
Do you have any idea how our lives were?

362
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,560
After Ha-jun died,

363
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,897
Mom became mentally ill.

364
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,692
Whenever she anxiously looked at me…

365
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,488
I didn't want her to suspect me either,

366
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,324
so I tried so hard
to live like a normal person.

367
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:37,203
You abandoned Mom when she had depression

368
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:40,039
and never looked back.

369
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:42,875
So why now?

370
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,421
You think arresting her
will free you from the guilt?

371
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,843
Mom was…

372
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,555
killed by you.

373
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:15,699
CAPTAIN OH JEONG-HWAN

374
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,664
If you feel
even the slightest guilt toward her…

375
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:27,211
don't arrest Kim Seong-hui.

376
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,895
Have you seen this person?

377
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,730
Have you seen this person here?

378
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,237
-No?
-No.

379
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,876
Sir, it's here!

380
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,100
About the money that disappeared…

381
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:29,189
It's been confirmed that you hid it.

382
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:37,364
You killed Choi because of money, right?

383
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,992
It's true that I took the money,

384
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,871
but I didn't kill Yeong-min.

385
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,290
Are you freaking kidding me?

386
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,711
This won't do. Where's Kwon Do-yun now?

387
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,007
Here.

388
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,427
Why is she taking Do-yun with her?

389
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:02,848
Does Ha-bin know that Kim is the culprit?

390
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,394
Is she seeking revenge?

391
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:14,360
Kim is the one
who committed the crime. So why…

392
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,071
She lost her mom
because Kim blackmailed her.

393
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:19,490
She might want to use Do-yun

394
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,742
to give her the same pain.

395
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,663
Captain.

396
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:28,374
-Kwon Do-yun's phone just turned on.
-Where is the location?

397
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,167
Some empty land. It's not far.

398
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:33,087
We have Kwon's location now.
Let's go find him.

399
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,630
Stop the investigation on Kim.

400
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,924
Gather all available search teams
and get moving.

401
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,259
Yes, sir. Hey, follow me.
Did you tell Team Two?

402
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,386
Yes, sir.

403
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,055
Captain.

404
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,415
Are you…

405
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,252
really Su-hyeon's friend?

406
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,212
Yes.

407
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:20,300
Su-hyeon wanted me to bring you to her
because she misses you.

408
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,822
Don't arrest Kim Seong-hui.

409
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:15,767
Ha-bin.

410
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:25,796
Please.

411
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:35,389
You're right.

412
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,600
I killed your mom.

413
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,901
The person you want to kill

414
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,112
isn't that woman.

415
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,154
It's me.

416
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,950
Good that you know. Now, move.

417
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,748
I can't stop here.

418
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:06,837
You know what kind of person I am.

419
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,344
That's why you left.

420
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:19,933
Because I'm a monster…

421
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:23,520
you abandoned me.

422
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,281
I didn't abandon you.

423
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,618
I ran away.

424
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,332
I was too scared…

425
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,336
to confront my doubt.

426
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,299
That's why I ran away.

427
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:10,609
Ha-bin.

428
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:19,201
Did you kill Ha-jun?

429
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:32,380
I didn't.

430
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:51,066
Yes, I know.

431
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:59,241
Sorry, I asked you too late.

432
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:06,456
I'm sorry, Ha-bin.

433
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,418
I'm so sorry.

434
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:14,923
I'm sorry.

435
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,513
I'm sorry.

436
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,684
Please…

437
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:28,854
forgive me.

438
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,361
I'm sorry.

439
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,254
Do-yun!

440
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:57,883
Do-yun!

441
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,344
Do-yun!

442
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,971
Do-yun!

443
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:10,854
Do-yun.

444
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:14,608
What were you doing here?

445
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:21,740
Can I give you a hug?

446
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:37,923
The day Lee Su-hyeon died,

447
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:40,508
you went to the abandoned factory.

448
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:47,474
What happened there?

449
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:51,561
That day,

450
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:55,482
Yeong-min beat Su-hyeon badly.

451
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:01,821
Su-hyeon ran away,
and Yeong-min chased her.

452
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:06,326
I was worried something really bad
might happen to her,

453
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,620
so I followed them.

454
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,872
OWL SUPERMARKET

455
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:13,458
You followed them all the way there

456
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:15,168
to help Lee Su-hyeon?

457
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:21,883
I couldn't just sit and watch that girl

458
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,679
running away, looking like a mess.

459
00:54:59,045 --> 00:54:59,879
Su-hyeon.

460
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:04,175
What are you doing here? Let's go home.

461
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:10,098
All this time,
I thought you were a good person.

462
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,436
But you were on Choi Yeong-min's side?

463
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:15,562
What are you saying?

464
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,606
You've been taking advantage of us,
acting like you care about us!

465
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:23,028
I'm going to tell others about this.

466
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:29,993
Su-hyeon.

467
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,287
-Come on, Su-hyeon.
-Don't touch me!

468
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:39,419
Get any closer,

469
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:41,504
and I'll call the cops.

470
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,507
I think there's some misunderstanding.

471
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:48,595
Okay. I won't follow you.

472
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,756
But Yeong-min did say

473
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,383
that he saw some girl

474
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:30,637
killing Su-hyeon.

475
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,847
He said then some lady showed up

476
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:35,892
and took…

477
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:44,192
She took the body with her
and he showed me a video of it.

478
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:50,115
Then have you watched this video too?

479
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,090
Su-hyeon.

480
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:11,803
Su-hyeon.

481
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:16,891
This is the video
that was deleted from Choi's phone.

482
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:18,768
We restored it.

483
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:33,366
Su-hyeon.

484
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:43,751
Su-hyeon.

485
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:59,100
Su-hyeon.

486
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:11,905
Su-hyeon?

487
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,210
Su-hyeon.

488
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:30,798
Su-hyeon.

489
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:21,594
Yeong-min.

490
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:24,597
Some woman

491
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,558
killed Lee Su-hyeon.

492
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:31,229
That means Yeong-min lied to me.

493
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:33,856
How could he blackmail the lady…

494
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:39,612
when he was the one who killed her?

495
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:43,116
It was you who killed her, not Choi.

496
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,952
Then you filmed the body.

497
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:52,667
That burner phone belonged to Choi,

498
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:55,586
so you knew you could frame him for it.

499
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:01,801
Why are you suspecting me?
On what grounds?

500
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:05,054
We have evidence that you killed her.

501
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:25,491
Before Jang Ha-bin, Yoon Ji-su,

502
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:29,245
and Choi Yeong-min arrived,
you were at the scene already.

503
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:35,126
The person who killed Lee Su-hyeon
and took the video of her

504
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:38,087
was you.

505
01:02:43,217 --> 01:02:44,510
But you said

506
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:47,972
I shouldn't tell anyone about it.

507
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:54,645
I was so scared to eat my mom's food…

508
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,236
because I thought she might kill me too.

509
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:36,813
What if…

510
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:43,528
I end up like Kim Seong-hui?

511
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,409
Just like I used you to get away…

512
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:55,331
she used her son too.

513
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:57,291
No.

514
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:00,294
You're different.

515
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:04,632
I didn't know anything…

516
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:08,427
but I thought I knew everything.

517
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:12,139
Once people get to know me,

518
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,768
they don't trust me and leave.

519
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:22,108
I don't know who I am.

520
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:29,657
I'll stay with you.

521
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:43,337
Until you figure out

522
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,507
who you are.

523
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:52,346
I'll be by your side.

524
01:05:22,126 --> 01:05:24,003
I have something I must tell Jun-tae.

525
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:29,508
You can tell me.

526
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:32,178
I'll pass it on to him.

527
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:35,973
Mr. Park.

528
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:42,313
This is from your father.

529
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:25,064
It's raining a lot today.

530
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:28,734
I had dried radish greens soup for lunch.

531
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:32,571
I wonder what your favorite food is.

532
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:37,660
You must have started
high school this year.

533
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,205
I'm sorry.

534
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,457
I couldn't even buy you your uniform.

535
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:47,670
I'm so sorry

536
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:50,297
that I'm your father, Jun-tae.

537
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:56,012
I miss you, Jun-tae.

538
01:06:57,304 --> 01:06:59,265
I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T WANT
TO SEE ME

539
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:01,308
BUT I TRULY WANT TO APOLOGIZE

540
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:21,287
I'm so…

541
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:26,584
I'm so sorry, my son.

542
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:47,521
Geez.

543
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:49,648
You deserve your mom's nagging.

544
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,485
Wait. I'll call you back.

545
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:58,365
I heard you turned in
your resignation letter.

546
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:04,914
It's all over now,
so why don't you reconsider?

547
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:10,252
I already made up my mind

548
01:08:11,545 --> 01:08:13,047
when I crossed the line as a cop.

549
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:19,678
I wouldn't have been able to handle it
like you did.

550
01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:22,890
My only focus
would've been my child, not the case.

551
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:26,811
I know you did your best.

552
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:29,897
Good job.

553
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:33,984
Sorry for everything.

554
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:46,205
Officer Lee, you were right.

555
01:08:51,585 --> 01:08:53,504
My naive sympathy kept me

556
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:57,174
from seeing the truth in front of me.

557
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:01,762
I almost ruined everything…

558
01:09:05,766 --> 01:09:07,184
acting like a good person.

559
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:10,521
Both the case and with Do-yun.

560
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:14,483
My disappointment in Captain Jang

561
01:09:16,193 --> 01:09:17,653
also kept me

562
01:09:19,446 --> 01:09:20,865
from believing Ha-bin.

563
01:09:21,448 --> 01:09:23,075
I thought I was being objective…

564
01:09:25,369 --> 01:09:27,037
but I was wrong.

565
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:30,416
Why was it so hard for us
to see things as they were?

566
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:33,961
I know.

567
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:39,133
I'm going to quit.

568
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:42,469
I'm not fit to be a police officer.

569
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:46,599
Maybe a good person is

570
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:50,936
more likely to become
a good police officer.

571
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:55,733
You're doing great.

572
01:10:17,504 --> 01:10:18,547
Captain.

573
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:22,009
We're having a team lunch today.

574
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:25,137
Right. Beef barbecue, right?

575
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,555
Yes. I made a reservation.

576
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:29,600
-It's beef barbecue.
-Why don't you join us?

577
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:33,270
No, I'll pass.

578
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:36,232
My daughter is waiting.

579
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:43,113
He is indeed a doting dad.

580
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,418
But let's

581
01:10:57,878 --> 01:10:59,380
grab a drink another time.

582
01:11:15,854 --> 01:11:18,232
Shall we go for the barbecue now?

583
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:20,317
Are you out of your mind?

584
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:55,811
Go on.

585
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:11,076
Happy birthday.

586
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,018
Why a watch?

587
01:12:44,276 --> 01:12:45,527
No reason.

588
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:01,043
Shall we eat now?

589
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:16,243
WE SINCERELY THANK YOU FOR
YOUR LOVE AND SUPPORT FOR DOUBT

590
01:15:15,135 --> 01:15:20,140
