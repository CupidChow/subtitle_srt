1
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,712
I asked, are you sure
you remember correctly?

2
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,179
Then…

3
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,724
how did Min-a die?

4
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,782
Mr. Park, was there perhaps…

5
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,580
INTERROGATION ROOM

6
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:06,209
From this moment on, Jang Ha-bin is
a suspect in Choi's murder case,

7
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:11,422
and you'll be removed
from the investigation.

8
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,674
Captain Oh.

9
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,760
I can explain.

10
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,139
I can wrap up the interview
with Park now and--

11
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,265
Officer Lee, you go in.

12
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,976
Follow me.

13
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:23,893
Captain Oh.

14
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,312
Park's statement is off.

15
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,278
I understand she can be suspicious.

16
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,864
You can investigate her.

17
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,242
But I can't be removed
from the investigation.

18
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,368
What?

19
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:44,164
Are you saying you still
want to be part of the investigation?

20
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:48,126
My daughter may have done something wrong,
but she didn't kill anyone.

21
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,795
There's a photo of her next to the body.
There's no stronger--

22
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,048
The photo isn't direct evidence.
It's circumstantial.

23
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,300
Instead of looking at the photo,

24
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,844
we should focus on
why this person took it--

25
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,138
Does that even matter right now?

26
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,183
A suspect's father is involved
in the investigation.

27
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,770
This is a serious problem.

28
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,318
Park Jun-tae isn't the culprit.

29
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,033
His confession doesn't align
with the cause of the victim's death.

30
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:27,415
If he's not the culprit, then who is?

31
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,838
Mr. Park and I…

32
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,301
had dinner together…

33
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,056
and went into the room.

34
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:49,312
Then my stomach suddenly started to--

35
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,814
I told you it's not the stomach.
It's a fever.

36
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,944
Do-yun, I'm not mad at you.

37
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:59,030
But you can't make any mistakes.
Try again.

38
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,283
Mr. Park and I…

39
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,287
had dinner together

40
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,249
and went into the room.

41
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,292
Why did you say that you strangled her?

42
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,547
That statement has been confirmed false.

43
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,218
How did you kill her?

44
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,722
I want to check something.

45
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,434
Can I talk to Ha-bin's dad?

46
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,689
You can tell me.

47
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:40,071
Park doesn't have any memories from
the time of the crime for sure.

48
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,447
That's nonsense!

49
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,617
What kind of nut confesses
to something he doesn't remember?

50
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,412
You know that the only way to fix this

51
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,957
is to find the real culprit, Chief.

52
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,295
If you give me one last chance,
I will find the real culprit.

53
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,672
Do you even know
what you're talking about?

54
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:00,925
How could a suspect's father
carry out the investigation?

55
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,844
If my daughter was the murderer,

56
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,098
why would I say Park Jun-tae isn't?

57
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,350
Sir, we don't need to hear this anymore.

58
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,812
We should stick to the rule
and remove him from the investigation.

59
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,150
What's wrong?

60
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,324
Give us the room.

61
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,796
What is it?

62
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,676
Park says he only wants
Captain Jang to interview him.

63
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,181
Sir, we should never let him.

64
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,433
We'll get him to talk.

65
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,143
We've already arrested him.

66
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,353
We can't prosecute him
for a false confession.

67
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,023
But sir, this is not right.

68
00:05:57,106 --> 00:06:00,318
Jang Tae-su can't interview Park Jun-tae.

69
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,756
How did it go?

70
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:27,095
We're going to call in Jang Ha-bin
for an interview.

71
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,850
I'll give you two hours.

72
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,603
If we see you
trying to pull anything funny,

73
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,272
we'll stop the interview.

74
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,664
-Sir, about the photo we've received…
-Yes?

75
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,791
The delivery company just got back to us.

76
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,632
-Call Captain Oh.
-Yes, sir.

77
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:05,842
EXPRESS DELIVERY

78
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,968
Explain this.

79
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:13,266
Jung Du-cheol sent that photo, didn't he?

80
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,146
Did he blackmail you?

81
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:24,986
It's true that he blackmailed me.
But I didn't let it get to me.

82
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,822
Is the reason
why Park only wants to talk with you

83
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:31,409
and why you keep saying Park is innocent
related to that blackmail?

84
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,286
That's not true. The truth is--

85
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,290
You can't interview him.
Go fetch Jang Ha-bin.

86
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:40,001
Captain Oh. Just trust me this time and--

87
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,419
Should I request a warrant?

88
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,548
Fetch your daughter.

89
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,142
-Detective Kim, fetch Jang Ha-bin.
-But Captain Jang said he'd get her--

90
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:59,228
No, you go so they can't
get the stories straight.

91
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,354
Yes, sir.

92
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:06,736
And check her alibi again.

93
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,364
But we already have
a photo of her with the body.

94
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,617
She was involved
in the Song Min-a case as well.

95
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,995
We have to start from square one.

96
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,040
Yes, sir.

97
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,635
We need to investigate you
regarding Choi's murder case.

98
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,303
So get ready and follow us.

99
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,433
It's okay. There's nothing to worry about.

100
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,741
Where's the bag with the evidence?

101
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,661
It's gone.

102
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,122
I burned it.

103
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:10,424
We need more information
on Jang Ha-bin so we can interrogate her.

104
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,010
-Hello. Detective Park speaking.
-I'll look into it.

105
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,178
Captain.

106
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,722
Jung Du-cheol called.

107
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,477
Jang Ha-bin killed Choi Yeong-min.

108
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,729
I saw it with my own eyes.

109
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:28,317
Park Jun-tae already confessed
that he murdered both Choi and Song.

110
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,905
We know that you're the accomplice
in Song's murder case.

111
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,950
-So turn yourself in.
-On the day Song's body was buried,

112
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,828
I saw Jang Ha-bin on Mount Daehwa.

113
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,834
We've already confirmed
her alibi for that day.

114
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,127
I said I saw it.

115
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,671
Because I…

116
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,091
I hit her with my car.

117
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,767
Don't go easy on her because she's
a cop's daughter. Investigate thoroughly.

118
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,439
Were you really with Ha-bin
the entire night then?

119
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,775
I told you last time.

120
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,320
Yes, I was.

121
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,666
Do you see Ha-bin?

122
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,879
The hidden part is the victim's body.

123
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,758
I get you're worried about your friend,

124
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,844
but doing this can put her
in even greater danger.

125
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,556
Is this really helping Ha-bin?

126
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,100
Think about that.

127
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,273
She booked
the party room on the first floor

128
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,442
to sneak out through the terrace at night.

129
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:56,322
So Jung was telling the truth
when he said he saw her at Mount Daehwa.

130
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,745
All right. From this point on, Jang Ha-bin
is a suspect in the Song Min-a case too.

131
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:08,834
When she arrives, pull yourself together
and interrogate her thoroughly. Okay?

132
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,044
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

133
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:21,722
Detective Kim.

134
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,766
Can we have a moment, please?

135
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,434
I can handle the interrogation.

136
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,311
No.

137
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,941
Legally, you're still underage,
and that means I can accompany you.

138
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,693
I can do it by myself.

139
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:39,198
-I know you don't want me to help--
-You want to catch the culprit, right?

140
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,995
The quickest way to prove I didn't kill

141
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,040
is to find the real culprit.

142
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,943
Are you sure you remember correctly?

143
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,244
YEONJU POLICE STATION

144
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,876
Can I talk with Ha-bin's dad for a second?

145
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,711
I'm afraid you can't.

146
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,423
Then can I make one phone call?

147
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,093
There's something I must check.

148
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,839
Park Jun-tae

149
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,343
just admitted
that he killed all the victims.

150
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:09,265
Once we confirm
a few more of his statements,

151
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,183
everything will be over.

152
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,185
Okay.

153
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:17,022
According to Park,
he ran away with Song's body

154
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,734
before you came home
from the hospital that night.

155
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:26,740
Did you ever see Song that day?

156
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,535
No, I didn't.

157
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,581
-Not even once?
-No.

158
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,877
I took my son
to the hospital that day and…

159
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,928
He had a high fever.

160
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,764
So I took him to the emergency room.

161
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,479
All your statements align with Park's.

162
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,650
Thank you.

163
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,954
Can I interview Do-yun
since I'm here already?

164
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,459
Why would you interview him?

165
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,419
He's part of the case too.

166
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:25,466
If I interview him at the station,
he'll get nervous

167
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,760
and it'll take longer.

168
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,653
Do you know why you're being interviewed?

169
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,155
I was told it was about
Choi's murder case.

170
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,242
Why did you say
you didn't know Choi last time?

171
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,630
I'm going to need you to explain this.

172
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,844
I abducted Choi Yeong-min.

173
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,557
I stabbed him in the knee too.

174
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,437
But…

175
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,106
I didn't kill him.

176
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,817
I heard there was evidence.

177
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,944
Why did you get rid of it?

178
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,240
If you really hadn't killed him,

179
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,076
that evidence might have
proved your innocence.

180
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,705
I thought my dad would tell me to confess,

181
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,623
so I got rid of it.

182
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,795
Is there something else
that can prove your innocence?

183
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:35,429
Proving the suspect's guilt or innocence
is the cops' job, not mine.

184
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,892
Everything I told you is true.

185
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,770
Geez, she really is something.

186
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,566
On the day Song died…

187
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,320
you were at Mount Daehwa, right?

188
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,745
Jung Du-cheol dismembered
Song's body, right?

189
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,417
I couldn't really see his face then,

190
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:10,380
but he had the phone that I lost.

191
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,134
-Are you saying you're just a witness?
-Yes.

192
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,977
After getting injured
at the mountain that day,

193
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,230
you deliberately ran into a car
the next day.

194
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,691
Yes.

195
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:34,363
Why did you make up an alibi
if you're just a witness?

196
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:40,744
Because I knew I'd be suspected like this.

197
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:46,875
No.

198
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:53,632
Even before Song died,
you made up an alibi with your friend.

199
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:57,928
From the beginning…

200
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,391
you intended to kill Song, didn't you?

201
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,905
You must be Do-yun.

202
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,164
Do-yun.

203
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:30,377
Do you remember the night
you got sick and went to the ER?

204
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,382
Do you remember
what you did with Mr. Park that day?

205
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,467
We watched television…

206
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,972
and then had dinner together.

207
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:49,104
Min-a told you
that she liked Mr. Park a lot, right?

208
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,523
She said she liked him…

209
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,444
because he's handsome.

210
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,702
Can I have some water, please?

211
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,331
Sure.

212
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,712
Do-yun.

213
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:20,344
I heard that Mr. Park did
something bad to Min-a that day.

214
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,059
Did the two have a fight perhaps?

215
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,694
How did she look that day?

216
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,407
She just looked

217
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,202
the same as usual.

218
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,332
The same as usual?

219
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:53,794
Yes.

220
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,061
Do-yun saw Min-a that day.

221
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,941
You said you never saw her that day.

222
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:52,144
She's saying she didn't kill anyone
and only injured Choi.

223
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,520
That can't be true.

224
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,942
She most likely approached
Song and Choi to murder them.

225
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,819
The biggest problem now is

226
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,239
that she's keeping quiet about her motive.

227
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,330
What are you doing here?

228
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,622
Get out.

229
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,124
Captain Jang. Get out, now.

230
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,334
-Captain Oh.
-You can't--

231
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,668
Kim Seong-hui lied.

232
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,463
I warned you. If you keep acting like…

233
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,884
She just looked the same as usual.

234
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,720
The same as usual?

235
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:28,680
Yes.

236
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:34,644
Kim Seong-hui met Song Min-a
on the day of the incident.

237
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:38,815
Have you lost your mind?
Who do you think you are to interview him?

238
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:43,862
Before Park came to Kim's home,
Song had already been murdered.

239
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:47,574
And Kim convinced Park,
who was drunk at that time,

240
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,076
that he did it.

241
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,496
But why would Kim kill Song?

242
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:53,997
What was her motive?

243
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:58,585
Thanks, Ms. Kim,
for always giving me food.

244
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,880
It's not a big deal.

245
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,928
Is everything okay?

246
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:15,644
I think the police are suspicious of me.

247
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,521
Of you? Why?

248
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:20,357
They're investigating Mr. Park now.

249
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,693
So naturally they're suspecting me too.

250
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,405
I'm sorry.

251
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:32,536
I shouldn't have said you're dating him.

252
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:38,458
It's okay, Eun-jin. It's not your fault.

253
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:48,760
Actually, Eun-jin.

254
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,806
I know something,

255
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,143
but I don't think they will
believe me if I say it.

256
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,353
I can help.

257
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,647
I want to help.

258
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,859
Can you do that for me?

259
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,507
Do-yun!

260
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,426
Why did you do that to Eun-jin?

261
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,219
Are you okay?

262
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,639
I'm okay.

263
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,601
Go on inside. I'll take care of this.

264
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,645
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

265
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:45,734
Why did you do that?

266
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,238
I'm sorry, Mom.

267
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:53,825
Do-yun, what's wrong?

268
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,286
Tell me. Why did you do that?

269
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:06,630
Her primary motive was money.

270
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:10,217
When Song ran away from the gang,
she stole Choi's money.

271
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,178
Choi also carried money
while he was on the run.

272
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,349
But nothing was found at the crime scene.

273
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:19,851
Captain Jang.

274
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,562
There's a limit to my patience.

275
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:26,942
If I ever catch you snooping around
behind our backs like this,

276
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,319
I will not let it slide.

277
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,794
Go get Kim Seong-hui and Kwon Do-yun.

278
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:46,836
Yes, sir.

279
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,257
About the Song Min-a case…

280
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,969
You knew Ha-bin's alibi
was made up, right?

281
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,724
Why did Ha-bin approach Song and Choi?

282
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,230
You're still hiding something.

283
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:16,157
My daughter didn't kill anyone.

284
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,997
Aren't you ashamed as a police officer?

285
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,544
I looked up to you, Captain.

286
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,923
And I wish I didn't.

287
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,097
Come on. Let's go.

288
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:51,860
What's happening?

289
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,654
She's refusing to say anything.

290
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,575
Go and check Do-yun's statements again.

291
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,203
I will interview Do-yun.

292
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,646
Do-yun.

293
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,732
You're just here…

294
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,194
to have a chat with me.

295
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,743
Did you really see Min-a that day?

296
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:45,872
I got confused.

297
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,250
It wasn't that day.

298
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,421
Then when was the last time you saw her?

299
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:57,384
I can't remember.

300
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,356
You did well.

301
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,861
Just like you did now,
tell me whatever you remember.

302
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,154
You did a great job.

303
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:25,161
Have you ever talked about
what happened that day with your mom?

304
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,417
Never?

305
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,088
You're doing a great job.

306
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,306
I don't want…

307
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,727
to tell you.

308
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,564
Why not?

309
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:56,860
No reason.

310
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,156
Is it because it's hard to lie?

311
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:05,785
Do-yun.

312
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,538
It's okay. I can wait

313
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,916
for as long as you need

314
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,794
to tell me the truth, Do-yun.

315
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,056
I did that because…

316
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,230
Because I liked her.

317
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,695
Eun-jin.

318
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,908
Mom asked me to pick up the containers.

319
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:47,243
Okay. Give me one second.

320
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,156
Do you want to know what it is?

321
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:28,868
Is it candy?

322
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,625
It's a candy that makes you feel good.

323
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,801
Hey.

324
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,888
You still haven't found Song Min-a?

325
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,728
I'm going to kill this fucking bitch
once I catch her.

326
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:35,894
Where's Ms. Kim?

327
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,062
She went to the dry cleaner's.

328
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,610
I'm freaking tired.

329
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:48,656
Hey, don't tell Choi Yeong-min
that I was here, okay?

330
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,453
Get me something to drink.

331
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,779
Gosh, this is frustrating.

332
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:33,201
It's a candy that makes you feel good.

333
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,196
He said…

334
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,036
the candy makes you feel good.

335
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:24,210
I just wanted to make her feel better.

336
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,443
You knew everything, didn't you?

337
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,654
He's just a kid.

338
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,490
I don't know what he said,

339
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,826
but it's not true.

340
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,957
Do-yun won't face criminal punishment
due to his young age.

341
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,462
So please be honest with me.

342
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,970
It's all my fault.

343
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:21,225
I should've kicked out the runaway kids.

344
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,482
I just felt too bad for them to do that.

345
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,824
Seeing Yeong-min beat the kids

346
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,495
made Do-yun a little insecure.

347
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,957
That's probably
why he said those strange things.

348
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,212
Anyway, it was the kid
who killed Song Min-a.

349
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:52,715
It was an accident.

350
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:56,761
If Kim tried to cover it up,
she'd have to face the consequences.

351
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:59,013
But covering for your son

352
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,724
isn't subject to criminal punishment.

353
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,976
The problem is
that the body was disposed of.

354
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,730
She can still be punished
for aiding and abetting in the disposal

355
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:11,567
and Park might even file a civil suit.

356
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,361
Geez.

357
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,403
I should get going.

358
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:15,780
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

359
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:19,909
This means that what Jang Ha-bin said
was true. She only injured him.

360
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:23,579
Send her home for now.

361
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,456
Yes, sir.

362
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,337
I still don't get it.

363
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,383
She ran from the murder scene

364
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,928
and Captain Jang hid the fact
that he got blackmailed.

365
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:42,682
All of this can't just be to cover up
a simple assault.

366
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,475
And?

367
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,602
Lee Su-hyeon's case hasn't been solved.

368
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,816
And she still hasn't told us
why she approached Song and Choi.

369
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,442
Officer Lee.

370
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,821
Let's not jump to conclusions.

371
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:02,201
We suspected her of killing Song,
and it turned out she didn't.

372
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,180
I'm hungry.

373
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,249
Do-yun.

374
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,631
Do-yun, are you okay?

375
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:14,982
Do-yun.

376
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:18,986
Does your mom know

377
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,447
what happened that day?

378
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,577
Mom told me…

379
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,120
Yes?

380
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:35,044
…not to tell anyone about it.

381
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,014
About that…

382
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,641
Look at me, Do-yun.

383
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,312
Don't tell anyone about it.

384
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,239
There will be a few more interviews.

385
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,284
We'll call you.

386
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,786
Bye, Do-yun.

387
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:09,704
Bye.

388
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,545
Thank you.

389
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,131
Ms. Kim.

390
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:28,764
I'll be back in a second.

391
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:33,811
Yes?

392
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:39,025
If I were you,
I would never admit that I knew.

393
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:47,325
Do-yun needs you right now.

394
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,659
Please remember that.

395
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,582
Thank you, Detective.

396
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,275
Gosh, this is killing me.

397
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,236
Detective Kim.

398
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:25,738
Yes.

399
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,867
Why the long face?

400
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,204
This case seems impossible to solve.

401
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:34,705
Geez.

402
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,458
-You got them?
-Yes.

403
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,085
Have some pizza.

404
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,049
Pizza is the best late-night snack.

405
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,551
It's tasty.

406
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,137
It's a famous pizza place
that just opened nearby.

407
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:52,973
-It's good.
-Officer Lee.

408
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,726
You should have some too.
You didn't have dinner.

409
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,186
I'll have it later.

410
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:03,692
Excuse me.

411
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,694
Eun-jin.

412
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:08,739
What brings you here?

413
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,659
I have something to show you.

414
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,914
Here.

415
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,129
What do you want to eat?

416
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,299
Let's just go anywhere.

417
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:04,503
What?

418
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,480
When Choi was alive,

419
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,525
Eun-jin was too afraid to show us this.

420
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,278
So…

421
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:14,031
Yoon Ji-su killed Lee Su-hyeon,

422
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,992
and Choi Yeong-min knew about it.

423
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:17,993
Yes.

424
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,998
This must be related to the reason
why Ha-bin approached the runaway kids.

425
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:27,253
I wonder
why Yoon Ji-su killed Lee Su-hyeon.

426
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,642
Don't give them any statements.

427
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,563
I heard they got the video of Mom.

428
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,816
Explaining that it was
your mom's misunderstanding will only

429
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,859
make them suspicious of you. So don't--

430
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,236
I'll do the interview.

431
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,783
I didn't kill anyone.

432
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:01,745
Ha-bin.

433
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,915
Just listen to me this one time.

434
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:10,379
Until your innocence is proven…

435
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,341
please just do as I say.

436
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:38,115
Let's skip the unnecessary procedures
and get to the point.

437
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:40,743
What's that video?

438
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,496
Did Yoon Ji-su…

439
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,875
kill Lee Su-hyeon?

440
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:51,295
Did Kim Seong-hui

441
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,673
confess that she killed Song Min-a?

442
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,925
It was not Kim Seong-hui.
Kwon Do-yun killed her.

443
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,682
That's what she said?

444
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,018
We got her confession and evidence.

445
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:08,729
-But that's not important now--
-Captain!

446
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:12,566
We've got footage of Jung Du-cheol
in front of the station.

447
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:14,193
Where is he now?

448
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:17,279
We're looking into that now.
You should come and see.

449
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,075
Damn it.

450
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:56,360
NO ENTRY

451
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,158
Hi, Do-yun. What's up?

452
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:07,871
Who are you?

453
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,123
Mr. Jung.

454
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,669
This is where Choi Yeong-min died.

455
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,430
Mr. Jung.

456
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,245
You set him up with all of this.

457
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,874
Tell me the truth.

458
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:53,667
I didn't.

459
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,378
There must be a misunderstanding.
Please calm--

460
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:57,713
-Tell me!
-I didn't.

461
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,256
Tell me the truth!

462
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,966
Mr. Jung!

463
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:17,274
Split into two groups. Team Two go
to the right and Team One go to the left.

464
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:18,692
What was that?

465
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:31,914
Sir, are you okay?

466
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:33,415
-What the…
-Get him!

467
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:45,594
Get him!

468
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,551
-He's not there?
-No.

469
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:29,680
-Did you find anything?
-No.

470
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:31,765
We can't seem to locate Jung anymore.

471
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:34,476
Kim Seong-hui is gone too.
She won't answer her phone.

472
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,604
What was Kim doing here?

473
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,315
What if

474
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,360
Captain Jang was actually right?

475
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:45,571
Maybe she came to get Choi's money.

476
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,081
Excuse me.

477
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:58,792
I have something to share.

478
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:03,046
Can I talk with Officer Gu?

479
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:12,180
This is Yeong-min's bag.

480
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:16,018
How did you get this?

481
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:20,439
I knew about Yeong-min's other hideout.

482
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,317
I went to see if there was anything,

483
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:26,945
and I found this bag.
I thought this would help.

484
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:28,739
Did you know…

485
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:35,829
about the video
that Eun-jin showed us too?

486
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:37,998
I asked her to show you
to avoid suspicion.

487
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,253
I wasn't sure
if I should bring this bag too, actually.

488
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,591
But I thought you would believe me.

489
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:53,805
I see.

490
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,694
Kim Seong-hui brought Choi's belongings?

491
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,029
Where's she now?

492
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:11,698
I think you should see this first.

493
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,285
-What's this?
-It's Choi's cell phone.

494
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,705
I SAW YOUR DAUGHTER
KILL LEE SU-HYEON

495
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,375
BRING ME THE MONEY
BEFORE I CALL THE POLICE

496
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,378
I HAVE A VIDEO OF YOU
BURYING HER

497
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,133
Request an arrest warrant

498
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:33,220
for Jang Ha-bin
on suspicion of murdering Lee.

499
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,346
Yes, sir.

500
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:24,855
Turn yourself in.

501
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:29,234
Park Jun-tae is trying
to protect Kim Seong-hui.

502
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:32,821
Choi might not have been killed by him.

503
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:38,118
You're the only one
who can change his mind now.

504
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,170
I don't…

505
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:50,672
believe you.

506
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:56,636
Mr. Jung.

507
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,974
I need to prove
that Kim Seong-hui is the culprit

508
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:04,186
to prove my daughter's innocence.

509
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:12,235
I'm here to turn myself in.

510
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:16,656
Before I tell you everything…

511
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:22,287
let me see my son first.

512
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:36,134
Did you catch the culprit?

513
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:40,764
Just wait.

514
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:57,864
Have a one-on-one interrogation
with Jung Du-cheol.

515
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,492
And tell him
we'll let him meet Park if he cooperates.

516
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:01,451
Yes, sir.

517
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,871
-Officer Gu, conduct the interrogation.
-Yes, sir.

518
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,541
And Officer Lee, investigate thoroughly

519
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,417
and get Jang Ha-bin's confession.

520
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:10,544
Yes, sir.

521
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,842
If the interrogations go well,
we might find something.

522
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:19,386
Captain.

523
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:23,807
Looks like Lee Su-hyeon was
definitely killed by Jang Ha-bin.

524
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:28,520
There were two phone numbers registered
under Yoon, so I looked into it and…

525
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:30,981
Look here.

526
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:36,653
LEE SU-HYEON'S NUMBER
JANG HA-BIN'S NUMBER

527
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:39,781

She's been digging into us too.

546
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:42,177
She even knew we were going to be…

547
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:44,971

-Yes.

551
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:13,583
Bring her in first.

552
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:26,763
Did you let Jung meet Park?

553
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:32,560
We need to use Jung
to get more statements from Park.

554
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:38,483
Ha-bin killed Lee Su-hyeon, right?

555
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:42,946
No.

556
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:46,366
We found the text messages
where Choi was blackmailing Yoon.

557
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,451
She thought Ha-bin killed her.

558
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,621
She was fooled.

559
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,039
You must've felt guilty.

560
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,291
When you lost your son…

561
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:58,795
you had the same suspicion.

562
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:14,269
So what?

563
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:18,898

CAN'T FORGET DAD YELLING
AT MOM TO DIE

573
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:16,372
She knew you would suspect her
and feel bad about it,

574
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,876
but also would eventually trust her.

575
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,962
Including what's happening now,

576
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:26,132
Ha-bin predicted everything.

577
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,384
IF THE TRUTH COMES OUT

578
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:29,886
For the perfect murder…

579
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:31,471
HE WOULDN'T HESITATE TO SAVE ME

580
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:34,516
…she studied the people involved
to use them to her advantage.

581
00:56:58,790 --> 00:56:59,833
So what?

582
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:03,169
What about this?

583
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:09,425
Her mom committed suicide
due to blackmail.

584
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:14,430
Of course she wants to take revenge.

585
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:15,640
Lee Su-hyeon…

586
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,061
was killed by Jang Ha-bin.

587
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:23,898
No. Ha-bin didn't even know she died.

588
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,443
Here's the record from the day Lee died.

589
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:27,944
This base station received signals

590
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:32,532
from Jang Ha-bin, Yoon Ji-su, and
Lee Su-hyeon's phones at the same time.

591
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:35,285
On the night Lee died,
the three of them were together.

592
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:37,704
What if this wasn't about
taking revenge for her mom,

593
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,831
but was about killing people
who know about her crime

594
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:41,374
so she can conceal it?

595
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:45,920
Captain Jang,
you're now helping her with her plan.

596
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,007
Do you still not get it?

597
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:45,772
HOTEL

598
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:57,200
Do you have a room available?

599
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:28,356
I'd like to extend my stay for a week.

600
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:30,316
You don't need to clean the room.

601
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,252
Sure you don't want to eat anything?

602
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:52,213
Yes, I'm not hungry.

603
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:01,514
Mom.

604
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:03,600
Yes?

605
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:05,977
Why do I keep forgetting…

606
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:11,774
every time I do something bad?

607
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:17,739
Because you have to protect yourself.

608
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,575
That's why you forget it.

609
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:40,011
And I don't think those are bad things.

610
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:47,018
Whatever makes you and me happy
is a good thing.

611
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:54,901
I can do anything for you, Do-yun.

612
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:56,903
You know that, right?

613
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:00,365
Me too.

614
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:39,362
Choi Yeong-min, that scumbag,

615
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:43,408
blackmailed some lady
and she ended up killing herself.

616
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:48,746
Her daughter came to me.

617
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:52,917
Just like what you said
on the phone earlier,

618
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,962
I have no idea what you're talking about.

619
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:02,009
You don't have to act in front of me.

620
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:05,972
I know the relationship
between you and Choi Yeong-min.

621
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:11,519
He didn't blackmail her alone, right?

622
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,772
No way an idiot like him
came up with the idea.

623
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:19,110
I don't understand
what you're trying to say.

624
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,239
I want one-third of the share.

625
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,158
So it's fair.

626
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:30,872
I've been doing
all the dangerous deliveries.

627
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:32,832
If you give me the share…

628
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:36,586
I won't report you to the police.

629
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:42,383
I'll bring the money.

630
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,429
Wait here, Min-a.

631
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,116
This is delicious.

632
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,326
Thanks for the food.

633
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,453
This is so tasty.

634
01:05:57,536 --> 01:05:59,747
-Try this.
-I can't wait.

635
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:02,124
-My gosh. It's so good.
-You said you're on a diet.

636
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:04,710
-No, I don't want that.
-Eat these first.

637
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,295
-No.
-Take the sausage.

638
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:07,463
You have to eat these.

639
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:10,091
This is so good!
I need to lose weight, though.

640
01:06:10,174 --> 01:06:12,218
-Delicious.
-Then you should eat this.

641
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:17,348
Here's fried chicken, your favorite.

642
01:06:18,015 --> 01:06:19,016
It looks so good!

643
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,518
-Awesome.
-It's tasty.

644
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:21,519
The food is great.

645
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:22,603
Do you like the food?

646
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:24,105
-I'll try.
-Good.

647
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:06,707
Su-hyeon? Where are you now?

648
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:09,668
There's no record of you
calling her since that day,

649
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:13,506
as if you knew that she was dead.

650
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:16,801
Is there any proof that I killed her?

651
01:08:17,384 --> 01:08:20,846
Su-hyeon wanted me to bring you to her
because she misses you.

652
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:23,224
I can't stop here.

653
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,727
You know what kind of person I am.

654
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:28,479
But you must convince her to confess.

655
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:32,274
Do you want to know how I killed Su-hyeon?

656
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:33,859
I believe you.

657
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,821
I will prove your innocence…

658
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:40,950
and catch the real culprit.
