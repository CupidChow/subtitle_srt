1
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,712
Because you know…

2
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:50,175
that I will find
and kill the culprit at all costs…

3
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,886
if you fail to find them first.

4
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,474
Remember who killed your mom?

5
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,393
She took her own life.

6
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:07,067
So who are you taking revenge for?

7
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,277
Do you really think it was suicide?

8
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,782
They killed Lee Su-hyeon
and made her believe I did it.

9
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,243
Then they threatened to call the police
to extort money from her.

10
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,038
-How is that--
-And that's why she committed suicide.

11
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,668
What if your mom hadn't believed…

12
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,713
that you killed Lee Su-hyeon?

13
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,885
I know you hate your mom…

14
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,555
for thinking you're a murderer

15
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,557
and then taking her own life.

16
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,060
You can't forgive her.

17
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,146
You're right.

18
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,527
Still, I'm going to find them

19
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,238
and kill them.

20
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,491
Do you really think…

21
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:02,997
your mom committed suicide
because of this culprit?

22
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,265
It was because of you.

23
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:25,436
Imagine what she had to go through
every time she saw you.

24
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,773
Thinking about how she buried the body

25
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,067
must have been painful to her.

26
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,737
Stop avoiding reality and face it.

27
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,365
You can't handle the truth.

28
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,743
That's why you want to kill someone.

29
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,462
Jang Ha-bin.

30
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,842
Mom did what she did…

31
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,264
not because of anyone else,

32
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,517
but because of her own doubts.

33
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,660
We detected Choi's DNA

34
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,746
from the knife you've submitted.

35
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,499
Could you tell us

36
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:55,753
what happened on the day
you committed the crime?

37
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,131
When I got there after the phone call,

38
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,509
Choi Yeong-min was out of his mind.

39
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:07,432
If I hadn't gone there then,
Seong-hui would've gotten hurt.

40
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,769
After dropping off Seong-hui,

41
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,273
I went back to Choi Yeong-min.

42
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:20,653
I was pretty angry,
but I didn't mean to kill him.

43
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,031
Are you saying it was impulsive?

44
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:25,616
Yes.

45
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,956
But the crime scene
we've investigated suggests otherwise.

46
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,046
We found signs that it was premeditated.

47
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,924
There's also a possibility
that it was done by more than one person.

48
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,260
Are you sure

49
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,096
you were alone at the scene?

50
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,355
Mr. Park Jun-tae.

51
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,860
Let's take a short break here.

52
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,905
What are you doing?

53
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,740
I'll interview him.

54
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,701
Still, you can't just stop
the interrogation like that.

55
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:16,584
Let's continue this interview in a bit.

56
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,669
There was someone else
at the scene, right?

57
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,383
Captain Jang.

58
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:25,927
No.

59
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,431
I did all that by myself.

60
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,643
How's Kim Seong-hui doing?

61
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,186
She keeps refusing to speak.

62
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,522
She's trying to protect Park.

63
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:41,859
Anyway, this all started
because Choi kidnapped Kim.

64
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,444
But here's the problem.

65
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,279
Based on the evidence at the scene,

66
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,698
it's hard to say
it was done solely by Park.

67
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,159
Are you saying he killed him with Kim?

68
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,911
We'll need to dig deeper.

69
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,872
I'll ask more
about the situation at that time.

70
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,958
Resume the interview and see if he lied--

71
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,501
I'll do it.

72
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,669
Captain.

73
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,381
-That's it. I can't--
-I'll go.

74
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,674
Captain.

75
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,468
I want to continue the interview.

76
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,804
So you can show him
the picture of the scene again?

77
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,390
Park's statements
didn't align with the evidence.

78
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:16,436
You should've verified it another way
instead of sharing our case information.

79
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,187
Park Jun-tae is lying.

80
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,648
You know that too.

81
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:27,530
Do you think he was with
Kim Seong-hui at the scene?

82
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,285
I think it might not be her.

83
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,100
MY DAUGHTER

84
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:07,695
Sir.

85
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,536
MY DAUGHTER

86
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,019
Release Park Jun-tae.

87
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,232
Or your daughter's life is over.

88
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,403
I'll give you one day.

89
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:30,736
MOM

90
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:49,171
SENDER: JUNG DU-CHEOL

91
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:53,175
RECIPIENT: PARK JUN-TAE

92
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,434
How did you manage to incapacitate Choi?

93
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,103
We had a little scuffle.

94
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,646
And?

95
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,649
And…

96
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,612
Well, I can't remember.

97
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,994
Did you perhaps
strangle him from the back?

98
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,747
Yes.

99
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,166
As I kept my grip,

100
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,211
I could feel his body giving in.

101
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,924
You don't seem familiar
with the crime scene.

102
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,971
We found ligature marks
on his arms and legs.

103
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,724
And his neck and knee
were attacked by two different weapons.

104
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:48,814
You said it was a crime of passion,
but the evidence says otherwise.

105
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,984
When did you prepare the weapons?

106
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,613
Kim couldn't have done it,
because she was kidnapped.

107
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,918
These people were
at the scene that day, right?

108
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,936
He reacted when he saw
the photo of the motorcycle.

109
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,021
So it was not Kim Seong-hui,

110
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,898
but the bikers that were involved.

111
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:34,026
The necklace might belong
to the woman riding in the back.

112
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,612
Well, I suppose.

113
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:39,073
The DNA didn't match Kim's, right?

114
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,283
-No.
-Did you look into the necklace?

115
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,703
Yes. Detective Cho
is trying to track the buyer.

116
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,540
What's the progress
on the motorcycle's route?

117
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,293
We've reviewed
almost all the CCTV footage we got.

118
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,006
Release Park Jun-tae.

119
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,136
Or your daughter's life is over.

120
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,435
-Officer Gu.
-Yes?

121
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,396
Could you bring me all the files
on people around Park?

122
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,355
Yes, sir.

123
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,570
What about Mr. Park?

124
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,738
Is he still absent?

125
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:20,656
Yes.

126
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,450
Are you feeling unwell?

127
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,411
You don't sound so good.

128
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,996
Let me know when he comes back.

129
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,873
I heard the cops were here earlier.

130
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,250
They took everything from his desk.

131
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,298
-Detective.
-Yes?

132
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,592
When can I go home?

133
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,469
I'm worried about my kid.

134
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,388
A social worker is taking care of him,
so you don't need to worry.

135
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,273
Hi, Do-yun.

136
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,694
Have you eaten yet?

137
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,240
I'm coming back soon. Don't worry.

138
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,826
Be nice to the social worker.

139
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,959
Is Do-yun doing all right?

140
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,545
Yes.

141
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,883
Thank you. I was so worried about him.

142
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:21,967
No worries.

143
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:28,807
Ms. Kim.

144
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,560
Let me know if you need anything.

145
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,188
I want to help in any way I can.

146
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,565
Thank you.

147
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,986
Don't worry too much about Do-yun.
He's a strong kid.

148
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:23,696
Hello.

149
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,073
I'm here to see my dad.

150
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,660
You must be Ha-bin.

151
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,933
Park Jun-tae is
under investigation, right?

152
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,860
Someone used your photo to blackmail me.

153
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,446
It's the biker.

154
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,575
Isn't it?

155
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:15,372
I'll tell you who it is if you tell me
how the investigation is going.

156
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,666
Don't you get it?

157
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,836
The situation is very serious right now.

158
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,882
We're tracking the motorcycle.

159
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,676
If the police catch them first
and find this photo--

160
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,429
I'll get arrested and you'll be
kicked off the investigation.

161
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,058
This is why I suggest…

162
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,019
we share what we know.

163
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,775
You changed my mind.

164
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:44,818
What?

165
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,612
My mom…

166
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,865
died because of me.

167
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,368
It wasn't because of you but--

168
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,703
I was going to make
this murder a perfect crime…

169
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,665
but I changed my mind.

170
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,251
I don't care if I get caught.

171
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,893
Ha-bin.

172
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,484
Can we have a quick chat?

173
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,452
You're sweating a lot.

174
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,872
Do you want to order something cold?

175
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,457
I'm okay.

176
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,882
What is it that you wanted to say?

177
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,972
I heard that you were close
with Su-hyeon last year.

178
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,183
Did Mr. Park say that?

179
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,353
How did you know?

180
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,023
It could've been your dad.

181
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,192
My dad doesn't know my friends.

182
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,449
By the way, about Mr. Park…

183
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,242
Is it true?

184
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,539
It's just hard to believe.

185
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,043
Dad told me briefly about it.

186
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,008
I can't share any information
about the investigation.

187
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,259
You understand, right?

188
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,053
Yes.

189
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,472
Did you perhaps hear…

190
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,895
about how Su-hyeon met Choi Yeong-min
after running away from home?

191
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,524
Who's Choi Yeong-min?

192
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,162
I have to go to cram school.

193
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,372
Thanks for your time.

194
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,500
Goodbye then.

195
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,302
Are you okay?

196
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,720
-Yes.
-Are you okay?

197
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,138
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

198
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,223
I'm sorry.

199
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,671
-Hey, wake up.
-Are you okay?

200
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:51,755
-What?
-Hey.

201
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,175
We've identified the biker.
His name is Jung Du-cheol.

202
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,719
He was imprisoned for assault
and released last year.

203
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:01,890
Jung Du-cheol?
Any connection to Park Jun-tae?

204
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,225
On paper, there's nothing,

205
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,562
but according to the agency owner,
he just showed up and rented a truck.

206
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,814
And that was right after
Park made his confession.

207
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,065
Why did he rent the truck?

208
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,568
Apparently, some workers there do that
for their part-time gigs.

209
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,654
Request Jung Du-cheol's live location
and track the truck's route.

210
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:16,780
Yes, sir.

211
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,035
I'll interview Park Jun-tae.

212
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,373
Officer Lee is doing fine.
Why don't we let her do it?

213
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,624
No, we don't have time.

214
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:33,046
Do you have a better idea?

215
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,718
Why are you lying?

216
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,094
What do you mean, I'm lying?

217
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,056
Are you lying
because you want to protect someone?

218
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,813
Why are you trying
to take the blame for something

219
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:50,814
you didn't even do?

220
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,112
Is it because of Kim Seong-hui?

221
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:01,992
Or…

222
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:05,913
Jung Du-cheol?

223
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,689
What's your relationship
with Jung Du-cheol?

224
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,733
I don't know that person.

225
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,485
I see.

226
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:41,406
Then let's talk about Kim Seong-hui first,
who you know well.

227
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:50,249
On the day Choi died, did you really
drop her off when you said you did?

228
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,210
How many times do I have to repeat myself?

229
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,836
I already said I killed him.

230
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,838
What more do you want me to…

231
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,388
Ms. Kim, have a seat.

232
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,391
What are you doing?

233
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,226
Is this how you conduct investigations?

234
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,353
I refuse to cooperate.

235
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,855
Ms. Kim.

236
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,732
On the day Choi died,

237
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,568
where did you go after he dropped you off?

238
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,199
You went back to Choi Yeong-min, right?

239
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,954
As if the repeated beatings
weren't enough,

240
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:32,541
it must've been humiliating to show
such vulnerability in front of him.

241
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,002
Then you saw a knife on the ground

242
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:39,172
and thought you could finally end it all
if you just killed him with it.

243
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,757
Is that why you killed Choi?

244
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,943
Ms. Kim, do you hear me?

245
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,116
Did you kill Choi Yeong-min?

246
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,284
I said I killed him!

247
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,411
I did it.

248
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:00,295
I see. Now, I get it.

249
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,091
Because of Ms. Kim--

250
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,009
Choi Yeong-min, that bastard, found out…

251
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,766
that I killed Song Min-a.

252
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,937
That's why I killed him.

253
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,571
Now he's saying he killed Song Min-a.

254
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,866
Is that a reliable statement?

255
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,119
He might be just lying to get away.

256
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:36,498
-But--
-There's a way to confirm if it's true.

257
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,127
If Park really killed Song Min-a,

258
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:45,382
he must know where her body is.

259
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,453
Hello.

260
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,949
-Oh, no.
-You should've been careful.

261
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,285
-I know.
-It's not a big deal.

262
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,246
I'm okay, Mom.

263
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,790
-You must've been scared.
-I'm okay.

264
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,125
How's the wound?

265
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,294
ADMISSION AND BILLING

266
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:05,921
Your bill has been settled.

267
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:07,923
What?

268
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,927
Your dad transferred the money,
saying he's too busy to come in person.

269
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,522
How could he just send the money
when his daughter passed out?

270
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,483
I know, right?

271
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,295
I don't think he knows.

272
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,027
It's over there.

273
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:59,511
Hey, there! What are you doing?

274
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:14,901
My goodness.

275
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,894
-Captain Oh.
-Yes.

276
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,813
Looks like
there was indeed a corpse there.

277
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,399
Looking at the dirt,
I think it's been dug out recently.

278
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:56,985
-Thank you.
-Sure.

279
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,653
-I'll head back now.
-Okay.

280
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,867
It means someone took the body.

281
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,077
The truck.

282
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:11,124
Jung Du-cheol rented a truck
when Park turned himself in, right?

283
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,752
I'll see if we can figure out
the truck's route.

284
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,552
Release Park Jun-tae.

285
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,638
Or your daughter's life is over.

286
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,018
I'll give you a day.

287
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,781
She left two hours ago
after the treatment.

288
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:44,949
What?

289
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:49,954
TAE-SU

290
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,181
I heard you went to the hospital.

291
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,942
About your mom…

292
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,237
I know who did it to her.

293
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:39,921
Tell me.

294
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,346
Did you take the medication?

295
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,773
Does that make you feel better?

296
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,112
Do you really even know something?

297
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,344
Ha-bin…

298
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,058
Ha-bin…

299
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:21,481
I think Ha-bin killed a dog.

300
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,783
I buried the dog myself,

301
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,328
and I felt so bad.

302
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,246
DECEMBER 6, 2023

303
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,624
It doesn't matter what happens to me.

304
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,668
But…

305
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,088
if Ha-bin does…

306
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,549
something like this again--

307
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:26,421
She knows how her dad…

308
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,300
thinks of her.

309
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:36,639
I didn't want
to become suspicious like him.

310
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,725
AUGUST 3, 2016

311
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,685
That's why I divorced him.

312
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,980
I'm still scared…

313
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:50,486
he might hurt Ha-bin like that again.

314
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:02,206
Ha-bin may be
a bit different from other kids…

315
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,753
but she would never harm her brother.

316
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:13,551
I want Ha-bin
to live a normal life like others.

317
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:17,972
My daughter.

318
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,955
-Captain.
-Yes?

319
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,792
The truck was filmed
on the road connected to the hill.

320
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,418
Jung Du-cheol did take the body.

321
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,837
-Ask the control room to locate the truck.
-Got it.

322
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,715
Now, we know
that Jung was Park's accomplice.

323
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:56,177
How do you think the two are connected?

324
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,264
They have a big age gap,
and lived very different lives

325
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,891
based on their records.

326
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:03,726
You're right.

327
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,813
A criminal and a teacher
don't have much in common.

328
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,525
Hang on a second.

329
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:19,117
Yes, Captain.
Jung Du-cheol is Park Jun-tae's dad.

330
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:20,827
Are you sure?

331
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:24,247
Yes, the prison guard remembers him.

332
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:28,084
Apparently, all the letters Jung sent
to his son in prison were returned.

333
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,502
I've confirmed the records.

334
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,712
I've got to do this.

335
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:19,880
I have to…

336
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,846
I've got to do this.

337
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,102
I have to do this.

338
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:17,438
Jung has been MIA
since he left the fishing spot.

339
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,982
He never came back to his motel room.

340
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,695
How are Kim Seong-hui
and Park Jun-tae doing?

341
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,365
They're both refusing to speak now.

342
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,909
About Mr. Park…

343
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:33,412
Since he learned the body went missing,
he stopped answering questions.

344
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:39,418
Of course, he won't talk.
His dad is about to go to prison too.

345
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,213
We must request an arrest warrant
for Kim within four hours now.

346
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:44,965
Do we know the woman
on the back of the motorcycle yet?

347
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,509
Not yet.

348
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,636
Once we catch Jung,
we can solve all these.

349
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,682
Captain, I need you
to take a look at this.

350
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,268
What's this?

351
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,812
It's a photo of the scene.

352
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,313
Who took this photo?

353
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,941
We just received it,
but we don't know who sent it.

354
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:04,193
I wonder why they sent
a part of the photo.

355
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,320
Is this all we got?

356
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,373
You can send whatever photos you want.

357
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,835
But your son won't be released.

358
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,421
I said you have one day.

359
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:08,007
He turned himself in.

360
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,384
He said he killed
both Choi Yeong-min and Song Min-a.

361
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:12,636
Why?

362
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,140
Why did he kill them?

363
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,768
Are you sure Jun-tae killed them?

364
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:24,857
I know you don't care who you arrest,

365
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:28,486
but my son, Jun-tae, is innocent.

366
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,740
Do whatever it takes to get my son out.

367
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,784
Or I'll send them your daughter's photo.

368
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:55,012
What kind of person do you think Park is?

369
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,768
He's pretty selfless.

370
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,687
He's trying to sacrifice himself
to protect the accomplice.

371
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,149
I don't know if I should say this,

372
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,446
but the more I get to know him,
the more confused I become.

373
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,117
Do you guys think

374
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:22,623
there's a chance
that Park isn't the culprit?

375
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:25,042
He's definitely hiding something.

376
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,338
The reason why he lied to us
was to protect his father,

377
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,714
who was an accomplice.

378
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,967
If that was his purpose,

379
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,135
why'd he confess
about the Song Min-a case too?

380
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,512
I'm with you.

381
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,557
I think it's difficult to say

382
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,727
that Jung is directly involved
in this case.

383
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:47,982
There are no connections
between him and the victims either.

384
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,316
And most of his past crimes

385
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,444
were impulsive
and committed under the influence.

386
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:57,324
It's definitely different from our case.

387
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,618
What if it's not Jung
that he's trying to protect?

388
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,748
Someone who has connections
with all victims

389
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:09,003
and has a close emotional bond
with Park Jun-tae…

390
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:13,674
It's Kim Seong-hui.

391
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,062
Jun-tae.

392
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,439
What's wrong?

393
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,066
Did something happen?

394
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,115
Seong-hui,
we should stop seeing each other.

395
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,869
That's the right thing to do.
We should've stopped even sooner.

396
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,706
I'll be honest with you, Seong-hui.

397
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,712
I met Choi Yeong-min again yesterday.

398
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,010
And I saw you…

399
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:02,097
running away.

400
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,184
I know.

401
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,272
I know that
you haven't been able to report him

402
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,399
for his assaults because of me.

403
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:15,819
I've been turning a blind eye
to your suffering.

404
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,115
I killed Choi Yeong-min.

405
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:27,456
If you get arrested, don't say anything.
I'll take care of everything.

406
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,209
What are you talking about?

407
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,086
You can't get arrested.
Think about Do-yun.

408
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,551
Seong-hui.

409
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,889
Just promise me this one thing.

410
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,396
Please don't tell anyone…

411
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,442
what happened on the day Min-a died.

412
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:21,301
KIM SEONG-HUI, 33
OWNER OF THE RUNAWAY GANG'S HOUSE

413
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,597
I think you should see this.

414
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:32,146
APPLICATION FOR TRANSFER
OF OWNERSHIP REGISTRATION

415
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,399
APPLICANT: KIM SEONG-HUI

416
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,907
This is where the truck was
last caught on camera.

417
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,993
I'm sure he tried to dump the body.

418
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,494
-Give me the map.
-Here.

419
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:51,623
There are many mountains here.
Including all the fishing spots and lakes.

420
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,000
This area is too big.

421
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,546
MOUNT HWAYEON
HWAYEON LAKE

422
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,131
Hang on.

423
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,301
This area is not too far away…

424
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:04,761
from Mount Daehwa.

425
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,388
MOUNT DAEHWA

426
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,807
Right. But do you think
he buried the body there?

427
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:13,353
-It's where the body was dismembered.
-Maybe he thought it would be safe.

428
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,773
Because we already searched that mountain.

429
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,653
-Let's go to Mount Daehwa.
-Yes, sir.

430
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:27,159
How is it going over there? Anything?

431
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:29,536
-Look everywhere.
-Yes, sir.

432
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,376
Captain, there's something here.

433
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,296
Let's lift it in three, two, one.

434
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:41,173
Hey, be gentle.

435
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:42,716
-Okay.
-Don't destroy it.

436
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:52,267
Yes. Okay.

437
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:54,686
Captain.

438
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,564
Jung's truck has been found.

439
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:00,442
He fled without it so we can't track him.

440
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,110
Send the body to the NFS first.

441
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:08,033
We found…

442
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,495
Song Min-a's body.

443
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,294
What's wrong? Is it hard to look at it?

444
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:24,466
Why did you kill her?

445
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:30,305
I don't believe…

446
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,769
that you killed Song Min-a.

447
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:41,400
Are you still trying
to protect Kim Seong-hui?

448
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,070
I said I'm not.

449
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:48,115
Lee Su-hyeon, Song Min-a,
and Choi Yeong-min…

450
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,452
All the victims lived
in Kim Seong-hui's house.

451
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,083
Including Kim's husband,

452
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:04,256
a total of four people died in that house.

453
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,800
What are you talking about?

454
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:08,510
After her husband's death…

455
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:12,097
Kim Seong-hui became…

456
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,766
KIM SEONG-HUI

457
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,686
KIM SEONG-HUI

458
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,229
…the owner of the house.

459
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:23,483
You can't say that based on assumptions.

460
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,235
Then tell me the truth.

461
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,946
Why did you kill Song Min-a?

462
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:32,200
You keep lying to us
to protect Kim Seong-hui, right?

463
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:34,244
No. I already told you!

464
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,203
Then tell me.

465
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:39,625
Are you still worried about Kim Seong-hui?

466
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:49,885
I know that…

467
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,013
you can't do such a--

468
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,640
I was trying to rape her.

469
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,314
Then she resisted…

470
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,859
so I strangled her to death.

471
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:12,407
I wanted to keep it a secret forever.
Are you happy now?

472
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,330
Now, you know what a scumbag…

473
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:21,708
I am.

474
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,894
Mr. Park. Let me take you outside.

475
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:58,870
Rapists usually don't have
any sympathy for their victims.

476
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:03,375
Even if he were to admit what he did,
he would've blamed Song Min-a.

477
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:07,045
Park isn't the kind of person
who can just attack and kill--

478
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,130
Look.

479
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:11,299
Why do you keep saying that?
We even found the body now.

480
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,844
Everything is falling into place.

481
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,513
He raped and murdered Song Min-a.

482
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:19,141
Choi found out and blackmailed him,
so he killed him too.

483
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:20,225
Captain.

484
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:24,146
Based on the reaction Park showed
when he made the confession,

485
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:26,273
it's unlikely that it was a lie.

486
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,443
Maybe there was an error in the profiling.

487
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,739
I'll get ready for the Lee Su-hyeon case.

488
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,324
What about Kim Seong-hui?

489
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,744
We should request the warrant soon.

490
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:41,580
Check with her one last time.

491
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:42,706
Yes, sir.

492
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:45,751
Captain, I think
we just located Jung Du-cheol.

493
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,335
-Where is he?
-Here.

494
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:59,681
I just wanted to say,
thanks for everything.

495
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:00,974
It's nothing, really.

496
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,606
Goodbye.

497
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:18,074
Why was she thanking you?

498
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:20,702
Nothing important.

499
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:12,939
It wasn't because of you.

500
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:31,458
If I hadn't…

501
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,046
doubted you back then,

502
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,177
your mom wouldn't have believed it.

503
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:48,892
I'm the one…

504
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:54,272
who did that to your mom.

505
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:00,487
You could've told me
about the recordings earlier.

506
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:04,199
Why…

507
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,662
Why did you let me hate Mom all this time?

508
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,384
When I moved back in
to live with you again,

509
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,139
I didn't want to screw it up.

510
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:34,521
I knew…

511
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:38,984
it would be the last chance for me.

512
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:50,680
I'll stop here.

513
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:58,646
I don't want to ruin my life
because of Mom.

514
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:03,651
I promise…

515
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,739
I will catch the culprit.

516
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:33,306
-Hi.
-Good morning.

517
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:43,942
Jang Ha-bin!

518
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:49,739
When does the exam start?

519
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:52,992
From the third.
You can borrow the notes I took.

520
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,035
Thanks.

521
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,704
-Su-hyeon!
-Come on. Let's go!

522
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,916
-I'll see you in the classroom.
-Okay.

523
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,850
It's Su-hyeon. Lee Su-hyeon.

524
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:19,561
It's such a pretty name, right?

525
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:34,135
Captain.

526
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,679
I think Park gave us a false confession.

527
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:38,765
What do you mean?

528
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:41,392
We received
the first autopsy report this morning.

529
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:45,313
Strangulation usually leads
to a broken hyoid bone, right?

530
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:46,940
But her hyoid was fine.

531
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:54,113
Then what was the cause of death?

532
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,907
We didn't get the result yet.

533
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,994
I don't think he strangled her.

534
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:02,330
He lied again.

535
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,582
Where's Park Jun-tae now?

536
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:11,422
Hurry and get out of the car!

537
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,050
When was Jung located again?

538
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,134
Thirty minutes ago.

539
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:18,429
Thirty minutes ago?
Start the search now. We don't have time.

540
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:20,431
-I'll go this way first.
-I'll go this way.

541
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,100
Gyu-seok, Choi, Jang, follow me.

542
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:23,643
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

543
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:24,936
Check all the motorcycles.

544
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:25,979
Yes, sir.

545
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,580
Captain!

546
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:46,249
Detective Cho. Did you find anything?

547
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:49,127
We got the information about
who bought the necklace.

548
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:50,044
Let me see.

549
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,922
And it turns out that she died last year.

550
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,092
-She died?
-Yes.

551
00:59:57,510 --> 01:00:01,389
PURCHASE HISTORY
NAME: YOON JI-SU

552
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:05,351
ADDRESS: 42-24, DOWOON-RO,
SEO-GU, YEONJU-SI

553
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,611
What's the matter?

554
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:24,704
When did you start suspecting
Captain Jang's daughter?

555
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:26,789
Why are you asking?

556
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:29,626
The necklace found at the scene
where Choi died…

557
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,670
turned out
to be Captain Jang's dead wife's.

558
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:41,387
You've been suspicious of her.
Was there anything else?

559
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,190
What are you going to do?

560
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:57,278
I need to ask Captain Jang about this.

561
01:00:58,071 --> 01:00:58,946
Don't.

562
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:16,881
FORENSIC SCIENCE

563
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:18,174
Where did you get this?

564
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:24,764
Did we get the result?

565
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:28,685
This matches with the DNA
from the necklace found at the scene.

566
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:33,481
Was Park's accomplice caught?

567
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:38,736
Captain.

568
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:52,875
What happened on the day Song Min-a died?

569
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:56,671
That day,

570
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,134
Min-a was supposed to come
and pick up her stuff.

571
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:05,179
Seong-hui took Do-yun to the hospital,

572
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,266
so I was the only one at home.

573
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,355
I pushed her…

574
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:21,946
put my belt around her neck…

575
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,657
and kept tightening it.

576
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:28,786
Are you saying you strangled her to death?

577
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:30,413
Yes.

578
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:43,176
This is the autopsy report.

579
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:49,056
It shows she wasn't strangled to death.

580
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:56,981
Do you still think I'm lying?

581
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:04,864
I'm telling you the truth.

582
01:03:06,657 --> 01:03:08,659
You don't have to test me with this.

583
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:11,871
This autopsy report is real.

584
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:15,583
It really was me. I killed her.

585
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:20,880
What did you talk about with her that day?

586
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,094
You didn't kill her right away, did you?

587
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:32,767
Mr. Park.

588
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:41,025
I had a drink that day,
so I can't remember correctly.

589
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:48,032
You can't remember correctly?

590
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:52,745
What time did you meet Song Min-a?

591
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,873
Did you strangle her to death?

592
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:59,418
-Yes.
-Did you really strangle her to death?

593
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:04,507
What color were the clothes
she was wearing that day?

594
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:10,847
Are you sure you remember correctly?

595
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,937
I asked, are you sure
you remember correctly?

596
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:29,175
Min…

597
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:31,469
Min-a.

598
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:35,348
Min-a, wake up. Min-a!

599
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:37,934
Min-a.

600
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:45,608
Min-a.

601
01:05:50,988 --> 01:05:51,864
Jun-tae.

602
01:05:56,243 --> 01:06:00,873
Seong-hui, I don't know what happened.
I woke up and she was already…

603
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:04,001
Seong-hui, I didn't do it. I really…

604
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:05,586
It wasn't me.

605
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,254
Just blame the alcohol.

606
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:12,426
You said your dad had beaten
someone to death before

607
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:14,553
while he was drunk.

608
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:24,271
What do we do?

609
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:31,988
Oh no…

610
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:33,781
Jun-tae.

611
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:41,539
No.

612
01:06:43,624 --> 01:06:44,709
It was a mistake.

613
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:48,337
Jun-tae, this was a mistake.

614
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:50,548
You're a good person.

615
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:52,717
Nothing bad can happen to you.

616
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,428
This was just a mistake.

617
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:58,347
What if something happens to you?

618
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:02,852
You made a mistake after getting drunk.
It was just a drunken mistake.

619
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:04,311
Then…

620
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:09,400
how did Min-a die?

621
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:20,202
Mr. Park, was there perhaps…

622
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:16,175
From this moment on, Jang Ha-bin
is a suspect in Choi's murder case,

623
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:22,014
and you'll be removed from
the investigation.

624
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:01,387
Where's the bag with the evidence?

625
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,097
It's gone. I burned it.

626
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,517
Jeez, she really is something.

627
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,312
She most likely approached
Song and Choi to murder them.

628
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:14,108
It's all my fault.

629
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:17,111
I should've kicked out

630
01:09:18,028 --> 01:09:20,197
the runaway kids.

631
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:22,032
Ha-bin.

632
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:25,035
Just listen to me this one time.

633
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:28,205
Until your innocence is proven,

634
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:32,001
please just do as I say.

635
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:37,089
