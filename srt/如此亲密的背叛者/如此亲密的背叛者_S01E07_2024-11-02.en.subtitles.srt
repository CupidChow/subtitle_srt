1
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,675
You…

2
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,282
-Ha-bin.
-Move.

3
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,701
I won't be framed for this.

4
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,453
-Ha-bin.
-Let go!

5
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,047
Wait. What was that sound?

6
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,364
Choi Yeong-min.

7
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,575
-Hey! Choi!
-Choi!

8
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,160
Hey.

9
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,499
Report to the situation room.

10
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,626
-Call the forensic team too. Quick.
-On it.

11
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,421
Detective Lee, notify the team.
Detective Park, with me.

12
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,423
Yes, sir.

13
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,008
Situation update.

14
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:25,390
We found Choi's body on the second floor.
The suspect may have fled the scene.

15
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,990
What happened there?

16
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,452
Why were you there with Choi Yeong-min--

17
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,121
Stop beating around the bush.

18
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,207
Ask me if I killed him.

19
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,508
What did you mean when you said
you won't be framed for it?

20
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,890
Was someone else there?

21
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,604
Have you changed your plan?

22
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,402
Are you pretending to trust me

23
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,322
to get me to confess?

24
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:36,836
I'm not pretending.

25
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:47,305
I'll believe what you say now.

26
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:49,891
So tell me.

27
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,279
There were two weapons.

28
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:06,699
The stab wound on the knee
was made by something pointy,

29
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,659
but not the one on the neck.

30
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,120
Why do you think
they used different weapons?

31
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,414
Maybe it wasn't a sole offender.

32
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:18,002
There's a chance that
one culprit used multiple weapons.

33
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:23,174
Looking at the tie marks
and how they knew where Choi was hiding,

34
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,426
they must have known him
and had everything planned.

35
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,844
What we can say for sure is

36
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,098
that they had a good enough reason

37
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,017
to find and kill the man in hiding.

38
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,441
Collect the DNA samples
and send them to the NFS immediately.

39
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,525
Yes, sir.

40
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,663
Explain what happened.

41
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,467
When I went back,

42
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,762
Choi Yeong-min was already dead.

43
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:40,228
Did you see who did it?

44
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,023
No.

45
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,615
How did you know
Choi Yeong-min was hiding there?

46
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,243
I knew it

47
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,371
because I followed him.

48
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,790
Alone?

49
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,668
Yes.

50
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,629
Why did you go back to him?

51
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,382
To ask him something.

52
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,342
Ask him what?

53
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,805
The real culprit who killed Su-hyeon.

54
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:24,730
Mom thought I did it,
so she buried the body…

55
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,652
and committed suicide out of guilt.

56
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,904
I get it.

57
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,204
But it wouldn't have happened
if Su-hyeon hadn't been killed.

58
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,960
What's your plan now?

59
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,591
Why did you get me out of there?

60
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,247
The body has been transferred earlier,

61
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,540
so check this instead.

62
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,587
We'll have to wait
for the autopsy to be sure,

63
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,382
but the cause of death
seems to be exsanguination.

64
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,509
The forensic team has confirmed

65
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,261
that the culprit used
two different knives.

66
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,018
Could there be two culprits?

67
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,021
I'm not sure.
Just because there were two weapons,

68
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,564
doesn't mean there were two--

69
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:34,235
The ripped wound on the neck
shows that the blade was dull.

70
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,405
Meanwhile, the wound on the knee

71
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,032
was made with a sharp knife,
which makes it a good weapon.

72
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,951
The person who attacked his leg

73
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,745
might not be the same person
as the one who killed him.

74
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:30,541
The forensic team must have missed it.
I'll submit it when I get to the station.

75
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,804
If there really are two culprits,

76
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,057
one of them might be a woman.

77
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,581
Is this Hansol Youth Shelter?

78
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,376
I'm calling from Yeonju Police Station.

79
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,921
We need the contact info
of Song Min-a's family regarding the case.

80
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,424
I already gave you
her aunt's phone number.

81
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,803
Do you know her father's phone number?

82
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,057
Both of Min-a's parents passed away.

83
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,534
What is it that you wanted to say?

84
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,546
Choi Yeong-min is dead.

85
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,383
Jang Ha-bin killed him.

86
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,594
What…

87
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,345
I saw it with my own eyes.

88
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,560
Now, we have an ace up our sleeve.

89
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,854
Her dad is a cop.

90
00:14:56,937 --> 00:15:00,190
He's going to do anything
to prevent her from going to prison.

91
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,526
You don't have to worry anymore.

92
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,446
Are you telling me
to blackmail my student's parent?

93
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,655
Just so you know.

94
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,741
I'll take care of the rest.

95
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,331
One thing that bothers me is…

96
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:20,961
the woman you're seeing.

97
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,256
What about Seong-hui?

98
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,217
She knows what happened that day.

99
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,554
She won't do anything to hurt me.

100
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,849
She's not going to stick by your side
with the cops poking around and all.

101
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,225
Seong-hui has been through

102
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,062
a lot because of me.

103
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,690
Even if she tells the cops,
I won't blame her.

104
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:46,570
That single mom is clinging to you
because you're so naive.

105
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,948
You don't know what you're talking about.

106
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,574
You've got to nip it in the bud!

107
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,118
Say one more thing,

108
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,245
and I will cut ties with you again.

109
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,004
Mom.

110
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,297
Why are you up so early?

111
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,383
Where have you been?

112
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,677
I was just

113
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,055
meeting with Mr. Park.

114
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:59,018
A police officer came yesterday.

115
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,102
To our place?

116
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:05,524
He showed me Mr. Park's photo
and asked me if I knew him.

117
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,110
And?

118
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,243
What did you tell him?

119
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,539
CHOI YEONG-MIN CASE
EVIDENCE: NECKLACE

120
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,207
A woman's necklace was found?

121
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,542
Yes.

122
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,919
We also found a brick nearby
with bloodstains on it.

123
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,589
If that's Choi's blood,

124
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,717
it could have been left
by the culprit during the struggle.

125
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,763
Could this necklace be Kim Seong-hui's?

126
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,390
The culprit is likely someone he knew.

127
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,351
When did she get home last night?

128
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,312
She wasn't home last night.

129
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,317
Bring her in. Tell her
that we just need her for references.

130
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,902
-Yes, sir.
-What about Park Jun-tae?

131
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,530
He left urgently
after getting a phone call yesterday.

132
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,032
Have you reached out to him?

133
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,784
I called him, but he wouldn't answer.

134
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,328
And it seems like

135
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,581
Park Jun-tae met Song Min-a
on the day she died.

136
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,250
He met who? Song Min-a?

137
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,294
Yes. Also,

138
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,464
it turns out
Min-a and Mr. Park knew each other.

139
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,132
Where did you hear that?

140
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,259
From Do-yun, Kim Seong-hui's son.

141
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,554
What? Why are you telling me that now?

142
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,085
Can I help you?

143
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,427
Hello, Mr. Park.

144
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,529
Can we have a minute?

145
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,366
I can't right now.
I'll reach out to you later.

146
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,162
Should I wait in the teachers' office?

147
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,889
Choi Yeong-min is dead.

148
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,391
How?

149
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,021
You don't seem surprised.

150
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,982
Did you know about it?

151
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,693
How could I?

152
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,823
Are you suspecting me now?

153
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:01,950
Of what?

154
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,414
I never said he was killed,

155
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,001
and you seem pretty sure it was murder.

156
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,298
Did everything go okay with…

157
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,927
what made you leave urgently yesterday?

158
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:24,723
-Yes.
-Was it perhaps related to Choi?

159
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,976
-No.
-To Kim Seong-hui, then?

160
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,938
I'm not obligated to answer that.

161
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,607
I just wonder if she knows too.

162
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,109
Knows what?

163
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,070
Song Min-a.

164
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:44,451
You knew Min-a well.

165
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,291
I'm not sure what you're trying to say.

166
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:55,504
Why did you meet Song Min-a that day?

167
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:08,058
What is it that you wanted to ask me?

168
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:15,065
You once lived with my daughter, Min-a,
so I thought you might know something.

169
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,987
I'd love to help,
but I don't know anything.

170
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,198
I'm sorry, sir.

171
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,995
I know you knew her well.

172
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:30,872
Pardon?

173
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,877
I think there's a misunderstanding.

174
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,725
You must be Do-yun.

175
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,603
Get back inside.

176
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,276
I know you saw Min-a that day.

177
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:10,537
Stop racking your brain to figure out
what I know and tell me what happened.

178
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,056
I'm the one who should call the police.

179
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,933
A person died in this house.

180
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,563
Do I seem like I'm joking?

181
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,195
What happened that day?

182
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:53,663
I'll tell you!

183
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,000
I'll tell you everything I know.

184
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,174
May 11th.

185
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,052
That's the day Song died.
You met her, right?

186
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,264
I'm not sure. I can't remember.

187
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,934
I'm not asking this out of curiosity.

188
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:15,936
I know you did.

189
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:23,985
To tell you the truth,

190
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,031
I met Choi Yeong-min
after leaving the police station.

191
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:34,329
He threatened me,
knowing that I was being investigated.

192
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,456
Threatened how?

193
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,544
He knew that once people found out
I was involved in a case where girls died,

194
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,297
the rumors would hurt my career.

195
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,387
His ridiculous threat did upset me,

196
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:55,642
but he was fine until I left him.

197
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,273
Was it really a ridiculous threat, though?

198
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,612
Yesterday, Choi told me
that he'd turn himself in,

199
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,740
saying he knew who the culprit was.

200
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,956
And as soon as he said that,
he got murdered…

201
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,586
and the last person he met
before he died was you, so--

202
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,588
I saw Ha-bin there yesterday.

203
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,595
It looks like you already knew

204
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,973
that Ha-bin met Choi Yeong-min too.

205
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,864
Why don't you come
to the station and officially state…

206
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,159
that you saw her yesterday?

207
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,703
And…

208
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:01,166
you'd better stop avoiding the interview.

209
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,967
Please don't make us believe

210
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,178
that you're the culprit
Choi was talking about.

211
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:19,142
Because if you are,
we'll arrest you at all costs.

212
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,318
I'll see you at the station later today.

213
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:37,827
We got Choi's call log.

214
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,914
He kept calling Kim Seong-hui
while he was on the run.

215
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:45,502
After ignoring his calls for a while,
she finally called him back,

216
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:48,046
which was around 1:00 a.m.,
the estimated time of his death.

217
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,131
Is Kim still not answering your calls?

218
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,216
We couldn't reach her,

219
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,635
so I sent Detective Cho to her house.

220
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,596
What's this number? 7658.

221
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,475
Well?

222
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:01,643
Captain.

223
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:08,316
CAPTAIN JANG TAE-SU

224
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,819
Where's Captain Jang right now?

225
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:49,899
That new place?

226
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,277
-He's so cute, isn't he?
-I know.

227
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:55,113
-I've always wanted to try that.
-Let's go.

228
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,662
What a coward.

229
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,543
What a piece of trash.

230
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:11,171
I LOVE YOU, MR. PARK

231
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,423
PLEASE GET WELL SOON, MR. PARK
IT MAKES US SAD

232
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,633
WE LOVE YOU, MR. PARK

233
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,927
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING,
MR. PARK

234
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,557
You weren't home that night?

235
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,935
After having dinner, my son had a fever,

236
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,397
so I took him to the emergency room.

237
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,192
-You're lying. Tell me the truth.
-It's the truth.

238
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,111
The hospital must have the record too.

239
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,988
Are you saying that girl…

240
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,784
I mean… Min-a was home alone then?

241
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:41,868
That was…

242
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,997
after she left the gang.

243
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,958
A man living downstairs named Yeong-min…

244
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,087
Yeong-min was…

245
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,092
looking for Min-a then.

246
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,260
And that day,

247
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,847
I suddenly got a call from Min-a.

248
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,161
Hello?

249
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,122
Ms. Kim, is Yeong-min home?

250
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,541
Are you Min-a?

251
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:30,625
Yes.

252
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:33,169
I want to pick up the stuff I left there.

253
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,672
I rented a car, so it won't take long.

254
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,007
Okay.

255
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,093
Get here safely.

256
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,149
Do-yun's fever won't come down.

257
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,487
This won't do.
I'll take him to the hospital.

258
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,741
-Let me come with you. I'll drive.
-I can take a taxi.

259
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:07,245
Min-a is coming to pick up her stuff,
so let her in when she's here.

260
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,252
Do-yun, let's go to the hospital.

261
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:30,995
Jun-tae…

262
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,491
Nobody was home.

263
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,661
I had to take my child to the hospital…

264
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,293
so I told Min-a the passcode
of the smart door lock.

265
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,797
All her stuff was gone,

266
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,842
so I thought she came by and left--

267
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,468
Don't you try to fool me.

268
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,055
I know you saw everything that day.

269
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,640
I really don't know.

270
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,809
I really don't.

271
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:38,730
Well…

272
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,025
I did hear Yeong-min say…

273
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,905
that he was going to take her down.

274
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,994
But I was too scared of his retaliation

275
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,664
to say anything to the police.

276
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,334
I'm sorry.

277
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,339
So you think…

278
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:09,135
Choi Yeong-min killed her.

279
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,658
Hello? This is the police.

280
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:32,951
Ms. Kim Seong-hui.

281
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:34,911
Are you in there?

282
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,749
This is the police. Is anyone in there?

283
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:41,876
She's not picking up.

284
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,379
Keep trying.

285
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,549
This is the police. Hello?

286
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:52,553
Ms. Kim Seong-hui!

287
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,776
We need to talk.

288
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,788
Why didn't you tell me
you had a phone call with Choi?

289
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,541
Do you hear me?

290
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,335
Why aren't you saying anything?

291
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:29,549
Why would a suspect call the police?

292
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,093
He wanted to turn himself in.

293
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,015
And?

294
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,475
I waited for him
where we were supposed to meet,

295
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,894
but he didn't show up.

296
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,772
Why didn't you tell us about it?

297
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,611
Seriously, I don't understand.

298
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,114
Why didn't you tell us about it?

299
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,291
I made a wrong decision.

300
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:07,003
What decision did you make
and how was it wrong?

301
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:11,424
I thought it would be better
to talk to him by myself.

302
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:15,845
You think you're so great, don't you?

303
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:21,476
I know you don't care about the team,

304
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,729
but if you told us that he wanted
to turn himself in

305
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,814
and made a plan to lure him out

306
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,900
we could've arrested him alive.

307
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:32,987
I'll take responsibility

308
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:36,074
for this mistake
after finding the culprit.

309
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,326
"Responsibility"?

310
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,289
Responsibility, my foot.

311
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,293
"It was Choi Yeong-min"?

312
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,642
All right, then.

313
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:46,894
Kim Seong-hui isn't home.

314
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,730
It's a bit sketchy
that she knew all three victims

315
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,608
and tried to call Choi before he died.

316
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,029
Check out what she was up to yesterday.

317
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,114
Yes, sir.

318
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,198
Captain.

319
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:02,118
Are you just going to let
Captain Jang off the hook?

320
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,830
He always acts like we don't exist.

321
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,748
We can't work with someone like that.

322
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,251
Other detectives can see that too.

323
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,339
What's up?

324
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,466
I have something to tell you.

325
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,260
What is it?

326
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:23,347
The reason Captain Jang
didn't tell us about the call with Choi

327
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,810
might be because of his daughter.

328
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:16,400
What does Captain Jang's daughter
have to do with the case?

329
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,486
Jang Ha-bin and Lee Su-hyeon

330
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,613
were close friends,
according to Park Jun-tae.

331
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,615
Officer Lee, can we talk first?

332
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:26,118
As you know, she was also involved
with Song Min-a before she died.

333
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,329
Her alibi has already been
confirmed for that.

334
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,414
Is there something else?

335
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,125
After interrogating Choi,
he definitely said

336
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,169
that he knew Captain Jang.

337
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,254
Wait.

338
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:40,591
Are you saying they knew each other
even before the interrogation?

339
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,426
Yes.

340
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,511
From where he's from

341
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,305
to the crimes he's committed,
I looked into everything,

342
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,933
but he had no overlaps with Captain Jang.

343
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,522
I think they got to know each other

344
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,400
through his daughter.

345
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,360
And?

346
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:04,282
We need to investigate Jang Ha-bin.

347
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,658
Sorry to interrupt…

348
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,745
but I think you should listen to this.

349
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:10,830
I'm sorry.

350
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:15,543
I have an urgent tip to report
but I don't know the detective's number.

351
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,129
It's Jang Tae-su.

352
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,050
Choi's phone records showed that
he called the police

353
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,678
before he contacted Captain Jang.

354
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:30,516
If they had known each other already,
he would've known Captain Jang's number.

355
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,436
He kept it a secret even after Choi died.

356
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,229
-There must be a reason--
-Of course, there is.

357
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,149
That's why he acted alone
and messed up the investigation.

358
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,027
Aside from everything else,

359
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,904
I think he should take
full responsibility.

360
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,114
For now,

361
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,575
we have to fix this first.

362
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,370
I understand what you're saying,

363
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,248
so let's revisit this
once the investigation is over.

364
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,009
Get ready
for an interview with Park Jun-tae.

365
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:07,928
Did you find something?

366
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:11,640
He admitted
that he met Choi Yeong-min yesterday.

367
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,478
Did you meet Park Jun-tae alone?

368
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,271
He's coming later.

369
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,190
But that alone isn't enough

370
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,776
to prove he's the culprit.

371
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,403
We didn't get to have

372
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,531
a proper meeting today.

373
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,328
Profiling is
about identifying the culprit,

374
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,288
not pushing a specific suspect.

375
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,500
You know that better than anyone.

376
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:42,004
He met Choi Yeong-min before he died.

377
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,883
That is the single most important fact.

378
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,458
Why did you meet Seong-hui?

379
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,044
What if she said I killed Min-a?

380
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,963
What were you going to do then?

381
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,757
Everything I could do.

382
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,638
There are
too many sketchy people around you.

383
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,474
Choi Yeong-min.

384
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,225
Jang Ha-bin.

385
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:24,064
And the woman you're dating.
They're all so sketchy.

386
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,777
Let me be clear.
Never meet Seong-hui ever again.

387
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,369
Song Min-a.

388
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,790
Did you really kill her?

389
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,337
You saw it yourself that day.

390
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:48,589
Why did you kill her?

391
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,218
Tell me!

392
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,428
Why did you kill her?

393
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,852
Did you really kill her?

394
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:05,940
I told you. I killed her.

395
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,525
But why…

396
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:14,657
Why can't you say anything?

397
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:24,500
Why would you, an ordinary school teacher,

398
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,002
kill a person?

399
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,380
Why?

400
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,216
Why?

401
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,887
Maybe it runs in the family.

402
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,060
You…

403
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,941
You're not like me.

404
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,152
You're different.

405
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,574
What do you know about me?

406
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:02,580
I just know.

407
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:11,755
You didn't do it.

408
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,365
How can I help you?

409
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,412
I recently got pickpocketed around here.

410
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:45,956
He was riding a motorcycle.

411
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,711
It seemed like
he was caught by the police.

412
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:53,464
Do you remember the time and location?

413
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,382
In the alley near Mihwa Elementary School.

414
00:43:55,966 --> 00:44:00,512
It was on the 21st,
and the police came around 2:00 p.m.

415
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:02,890
Could you sit there and wait?

416
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:05,392
Is there a female police officer here?

417
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,727
Do you need something?

418
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,395
Yes.

419
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,273
Give me a second.

420
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,662
Where did she go?

421
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,497
It looks like she left.

422
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,375
But she was here just now.

423
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:40,511
JUNG DU-CHEOL

424
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,571
What?

425
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:04,034
Let me ask you one last time.

426
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:07,413
Are you sure

427
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:11,625
that nobody saw you at the scene that day?

428
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:17,923
Someone saw you there.

429
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:22,469
Who is that?

430
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,224
What's this about?

431
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:32,104
Do you think
I'm the culprit, not that person?

432
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,357
That's not why I'm asking this.

433
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:37,860
Then why are you asking?

434
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:42,197
I'm afraid that I might not…

435
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:46,452
be able to prove it wasn't you.

436
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,164
That's why I'm asking.

437
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,499
Are you sure…

438
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:56,003
you told me…

439
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:00,174
everything?

440
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,426
I already answered your question,

441
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,305
and it's your choice to believe it or not.

442
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,143
Okay.

443
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:15,230
That's all I needed to know.

444
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:28,994
TAE-SU

445
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:13,747
Are you still suspicious
of what Captain Jang did?

446
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:19,586
You must think…

447
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,298
I'm overly suspicious.

448
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,470
"I wish my doubts were wrong."

449
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:32,558
I thought that's how you might be feeling.

450
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:39,856
When you truly want to understand someone,

451
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:43,277
but you can't…

452
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:47,406
you end up having doubts.

453
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:52,119
You can't trust your own judgment,

454
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,163
but you can't help it.

455
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:18,385
DAD

456
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:26,768
MISSED CALLS

457
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:45,745
FROM NOW ON,
ANSWER WHEN I CALL IF YOU WANT

458
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:48,498
TO KEEP WHAT HAPPENED
AT MOUNT DAEHWA A SECRET

459
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:21,281
FROM JUNG DU-CHEOL

460
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:25,035
TO PARK JUN-TAE

461
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:40,759
Jun-tae.

462
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,014
What's wrong? Did something happen?

463
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,064
Seong-hui,
we should stop seeing each other.

464
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:58,777
That's the right thing to do.
We should've stopped even sooner.

465
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,282
Is this because of Min-a's dad?

466
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:07,452
If you're worried about me--

467
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:08,995
He's my dad.

468
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,165
What do you mean?

469
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,377
Don't worry.
He'll never reach out to you anymore.

470
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:22,759
-Jun-tae.
-I'll be honest with you, Seong-hui.

471
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,764
I met Choi Yeong-min again yesterday.

472
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,851
After I left?

473
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:38,149
Why?

474
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:41,069
I was afraid he might call the police.

475
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:46,074
I didn't care if he reported me,
but I wanted you to be safe.

476
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,785
So I went to convince him.

477
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:50,537
But then…

478
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:03,508
This was near the redevelopment site
around the estimated time of Choi's death.

479
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:06,678
So there's a chance
she called him there and then met him.

480
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,221
-Yes.
-Okay.

481
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:11,266
Good. This should be enough
to get the warrant.

482
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:14,019
Request Kim Seong-hui's live location
and prepare to dispatch.

483
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,103
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

484
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:39,169
Ms. Kim, you are under arrest
on suspicion of the murder of Choi.

485
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:40,295
-What?
-Arrest her.

486
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:41,546
-Yes, sir.
-Wait.

487
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:44,966
You have the right to an attorney.
You can request an arrest review.

488
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,926
-You can defend yourself later.
-No.

489
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,928
-Take her.
-It's a misunderstanding.

490
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,138
Yes, sir.

491
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:52,599
-Take her to the interrogation room.
-Yes, sir.

492
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,775
You met Choi Yeong-min yesterday, right?

493
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,737
Why did you call him?

494
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:10,283
I wanted to tell him not to call me.

495
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,328
That's why I called him.

496
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:14,788
Why, all of a sudden?

497
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:18,792
You had been ignoring his calls before.

498
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,880
You must've had a reason.

499
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:32,472
You met Choi Yeong-min yesterday, right?

500
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:36,267
Yes.

501
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,148
With Park Jun-tae?

502
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:49,906
Yeong-min kidnapped me.

503
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,450
Then he called Jun-tae using my phone.

504
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,411
That's why I met him.

505
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,956
Jun-tae came because of me.

506
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:00,250
Then what happened?

507
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,672
Nothing happened.

508
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:08,758
Really, nothing happened.

509
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:12,262
What time did you and Mr. Park part ways?

510
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:16,850
What time was it?

511
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:21,729
What is it?

512
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:23,690
Park Jun-tae is here.

513
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,442
No.

514
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:27,944
Make him wait in another room.
We need to interview her first.

515
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:29,612
Captain. But…

516
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:40,999
Park Jun-tae turned himself in?

517
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:42,417
Yes.

518
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,711
He even brought a knife,
saying that he killed him.

519
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:28,421
Jun-tae was arrested?

520
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,300
What did they find?

521
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:33,593
Jun-tae

522
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:36,179
killed Yeong-min.

523
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:39,265
That's nonsense!
Why would he kill Choi Yeong-min?

524
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,809
I thought you should know,

525
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,811
-so I convinced Jun-tae and called you.
-No…

526
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,271
No. That can't be true.

527
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:49,692
I saw her.

528
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:52,946
I saw everything.

529
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:12,483
That way.

530
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:14,360
-Go that way.
-Yes, sir.

531
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:15,737
-You go that way.
-Yes, sir.

532
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:13,044
I saw everything.

533
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:22,053
CHOI YEONG-MIN CASE
EVIDENCE: NECKLACE

534
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:25,431
It's not residential,
so there was no movement for an hour.

535
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:28,059
But I wonder
why he came back after one hour.

536
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:29,143
What is it?

537
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:32,772
I went through more CCTV footage
to see if Park's accomplice was filmed.

538
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:34,691
A motorcycle?

539
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:36,359
Yes.

540
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:39,320
This motorcycle's route
overlapped a lot with Park's car.

541
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:42,949
I thought it was a coincidence
as they went in different directions,

542
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,535
but it showed up again after an hour.

543
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:48,746
Do we have footage
from after the incident?

544
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:50,915
Not yet. We should look into it.

545
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:52,792
So there are two people.

546
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:55,712
Good. Keep digging
while we interview Park.

547
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:58,798
Check the name of the motorcycle
and print a photo of it.

548
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:00,466
Let's go interview Park now.

549
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:01,718
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

550
01:03:05,072 --> 01:03:06,407
Your mom's necklace

551
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:09,327
had your DNA on it.

552
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,170
He's not answering his phone.

553
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:22,632
When did he leave again?

554
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:26,844
He left when we were checking
the CCTV footage earlier.

555
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:31,098
And he didn't say where he was going?

556
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:32,308
No.

557
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:48,324
The day Song Min-a died…

558
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,577
you went to Mount Daehwa, right?

559
01:03:55,414 --> 01:03:56,791
I know

560
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:00,211
that you approached her
because of your mom.

561
01:04:01,128 --> 01:04:04,298
You told her
you would give her phone back,

562
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,135
and met her at the mountain that day.

563
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,639
"Did you lure her out and kill her?"

564
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:15,101
Just asked me directly.
Why beat around the bush?

565
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:18,855
You might be an accomplice
of the murderer who killed her.

566
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:21,649
Or…

567
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:24,235
a witness.

568
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:29,615
What I know for sure is

569
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,159
that you got hit by the car
at the mountain that day

570
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:35,955
and jumped in front of another car
to make up an alibi.

571
01:04:37,164 --> 01:04:38,457
If I was a mere witness,

572
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:41,252
why would I do that?

573
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:43,087
You're right.

574
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:47,091
That's why I suspected you too.

575
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:49,969
You can believe whatever you want.

576
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:53,681
I've been trying…

577
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:58,603
to put myself in your shoes.

578
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:01,772
If I were you…

579
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:06,777
would I tell my dad everything?

580
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:11,699
The dad who never trusts me

581
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:15,745
and the dad who lied that…

582
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:19,206
he didn't meet Mom when he did.

583
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,670
Would I have felt comfortable

584
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:27,423
confiding in my dad
after everything he did?

585
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,177
Thanks for understanding.

586
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,638
No matter how much you hated me…

587
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:39,894
you're not impulsive enough
to let that hatred frame you for murder.

588
01:05:43,814 --> 01:05:45,733
Then why did you keep it a secret?

589
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:51,447
What makes you willing to risk
being framed for murder?

590
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:01,457
Then I've come to a conclusion.

591
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,086
It's because…

592
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:09,674
you don't want me to catch
the culprit before you do.

593
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,262
You want to catch the culprit yourself…

594
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:20,393
and kill them.

595
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:31,028
Who was the motorcycle rider?

596
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:34,991
You know

597
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:37,410
that I won't tell you.

598
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:47,586
Who is that person?

599
01:06:55,594 --> 01:06:57,096
You can't arrest me.

600
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:08,816
What makes you think so?

601
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:13,487
Because the moment I get arrested,

602
01:07:15,072 --> 01:07:16,991
you will be removed
from the investigation team.

603
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:23,247
Because you know…

604
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:27,418
that I will find
and kill the culprit at all costs…

605
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:31,130
if you fail to find them first.

606
01:08:01,994 --> 01:08:07,625
MY DAUGHTER

607
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:26,268
MY DAUGHTER

608
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:48,791
Release Park Jun-tae.

609
01:08:52,586 --> 01:08:54,547
Or your daughter's life is over.

610
01:09:00,344 --> 01:09:01,512
I'll give you one day.

611
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:41,051
I did all that by myself.

612
01:09:41,635 --> 01:09:44,680
But the crime scene
we've investigated suggests otherwise.

613
01:09:44,763 --> 01:09:46,557
Park Jun-tae is lying.

614
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,100
You know that too.

615
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:54,440
When did you start suspecting
Captain Jang's daughter?

616
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,233
You must be Ha-bin.

617
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:05,034
I'm still scared…

618
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:11,123
he might hurt Ha-bin like that again.

619
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:17,129
