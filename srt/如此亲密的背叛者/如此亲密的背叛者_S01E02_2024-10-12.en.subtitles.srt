00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,624
JOINT PETITION FOR DIVORCE

2
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,508
I know you're going through a lot.

3
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,553
But this is not right.

4
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,975
You can do whatever you want to me.

5
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,310
But…

6
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,689
I can't let you ruin Ha-bin.

7
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,400
I told you. It was a mistake.

8
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,944
Are you sure it was a mistake?

9
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,031
Are you sure
it had nothing to do with Ha-bin?

10
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,332
Ji-su, I…

11
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,837
You must've gone mad,
dealing with criminals every day.

12
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,797
How could you…

13
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,675
How could you suspect Ha-bin?

14
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,033
A car accident?

15
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:24,037
We found signs of an accident
around the vehicle at the scene,

16
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,204
but it was unregistered.

17
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,789
It's hard to track the owner,

18
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,751
so we're checking
the car's routes with CCTV footage.

19
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,337
Are we sure it's the culprit's car?

20
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,673
Apparently, the culprit seems
to have left the car behind.

21
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,301
Did Captain Jang say that?

22
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,552
Yes.

23
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,138
Since he couldn't take the car with him,

24
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,932
he tried to burn it to destroy evidence.

25
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,226
Were there any fingerprints?

26
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,143
No.

27
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,481
Where's Captain Jang now?

28
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,786
I called her from the hospital.

29
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,538
I missed my grandma.

30
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,378
What's your intention behind calling her?

31
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,214
"Intention"?

32
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,925
That's a weird way to put it.

33
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,886
-You don't even talk to her often.
-I did call her for a reason.

34
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,764
My arm is like this
and I can hardly bend over.

35
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,307
I can't even wash my hair.

36
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,523
Unlock the door. I'm tired.

37
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:35,775
Where have you been?

38
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,319
Grandma is waiting.

39
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,071
Answer me first.

40
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:45,910
Grandma.

41
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,601
Hi, sweetie.

42
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,811
My baby.

43
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,940
How did you get hurt? What happened?

44
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,109
It's not that serious.

45
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,903
Are you really okay?

46
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,783
What's up?

47
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,373
-Oh, my goodness.
-I'm fine.

48
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,042
It doesn't hurt much.

49
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,878
Gosh, I'm so glad
it wasn't something serious.

50
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,671
You've gotten thinner.

51
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:42,925
Our first priority should be to figure out
who was driving the unregistered--

52
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,512
Sorry, I'm late, chief.

53
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:53,227
Our first priority should be to figure out
who was driving the unregistered car.

54
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,521
Keep your eyes on the screen, please.

55
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:59,025
Here's the footage we've found
while investigating the car.

56
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,819
DAEHWA REST STOP, 294 SEONGSAN

57
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,824
The forensic team is still working on it,

58
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:11,245
but we've found out that
it's a woman who is about 168cm tall.

59
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,000
Based on her outfit,
she seems to be a younger woman.

60
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,169
She could be in her teens or 20s.

61
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,050
What do you think, Captain Jang?

62
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,221
Captain Jang?

63
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,305
Yes?

64
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,557
What do you think?

65
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:33,935
I'm not sure.

66
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,562
Do we have any clearer footage?

67
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,940
Not at the moment.

68
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,025
We're still investigating
the car's routes.

69
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,777
Since it's an unregistered car,

70
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,530
we're looking into
illegal car rental businesses as well.

71
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:46,864
Detective Kim.

72
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:47,865
Yes.

73
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,371
The list we're handing out now contains
the phone numbers received and dialed

74
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,915
from the nearby cell towers
on the day of the incident.

75
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,250
As you can see,

76
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,877
we have all the suspects'
personal information.

77
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,925
We're going to call
every one of them to check their alibi.

78
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:09,929
JANG HA-BIN

79
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,394
What do you think it is?

80
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:20,356
Well, there are
tons of different types of textiles, so…

81
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,901
Having a sample to compare
would make it much easier.

82
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,446
What about DNA?

83
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,405
There wasn't any.

84
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,160
But for now,
this is the most important evidence.

85
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,246
Whoever has this
was definitely at the scene.

86
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,250
It's vivid red.

87
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,585
What could it be?

88
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,338
Where did he go now?

89
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,757
I think he's out for a minute.

90
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,843
I can see that too. Where did he go?

91
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,429
I'm not sure.

92
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,764
Does he think he's a detective or what?

93
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,725
Why is he always out of the office?

94
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,851
Should I call him?

95
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,227
Don't bother. Leave him be.

96
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,188
He must be sorting his thoughts somewhere.

97
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,773
As if he can solve the case
just by pondering.

98
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:06,569
By the way,
how's the progress on checking alibis?

99
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,030
I think we can finish it today.

100
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:41,497
Whoever has this
was definitely at the scene.

101
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,668
It's vivid red.

102
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,379
What could it be?

103
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,033
Did you step out for a bit?

104
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,834
Just for a quick walk.

105
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,212
Why are you home at this hour?

106
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,132
I forgot something at home.

107
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:41,844
I see.

108
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,877
Tae-su.

109
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,671
Open the door.

110
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,049
-Tae-su.
-Don't lie to me.

111
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,677
-Open the door!
-Look at my eyes.

112
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,971
-Tae-su.
-Why did you lie to me?

113
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,431
The police officers from earlier.

114
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,476
-They told me everything.
-Please open the door!

115
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,020
What did you do?

116
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,522
What did you do in the forest…

117
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,942
Ha-bin, get back here!

118
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,110
-Let go!
-Don't move.

119
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,653
-Let go of me!
-Don't move!

120
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,280
Don't move!

121
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,364
Look at me.

122
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,574
Stay still!

123
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,828
-Look at me.
-Let go of me!

124
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,371
-Look at me!
-No!

125
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,012
Ha-bin.

126
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,597
Mom.

127
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,474
Ha-bin.

128
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,872
I didn't kill anyone.

129
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,855
Honey.

130
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,365
Did you get hurt?

131
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:33,826
Tae-su.

132
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:58,058
RED MICROFIBER FOUND IN BUSH

133
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,818
Once we confirm her face,
it'll be only a matter of time.

134
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,028
We'll catch her soon.

135
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,112
Look who's here.

136
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,116
What's up? I thought
you just wanted to read the minutes.

137
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,410
I was checking for more evidence.

138
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,412
We found the owner
of the unregistered car.

139
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,623
He was already arrested
for illegal car rentals.

140
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,294
And it was indeed a woman
who rented the car.

141
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:27,963
What about her age?

142
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,300
He said she looked like
she was in her late teens.

143
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,801
But we'll see.

144
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,391
Hey. Sorry, I'm late.

145
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,480
We received the analysis report

146
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,857
on the victim's blood
found in the warehouse.

147
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,485
A small amount of liraglutide was found.

148
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,487
Lira… What? Is it a new kind of drug?

149
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,448
It's typically used to treat diabetes.

150
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,743
If the victim had diabetes,

151
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,244
she's likely an older woman.

152
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,915
It can be genetic,
so you can't say for sure,

153
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:03,957
but it is possible.

154
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,461
It's still too generic, but it gives us
some clues about the victim.

155
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,464
Sir, we have footage of the car renter.

156
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,632
-We did?
-Yes.

157
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:19,681
This is a parking lot
for unregistered cars in Sangseo-dong.

158
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,205
She's the same girl
as the one from the CCTV footage.

159
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,624
It's the same outfit.

160
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:46,834
Right.

161
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:47,960
Here.

162
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,586
And it's the same day.

163
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,673
Sangseo-dong is only 15 minutes from here.

164
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,182
Do we have her identity?

165
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:06,812
No. These days, you can rent those cars
online anonymously. It'll take a while.

166
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,440
Pull up the list of all facial data
we have archived for comparison.

167
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,485
Print out the close-up
and distribute to all nearby precincts.

168
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,363
Captain Jang,
what should we do with our meeting?

169
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,578
Oh, hi. What brings you here?

We're now reviewing
Song Min-a's medical record.

175
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,310
By the way, is everything okay these days?

176
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,941
Yes. I just want to crack this case
as soon as possible.

177
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:58,947
There's no record
of diabetes prescriptions or diagnoses.

WHERE ARE YOU?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

200
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,865
Damn it! You should've checked carefully.

201
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,116
I texted…

202
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,202
I texted him.

203
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,497
Damn it.

204
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,005

MOUNT DAEHWA MURDER CASE

206
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,795
About the hole that was dug…

207
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,297
Isn't it strange
that they chose that spot?

208
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,549
You're right.

209
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,968
It would've been easier
on a slanted surface.

210
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,846
What we've seen in the warehouse suggests

211
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:55,016
that the culprit controlled the scene
very meticulously.

212
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,854
But this hole
feels like it was dug randomly.

213
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,107
There are too many inconsistencies.

214
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,901
The meticulousness clashes
with disorganization.

215
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,908
By the way,

216
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,287
doesn't Captain Jang seem off lately?

217
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:20,375
He looks so down
and he's not attending our meetings.

218
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:25,589
Officer Gu, you're not very good
at reading the room, are you?

219
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,090
Why do you ask?

220
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:30,302
Do you know why we were scolded
during our first meeting?

221
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,140
Because we didn't voice our opinions,
walking on eggshells?

222
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,266
Exactly.

223
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:42,022
If a veteran like him drops his thoughts,
we won't be able to discuss freely.

224
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:46,318
Are you saying he's not coming
to the meetings for our sake?

225
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,236
He's trying to help us stay objective.

226
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,989
It was obvious to me.

227
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,784
I see.

228
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,451
Hey, Park Ji-yeon.

229
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:23,957
What's that car?

230
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,420
He's a cop.

231
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:35,719
Run.

There you are.

237
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,568
Song Min-a.

238
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:24,948
Did you meet her?

239
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,160
I know

240
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,913
that you went to Mount Daehwa

241
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:34,415
that day.

242
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,462
What are you talking about?

243
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,549
You jumped in front of the car on purpose.

244
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,468
Why would I?

245
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,514
Don't you dare lie to me.

246
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,977
I checked everything.

247
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,278
You're right.

248
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,115
I jumped in front of the car on purpose.

249
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,453
Because I wanted to die.

250
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:16,624
What?

251
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,378
I said I wanted to die.

252
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,009
I still can't believe

253
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,721
that Mom killed herself, leaving me alone.

254
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,060
I didn't want to go on the field trip.

255
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:40,565
I didn't want to chat and laugh there
as if nothing happened.

256
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,609
But living in this house is worse.

257
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,986
Living with you…

258
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,449
is just too hard for me.

259
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,163
I've never met Song Min-a.

260
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:58,875
Other than at the police station.

261
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,760
Could you please, for once…

262
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:17,018
just believe what I say?

263
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,453
What have you been
doing outside until now?

264
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,335
Geez.

265
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,380
I had no idea you were living like this.

266
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,176
I don't know what's going on,

267
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,846
but let it slide.

268
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,310
You've got to trust your child…

269
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:45,023
no matter what.

270
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,067
I wish I could.

271
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,533
But I really don't know…

272
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,914
if I should.

273
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,801
Thank you for using our service.

275
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,494
We've identified the girl
who rented the car.

276
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:22,829
Her name is Song Min-a.

277
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,497
She withdrew some cash last night.

278
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,291
Did we find her location?

279
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,419
Not yet. The ATM was
at a convenience store near the motel,

280
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,046
so we dispatched some officers.

281
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,215
We're checking all the places
related to her.

282
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,434
Just freaking stay low somewhere.

283
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,894
Stop calling me.

284
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,134
Behind that window…

285
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,719
Hey, there's someone here!

286
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:02,803
There's someone in here!

287
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:06,474
Hey! Open the door. I'm a cop.

288
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,642
-Open the door!
-Damn it!

289
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,397
Damn it.

290
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,783
You bastard, don't bother trying.
Just come out.

291
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,660
Fuck, seriously…

292
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,536
Choi Yeong-min, why did you run?

293
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,749
Look in the mirror.

294
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,419
It's because you looked horrifying.

295
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,592
This little brat…

296
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:46,138
Cut the crap and answer me.

297
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,224
Where's Song Min-a now?

298
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:54,647
Look at that.

299
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:58,609
What's all this money?

300
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,570
Geez, look at all these.

301
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,780
I worked and earned it.

302
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:06,158
Where were you going with all that money?

303
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,911
Song Min-a withdrew everything
from her account too.

304
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,664
Choi Yeong-min.

305
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,834
Where's Song Min-a?

306
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,047
I don't know.

307
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:25,261
Choi Yeong-min. Age 24.

308
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,930
He and Song Min-a
were once criminally charged

309
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,807
with illegal prostitution and assault.

310
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,769
That annoying punk.

311
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,813
He's definitely hiding something.

312
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:36,981
My gut is telling me.

313
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,736
Hey, did you find Song Min-a?

314
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:44,530
Call me when you do.

315
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,075
Aren't you going in?

316
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,038
You two go in.

317
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,292
This is urgent.
Why don't you do it yourself?

318
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,169
-What are you doing? Go in.
-Yes, sir.

319
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,057
What's your relationship with Song Min-a?

320
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:15,686
Please answer.

321
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,647
We just came across each other.
There's no relationship.

322
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,487
Have you ever been criminally charged?

323
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:31,994
-Why do you ask? You already know.
-These are already on the report.

324
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,704
They're wasting time on--

325
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,248
They're testing to see
if he's telling the truth.

326
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,001
We must understand
what kind of face he makes

327
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,253
and how his voice sounds
when he tells the truth,

328
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,422
to detect his lies.

329
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:46,384
When was the last time you saw Song Min-a?

330
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,346
-Mr. Choi?
-I'm tired.

331
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,725
Let me grab a smoke.

332
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,686
Tell us everything
about what you did on the 11th.

333
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,403
She's never
going to make him talk like that.

334
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,114
He won't.
Not until we get Song Min-a here.

335
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,454
When did Song Min-a…

336
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,748
-Come out.
-What are you doing?

337
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,501
We have to make him talk
to find Song Min-a.

338
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,003
He'll talk once she's here.

339
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:41,313
It's hard to tell
with his uncooperative attitude.

340
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,945
If Song Min-a is the culprit,

341
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:52,533
there's a chance
that Choi is her accomplice.

342
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,742
What's your reason?

343
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,121
The conflicted behavioral evidence
from the crime scene.

344
00:40:57,204 --> 00:41:00,040
This disorganization might be

345
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:03,043
the result of two individuals
with different personalities.

346
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:11,093
Once one of them starts talking,

347
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:14,680
they'll begin
to throw each other under the bus.

348
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,390
We must find Song Min-a first.

349
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:20,227
Actually, I found something.

350
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:24,732
This is Song Min-a's
private social media account.

351
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,195
It seems like she took the photos herself.

352
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,867
I wonder if she was trying
to keep records of some physical abuse.

353
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:35,993
Because…

354
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,163
Look. It's a bruise.

355
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,707
But a lot of them don't have those.

356
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:46,670
I wonder why
she posted similar photos every day.

357
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,673
Officer Gu, you found this problem,
so you find the answer too.

358
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,801
Okay. I'll give it a try.

359
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,638
What about me?

360
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:56,722
Follow me.

361
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:32,091
We're from the police.
May we ask you a few questions?

362
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:34,218
I already talked with the police earlier.

363
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,511
You own this place, right?

364
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,555
Yes, I do.

365
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,724
Do you know how many kids
are living in the basement?

366
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,643
I'm not sure.

367
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,730
A lot of kids come and go.

368
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:48,816
Have you perhaps

369
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,485
seen this girl lately?

370
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,615
I haven't seen anyone
in the last few days.

371
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,165
Do you have a family?

372
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,418
I have a son who is in elementary school.

373
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:12,006
Oh, this.

374
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:15,259
I fell down
while cleaning the house yesterday.

375
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:21,265
What about the kids, though?

376
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,851
Have you noticed
anything strange about them?

377
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,938
They're all just kids,
so they can be a little loud.

378
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:31,066
Could you give us a call
when they come back?

379
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,110
Especially the girl we showed to you.

380
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:35,613
Sure. I'll call you when I see her.

381
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,408
What's wrong?

382
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,951
She's lying.

383
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:42,786
About what?

384
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,747
The bruise isn't from yesterday.

385
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:48,584
Judging by how it looks,
it's been at least two days.

386
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:51,754
And she didn't get it from falling down.

387
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,174
I think she was abused.

388
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:00,471
She said she's living with a son, right?

389
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,731
You must be exhausted, Captain Jang.

390
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:15,611
Those who can see more things than others
have to ignore more things too.

391
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,621
Are you heading back already?

392
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,791
Ha-bin told me to,
saying I shouldn't leave the restaurant

393
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,043
closed for too long.

394
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:15,629
Where's Ha-bin now?

395
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:17,923
She's getting some snacks.

396
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,384
For me to munch on the bus.

397
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:24,471
She may look cold on the outside,

398
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27,766
-but she has a big heart. You know, right?
-Lighter.

399
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,101
Give me the lighter.

400
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,190
Maybe…

401
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,527
I was wrong.

402
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:43,115
Being a parent doesn't mean
you always have to be right.

403
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:44,283
It's okay.

404
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:48,078
I made some beef bone soup.

405
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,289
Make sure she eats well.

406
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:51,707
Have a safe trip home.

407
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:58,023
NO COMMENTS

408
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,866
Did you find something?

409
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:08,951
Yes.

410
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,621
Have some food first.

411
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,249
Geez, this is driving me crazy.

412
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,792
God damn it.

413
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,046
Sir.

414
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,423
We found Song Min-a.

415
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,801
-We found her? Where?
-Right here.

416
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:29,429
Here.

417
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:33,684
You're right. What's the room number?

418
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:35,602
-Room 601.
-Let's go.

419
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,116
This is Song Min-a's public account.

420
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,784
It's open to the public.

421
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:53,620
It has a bit of a braggy vibe,
but what about it?

422
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,455
It's her public account,

423
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,375
but she didn't post any of her photos.

424
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,294
Many people don't.

425
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,421
Do you think it's strange?

426
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,172
What's strange is

427
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:08,302
the gap between what she wants
to show others and hide from others

428
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,970
is too big.

429
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:13,348
I kept digging into it
while having that in mind.

430
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:16,518
And then I found that
she bought something second-hand online.

431
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:17,603
This is it.

432
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:18,520
WEIGHT-LOSS

433
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:21,231
-What's this?
-It's a weight-loss injection.

434
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:24,568
Looks like
she was obsessively trying to stay fit.

435
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:29,573
This drug is usually used
to treat diabetes or severe obesity.

436
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,283
Is it liraglutide?

437
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:33,535
Yes, it's liraglutide.

438
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:36,121
A small amount of liraglutide was found.

439
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,247
0.01 MG OF LIRAGLUTIDE

440
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:45,255
Song Min-a might be the victim.

441
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,092
-She grew up in an orphanage, right?
-Yes.

442
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:53,138
But I heard
the detectives are transporting her now.

443
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:57,684
Captain Jang.

444
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:18,580
Detective Kim. What happened?

445
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,958
We didn't find Song Min-a.

446
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,211
She's the one who used the card.

447
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:27,214
-Her name is Park Ji-yeon.
-Excuse me, sir.

448
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,257
Can I have five minutes?

449
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:30,676
I want to get some fresh air.

450
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:32,928
Please?

451
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,684
You must be tired.
Go grab a cup of coffee.

452
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:41,436
I'll have a quick bathroom break then.

453
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,449
You remember me, right?

454
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:58,912
We met at the police station.
Your daughter was there too.

455
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:01,498
I do.

456
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:04,835
Why are the police looking for Song Min-a?

457
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:08,630
When was the last time you saw Song Min-a?

458
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,382
I don't know.

459
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:15,345
Right. The day she said
she was going to meet your daughter.

460
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:17,764
That's when I last saw her.

461
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:25,439
It wasn't at the police station?

462
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:28,150
Did that bitch…
I mean, did your daughter say that?

463
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:30,444
I don't think that's true.

464
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,697
Tell me exactly when and why she met her.

465
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:37,784
If you want to know the answer,

466
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:42,205
promise me you'll let me out.

467
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:46,460
I didn't steal Song Min-a's money.

468
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:50,964
We saved the money together.
That's how I knew her PIN.

469
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,509
I don't need to be investigated.

470
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,435
Let me go.

471
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:10,025
Otherwise, I'll tell everyone
that your daughter met Song Min-a.

472
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:13,820
Let's go back inside. Come here.

473
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,301
Ha-bin!

474
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:39,679
-Jang Ha-bin!
-Jang Ha-bin!

475
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:42,766
-Ha-bin!
-Ha-bin!

476
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,559
Jang Ha-bin!

477
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:47,562
-Jang Ha-bin!
-Where did she go?

478
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,397
-Ha-bin!
-Ha-bin!

479
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:51,274
-Jang Ha-bin!
-Ha-bin!

480
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,443
Jang Ha-bin!

481
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,528
Ha-bin!

482
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:57,781
-Ha-bin!
-Ha-bin!

483
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:59,032
Ha-bin!

484
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:03,036
-Jang Ha-bin!
-Jang Ha-bin!

485
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,120
Ha-bin!

486
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:05,664
Ha-bin!

487
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,544
-Ha-bin!
-Ha-bin!

488
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,712
Jang Ha-bin!

489
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,109
Have you seen these children today?

490
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:36,653
-No, I haven't.
-No.

491
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:38,613
-You haven't either?
-No.

492
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,657
One boy and one girl.

493
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,951
-Right. Two kids.
-My goodness.

494
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:22,444
Song Min-a is the victim now?
Are you sure?

495
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:23,778
Well…

496
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:27,449
Some circumstantial evidence
indicated that she might not be,

497
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:29,826
but the DNA test confirmed
that she was the victim.

498
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:32,037
Who killed Song Min-a then?

499
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,914
For now, the runaway kids
are our prime suspects.

500
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:36,708
After Song Min-a died,

501
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:40,920
Choi Yeong-min tried to flee with cash,
and Park Ji-yeon stole her money too.

502
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:44,299
We're requesting a warrant
for Choi Yeong-min soon, right?

503
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:45,467
Yes.

504
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:49,095
Captain Jang, do you think
you can make him talk?

505
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,891
Choi Yeong-min isn't the kind of person
who would talk

506
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:56,061
when we threaten him
or try to appeal to his emotions.

507
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:58,646
We need hard evidence first.

508
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:02,358
And in order to find that evidence,
we need to get something out of him.

509
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:05,278
Who lays all their cards on the table

510
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:09,657
when their lives are on the line,
especially before the warrant is issued?

511
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:13,036
If you were the culprit, would you do it?

512
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:17,582
So you're going to do nothing
until the detectives find something?

513
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:21,002
If he is really the culprit,
he must be thinking now

514
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,881
about whether he's missing something

515
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:27,300
or if there's a chance
he might get caught.

516
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:31,387
Then he'll definitely make a move.

517
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:32,639
Hey, Choi Yeong-min.

518
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,103
It feels like we'll meet again.

519
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,188
I hope not.

520
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,986
That disrespectful brat.

521
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,696
Are the boys ready to follow?

522
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,658
Yes, they're on standby near the station.
They'll follow him now.

523
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:54,661
And Captain Jang said
he'd interrogate Park Ji-yeon himself.

524
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:56,704
-He did?
-Yes.

525
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:59,374
Cho, find out where the rest
of the runaway kids are.

526
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:01,584
-Let me know if you find anything.
-Will do.

527
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,002
How many more numbers to go?

528
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:05,088
Checked all
except those who didn't answer.

529
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:11,928
Let's go.
If they don't answer, we'll go find them.

530
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,805
I'll keep you posted.

531
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:17,434
So you're saying Song Min-a left the gang?

532
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:18,518
Yes.

533
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:23,398
And you saw her last

534
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,733
when you went to the motel room
she was staying at.

535
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:28,236
I fell asleep at some point,

536
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,447
and when I woke up, she was gone.

537
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,867
Did she say she was going to meet someone?

538
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:36,453
Did she gossip or fight
with someone recently?

539
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,288
Min-a…

540
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:45,336
She doesn't talk much about herself.

541
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,130
So I don't know.

542
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:53,887
When you last saw her,
did you notice anything different?

543
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:56,264
No.

544
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:58,725
She was the same as usual.

545
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:01,311
I see.

546
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:05,356
Captain Jang is going
to interrogate Park Ji-yeon.

547
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,902
He said Detective Park would be there,
so we don't have to come.

548
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:11,821
Darn it.

549
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,114
Are you disappointed?

550
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:16,659
SONG MIN-A

551
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,244
PARK JI-YEON

552
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,830
Both girls have been
on a lot of probation.

553
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,123
Runaway kids are

554
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:25,543
meant to be exposed to crimes.

555
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:28,963
Either they become victims
in unhealthy environments

556
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:31,132
or they turn to crime to survive.

557
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:35,094
A case has been filed
for Song Min-a recently.

558
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,095
When?

559
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,139
Two days before the day of the incident.

560
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,308
Same for Park Ji-yeon.

561
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,519
This is tricky.

562
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,687
She's saying
they saved the money together.

563
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,981
Without having Song Min-a present here,

564
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:48,983
we can't just charge her with theft.

565
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:52,904
What's her alibi?

566
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,990
We checked the CCTV from the motel.

567
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,367
She definitely has an alibi.

568
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,118
What should we do?

569
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:05,208
Let her go for now.

570
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,210
Okay.

571
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,594
You're free to go
as you agreed to answer our calls,

572
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:19,013
-but there may be a follow-up.
-Okay.

573
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,149
All right. Good night.

574
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:35,863
This one has an alibi.

575
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:37,282
We only have a few more left.

576
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:38,491
How many?

577
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,744
About 20.

578
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:44,455
JANG HA-BIN

579
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:48,918
VIOLENT CRIME DIVISION 1, 2, 3, 4

580
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:54,591
We're analyzing this now and…

581
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,426
That would be great. Thanks.

582
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:57,552
Good.

583
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,345
Who are you?

584
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:03,266
Hello.

585
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:05,435
I'm Captain Jang Tae-su's daughter.

586
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,357
He's not in at the moment.

587
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:14,527
I know he's busy.
I'll just leave his underwear here and go.

588
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:17,196
Sure. That's his desk.

589
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,198
Thank you.

590
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:56,861
PROGRESS REPORT ON MOUNT DAEHWA
MURDER AND ARSON CASE

591
01:00:56,944 --> 01:01:00,031
Tell me everything that you know.
And I mean, everything.

592
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:04,619
That day we met at the police station,

593
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:07,747
your daughter stole Song Min-a's phone.

594
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,166
Min-a said she lost her phone,

595
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:11,584
so I called her,

596
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:13,544
and Jang Ha-bin answered.

597
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,254
She said she found it somewhere.

598
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:23,096
Is Song Min-a's phone light blue?

599
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,013
Yes.

600
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:26,391
Jang Ha-bin said
she'd give her phone back,

601
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:27,934
so Min-a went out to get it.

602
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:31,521
When was it?

603
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:34,941
On the 11th.

604
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,778
That was the last day I saw her.

605
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:41,114
I never heard from her since.

606
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,784
By the way,

607
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,746
why are the police looking for Min-a?

608
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:53,292
Did Min-a…

609
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:55,795
die?

610
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,388
Captain Jang, where are you?

611
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:07,140
Your daughter was here.

612
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:53,060
RED MICROFIBER FOUND IN BUSH

613
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:40,316
-Here.
-Thank you.

614
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,443
Bye. Thank you so much.

615
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:44,111
-Bye. Take care.
-Bye.

616
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,084
-Just one more thing.
-Yes?

617
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:01,546
Do you remember anything
about Jang Ha-bin's guardian?

618
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:03,631
Of course.

619
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:05,341
He's a police officer too.

620
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:07,844
I see.

621
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:12,306
Was the person who got the documents about
Song Min-a a few days ago Jang--

622
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:13,683
Captain Jang Tae-su.

623
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,019
I see.

624
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,104
Yes.

625
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:21,315
SONG MIN-A, PARK JI-YEON
GUARDIAN: JUNG CHAN-HO

626
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:22,900
JANG HA-BIN
GUARDIAN: JANG TAE-SU

627
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:25,778
Yes, we're waiting to get
Song Min-a's record.

628
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:29,198
Yes. See you soon.

629
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:32,869
Did you get the document?

630
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:34,287
Yes, I put it here.

631
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:36,873
So who came to ask about Song Min-a?

632
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:40,877
The detectives.

633
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:42,920
I see.

634
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,095
Come on. Get in the car.

635
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:52,263
Sorry.

636
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:42,897
Ha-jun, let's go.

637
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,734
Ha-jun,
that's enough bike riding for today.

638
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:49,028
Go to your mom.

639
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:52,698
All right. Let's go.

640
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,328
Did you load everything, honey?

641
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:04,460
Put the seat belt on.

642
01:06:07,254 --> 01:06:09,048
-You can put them here.
-Catch!

643
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:12,927
Mom, we're going to go play there.

644
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:14,011
Sure.

645
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,683
Don't go too far away, Ha-bin.

646
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:20,184
Take care of your brother.

647
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,608
Let's play hide-and-seek.

648
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:30,611
Okay.

649
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,199
Count to ten.

650
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:36,951
Okay.

651
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:41,706
One, two, three,

652
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:44,709
four, five,

653
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:47,628
six, seven,

654
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:51,340
eight, nine, ten.

655
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:53,426
Are you done?

656
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,012
I'll start looking now.

657
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:42,118
Sir, do you think this is your son's?

658
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,913
It was buried in the ground.

659
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:17,231
Song Min-a.

660
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:29,743
Did you kill Song Min-a?

661
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:42,548
Answer me.

662
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:48,429
Do you think Ha-jun…

663
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:55,811
really died by accident?

664
01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:02,109
What?

665
01:12:16,206 --> 01:12:17,082
What about Mom?

666
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:24,423
Do you really think…

667
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:27,718
Mom killed herself?

668
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:49,716
If my dad was a profiler,
I would've felt so suffocated.

669
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:51,718
There's an upside too.

670
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:55,556
It makes you a better liar.

671
01:13:56,181 --> 01:14:00,102
Whenever this girl called her,
Su-hyeon would go out, no matter the time.

672
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:02,062
She'd seem out of her mind.

673
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:04,690
And I hope you catch the real culprit.

674
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:08,944
Are you always pushy like this?

675
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:10,946
This is a clear breach
of the investigative protocol.

676
01:14:11,029 --> 01:14:13,699
From this moment on, you need
to step away from the investigation.

677
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:14,783
Captain Jang.

678
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:19,872
