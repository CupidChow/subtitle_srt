1
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:44,753
Why did you meet Mom…

2
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,339
on the day she died?

3
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:51,718
I know…

4
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,263
you were with her that day.

5
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,477
Did you think you could keep it a secret?

6
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:19,996
Do you want to die?

7
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,918
If you want to die so badly,

8
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:27,796
why don't you just die?

9
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,589
What's wrong?

10
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:31,883
Can't you do it?

11
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,285
What if I did?

12
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,413
What?

13
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,543
Does it matter now?

14
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,548
What did you talk about with Mom that day?

15
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,344
I have nothing to say.

16
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:20,140
You were the last person
to see her before she died.

17
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,811
She must've acted differently.

18
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,275
Why can't you say anything?

19
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:33,444
I told you. I have nothing to say.

20
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,575
So you're not going to tell me.

21
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,743
Jang Ha-bin. Jang Ha-bin.

22
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,165
Where are you going this time?

23
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,712
I'll take care of it.

24
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:57,468
I'm going to figure out
what happened to your mom.

25
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,639
So please just wait.

26
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,530
I thought you drove him home.

27
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,366
He just left without me.

28
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,985
-Found anything about Choi's whereabouts?
-No.

29
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:40,321
I have no idea
how he left that fishing spot.

30
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,074
What was his last location again?

31
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:46,119
It's near Deoksin-dong again.

32
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,412
What if we find him?

33
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,581
Pardon?

34
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,917
If we find him, will that change anything?

35
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,171
Well, we can't just let him go.

36
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,883
Let's say we catch him.
Got any evidence of his crime?

37
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,637
We will catch him first
and then we will investigate--

38
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,473
Choi Yeong-min, that bastard,
will never make a confession.

39
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,810
Is it that hard for you to figure out
what he's like?

40
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,104
Captain Jang, that's a bit harsh.

41
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,356
-We're doing our best to--
-Detective Kim.

42
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:23,406
So what are you trying to say?

43
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:27,952
I'm saying
we need to find the evidence first.

44
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,287
You think I don't know that?

45
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,206
We just can't find the evidence.

46
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,878
Ms. Kim, we have a search and seizure
warrant for this property.

47
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,254
Please cooperate.

48
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,466
-Take the kids' phones first.
-Yes, sir.

49
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,301
-Do you have the container?
-Yes.

50
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,470
-Take everything.
-Yes, sir.

51
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,597
Can we go in now?

52
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,266
No, please wait for now.
We need to search the house first.

53
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:51,350
Stand by for now.

54
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,437
-Stop complaining.
-Fine.

55
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,980
This is an invasion of privacy.

56
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,148
Hurry up.

57
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,275
Aren't there seven kids?
Why's one missing?

58
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,401
Quiet.

59
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,033
There's one in here.

60
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,202
What are you doing in there?

61
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,205
Come out now!

62
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,208
Come out, you bastard!

63
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,461
If you don't come out,
I'll break down the door.

64
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,507
Geez, I was using the bathroom.

65
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,092
Shut it and give me your phone.

66
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,177
Fine. Here.

67
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,638
-How dare you… Hello.
-Hello.

68
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,598
You follow me, and you check the rooms.

69
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,724
Yes, sir.

70
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,321
Lift fingerprints off of everything

71
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,615
they could have touched,
like the faucet and sink.

72
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,699
Yes, sir.

73
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,546
-Please put the written evidence in here.
-Okay.

74
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,386
-Shall we start from here?
-Sure.

75
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,014
Take all the documentary evidence.

76
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,476
Photos, scribbles, letters and even trash.
Everything they left.

77
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:27,530
If we put a screwdriver here
and hit it with a hammer, we can open it.

78
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,614
What do you think?

79
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,039
Hold this.

80
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,127
It opened.

81
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:42,920
-Good job.
-No problem.

82
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,339
It's disassembled. Yes.

83
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,925
-Good job.
-No problem.

84
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,235
What's this?

85
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,783
It looks like he had it for a while.

86
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,829
This is surprising.

87
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,209
I didn't think
Choi Yeong-min was the kind of person

88
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:24,629
who could take care of
or share emotions with something.

89
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:25,796
Me neither.

90
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,778
The bloodstain suggests

91
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,281
that he probably locked the kids up here.

92
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:18,743
I understand they're kids with nowhere
to go, but I still don't get it.

93
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:24,373
Maybe there's another reason
why the kids can't leave the gang.

94
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,420
I want you two to go back to the office
and check the records.

95
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,713
Yes, sir.

96
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,257
I want to inspect the scene further.

97
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,469
We don't have time.

98
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,095
Please just do as I say.

99
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,305
Yes, sir.

100
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,350
Shall we go?

101
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,943
Motorcycle up front,
pull over immediately.

102
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,488
Motorcycle up front,
pull over immediately.

103
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,033
Motorcycle up front,
pull over immediately.

104
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,719
We have received a report
of a suspected drunk-driving motorcyclist.

105
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,097
Take off your helmet.

106
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,031
Take off your helmet.

107
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:28,289
We'll check your alcohol level.
Please take off your helmet.

108
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,764
Do you know me?

109
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,435
Why do you keep following me?

110
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,857
Well, what's your relationship
with Choi Yeong-min?

111
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,486
If you want my answer,
answer my question first.

112
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,786
I'm looking for someone.

113
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,125
The person who killed my daughter.

114
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,295
Song Min-a.

115
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,759
You know Min-a, don't you?

116
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,850
She didn't have a dad. She was an orphan.

117
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,312
I don't care if you believe me.

118
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,524
I don't want to explain
why I wasn't a good father.

119
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,528
How do you know Choi Yeong-min?

120
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,157
And what's your dad's deal with him?

121
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,368
What do you mean?

122
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:32,830
Your dad released that jerk
behind the other cops' backs.

123
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,750
Why are you chasing Choi Yeong-min

124
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,545
and why does your dad keep letting him go?

125
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,298
What on earth is your deal?

126
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,552
Are you serious?

127
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,848
Thanks for the bathroom.

128
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,767
Can I have a glass of water?

129
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:54,852
Sure.

130
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:10,951
It looks like you like cooking.

131
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,248
I just cook for my kid.

132
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,042
Here.

133
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,505
Do you bring food to the basement too?

134
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,091
Pardon?

135
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,595
I saw a lot of side dishes
in the basement.

136
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,435
There were no kitchen appliances there…

137
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,606
so I don't think
the kids made them themselves.

138
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,944
We live in the same house,

139
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,113
so I help them sometimes.

140
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:51,992
But you told me you haven't met them,

141
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,120
including Lee Su-hyeon.

142
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,336
Yeong-min reached out to you, right?

143
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,966
Why would he reach out to me?

144
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,728
Thanks for the water.

145
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:51,927
CHOI YEONG-MIN

146
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,152
Fucking bitch.

147
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,429
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

148
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,556
Your call has been forwarded
to their voicemail.

149
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,391
Call charges will apply after the beep.

150
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,684
KO SE-HO

151
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,691
I don't think
we're here to be interrogated.

152
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,070
I think so too.
No one's coming in or asking us anything.

153
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,154
What if we--

154
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,906
Shut it, you bitches.

155
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,034
I'm having a headache here.

156
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,286
I'm just worried.

157
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,706
Do you think we'll be all right?

158
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,377
-A painkiller. A strong one.
-Painkiller?

159
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:19,306
Take one pill every six hours.

160
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,474
Here's your change.

161
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,264
Who are you? Do you know me?

162
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:04,518
Listen. The cops ransacked your house
and took all the kids.

163
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,397
I'm saying you're in a worse situation

164
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,690
than you think.

165
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,192
Why are you telling me that?

166
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,739
Shut it and answer me
if you don't want more trouble.

167
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,324
Song Min-a…

168
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,119
Who killed her?

169
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,121
Was it you?

170
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,168
It wasn't me.

171
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,752
Do you know who killed her?

172
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,882
You saw her that day

173
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,842
at the mountain.

174
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,511
It's Jang Ha-bin.

175
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,723
That bitch killed Song Min-a.

176
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,918
JI-SU

177
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:20,594
JI-SU

178
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:21,803
Why did you meet Mom…

179
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,513
on the day she died?

180
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:28,810
I know you were with her that day.

181
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,147
It was my mistake.

182
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,566
It was a mistake!

183
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,218
How may I help you?

184
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:02,970
Hello. I…

185
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,846
Officer Lee?

186
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,431
Do you work here?

187
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,016
Yes, I was just transferred here.

188
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,977
I'm in the Women and Juvenile
Affairs Division here.

189
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,353
I had no idea.

190
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,813
What brings you here today?

191
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:16,066
I need to talk to Captain Jang Tae-su.
Did he go somewhere?

192
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,568
Yes. I'm not sure when he'll be back.

193
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,862
May I ask what it's about?

194
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,156
I just have something to ask him.

195
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,326
It's so nice to see you here.

196
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,371
I'll let you know when he comes back.

197
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,539
That'd be great. Thanks.

198
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:32,916
What?

199
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,548
Do you know Officer Gu?

200
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,758
-Officer?
-Yes.

201
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,219
He became a police officer?

202
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,057
How do you know him?

203
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,476
Well… I just know him.

204
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,230
Let's keep in touch and grab coffee soon.

205
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,315
Okay.

206
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,734
Bye.

207
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,123
Eun-jin.

208
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,791
Are you feeling better?

209
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,160
I looked through Eun-jin's diary.

210
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:54,206
It looks like she was harassed by Choi

211
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,042
for cooperating with us
during the last interrogation.

212
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,504
I should've been more careful.

213
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,380
Anything else?

214
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,634
Eun-jin…

215
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:10,514
It seems like she has been
repeatedly abused by his stepfather.

216
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:14,059
And her mother turned a blind eye to it,
knowing everything.

217
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:18,855
Eun-jin must have been hurt deeply.

218
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:27,030
The kids are still
in the same room, right?

219
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,535
Do you know
where Choi Yeong-min is right now?

220
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,579
I don't.

221
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,706
Or anyone who might know?

222
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:44,840
What's the relationship
between him and the owner of the house?

223
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:49,719
I know she frequents the basement.

224
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,682
She has nothing to do with Yeong-min.

225
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,436
She takes care of us,

226
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,439
and that's because she's a nice person.

227
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,779
We'll take a short break.

228
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,157
Pause the recording.

229
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,996
I think you should go back home.

230
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,041
What? Why?

231
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,335
Your family has reported you missing.

232
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:28,341
According to the rules, once I report,
you'll be sent home immediately.

233
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:34,139
What's wrong? Do you not want to go home?

234
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,227
Can you please turn a blind eye
just this once?

235
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:44,691
Well, there must be a reason
why you ran away from home.

236
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,030
And it'll repeat once you're back home.

237
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:54,451
Please don't tell my family about me.

238
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,828
Please.

239
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,426
We'll continue the interrogation.

240
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,807
What was the relationship
between Choi and the owner of the house?

241
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,232
Eun-jin.

242
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,195
I often

243
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,031
saw them together.

244
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,407
Are they dating?

245
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,993
It's not like that.

246
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,830
You sound sure about it.

247
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,540
How do you know?

248
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:48,755
She's dating someone else.

249
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,010
And Yeong-min flipped out
when he found out about it.

250
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,314
Is it this man?

251
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,990
I really don't want to get
Ms. Kim in trouble.

252
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:18,535
Right now,
you should worry more about yourself.

253
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,620
Look.

254
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,789
This is the man, right?

255
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,805
Yes, it's him.

256
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,114
Is this why you asked me about her diary?

257
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,123
So you could find her soft spot
and blackmail her?

258
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,085
Nobody has reported her missing.

259
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,006
So you lied.

260
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,132
So what?

261
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,594
Did it harm anyone?

262
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:21,348
You used her wounds and pressured her

263
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,517
with something that isn't even true.

264
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,401
Captain, I didn't know you were

265
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,279
this kind of person.

266
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,786
What did you think you knew about me?

267
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:57,801
DON'T SKIP YOUR MEALS, CAPTAIN
GU DAE-HONG

268
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,897
She just left to pick up her kid.

269
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,191
I'll go look around this area.

270
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,527
I'll wait here then.

271
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,153
-Thanks.
-Sure.

272
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,613
I'll come with you.

273
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:37,590
Why won't you answer it?

274
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,076
This isn't
your first time stealing, right?

275
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,495
You didn't hesitate.

276
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,665
Did you see your mom?

277
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:12,917
She went to pick you up.

278
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,509
Are you going to tell my mom about this?

279
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,053
Of course I am.

280
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,431
I will never do it again.

281
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:31,394
Could you please
not tell my mom about this?

282
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,229
Well…

283
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,280
Have you…

284
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,409
seen this man?

285
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,373
Have you seen your mom and this man--

286
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,209
Officer Lee. Excuse me for a second.

287
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,211
Do-yun, come here.

288
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,463
-Officer Gu.
-It's okay.

289
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:01,341
You can't do this
without his guardian's consent.

290
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:07,388
It's quite late
and the house seems empty right now,

291
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,433
so why don't you come
apologize to them tomorrow?

292
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,894
-Okay.
-Get home safely.

293
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,021
It's okay.

294
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,774
Good night.

295
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,487
What was that?

296
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,615
We're here to work.

297
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:28,952
Which is to investigate Seong-hui,
not a scared child.

298
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:35,583
From now on, let's be careful
not to cross the line at work.

299
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,168
Why do you keep getting emotional?

300
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,003
Some things are more important
than investigations.

301
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:42,048
-Are you seriously saying that as a cop?
-Cops are humans too.

302
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,801
And so are those who get investigated.

303
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,305
I just want us to be…

304
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,395
more human.

305
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,105
Be a good cop if you want.

306
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,358
I'll be a bad cop.

307
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,653
Working with you is…

308
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,449
seriously exhausting.

309
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,218
I heard the cops ransacked the house.

310
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,097
Tell me…

311
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,976
why do people think I'm a murderer?

312
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:39,355
Just stay low for now, and the cops--

313
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,481
Damn it.

314
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:47,906
Enough with the bullshit.

315
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,452
I'll ask you one last time.

316
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,746
So be honest with me.

317
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,208
Who killed Lee Su-hyeon?

318
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,007
You said you saw that lady killing her.

319
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,012
It turned out she didn't.

320
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,933
She just buried the body,
thinking her daughter had killed her.

321
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,144
It's Park Jun-tae, isn't it?

322
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,230
That bastard killed her.

323
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:26,194
That day, the cops didn't come
to the fishing spot to get me.

324
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,112
They couldn't have
tracked me down that fast.

325
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,410
The police are investigating
Park Jun-tae now, right?

326
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,581
I don't know.

327
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,250
You fucking bitch!

328
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,047
You…

329
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,842
Did you enjoy using me
to cover for that bastard?

330
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,971
I was being called and chased
by the police, completely clueless.

331
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,516
I was even planning to flee with you,

332
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,268
and meanwhile, you two were…

333
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,023
It must've been hilarious watching me.

334
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,068
Yeong-min…

335
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,539
I can't go down alone like this.

336
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,002
I can't give that to you.

337
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,674
Where's Park Jun-tae, that son of a bitch?

338
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,142
Can I have a second?

339
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,226
Sure.

340
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,421
Let's go inside.

341
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:12,175
I don't think I can do this today.
Something came up.

342
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,971
It won't take long.
Why don't you leave after this?

343
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,099
This is voluntary.

344
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,643
You can't force me to do it.

345
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,898
I'm going to head out then.

346
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,066
If you leave like this,

347
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:32,111
it'll make you seem more suspicious.
You know that, right?

348
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,742
Yes, I do.

349
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,790
Wait.

350
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:47,043
It won't take long.
Can't you stay just for a bit?

351
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,336
Sir!

352
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:55,760
You said you knew Officer Gu, right?

353
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,429
Do-yun.

354
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:01,307
No matter how hungry you get,
promise me you won't do it again.

355
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,562
You know what you did was bad, right?

356
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:09,690
Yes.

357
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,319
Your mom is running late.

358
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:17,782
-Don't wait for her and go to bed.
-Excuse me, sir.

359
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,075
Yes?

360
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,663
Can we eat this together?

361
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:26,415
That sounds great.

362
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:31,129
I've seen him a few times
while I was investigating his brother.

363
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,382
What happened?

364
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,552
His brother was
under investigation for a rape case,

365
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,387
and he took his own life.

366
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:45,268
The detective on that case
was notoriously tenacious.

367
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,855
He kept following him around
for the investigation,

368
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:52,525
which led to rumors at his workplace
and eventually resulted in his divorce.

369
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,069
He must've felt wronged.

370
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:01,367
After his death,
the real culprit was caught.

371
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,328
Why did they push him so hard
in the investigation?

372
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,413
Well…

373
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,919
At first, Officer Gu gave us
an alibi for his brother.

374
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,799
Then later, he confessed
that he wasn't with him.

375
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,052
And we found it suspicious.

376
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,263
Because he gave us a false alibi at first,

377
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,223
we pushed him extra hard.

378
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,767
Later, Officer Gu came to our office

379
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,020
and cried his eyes out.

380
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,439
It even made me tear up.

381
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,317
After all, his brother was innocent.

382
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,321
He must have regretted

383
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:41,115
not lying for him.

384
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,709
We've got so many different things.
Which one do you want?

385
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:53,961
-This one.
-This one?

386
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,633
Here.

387
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,764
Have some milk too.

388
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,436
What did you get?

389
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,648
It's Sham Sham Dragon.

390
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,316
Hang on.

391
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,906
Do you want this?

392
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:25,034
Wow, this is my favorite character.

393
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,118
Do you like him too?

394
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,328
Yes.

395
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:31,457
My nephew used to love it too
when he was your age.

396
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:35,628
He's so lucky to have an uncle like you.

397
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,258
I hope he thinks so.

398
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:45,846
The uncle living in the basement
is a really bad man.

399
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,394
He hit my mom and the girls.

400
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:56,816
Do-yun,
I will find him and teach him a lesson.

401
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,693
By the way…

402
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:04,282
Why did you ask me about that man?

403
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,574
Which man?

404
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,120
Mr. Park Jun-tae, the teacher?

405
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,206
Is he a bad man too?

406
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,677
Seong-hui!

407
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:31,225
-Seong-hui, are you okay?
-Jun-tae…

408
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,435
You didn't get hurt, right?

409
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,021
What happened?

410
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,397
Stop putting on a show.

411
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,483
You murderer.

412
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,283
I'm not here to hear your nonsense.

413
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,578
Leave Seong-hui alone.

414
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,038
So you're going to play dumb?

415
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:58,002
I guess
I can tell the police everything then.

416
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,587
Suit yourself.

417
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,465
I'm not sure if they'll believe you.

418
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,301
You son of a bitch.

419
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:10,056
Do you think I can't do it?

420
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,058
Go ahead.

421
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,602
Go ahead and tell them.

422
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,357
Do you even have any evidence?

423
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:25,237
Will the police believe a thug like you…

424
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,574
or me?

425
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:38,000
Just run away
and lay low for the rest of your life.

426
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,880
You son of a bitch!

427
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,259
Goddamn it.

428
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:59,146
-This fucking…
-Yeong-min! Stop!

429
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,606
Please.

430
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,068
Please don't do this.

431
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,493
Jun-tae.

432
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,496
Oh, my gosh. What do I do?

433
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:18,165
Jun-tae, are you okay?

434
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,347
Fuck.

435
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,456
JI-SU: WHY DID YOU
RELEASE CHOI YEONG-MIN?

436
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,214
Where are you?

437
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,758
Did you meet Choi Yeong-min?

438
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,275
Let's meet. I'll tell you everything.

439
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,738
Where are you now?

440
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,406
We went to an amusement park together.

441
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,699
And…

442
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:37,453
Anyway, he seemed like a good person.

443
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:41,123
Mom laughs a lot when she's with him.

444
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:48,631
I think one of the girls in the basement
likes him too.

445
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,719
Did Su-hyeon say that?

446
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:54,970
No.

447
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,598
Min-a said that.

448
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:08,067
So Min-a and Mr. Park knew each other.

449
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:13,322
Do you remember
Park Jun-tae visiting the house that day?

450
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,533
On May 11th.

451
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,164
Yes.

452
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,291
It's the day Song Min-a died.

453
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,549
This is the car Song Min-a rented.

454
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:35,386
Park Jun-tae met
Song Min-a that day, right?

455
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,603
How did you come here?
What about the interview?

456
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:56,907
Who is it?

457
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:59,118
The police?

458
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:01,829
Nobody. Don't worry about it.

459
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,501
I'll take a taxi.
There are cops around the house.

460
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,296
-I'll drop you off near the house.
-We should be careful.

461
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,340
I'll call you when I get home.

462
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,130
Ha-bin.

463
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,714
Ha-bin!

464
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,050
Ha-bin, wake up.

465
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,176
Ha-bin.

466
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:23,220
Ha-bin.

467
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:28,851
Ha-bin.

468
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,089
Honey.

469
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,591
Honey.

470
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:42,799
What are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

471
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:49,473
What if…

472
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,603
you were right?

473
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,105
What?

474
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:00,943
What if Ha-jun was…

475
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,323
really…

476
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,537
killed by Ha-bin?

477
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,999
Is that why you're doing this?

478
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,797
Have you always had that thought
while raising Ha-bin?

479
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,968
I told you back then. It was my mistake.

480
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:27,469
It was a mistake!

481
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,516
You're not in your right mind now.

482
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,727
I'll take Ha-bin.

483
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,255
Do you really want to die?

484
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,551
I can't take this anymore.

485
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,680
If you want to die so badly,

486
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:14,224
die alone.

487
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,059
What's wrong?

488
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,394
Can't you do it?

489
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:21,106
Ha-bin doesn't need you anymore.

490
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:24,109
She has me.

491
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:36,538
Are you sure?

492
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:42,002
Do you think
Ha-bin will be fine if you're gone?

493
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,049
Without you, Ha-bin will be all alone.

494
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:48,592
She'll be an orphan.

495
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,594
Are you okay with that?

496
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,265
Do you think…

497
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:58,977
Ha-bin will rely on me?

498
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,981
To her, I'm just a stranger.

499
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:12,949
I must have lost my mind.

500
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,161
I must have completely lost my mind.

501
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,544
Please don't tell Ha-bin…

502
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:28,340
about what happened today.

503
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,260
I won't tell her.

504
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,230
Why aren't you saying anything?

505
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,403
What are you hiding from me?

506
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,577
Why did you release Choi Yeong-min?

507
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:03,458
What's wrong?

508
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:08,213
Does Choi Yeong-min have something on you?

509
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:18,390
If I tell you, will you stop?

510
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,854
Will you just stay still?

511
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:28,108
Answer me.

512
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,531
Lee Su-hyeon…

513
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:38,076
was killed by your mom.

514
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,247
That's why I released Choi Yeong-min.

515
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,541
I wanted to cover it up.

516
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,168
You're lying.

517
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,463
Mom would never do that.

518
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:56,803
Tell me the truth.

519
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:00,182
It's the truth.

520
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:09,691
Did she really kill her?

521
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:12,736
Yes.

522
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,197
Your mom killed Lee Su-hyeon.

523
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,117
So stop all this now.

524
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:29,377
About the day Mom died…

525
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:34,257
Why did you hide it from me?

526
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:41,932
If you want to convince me,
tell me everything.

527
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:43,975
Every single thing.

528
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:49,439
If I had said I met her before she died…

529
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,862
I would have been called in
for an interrogation and such, obviously.

530
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,867
I was about to get a promotion then.

531
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:06,164
To be honest,
I didn't want her to get in the way of it.

532
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,086
That's why I hid it.

533
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:17,342
Are you happy now?

534
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:35,981
He's in that building.

535
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,406
Why are you helping me?

536
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,660
You helped me at the mountain too.

537
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:52,622
You don't know me.

538
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:55,917
I do.

539
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:00,797
You and I have…

540
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,716
the same goal.

541
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:35,540
Is this the police?

542
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,046
I have an urgent tip to report,

543
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,215
but I don't know the detective's number.

544
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:49,304
It's Jang Tae-su.

545
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,045
It's me.

546
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,382
Let's meet.
I'll tell you everything I know.

547
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:30,220
What are you trying to pull now?

548
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:34,349
I'm innocent. I didn't kill her.

549
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:36,768
I can serve a few years
for extortion or whatever.

550
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:43,191
Just make sure my money is safe.

551
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:49,114
Where are you right now?

552
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:21,062
Where is Choi Yeong-min right now?

553
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:23,398
How would I know?

554
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:28,278
You can be charged with perjury, you know.

555
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:31,698
Think carefully.

556
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,868
It's only a matter of time
until we catch him.

557
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,120
Do you think he'll protect you then?

558
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:42,709
I just…

559
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,462
I just did as he said.

560
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:48,256
All I did was put the painkiller there.

561
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:50,884
Where?

562
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,220
Where did he tell you to put it?

563
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:29,964
Did my mom really kill Lee Su-hyeon?

564
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:32,050
You…

565
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:34,719
What do you think you're doing?

566
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:37,305
Untie me, you fucking…

567
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:42,936
Did my mom really kill her?

568
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:50,527
You crazy bitch.

569
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:53,196
Fuck! All right!

570
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,031
No!

571
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:57,867
No, she didn't!

572
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:03,206
No.

573
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:06,626
Your mom didn't fucking kill her!

574
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:11,589
Then who was it?

575
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,008
Why did she bury the body?

576
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:17,929
Do you really want to know?

577
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:22,392
Tell me, or I'll kill you.

578
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:29,816
It's because of you.

579
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:34,988
You were the reason.

580
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:40,493
Your mom thought you killed her
and that's why she buried the body.

581
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:46,916
Why? Is it so hard to believe?

582
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,003
Then why don't you go ask your dad?

583
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:59,137
You know what?

584
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,432
Look at yourself now.

585
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,268
Who wouldn't suspect you?

586
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:25,830
What are you talking about?

587
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:27,540
I told your daughter everything.

588
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,292
She was actually going to kill me--

589
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:30,543
Where are you right now?

590
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:20,218
You…

591
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:22,970
What are you doing here?

592
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:24,764
You should leave.

593
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:25,890
Please…

594
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:29,268
Please stop now.

595
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:36,609
Just don't do anything.

596
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:25,783
Snap out of it.

597
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:27,493
Look at me.

598
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:35,001
I told you. You didn't do anything.

599
01:02:39,797 --> 01:02:42,717
Parents know their children.

600
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:46,679
You…

601
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:50,099
didn't do it.

602
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:51,809
That doesn't change anything.

603
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:52,894
No.

604
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:56,022
Nothing happened,
and you don't know anything.

605
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:00,109
Dad.

606
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:06,365
Don't worry. I have plans.

607
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:37,897
Please don't tell Ha-bin…

608
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,108
about what happened today.

609
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:43,903
I won't tell her.

610
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:46,531
Please don't tell her.

611
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:49,075
Please.

612
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:29,782
Always move in pairs
in case something comes up.

613
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,200
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

614
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:33,703
Team Three, check the entrance.
Team Two, follow me.

615
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:35,830
-Stay alert.
-Yes, sir.

616
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:37,748
Listen.

617
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,751
He's a sly one, so move quietly.

618
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:42,587
-Understood?
-Yes, sir.

619
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:44,130
We will catch him tonight.

620
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,799
-Turn down the radio volume.
-Yes, sir.

621
01:05:07,778 --> 01:05:10,364
-Let's check here first. This way.
-Yes, sir.

622
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:11,824
-Search everywhere.
-Yes, sir.

623
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:22,700
Was someone else there?

624
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:25,202
Are you pretending to trust me

625
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:26,328
to get me to confess?

626
01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:30,124
So about that necklace found at the scene…

627
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:32,710
It looks like the culprit
could be a woman.

628
01:09:32,793 --> 01:09:35,462
We need to investigate Jang Ha-bin.

629
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:38,340
Mom. Where have you been?

630
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:40,634
Ms. Kim, you are under arrest
on suspicion of the murder of Choi.

631
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:43,053
-It's a misunderstanding.
-Detective Cho and Kim…

632
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:44,555
Park Jun-tae turned himself in?

633
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:46,640
He even brought a knife,
saying that he killed him.

634
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:48,267
I saw Ha-bin there.

635
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:55,107
