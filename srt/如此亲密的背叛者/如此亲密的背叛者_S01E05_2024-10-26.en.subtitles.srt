1
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,545
This is crazy.

2
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:05,935
How does it feel?

3
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,981
To see your mom kill someone.

4
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,614
I warned you

5
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,283
that you'd regret it.

6
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,161
Why would my mom kill Su-hyeon?

7
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,079
That's none of my business.

8
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,084
Now, give me my money back.

9
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,754
-Why would my mom kill Su-hyeon?
-You little…

10
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,135
You fucking bitch.

11
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,013
This…

12
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,809
Were you going to kill me?

13
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,230
Is murder genetic?

14
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,316
Go on.

15
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,487
Go on.

16
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,949
Go on and kill me, you crazy bitch.

17
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,875
Damn it.

18
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,967
What the fuck? Who are you?

19
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,302
This fucker.

20
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,434
You son of a bitch! Who the fuck are you?

21
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,270
Tell me!

22
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,773
You fucker.

23
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,141
God damn it.

24
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,083
Both numbers are registered
under someone named Yoon Ji-su.

25
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,036
How long will it take?

26
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,454
It'll take a while.

27
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,414
Please make it quick.

28
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,078
Did you locate Choi Yeong-min?

29
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:38,499
Not yet. We're checking the footage
to find the license plate number.

30
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,627
-By the way, where are you--
-Let me know when you find it.

31
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,932
JI-SU
VIDEO

32
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:41,604
INCOMING CALL: JI-SU

33
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,406
Did you know?

34
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:58,454
What… What is this?

35
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,748
Why did Su-hyeon die?

36
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:05,545
Why did Ji-su… I mean, your mom…

37
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,963
Tell me. How did Su-hyeon die?

38
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:11,425
Where… Where did you get this?

39
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,718
Answer me!

40
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,012
What's the cause of her death?

41
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,307
We've got nothing yet.

42
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,522
Ha-bin, where are you now?

43
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,940
Where are you right now?

44
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,812
Did you show that video to her?

45
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,481
Why? For what?

46
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,026
She wouldn't quit snooping around.

47
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,902
She's going to stay quiet now.

48
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:12,862
Still, how could you--

49
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,574
You really think
that's the fucking problem right now?

50
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,785
She tried to kill me.

51
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,371
And some bastard is chasing me!

52
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,178
You know what?

53
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,431
Now that I think about it, it's weird.

54
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,642
What do you mean?

55
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,187
That bastard in the helmet.

56
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,815
Jang Ha-bin
didn't seem to know him either.

57
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,986
You're the only person I told that I was

58
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,280
going to the mountain.

59
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,622
What's wrong? Feeling guilty?

60
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:06,916
No.

61
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,669
That's nonsense.

62
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:12,713
Sell the house first.

63
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:15,591
What?

64
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,176
Get ready to leave.

65
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,763
We planned to leave once we got the money.

66
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,025
By the way,

67
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,445
did you not see his face at all?

68
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,948
I think it's someone I know.

69
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:42,993
Why?

70
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,872
Do you have someone in mind?

71
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,500
I don't fucking know.

72
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,420
Just my gut feeling.

73
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,142
PHOTOS

74
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:15,484
SEONG-HUI

75
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,288
The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable

76
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,332
and your call has been forwarded
to their voicemail.

77
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,709
Call charges will apply after the beep.

78
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,078
Mr. Park is not here today.

79
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,288
He's on sick leave.

80
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,250
He requested the leave this morning,

81
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,877
so it must be pretty bad.

82
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,545
-This morning?
-Yes.

83
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:41,672
Thank you.

84
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,383
It's strange that
he asked for the sick leave this morning.

85
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,344
It means he contacted the school

86
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,179
while ignoring our calls.

87
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,264
Exactly.

88
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,100
There's a chance he's actually sick,

89
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,353
but his routine changed
as soon as we started the investigation.

90
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,814
It bothers me.

91
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,405
What's wrong?

92
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:07,907
What is it?

93
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,161
Go ahead without me.
I have something to check.

94
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:16,790
-What is it? I'll come with you.
-No, please wait in the car.

95
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,006
She's absent without notice?

96
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,341
Yes.

97
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,843
I called her dad, but he didn't answer.

98
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,888
Why are you asking about Ha-bin?

99
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,642
I just wanted to meet her.

100
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,148
RECENT

101
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,824
I found that
the phone has a GPS tracking app.

102
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,619
What?

103
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:57,915
Can you see who downloaded the app?

104
00:15:58,707 --> 00:15:59,708
Of course.

105
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,254
This app is usually for couples,
so the users are linked to one another.

106
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,507
Hold on a second.

107
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,427
The number is saved in the contact. Here.

108
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:16,976
THE OTHER PARTY
HA-BIN'S MOM

109
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:29,071
So with this app,
you can also track the other phone?

110
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,155
Of course.

111
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:45,337
HA-BIN'S MOM

112
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,053
SEONKYEONG BUILDING

113
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,323
-May I ask you a question?
-Sure.

114
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,783
Have you seen this girl?

115
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,869
Have you seen this girl?

116
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,358
Excuse me.

117
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,694
Have you seen this girl?

118
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,197
Yes. She was here just now.

119
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,669
Excuse me.

120
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,671
She's actually my daughter.

121
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,299
What was she here for?

122
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,878
SLIDE TO POWER OFF

123
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,319
The consultation record?

124
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,406
Ms. Yoon Ji-su had been seeing me
for a while for depression.

125
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,283
And Ha-bin wanted to see her record.

126
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,410
KIM KYEONG MI

127
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,749
Can I see the record too?

128
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,880
I don't know if you heard,

129
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,757
but last year, my wife--

130
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:36,758
I will.

131
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,681
Actually,
I was expecting you to visit someday.

132
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,641
Pardon?

133
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,924
Can you make a right turn here, sir?

134
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,945
I want to change my destination.

135
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,325
I have some sessions recorded
with her consent.

136
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,036
I can send them all to you.

137
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:52,167
NO SIGNAL
HA-BIN'S MOM

138
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,840
It might be hard for you
to listen to it, though.

139
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,387
He's not picking up.

140
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,848
-So you haven't seen him since last night?
-Yes.

141
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,851
-He didn't tell anyone where he was going?
-Not really.

142
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,939
When Captain Jang calls back,
tell him to call me.

143
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:14,856
Will do.

144
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,733
-Two hundred eighty.
-Captain.

145
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,319
Did you find anything?

146
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:20,988
Yes.

147
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,282
We found three different footprints.

148
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,951
One of them matches
Choi's foot size. It's 280 mm.

149
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,411
What about the rest?

150
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,706
One is 270 mm, which is likely a man's.

151
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,251
And the other one seems to be a woman's.
It's about 230 mm.

152
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:37,296
We also found
signs of scuffles here and there.

153
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,300
If there was a physical conflict,

154
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:44,511
it means the person likely had
an issue with Choi Yeong-min.

155
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,847
And there must have been a good reason

156
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,599
why he had to meet this person
while he was on the run.

157
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,311
-What about the runaway kids?
-I talked to Detective Park.

158
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,604
They never left the house
all day yesterday.

159
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,274
Who could it be?

160
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,775
I wonder

161
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,029
why they decided to meet here,
of all places.

162
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,866
We should focus on the location too.

163
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,784
This place holds significant meaning.

164
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,163
Only those involved
in the case know about it.

165
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,623
Is it possible

166
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:18,295
that everyone who met here
knew Lee Su-hyeon?

167
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,256
What do you mean?

168
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,217
You think Choi met his accomplices here?

169
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,011
I think it's a possibility.

170
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:30,182
So it's someone both Choi Yeong-min
and Lee Su-hyeon know,

171
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,809
but not a runaway.

172
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,485
Excuse me. I have to get this.

173
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,988
Hey, Detective Kim. Did you look into it?

174
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,657
Captain. Park Jun-tae left home
last night and never came back.

175
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,951
How does he look? Does he look sick?

176
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,788
Well, he looks fine in the video.

177
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,039
All right.

178
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:55,665
Bring the file over here.

179
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,250
-Yes, sir.
-And…

180
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,295
Wait.

181
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,465
Hold on a second.

182
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,846
Sir, have you seen this kid?

183
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,725
He made such a fuss
in the middle of the night.

184
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:18,355
I was wondering what this thug's deal was
with the nice teacher.

185
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,066
-Captain.
-I heard that.

186
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,569
So Choi Yeong-min
and Park Jun-tae know each other.

187
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,935
Who are you? Do you know me?

188
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,482
Why are you following me?

189
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,200
Take off your helmet.

190
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:46,067
YOON JI-SU'S
THERAPY SESSION RECORDS

191
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,237
DOWNLOADING FILE

192
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,322
FILE HAS BEEN SAVED

193
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,330
It's Su-hyeon. Lee Su-hyeon.

194
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,624
It's such a pretty name, right?

195
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,127
To me,

196
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,047
she's like a blessing.

197
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:10,217
She never brought any friends home.

198
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,427
Su-hyeon is Ha-bin's first friend.

199
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,972
Your efforts for Ha-bin are paying off.

200
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,683
You've done a great job.

201
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,185
I finally feel relieved.

202
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:24,022
My daughter can live a normal life now.

203
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,109
This feels like a reward

204
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,320
for all the effort I have put in.

205
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:50,840
What's with the feast?

206
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,009
Ha-bin.

207
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,347
How is it?

208
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,975
I think the galbijjim is salty.
Should I add more water?

209
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,518
What do you think?

210
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:02,686
I think it's okay.

211
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,064
She's here.

212
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,995
Happy birthday to you

213
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,831
Happy birthday to you

214
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:26,251
Happy birthday, dear Ha-bin

215
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:29,087
Happy birthday to you

216
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:37,846
Ha-bin.

217
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:39,514
Here.

218
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:41,766
It's nothing big, though.

219
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,157
I like it.

220
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:03,204
Su-hyeon, this is from me.

221
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,008
Oh, this is a bit too…

222
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,343
I don't need this.

223
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:20,889
Just take it. I asked her to get this
for you as my birthday gift.

224
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:25,602
-Hey.
-I want to call and text you, but I can't.

225
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:31,066
You can take it. I want you to take it.

226
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,070
Thank you.

227
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,203
How did you save my number?

228
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:44,746
Lee Su-hyeon.

229
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,623
What? That feels a bit too formal.

230
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,890
I'm home now. Are you home?

231
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:05,809
I'm not sure.

232
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,561
-Maybe in the afternoon?
-Back then, I didn't realize

233
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,272
that some presents

234
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,901
come at a price.

235
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,005
Where have you been this time?
Do you know what time it is?

236
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,590
What happened?

237
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:43,596
Why are you skipping cram school
and never answering my calls these days?

238
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:50,311
Should I ask Su-hyeon?

239
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,480
Will you tell me then?

240
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,481
Let go.

241
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,825
Do you know her?

242
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,452
Let me see.

243
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,621
-I don't know.
-No.

244
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,540
The number is 010-0450-7658.

245
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,001
Call me when you see her. I can give more.

246
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,670
The number is 010-0450-7658.

247
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,964
Call me when you see her.

248
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,642
-What's this?
-Call 010-0450-7658.

249
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:13,603
-Write that down.
-Call me when you see her.

250
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,322
Hello. Is it you, Su-hyeon?

251
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,868
If you know anything, please tell me.

252
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:33,248
I saw Ha-bin with some strange kids--

253
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,541
She's looking for me.

254
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,294
What do you mean?

255
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:43,091
She's looking for me because I've been
skipping school and ignoring her calls.

256
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,344
Why did you ignore her calls?

257
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,557
You know why.

258
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:55,854
Know what?

259
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,815
You knew everything…

260
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,193
and you didn't tell me.

261
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,779
About Ha-bin, I mean.

262
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,702
What are you talking about?

263
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,663
Ha-bin is…

264
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,667
not like others.

265
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,674
I can't quite explain…

266
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,094
but I'm scared…

267
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,681
You know what I'm talking about.

268
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,351
You know what I mean.

269
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,444
I'm scared of her.

270
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:50,742
Please help me.

271
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,663
You can do that much for me, right?

272
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,670
How do you want me…

273
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,342
to help you?

274
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:10,780
You've been looking for Su-hyeon, right?

275
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,117
How did you know?

276
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:18,037
Stop calling and looking for her.

277
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,415
You said I should make a friend.

278
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,668
You can't have a relationship
with someone who doesn't want one.

279
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,004
You can't just force her into it.

280
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,132
So stop it now.

281
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,136
No.

282
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,096
I will find her.

283
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,558
Okay, let's say you find her.

284
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,145
Then what?

285
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,030
Why are you shivering?

286
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,746
Are you worried I might do something?

287
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,124
Like I did to Ha-jun?

288
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,714
What are you saying…

289
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,009
You think I killed him, right?
Just like Dad.

290
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,179
What?

291
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,264
Be honest with me.

292
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,061
Has that never crossed your mind?

293
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,523
Not even once?

294
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,467
You haven't come to see me lately.

295
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,304
Something happened, right?

296
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,392
Ha-bin…

297
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,230
Ha-bin…

298
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,441
You can tell me everything.

299
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,486
Ha-bin…

300
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,536
Ha-bin…

301
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,541
I think Ha-bin killed a dog.

302
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:19,297
Are you saying she harmed an animal?

303
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,633
How did that happen?

304
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,220
I don't know.

305
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,599
When I found the dog, it was already dead.

306
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,769
But I couldn't ask her about it.

307
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,105
I just couldn't.

308
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,361
I buried the dog myself,

309
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,738
and I felt so bad.

310
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,785
Ji-su.

311
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,747
Let's take a deep breath.

312
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,460
It doesn't matter what happens to me.

313
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:58,627
But…

314
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,672
if Ha-bin does

315
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,508
something like this again,

316
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,178
then I don't know…

317
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:14,435
I don't know what to do.

318
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,605
I really don't.

319
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,540
You got it wrong.

320
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,919
You thought Ha-bin was the one
who killed her.

321
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:24,964
This is crazy.

322
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,184
This is crazy.

323
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:40,729
That's a good question.

324
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,857
I'm curious myself.

325
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,401
Why is your daughter so obsessed with me?

326
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,327
Where was Choi's last location?

327
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,580
-Near Deoksin-dong.
-Deoksin-dong.

328
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,999
Keep me posted about his movements.

329
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,333
-Yes, sir.
-Detective Kim.

330
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:04,128
What time did Park Jun-tae
leave his apartment?

331
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,588
Around 10:00 p.m. last night.

332
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,465
I did some calculations

333
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,341
and if he went straight to the mountain,

334
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,719
he should've arrived
when Choi got out of the taxi.

335
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,638
Then about the footprints…

336
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:15,639
Yes.

337
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,641
Where's Choi Yeong-min now?

338
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,270
What's this attitude?

339
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:24,690
Where was Choi last located?

340
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:27,693
Do you think I'm someone
who just gives you updates?

341
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:32,072
-Where have you been and--
-You two come to the meeting room.

342
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,910
-Hey!
-Captain.

343
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,119
Jang Tae-su.

344
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:41,415
Don't you see people pulling all-nighters?

345
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,292
If you're going to be like this, quit!

346
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:46,003
You've been ghosting us
without any explanation.

347
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,421
You're not a lead investigator.

348
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,923
-Hey.
-You're not leading anything!

349
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,383
-Move. I need to find Choi now.
-Let go.

350
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:54,011
-Move, you bastard!
-Captain!

351
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,471
-Captain!
-Please stop.

352
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,265
What's the matter?

353
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,559
Keep going.

354
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,687
Why argue
when you can just scuffle, right?

355
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,398
You can't catch the culprit,

356
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,359
so why not take it out on your colleague?

357
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:28,587
CHOI YEONG-MIN

358
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,679
MISSED CALLS

359
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,144
You didn't eat anything.

360
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,980
Eat up. You have to go to cram school.

361
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:57,825
Mom, are you going somewhere?

362
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:02,329
I'm meeting a friend.

363
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,539
I'll be right back.

364
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,500
Now eat up and go to cram school.

365
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,501
Okay.

366
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,257
One of the footprints we found on the hill

367
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,593
could be Park Jun-tae's.

368
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:59,219
So we're tracking him.

369
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,766
We found a footprint
that seems to be a woman's.

370
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,726
It's 230 mm.

371
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,820
Captain, could you take a look at this?

372
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,615
This is the CCTV footage
from Park Jun-tae's apartment.

373
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:20,866
It's from yesterday.

374
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,284
If you look here,

375
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:25,913
the overall outfit is not like
what Park Jun-tae usually wears.

376
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:30,834
There seem to be no shoelaces.
I don't think they're sneakers.

377
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,711
They're rain boots.

378
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:38,133
Check how many
fishing spots are around here.

379
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,177
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

380
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,882
I knew you'd be here.

381
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:25,889
Why didn't you answer my calls?

382
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,267
I was so worried about you.

383
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:32,604
What about school?

384
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,275
Did you go to work?

385
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,736
They'll find out everything.

386
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,031
I just want to…

387
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,953
come clean now

388
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,914
and be at peace.

389
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,333
What if things go wrong?

390
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,421
What am I supposed to do then?

391
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,091
I'm sorry.

392
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,095
If it weren't for me, you--

393
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,889
Can't you try to stay strong?

394
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:08,974
For me.

395
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,392
I just can't, Seong-hui.

396
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:12,811
Now…

397
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:18,192
I don't even know who I am anymore.

398
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,654
I know.

399
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:26,533
I know who you are, Jun-tae.

400
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,454
I know.

401
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:24,007
God damn it!

402
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:46,905
-Have you seen this person?
-Excuse me.

403
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,675
You fucking asshole!
I told you to stop seeing that bitch.

404
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:07,843
Watch your mouth.

405
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:09,928
Don't call her that.

406
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:19,771
You…

407
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:24,860
You son of a…

408
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:35,746
Fuck.

409
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:39,499
Mr. Park Jun-tae?

410
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:41,752
Mr. Park Jun-tae!

411
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:44,004
Mr. Park Jun-tae!

412
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:45,714
Mr. Park!

413
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:48,050
Close off all the roads. Choi is here.

414
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:54,431
This is crazy.

415
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,108
That way.

416
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,611
Don't go that way. Go this way.

417
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:08,695
Yes, sir.

418
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:11,156
Detective Choi!

419
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:12,532
-Detective Choi!
-Yes?

420
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:15,035
-Come over here.
-Yes, sir.

421
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,038
That little…

422
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,333
-Detective Cho…
-Fuck.

423
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,410
You fucking bastard.

424
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,634
My wife didn't kill her, right?

425
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,597
She only buried the body.

426
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,101
Why would she bury the body

427
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,437
if she didn't kill her?

428
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:26,815
-Why?
-She got it wrong.

429
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,735
She didn't know you killed her.

430
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:33,530
You killed Lee Su-hyeon, didn't you?

431
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:37,200
Don't be fucking ridiculous.

432
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,036
You fucker.

433
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:42,998
Tell me the truth.

434
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,292
Or I'll fabricate evidence
and put you in jail.

435
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,334
What the fuck?

436
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:51,381
Fine. I took the video
and extorted money from her.

437
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:52,632
Happy now?

438
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,468
But I didn't kill her.

439
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,970
I fucking didn't kill her!

440
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:58,680
You bastard.

441
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,143
I didn't make her do that.

442
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,646
She was doing the crazy shit herself.

443
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,982
I didn't tell her to bury it there!

444
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:15,989
Does Ha-bin know about this too?

445
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,618
Does she know or not, you bastard?

446
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:20,619
Why do you ask?

447
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:23,079
Are you afraid she might know?

448
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:27,083
Should I tell her
that her mom thought she was a murderer

449
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:31,213
and buried Lee Su-hyeon?

450
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:35,842
You little…

451
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,552
You son of a bitch!

452
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:41,431
You motherfucker.

453
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:43,850
You fucking son of a bitch.

454
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:06,748
Never show your face to my daughter again.

455
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:12,629
Once I find out…

456
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:16,925
why my wife did that,

457
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,846
I'm going to kill you.

458
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,271
You better not get caught.

459
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,316
What's your relationship
with Choi Yeong-min?

460
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,069
I just got to know him
while looking for Su-hyeon.

461
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:21,615
If he's just an acquaintance,
why did you fight with him today?

462
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:22,866
It's a personal matter.

463
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:25,702
I believe I'm not obligated to answer.

464
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,330
-Captain.
-How did it go?

465
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:33,460
We've confirmed that he has been
at the fishing spot since last night.

466
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,003
He wasn't at the mountain.

467
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:37,547
-That's a long time.
-What about Choi Yeong-min?

468
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:41,217
We're still looking for him,
but it looks like he managed to escape.

469
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,305
I didn't find anyone
who knew or saw Su-hyeon.

470
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:47,515
We think she was Su-hyeon's friend.

471
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:50,060
Does it ring a bell?

472
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:02,697
Captain.

473
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:06,493
Could you step out?

474
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:09,329
I said to step out for a second.

475
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,457
Let's take a short break, Captain--

476
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,876
What's your relationship
with Choi Yeong-min?

477
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,212
Mr. Jang.

478
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:18,797
Why did you meet Choi Yeong-min?

479
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:21,633
-Captain Jang.
-Why did you look for Su-hyeon?

480
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:24,844
-Captain Jang!
-Captain!

481
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,137
Get out!

482
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,932
-Captain Jang.
-Why did you look for her?

483
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:31,059
-Why did you tell me…
-Captain Jang!

484
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:32,227
Captain Jang!

485
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:34,854
What is the matter with you?

486
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,192
Calm down.

487
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:41,987
Clearly, you're going through something.

488
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:44,489
So go home and rest.

489
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,867
-Detective Kim.
-Yes, sir.

490
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,203
Captain, let's go.

491
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:57,544
INTERROGATION ROOM

492
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,217
Where's Captain Jang?

493
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:08,972
He wasn't in a state to drive.
Detective Park is driving him home.

494
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:12,017
-Do you know what's going on with him?
-No, I don't.

495
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:15,103
Release Park Jun-tae.

496
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,314
He wasn't at the mountain,
and things are not going well here.

497
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,483
-Let's reschedule the interview.
-Yes, sir.

498
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,369
Thanks for your cooperation today.

499
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,997
We'll see you again in the next interview.

500
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:38,710
Take care.

501
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:42,547
About Lee Su-hyeon…

502
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:44,883
What was her relationship with Ha-bin?

503
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:51,056
Actually…

504
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:54,976
she was Ha-bin's closest friend.

505
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,270
Why did you say you didn't know before?

506
00:55:57,937 --> 00:55:58,938
Ha-bin…

507
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:02,692
She lost her mother last year.

508
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,195
That alone must be
a lot for her to deal with.

509
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:07,030
I didn't want this investigation…

510
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:12,077
and Su-hyeon to add to it.

511
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:18,291
You can go home for now.
We'll see you in the next interview.

512
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:20,502
Get home safely.

513
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,564
Are you suspicious of Ha-bin?

514
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:46,069
Actually, I saw you
asking about Ha-bin at school.

515
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:51,199
Why are you so suspicious of her?

516
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:52,534
You just heard it

517
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,036
and saw it too.

518
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:57,747
Captain Jang is out of it.

519
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:02,836
Well, we don't know what exactly happened.

520
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,212
Do you want to know, though?

521
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:09,300
You're just avoiding
an uncomfortable situation.

522
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,803
Because he's on our team

523
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,180
and he's your superior.

524
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,307
The way I see it,

525
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:21,187
you're taking a very dangerous approach.

526
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:27,527
Once you start suspecting
and judging things hastily,

527
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,822
it can cause something irreversible.

528
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,909
Only the investigation will tell

529
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:37,579
who is wrong.

530
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,541
I want Ha-bin…

531
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:28,421
to live a normal life like others.

532
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:34,636
I can do this.

533
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:50,920
Do you want to play a game?

534
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,047
A game?

535
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:56,259
Every time you solve a quiz,
you can get the sushi you want.

536
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:58,177
-How does that sound?
-Sure.

537
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:01,347
Remember how the kids laughed

538
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:04,601
when the witch fell down
in the movie earlier?

539
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:08,187
-Why do you think they laughed?
-Because the main character won.

540
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,149
Right.

541
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,947
Why do you think
people cheer for the main character

542
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,574
when the witch is stronger?

543
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,536
Kids always like weak and sad characters.

544
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,372
Wrong.

545
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:27,707
That's not right.

546
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:31,002
They like the main character
because they're similar to them.

547
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:32,545
You can feel their emotions.

548
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,885
If the witch hit you,

549
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,136
how would you feel?

550
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,138
I would be angry.

551
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:44,974
What if the main character shows up
and gets angry with you?

552
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:46,684
Why would they get angry?

553
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:51,230
Because friends share joy and sadness.

554
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:53,232
I don't need that.

555
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:59,781
I want you to have many friends.

556
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:02,325
Seeing you alone

557
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:04,661
will make me sad.

558
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:09,415
I'm hungry.

559
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:32,939
You're doing a great job.

560
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:37,193
It won't be easy to do it alone.

561
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:41,489
Why don't you discuss it
with Ha-bin's dad?

562
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:44,992
No.

563
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:48,246
She knows how her dad

564
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,374
thinks of her.

565
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,715
Ha-bin may be
a bit different from other kids,

566
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:02,343
but she would never harm her brother.

567
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:09,350
I didn't want
to become suspicious like him.

568
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,397
That's why I divorced him.

569
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:17,859
I'm still scared

570
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:20,570
he might hurt Ha-bin

571
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:23,322
like that again.

572
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:37,665
TAE-SU

573
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:06,819
What about Mom?

574
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:14,619
Tell me.

575
01:05:26,797 --> 01:05:27,924
Was it…

576
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:32,053
all because of Mom?

577
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:34,597
Is that why…

578
01:05:36,974 --> 01:05:39,060
you approached Choi Yeong-min?

579
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,148
Did you want…

580
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:47,568
to take revenge on Song Min-a?

581
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:51,739
Ha-bin.

582
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:54,992
From this moment on, I will believe…

583
01:05:57,495 --> 01:05:58,788
everything you say.

584
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,250
So…

585
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:09,674
So please tell me.

586
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:13,386
I can't.

587
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:15,304
Why?

588
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:30,486
Why is it?

589
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:35,116
Why do you and your mom…

590
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:39,578
never say anything to me?

591
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:42,498
Why?

592
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:45,459
Why is that?

593
01:06:47,294 --> 01:06:48,796
Because I can't trust you.

594
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:51,632
What?

595
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:55,928
I don't trust you.

596
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:01,892
Why did you meet Mom…

597
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:04,854
on the day she died?

598
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:11,235
I know…

599
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:14,822
you were with her that day.

600
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:20,453
Did you think you could keep it a secret?

601
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,676
Do you want to die?

602
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,553
I can't take it anymore.

603
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:42,308
If you want to die so badly,

604
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:45,311
why don't you just die?

605
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,146
What's wrong?

606
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:48,439
Can't you do it?

607
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:47,456
About the day Mom died…

608
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:49,875
Why did you hide it from me?

609
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:53,129
Your mom killed Lee Su-hyeon.

610
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:56,382
To be honest,
I didn't want her to get in the way of it.

611
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:58,509
Are you happy now?

612
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:01,011
Why do you keep getting emotional?

613
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:03,305
Some things are more important
than investigations.

614
01:09:04,348 --> 01:09:05,599
It's me.

615
01:09:06,767 --> 01:09:08,060
Let's meet.
I'll tell you everything I know.

616
01:09:21,073 --> 01:09:26,078
