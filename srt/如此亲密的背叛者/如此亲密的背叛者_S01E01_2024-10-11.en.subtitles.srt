1
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,079
He's the witness.
He called us as soon as he found it.

2
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,705
Hello.

3
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,541
-You must've been startled.
-Oh, well.

4
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,126
I'm the detective in charge.

5
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,919
Let me ask you a few questions.

6
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,547
It's just a formality,
so there's no need to stress.

7
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,673
Okay.

8
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,341
Were you alone when you found it?

9
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,300
Yes, I was alone.

10
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,845
-Let me check your ID.
-What were you doing here?

11
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,598
My parents won't drink tap water

12
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,809
and I need to go to work
in the morning, so…

13
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,853
You must leave for work really early.

14
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,980
Yes. I head out at dawn.

15
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:31,192
Do you usually
take this path on this mountain?

16
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,324
Did we find anything?

17
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,784
Nothing so far.

18
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,203
Everything seems fine.

19
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,706
Check again.

20
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,737
Hey. You're here.

21
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,905
Yes.

22
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,782
Geez.

23
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,993
It won't be easy to identify them.

24
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,995
Seems like they were in high school.

25
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,290
No uniforms were found at the scene.

26
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:31,336
The development of the elbow bones
suggests they were older than 16.

27
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,212
And the shoulder bones aren't articulated,

28
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,423
which means they were under 20.

29
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,799
What a shame.

30
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,801
They never even had the chance to bloom.

31
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,889
Don't rush and take it easy.

32
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,101
Wait. Move your hand a bit.

33
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,055
Sir.

34
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,267
Captain Oh is looking for you.

35
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,189
Hey.

36
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,818
Something's off.
He keeps changing the story.

37
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,070
Ask him to come to the station
tomorrow morning.

38
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:40,905
I'll get going now.

39
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,407
This needs to be looked at now.

40
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,409
I have something important to look into.

41
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,578
This is a murder case.

42
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,913
What's more important than this?

43
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,709
It's not spring water, is it?

44
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,045
Why did you lie to us?

45
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,089
I'm sorry?

46
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,509
You can't tap trees illegally.

47
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,386
It's against the Forest Protection Act.

48
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,930
-Detective Kim.
-Yes.

49
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,349
-Send him over to the relevant department.
-Yes, sir.

50
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:11,894
Captain Jang.

51
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,777
You've got to pull your weight.

52
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:23,281
Everyone is working overtime here
and pulling all-nighters.

53
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,159
At the very least,
don't bring down the morale.

54
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:29,245
I need evidence to analyze the suspect.

55
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,875
I'll get to it
once you hand over the data.

56
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,168
Take it easy.

57
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:42,050
I heard he can figure everything out
just by looking at the crime scene.

58
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,009
Hey.

59
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,720
Are you still holding onto expectations?

60
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,139
Just give it up. He's leaving anyway.

61
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,183
Leaving? Where?

62
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,143
He's just here for a bit
before going back to HQ.

63
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:55,313
-Still, he can't always leave on the dot.
-Forget it.

64
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,233
Soon, we won't have to see
that annoying face again.

65
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,665
First, slice the zucchini.

66
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,543
Ideally, each slice
should be half an inch thick.

67
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:02,547
Slice them evenly so they cook evenly too.

68
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,511
Next, let's move on to beef seaweed soup.

69
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,762
It's easier than it looks.

70
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,180
Prepare the egg wash.

71
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,684
Coat the zucchini slices in flour

72
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,185
and toss them into the egg wash.

73
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,073
-Dad!
-Goodbye.

74
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,408
-Bye.
-Bye!

75
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,910
May is a family month.

76
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,412
Yesterday was Parents' Day.

77
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,791
If you haven't shared your love
with your parents yet…

78
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,461
-Today…
-Hey, Mom.

79
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,921
Yes, I'm done now.

80
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,715
It's been two months since she quit.

81
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:32,887
We were upset that Ha-bin
just quit out of the blue.

82
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,556
How's Ha-bin doing?

83
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,312
Good. Thanks for checking.

84
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,231
Sure.

85
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,200
Doors opening.

86
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,828
-Excuse me.
-Geez!

87
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,581
-Excuse me.
-My gosh.

88
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,707
Don't push me.

89
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,752
-Have a seat.
-Oh, my!

90
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,379
I'm so sorry.

91
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,006
Thank you.

92
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,097
Babe, could you try calling me?

93
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,182
What's up? Did you lose your phone?

94
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,602
I can't find it. Call me.

95
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,853
But it was right there.

96
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:04,895
I don't see it.

97
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,022
Look for it carefully.

98
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,190
Where could it be?

99
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,900
Maybe you left it at the restaurant.

100
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,528
No, I'm sure I took it before I left.

101
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,863
Just call me.

102
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,118
MY BABE

103
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,501
-What's going on?
-What's this sound?

104
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,879
What's going on?

105
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,548
What is this sound? Is this a ringtone?

106
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,704
"Jang Ha-bin?"

107
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,248
We don't have any students

108
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,377
registered under that name.

109
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,638
The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please…

110
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,269
MY DAUGHTER

111
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,605
SEND ME THE LIBRARY ADDRESS
I'LL COME PICK YOU UP

112
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,982
ICARUS LIBRARY

113
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,330
Hello.

114
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,709
-Name.
-Jang Ha-bin.

115
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,045
Age and resident registration number.

116
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:57,007
It's 070509-4211593.

117
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,384
I'm 18.

118
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,763
For a student,
you're pretty good at fighting.

119
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:07,518
Kids these days…
If things don't go their way,

120
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,478
they immediately get physical.

121
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,480
THANK YOU, I LOVE YOU

122
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,870
Thanks to my dad,
I learned all kinds of sports.

123
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,289
Well, it wasn't so that
you could get into fights.

124
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,125
I understand him though.

125
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:35,296
He sees rapists and murderers every day.

126
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,339
Is he a police officer?

127
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,300
Yes.

128
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,511
He's always been worried about me
since I was little.

129
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,014
He'd tell me to be careful of strangers

130
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,308
and that I should always

131
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,394
be able to defend myself.

132
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,898
I didn't mean to fight.

133
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,817
I was just trying to protect myself.

134
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,861
Protect, my ass. What a crazy bitch.

135
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,739
Be quiet. Watch your mouth.

136
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,496
Hello. You must be her father.

137
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,622
Yes.

138
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,750
What happened?

139
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,421
The kids had a little scuffle.

140
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,757
It was mutual.

141
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,509
I'm sure you can reach a settlement.

142
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:22,843
But there's another problem.

143
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:24,803
Please go ahead.

144
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:28,641
We found several stolen phones
at the scene,

145
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,685
and they're all insisting that
they didn't do it.

146
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:36,315
They've all run away from their home
and they've been on probation.

147
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,694
Where were they caught?

148
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,738
The location we responded to

149
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,657
was a motel.

150
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,118
Why were you there?

151
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,038
What are you thinking?

152
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,874
Did you go there voluntarily?

153
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,629
Can we talk about this later?

154
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,924
Hey, you said you'd run away too.

155
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,426
You said you wanted to join our gang.

156
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,555
Is that true?

157
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,848
I've never said that.

158
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,017
And they stole the phones.

159
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:35,291
We'll cooperate with the investigation.
Let me know if you need anything.

160
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,084
Will do.

161
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,943
It's expired.

162
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,155
Just eat the meal I've prepared for you.

163
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,517
When are you moving out?

164
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,228
What?

165
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,230
Aren't you going back to HQ next month?

166
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,691
I can postpone that.

167
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,109
Don't worry about it.

168
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,069
Just go back.

169
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,656
Then you'll have to live by yourself.

170
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,867
Wasn't that expected
when you divorced Mom?

171
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,329
We were going to live separately anyway.

172
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,552
I know that.

173
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,181
I haven't been a good father to you.

174
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,936
So from now on,
I want to spend more time--

175
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,187
I…

176
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,275
don't want to.

177
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,537
Sit. I'm not done yet.

178
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,331
Jang Ha-bin.

179
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,461
What have you been doing lately?

180
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,337
You quit the academy

181
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,381
and lied that
you were going to the library.

182
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,967
Why did you meet the runaway girls?

183
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,427
Why did you go to the motel?

184
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,599
All my life, I never had a dad.

185
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,021
So why would I want one now?

186
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,816
Just don't do anything.

187
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,402
Please.

188
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,412
I've never said that.

189
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,249
And they stole the phones.

190
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:39,219
The victim seems to be a woman
in her late teens, about 168 cm tall.

191
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:42,806
As you can see, there's no remaining
skin tissue or cartilage,

192
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,184
so it will be difficult
to identify the victim.

193
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,770
What does
the National Forensic Service say?

194
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,899
They're going to try
and collect DNA from the femur,

195
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,109
but it's going to take
at least a few weeks.

196
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,153
And there's no sign of skeletal trauma,

197
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,614
which makes it hard
to determine the cause of death.

198
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:03,327
So we don't know
who it is or how she died.

199
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:08,665
We're now making a list of missing women
in that area around that age.

200
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,294
Identifying the victim
is our first priority.

201
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,713
Make sure Team One
gets all the help necessary.

202
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,506
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

203
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,596
-Sir.
-Yes.

204
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,389
Can I please have a word with you?

205
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,851
Captain Jang, you know we have
an interview for your successor, right?

206
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,270
No, you've never mentioned it.

207
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,105
I haven't?

208
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,399
I thought I did.

209
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,026
If you have some time, I--

210
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:40,197
Why don't we talk after the interview?

211
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,292
-This way.
-Thanks.

212
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:11,687
Hello. Are you perhaps here
for the interview?

213
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,773
-Yes.
-Good. How are you doing?

214
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,069
You're here early.

215
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,530
-Yes. How are you?
-Good.

216
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,657
I got lost on my way here.

217
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:49,891
-Do you want one?
-I'm good.

218
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,272
Come in.

219
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,735
What should we do? Should I go first?

220
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,777
Sure.

221
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,863
Good luck.

222
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,163
-He wants both of us to come in.
-Okay.

223
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,666
Looks like
he'll interview us at the same time.

224
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,504
-Officer Gu Dae-hong.
-Yes.

225
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,922
Do you have nephews or nieces?

226
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:26,053
Oh, yes. Did I write it in there?

227
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,931
Oh, this got stuck here.

228
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,310
It's actually mine.

229
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:36,438
My hobby is journaling.

230
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,565
I love decorating my journals.

231
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:42,360
I've always loved journaling
since I was a kid.

232
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:46,490
Collecting stickers and all, so…

233
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:52,120
What about you, Officer Lee Eo-jin?
Do you have any hobbies?

234
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,581
I don't, sir. Work is fun enough.

235
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:56,416
That's ideal.

236
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:01,922
Officer Gu, you have
a master's degree in an unrelated field.

237
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,882
Why did you become a cop?

238
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:07,135
I don't know. I somehow ended up here.

239
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,471
Officer Lee.

240
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,182
What do you think
is the most important thing

241
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,184
when investigating
an abduction-murder case?

242
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,728
Confirming objective facts

243
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:20,524
and avoiding connecting the dots
based on assumptions without evidence.

244
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:29,199
Understanding the victim's personality.

245
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,742
I think that's the top priority.

246
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:31,660
Why is that?

247
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,453
At the end of the day,

248
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:37,332
crimes are committed
by humans and human interactions.

249
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:40,669
Depending on the victim's personality,

250
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,214
the case can be received
in a million different ways.

251
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,966
I disagree.

252
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,593
There's clearly a limit
to victim-centered investigation.

253
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,053
She disagrees.

254
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,263
Convince her.

255
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,725
Analyzing facts is important too.

256
00:23:55,809 --> 00:24:01,857
But we need to know if the victim
was a bubbly person or a shy person,

257
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,900
and if they were defensive to the attack

258
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,653
or actively fighting against it.

259
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:09,906
I think we should see
from the person's perspective

260
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,992
to be able to analyze the case.

261
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,202
But it can be too emotionally consuming

262
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,329
and can lead you to be biased.

263
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:20,041
We must consider both victims and suspects
as objects to analyze

264
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,585
to maintain objectivity.

265
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,920
But as police officers,

266
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:27,883
don't we have a duty
to consider the victims' suffering?

267
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,759
If I were the victim,

268
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:33,763
I would like the police
to catch the culprit, not cry for me.

269
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:38,268
I think empathy
is one of the core investigative skills.

270
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,936
What do you think?

271
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:46,818
Sir.

272
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,070
Can I have a minute, please?

273
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,574
I've been reading the columns
you write for the police magazine.

274
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,909
No need for small talk.

275
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:55,869
Just get to the point.

276
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,829
If I get hired,

277
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,956
does that mean I can work with you?

278
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,042
You'll know once you get hired.

279
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,836
If not, you won't.

280
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,046
That was one minute.

281
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,890
Did the interview go well?

282
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,601
Yes.

283
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,937
You said you wanted to talk with me.

284
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,688
I…

285
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,359
I'd like to stay and work here.

286
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:31,154
I have no power
to go against the higher-ups' decisions.

287
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,073
That's how it's been decided.

288
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,494
I promise I'll work harder.

289
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,706
My daughter will be
a high school senior next year,

290
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,376
and I'm the only one
who can look after her.

291
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,420
I'm really sorry,
but I'm afraid I can't help you with that.

292
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,175
So who do you think is better?

293
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:53,885
As your successor.

294
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,513
APPLICATION FOR CRIMINAL
BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS DIVISION

295
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,852
I'm sure you're a better judge
of character than I am.

296
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,231
Looks pretty competent.

297
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:12,279
CRIMINAL BEHAVIORAL
ANALYSIS DIVISION HANDOVER PLAN

298
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,951
-Detective Cho.
-Yes.

299
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:21,288
Try expanding the area
of the missing person's reports.

300
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,623
We've got a lot already.
To look into every--

301
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,542
Hey, do you have any problem with it?

302
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,501
No, sir.

303
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:28,086
Have you reached out to nearby schools?

304
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,212
He's in charge.

305
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,881
About the list of students
absent without notice? I have.

306
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,926
The estimated time of burial
was within one year.

307
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,595
Get a list of students
who were absent around then.

308
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,513
Yes, sir.

309
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,307
-It's printed.
-Good.

310
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,726
Hey, I told you to do it.

311
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:47,022
If you're not busy,
why don't we have dinner together?

312
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,190
We won't be working together
for much longer.

313
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,984
I'm good. Thanks.

314
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:52,777
Pardon?

315
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,237
You said you'd check it.

316
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,655
I'll get to it right now.

317
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,828
Is he horribly anti-social
or is he just a homebody?

318
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:04,122
He always says
he's going home for his daughter.

319
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,206
He's an affectionate dad.

320
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,042
Does she go to day care or something?

321
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,169
We're all dads,
and we don't fuss about it.

322
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,810
Next time, I should…

323
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,025
I wish our classes ended at the same time.

324
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:43,703
Are you having dinner?

325
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,333
No, I'm not hungry.

326
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:52,003
I saw you with a friend.

327
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,174
Is he your boyfriend?

328
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:58,927
He's just a classmate.

329
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:02,597
Okay. Get some rest.

330
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,488
What was that?

331
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:22,700
My phone was buzzing.

332
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,036
It came from the bag.

333
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,913
It was my phone.

334
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:29,791
Open your bag.

335
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,169
No.

336
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,271
What's this?

337
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,523
It's my friend's.

338
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,358
Which friend?

339
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:58,820
As if you'd know if I say the name.

340
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,993
Why would your friend want you to keep it?

341
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,913
Maybe there are more parents
who check their children's bags.

342
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:16,045
Why? Do you think I stole the phone?

343
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:16,963
What?

344
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:21,092
You didn't believe me
at the police station.

345
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,722
How could I believe you
when you've been lying to me?

346
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,518
Do you want to believe it, though?

347
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,938
Don't change the subject.

348
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,356
Tell me honestly about that day.

349
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:39,819
Give it back.

350
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,238
Bring me the phone owner.

351
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,741
Then I'll give it back.

352
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:56,711

Hi, Lieutenant Park. It's me.

356
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,240
Could you run a phone number?

357
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,579
Find out the owner's name
and whether it was reported lost.

358
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,918
The number is…

359
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:40,088
I'll check and get back to you.

360
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,466
By the way,
you're coming back soon, right?

361
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,386
Well, I'm not sure.

362
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,513
Let me know how it goes.

363
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:13,389
DEVIATION AND CRIMINAL SOCIOLOGY

364
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:47,256
CALL ME NOW, BITCH,
OR YOU'RE DEAD

365
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,352
Ha-bin.

366
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,773
Ha-bin.

367
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,174
Ha-bin.

368
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:13,718
Ha-bin!

369
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,012
Jang Ha-bin!

370
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,060
Are you running away from home now?

371
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,401
You could've told me
you were going on a field trip.

372
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:46,793
Why?

373
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,672
Do you think I stole the phone?

374
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:15,965
Hello, sir.

375
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,425
Hello, sir.

376
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,387
I'd like to ask you something.

377
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,764
I was actually going to reach out to you.

378
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,475
Please have a seat.

379
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:35,902
YEONJU POLICE STATION

380
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,369
Hello, sir.

381
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:51,626
Thanks.

382
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,877
How can I help you?

383
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,172
I'll be working in
the Criminal Behavioral Analysis Division.

384
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,840
I'm Officer Lee Eo-jin.

385
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:01,219
Oh, sure. Come on in.

386
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:05,097
So you're the new person.

387
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,810
This is
the Criminal Behavioral Analysis Division.

388
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,687
You can use this desk.

389
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:14,899
You look younger than I expected.
How old are you?

390
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:15,942
I have a baby face.

391
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,026
Pardon?

392
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,278
Sir.

393
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:22,281
This is the new officer in
the Criminal Behavioral Analysis Division.

394
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,700
Hello.

395
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:28,120
I'm the new officer in
the Criminal Behavioral Analysis Division.

396
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,164
I'm Officer Gu Dae-hong.

397
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,082
Nice to meet you.

398
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,211
I thought they hired one officer.

399
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,506
Yes. He's the one.

400
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,175
Then what about her?

401
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,093
Who are you?

402
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,275
I HEARD YOU QUIT THE ACADEMY
WHAT'S UP?

403
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,235
WHERE ARE YOU?
ANSWER YOUR PHONE

404
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,611
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU
I…

405
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:01,988
Captain Jang.

406
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,239
Yes.

407
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,241
Hello.

408
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,956
Right. It's been busy lately,

409
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,833
so I told him to hire both.

410
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,459
This is Officer Gu Dae-hong

411
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,919
and this is Officer Lee…

412
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,297
What was your name again?

413
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,589
Officer Lee Eo-jin, sir.

414
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:21,966
Right. Lee Eo-jin.

415
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,843
Anyway, I hope we get along.

416
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:24,927
Yes, sir.

417
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,263
Goodbye, sir.

418
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,306
Goodbye.

419
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,615
When did you get the phone call

420
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,451
that you were hired?

421
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,703
After the interview that day,

422
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,663
on my way home.

423
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,666
Directly from Captain Jang?

424
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,917
Yes.

425
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,045
I thought I wouldn't get hired,
but I made it.

426
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,631
What's wrong?

427
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,051
What's wrong?

428
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,054
What's the matter?

429
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,430
Nothing.

430
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:10,890
Look.

431
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,268
This is my favorite character.

432
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,687
The name is Rise.

433
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,647
-He--
-I didn't ask.

434
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:39,877
WHY…

435
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,113
PATROL OFFICER JUNG CHAN-HO:
HERE'S THE VIDEO YOU REQUESTED.

436
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,865
CAPTAIN JANG,
HERE'S THE VIDEO YOU REQUESTED.

437
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:19,333
About the phones.

438
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,460
She was right.
Those runaway girls stole them.

439
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,592
You read criminals like a book,

440
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,220
yet you're clueless about your daughter.

441
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,058
I don't know.

442
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,401
I'm totally clueless.

443
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,403
You believe her no matter what.

444
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,656
Is it that hard for you?

445
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,829
Why aren't you saying anything?

446
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,210
Are you going to ruin our kid too?

447
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:12,881
What?

448
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,011
Think about why I died.

449
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,100
It was because of you.

450
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:01,347
Then tell me.

451
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,810
What should I have done differently?

452
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:42,888
DAD

453
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:05,953
We're getting
a lot of reports this morning.

454
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:07,704
You're right.

455
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,501
I don't think
I have taken this path before.

456
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:17,339
Let's just check the scene real quick
and go grab some food.

457
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,478
Quick!

458
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:45,742
What…

459
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,337
This is Patrol Team 20.

460
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,798
We just checked the reported warehouse.

461
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,592
We need backup urgently.

462
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,679
Are you sure it was human blood?

463
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:06,889
Yes.

464
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:08,682
They ran a complete blood test.

465
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:12,519
And according to the forensic team,
there were over two liters of blood.

466
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,812
So it's a murder case.

467
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:19,610
Did you find something?

468
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:20,819
Yes.

469
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:24,072
It's from a woman with blood type O.
Other than the blood,

470
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,908
we don't have
any other samples to compare.

471
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:26,992
What about the CCTV?

472
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:30,245
Geographically speaking, it's likely
a car was involved in the crime.

473
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,914
So we're checking the cars in the area.

474
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:34,041
Find the body first.

475
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,001
This isn't like the skeleton case.

476
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:40,339
Once reporters find out there's no body,
they will come running over.

477
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,091
So keep it under wraps.

478
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,343
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

479
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,518
Sir.

480
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:55,938
Please let me investigate this case
before I leave.

481
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:59,066
I thought I made myself clear.
You even hired your successors.

482
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,944
Due to geographic reasons,
it'll be hard to find evidence.

483
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:04,530
We don't have a body,
which is key evidence.

484
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,742
But I'm sure
there's still behavioral evidence.

485
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:12,204
I'm sure there is something
I can help with.

486
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,748
Move. Hurry up.

487
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:17,501
-Move.
-Yes, sir.

488
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:18,669
Check everywhere.

489
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,462
Make sure to be thorough and precise.

490
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:21,630
Yes, sir.

491
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,131
-Check here too.
-Yes, sir.

492
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:25,759
-Let's get to it.
-Move it.

493
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:26,885
Check up there too.

494
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:29,721
I'll give you two months.
That's the best I can do.

495
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:31,765
Wrap it up by then.

496
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:35,018
Go deeper! Yes, over there!

497
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,728
Go deeper.

498
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:40,357
Hey, call them now.

499
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,692
Keep going.

500
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:44,444
This area is clear.

501
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,029
Did you find anything?

502
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:50,951
I can't believe
we haven't found the body yet.

503
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:55,080
-Hurry.
-We're working on it.

504
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:07,593
I think the rain washed away
all the footprints.

505
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,720
What about tire marks?

506
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:12,306
There are some left,
but they're all squashed.

507
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,467
Do what you need to do.

508
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,010
Don't mind me.

509
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:53,305
-Yes.
-Yes, sir.

510
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:07,944
Did you find anything?

511
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:10,947
Not yet.

512
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,449
It's clean here.

513
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:17,496
There are potential weapons everywhere,

514
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,665
but none of them has bloodstains on them.

515
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,877
And there's no sign of wiping.

516
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,296
I feel like this crime was premeditated.

517
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,341
I apologize, sir.

518
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:31,134
As I said, do whatever you need to do.

519
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,842
Okay. Bye.

520
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:14,678
I just talked with the warehouse owner.

521
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:17,097
And it looks like you're right.
It's disappeared.

522
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:19,933
So it was here before?

523
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:21,017
Yes.

524
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:23,311
But why did you ask about it?

525
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:27,691
They found something.

526
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:30,235
-Go up.
-Keep going.

527
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:31,945
Keep going up.

528
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:33,405
I said, go up.

529
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,699
-Over there.
-I think this is…

530
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,621
We should show this to Captain.

531
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:42,622
-He's here.
-Okay.

532
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:46,793
What's this?

533
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:49,463
The search dog found it.

534
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:51,715
Was it to bury the body?

535
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:57,095
But it's too small to bury a body.

536
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:00,474
It looks like the culprit dug this.

537
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,809
Right?

538
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:05,353
What?

539
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:06,772
Search thoroughly!

540
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:07,939
Check over there.

541
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,900
-Darn it.
-Come and check this out.

542
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:12,944
-Here?
-No, further down.

543
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,321
I think he didn't hear you.

544
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,948
-Over here.
-Move over a bit.

545
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:23,371
Have a seat. You can relax.

546
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,040
Yes, sir.

547
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:31,296
Say anything.

548
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:35,091
I think the victim
voluntarily went to the scene.

549
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,384
What's your reason for it?

550
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,762
Based on the amount of blood found,

551
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:41,097
the victim weighed over 40 kg.

552
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,308
To force someone of that size up the hill,

553
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:45,560
there must have been
some traces left behind.

554
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,980
The crime scene is in a secluded area.

555
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:53,109
Either the victim had a reason
to visit that place

556
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:55,779
or was likely lured to the place.

557
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:00,867
I think that's completely wrong.

558
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:05,080
The culprit, who was familiar
with the area and the house,

559
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:07,499
must have checked the scene in advance.

560
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:09,167
With the help of their accomplice,

561
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:12,379
they brought the victim to the house
who was already unconscious.

562
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:15,674
If the victim was conscious,
she would've resisted.

563
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,302
But the crime scene was too clean.
What do you think?

564
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,180
Right. I'll look into it again.

565
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:24,766
What do you think, Office Gu?

566
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:30,605
Well, I think
both of you made valid points.

567
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,691
-You think?
-Yes.

568
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:34,067
You're neutral.

569
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,240
What are you writing?

570
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:41,616
What you're saying, sir.

571
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,993
What are you doing?

572
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:45,954
Why won't you refute me?

573
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:46,955
First,

574
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:49,082
the chance of the scene
being tampered with.

575
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:53,086
Second, no alcohol or drugs
were found in the victim's blood.

576
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:54,212
It's on the report.

577
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,755
And third, there's no body.

578
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,425
We can't find any sign of drugging,
let alone an attack.

579
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:01,052
You could've asked how I was
so sure the victim was unconscious.

580
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:03,305
-Why didn't you?
-I read the report.

581
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,724
-And I did have those questions.
-And?

582
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:08,393
I thought there must be a reason
why you were so certain.

583
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:09,686
You're the worst.

584
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,276
I didn't tell you to relax to be friends.

585
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:19,654
There are no ranks in the meeting room.

586
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:22,991
From now on,
don't step into the meeting room

587
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:24,743
if you're not ready for a fierce argument.

588
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:26,411
I don't want to waste my time.

589
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:36,504
Are you okay?

590
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:42,010
From now on…

591
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:47,307
I really want to do better.

592
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:50,518
Hey.

593
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,063
I heard you're leaving after this case.

594
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:54,105
Yes.

595
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,859
-Did you find anything from the scene?
-I don't know yet.

596
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:58,985
Wait.

597
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,403
We're having a meeting now--

598
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:01,738
I'm not attending it.

599
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:04,491
-Why not?
-I'll check the minutes later.

600
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:07,661
Hey!

601
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,289
This little…

602
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:14,125
There's a limit to my patience.

603
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:18,088
Are you alone in this investigation?

604
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,839
Can't you see your colleagues?

605
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,967
Or are you just disrespecting me?

606
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,885
The missing body.

607
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:27,097
I'm sure the culprit threw it
in the reservoir in the town.

608
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,349
Drain the water and check.

609
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,726
-Are you sure?
-No.

610
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:34,980
Based on the amount of blood found,

611
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:37,649
the body was dismembered
and disposed of in the sewage.

612
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:40,694
Search all the nearby septic tanks.
We might find it.

613
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,362
What? Is this a joke to you?

614
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:44,781
Thinking out loud is easy, Captain Oh.

615
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,534
Because I won't be the one to act on it.

616
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,913
Nothing is certain for now.

617
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:54,833
I'll get back to you
once things become clearer.

618
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,042
Are we good now?

619
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,022
CHAT

620
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,399
CALL ME WHEN YOU SEE THIS

621
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:36,411
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU

622
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:54,762
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU

623
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,604
Why do you think they left the blood here?

624
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:48,066
Do you think they did it on purpose?

625
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:51,819
The culprit had one goal.

626
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,616
They came here to deal with the body.

627
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:23,893
The murder wasn't

628
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,854
carried out here.

629
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:29,983
The walls are clean.

630
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:32,735
There are no projected bloodstains.

631
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:36,739
Seeing the amount of blood lost,
the culprit meant to dismember

632
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:38,741
and bury the body.

633
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,785
Not only did they prepare the weapons,

634
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,789
but also a shovel to dig a hole.

635
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:46,791
After preparing it so thoroughly,

636
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,377
why didn't they bury the body?

637
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:51,713
Something came up.

638
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:57,135
Because something unexpected came up.

639
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,890
It's not that
they didn't clean up the blood,

640
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:04,976
they couldn't.

641
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:07,478
So it didn't go as they planned.

642
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:10,607
No matter how calm they are,

643
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:13,526
they must've been flustered.

644
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:17,989
So they had to take it.

645
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:22,493
It's not the heater that they needed.
It was the oil.

646
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:27,498
Maybe there was other evidence
he had to burn urgently.

647
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:31,127
If not this crime scene, what could it be?

648
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:33,463
The culprit is familiar
with investigative methods.

649
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:35,798
He knew it would be impossible

650
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:38,384
to identify the victim
just with the bloodstain.

651
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:42,096
There was another piece of evidence
he had to take care of

652
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,849
more urgently than the blood.

653
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:48,353
Perhaps it was the kind of evidence

654
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:50,855
that could reveal their identity.

655
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:54,525
Something they couldn't take with them

656
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:57,820
or leave behind.

657
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:11,167
The second crime scene.

658
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:14,879
Detective Kim, did you look into it?

659
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:16,547
Yes. There are multiple roads

660
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:19,258
to the scene, but to leave,
you must go through a tunnel.

661
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:20,927
And the numbers don't match.
One car is missing.

662
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:27,225
We're looking for a vehicle
abandoned near the crime scene.

663
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:29,560
There could be signs of attempted arson.

664
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:32,939
Please report in
as soon as you locate the vehicle.

665
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:47,704
Hello, ma'am.

666
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,455
Hello, Mr. Jang.

667
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:53,751
I was told that Ha-bin missed
the self-study session today.

668
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:56,129
Self-study session?

669
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:58,297
Isn't today
the last day of the field trip?

670
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:01,884
Ha-bin didn't apply for the field trip.

671
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:07,765
Those who didn't apply
must join the self-study session.

672
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:11,436
Where do you think Ha-bin is right now?

673
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:16,441
I'm sorry, ma'am.

674
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:18,943
I'll call you back.

675
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:41,591
You said you'd run away too.

676
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:44,177
You said you wanted to join our gang.

677
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:04,238
Lieutenant Park, it's me.

678
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:07,325
-I…
-I was going to call you, actually.

679
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:11,037
-Yes?
-About the number you asked me to run,

680
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,663
it turned out to be a burner phone.

681
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:21,672
Lieutenant Park.

682
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:25,259
Could you locate a phone right now?
It's urgent.

683
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:51,118
I'll go to the town
and see if the car owner is there.

684
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:52,411
Yes, sir.

685
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,247
I'll check the CCTVs
and the gas stations nearby.

686
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,498
-Okay.
-Look thoroughly.

687
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:56,666
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

688
01:04:01,128 --> 01:04:02,588
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

689
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:09,345
All the evidence
that might have provided clues

690
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:12,390
to identify the victim has been burned.

691
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:17,353
And the car seems to have hit the tree
after an abrupt turn.

692
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:20,565
The scene down there
suggests it's the victim that fell.

693
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:24,402
But it's hard to tell if the person fell

694
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:28,656
due to a crash
or while trying to avoid something.

695
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,661
-Leave it for now.
-Yes, sir.

696
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:50,803
MOUNT DAEHWA,
CURRENT LOCATION

697
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:56,309
LAST LOCATED

698
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:00,730
LIEUTENANT PARK MYEONG-JUN

699
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:03,190
THE PHONE IS OFF NOW,
AND THIS IS WHERE IT WAS LAST ON

700
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:06,652
LAST LOCATED,
CURRENT LOCATION

701
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:18,289
LAST LOCATED,
CURRENT LOCATION

702
01:05:25,379 --> 01:05:26,964
Why did she come here?

703
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:35,890
The victim.

704
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:37,975
What was the victim's blood type again?

705
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,060
It was O.

706
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:42,021
Are you sure it was O?

707
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:43,564
Yes, sir.

708
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,277
MY DAUGHTER

709
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:43,082
Someone has definitely fallen here,
but we still haven't found a bloodstain.

710
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:44,375
I found something here.

711
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:47,211
What is it?

712
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,801
Do you know if the DNA matches?

713
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:55,970
It'll come out soon. Whose is it?

714
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:02,143
There's a high chance

715
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:05,813
that this evidence was made
when someone got hit by the car

716
01:07:05,896 --> 01:07:07,231
and then fell into the bush.

717
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:09,650
Who do you think it could've been?

718
01:07:43,684 --> 01:07:44,894
The victim, right?

719
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:47,897
It could be the culprit.

720
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:03,305
Are you sure?

721
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:05,766
They're totally unrelated.

722
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:45,014
What do you mean, explain?

723
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:48,475
She just jumped in front of my car
when the light was red.

724
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:14,168
LAST LOCATED,
CURRENT LOCATION

725
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:32,681
It's vivid red.

726
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:34,850
What could it be?

727
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:38,729
If he really is the culprit,
he must be thinking now

728
01:12:39,813 --> 01:12:41,315
about whether he's missing something

729
01:12:41,398 --> 01:12:43,901
or if there's a chance
he might get caught.

730
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:46,904
Then he'll definitely make a move.

731
01:12:54,661 --> 01:12:55,913
Do you think Ha-jun…

732
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,000
really died by accident?

733
01:13:07,132 --> 01:13:10,302
