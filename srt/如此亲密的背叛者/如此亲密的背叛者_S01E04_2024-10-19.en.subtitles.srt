1
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:58,767
Darn it.

2
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,268
Where on earth is it?

3
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:50,610
Did you open it?

4
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,195
No.

5
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:55,907
Sure you didn't.

6
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,246
Keep it up.

7
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,337
Will there be another gig like this?

8
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,339
This is just the beginning.

9
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,551
What do you do
in case of a delivery accident?

10
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,263
I'll say, I found the bag on the street

11
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,764
and I don't know you.

12
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,685
Good. Keep it up.

13
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,523
By the way, who put the money in there?

14
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:40,743
Why don't you hold that curiosity in
and be happy with your tip?

15
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:41,661
Okay.

16
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,034
What?

17
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,453
What happened?

18
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,096
-Are you sure it wasn't there?
-I told you. There was nothing.

19
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,431
You fucking bitch.

20
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,852
You took that money, didn't you?

21
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,063
If I did, I wouldn't have come back here.

22
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,398
Don't be ridiculous.

23
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,526
What's ridiculous is
that the money is suddenly gone, bitch!

24
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,361
Why are you taking it out on me?

25
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,487
You fucking…

26
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,574
Was it really not you?

27
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,825
No.

28
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,661
Like I said, there was nothing there!

29
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,997
Fuck!

30
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,957
After all I've done for you!

31
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,250
God damn it!

32
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,418
I fed you

33
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,711
and put a roof over you!

34
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,212
Damn it.

35
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,006
God damn it!

36
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:41,758
Damn you!

37
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,293
Type your PIN.

38
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:48,926
LOCKER

39
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,988
I must know who you are.

40
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,872
Because

41
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,502
I'm going to

42
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,713
kill you.

43
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,274
-That was so close.
-I know, right?

44
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,443
I wonder what that siren was about.

45
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,534
Someone must've called the police.
They're outside.

46
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,451
Come on.

47
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,794
Gosh, I haven't run like that in a while.
I almost died.

48
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,754
Min-a, give me some water.

49
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,009
Thank you.

50
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,641
-You look familiar.
-Don't you remember me?

51
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:25,106
I saw you around the motels.
You do sugar dating too, right?

52
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,234
Is that why you helped me?

53
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,360
Not really.

54
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,238
We seemed to be in a similar spot.

55
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,156
-Did you run away from home?
-Not yet.

56
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,534
I want to save money first.

57
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,538
Do you know any gang?

58
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,373
You know what?

59
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,459
Screw the gangs. They're stupid.

60
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,462
I'm so sweaty. I'm going to take a shower.

61
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,589
Okay.

62
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,340
DAD

63
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,767
Are you guys in a gang right now?

64
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:05,187
Yes, but I'm going to quit.
I'm leaving the neighborhood.

65
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,189
Why?

66
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,113
-Where are you going?
-None of your business.

67
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,285
I was just curious.
Do you want to exchange numbers?

68
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,704
Sorry.

69
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,456
I only give my numbers to men.

70
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,238
-What are you doing?
-I'm going to report you. You're a thief.

71
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,744
-Hello. Is this the police?
-You crazy bitch!

72
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,456
What's your deal?
What the heck is wrong with you?

73
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,500
Name.

74
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,461
Answer me. What's your name?

75
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,132
-Song Min-a.
-Song Min-a.

76
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,301
Resident registration number.

77
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,471
It's 060122

78
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,057
and 4129384.

79
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,852
Four, one, two, nine, three…

80
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:27,812
Phone number?

81
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,356
Come on. Tell me your phone number.

82
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,860
Hello, Song Min-a.

83
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,546
I downloaded the GPS tracking app.

84
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,005
Check it.

85
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,164
Let's meet.

86
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,333
I'll give you your phone back.

87
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,080
I've been waiting for this day.

88
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,291
Min-a.

89
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,335
So,

90
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,214
please hurry.

91
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,512
SCENE EVIDENCE
VERIFIABLE ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE

92
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,139
The skeleton found in the mountain.

93
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,266
We found its DNA here.

94
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:35,439
Are you saying
this could be a serial killer case?

95
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,317
One piece of evidence
for two separate cases.

96
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,278
The two cases are definitely related.

97
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,116
There could have been

98
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,118
another victim before Song Min-a.

99
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:09,932
Captain Jang.

100
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,437
Where did you get this evidence?

101
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,783
Tell me. Where did you get this evidence?

102
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,538
We need to find a person.

103
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,208
What? I'm asking
where you got the evidence…

104
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,339
Lee Su-hyeon.

105
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,341
I checked,

106
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,093
and she's been
off the grid since last year.

107
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,512
LEE SU-HYEON

108
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,556
In most cases, this means she's a victim.

109
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:56,437
-Was the evidence really from Su-hyeon?
-That's what Captain Jang said.

110
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,523
Her name and school were written
on the bag containing the evidence.

111
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,775
We've talked with
all the students named Su-hyeon,

112
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,277
and none of them sent it.

113
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,864
Wasn't the boy who helped you
confirm the alibi also named Lee Su-hyeon?

114
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,617
Yes. I found nothing suspicious
about him either.

115
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,578
She dropped out of school last year,

116
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,372
and she's been off the grid since.
Something's fishy.

117
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,249
I'll go to her address and check.

118
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,085
Bring one of the detectives with you.

119
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,003
Okay.

120
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,506
STUDENT RECORD

121
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,345
It's common sense that you can't work
on a case while being audited.

122
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,473
Considering the urgency
of the investigation,

123
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,101
we will get back to you soon
with the audit schedule.

124
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,105
THE COPS ARE FOLLOWING
WAIT UNTIL I TEXT YOU AGAIN

125
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,291
-Dig in.
-It's delicious.

126
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,501
Thanks, man.

127
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,294
Do you really not want any?

128
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,504
You go ahead.

129
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,840
Don't you get tired of tteokbokki?

130
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:49,591
It's tasty.

131
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,801
Eat up.

132
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,220
No. Just eat up.

133
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,890
By the way, Yeong-min,

134
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,561
we ran out of our allowance.

135
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,522
Because of the crackdown these days,

136
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,191
we won't be able to work, so…

137
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,036
-Yes!
-Give me some.

138
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,954
-Come on!
-We need to share.

139
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,706
-Give me some.
-Are you done, fuckers?

140
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,878
Who was it?

141
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,679
Who told the police
that I wasn't in the house that day?

142
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,851
It wasn't us.
I told them you were with us that night.

143
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,312
I called you as soon as
the interrogation was over.

144
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,440
Then why are the police
keeping an eye on me?

145
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,197
So you don't want to tell me.

146
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,781
CHOI YEONG-MIN - LEADER
OF THE RUNAWAY GANG, NO ALIBI

147
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:41,495
HE KNOWS CAPTAIN JANG
HOW? SINCE WHEN?

148
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,748
What are you thinking about?

149
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,754
It's Choi Yeong-min.

150
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,341
He knows Captain Jang.

151
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,510
Even though we interviewed him.

152
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,972
Maybe he met him around this building.

153
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,810
I don't think that's the case.
It sounded like he'd known him a while.

154
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,772
What are you trying to say?

155
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,528
Something doesn't feel right.

156
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,613
Maybe he's hiding something more.

157
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,617
If he were to hide things,
he wouldn't have submitted the evidence.

158
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,041
Why do you keep doing this?

159
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,335
What do you mean?

160
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,213
You're defending Captain Jang again.

161
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,591
I'm not defending him.

162
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,801
There's no reason to suspect him.

163
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,012
Even when there was a reason,
you overlooked it.

164
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:45,475
When he hid what he knew about
his daughter, why did you side with him?

165
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,353
Captain!

166
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,609
Yes. Will do.

167
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,363
Yes.

168
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,451
I'll call you when I head out.

169
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,844
Hey.

170
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:24,348
Captain Jang,
the skeleton turned out to be

171
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,766
Lee Su-hyeon.

172
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,687
The DNA test result we just got says
that her father's and its DNA

173
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,398
do match.

174
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,954
I submitted your key chain as evidence.

175
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:38,046
It's been confirmed
you were at Mount Daehwa that day.

176
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,306
And we found

177
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,810
Lee Su-hyeon's DNA on it.

178
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,063
What's your point?

179
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,025
Lee Su-hyeon, the dead girl.

180
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,863
And the key chain she gave to you.

181
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,327
Didn't you know Lee Su-hyeon died?

182
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,582
Why did she die?

183
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:21,923
That's it?

184
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,886
You really didn't know she died?

185
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,682
Do you think I killed her too?

186
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,853
Whatever the truth is,

187
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,398
the police will start
investigating this soon.

188
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,696
When they check her call logs
or talk to the school,

189
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,575
your name will come up.

190
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,041
Once they find out
that you knew both of the victims,

191
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,504
they will reinvestigate
the Song Min-a case.

192
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,090
So?

193
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,093
What are you trying to say?

194
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:11,848
Lee Su-hyeon.

195
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,726
We finally managed
to identify the skeleton.

196
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,731
Who submitted this evidence, by the way?

197
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,608
I don't know.

198
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:31,576
Captain, here are Lee Su-hyeon's call logs
and criminal record.

199
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,619
Look at this.

200
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,748
Hey.

201
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,459
Get the car ready. Now.

202
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,885
Tell the police

203
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,722
that you sent the key chain.

204
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,559
To turn myself in?

205
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,894
That's your best bet.

206
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:00,981
Turning yourself in is the only way

207
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,400
to reduce your charges.

208
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,153
You said you trust me.

209
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:08,530
I submitted it
because I didn't want to doubt you.

210
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,410
I wanted to see it for myself

211
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,665
to believe you.

212
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,585
You don't

213
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,505
believe what you see.
You see what you believe.

214
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,676
And that's who you believe I am.

215
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,471
We don't have time. The lawyer's waiting.

216
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,483
What now? Are you going to handcuff me?

217
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,448
You have to turn yourself in

218
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,825
before the investigation starts.

219
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,056
I'll get changed first.
Wait for me in the car.

220
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:34,282
CRIMINAL BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS DIVISION
JANG TAE-SU

221
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:39,412
This means the culprit knew
both Lee Su-hyeon and Song Min-a.

222
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,915
This can't be just a coincidence.

223
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,794
Did you ask the precinct for backup?

224
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,128
Yes, they'll be here soon.

225
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:10,819
Excuse me.

226
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,363
What's going on?

227
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:14,572
We've received a report.

228
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,658
Who made the report?

229
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,120
Ms. Jang Ha-bin reported
domestic violence.

230
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,790
She said that you obsessively suspect her.

231
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,083
That's my daughter.

232
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,584
-Jang Ha-bin.
-Sir.

233
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,713
Did you know that your daughter
ran into a car due to severe distress?

234
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:30,839
-It's not true.
-Wait--

235
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,465
-Let me talk to my daughter.
-Wait.

236
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,968
We've already confirmed
these facts with the hospital.

237
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,094
And the case report too.

238
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,471
-Just one minute.
-Sorry, you can't do that.

239
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,849
-Jang Ha-bin!
-Please calm down, sir.

240
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:44,352
Your daughter is suicidal right now.

241
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,271
-No, that's not--
-No!

242
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:47,397
Please excuse me.

243
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,524
-Jang Ha-bin.
-Please, sir.

244
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:51,484
Sir. Please calm down.

245
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,236
Officer Choi, give him a moment.

246
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:12,964
Get out of the car now.

247
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:14,966
You've lost your mind.

248
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,219
Running away won't solve anything.
Come on out.

249
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,262
Dad.

250
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,308
Are you so sure?

251
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,603
How can you be so sure?

252
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:30,982
Let's talk out here.

253
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,651
Have you ever asked me

254
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:36,404
why I'm doing this?

255
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,747
You can drag me to the police,
but I won't turn myself in.

256
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:50,919
If you want to put me in prison so badly,
get an arrest warrant.

257
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,183
-Enough is enough.
-We're not here because of Song Min-a.

258
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,310
You know Lee Su-hyeon?

259
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,232
She was in the runaway gang. Lee Su-hyeon.

260
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,571
-Who is she?
-Don't act like you don't know.

261
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,866
The record says she was charged
in the same case.

262
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:06,953
We need to interview you guys too.
Get ready and follow us.

263
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,708
I don't know who Lee Su-hyeon is.

264
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,838
So keep your mouths shut.

265
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,341
Run your mouth,
and you'll end up like that.

266
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,202
That's Captain Jang.

267
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,661
I'll go get the kids.

268
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,248
-Move faster.
-Come on.

269
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:55,543
Lee Su-hyeon was in Choi Yeong-min's gang?

270
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,378
I just called you to share the new info.

271
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,131
You can't come here
in the middle of the audit.

272
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,758
Are you sure she was?

273
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:04,135
His reaction shows
there's definitely something.

274
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,722
Both victims were
in the same runaway gang.

275
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,557
All we need now is hard evidence.

276
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,519
So don't cause trouble and go.

277
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,522
-You're taking us again?
-Hurry up.

278
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,982
But we didn't do anything.

279
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,109
Be quiet and follow us.

280
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,319
Come on. Hurry up.

281
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:24,030
Make sure they don't talk to each other
on the way.

282
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,573
Come on. Go.

283
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,783
Go sit in the back.

284
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,118
Why is one missing?

285
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,373
Before, we interrogated seven kids.

286
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,375
You think I'm their dad?

287
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,211
That kid must be out somewhere.

288
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,420
What…

289
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,632
We'll check at the station
and let you know.

290
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,534
Have you seen this girl?

291
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,244
Her name is Lee Su-hyeon.

292
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,204
I'm not sure.

293
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,373
Who is she?

294
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,709
She's a runaway girl.

295
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,795
She lived in this basement last year.

296
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,550
Now that I think about it,
she does look familiar.

297
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,564
What's your relationship
with Choi Yeong-min?

298
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,191
He's just

299
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,069
my tenant.

300
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,697
Have you ever met him

301
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,782
or spoken with him personally?

302
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,203
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

303
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,501
They have become
significantly uncooperative.

304
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,253
It's obvious.

305
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,463
It's Choi Yeong-min's doing.

306
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:31,467
Are you sure the girl named Eun-jin
wasn't in the house?

307
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:34,345
They said she never came home.
She wouldn't answer her phone either.

308
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,807
Eun-jin made some statements
against Choi Yeong-min.

309
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:42,145
I'm worried he may have
gotten back at her.

310
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:45,606
All right.

311
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,401
We shouldn't only deal
with the runaway kids.

312
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,528
Let's look into other people
in Lee Su-hyeon's circle.

313
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:54,532
She stopped using her phone two years ago,
so it'll be hard to find her circle.

314
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:58,161
But kids these days
can't live without phones.

315
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,913
Anyway, go through the school,

316
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,624
the house, and the neighborhood
first thing tomorrow.

317
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,752
If we keep searching,

318
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:08,212
we'll come across at least
one person who remembers her.

319
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,156
CHOI YEONG-MIN

320
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:38,659
The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable

321
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,787
and your call has been forwarded
to their voicemail.

322
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,331
Call charges will apply after the beep.

323
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:10,274
Ha-bin doesn't want to come out.

324
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:14,195
I have something I must ask her.

325
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,988
I understand your situation,

326
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,825
but you can't do that at this hour.

327
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,828
I know it's usually not allowed,

328
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,123
but could you please help me out?

329
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,334
We should respect Ha-bin's opinion.

330
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,837
I'm sorry.

331
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,058
Have you ever asked me

332
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,519
why I'm doing this?

333
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,675
You can return to the investigation now.

334
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,262
And this fundamentally
contradicts the report,

335
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,764
so the case is closed.

336
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,393
Do we know who the informant was?

337
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,062
I didn't hear anything about that.

338
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,856
Do you have someone specific in mind?

339
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,318
No.

340
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:26,953
Captain Jang.

341
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,539
I heard you were cleared
of the allegations.

342
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,461
How did Choi Yeong-min's interrogation go?

343
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:37,797
That little brat.

344
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,633
He blabbered nonsense to Officer Gu

345
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:44,178
and he completely ignored Officer Lee.

346
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:47,306
Anyway, this is great.
Join me for his interrogation.

347
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,186
-Where are you going?
-Bathroom.

348
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,814
That bastard…

349
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,399
-Don't take too long.
-Yes, sir.

350
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,456
Do you know Ha-bin?

351
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:14,792
She's your daughter, right?

352
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:17,670
Ji-yeon told me.

353
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:25,428
How do you know Ha-bin?

354
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:26,554
That's a good question.

355
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:29,890
I'm curious myself.

356
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,060
Why is your daughter so obsessed with me?

357
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,276
Whatever.

358
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,866
Other detectives don't know, right?

359
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,578
That your daughter

360
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,247
killed Min-a.

361
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,210
Can I go home now?

362
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,087
Can I?

363
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,508
What if I let something slip
because I'm tired?

364
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,987
INTERROGATION ROOM

365
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:39,960
Lee Su-hyeon.

366
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,755
When did she join your gang?

367
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:48,052
Was it sometime last year?

368
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,179
Was it during the winter?

369
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:55,017
-When did you last see her?
-Or summer?

370
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,314
You have to be specific.

371
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:04,026
Innocent people are cooperative
during interrogations.

372
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:10,491
She joined us early last year
and then left around the summer.

373
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,453
She left without saying anything,

374
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,372
so I didn't really care.

375
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,124
The estimated time of her death

376
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:22,420
is right around when you last saw her.

377
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,382
You can't drag me into it

378
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,802
just because we lived in
the same house for a bit.

379
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:35,724
Lee Su-hyeon's body was found.

380
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,688
A victim's corpse reveals
the most about the culprit.

381
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,607
And I'm saying we found it.

382
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:51,866
To be fair, it shouldn't be surprising
to find anything of mine on her body.

383
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:54,994
As you know,

384
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,580
we've lived together.

385
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,958
It depends on what was found.

386
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,380
Did we find anything on her body?

387
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,383
No. He didn't tell us anything about it.

388
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,178
You know what, Mister?

389
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:17,558
The thing is…

390
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,978
I don't care about Lee Su-hyeon,

391
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,147
but I wonder who killed Min-a.

392
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,941
I'm really curious.

393
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:33,699
You know Park Ji-yeon, right?

394
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,538
She was close with Min-a.

395
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,666
And she said something strange to me.

396
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:44,752
Is that so?

397
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,674
She said something strange to me too.
It was about you.

398
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,303
She said that

399
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:56,805
you completely lose your temper
and get violent

400
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,432
when things don't go your way.

401
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:02,061
I think I know the reason
why Song Min-a and Park Ji-yeon

402
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:04,522
left you.

403
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,487
Looks like that bitch still spits out lies

404
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,031
every time she opens her mouth.

405
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:16,575
Choi Yeong-min.

406
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:21,956
The kids just won't listen to you, right?

407
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:27,711
Even though you keep a roof over
their heads and beat them up.

408
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,422
It's not a surprise.

409
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:34,343
Who would want to be around you?

410
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:38,264
You're an animal
who can't control his emotions.

411
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,432
Stop it.

412
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,603
Just like your father,

413
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:47,690
you're scared.

414
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,236
You're afraid the kids might leave you.

415
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,156
Just like

416
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,410
your mother.

417
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,456
Shut your mouth.

418
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:18,971
Is that why you beat Lee Su-hyeon too?

419
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,853
Who's the bitch
who told you this nonsense?

420
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:30,107
-Do you have any proof I beat them?
-I told you.

421
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:34,111
We found the body,
which reveals the most about the culprit.

422
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:35,738
The bruises all over.

423
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:40,743
Ridiculous.

424
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,330
There were bruises?

425
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,084
After being buried for a year?

426
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:53,255
How did you know that?

427
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,426
You told me yourself

428
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,095
that she died last summer.

429
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:04,433
I never said she was buried.

430
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:11,273
I said we found the body.

431
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,571
You killed

432
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:21,909
Lee Su-hyeon, didn't you?

433
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:33,545
-And he hasn't said a word since?
-Yes.

434
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,172
I get what you're trying to say.

435
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,383
But we can't arrest him with that.

436
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,802
If we release him now,

437
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:43,430
he's likely to make plans to flee.

438
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,723
I know. That's why

439
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:47,351
I want you to find hard evidence

440
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:48,977
and make him confess.

441
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:52,523
Release him
and watch him closely at the stakeout.

442
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,907
Oh, great. It's always that darn evidence.

443
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,956
Choi Yeong-min.

444
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,249
Come out.

445
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:29,017
The cops asked me about Lee Su-hyeon.

446
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,437
-Perhaps--
-They found the body.

447
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,896
What do we do now?

448
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:35,315
What if they…

449
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,109
Min-a is dead too.

450
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,948
So we just need to keep quiet.

451
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,117
That girl was following
Min-a around, right?

452
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,910
You don't know how much she knows.

453
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:50,539
And she's a cop's daughter.

454
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,627
That bitch is the one who killed Min-a.

455
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:59,381
But I can't snitch on her
because she has my money.

456
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,676
Damn it.

457
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:15,105
I'll do whatever it takes
to get the money back.

458
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,359
Let's leave this place.

459
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:27,451
Did she really say she'll give you
the money back when you meet her?

460
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:30,496
Whatever.
I'm getting the fucking money back.

461
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,085
You'll come, right?

462
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,630
Of course.

463
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:45,052
How are you going to meet her?

464
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,180
The cops are watching you.

465
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:49,640
God damn it.

466
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:54,436
So she was expelled for too many absences.

467
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:56,313
That's right.

468
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:58,857
Do you remember anything about her?

469
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,567
She was in the track and field club.

470
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,737
She tried so hard
despite her financial difficulties.

471
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,782
Then she got injured
and she was devastated.

472
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:10,494
That's about the time
she stopped coming to school.

473
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:16,416
Did Su-hyeon have any friends
who can give us more details about her?

474
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:24,758
Well, not that I can remember.

475
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:25,676
There's no one?

476
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,554
Yes, she was a very quiet girl.

477
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:31,890
By the way,

478
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:36,353
did you find any clues
about who did that to Su-hyeon?

479
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,773
We're still figuring it out.

480
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:47,299
I get why Su-hyeon ran away from home.

481
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:55,140
This a typical scene of domestic abuse.

482
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:59,102
Looks like she was a talented runner.

483
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,604
She's received a lot of awards.

484
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,321
Wait. It looks almost exactly the same

485
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:11,365
as the evidence Captain Jang submitted.

486
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,449
Right?

487
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:17,871
I wonder who sent the evidence.

488
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:21,708
It couldn't have been Lee Su-hyeon
since she's dead.

489
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:23,460
You're right.

490
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,213
Officer Lee.

491
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:27,798
Could you take a look at this?

492
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,549
Sure.

493
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,051
Here.

494
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,688
Meet me tonight.

495
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,065
What's your deal?

496
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,067
You'll know once you meet me.

497
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:50,654
Like father, like daughter.
Your whole family is nuts.

498
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:53,240
-If you don't want the money, hang up.
-Hey.

499
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:00,831
-I can't because of the cops.
-Just do as I say.

500
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,208
I can make the cops go away.

501
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:04,418
How?

502
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:11,258
Officer Lee, you head back first.

503
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,217
Why?

504
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,469
I want to check out
Choi Yeong-min's house.

505
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:18,181
I still can't get in touch with Eun-jin.

506
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:22,769
So it's not for work,
but purely out of concern?

507
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,856
She trusted me and told me the truth.

508
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:31,194
I don't want her to be in trouble
because of that.

509
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:33,196
You seem to forget your place sometimes.

510
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,490
You're a police officer.

511
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:38,910
And it was your job
to ask her those questions.

512
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:44,166
But this is weighing on me.
I've got to do something about it.

513
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,710
Why did you even become a police officer?

514
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:52,257
There are tons of other jobs
where you can always be a good person.

515
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,052
Am I doing something wrong here?

516
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:59,514
Officer Gu, aren't you scared?

517
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:03,852
In the job we do,

518
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,855
even the tiniest mistake

519
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:10,650
can lead to serious consequences.

520
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,874
AMBULANCE

521
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:26,875
What was that?

522
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:34,132
Captain, something happened here.

523
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:35,383
I'll check and get back to you.

524
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:36,968
Call off the stakeout team.

525
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:40,722
Sir, Choi Yeong-min isn't the type
to attempt suicide.

526
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:43,016
Yes. He didn't even take
that many sleeping pills.

527
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:46,144
-Detective Cho checked with the hospital--
-He's hiring a lawyer.

528
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,729
Call them off before it gets any worse.

529
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,898
-He's putting on a show--
-It's a fact

530
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:52,317
that we pushed him without any evidence.

531
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,236
Go find the evidence.
That's all we can do.

532
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:16,860
Hi.

533
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:20,906
Do you live here?

534
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,160
Yes, upstairs.

535
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,204
I'm a police officer.

536
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:30,332
Can I ask you something?

537
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:33,627
-Are you going somewhere?
-Yes.

538
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,463
Can I ask you one question?

539
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:40,008
Do you know this girl
who lives in the basement here?

540
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:44,763
Have you seen her today or yesterday?

541
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:53,021
Can I ask you one more question?

542
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,273
Do you know this girl?

543
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:02,948
Do you?

544
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,995
What's wrong?

545
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,167
Eun-jin.

546
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,878
Eun-jin, what happened to your face?

547
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:18,213
Please leave.

548
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:19,589
Eun-jin, wait.

549
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,427
-Did Choi Yeong-min do this?
-No. Now leave.

550
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,346
Wait, Eun-jin.

551
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,723
Before you go in, let's report this first.

552
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:30,892
I'll find a place for you to stay--

553
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,687
Could you please stop
making promises you can't keep?

554
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:38,358
I don't need your cheap pity.

555
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,968
-Oh, I know her.
-Do you know her?

556
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:08,304
Someone was looking for her for a while.

557
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:11,516
He told me to call him if I ever see her.

558
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:15,311
He's been looking for her
desperately for months.

559
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,606
Do you have his contact info?

560
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,776
The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable

561
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,862
and your call has been forwarded
to their voicemail.

562
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,864
Call charges will apply after the beep.

563
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:26,990
It's so strange.

564
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:29,034
When I called the school,
they said he left already.

565
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:32,787
He was her homeroom teacher.

566
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,789
Maybe he was looking for her
because she ran away.

567
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,959
Come on. What kind of teacher
searches for their missing student

568
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,669
for months?

569
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:42,797
Right. It's unreasonable
to do it for months.

570
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:45,633
If my kids disappear
and their homeroom teacher does that,

571
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:48,386
I'd be suspicious, not grateful.

572
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,390
Choi Yeong-min isn't in the hospital now.

573
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,228
YEONJU HANGUK HOSPITAL

574
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,932
We have footage of him taking a taxi

575
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,642
but we can't see the license plate.

576
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:19,894
I requested the control center
to track him.

577
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,813
Search everywhere he could go.

578
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,356
-Yes, sir.
-Update me every hour.

579
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,274
Yes, sir.

580
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:25,567
He took a taxi?

581
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:27,777
Captain Oh.

582
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,656
We found this in Lee Su-hyeon's house.

583
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:33,825
What's this?

584
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,285
The face is scratched off.

585
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,912
Did we locate Choi Yeong-min?

586
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:39,831
We're still working on it.

587
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,876
Who do you think this is?
It was found in Lee Su-hyeon's house.

588
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,713
Is she from the same gang?

589
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:50,341
I don't think so. The date written on it
is before she joined the gang.

590
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:53,887
I think we should identify this girl too.

591
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:02,187
You said Lee Su-hyeon didn't have a phone.

592
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,229
Right.

593
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:07,901
Hold on. She has a phone here.

594
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:12,363
It could be someone else's phone.

595
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:14,949
If it's not hers or her parents'…

596
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,160
Who would buy her a phone?

597
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:27,795
Seong-hui.

598
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:34,469
I told you not to come. It's dangerous.

599
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:36,554
The cops came to school.

600
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:41,434
-Do you think they're suspecting you?
-No, not yet.

601
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:44,771
Did Choi Yeong-min say anything?

602
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:49,442
He doesn't know anything yet.

603
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:56,074
I'm sorry to put you through this.

604
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:03,081
Don't worry, Jun-tae.

605
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:06,417
Everything will be all right.

606
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:29,148
It's me. Jang Tae-su.
Can I ask you a favor?

607
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:34,362
Can you find the number
that was called most frequently last year?

608
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,031
Yes.

609
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,743
The name is Jang Ha-bin.

610
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:12,900
How did she know this place?

611
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:07,705
Seriously, who are you?

612
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:09,832
How do you know this place?

613
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,547
What do you want?

614
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:20,301
Fuck! You must be doing this for a reason.

615
01:01:20,968 --> 01:01:21,886
Reason?

616
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:24,013
You already know.

617
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:28,976
Is this because of Lee Su-hyeon?

618
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:35,024
What's your relationship with her?

619
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,491
How do you know her?

620
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:46,160
What kind of nonsense is this now?

621
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:48,413
Hey.

622
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:50,873
Stop beating around the bush
and get to the point.

623
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,084
If it isn't about Lee Su-hyeon, why…

624
01:02:12,603 --> 01:02:13,646
I get it now.

625
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,008
Yes?

626
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:46,012
Jang Ha-bin contacted
these two numbers frequently last year.

627
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:47,680
And they're under the same name.

628
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:51,142
What? What do you mean?

629
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:55,271
Both numbers are registered
under someone named Yoon Ji-su.

630
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:57,607
What?

631
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:01,194
Both numbers are Yoon Ji-su's?

632
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:03,905
Send me the numbers.

633
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:13,122

636
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:01,921
You're that lady's daughter, aren't you?

637
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:04,173
You look like her.

638
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:09,262
Are you taking revenge on us

639
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,890
because we threatened your mom
for some money?

640
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:14,267
Is that what this is about?

641
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,520
And that's why you killed Song Min-a.

642
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:23,526
Jeez, you're one scary bitch.

643
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,654
I feel bad for you though.

644
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:31,200
You just became a murderer
without knowing anything.

645
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:34,036
Tell me why you threatened her.

646
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:39,876
-You really want to know?
-Answer my question.

647
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:42,920
Or I'll kill you.

648
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:50,678
You know what?

649
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:53,306
Don't regret this later.

650
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,018
You asked for it.

651
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,118
Why did Ji-su…

652
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:54,445
Mom.

653
01:09:09,436 --> 01:09:13,190
What… What is this?

654
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:18,988
He's obsessively suspicious
of his daughter.

655
01:09:19,071 --> 01:09:20,072
Captain Jang?

656
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:22,783
About Lee Su-hyeon…

01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:24,243
PROFILER JANG TAE-SU

658
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:25,911
What was her relationship with Ha-bin?

659
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:29,540
Happy birthday dear Ha-bin

660
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:31,959
Why did Su-hyeon die?

661
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:33,460
Answer me!

662
01:09:34,086 --> 01:09:35,045
I want Ha-bin
