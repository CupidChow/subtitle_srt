1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,370
(Previously)
I knew what was going on between you and Put.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:03,780
Actually,

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,680
I really wished that you wouldn't
have chosen the second restaurant.

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,810
I used to go there with
my ex two years ago.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,030
- Hey Jeng.
- Hey.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:14,950
Mr. Jeng,

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,640
you have so many friends, don't you?

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,150
You always meet your
friends here and there.

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,550
That guy, he's my ex.

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,420
Mr. Jeng, you like guys.

11
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,200
You like guys?

12
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,360
(Chot: Pat? Why didn't you come to work?)

13
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,100
(Pat: Can I have a day off?)

14
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,140
(Mr. Jeng: Absolutely Fine,
Take your time.)

15
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:25,960
Mom.

16
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,720
Hi, son.

17
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,690
How was your sleep.

18
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,900
Like a baby.

19
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,990
I've missed you so much!

20
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,240
- I also missed you!
- I missed you so much.

21
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,320
Hey, are you getting too skinny?

22
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,620
I don't think so.

23
00:03:49,517 --> 00:03:55,267
Last night you were wrecked!
What did you do?

24
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,110
- Last night?
- Yeah.

25
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,320
Bathroom! Bathroom!

26
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,160
Oh my!

27
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,230
Oh my! Oh my!

28
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,620
It's burning! What will I do now!

29
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:26,740
♪ I don't have to be lonely any more
When you're here ♪

30
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,160
♪ Keep taking care of me like this... forever. ♪

31
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,070
♪ I don't have to be afraid of anything. ♪

32
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,170
♪ Please stay with me a little longer. ♪

33
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,280
♪ Please don't leave me just yet. ♪

34
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,680
♪ Cuz baby you're my sunshine, alright ♪

35
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,240
♪ You were like a breath of fresh air. ♪

36
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:08,190
♪ I cannot live... Without you. ♪

37
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,310
It's all done!

38
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,290
Hey...

39
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:21,980
Oh wow.

40
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,940
You shouldn't be eating
instant noodles for breakfast,

41
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,380
it's not good for your health.

42
00:05:31,677 --> 00:05:32,927
It's been a long time.

43
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,070
I don't eat it everyday.

44
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:38,640
You're so adorable.

45
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,160
It's so good!

46
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,750
Eat up! Eat up!

47
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,210
It's yummy.

48
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:57,340
Pat.

49
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,210
The friend who dropped you off last night.

50
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,820
Was he your friend?

51
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,780
The friend who dropped me off?

52
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:06,800
Yeah.

53
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,400
The person last night, Jeng,

54
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,950
he said you were his friend.

55
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,220
He said he was my friend?

56
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,040
Yeah, when he picked up his phone

57
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,580
he said he was your friend.

58
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:28,140
I called you so many times
and you didn't even answer my texts.

59
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,440
You were actually being someone else's burden.

60
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,460
I had to hurry to get you home.

61
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,190
You're nagging.

62
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,070
Just eat.

63
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,370
Oh, but your friend from last night.

64
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:49,950
He's handsome,

65
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,620
polite,

66
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,580
and has great manners.

67
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,220
He also smells great!

68
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,890
Where did you meet him?
Why don't I know him?

69
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,220
Uh.

70
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,870
I don't want to talk anymore,
don't you have a doctor's appointment?

71
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,410
You won't get there in time.

72
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,570
Hmm, you're changing subjects.

73
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,180
Hmm, it's so good!

74
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,420
Eat up honey.

75
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,790
I don't think I can leave the Digital
department anytime soon.

76
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,830
By the end of this year,
if nothing changes.

77
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,370
Then everything goes as promised.

78
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:53,950
Jian Group has the money

79
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,040
to immediately outsource the work.

80
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,160
(Mr. Jeng: Absolutely Fine,
Take your time.)

81
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,370
Honestly, these past fews days all
I can think of is you.

82
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,090
I'm waiting for the moment

83
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,520
that I can confess to you
and ask you to be my boyfriend.

84
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,470
I never knew that I was
making you uncomfortable.

85
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,350
For me, now it's not important whether

86
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,960
we can be lovers or not.

87
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,140
I just want you to feel comfortable
with me.

88
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,140
At least I'm a safe space for you.

89
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,480
That's already enough for me.

90
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,920
I won't do anything anymore,

91
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,210
I promise.

92
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,220
The person just now is my ex-boyfriend.

93
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,680
That joke was not funny.

94
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,720
I wasn't joking.

95
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,390
Mr. Jeng.

96
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,680
Likes men?

97
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:22,880
- Chot.
- Oh my!

98
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,450
Oh! Mr. Jeng!

99
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,120
You scared the life out of me!

100
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,460
I'm sorry.

101
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:30,910
Have you seen Pat?

102
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,600
I think he's taken the day off today.

103
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,410
- He's taken the day off?
- Yes.

104
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,690
He didn't inform me.

105
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,220
Uh...

106
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,890
Please excuse me.

107
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,310
Could you straighten that?

108
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:03,900
Yeah.

109
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:06,580
That's good.

110
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,950
Are the fonts different

111
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,580
or are they different sizes?

112
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,590
Sure.

113
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,020
I usually use this font.

114
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,960
Can you look it over?

115
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,570
Okay, uh, what?

116
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:43,170
Let me see.
Can you use this font?

117
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,150
That's great. That's great.

118
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,640
Dad.

119
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:33,950
Are you ok?

120
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,930
I'm ok.

121
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,610
Why are you carrying
so much stuff this time?

122
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,520
I'm also here for a holiday

123
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,150
so I brought more stuff.

124
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:56,040
I wish I could take a holiday.

125
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,480
I just got the chance to take a day off.

126
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,100
Hey, it's pretty weird.

127
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:01,960
What?

128
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:05,440
Mom was here the other day
and now you're here.

129
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,040
Did you guys plan on meeting up?

130
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,870
What?

131
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,510
I come around this time every year,

132
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,300
don't you remember?

133
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,040
It's almost your birthday.

134
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,030
Huh?

135
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:17,780
Uh.

136
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,960
It's almost my birthday?

137
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,960
Eh, you don't remember
your own birthday anymore?

138
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,110
What, you can't remember your own birthday?

139
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,970
Huh, what's the smell?

140
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,860
Hey, dad.

141
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:33,310
What?

142
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,010
I forgot, I was boiling some noodles.

143
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,470
Oh.

144
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:39,800
What?

145
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,670
Oh.

146
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:42,750
What's wrong?

147
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,170
It's all goopy.

148
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,470
Woah.

149
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,280
Huh.

150
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,320
Life must be pretty hard lately.

151
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,370
Well...

152
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,600
Do you want me to make you some?

153
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,420
It's a pity.

154
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,440
I boiled 2 whole packets.

155
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,060
But I want to eat your cooking.

156
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,310
I'll make something for you, go.

157
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,880
Let's see.

158
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,600
All done.

159
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,160
Gravy fried crispy noodles.

160
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,950
It looks so good!

161
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,580
Let me take a picture first.

162
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:29,710
Dad, you hold it too.

163
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:30,410
Huh?

164
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,660
Take a picture with me too.

165
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,530
Sure.

166
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,230
Take a selfie.

167
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,320
One. Two. Three.

168
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,790
Ok.

169
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,350
Can't eat if you don't post it.

170
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,420
Tell them.

171
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,720
Gravy fried crispy noodles from Chef.

172
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,740
Chef Thanet.

173
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,750
Chef Bah!

174
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,190
- Chef Bah, ok.
- Um.

175
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,700
I'm going to eat now.

176
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,750
Go ahead!

177
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,120
What?
Why are you moving your head like that?

178
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,280
It's so good!

179
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,560
Of course.

180
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,560
Have you been starving?

181
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,070
Ever since I came to live in this house

182
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,970
and not with Grandma, I always
have to find food to eat myself.

183
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,200
If I don't order delivery,
I have to buy it from outside.

184
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,910
Or I just make noodles.

185
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:28,090
Then why don't you try to learn
how to make a simple dish?

186
00:16:28,426 --> 00:16:30,436
Let's start with egg dishes
first, something like this.

187
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,910
Oh Dad, if I could do it,
I would have already done it.

188
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,900
I even burn the fried eggs.

189
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,626
You burnt that?

190
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,390
Of course.

191
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,070
Oh, why does life fail like this, Pat?

192
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,880
That's harsh.

193
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:52,940
How about I teach you while I'm here?

194
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,960
You won't scold my like
the chefs on the TV shows right?

195
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,780
Hey, I'm not scary,
but I'll scold you.

196
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,130
Go get the raw materials,
where did the food scraps

197
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,650
come from to make food for me to eat?

198
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,210
That's why the taste is so disgusting,
Mr. Pat?

199
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,020
Dad.

200
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,020
You're so adorable.

201
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,050
Eat up.

202
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,120
Do you want some?

203
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,900
I'm too scared to eat my own food.

204
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,680
Oh.

205
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,160
If I eat it, I'd be like,
oh why is it so good!

206
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,370
It's be patting myself on the back.

207
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,800
- Chef Code of Conduct.
- Yes.

208
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,570
Pat, I'll be filling
in for Mr. Jeng today. He's busy.

209
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,240
After checking the double head,

210
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,530
do you want to go grab some food?

211
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,542
(DOUBLE HEAD: check the work
by agencies and brand owners)

212
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,080
There's a place I like going with Krit.

213
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,160
It's near his house,
I'll pay for the meal.

214
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,930
Hey, let me tell you something.

215
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,040
Krit's family works as civil servants.

216
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,050
And Krit is a lawyer.

217
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:42,630
Being gay is something that
his family is really against.

218
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,080
Here.

219
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:57,100
Even though he's asked me to be his
fiance and promised to be with me forever.

220
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,380
But he's still too scared
to tell his family that he's dating me.

221
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,020
But at least he's straight forward
with showing you that he loves you.

222
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,470
I think that's the most important thing.

223
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,050
Um...

224
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,000
Thanks Pat.

225
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:25,210
I don't know what's bothering you.

226
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,690
But if you're comfortable to say it,
you can tell me.

227
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,610
It's ok, it'll pass.

228
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,730
That's what you always say, it'll pass.

229
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,670
Let's get back to work.

230
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:57,370
Thanks.

231
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,030
Here's yours, with no nuts.

232
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,570
You really know me.

233
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,990
Do you really want me to overlook
the Digital Department?

234
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:07,350
Yeah,

235
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,060
I've set it up a while ago.

236
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:13,340
And most managers
really don't stay for long.

237
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,410
They don't have any
performance to show for.

238
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,080
But I haven't worked
for a salary in such a long time.

239
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,710
It's kind of hard for me to go back.

240
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,830
But if you want me as a consultant,
that would be easy.

241
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,070
Do you have anyone you could refer?

242
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,240
Hmm...

243
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,550
This makes me think of the brownies
you made in New York,

244
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:38,940
do you remember that party at Tae's place?

245
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:43,400
There is.

246
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,880
But I don't think anybody is good enough for you.

247
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,540
Even me.

248
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,610
I didn't even think you'd think of me.

249
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,910
But, I have an idea.

250
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,250
Just train someone in your department.

251
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,850
Give them a scholarship to intern somewhere.

252
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:07,040
Find someone you trust,
it might take some time.

253
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,740
But at least you get to be
with the department you started.

254
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,660
There should be some changes.

255
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:17,280
So you don't look like a boss
who mixes personal matters with work.

256
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,300
Do I look like a boss that doesn't
have that much responsibility?

257
00:21:27,483 --> 00:21:29,783
No, it depends on how you look at it.

258
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,060
Some people may be responsible for the job

259
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,000
but not interested in others.

260
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:39,600
Or perhaps not taking responsibility
for themsleves, like a selfish person.

261
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,770
But in the end, what I'm saying is.

262
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,286
There's always different
ways of looking at it.

263
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,430
Thank you very much.

264
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,440
I'm going now, see you.

265
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,670
See you soon, thank you very much.

266
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,930
You should just learn
how to trust other people.

267
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,220
I'm going, see you.

268
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,260
Toh.

269
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,350
I would like you to inform Ms.Dear
that I'd like to postpone today's meeting.

270
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,680
Thank you.

271
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,060
It's so cold.

272
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,900
Of course it is,
what temp is the aircon at?!

273
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,750
Oh, it's so hot.

274
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,300
You're wearing long sleeves like this.

275
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:18,970
Hello.

276
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,260
We can go together.

277
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,040
Yeah.

278
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,080
Hello.

279
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:28,970
- Hello.
- Hello. Mr. Jeng.

280
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,200
Here.

281
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,670
It's ok.

282
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,150
Huh?

283
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,760
Should I?

284
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,480
Well, it's cold.

285
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,070
Thank you.

286
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,950
I think Chot might be colder.

287
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,750
Ok.

288
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:18,820
Pat.

289
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,750
May I speak to you?

290
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,360
Did I make you uncomfortable in any way?

291
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,530
No.

292
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,830
I'm just tired.

293
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:55,980
Oh.

294
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,730
Is it my fault?

295
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,230
No.

296
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,270
I'm sorry.

297
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,480
Why are you saying sorry to me?

298
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,740
When I said it wasn't your fault.

299
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,590
You didn't answer my text,
ever since that day.

300
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:28,640
Mr. Jeng.

301
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,760
Could you stop texting me?

302
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,910
If it's not work related.

303
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,010
Don't invite me to go eat.

304
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,000
Don't drop me off home.

305
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,630
I really want to thank you.

306
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,920
Thank you for everything.

307
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,280
But please don't do it again.

308
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,740
Especially in front of everyone.

309
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,440
I can't say no.

310
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,080
Pat.

311
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,360
Please don't do that to me again.

312
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,300
I like you.

313
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,360
I really like you.

314
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,620
What are you saying?

315
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,170
How could you like me?

316
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,550
It doesn't make sense.

317
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,590
You should get back to work.

318
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,440
Pat.

319
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,180
Tell me everything between you and Pat,

320
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,110
I know it's not just work related.

321
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,480
I saw Pat cry after talking to you.

322
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,930
But I saw you go so many places together
all the time.

323
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:53,520
And the BTS photos of Fjord.

324
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,500
You're always together.

325
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,280
Huh?

326
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,180
Well?

327
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,680
He only thinks of me as a co-worker.

328
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,520
But I can't stop my feelings
and thoughts that go beyond that.

329
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,370
It's like I'm going down a rabbit hole

330
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:28,570
and I can't find my way out.

331
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,160
Every second of the day,
all I can think about is Pat.

332
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,730
I like Pat.

333
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,490
I like Pat so much.

334
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,160
But our relationship right now...

335
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,960
It can't make our love happen at all.

336
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,150
I don't know what to do.

337
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,230
Brother.

338
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,110
Brother.

339
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,650
I can handle it.

340
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,810
I think I can.

341
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,080
I'm fine.

342
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,460
I understand.

343
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,560
You can cry,
people are allowed to be weak.

344
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,150
You've done so well.

345
00:32:13,045 --> 00:32:15,185
- The veggies are here.
- Can I have some mussels?

346
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:15,640
Huh?

347
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,360
Mussels, mussels, mussels.

348
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:18,170
- Mussels, okay.
- I'm sorry.

349
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,040
- What is this?
- Honey, eat a lot.

350
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,680
So who gets up? Me.

351
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,320
Here, take this.

352
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,690
Come on, let's raise a glass.

353
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,320
Come come come.

354
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:39,080
Oh my gosh, let's get together with pork.

355
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,600
Today is a feast day.

356
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,280
Um.

357
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,720
Good luck to our Jen.

358
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,580
Hey!

359
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,070
Come on.

360
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,750
Raise a toast to Jen.

361
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,960
I think it's because of Jarb.

362
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:58,950
That's why is face is like that.

363
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:01,610
Pat, go talk to him.

364
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,430
You want to eat.

365
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:09,810
Ah, this is for you.

366
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,110
Thanks Pat.

367
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:13,800
Sit down.

368
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:14,860
Thanks.

369
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,800
You don't have to be so polite,
we've worked so much together.

370
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:28,920
When are you coming back?

371
00:33:30,893 --> 00:33:32,273
We hardly got the chance to talk.

372
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,470
That's true.

373
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:36,920
I have no idea.

374
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,450
I think I need to wait to clear my head.

375
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:47,380
I can't focus on work at all.

376
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:50,590
That's so nice,

377
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,220
I wish I had a home
in another province to go back to.

378
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,240
If you are free,
you can come to visit my house.

379
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:00,530
Sure.

380
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,230
It's not very pretty.

381
00:34:03,873 --> 00:34:09,233
But it's a safe zone for me.

382
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:16,080
Even if there is nothing for me
to follow my dreams.

383
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,960
What do you mean?

384
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,420
Well, everything is here.

385
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:34,170
And look at how bad it is.

386
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,330
Are you ok?

387
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,250
I'm fine.

388
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:47,080
Why is your face like that?
We will rest tomorrow.

389
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,010
But Pat? How are you?

390
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:58,930
I don't know,

391
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,230
now I'm confused.

392
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,600
Is it Mr. Jeng?

393
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,250
You know about that?

394
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,640
You don't have to look so shocked,
it's not hard to tell.

395
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,200
These two brothers are the same.

396
00:35:22,742 --> 00:35:23,552
I don't know,

397
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,880
it's like he's playing with my feelings.

398
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,080
Do you understand?

399
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:31,580
Mr. Jeng.

400
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,060
He's too good to be true.

401
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,990
How could he like me?

402
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,200
Pat.

403
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,860
Don't sell yourself short.

404
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,790
If he really liked you.

405
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,080
He'd find a way to tell you.

406
00:35:55,633 --> 00:35:59,983
And if he's doing it to mess
with your head...

407
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,590
Mr. Jeng that's too good to be true.

408
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,630
He's no better than his brother.

409
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:13,530
Come on.

410
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,120
Let's make a toast to those brothers

411
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,400
that are giving us heartache!

412
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,230
Finish it all!

413
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:24,910
Don't challenge me!

414
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:28,940
That table too.

415
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:29,900
Kanoon, Ae.

416
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,430
The whole crew.

417
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:32,930
Bottoms up!

418
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:35,440
Let's drink to those two awful brothers!

419
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,800
What is he doing?!

420
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,110
I wish you luck.

421
00:36:59,400 --> 00:36:59,900
Yeah.

422
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,220
You too.

423
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,250
Don't you think it's funny?

424
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,620
It's so crazy.

425
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,800
Pat?

426
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:42,710
Chot? What are you doing here?

427
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,520
I have some documents for Mr. Jeng to sign.

428
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,630
He hasn't been in the office
for quite a few days.

429
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,160
It's good that you're here, talk to me.

430
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:59,740
What?

431
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,050
Don't tell anyone.

432
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,200
Mr. Jeng is resigning from the department.

433
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:13,790
Pat.

434
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,210
That's not true.

435
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,950
He built this department
with his own two hands,

436
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,120
why is he leaving so easily?

437
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:22,980
It's true.

438
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:29,400
I saw him talking
to a few talented people though.

439
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:34,180
So I asked directly what he was doing.

440
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:37,650
He said he was going to resign
and find someone to replace him.

441
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,970
Pat? What's wrong?

442
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,380
I'll be right back.

443
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:23,930
Happy birthday to you.

444
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:26,700
Happy birthday to you

445
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:30,600
happy birthday happy birthday.

446
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:36,320
Happy birthday to you.

447
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,530
Happy birthday Pat.

448
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:48,380
Here's the cake,
Mr. Jeng prepared it for you himself.

449
00:39:48,405 --> 00:39:50,835
- Yeah.
- I'm so jealous!

450
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,910
Thank you.

451
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:54,760
Happy birthday to you.

452
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:59,270
Happy birthday to you

453
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,400
happy birthday happy birthday.

454
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:08,890
Happy birthday to you.

455
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:11,690
Pat.

456
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:18,580
Happy birthday baby.

457
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:20,830
Thank you.

458
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:27,440
I wish you all the happiness in this world.

459
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:36,590
(Happy birthday Pat)

460
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:43,360
Pat.

461
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:48,080
What's wrong Pat?

462
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:54,380
Nothing, I'm just tired from work.

463
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,530
If there is anything, please tell us both.

464
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,620
Well, this year.

465
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,690
It was the year that I
forgot my own birthday.

466
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,670
I don't know why.

467
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:28,430
I even forgot that you'd come back
to see my every year.

468
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:36,640
It's like I focused on
everything except myself.

469
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:43,740
There's nothing wrong with that,
I've done that before.

470
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,260
You just have to live and learn.

471
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:50,410
Mom, dad.

472
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,660
But I don't know
how to deal with this feeling.

473
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,780
Everywhere I go.

474
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:04,140
It's filled with memories.

475
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:18,960
Pat.

476
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,360
I understand.

477
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,100
It's inevitable.

478
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,250
You can't escape anywhere.

479
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:31,600
Because the memory is with us.

480
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:46,440
Pat.

481
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,180
Everything will be fine now, baby.

482
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,830
Pat will be strong.

483
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,710
I've been through before.

484
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:05,230
It could have been better.

485
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,880
If you can stay with me all the time.

486
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:19,240
Pat.

487
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,060
Even if we weren't separated.

488
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:29,650
No one can stay with you all the time.

489
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:35,770
Life always has people coming in
and people going out.

490
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:38,970
But what will stay with us.

491
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:42,080
It's yourself.

492
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:52,590
Although.

493
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:58,330
It's true that your mother and I
are separated.

494
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:03,350
But we have never stopped loving you.

495
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,780
It's just a matter between us.

496
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:16,140
It can't go on together, that's all.

497
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:20,890
And we don't hate each other.

498
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,940
The two of us are here
as your father and mother.

499
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:33,890
But the matter of married life
is a part of real life.

500
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,620
We have to keep moving on.

501
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,350
Pat.

502
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,480
If it's not right.

503
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:54,560
No matter how much love we have for
each other, it's still not going to work.

504
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:01,950
I understand.

505
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:11,480
I'm sorry.

506
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:18,940
I'm sorry.

507
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:24,740
It's ok honey.

508
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:26,420
Please be strong.

509
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:32,520
It's ok honey. It's ok honey.

510
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:56,340
It's ok.

511
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:58,890
It's ok.

512
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:01,080
It's ok.

513
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:03,520
Be strong.

514
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:22,133
Could you had me the glass?

515
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:31,120
On the night I came back,
our son was so drunk.

516
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:32,900
A guy dropped him off.

517
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:36,720
I think it's that guy
that made our son be like that.

518
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:42,620
Pat is a grown up.

519
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:46,110
He can manage his life.

520
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,230
I know, but I can't help but worry.

521
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:52,970
Why don't you come back to
live in Thailand if you're so worried?

522
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,400
Hey, I already remarried.

523
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,850
I know, you don't have
to rub it in my face.

524
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:00,490
Oh...

525
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:05,550
What about that blonde babe of yours?

526
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:12,720
Things ended badly?

527
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:17,640
Have you told Pat?

528
00:48:18,923 --> 00:48:20,663
How can I tell him?

529
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:26,520
I understand,

530
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,670
you don't have to be strong all the time.

531
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:34,330
You can be weak in front of him,
he's an adult and he'll understand.

532
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:38,200
Or do you want to tell me?

533
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:39,720
I'm always ready to listen to you.

534
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:43,630
Because you'll always
be my greatest friend.

535
00:48:58,820 --> 00:48:59,290
Hey.

536
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,460
Hmm?

537
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:03,430
I need to ask you something.

538
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,240
What is it?

539
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:08,510
Do...

540
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:11,290
you have 2,000 baht?

541
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:13,730
Crazy man! Collect the dishes.

542
00:49:13,832 --> 00:49:15,982
I'm at my wit's end,
I wouldn't say it if I wasn't.

543
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,690
Pick them up, you wash them
and I'll help you collect them.

544
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:21,550
I thought you were always ready
to hear me out.

545
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:23,020
Crazy man.

546
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,720
Just a little? 2,000 baht?

547
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,440
No.

548
00:49:33,193 --> 00:49:35,813
It feels so good
to go shopping after you get paid.

549
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,280
We work for the billionaires
and then we use that money to buy their stuff.

550
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:42,990
That's right.

551
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:45,260
Next time, let's take a taxi.

552
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:48,400
I'm begging you.

553
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:50,800
Sure. Let Pat come out.

554
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,830
Just don't shop like this again.

555
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:53,710
Yeah.

556
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,990
But the cake that you bought.

557
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:56,530
Why?

558
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,300
Can I eat it?

559
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:58,840
Pat.

560
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,720
Think of my baby.

561
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,320
Are you ok? Are you hurt?

562
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:09,800
I'm fine, it's ok.

563
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:11,270
Are you ok?

564
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,210
I'm ok, I'm sorry.

565
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:50,480
I'm sorry but the car has broken down.

566
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:51,490
Oh.

567
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,410
- What should we do?
- What should we do?

568
00:51:00,153 --> 00:51:00,963
What if I don't have a car?

569
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:04,420
How can you carry all that?

570
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:07,470
My stomach hurts.

571
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:13,640
Do you think this pic is good?

572
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:15,870
It's good.

573
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:18,670
But the brand didn't send
a CI to you at all?

574
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:22,330
I have no idea, Knot took in this job.

575
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,440
I didn't pitch anything with him.

576
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:26,890
Wait, where is Knot?

577
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:29,280
Hey.

578
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,270
It's really late

579
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:33,870
and we've tried on a hundred fits,
isn't it enough?

580
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:36,270
There is a complaint.

581
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,030
Just one more fit.

582
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:41,980
Kathi, is there any outfit
that fits the brand's CI?

583
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:43,920
Knot said the brief was colorful,

584
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,490
you want the brand's CI
then take a look at the mood board.

585
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:51,760
Jen? Could I see the mood board?

586
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:54,560
Jen? He's resigned a month ago.

587
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,480
Are you still stuck on him?

588
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:58,710
Is there one?

589
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:11,820
Do you have it?

590
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,990
Just a sec, I'm looking.

591
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:20,540
I haven't seen a car at all.

592
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:22,360
What should we do?

593
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:25,270
Are you ok?

594
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:26,680
I think it's ok.

595
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:33,180
Hey Pat, I'm not ok.

596
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:35,080
- Why?
- I think I'm having the baby.

597
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:37,320
- Huh? What?
- Damn.

598
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:38,910
- What! Don't have it yet!
- Give birth now.

599
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:40,170
Make the baby stay put!

600
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,660
- How do I do that?
- I don't know.

601
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:44,910
Pat! I don't know
what water is coming out!

602
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,230
What is it?!!?

603
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:49,430
Wait, calm down.

604
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:52,860
- Pat, what should I do?
- I don't know if I'm going to let you go.

605
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:54,780
It's coming down!

606
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:02,300
Hello baby.

607
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,160
I'm having my baby!!

608
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:05,780
Having the baby?!

609
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,480
It's time?

610
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,870
I don't know,
my water is all over the street!

611
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:13,020
You can't deliver the baby here!

612
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:16,010
Where are you?
Send me the location right now!

613
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:18,460
What's going on?

614
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:20,160
Ae is having a baby!

615
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,800
- Huh?
- Yeah.

616
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:24,090
James.

617
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,130
Yes.

618
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:26,580
- Do you have a motorbike?
- Yes.

619
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:27,610
Let me borrow it right now.

620
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:34,140
Let's go!

621
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,170
Why are you going?
Look over the project.

622
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:37,380
I'm going to go help.

623
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,320
- Let's go!
- Go!

624
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:42,120
Hey.

625
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,440
- What should I do?
- Please exit the vehicle.

626
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,340
Get out of the car first.

627
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,300
She's going to have the baby.

628
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:48,510
Please have her sit.

629
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:51,140
What should I do?

630
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:52,360
Get off please. Get off please.

631
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,640
What the hell is this water?

632
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,170
Hey.

633
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:55,400
You have to sit down here.

634
00:53:55,850 --> 00:53:57,080
That's right. That's right.

635
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:00,220
That's correct. That's correct.

636
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:02,310
Ok.

637
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:04,810
- Take a deep breath. Take a deep breath.
- What are you giving birth to now?

638
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:11,380
Come on! Your wife is having a baby!

639
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,090
I'm more hurried than you! I know!

640
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:15,840
Hey, wait in front,
take a right on the next turn.

641
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:17,280
Where's the right?

642
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,620
Right ahead, you can't see it?

643
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,190
I didn't see it, that's why I asked.
Where's the right?

644
00:54:22,766 --> 00:54:23,806
Right in front!

645
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,570
Oh, wait for me, wait for me, oh.

646
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:28,970
How are you?

647
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:30,760
That hurts!

648
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:33,980
What should I do?

649
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:35,890
You have to push!

650
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,420
- Push!
- Push it out!

651
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,550
- Push it out!
- Excuse me,

652
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:40,990
what happened?

653
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,320
She is about to give birth,
I am a medical student.

654
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:45,910
Ouch.

655
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,690
Notify the center. Notify the center.
An auntie is about to give birth.

656
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:50,860
Request an ambulance, Nawamin Road urgently.

657
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:52,960
Can you stop calling me auntie, policeman?

658
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:56,410
When is this damn kid coming out!

659
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,530
Are you the father?

660
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,290
- Me?
- Yes.

661
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,360
No.

662
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,740
The size of the womb doesn't look very big.
As far as I can see,

663
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:06,190
the child is upside down.

664
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:08,010
How many weeks pregnant are you?

665
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:11,800
Oh, I don't remember, more than 30, oh.

666
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:13,920
You have to push. You have to push.

667
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:15,320
Oh, help me, help me, help me.

668
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:15,970
Push!

669
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:20,910
Your baby is out!

670
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:25,040
Why would you say that?
Well, I know, I'm in a hurry.

671
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:27,690
It's almost there,
it's almost there, wait a minute.

672
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,000
Is this right?

673
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:31,540
Go to where all the people are gathered.

674
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:32,520
Hey.

675
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,570
Quickly!

676
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:38,830
It hurts.

677
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:41,420
Ah, step up, it's okay.

678
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:43,950
Ok. Ok.

679
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,900
- It hurts.
- Take a deep breath and push.

680
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:48,750
Push.

681
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:50,800
Push.

682
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,140
I'm her husband.

683
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:56,030
Kanoon.

684
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,140
Kanoon!

685
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:00,940
Next time you're the one
who is getting pregnant!!

686
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,600
Pat, come out.

687
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,590
- Ok.
- There's so many people filming.

688
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:05,500
Go block them.

689
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:06,240
Yes come on.

690
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:08,080
I'm here honey!

691
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,420
Don't film! Don't film!

692
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:10,760
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

693
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:11,830
Damn it.

694
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:13,500
Is this your husband?

695
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,160
Uh, yes.

696
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,120
If so, I'm sorry to bother you.

697
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:19,850
Please get clean water,
warm water, new towels.

698
00:56:19,875 --> 00:56:22,395
And gloves,
and a sheet to lay out here too,

699
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:23,690
because I have to
deliver the baby here.

700
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:24,270
Wait,

701
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:25,850
- do we have to deliver it here?
- Yes,

702
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,070
I have deliver it here.

703
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:29,070
Ah, be patient.

704
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,680
The child's head popped.

705
00:56:30,737 --> 00:56:31,767
I'll go buy it now.

706
00:56:32,673 --> 00:56:33,993
I'm sorry, don't film it.

707
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:37,480
Ah, push.

708
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,450
Don't film.

709
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:42,000
I'm sorry,

710
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:57,590
Don't film it.

711
00:56:57,615 --> 00:56:59,635
Policeman, is an ambulance coming soon?

712
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:02,120
It's almost here. The hospital is far away.
Wait a little longer.

713
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,080
Don't take a picture!!
Don't take a picture!!

714
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,090
Don't take a picture!!
Don't take a picture!!

715
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:11,850
Can everyone stop filming?
Otherwise, I'll sue you all!

716
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:15,340
How are you?

717
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:18,750
Has it arrived yet?
The baby is about to be born.

718
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:20,780
It's almost here.

719
00:57:23,453 --> 00:57:25,733
How is Ae?

720
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:27,370
It's close.

721
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:29,150
Push!

722
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,020
It's not coming out!

723
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:33,940
Oh, push.

724
00:57:38,036 --> 00:57:38,776
Have a little patience.

725
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,510
- Push, push.
- Just push more.

726
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,830
One. Two. Three.

727
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:01,840
I found it!

728
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:11,960
The baby is here!

729
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:14,150
The baby is here!

730
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:17,360
Makham, are you safe?

731
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:20,890
Makham is safe. The baby is safe.

732
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,200
- Makham is safe.
- The baby is safe.

733
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,840
Jarb, the baby is here.

734
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:52,310
Congratulations.

735
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:55,890
I was very worried.

736
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:07,520
Come on.

737
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:09,080
Wait.

738
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:10,640
Take a picture for me.

739
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:12,300
- Take a picture for me.
- Sure.

740
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:14,610
Oh, ok.

741
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:16,540
Just a sec.

742
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:19,440
One. Two. Three.

743
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:21,840
Look at your baby's face.

744
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:22,540
Ok.

745
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:24,110
Ok.

746
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:25,630
That's good.

747
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:27,520
- The phone's memory is full.
- Is it good?

748
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,150
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

749
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:30,010
How is it?

750
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:30,720
- Hurry.
- Come on.

751
01:00:31,515 --> 01:00:33,025
We're leaving?

752
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:34,260
- Yeah.
- Oh, go, go.

753
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:36,910
See you.

754
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,520
- See you later.
- See you Kanoon. See you Ae.

755
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,040
Wow.

756
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:53,770
That was intense.

757
01:00:54,330 --> 01:00:56,090
Who would have thought

758
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,200
that she'd have here baby in the street?

759
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:01,760
I know she's adventurous
but not to this level.

760
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,360
They even came up
with the name really quickly.

761
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:09,230
Makham

762
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:11,370
is a cute name.

763
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:12,960
It's pretty cute.

764
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:13,920
Yeah.

765
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:27,290
She's a real fighter,

766
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:30,600
she even has time to upload the picture.

767
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,590
She even tagged us.

768
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:35,760
Ouch!

769
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:38,830
She blocked Makham's face.

770
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,210
Well, it's her baby.

771
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:45,060
But it's pretty cute.

772
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,360
That's true.

773
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:48,560
Kanoon is a dad.

774
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:50,630
Shocking, huh?

775
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:51,690
Yeah.

776
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:27,600
(sonic_baam: I'm excited.
I want to hold the baby.)

777
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:32,810
(littlejane: I'm glad to have met you.)

778
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:37,720
(putt. officlal: Congratulations, parents.)

779
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,180
(sonic_baam: I'm excited.
I want to hold baby.)

780
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:41,980
(littlejane: I'm glad to have met you.)

781
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:43,850
(putt. officlal: Congratulations, parents.)

782
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:22,750
(kittipong. attajiranon: Congratulations)

783
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:33,570
(Mr. Jeng: Absolutely Fine,
Take your time.)

784
01:04:35,983 --> 01:04:39,473
There's a big package for you,
I put it in your bedroom.

785
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:31,930
Do you want some?

786
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,030
It's good.

787
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:38,960
It's crispy and spicy,
it reminds me of wasabi from Japan.

788
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:42,280
I can't stop eating it.

789
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:14,150
(Happy birthday Pat)

790
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,950
(Mr. Jeng: Absolutely Fine,
Take your time.)

791
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:43,770
(Are you feeling better?)

792
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:29,730
(Mr. Jeng: It makes sense to me.)

793
01:08:22,203 --> 01:08:23,953
(Next Episode)
Mr. Jeng said he has something to announce.

794
01:08:24,410 --> 01:08:27,400
So there's morning meeting with the team tomorrow.

795
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:28,970
Super urgent.

796
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:32,100
Are you really leaving?

797
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:34,390
Do you still like me?

798
01:08:35,170 --> 01:08:36,470
I like you so much

799
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:38,460
and I like you more everyday.

800
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:42,640
