1
00:00:00,313 --> 00:00:01,921
I would like to introduce PutKris couple.

2
00:00:02,489 --> 00:00:04,257
Do you have any more actors?

3
00:00:04,257 --> 00:00:09,175
From these choices,
PutKris is likely to be the best among all.

4
00:00:11,184 --> 00:00:12,080
I'm worried about Pat,

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,797
afraid he can't handle it.

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,746
If we make it very visualized,

7
00:00:16,746 --> 00:00:18,497
and use the real actors taking a block shot.

8
00:00:18,497 --> 00:00:20,395
Forge may buy our idea.

9
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:23,717
You're like born and already at a finish line.

10
00:00:23,717 --> 00:00:26,667
Could you tell me
that it's gonna be worth?

11
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:29,146
Do you want the work out well?

12
00:00:48,096 --> 00:00:50,096
Sigh...

13
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:04,627
Kong: Pat, how are you?

14
00:02:04,627 --> 00:02:08,780
Kong: How are you doing?

15
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,293
Kong: We haven't seen each other in so long.

16
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,090
Ah, Mr. Jeng?

17
00:03:17,091 --> 00:03:21,052
As for our storyboard,
is Fjord ok with everything?

18
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:22,929
They are good with it.

19
00:03:23,478 --> 00:03:25,982
As for the tagline...

20
00:03:25,982 --> 00:03:30,279
Because the perfect taste takes time to find.

21
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:33,029
Be fresh, be lively, pick lively+.

22
00:03:33,029 --> 00:03:35,915
I want it to be clearer.

23
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:40,997
Of course Mr. Jeng,
I'll tell Jaab right away.

24
00:03:40,997 --> 00:03:42,549
Of course.

25
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,774
Don't make it too obvious.

26
00:03:44,775 --> 00:03:47,884
I'm afraid it'll look like
we're pushing it into their faces.

27
00:03:47,884 --> 00:03:51,397
But I think it's a good thing to do that.

28
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,398
I'm just kidding!

29
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,567
Ok.

30
00:03:55,567 --> 00:04:01,339
As for the fitting, it's confirmed to be
at Baan Jay Production House.

31
00:04:01,339 --> 00:04:02,723
Ok.

32
00:04:02,723 --> 00:04:06,292
Ok, then I won't take any more of your time.

33
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:07,508
Thank you so much.

34
00:04:07,508 --> 00:04:09,508
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Jen.

35
00:04:13,885 --> 00:04:19,349
I want there to be a promote
before the short film airs.

36
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:22,582
Chot and Pat, what do you think?
Will it work?

37
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,479
I think it would work,
like when a BL series airs,

38
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:28,922
normally, they will release content
to test the public's interest.

39
00:04:28,922 --> 00:04:31,594
I think it'd work for our project.

40
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:37,704
I think we should shoot content
for the fitting day and workshop day.

41
00:04:37,704 --> 00:04:41,945
Because makeup, lights, and camera are all ready.

42
00:04:41,945 --> 00:04:43,945
And we won't waste any time.

43
00:04:44,335 --> 00:04:49,360
Ok, so I'll have you look over
the promotes and still photos.

44
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,700
Of course, Mr. Jeng.

45
00:04:52,127 --> 00:04:54,127
Could I go off-topic?

46
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,343
Sure.

47
00:04:55,343 --> 00:04:57,343
Could I go and make Kanomjeen spicy salad?

48
00:04:57,344 --> 00:04:59,344
My customers are complaining.

49
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:00,389
Sure.

50
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:02,389
Thank you so much.
I'm going now.

51
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,970
Hot grilled chicken!

52
00:05:15,425 --> 00:05:16,922
Gobble! Gobble! Gobble!

53
00:05:16,922 --> 00:05:17,914
Hey, just a sec!

54
00:05:17,914 --> 00:05:18,681
Oh.

55
00:05:18,682 --> 00:05:19,618
Could I take a picture first?

56
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,955
What? Do it quickly!

57
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:25,133
Count too! One two three!

58
00:05:25,337 --> 00:05:26,945
I'm counting for the chicken, not you!

59
00:05:26,945 --> 00:05:28,945
Oh, ok.

60
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,655
Eat it.

61
00:05:32,655 --> 00:05:34,431
People are waiting! Come, come!

62
00:05:34,431 --> 00:05:36,151
Pat!!

63
00:05:36,151 --> 00:05:38,151
Come and help me squeeze the deep-fried rice

64
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:39,591
so I can finally start making Fermented Pork
and Crispy Rice Salad!

65
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:40,863
Just a sec.

66
00:05:40,864 --> 00:05:42,864
You're just on your phone!

67
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:46,979
Start!

68
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,664
Excuse me? Miss Cook?

69
00:05:49,664 --> 00:05:52,493
One Fermented Pork and
Crispy Rice Salad please, extra 15 baht.

70
00:05:52,493 --> 00:05:54,045
Coming up!

71
00:05:54,046 --> 00:05:54,926
Ok.

72
00:05:54,927 --> 00:05:56,927
Make it extra pretty.

73
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,541
The cook seems not too eager to do it.

74
00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:03,999
Why is the rice so hard?

75
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:08,109
Put more strength into it!!
If you're gonna to be weak,

76
00:06:08,109 --> 00:06:09,549
I'm not going to pay you in full!

77
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:11,549
You're not paying me anything anyway.

78
00:06:12,435 --> 00:06:16,060
Come and try the fermented papaya salad.

79
00:06:16,061 --> 00:06:18,397
What? Really?!

80
00:06:18,397 --> 00:06:20,397
This is the first batch!

81
00:06:20,398 --> 00:06:22,398
Is it good?

82
00:06:23,068 --> 00:06:24,789
You should open a restaurant.

83
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:26,789
Try it, Pat.

84
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:31,273
Smells so good.

85
00:06:31,273 --> 00:06:32,321
Hmm, it's good.

86
00:06:32,321 --> 00:06:34,321
Really?! Oh my!

87
00:06:34,322 --> 00:06:35,650
I'm talented like that.

88
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,023
Ok, Dad.

89
00:06:37,023 --> 00:06:41,253
It's here, it's another round of Mr. Jeng's shrimp donuts!

90
00:06:41,253 --> 00:06:42,693
Just a sec.

91
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:43,797
Ok.

92
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,694
Is it hot?

93
00:06:46,694 --> 00:06:47,798
It's not! Try it!

94
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:49,799
I'm going to gain so much weight
with this office.

95
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:51,519
So that means everything tastes good.

96
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,520
FYI! It's called nugget.

97
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,520
Totally ruining the moment.

98
00:06:58,454 --> 00:07:00,000
It's good.

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,721
Aren't you going to have some, Pat?

100
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,273
Some of Mr. Jeng's shrimp donuts.

101
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:06,226
I'm still not sure Dad.

102
00:07:10,837 --> 00:07:14,854
Oh! Pat! I told you not to do that,
it's in my eyes!

103
00:07:14,855 --> 00:07:16,575
It's stuck to the spoon.

104
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:20,242
Argh, just use the ladle to scrape it off.

105
00:07:20,242 --> 00:07:22,746
It's hard, I'm not doing it anymore.

106
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:23,626
Take it back.

107
00:07:23,626 --> 00:07:25,626
Ah? Being all dramatic at me?

108
00:07:25,627 --> 00:07:28,916
So dramatic, you just want to go eat.

109
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,300
Is there anything you need help with?

110
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:31,966
Ah! You're just in time.

111
00:07:31,966 --> 00:07:34,806
You can help with this,
Pat has dumped me.

112
00:07:34,806 --> 00:07:35,854
Of course.

113
00:07:35,854 --> 00:07:37,182
Thank you.

114
00:07:37,183 --> 00:07:38,567
Let me help decorate the plate.

115
00:07:38,568 --> 00:07:40,000
Ah!

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,937
So we can finally eat it!

117
00:07:40,937 --> 00:07:43,329
Do you want to try it?
It's the last piece.

118
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,329
Try it, try.

119
00:07:48,682 --> 00:07:50,682
Fine.

120
00:07:55,104 --> 00:07:56,376
How is it?

121
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,208
It's crispy.

122
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:00,881
Isn't it great? It's not even fried.

123
00:08:11,053 --> 00:08:13,053
Hey, Pat? What's that?

124
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:18,242
It has celery.

125
00:08:18,642 --> 00:08:20,642
I don't like it.

126
00:08:20,954 --> 00:08:22,954
Sure.

127
00:08:22,954 --> 00:08:24,954
What?

128
00:08:24,954 --> 00:08:25,891
You don't want any more?

129
00:08:25,891 --> 00:08:26,771
No, go ahead.

130
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:27,370
Oh.

131
00:08:28,656 --> 00:08:32,673
Sure, don't worry Dad.

132
00:08:33,402 --> 00:08:34,450
Looks good.

133
00:08:34,451 --> 00:08:35,723
Very much.

134
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:36,716
Looks delicious.

135
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,716
Just like the person who made them.

136
00:08:41,345 --> 00:08:44,241
Mr. Jeng, could I have the recipe to your shrimp donut?

137
00:08:44,499 --> 00:08:48,516
It's so good
that I want my dad to try and make it.

138
00:08:51,537 --> 00:08:52,417
Mr. Jeng?

139
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:54,893
Mr. Jeng.

140
00:08:54,893 --> 00:08:55,393
Yes!

141
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,660
I'll mail it to you.

142
00:09:00,884 --> 00:09:01,512
Ok.

143
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,318
Sorry for raising my voice.

144
00:09:05,318 --> 00:09:06,314
Oh, it's ok.

145
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:10,000
It's just a shrimp nugget.

146
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,548
Really?
So that's why everyone saw it as a nugget.

147
00:09:16,117 --> 00:09:21,829
Honestly, I'm asking for the recipe
because I want my dad to try and make it.

148
00:09:22,277 --> 00:09:24,020
So he might sell it.

149
00:09:24,608 --> 00:09:27,728
But if you're not ok with that,
then I won't do it.

150
00:09:27,728 --> 00:09:29,333
It's ok.

151
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:34,769
I don't skimp on my recipes.
If you want to sell it, do it, it's good.

152
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:35,709
Thank you.

153
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,760
(Kanomjeen spicy salad is here!)

154
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,395
Do you like it?

155
00:09:41,395 --> 00:09:43,332
Everybody loves it.

156
00:09:44,228 --> 00:09:44,834
Sure.

157
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:53,444
Um, but it seems like Pat doesn't like celery,
so he...

158
00:09:56,094 --> 00:09:56,974
Ok.

159
00:09:56,974 --> 00:09:57,918
It's ok.

160
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,844
Twirl~

161
00:10:02,844 --> 00:10:05,513
Get one and then get another one free!

162
00:10:05,513 --> 00:10:08,271
That way we want to see!

163
00:10:08,271 --> 00:10:09,993
Show me your talent.

164
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,404
What?

165
00:10:33,768 --> 00:10:35,040
What are you making?

166
00:10:35,796 --> 00:10:37,068
Try it for me.

167
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:46,606
Yeah, try it for me.

168
00:10:46,974 --> 00:10:48,918
Does it taste as good as it did?

169
00:10:49,258 --> 00:10:52,098
Or is it worse?

170
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,735
All of this?

171
00:10:55,735 --> 00:10:56,438
Yeah.

172
00:10:57,049 --> 00:10:58,321
Or just this much.

173
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:00,832
Here.

174
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,480
No.

175
00:11:05,426 --> 00:11:07,930
Come on Jaab, try it for me.

176
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:11,161
No.

177
00:11:13,267 --> 00:11:15,211
Calm down bro.

178
00:11:15,683 --> 00:11:17,515
Can I have it later?

179
00:11:17,515 --> 00:11:19,745
If you don't eat it now,
it won't be crispy.

180
00:11:20,001 --> 00:11:21,553
I can heat it up later.

181
00:11:21,553 --> 00:11:23,876
Heating it up will make it lose its flavor.

182
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:25,614
Here.

183
00:11:26,808 --> 00:11:28,528
No.

184
00:11:33,918 --> 00:11:36,254
Try it, quickly.

185
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,949
Hey, why are you raising your voice at me?

186
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:43,902
Just try it, I want to know.

187
00:12:02,654 --> 00:12:04,206
Do you really have to pressure me?

188
00:12:12,352 --> 00:12:13,119
How is it?

189
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,292
This is the best one.

190
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:21,680
I like this, it has a crunch to it.

191
00:12:22,768 --> 00:12:24,712
Does it smell of celery?

192
00:12:24,712 --> 00:12:26,707
Wait? It has celery in it?

193
00:12:26,707 --> 00:12:28,158
It does.

194
00:12:28,158 --> 00:12:30,961
But, you can't taste it right?

195
00:12:31,535 --> 00:12:32,415
Nope.

196
00:12:34,071 --> 00:12:38,424
So, why are you making it?
Did someone say it sucked?

197
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,007
No, I was just wondering.

198
00:12:41,754 --> 00:12:42,746
There's nothing going on.

199
00:12:47,382 --> 00:12:49,662
Why do you look so sad?

200
00:12:50,297 --> 00:12:53,586
You're just asking me now?

201
00:12:54,443 --> 00:12:57,283
Your brother is less important
than your shrimp nugget?

202
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:00,682
Are you ok?

203
00:13:00,682 --> 00:13:03,022
I'm fine.

204
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,183
I'm just not getting enough sleep.

205
00:13:05,183 --> 00:13:06,135
Are you sure?

206
00:13:06,135 --> 00:13:06,987
Yeah.

207
00:13:08,443 --> 00:13:09,659
Gotta go.

208
00:13:12,703 --> 00:13:14,199
So it's really good?

209
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:15,512
It is.

210
00:13:42,286 --> 00:13:43,838
(What do you like to eat?)

211
00:13:43,838 --> 00:13:45,106
(Japanese food.)

212
00:13:45,106 --> 00:13:47,446
(I told you, it's basic questions.)

213
00:13:48,604 --> 00:13:50,000
(What's your favorite color?)

214
00:13:50,401 --> 00:13:52,905
(I like 3 colors, white, black and red.)

215
00:13:52,905 --> 00:13:55,918
(I like to wear cream colored clothes.)

216
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,431
Wow, you look cheerful today.

217
00:14:01,356 --> 00:14:02,964
What?
Everything is normal.

218
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:04,802
What are you watching?

219
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,473
Come here, get a chair.

220
00:14:13,512 --> 00:14:14,896
Do you think we can do this?

221
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,559
Wouldn't it be repetitive?

222
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,540
Loads of people do it.

223
00:14:22,789 --> 00:14:25,965
But it sells!
It's up to our questions too.

224
00:14:26,376 --> 00:14:29,272
If we ask about fruits or vacation spots.

225
00:14:29,272 --> 00:14:31,183
So it'll relate to our products.

226
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,852
Ah huh.

227
00:14:33,095 --> 00:14:34,983
Should we do it with signs?

228
00:14:35,394 --> 00:14:37,394
Like in old game shows.

229
00:14:37,394 --> 00:14:41,113
Yeah, that sounds good and they can answer
at the same time, so they don't waste time writing it.

230
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:44,568
Yeah, and we'll use a fast beat to make it fun.

231
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,000
And the moments used for shipping
will just come naturally.

232
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,515
Perfect, I want that!

233
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:55,592
Should we write up the script?

234
00:14:55,592 --> 00:14:58,148
And don't worry about being repetitive.

235
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,461
Because if we make it perfectly, it'll be a classic!

236
00:15:00,461 --> 00:15:02,653
But if it's not perfect, it's be cliche.

237
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:03,804
Cliche!

238
00:15:04,692 --> 00:15:07,140
They are so cute!

239
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,276
I think it's good.

240
00:15:08,965 --> 00:15:10,965
They look like me when I was younger!

241
00:15:11,358 --> 00:15:13,078
Like twins!

242
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:13,944
Really?

243
00:15:13,944 --> 00:15:15,020
Yes!

244
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,849
Fine.

245
00:15:37,751 --> 00:15:38,631
Hey.

246
00:15:38,631 --> 00:15:39,131
Huh?

247
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,992
Does this work?

248
00:15:42,915 --> 00:15:44,523
Yes!

249
00:15:44,822 --> 00:15:48,055
Could you make the signs?
I'll send you the file.

250
00:15:48,055 --> 00:15:48,918
Sure.

251
00:15:48,918 --> 00:15:50,001
Perfect!

252
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:51,474
Ok.

253
00:16:03,852 --> 00:16:05,068
Where are you going?

254
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:08,794
I've done my hair, so I'm going out!

255
00:16:21,492 --> 00:16:23,156
Can I borrow your hair straightener?

256
00:16:23,623 --> 00:16:24,615
Why?

257
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:27,978
Do you have a date with a guy?

258
00:16:27,978 --> 00:16:29,751
Why? Do you have a date with a guy?

259
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:31,590
You're keeping secrets from me!

260
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:35,894
No, I'm not seeing a guy, I'm just seeing my friend.

261
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:38,983
Your lies are spewing all over the floor!

262
00:16:38,983 --> 00:16:41,746
If you're seeing a friend
then don't bother with your hair.

263
00:16:42,182 --> 00:16:43,734
You can just go with this hair.

264
00:16:43,734 --> 00:16:44,369
Ah!

265
00:16:46,915 --> 00:16:47,570
Put away your stuff!

266
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,660
Ok, fine.

267
00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:51,385
The senior that I knew at America.

268
00:16:52,464 --> 00:16:54,464
He invited me out to dinner.

269
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:58,425
Great, where?
Tell me all about it!

270
00:16:59,161 --> 00:17:00,937
You really like to know other people's business.

271
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:01,437
Come on!

272
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:03,903
He invited me to eat at Chef's Table.

273
00:17:04,403 --> 00:17:05,967
So I want to look a little better.

274
00:17:05,967 --> 00:17:10,269
Ooh, you're gorgeous,
Pat! Men swarming around you!

275
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:11,208
You wanna see his pic?

276
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,118
Yes, yes!

277
00:17:16,007 --> 00:17:20,000
Wow, I'm dead!
Come, come, I'll do your hair.

278
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:30,361
It's hot!

279
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:37,891
Sis?

280
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:38,518
Huh?

281
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:40,805
How do you know how to do hair?

282
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,878
It's the 101 basics of being a ladyboy.

283
00:17:46,825 --> 00:17:50,282
You were just sitting in the office,
why is your head so fluffy?

284
00:17:50,282 --> 00:17:51,991
The work is a lot.

285
00:17:52,724 --> 00:17:54,724
All done!

286
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:59,029
On point with Chot Salon!

287
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:00,451
Thank you.

288
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:01,231
Sure.

289
00:18:08,352 --> 00:18:11,472
I'm rooting for you, bye!

290
00:18:16,989 --> 00:18:17,756
See you.

291
00:18:17,756 --> 00:18:18,907
See ya!

292
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:51,931
(Kong: Something came up,
I can't go to dinner with you tonight.)

293
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:30,000
Pat?

294
00:19:35,345 --> 00:19:36,561
Why are you still here?

295
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:38,193
Why are you going home so late?

296
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:41,393
Is there a lot of work?

297
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:43,241
No.

298
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:46,044
At first I was going to meet up with someone.

299
00:19:48,584 --> 00:19:50,304
But he just cancelled on me.

300
00:19:50,304 --> 00:19:51,818
But I'm going home soon.

301
00:19:54,447 --> 00:19:56,223
Have you eaten yet?

302
00:19:56,773 --> 00:19:58,885
Um, are you hungry?

303
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,118
There's a buy 1 get 1 free promotion.

304
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:07,529
Um, I can't finish it all myself.

305
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,000
Do you want to eat it with me?

306
00:20:25,927 --> 00:20:27,311
Don't worry.

307
00:20:28,766 --> 00:20:31,214
I just want there to be food waste.

308
00:21:00,942 --> 00:21:02,942
Did you just get off work?

309
00:21:03,477 --> 00:21:04,413
Yes.

310
00:21:08,293 --> 00:21:11,301
You don't have to act all official with me.

311
00:21:11,712 --> 00:21:13,712
It's after work hours.

312
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:16,365
It's a force of habit.

313
00:21:17,056 --> 00:21:18,216
I understand.

314
00:21:19,635 --> 00:21:24,044
But if you need any help from me after work hours,
you can tell me.

315
00:21:24,511 --> 00:21:28,304
Or you can tell me
if there's something bothering you.

316
00:21:39,303 --> 00:21:41,135
You don't like eating shrimp donuts?

317
00:21:47,062 --> 00:21:47,998
Water?

318
00:21:48,827 --> 00:21:49,538
Yes.

319
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:58,362
The other day,
I saw you eat the shrimp donut and spit it out.

320
00:21:58,362 --> 00:22:02,594
It's not that I don't like it.

321
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,882
But it had celery in it.

322
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,799
I don't like eating celery.

323
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,063
It's not that I didn't like your shrimp donut.

324
00:22:13,383 --> 00:22:14,487
I'm sorry.

325
00:22:16,651 --> 00:22:19,211
But I put only a little bit of celery.

326
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:24,760
So it means you knew it had celery,
because you have great taste buds.

327
00:22:27,225 --> 00:22:28,105
Right?

328
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:32,782
Are you angry at me?

329
00:22:33,808 --> 00:22:34,912
I'm not.

330
00:22:35,995 --> 00:22:37,267
It's not a big deal.

331
00:22:38,462 --> 00:22:42,143
Next time I'll give it another go.

332
00:22:46,641 --> 00:22:47,633
Oh.

333
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,556
I'm not going to tomorrow's fitting.

334
00:22:51,556 --> 00:22:55,167
So could you and Chot
please overlook the work tomorrow?

335
00:22:55,621 --> 00:22:56,669
Sure.

336
00:23:02,907 --> 00:23:03,562
You can have it.

337
00:23:03,562 --> 00:23:05,440
I'll take this one.

338
00:23:08,961 --> 00:23:11,297
The topping came off.

339
00:23:11,297 --> 00:23:12,834
You can take this one.

340
00:23:21,301 --> 00:23:22,068
Eat up.

341
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:22,885
Ok.

342
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,124
Smile! Smile some more!

343
00:23:52,124 --> 00:23:56,109
Like, oh the sun is in my eyes.

344
00:23:57,899 --> 00:24:00,291
Just like that, very good!

345
00:24:00,646 --> 00:24:04,495
Perfect, 10 out of 10!

346
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:08,620
Jub?

347
00:24:08,975 --> 00:24:11,703
Could you touch up Kris's makeup?

348
00:24:11,703 --> 00:24:14,626
I want it to be more glowy,
it's a bit gray.

349
00:24:14,626 --> 00:24:15,484
Of course.

350
00:24:15,484 --> 00:24:16,496
Thanks.

351
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,748
Yes, something like that, thanks.

352
00:24:29,748 --> 00:24:30,996
Kanoon, take a picture.

353
00:24:30,996 --> 00:24:32,146
You got it.

354
00:24:37,407 --> 00:24:38,623
How is it Pat?

355
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,986
It's going great.

356
00:24:43,197 --> 00:24:45,085
Wow, it looks good.

357
00:24:46,204 --> 00:24:48,316
Put, if you're all done
then you can go get some rest.

358
00:24:48,316 --> 00:24:51,320
Because we'll be taking still shots of Kris next.

359
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,528
Ok. Alright.

360
00:24:54,424 --> 00:24:55,556
Thank you.

361
00:25:01,903 --> 00:25:03,903
Do you want to see the pictures?

362
00:25:04,277 --> 00:25:05,773
Up to you.

363
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:10,986
Do you want anything to drink?
I'll order it for you.

364
00:25:12,853 --> 00:25:16,926
Try asking Pat,
he knows what I like to drink.

365
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:28,537
Americano?

366
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:30,000
Yes.

367
00:25:30,808 --> 00:25:33,984
Please order 2 iced Americanos.

368
00:25:33,984 --> 00:25:35,937
The other one is for Pat.

369
00:25:36,638 --> 00:25:38,078
Ah, ok.

370
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,345
So, I'll order 2 Americanos.

371
00:25:40,345 --> 00:25:40,845
Ok.

372
00:25:40,845 --> 00:25:41,795
Then I'll bring it to you.

373
00:25:41,795 --> 00:25:42,808
Sure.

374
00:25:46,847 --> 00:25:48,567
Please excuse me.

375
00:25:49,015 --> 00:25:49,961
Sure.

376
00:25:55,775 --> 00:25:58,279
Please excuse me, I'll be right back.

377
00:25:58,279 --> 00:25:59,244
Ah, sure.

378
00:26:31,819 --> 00:26:35,500
Acting like you don't remember what I like to eat.

379
00:26:35,855 --> 00:26:36,791
Put.

380
00:26:37,426 --> 00:26:38,642
What are you playing at?

381
00:26:39,445 --> 00:26:40,885
This is my job!

382
00:26:40,885 --> 00:26:43,381
What will other people think of me
if you do this?

383
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:46,049
But you shouldn't ignore me like that.

384
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:50,535
Look, you're always making that face
when you see me.

385
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:55,923
Well? If you're not in trouble.

386
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,998
You won't be nice to me?

387
00:27:03,396 --> 00:27:05,284
Asking for you help

388
00:27:05,646 --> 00:27:08,654
doesn't mean you can do this to me.

389
00:27:12,091 --> 00:27:12,802
Pat.

390
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:17,118
Put? Put? Where are you?

391
00:27:17,118 --> 00:27:20,138
Oh, you're here.

392
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:24,156
There will be an interview and some contents.

393
00:27:24,156 --> 00:27:25,258
Sure.

394
00:27:25,258 --> 00:27:27,332
In this outfit?

395
00:27:27,332 --> 00:27:29,826
Ah, let's change it
and make you more handsome than this.

396
00:27:29,826 --> 00:27:33,076
It's all prepared inside, you can go now.

397
00:27:33,076 --> 00:27:33,795
Sure.

398
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:42,606
Pat.

399
00:27:43,408 --> 00:27:44,904
Why are you making that face?

400
00:27:44,904 --> 00:27:46,659
Is there something wrong? You can tell me.

401
00:27:48,732 --> 00:27:50,564
Chot! Where are you?

402
00:27:50,564 --> 00:27:51,943
What??

403
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:55,287
Me again? I stepped outside for only 2 seconds!

404
00:28:38,124 --> 00:28:39,732
Hmm.

405
00:28:40,367 --> 00:28:43,151
Pat, whatever you eat looks delicious.

406
00:28:46,195 --> 00:28:48,363
Oh, I'm so sorry.

407
00:28:48,363 --> 00:28:52,191
I couldn't book the restaurant
that we were going to go to.

408
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:53,581
It's all booked up.

409
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,822
It's ok.

410
00:28:58,513 --> 00:29:00,233
This place is also good.

411
00:29:00,233 --> 00:29:01,177
I like it.

412
00:29:01,762 --> 00:29:02,473
Really?

413
00:29:05,248 --> 00:29:08,873
So, can I ask you?
Where are you working now?

414
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:09,780
Of course.

415
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,708
I'm doing Digital Marketing at Jian Group.

416
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:15,160
Wow, that's a big company.

417
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,267
How is it?

418
00:29:17,267 --> 00:29:20,563
It's ok, but we're quite busy now.

419
00:29:20,963 --> 00:29:24,812
I've got a project in my responsibility.

420
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:27,741
Hmm, you're talented.

421
00:29:27,741 --> 00:29:31,577
So how's your work?
Can I ask you?

422
00:29:33,874 --> 00:29:35,749
Well, I also work in marketing.

423
00:29:35,749 --> 00:29:40,001
It's great, it's challenging, fun and the pay is great.

424
00:29:41,002 --> 00:29:44,851
Last week my company just took us
to an outing at Bali, so fun.

425
00:29:45,094 --> 00:29:47,710
Oh, the trip I saw on your story?

426
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,372
Yeah.

427
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,000
So luxurious.

428
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,099
Right?

429
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:54,735
Hey Pat, if you really want to do it,
you can do it.

430
00:29:54,735 --> 00:29:58,207
I think you have potential, believe me.

431
00:30:00,001 --> 00:30:02,505
If you want to do this I can teach you.

432
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:07,260
Well, I have just adjusted to my work place.

433
00:30:07,656 --> 00:30:10,720
And it's going really well.

434
00:30:10,963 --> 00:30:12,067
Really?

435
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:16,446
I think it's the work that you do
looks very tiring.

436
00:30:16,895 --> 00:30:18,727
I see you getting off work late all the time.

437
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,970
I think it's not worth the energy that you lose.

438
00:30:21,295 --> 00:30:22,623
Like my work,

439
00:30:22,623 --> 00:30:25,433
we get as much as we put in.

440
00:30:25,433 --> 00:30:27,203
The more we do it, the more we get.

441
00:30:27,203 --> 00:30:29,890
And about time,
we can manage it all by ourselves.

442
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,197
It's very good.

443
00:30:31,197 --> 00:30:34,361
Well, I would say
that it's not like any other marketing.

444
00:30:34,361 --> 00:30:35,892
The work that I'm doing.

445
00:30:39,573 --> 00:30:40,677
Kong?

446
00:30:40,677 --> 00:30:44,271
What company do you work for?

447
00:30:45,475 --> 00:30:47,867
Here, let me show you.

448
00:30:49,062 --> 00:30:50,894
Here, I'll show you my company first.

449
00:30:51,137 --> 00:30:52,129
Do you see the product?

450
00:30:52,129 --> 00:30:55,005
It's very beautiful and it's very easy to sell.

451
00:30:55,005 --> 00:30:58,810
Which is very good,
we have promotions to give away all the time.

452
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:02,266
My products aren't no name products.

453
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:03,879
It's very famous abroad,

454
00:31:03,879 --> 00:31:06,725
the raw material that we use is like this.

455
00:31:06,725 --> 00:31:09,392
All 4 extracts and so many things.

456
00:31:09,392 --> 00:31:11,960
I don't have to talk about my product, it's very good.

457
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,875
Like it's already sold by itself.

458
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:15,668
You don't have to do much.

459
00:31:15,668 --> 00:31:16,825
And like the first month, if you get..

460
00:31:16,825 --> 00:31:19,630
Kong, I have some urgent work.

461
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,567
I have to go back to the office now.

462
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,714
Right now?

463
00:31:24,714 --> 00:31:25,289
Yes.

464
00:31:26,378 --> 00:31:27,370
I'm so sorry.

465
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:31,504
Do you see this?
They don't respect your personal time at all.

466
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:33,542
I don't think it's ok at all.

467
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:36,394
Oh, are you going right away?

468
00:31:37,449 --> 00:31:38,497
Hey Pat.

469
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:39,305
Pat.

470
00:31:49,655 --> 00:31:50,759
Pat.

471
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,761
Yes boss, I'm on my way.

472
00:31:58,761 --> 00:32:01,170
(Huh? Pat? This is Put.)

473
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,217
Boss?

474
00:32:06,864 --> 00:32:10,400
(Fine, how much time will it take you?)

475
00:32:11,147 --> 00:32:13,880
No more than 20 minutes.

476
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,258
(Too slow, you have to get to the office in 15 minutes.)

477
00:32:17,594 --> 00:32:19,258
15 minutes?

478
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:21,944
Ok.

479
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,491
But Pat.

480
00:32:23,851 --> 00:32:24,450
Pat?

481
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:36,791
Thank you.

482
00:32:37,364 --> 00:32:40,260
(It's ok, you can trust me on my acting skills.)

483
00:32:40,727 --> 00:32:42,167
(But what just happened?)

484
00:32:43,693 --> 00:32:47,598
Someone was trying to get me
to join their MLM business.

485
00:32:48,345 --> 00:32:49,617
So I...

486
00:32:49,617 --> 00:32:52,018
(Oh, ok. I understand now.)

487
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:54,815
I'm going to hang up now.

488
00:32:54,815 --> 00:32:56,573
(Hey, wait.)

489
00:32:57,459 --> 00:32:59,179
(You're just going to hang up on me?)

490
00:32:59,702 --> 00:33:01,702
(I thought you were coming to see me.)

491
00:33:02,154 --> 00:33:03,480
(In like 15 minutes?)

492
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,725
15 minutes? I was just saying stuff.

493
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,618
Don't force me.

494
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:10,289
(Well?)

495
00:33:10,928 --> 00:33:14,536
(Then can you change
a normal thank you to dinner instead?)

496
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,344
(Well? )

497
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:24,533
Fine.

498
00:33:24,533 --> 00:33:25,792
We'll talk later.

499
00:33:38,581 --> 00:33:42,262
As for me, I'm very happy
to be working with Kris again.

500
00:33:42,262 --> 00:33:43,589
He's is still as cute as ever.

501
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:47,675
Me too, I'm so happy to see Put again.

502
00:33:47,675 --> 00:33:49,447
He's still adorable as always.

503
00:33:50,385 --> 00:33:53,113
Please stay tuned for our new advertisement
that's coming out soon.

504
00:33:53,113 --> 00:33:55,193
And please stay tuned with Lively+.

505
00:33:55,193 --> 00:33:58,854
Be fresh, be lively, pick lively+.

506
00:33:58,854 --> 00:34:01,670
High vitamin-c candy that's tasty.

507
00:34:03,677 --> 00:34:05,677
Mr. Jeng, is there anything wrong with it?

508
00:34:07,203 --> 00:34:08,811
Are you both ok with it?

509
00:34:10,001 --> 00:34:14,466
I'm fine with it.

510
00:34:16,584 --> 00:34:17,632
What about Pat?

511
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:19,763
I'm ok with it.

512
00:34:21,014 --> 00:34:22,286
I'm also fine with it.

513
00:34:22,585 --> 00:34:23,969
I think it's very good.

514
00:34:27,202 --> 00:34:33,000
Then if everyone is ok with it,
I'm going to go check on another project.

515
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,742
Go ahead.

516
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,742
Are you really ok with it?

517
00:34:45,381 --> 00:34:46,709
I'm fine with it.

518
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:50,961
As for Twitter trends,
I think you and Chot will know more than me.

519
00:34:51,845 --> 00:34:54,520
Thank you, I'll go prep some work.

520
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,593
Ok.

521
00:35:01,023 --> 00:35:02,183
I'm sorry.

522
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:06,408
My back hurts, the chair at my house
isn't that great anymore.

523
00:35:06,744 --> 00:35:09,052
I'm thinking of buying a new one.

524
00:35:10,001 --> 00:35:11,609
Oh, when are you going?

525
00:35:15,885 --> 00:35:19,061
Uh, on Saturday.

526
00:35:21,097 --> 00:35:22,313
Hmm.

527
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,720
Do you want to go with me?

528
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:32,617
I also need to buy some furniture for my restaurant.

529
00:35:41,492 --> 00:35:42,259
Please.

530
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,425
Excuse me Mr. Jeng.

531
00:35:45,425 --> 00:35:47,872
Pat? Someone is here to see you.

532
00:35:48,952 --> 00:35:49,719
Ok.

533
00:35:54,143 --> 00:35:55,960
Please excuse me.

534
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,321
Ok.

535
00:36:01,921 --> 00:36:03,641
Hi pretty lady.

536
00:36:03,641 --> 00:36:06,201
Gosh, you're working so hard!
Are you tired or do you have a headache?

537
00:36:06,201 --> 00:36:10,260
Here, today I have a product to present.
This one is very famous.

538
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,843
If it's not me selling it, other people sell it very expensively.

539
00:36:13,843 --> 00:36:17,081
This is like 10,000 a bottle.

540
00:36:17,081 --> 00:36:18,969
But if you buy with me today
I'll give you 3.

541
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:19,731
Kong?

542
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:20,470
Huh?

543
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,612
What are you doing here?

544
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:24,705
Hello Pat, how are you?

545
00:36:24,705 --> 00:36:25,875
This is my work place.

546
00:36:27,299 --> 00:36:29,720
Well, it's time for your break, isn't it?

547
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,560
I've come to see you,
but you didn't answer my text so I came up.

548
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,120
But you have to wait for me to answer first.

549
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,512
Well, I'm sorry.

550
00:36:38,512 --> 00:36:41,002
Well, I need to hurry and go somewhere else.

551
00:36:41,002 --> 00:36:43,495
Hey, today I've brought some test products
for you to try.

552
00:36:43,495 --> 00:36:46,881
This Krill Oil is very famous.

553
00:36:46,881 --> 00:36:50,241
Contains 6,000 times more antioxidants than vitamins.

554
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:54,202
You must try it out. It  helps nourish the brain
and makes your memory better too.

555
00:36:54,202 --> 00:36:55,715
It's ok.

556
00:36:56,161 --> 00:36:57,320
I don't want to take it.

557
00:36:57,771 --> 00:37:01,320
Hey, don't be taken back!
We have known each other for a long time.

558
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:05,544
You can try and eat it,
I want you to try and open up to new things.

559
00:37:07,527 --> 00:37:08,120
Ah.

560
00:37:11,421 --> 00:37:12,133
Ah...

561
00:37:12,133 --> 00:37:13,795
Is Ying here?

562
00:37:20,819 --> 00:37:22,371
Ying...

563
00:37:32,961 --> 00:37:34,401
Ying...

564
00:37:38,955 --> 00:37:40,000
She's not here.

565
00:37:40,646 --> 00:37:43,430
Um, she's not?

566
00:37:46,178 --> 00:37:46,920
Then Pat..

567
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,909
Here I give you the whole set.
This is the complete set, don't worry.

568
00:37:50,909 --> 00:37:53,401
Take it in the morning, afternoon and evening.

569
00:37:53,401 --> 00:37:55,361
This set is very expensive.

570
00:37:55,361 --> 00:37:57,005
But I'm giving it to you, don't worry.

571
00:37:57,005 --> 00:37:59,444
Pat! There you are!

572
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:04,318
Come and look over the script with me.

573
00:38:04,318 --> 00:38:05,422
Right away.

574
00:38:05,422 --> 00:38:09,318
I really need him right now,
there's so much work to do.

575
00:38:10,001 --> 00:38:10,840
Ok.

576
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,251
I'm going to go now.

577
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:13,403
Ah, for you to eat.

578
00:38:13,403 --> 00:38:14,297
See you.

579
00:38:17,433 --> 00:38:18,425
What was that?

580
00:38:19,542 --> 00:38:20,926
Gosh.

581
00:38:20,926 --> 00:38:21,840
Do you want it?

582
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,598
Take it.

583
00:38:22,598 --> 00:38:23,499
Krill oil...

584
00:38:23,499 --> 00:38:24,586
Eww.

585
00:38:26,601 --> 00:38:27,593
Auntie.

586
00:38:28,601 --> 00:38:29,481
Pat!

587
00:38:30,001 --> 00:38:31,360
My hero!

588
00:38:31,723 --> 00:38:33,107
Thank you!

589
00:38:33,798 --> 00:38:36,200
I don't want to join his MLM team, you know?

590
00:38:37,161 --> 00:38:37,928
Thank you.

591
00:38:41,492 --> 00:38:42,988
How did he get up here?

592
00:39:06,481 --> 00:39:08,089
Mom!

593
00:39:08,641 --> 00:39:10,000
Jaab!

594
00:39:11,277 --> 00:39:13,949
You scared me!
Come sit here.

595
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,816
Mom, I missed you so much.

596
00:39:20,551 --> 00:39:24,120
You don't really come home.

597
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,569
Always working.

598
00:39:25,569 --> 00:39:28,137
Let me see your face.

599
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:33,200
Gosh, look at your pores!

600
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:33,700
Really?

601
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,875
Let me mask your face.

602
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,011
There it is, ah.

603
00:39:51,453 --> 00:39:53,453
It's cold.

604
00:39:53,453 --> 00:39:54,601
Is it nice?

605
00:39:58,191 --> 00:40:00,191
Look after yourself.

606
00:40:01,033 --> 00:40:02,529
What is this?

607
00:40:02,529 --> 00:40:05,324
You came back to sleep at home,
did you run out of money?

608
00:40:05,324 --> 00:40:09,964
No, I just miss you.

609
00:40:09,964 --> 00:40:12,442
Hm?

610
00:40:12,442 --> 00:40:13,642
Take that!

611
00:40:15,771 --> 00:40:17,281
Fine.

612
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,080
You know me so well.

613
00:40:25,326 --> 00:40:27,326
Calm down.

614
00:40:31,641 --> 00:40:33,520
Have you ever had your heart broken?

615
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:35,520
Huh?

616
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:39,135
I'm going to use it for work.

617
00:40:40,441 --> 00:40:42,217
I want to know if...

618
00:40:44,028 --> 00:40:45,524
People your age...

619
00:40:47,055 --> 00:40:49,055
When they get their heart broken.

620
00:40:50,263 --> 00:40:52,095
How do they deal with it?

621
00:40:52,095 --> 00:40:54,196
Huh? Jaab.

622
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:56,853
You're asking the wrong person.

623
00:40:57,353 --> 00:41:00,000
Someone like me has never been heart broken.

624
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:04,040
Because I'm beautiful.

625
00:41:09,201 --> 00:41:11,201
Before I met your dad.

626
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:13,174
I had a boyfriend.

627
00:41:13,174 --> 00:41:14,726
His name was Somyot.

628
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,640
But I chose your dad.

629
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,841
Because your dad was way hotter.

630
00:41:22,726 --> 00:41:24,200
You were two timing?

631
00:41:24,577 --> 00:41:25,849
No!

632
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:29,100
I broke up with Somyot
before I got with your dad.

633
00:41:33,118 --> 00:41:35,118
But you fell for someone else.

634
00:41:36,479 --> 00:41:40,000
Someone else? It's your dad.

635
00:41:41,425 --> 00:41:43,649
That's how it is, a couple's life.

636
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:51,232
As for me, I wasn't someone who was going to love
only 1 person until I die.

637
00:41:51,232 --> 00:41:54,360
I had to try out the rights and wrongs.

638
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:59,135
But I think I don't have much experience.

639
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:02,001
Maybe you should try asking someone else.

640
00:42:02,001 --> 00:42:08,587
Maybe they will have the answer you're looking for.

641
00:42:09,296 --> 00:42:11,296
What answer?

642
00:42:11,813 --> 00:42:13,813
I'm just going to write something up for work.

643
00:42:13,813 --> 00:42:17,022
Well, I was talking about work.

644
00:43:02,186 --> 00:43:03,738
Ah, that's it.

645
00:43:15,136 --> 00:43:17,136
(Jeng: I'm in front of your house.)

646
00:43:48,989 --> 00:43:50,000
Hi Mr. Jeng!

647
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,560
Hello.

648
00:43:57,282 --> 00:43:59,338
Did you wait for long?

649
00:43:59,338 --> 00:44:00,365
No.

650
00:44:02,343 --> 00:44:03,727
Fasten your seat belt.

651
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:04,641
Ok.

652
00:44:15,225 --> 00:44:16,105
Are you ready?

653
00:44:16,105 --> 00:44:16,605
Yes.

654
00:44:18,441 --> 00:44:19,657
Let's go.

655
00:44:40,001 --> 00:44:41,217
This is so cool.

656
00:44:42,565 --> 00:44:44,117
I'll buy it right away.

657
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:48,089
Mr. Jeng.

658
00:44:48,892 --> 00:44:52,360
What kind of spoon do you want for your restaurant?

659
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:56,328
Um, I want something different.

660
00:44:56,328 --> 00:44:57,841
Not too modern,

661
00:44:57,841 --> 00:45:01,361
but it has to go with the restaurant's concept.

662
00:45:01,361 --> 00:45:02,918
Um.

663
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:06,280
The floral kind that parents like to buy?

664
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,776
Something like that.

665
00:45:09,441 --> 00:45:10,657
Something like that.

666
00:45:11,628 --> 00:45:14,917
I think our office has those kinds of spoons.

667
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,039
Oh.

668
00:45:18,344 --> 00:45:19,480
That's right.

669
00:45:19,747 --> 00:45:23,720
Maybe we should just steal it from our office.

670
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,318
Wait, Mr. Jeng.

671
00:45:26,121 --> 00:45:27,281
Calm down.

672
00:45:27,281 --> 00:45:30,001
You can't be stealing spoons from your own office!

673
00:45:30,001 --> 00:45:31,001
I can't?

674
00:45:31,001 --> 00:45:32,062
You can't.

675
00:45:32,486 --> 00:45:32,986
Ok.

676
00:45:32,986 --> 00:45:38,417
I actually saw while we were walking here,
I think they have the spoons you want over there.

677
00:45:39,033 --> 00:45:40,000
Do you want to go check it out?

678
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:40,502
Sure.

679
00:45:42,502 --> 00:45:43,494
Let's go.

680
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,744
Here it is.

681
00:45:50,813 --> 00:45:53,149
The old flowery spoon you want.

682
00:45:58,298 --> 00:46:03,720
It's pretty, but when you say that,
then I'm too scared to buy it.

683
00:46:14,921 --> 00:46:16,473
What are you making?

684
00:46:17,836 --> 00:46:18,491
Ah.

685
00:46:19,275 --> 00:46:20,000
Oh.

686
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:23,462
I'm making garlic veggies with carrot.

687
00:46:25,106 --> 00:46:26,826
Let me add a bit of that.

688
00:46:35,538 --> 00:46:36,978
Careful, it's hot.

689
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,920
Aren't you hot?

690
00:46:51,645 --> 00:46:53,645
You're really slow Mr. Jeng.

691
00:46:53,645 --> 00:46:55,064
I feel things slowly.

692
00:47:03,641 --> 00:47:05,560
Oh! That's cute!

693
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,931
This person is cute.

694
00:47:06,931 --> 00:47:08,512
This person is also cute!

695
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,872
That's not a person.

696
00:47:13,571 --> 00:47:15,720
This one is cute.

697
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,736
This is also cute.

698
00:47:16,736 --> 00:47:17,761
This one is cute too!

699
00:47:25,001 --> 00:47:28,682
Here is the zone I looked for.

700
00:47:32,678 --> 00:47:34,174
This one is interesting.

701
00:47:34,921 --> 00:47:36,305
But is it too old?

702
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:39,724
Do you want to try it?

703
00:47:41,161 --> 00:47:41,760
Yes.

704
00:47:42,627 --> 00:47:44,291
I think it's soft.

705
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:46,141
Yes.

706
00:47:56,841 --> 00:47:57,777
The lever?

707
00:47:58,132 --> 00:47:59,120
Where is it?

708
00:47:59,587 --> 00:48:02,483
I think it's in the front.

709
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:04,895
I'm sorry.

710
00:48:06,706 --> 00:48:07,978
Let me adjust it for you.

711
00:48:24,853 --> 00:48:26,629
Thank you.

712
00:48:28,247 --> 00:48:29,680
Do you like it?

713
00:48:32,812 --> 00:48:34,252
Uh.

714
00:48:39,179 --> 00:48:41,179
Do you want to try that one?

715
00:48:43,561 --> 00:48:45,561
This one looks strong Pat.

716
00:48:47,318 --> 00:48:49,654
I'll try to sit on it.

717
00:48:49,654 --> 00:48:50,950
Try.

718
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:58,120
This is really comfortable.

719
00:49:00,001 --> 00:49:03,906
I could sit at home all day in front of the computer
and not go anywhere.

720
00:49:05,941 --> 00:49:09,398
Including not going to work as well, right?

721
00:49:11,433 --> 00:49:13,433
How can I not go?

722
00:49:14,267 --> 00:49:18,040
If I don't finish my work,
my boss will scold me again.

723
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:27,440
Is your boss mean?

724
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,073
He was.

725
00:49:35,002 --> 00:49:36,000
Cruel.

726
00:49:38,011 --> 00:49:39,115
But now he's not.

727
00:49:42,776 --> 00:49:43,768
Wait a minute.

728
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,445
I'll go find the staff first.

729
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:04,039
You can put on the slippers.

730
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:04,695
Ok.

731
00:50:17,303 --> 00:50:18,600
Where should I place it?

732
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,281
Oh, you can put it here.

733
00:50:26,024 --> 00:50:28,024
Thank you for holding it.

734
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:30,000
No problem, you're welcome.

735
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,600
You have a nice house.

736
00:50:37,423 --> 00:50:38,359
Uh, thank you.

737
00:50:40,734 --> 00:50:42,734
Do you want some water?

738
00:50:44,297 --> 00:50:46,353
It's ok, I'd better leave.

739
00:50:47,575 --> 00:50:48,735
Ok.

740
00:50:57,991 --> 00:50:59,480
Mr. Jeng, are you hungry?

741
00:51:00,776 --> 00:51:01,768
A little bit.

742
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,216
Do you want me to make you something to eat?

743
00:51:07,636 --> 00:51:08,796
Let me help you.

744
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,920
Do you have a kitchen?

745
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:13,053
I do, it's right here.

746
00:51:14,215 --> 00:51:15,151
Ok.

747
00:51:39,281 --> 00:51:40,273
What?

748
00:51:51,707 --> 00:51:52,699
Mr. Jeng.

749
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:54,969
Yes?

750
00:51:55,521 --> 00:51:56,625
Here.

751
00:51:58,289 --> 00:52:01,634
You're a chef so you need to wear a chef's hat.

752
00:52:05,256 --> 00:52:06,528
Could you put it on for me?

753
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:49,970
Where did you get that?

754
00:52:50,361 --> 00:52:53,201
My dad is a chef too.

755
00:52:55,841 --> 00:52:56,840
Really?

756
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,832
Yes.

757
00:53:02,057 --> 00:53:03,105
It's done.

758
00:53:03,105 --> 00:53:03,783
Oh.

759
00:53:09,796 --> 00:53:11,628
Where is your dad a chef?

760
00:53:12,241 --> 00:53:13,681
In America.

761
00:53:17,201 --> 00:53:19,201
Try it, do you like it?

762
00:53:19,201 --> 00:53:20,364
Ok.

763
00:53:27,726 --> 00:53:29,120
How is it?

764
00:53:34,841 --> 00:53:36,449
Ummm.

765
00:53:38,205 --> 00:53:39,560
It's..

766
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:42,206
It's ok.

767
00:53:43,233 --> 00:53:46,522
It's better than most chicken breast.

768
00:53:46,989 --> 00:53:48,989
But it's still chicken breast.

769
00:53:49,534 --> 00:53:52,486
I like other parts, that's more...

770
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:54,226
oily!

771
00:53:56,615 --> 00:53:57,439
Sure.

772
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,944
Do you want to try mine?

773
00:54:02,052 --> 00:54:03,268
Sure.

774
00:54:07,208 --> 00:54:08,648
Let me try it.

775
00:54:17,574 --> 00:54:18,846
How is it?

776
00:54:22,674 --> 00:54:23,834
It's great.

777
00:54:24,805 --> 00:54:26,133
You're over acting.

778
00:54:27,384 --> 00:54:28,544
It really is good.

779
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:30,350
You're really good at this.

780
00:54:31,287 --> 00:54:33,175
It tastes good with MSG.

781
00:54:36,163 --> 00:54:37,827
But it's still good.

782
00:54:42,328 --> 00:54:43,544
Thank you.

783
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:58,292
Aren't you going to try it?

784
00:55:05,544 --> 00:55:06,592
Hmm...

785
00:55:07,731 --> 00:55:09,059
It's really good.

786
00:55:11,156 --> 00:55:12,876
I told you it's good.

787
00:56:15,509 --> 00:56:16,669
What's up Put?

788
00:56:17,528 --> 00:56:21,217
I'm working but I can talk to you.

789
00:56:21,676 --> 00:56:24,320
(Ok, I won't take up your time.)

790
00:56:25,191 --> 00:56:27,191
(Are you free tomorrow evening?)

791
00:56:28,054 --> 00:56:28,990
(Do you want to get dinner?)

792
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:32,353
Ummm.

793
00:56:35,834 --> 00:56:36,770
Where?

794
00:56:37,237 --> 00:56:38,229
(That restaurant.)

795
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,640
(The one I told you
that I was going to take you.)

796
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:41,330
(Do you remember?)

797
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:43,679
Oh, I do.

798
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:46,692
Text me the time.

799
00:56:47,161 --> 00:56:50,225
(Ok, see you. I won't bother your time now.)

800
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,000
Come on.

801
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,047
Put, not yet.

802
00:57:22,353 --> 00:57:23,513
Let me take a picture first.

803
00:57:33,828 --> 00:57:36,600
You still take photos before eating.

804
00:57:38,057 --> 00:57:39,385
Well, it looks good.

805
00:57:39,385 --> 00:57:42,120
All done, you can eat now.

806
00:57:43,151 --> 00:57:45,151
Let me do it for you.

807
00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:52,297
Put in a bit of this.

808
00:57:57,638 --> 00:57:58,600
Thank you.

809
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:05,858
How is it?

810
00:58:06,592 --> 00:58:07,416
Is it good?

811
00:58:08,947 --> 00:58:10,000
It's ok.

812
00:58:11,824 --> 00:58:12,535
Hey.

813
00:58:14,837 --> 00:58:16,333
Are you still angry at me about that?

814
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:20,609
Put.

815
00:58:21,149 --> 00:58:22,960
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

816
00:58:30,731 --> 00:58:31,555
Pat.

817
00:58:33,701 --> 00:58:34,749
I'm sorry.

818
00:58:35,944 --> 00:58:37,496
I wasn't thinking thoroughly.

819
00:58:38,747 --> 00:58:40,000
But I promise you.

820
00:58:40,654 --> 00:58:44,111
That I won't do anything
to make you feel uncomfortable again.

821
00:58:45,285 --> 00:58:47,117
But anything that's important to you

822
00:58:48,004 --> 00:58:49,440
is also important to me.

823
00:58:52,432 --> 00:58:53,592
Good.

824
00:58:55,789 --> 00:58:59,526
When the time comes,
don't disappear from the shoot.

825
00:59:01,057 --> 00:59:03,449
Like you disappeared from my life.

826
00:59:15,555 --> 00:59:17,891
Put, I'm sorry.

827
00:59:22,922 --> 00:59:23,802
It's ok.

828
00:59:27,415 --> 00:59:31,600
Really, it serves me right to be hated by you.

829
00:59:34,298 --> 00:59:35,514
But can I say something?

830
00:59:39,118 --> 00:59:42,799
I'm really sorry that I made you sad at that time.

831
00:59:43,401 --> 00:59:46,746
At that time, I still didn't understand my feelings.

832
00:59:46,746 --> 00:59:47,658
And.

833
00:59:49,731 --> 00:59:54,084
You were my first boyfriend.

834
00:59:54,858 --> 00:59:55,738
So I...

835
00:59:55,738 --> 00:59:57,246
Put, that's enough.

836
00:59:58,419 --> 01:00:02,492
Do you know that this plot is very cliche?

837
01:00:07,044 --> 01:00:07,755
Pat.

838
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:12,639
For someone who has known himself
for a long time.

839
01:00:14,427 --> 01:00:16,259
It may sound unbelievable.

840
01:00:17,609 --> 01:00:18,881
But for me.

841
01:00:20,001 --> 01:00:21,777
I need some time.

842
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:25,821
Until I could accept my feelings.

843
01:00:28,254 --> 01:00:31,150
I've spent a lot of time already.

844
01:00:32,757 --> 01:00:33,861
And.

845
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:38,030
You aren't not waiting for me anymore.

846
01:00:59,192 --> 01:01:00,360
What's wrong?

847
01:01:02,275 --> 01:01:03,435
Nothing.

848
01:01:12,315 --> 01:01:15,659
(Kong: I'm in front of the restaurant.)

849
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:22,702
Who is it?

850
01:01:25,152 --> 01:01:26,256
I'll be right back.

851
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:33,652
What?

852
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,656
What are you doing here?

853
01:01:36,121 --> 01:01:40,754
I was passing through
and saw in your story that you're eating here.

854
01:01:40,754 --> 01:01:42,751
So I came to see you.

855
01:01:42,751 --> 01:01:46,612
Kong, do you want me to be
a member of your MLM team?

856
01:01:47,963 --> 01:01:52,372
No, I just wanted to come say hi.

857
01:01:52,372 --> 01:01:56,439
Did you take the Krill oil I gave you?

858
01:01:57,084 --> 01:01:59,364
This is not my style.

859
01:01:59,761 --> 01:02:04,480
I know that MLM might look bad for some people.

860
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,979
But I want you

861
01:02:06,862 --> 01:02:10,000
to not listen to others because it's not like that at all.

862
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,738
I really mean well for you,
so I wanted to invite you to do it together.

863
01:02:13,738 --> 01:02:16,341
Like I said, you have a lot of potential.

864
01:02:16,845 --> 01:02:19,741
And I want you to open up to this business.

865
01:02:19,741 --> 01:02:21,521
I'm really not interested.

866
01:02:22,711 --> 01:02:25,800
Well, I don't have anything against this business.

867
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:29,309
But do you know?
Your methods are scary.

868
01:02:30,001 --> 01:02:34,242
From the front of the restaurant to my company,
and you followed me here.

869
01:02:35,157 --> 01:02:37,045
It's like you're threatening me.

870
01:02:40,818 --> 01:02:44,160
I didn't think I was scaring you.

871
01:02:44,972 --> 01:02:50,277
Well, I thought that
you were opening up to this business.

872
01:03:02,773 --> 01:03:06,454
Let's just say,
I'm thankful that you spoke directly to me.

873
01:03:07,369 --> 01:03:10,000
From now on, I'm not going to talk about this.

874
01:03:10,956 --> 01:03:12,340
With Ying too?

875
01:03:13,087 --> 01:03:14,359
And other people too?

876
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:17,890
I think you have to change your ways.

877
01:03:18,685 --> 01:03:20,685
This is too much.

878
01:03:20,685 --> 01:03:23,287
Ok, I understand.

879
01:03:24,434 --> 01:03:25,600
I'm sorry.

880
01:03:28,206 --> 01:03:29,534
I'm going now.

881
01:03:30,755 --> 01:03:32,195
See you soon.

882
01:03:44,894 --> 01:03:45,718
Pat.

883
01:03:48,174 --> 01:03:49,054
Are you ok?

884
01:03:54,627 --> 01:03:56,459
Come on, let's go inside.

885
01:04:07,178 --> 01:04:08,226
Who was that?

886
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:10,590
Can you tell me?

887
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:13,472
This was the guy

888
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:17,320
that you helped acted for me that day.

889
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:18,377
Oh.

890
01:04:20,173 --> 01:04:22,173
He's still coming after you?

891
01:04:23,092 --> 01:04:24,252
Yeah.

892
01:04:24,973 --> 01:04:26,973
But I told me no.

893
01:04:27,601 --> 01:04:30,600
I think he understood me.

894
01:04:31,246 --> 01:04:34,310
I thought it would be harder.

895
01:04:37,018 --> 01:04:39,298
Come on, or it won't be hot anymore.

896
01:04:46,208 --> 01:04:49,104
Can I ask you something that might seem rude?

897
01:04:49,921 --> 01:04:53,840
Who was that man who came up to our office?

898
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:56,948
He seems strange.

899
01:04:57,116 --> 01:05:01,021
Oh, he was someone I knew from America.

900
01:05:03,124 --> 01:05:07,360
It seems he wants to get me into his MLM business.

901
01:05:10,675 --> 01:05:12,171
Don't get the wrong idea.

902
01:05:12,806 --> 01:05:15,366
I don't hate that kind of business.

903
01:05:15,878 --> 01:05:21,464
But I don't like his methods.

904
01:05:21,812 --> 01:05:23,644
It's a bit scary.

905
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:26,593
And he just came up himself that day.

906
01:05:27,984 --> 01:05:30,432
How did he get into our office?

907
01:05:32,802 --> 01:05:34,186
I have no idea.

908
01:05:34,567 --> 01:05:37,295
Maybe he lied that he was delivering something.

909
01:05:39,443 --> 01:05:42,059
I think this is an invasion of personal space.

910
01:05:42,918 --> 01:05:44,918
Have you straight up told him no?

911
01:05:50,603 --> 01:05:52,435
You're scared you might hurt his feelings?

912
01:05:55,591 --> 01:05:57,591
Can I give you some advice?

913
01:05:58,195 --> 01:05:59,075
Sure.

914
01:05:59,075 --> 01:06:02,619
Try being straightforward with him.

915
01:06:02,619 --> 01:06:04,853
So he'll know that you're not ok with it.

916
01:06:04,853 --> 01:06:07,223
If he still doesn't stop.

917
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:10,000
We'll find a way to fix this.

918
01:06:12,199 --> 01:06:14,143
I'll try.

919
01:06:15,313 --> 01:06:16,193
Ok.

920
01:06:17,725 --> 01:06:21,014
You can tell me anything.

921
01:06:34,153 --> 01:06:35,705
What are you looking at?

922
01:06:35,705 --> 01:06:37,425
Stop looking!

923
01:06:37,878 --> 01:06:39,094
Nothing.

924
01:06:39,769 --> 01:06:40,593
Well..

925
01:06:42,545 --> 01:06:43,929
I just wanted to say,

926
01:06:45,327 --> 01:06:46,599
you've really gotten better.

927
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:49,346
What?

928
01:06:49,346 --> 01:06:50,440
Do you mean my bad attitude?

929
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,080
No!

930
01:06:53,945 --> 01:06:57,962
Normally, you're not capable of saying no.

931
01:06:59,437 --> 01:07:01,437
It was really recent.

932
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:05,947
Pat.

933
01:07:13,682 --> 01:07:16,411
Just that scares me.

934
01:07:19,174 --> 01:07:22,350
I'm scared you're going to reject me.

935
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:32,248
You haven't asked me for anything.

936
01:07:40,992 --> 01:07:44,960
Pat? Are you going to turn down Put?

937
01:07:46,204 --> 01:07:48,372
Hey! It's Sharky!

938
01:07:49,287 --> 01:07:50,727
Did you finish it?

939
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:52,527
It took me so long to finish it.

940
01:07:53,162 --> 01:07:54,994
It's so cute!
Can I touch it?

941
01:07:54,994 --> 01:07:55,494
Hey!

942
01:07:58,012 --> 01:07:59,676
I won't let you touch me!

943
01:08:00,407 --> 01:08:02,183
If you want to touch me...

944
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:04,426
you have to answer Put first.

945
01:08:14,025 --> 01:08:15,072
Pat.

946
01:08:18,869 --> 01:08:20,589
Can I have another chance?

947
01:08:24,778 --> 01:08:26,554
I really want to start over with you.

948
01:08:36,351 --> 01:08:37,679
Start over?

949
01:08:41,549 --> 01:08:43,213
If you're ok with that.

950
01:08:45,613 --> 01:08:47,613
You can take Sharky home with you.

951
01:09:21,971 --> 01:09:23,019
Pat, do you like me?

952
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,079
What is Jian Group thinking?

953
01:09:32,079 --> 01:09:35,720
Using an unprofessional child
to work on this big project.

954
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:36,792
Jaab.

955
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,240
Can I talk to you?

956
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:41,540
You don't need to say anything more Jen.

957
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,680
You can text me.

958
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,692
It's ok.
