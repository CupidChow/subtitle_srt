1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,173
What Ying did was wrong,

2
00:00:02,564 --> 00:00:04,049
for putting the blame on you.

3
00:00:04,335 --> 00:00:06,564
I think you should be more calm,

4
00:00:06,564 --> 00:00:10,915
and you should learn how to control your emotions,
like people who have maturity do.

5
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:11,725
Pat.

6
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:15,975
Pat! Wait!

7
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:16,488
Pat!

8
00:00:16,962 --> 00:00:19,648
Can I ask? Where did I make a mistake?

9
00:00:20,274 --> 00:00:21,359
So that I can improve myself.

10
00:00:22,593 --> 00:00:24,421
You can be fired!

11
00:00:24,938 --> 00:00:25,966
Send it!!

12
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:11,427
Pui.

13
00:01:13,184 --> 00:01:14,841
Can I ask you a favor?

14
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:17,156
Is there a way...

15
00:01:17,156 --> 00:01:18,285
to retrieve the assessment back,

16
00:01:18,285 --> 00:01:19,274
before the recipient opens the email?

17
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:24,688
The system automatically sends it into Mr.Jeng's inbox.

18
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:27,418
Don't worry.

19
00:01:28,612 --> 00:01:31,241
The name will never be disclosed.

20
00:01:44,008 --> 00:01:44,578
Pat.

21
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:45,078
Yes.

22
00:01:45,627 --> 00:01:46,598
Are you all right?

23
00:01:47,424 --> 00:01:48,452
Nothing.

24
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:02,457
(Pat: Ae, should I avoid Mr. Jeng or ask him frankly?)

25
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:06,098
(Pat: What if he's seen my assessment?)

26
00:02:06,098 --> 00:02:09,127
(Pat: He hasn't said anything yet.
So he probably hasn't seen it?)

27
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:12,328
(Pat: Or he has, but he's playing it cool?)

28
00:02:13,992 --> 00:02:15,535
I've informed Mr. Rit.

29
00:02:21,127 --> 00:02:21,983
He's ok with that.

30
00:02:21,983 --> 00:02:22,483
Thanks.

31
00:02:34,812 --> 00:02:39,628
Pat, you've whined about this stuff to me for a week.

32
00:02:39,628 --> 00:02:43,572
If you want to know, just ask him frankly like a brave man.

33
00:02:43,572 --> 00:02:47,389
Or please do something!!

34
00:02:51,141 --> 00:02:53,141
So that's all for today's updates.

35
00:02:53,732 --> 00:02:56,132
Wish you the best on this weekend.

36
00:03:01,496 --> 00:03:02,295
Let me go to the toilet first.

37
00:03:02,295 --> 00:03:03,258
Ok, let's meet at the parking lot.

38
00:03:12,156 --> 00:03:13,298
Mr. Jeng.

39
00:03:13,912 --> 00:03:14,412
Yes.

40
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:19,296
Well, I've got something to consult you.

41
00:03:20,413 --> 00:03:20,926
Yes.

42
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:25,957
It's about the assessment last week.

43
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,216
Well, I...

44
00:03:30,802 --> 00:03:32,173
Oh, I'm sorry.

45
00:03:32,728 --> 00:03:34,671
I haven't had time to read it yet.

46
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:40,000
Really? So can I resend it again?

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,673
I think I might've forgotten to include a few things.

48
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:47,003
Yes, you can. So you can talk with Pui about this.

49
00:04:48,147 --> 00:04:49,689
And make it fade to black.

50
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:52,339
The end!

51
00:04:53,571 --> 00:04:54,599
That's all for the plot.

52
00:04:55,193 --> 00:04:57,193
Wow!

53
00:05:00,838 --> 00:05:01,752
Wait,

54
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:03,953
does it need to be that sad?

55
00:05:04,394 --> 00:05:08,338
It's totally far-flung from the client's brief.

56
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:11,355
I thought the actor of the music video
was so close to death.

57
00:05:12,315 --> 00:05:14,201
I felt so sad for him.

58
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,913
Right. he loves her and tries to make himself visible,

59
00:05:17,913 --> 00:05:19,170
but finally she doesn't care.

60
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:22,130
Sigh! Is he a human or air?

61
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,739
I think he's PM2.5.

62
00:05:25,042 --> 00:05:26,585
By breathing in his vibe,
I feel like my lungs are getting hurt.

63
00:05:26,586 --> 00:05:28,529
What the heck is wrong with you guys?

64
00:05:32,274 --> 00:05:32,959
Jaab.

65
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,595
Hey, are you sick?

66
00:05:36,674 --> 00:05:38,102
I think you should see a doctor.

67
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,510
Do you have a fever?

68
00:05:48,929 --> 00:05:54,703
Does it need to be this sad,
the work I brainstormed with you yesterday?

69
00:05:55,157 --> 00:05:56,356
It has nothing to do with you.

70
00:05:57,821 --> 00:05:59,021
I just suck.

71
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:02,549
I can't believe that Jaab of Baan Jay,

72
00:06:02,549 --> 00:06:05,532
would be able come up with a sad idea like this.

73
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:10,893
Well, usually he can,

74
00:06:10,893 --> 00:06:14,007
but it's all about nonsense.

75
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:19,729
Who on earth can see the world through
rose colored glasses like you now, Jen?

76
00:06:21,306 --> 00:06:23,306
Is that obvious?

77
00:06:26,425 --> 00:06:27,224
What's wrong?

78
00:06:27,727 --> 00:06:28,227
Hey!

79
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,000
Hey! Hey!

80
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:31,861
What's wrong with you?

81
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,627
Wait, wait, wait.

82
00:06:40,628 --> 00:06:41,128
Wait!

83
00:06:41,828 --> 00:06:44,629
OMG! Aren't you running away
to the toilet to cry alone there?

84
00:06:47,547 --> 00:06:49,204
Shut up!

85
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,930
I...

86
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:54,211
will retrieve the same old Jaab back here,

87
00:06:55,006 --> 00:06:56,205
just watch.

88
00:06:56,701 --> 00:06:58,815
You should bring tissue paper with you, not a pen.

89
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,000
Shut up!

90
00:07:02,228 --> 00:07:03,885
I think he's way too much, seriously.

91
00:07:20,596 --> 00:07:22,139
Why do you look so sad like this?

92
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,738
Wanna drink with me a bit?

93
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:31,200
A glass, please.

94
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:35,174
Come on, boy.

95
00:07:43,222 --> 00:07:44,250
Whoa!

96
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,440
I thought I would call for you to consult,

97
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:49,546
but you seem much more troubled than me.

98
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:52,001
but you seem much more troubled than me.

99
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:55,461
Are you crazy?

100
00:07:56,107 --> 00:07:58,050
A guy like you wants to consult me?

101
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:00,604
Mr. Kittipong. Mr. Perfect.

102
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:05,743
You've never seen me
for any consultation for a thousand year!

103
00:08:07,803 --> 00:08:09,803
So let me begin from this day on.

104
00:08:13,418 --> 00:08:15,418
Jaab, listen.

105
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:21,834
What kind of person am I?

106
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,289
Micromanage?

107
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:26,093
Do I lack empathy? Or am I narcissistic?

108
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:34,663
Whao! Are you sick, bro?

109
00:08:36,237 --> 00:08:37,379
Do you have a cold or something?

110
00:08:37,782 --> 00:08:40,353
Who told you these? They're just on point!

111
00:08:40,672 --> 00:08:43,187
Are they a fortune teller? I really want them to read me.

112
00:08:44,865 --> 00:08:48,466
Hey, am I really like that?

113
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:53,582
Exactly.

114
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:56,042
Being with you is very hard.

115
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,187
I have to try to let it go many times.

116
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,147
So what's your problem?

117
00:09:16,887 --> 00:09:19,116
Do you know how to stop your feelings for someone?

118
00:09:21,306 --> 00:09:21,806
Why?

119
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,209
Do you have a crush on someone again?

120
00:09:24,806 --> 00:09:26,806
What? No!

121
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:30,276
It has to do with one of my team members.

122
00:09:31,123 --> 00:09:32,608
Just do it like I do.

123
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:39,234
So now I've become the boss every subordinate hates.

124
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:43,581
It's not like the boss-subordinate relationship.

125
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:46,643
It's more about friends.

126
00:09:50,785 --> 00:09:52,785
So it actually has to do with you, isn't it?

127
00:09:54,932 --> 00:09:56,417
Why did you say it doesn't?

128
00:09:56,665 --> 00:09:58,665
Yes, it does.

129
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:03,545
But he's already taken.

130
00:10:04,506 --> 00:10:05,591
Are you happy now?

131
00:10:10,284 --> 00:10:12,856
I don't see why you need to move on so quickly.

132
00:10:14,261 --> 00:10:18,148
It's just temporary infatuation.

133
00:10:18,774 --> 00:10:21,918
After a while, it will just pass, Jaab.

134
00:10:22,893 --> 00:10:24,607
So how long does it take?

135
00:10:27,388 --> 00:10:30,000
I don’t know. It depends on each person.

136
00:10:30,592 --> 00:10:32,592
But if you guys spend more time together,

137
00:10:33,413 --> 00:10:35,299
and know each other better,

138
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:38,271
you'll see what you don't like about each other,

139
00:10:38,631 --> 00:10:41,889
and then you'll just stop liking him.

140
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:46,809
Come on.

141
00:10:48,468 --> 00:10:49,439
Cheers!

142
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:51,640
Yeah.

143
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:18,637
What do I do?

144
00:11:48,527 --> 00:11:49,383
Bring it on.

145
00:11:49,615 --> 00:11:51,615
He told me to spend time with him.

146
00:11:57,752 --> 00:11:58,437
Oh my!

147
00:12:10,624 --> 00:12:11,124
Hello.

148
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:15,829
(Jen: What's up, Jaab?)

149
00:12:21,849 --> 00:12:23,048
Jen...

150
00:12:23,488 --> 00:12:27,089
are you free tomorrow?

151
00:12:28,156 --> 00:12:32,786
I want to invite you to
Tae's birthday party at Pearl&Oliver with me.

152
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:36,862
Can you go with me?

153
00:12:38,315 --> 00:12:39,171
(Jen: Jaab,)

154
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:40,872
(Jen: I'm not available.)

155
00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:46,203
(Jen: I'm going on a date with Mon.)

156
00:12:49,665 --> 00:12:52,065
Wll, I see.

157
00:12:54,564 --> 00:12:56,564
I made it a bit too urgent.

158
00:12:57,544 --> 00:13:00,459
So I won't disturb you now. Sweet dream.

159
00:13:12,697 --> 00:13:14,697
Why are you brooding over this, Jaab?

160
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,900
It's normal for one to go on a date on weekends.

161
00:13:20,802 --> 00:13:22,230
Damn it!

162
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:32,067
Jaab.

163
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,058
Jaab, the door is unlocked. Can I get inside?

164
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:44,927
Jaab, can I borrow your charger?

165
00:13:44,927 --> 00:13:46,927
What a shame!

166
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:52,853
What have I done? They'll be weekend dating.

167
00:13:53,062 --> 00:13:54,547
Whao!

168
00:13:54,932 --> 00:13:56,932
It's getting sadder than it was.

169
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:02,269
It was all your fault!

170
00:14:04,763 --> 00:14:06,477
So that's fine.

171
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:08,821
I think I should buy a new charger for myself.

172
00:14:09,662 --> 00:14:10,747
See you, Jaab.

173
00:14:15,903 --> 00:14:17,674
What a shame!

174
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:21,049
I really shouldn't have know that.

175
00:14:43,405 --> 00:14:47,006
(Jen: Hey, Mon is tied up with work.)

176
00:14:47,006 --> 00:14:48,821
(Jen: So I can go with you now.)

177
00:15:05,611 --> 00:15:07,611
Calm down, Jaab.

178
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,904
Tomorrow at 6 p.m.

179
00:15:16,574 --> 00:15:18,460
Do you want me to pick you up?

180
00:15:27,332 --> 00:15:30,000
(Jen: No, thanks. I will grab a car myself.)

181
00:15:30,283 --> 00:15:32,283
(Jen: By the way, is it formal?)

182
00:15:32,853 --> 00:15:34,167
(Jen: Do I need to wear a suit?)

183
00:15:45,366 --> 00:15:48,167
I like white and pink shirts.

184
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,398
You look so cute with them.

185
00:15:57,002 --> 00:15:57,858
(Jen: Really? Now I'm blushing!)

186
00:15:58,168 --> 00:15:59,367
(Jen: Now I'm blushing!)

187
00:15:59,674 --> 00:16:01,388
(Jen: Mon also told me this.)

188
00:16:05,057 --> 00:16:05,799
(Jen: So...)

189
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:08,778
(Jen: it seems like we're going on a date, right?)

190
00:16:10,001 --> 00:16:12,401
(Jen: Hey, are you feeling for me?)

191
00:16:20,766 --> 00:16:24,253
We'll be together now.

192
00:16:24,253 --> 00:16:26,019
I really don't know what to do.

193
00:16:26,506 --> 00:16:27,820
Omg..

194
00:17:00,693 --> 00:17:01,950
Hello, everyone.

195
00:17:02,411 --> 00:17:03,839
Hello.

196
00:17:05,073 --> 00:17:07,645
Today I really want to thank you guys,

197
00:17:07,645 --> 00:17:09,759
for coming to my birthday party.

198
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:13,646
And I appreciate your presents.

199
00:17:16,012 --> 00:17:17,840
So when you pass my restaurant,

200
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,784
you can stop by and have a meal here.
You're welcome.

201
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,255
Today Tae is so handsome.

202
00:17:28,508 --> 00:17:31,652
Exactly. He looks so charming with that suit.

203
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:32,152
Right.

204
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:32,652
Thank you.

205
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:35,808
He looks good. But how about you today?

206
00:17:35,808 --> 00:17:36,308
Why?

207
00:17:36,647 --> 00:17:40,420
You're so well-dressed like a rich boy.

208
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:40,920
That's right.

209
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,706
Really?

210
00:17:41,706 --> 00:17:42,676
Look at the colors.

211
00:17:42,676 --> 00:17:44,144
So cute, so cute.

212
00:17:44,144 --> 00:17:45,616
Thanks.

213
00:17:46,574 --> 00:17:48,002
That's a prank on Tae, isn't it?

214
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:48,502
Why?

215
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:50,948
The die-cut line just makes his face look pallid and blurry.

216
00:17:50,948 --> 00:17:51,448
OMG!

217
00:17:51,448 --> 00:17:54,102
I could hardly have known that was him.

218
00:17:54,102 --> 00:17:55,038
It's not my fault.

219
00:17:55,361 --> 00:17:58,447
His friend and business partner briefed me like this, so I just followed it.

220
00:17:58,607 --> 00:18:02,437
See? You can still see him. He just sent it all to me.

221
00:18:02,437 --> 00:18:03,904
I've just seen it as well.

222
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:09,312
I didn't do it. Your friend sent it to me.

223
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,358
I didn't do it. Your friend sent it to me.

224
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:19,411
Or did he want to surprise you, Tae?

225
00:18:19,411 --> 00:18:23,483
Like he wanted to make you happy,
when you see a thing like this?

226
00:18:23,483 --> 00:18:24,037
My friend?

227
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:25,751
Which one?

228
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,504
Which one?
Beam, The one you talked to back then!

229
00:18:29,504 --> 00:18:31,247
Ah, that one.

230
00:18:31,247 --> 00:18:32,633
Yeah, that one.

231
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:35,019
You look really good and charming in person.

232
00:18:35,631 --> 00:18:36,373
Right.

233
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,261
Right, Ae? Right, Beam?

234
00:18:38,261 --> 00:18:39,585
Right. You look so good.

235
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,579
Quite right, quite right.

236
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:44,494
That's good, bro.

237
00:18:45,952 --> 00:18:47,838
Anyway, thank you so much, Ae.

238
00:18:47,838 --> 00:18:50,579
For your organization of my party. It's really ok.

239
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:51,898
Ooh! You're very welcome.

240
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:54,893
So can you take photos around here for me, please?

241
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:58,073
Yes.
I'll post them on my restaurant's page to promote it.

242
00:18:58,073 --> 00:19:00,936
I'll take good care of it. I assure you they must be perfect.

243
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,201
So, please.

244
00:19:02,201 --> 00:19:03,377
Yes. Happy Birthday!

245
00:19:03,377 --> 00:19:04,557
Ok. Thank you.

246
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:06,009
Thank you.

247
00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:07,296
Make yourself at home. Excuse me.

248
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:07,796
Ok.

249
00:19:08,825 --> 00:19:09,655
Yes.

250
00:19:12,546 --> 00:19:13,460
Cheers!

251
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,212
Cheers!

252
00:19:14,502 --> 00:19:15,987
I almost died.

253
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,054
Come on.

254
00:19:20,197 --> 00:19:20,939
So good.

255
00:19:20,939 --> 00:19:21,510
It's good now?

256
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,494
Get closer a bit.

257
00:19:23,748 --> 00:19:25,005
Good. It's good now.

258
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:26,339
One more, please.

259
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:27,279
Ok. Come on.

260
00:19:28,445 --> 00:19:30,000
Excellent.

261
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:34,154
It's only you who tricked me into this.

262
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:37,218
You never told me we had to help them take the photos.

263
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:39,488
It's not my fault!

264
00:19:40,693 --> 00:19:41,892
It's you, Kanun.

265
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:44,215
You just told me right when we entered the party.

266
00:19:44,689 --> 00:19:49,891
I didn't see it coming either!
The photographer Ae had hired canceled it this morning.

267
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,420
Oh my gosh!

268
00:19:52,218 --> 00:19:53,532
And look at my outfit.

269
00:19:54,464 --> 00:19:56,064
Does it fit the party?

270
00:19:56,434 --> 00:19:57,462
What a shame!

271
00:19:57,771 --> 00:19:59,771
Come on...

272
00:20:00,691 --> 00:20:02,863
I think you should push your hair back a bit.

273
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:05,584
Stop bothering me. Do your hair first.

274
00:20:07,977 --> 00:20:09,176
Good. Gorgeous.

275
00:20:09,462 --> 00:20:11,233
Ok. Beautiful.

276
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:11,733
Oops!

277
00:20:12,965 --> 00:20:14,050
Have you uploaded the photos?

278
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:17,443
Wait, let me check them out with my subordinates first.

279
00:20:19,423 --> 00:20:20,000
What?

280
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,357
You're just acting all high and mighty, boy.

281
00:20:21,819 --> 00:20:23,476
It can't be helped. My wifey is right here.

282
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:26,974
Hello, I'm Jen.

283
00:20:27,356 --> 00:20:30,500
I'm Jaab's and Kanun's co-worker.

284
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,834
Thank you for helping me.

285
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:36,412
But don't you tell me you were fooled by these two jerks?

286
00:20:37,212 --> 00:20:39,498
Whao, who fooled him?

287
00:20:39,736 --> 00:20:41,736
I'm the one who is always fooled.

288
00:20:41,966 --> 00:20:44,938
I'm always fooled into snapping photos in these and those events.

289
00:20:45,384 --> 00:20:48,756
Let me tell you.
You're my girlfriend, but this time you have to pay me.

290
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:51,013
I know. I'll pay you. Ok?

291
00:20:51,703 --> 00:20:53,875
Share it with Jen and me, too.

292
00:20:54,249 --> 00:20:55,162
I know.

293
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:57,714
I always share the money with you.
Have I ever suckered you?

294
00:20:58,088 --> 00:21:00,000
I always see you guys as "suckers" for each other.

295
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,517
What?!

296
00:21:03,214 --> 00:21:05,671
Doesn’t it mean "sucker each other into getting no money"?

297
00:21:06,922 --> 00:21:07,836
Ahhh!

298
00:21:08,553 --> 00:21:10,000
In that sense.

299
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,828
Keep taking photos.

300
00:21:12,124 --> 00:21:14,124
Are you a sucker? Oh, no!

301
00:21:14,124 --> 00:21:14,906
Come on, so I can take a snap for you.

302
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,508
Yeah, good.

303
00:21:17,882 --> 00:21:19,196
Beautiful.

304
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:21,086
Ok.

305
00:21:32,052 --> 00:21:34,052
So could you get into the kitchen,

306
00:21:34,052 --> 00:21:36,166
and check what hasn't been stored in the fridge?

307
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:39,138
And please keep it into the fridge for me.

308
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,431
And you, please check if those in the exterior zone
have got everything they want.

309
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:48,803
I'm not sure if every guest has already got the drinks.

310
00:21:48,803 --> 00:21:50,799
So please serve them.

311
00:21:51,108 --> 00:21:56,939
In the back are two bottles of wine
that still have been left opened.

312
00:21:57,247 --> 00:22:00,333
Ouch! Why did you bump into me?

313
00:22:00,723 --> 00:22:02,723
No, I didn't. I didn't bump into you.

314
00:22:02,723 --> 00:22:05,897
How dare you talk back to me? You just did it!

315
00:22:06,168 --> 00:22:07,425
You must take the responsibility.

316
00:22:07,425 --> 00:22:08,677
I didn't do that.

317
00:22:09,258 --> 00:22:11,200
How dare you deny it?

318
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:26,852
Mr. Jeng, you just can't keep haunting me up
to the weekend like this.

319
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,904
How are you doing? Are you drunk?

320
00:22:31,191 --> 00:22:33,191
Noooo!

321
00:22:33,607 --> 00:22:36,408
Anyone who hasn't been drunk can stay longer.

322
00:22:36,408 --> 00:22:39,439
But for those who want to go now, get home safely.

323
00:22:39,439 --> 00:22:41,548
But for those who want to go now, get home safely.

324
00:22:42,048 --> 00:22:43,577
Thank you so much for today.

325
00:22:46,887 --> 00:22:48,601
Tae is really handsome.

326
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:52,538
Hello, Kanun.

327
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:58,683
Kanun! Stand up!

328
00:22:58,796 --> 00:22:59,424
He's poking you!

329
00:22:59,424 --> 00:23:00,595
Stand up! He's sitting there!

330
00:23:01,742 --> 00:23:02,713
There you go, Pat.

331
00:23:02,713 --> 00:23:03,213
There you go.

332
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,235
Sit down.

333
00:23:05,235 --> 00:23:06,079
My wifey must be at ease.

334
00:23:06,414 --> 00:23:07,327
Thank you, Kanun.

335
00:23:07,327 --> 00:23:08,011
Are you ok?

336
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:08,988
Yes, I am.

337
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:10,575
Good. Let him sit and feel comfy.

338
00:23:12,441 --> 00:23:13,183
Are you drunk?

339
00:23:13,465 --> 00:23:14,436
No, I'm not.

340
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:16,808
How are you, guys? Are you drunk?

341
00:23:16,808 --> 00:23:17,506
No, we're not.

342
00:23:17,506 --> 00:23:18,578
Let's give a toast.

343
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:19,675
Let's give a toast.

344
00:23:20,763 --> 00:23:21,276
Cheers!

345
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:21,776
I'm working now!

346
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:22,276
Ah, ok.

347
00:23:27,453 --> 00:23:29,167
Are these all your friends, Tae?

348
00:23:29,378 --> 00:23:33,951
Yes. When I was studying in the U.S.,
I kept  around to try foods there,

349
00:23:34,097 --> 00:23:37,126
with the plan to open a restaurant in Thailand.

350
00:23:37,219 --> 00:23:38,762
Now there are six partners.

351
00:23:39,027 --> 00:23:41,427
Jeng and I are the main oversees here.

352
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:43,338
Ahhh.

353
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,032
Hey, is he the same one as Mr. Jeng?

354
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:50,389
Well, Pat usually takes me here
because he said it's near his office.

355
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:52,109
And he often passes this place.

356
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:55,747
So he's seen the restaurant ever since
it was constructed up to when it's been opened.

357
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,732
Well, the location is near my home,
including Jeng's and my offices.

358
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:04,403
So we can come here and take care of it after work.

359
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:06,343
Good, bro.

360
00:24:08,086 --> 00:24:10,086
Pat, what's wrong?

361
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:11,884
Are you all right?

362
00:24:12,923 --> 00:24:13,951
Are you drunk?

363
00:24:14,826 --> 00:24:17,169
Pat, you look so red and dull. Are you drunk?

364
00:24:19,407 --> 00:24:20,263
What a hard worker you are!

365
00:24:20,263 --> 00:24:22,034
You hired me to work, didn't you?

366
00:24:22,933 --> 00:24:23,675
Are you all right?

367
00:24:23,675 --> 00:24:24,495
Your face is so red.

368
00:24:24,495 --> 00:24:25,274
Good, right?

369
00:24:25,274 --> 00:24:27,989
Here is the surprise for those,
who are waiting for the after party!

370
00:24:28,275 --> 00:24:31,190
Now Pearl & Oliver,

371
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,604
has a gift for every of you guys.

372
00:24:33,604 --> 00:24:36,185
A 5,000 baht voucher!

373
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,375
You think it's too little, right? Not at all!

374
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,073
Because we'll be giving a voucher for everyone!

375
00:24:42,668 --> 00:24:44,413
Only for the tables with the remaining guests, though.

376
00:24:44,413 --> 00:24:45,327
One for each?

377
00:24:45,327 --> 00:24:46,200
One for each.

378
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:46,907
5,000 baht for each.

379
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,378
5,000 baht for each.

380
00:24:48,378 --> 00:24:49,586
We're five, so it's 25,000 bath!

381
00:24:50,928 --> 00:24:51,784
Bring it on!

382
00:24:51,784 --> 00:24:52,761
But...

383
00:24:52,761 --> 00:24:54,981
this is the game for only hard cores.

384
00:24:55,216 --> 00:24:58,874
Because the rule is that everyone
at the same table must drink,

385
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,974
and answer three questions correctly.

386
00:25:01,277 --> 00:25:04,135
Any group that gets them done first will just get the prize!

387
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,732
Join us, Tae. Help me first.

388
00:25:08,075 --> 00:25:08,575
Can I?

389
00:25:08,575 --> 00:25:09,075
Yeah.

390
00:25:09,075 --> 00:25:10,250
I'm the restaurant's owner.

391
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,728
Come on, bro. Just for fun.

392
00:25:12,948 --> 00:25:15,920
Whao! They're just grouping up!

393
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,407
Tae, can you get the staff in the kitchen to help me?

394
00:25:19,407 --> 00:25:19,907
Seriously?

395
00:25:19,907 --> 00:25:20,777
Take that!

396
00:25:20,777 --> 00:25:22,257
So wait for a second.

397
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,130
I'm calling my friend here.

398
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,615
Ae, are you broke or something?

399
00:25:24,615 --> 00:25:26,819
Don't you want a 5,000 baht voucher?

400
00:25:27,182 --> 00:25:31,069
Hello, how's the kitchen, Jeng? Is that ok?

401
00:25:31,069 --> 00:25:32,931
Are there any orders left? Have they been all done?

402
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:37,028
Well, my junior peers need your help her.
So please come to the front.

403
00:25:37,028 --> 00:25:38,690
Okay. See you then.

404
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,467
I've told him that.

405
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,110
Sorry for bothering you.

406
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:42,610
That's fine.

407
00:25:42,867 --> 00:25:44,410
10,000 baht for two!

408
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,366
Yeah, I'll get 5,000 baht.

409
00:25:46,366 --> 00:25:47,379
That'll be mine.

410
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:50,000
Ah, here he comes.

411
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,260
Hey! This way, Jeng!

412
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:10,422
This is my friend.

413
00:26:10,995 --> 00:26:14,539
He's Jeng. He's also my restaurant's partner

414
00:26:14,802 --> 00:26:16,573
and the head chief.

415
00:26:16,573 --> 00:26:20,000
He was the one who made
the delicious food we ate today.

416
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,500
Wow!

417
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,000
Hello.

418
00:26:21,245 --> 00:26:21,745
Hello.

419
00:26:22,277 --> 00:26:25,592
Ohho, it's such an honor, Jeng.

420
00:26:25,592 --> 00:26:26,896
The food was really good.

421
00:26:26,896 --> 00:26:27,758
Thank you.

422
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,188
If every table is ready, let's begin.

423
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:37,407
The rule is everyone must drink 10 shots in a row,

424
00:26:37,407 --> 00:26:39,791
before we move on to the questions.

425
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:40,610
Are you all right?

426
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,722
Wow! Fine!

427
00:26:41,722 --> 00:26:42,639
Ready?

428
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,300
Go!

429
00:26:45,153 --> 00:26:46,035
Hey, do I go first?

430
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:50,092
I'm already drunk, Ae.

431
00:26:50,092 --> 00:26:51,371
Why are you just standing doing nothing?!

432
00:26:55,688 --> 00:26:56,600
Give it to me!

433
00:26:59,616 --> 00:27:00,301
Done!

434
00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:04,313
Done!

435
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:09,076
The warm up session is done,
so here is the first question.

436
00:27:09,476 --> 00:27:12,848
When was Pearl & Oliver first opened?

437
00:27:13,037 --> 00:27:16,160
If you're ready, drink a shot and raise your hand!

438
00:27:18,883 --> 00:27:20,000
30 January!

439
00:27:20,257 --> 00:27:21,628
Or February?

440
00:27:22,314 --> 00:27:23,113
30 February doesn't exist.

441
00:27:23,113 --> 00:27:24,881
30 January 2022!

442
00:27:24,881 --> 00:27:26,121
Correct!

443
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:29,034
Good job!

444
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:32,520
You're a cheater, Ae?

445
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,020
Why?

446
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,477
You have the restaurant's owner in your team.

447
00:27:35,477 --> 00:27:36,242
All right, all right.

448
00:27:36,242 --> 00:27:38,681
Here is an additional rule.

449
00:27:38,681 --> 00:27:41,281
Anyone who's got a question right,

450
00:27:41,281 --> 00:27:44,326
can't answer the next one.

451
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,520
But it's cheating, isn't it?

452
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,903
That's fine! It's 5,000 baht!

453
00:27:48,826 --> 00:27:52,198
But hold on. We have a surprise,
from our Tae the Prodigal.

454
00:27:52,198 --> 00:27:56,481
The voucher will be revalued to 15,000 baht!

455
00:27:57,337 --> 00:27:58,250
15,000 baht?

456
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,080
15,000 baht?!

457
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:02,400
There you go.

458
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,822
Have fun, guys.

459
00:28:03,822 --> 00:28:04,322
Yeah.

460
00:28:04,322 --> 00:28:05,768
Stay on. Excuse me.

461
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:08,607
Where are you going, Tae? Be with us.

462
00:28:08,607 --> 00:28:10,232
Don't bother him!

463
00:28:10,232 --> 00:28:11,805
Let me do his business.

464
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:13,738
So let me help you.

465
00:28:13,738 --> 00:28:16,200
Wow! How Great! Welcome, Jeng!

466
00:28:16,473 --> 00:28:16,973
Welcome.

467
00:28:18,026 --> 00:28:23,228
The next question is,
"What is a must-have menu of the restaurant?"

468
00:28:23,481 --> 00:28:25,600
What?! Everything is just good! So what is that?

469
00:28:26,116 --> 00:28:26,859
Everything is good here.

470
00:28:26,859 --> 00:28:27,372
Ummm.

471
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,000
I remember eating...

472
00:28:37,357 --> 00:28:39,520
Milk ice cream with glass jelly is good.

473
00:28:40,001 --> 00:28:42,115
No. Savory food?

474
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:44,537
Ah!

475
00:28:45,961 --> 00:28:47,618
German pork knuckles!

476
00:28:47,942 --> 00:28:50,914
Correct!

477
00:28:53,761 --> 00:28:55,000
I'm gonna take their photos.

478
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,705
Don’t!

479
00:28:56,721 --> 00:29:00,000
And here is the last question.

480
00:29:00,178 --> 00:29:02,178
But before that,

481
00:29:02,361 --> 00:29:04,600
here is another additional rule.

482
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,030
Every table must drink ten shots in a row.

483
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:10,478
We can't lose our dignity.

484
00:29:10,478 --> 00:29:12,433
For 15,000 baht! Don't give up!

485
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,439
You're not even easy on us.

486
00:29:17,332 --> 00:29:18,989
When it comes to drinking games, I never give up.

487
00:29:18,989 --> 00:29:19,561
Please put this away.

488
00:29:19,561 --> 00:29:21,786
Ready? Go!

489
00:29:22,724 --> 00:29:25,200
Go! Drink with two hands, Ae! One is not enough!

490
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,705
Help me! Don't be a chicken!

491
00:29:30,381 --> 00:29:31,123
Let me help you.

492
00:29:31,758 --> 00:29:32,957
Thanks.

493
00:29:32,957 --> 00:29:34,560
Go, go, go!

494
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,172
Pat, I can't take it anymore.

495
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:39,240
Done!

496
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:43,560
Urgh! My stomach!

497
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,161
Here is the last question.

498
00:29:45,161 --> 00:29:46,881
Now you're a bit tipsy, right?

499
00:29:46,881 --> 00:29:48,080
This is the last one, guys.

500
00:29:49,595 --> 00:29:50,694
The question is,

501
00:29:51,382 --> 00:29:55,440
"Who was the chef,
who made the signature menus today?"

502
00:29:56,301 --> 00:29:57,729
Ah! Here it is!

503
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:00,088
Jeng was the chef today!

504
00:30:00,387 --> 00:30:01,680
Yeah! Right!

505
00:30:02,781 --> 00:30:03,752
Yeah, so what's his name?

506
00:30:03,752 --> 00:30:05,019
But Mr. Jeng is my boss.

507
00:30:05,348 --> 00:30:08,206
Yeah. He was the chef, wasn't he?

508
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:09,378
Right.

509
00:30:09,378 --> 00:30:11,493
Mr. Jeng's name is... Mr. Jeng's name is...

510
00:30:11,493 --> 00:30:12,481
What's his name?

511
00:30:12,481 --> 00:30:12,981
His name...?

512
00:30:12,981 --> 00:30:14,440
Urgh! My 15,000 baht, Pat!

513
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,283
What's his name, Pat?

514
00:30:15,283 --> 00:30:15,783
Think!

515
00:30:15,783 --> 00:30:17,370
I can't remember!

516
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,441
You took a photo with him.

517
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,246
So don't you say you can't remember it.

518
00:30:20,246 --> 00:30:21,040
Think carefully.

519
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,540
Kit...

520
00:30:22,076 --> 00:30:23,120
So what's next?

521
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,045
Kittiphat.

522
00:30:24,045 --> 00:30:25,951
Urgh! My 15,000 baht!

523
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:27,481
"Kit..." and what?

524
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:30,427
Pat!

525
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:32,200
I can't remember!

526
00:30:33,784 --> 00:30:37,214
I'm Jeng, the restaurant's chef.
My name is Kittiphong.

527
00:30:41,449 --> 00:30:42,880
Oooh! Kittiphong!

528
00:30:44,281 --> 00:30:46,840
Technically, correct.

529
00:30:47,154 --> 00:30:50,926
But you're not supposed to answer the question.

530
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,360
It's a foul.

531
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,703
So the other will get the prize!

532
00:30:58,409 --> 00:30:59,151
Congratulations!

533
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:01,433
Eh?
We didn't get 15,000 baht, right?

534
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,238
How did you do that?

535
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:07,681
How about... my 15,000 baht?!

536
00:31:07,681 --> 00:31:09,287
Hey, Pat.

537
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:10,458
Pat!

538
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:12,441
I gave the answer, too!

539
00:31:20,001 --> 00:31:21,086
Jaab, are you going home?

540
00:31:24,072 --> 00:31:24,871
What are you watching?

541
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:28,956
Let me watch it, too.

542
00:31:30,001 --> 00:31:30,571
No!

543
00:31:32,113 --> 00:31:33,598
Could you please stop putting on airs for one day?

544
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,716
Let me watch it, too!

545
00:31:37,482 --> 00:31:38,840
Give it to me!

546
00:31:39,582 --> 00:31:40,381
Jaab...

547
00:31:40,795 --> 00:31:41,766
Or you'll drive me crazy, Jaab.

548
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,984
Jaab!

549
00:31:44,984 --> 00:31:46,180
Let me see!

550
00:31:47,121 --> 00:31:48,492
Let me see!

551
00:31:48,492 --> 00:31:49,281
Hey...

552
00:31:49,281 --> 00:31:50,381
Don't break it!

553
00:31:51,602 --> 00:31:52,458
Take it.

554
00:31:56,741 --> 00:31:58,226
Awww, these are photos of me!

555
00:31:59,295 --> 00:32:00,000
Did you...

556
00:32:01,927 --> 00:32:03,241
secretly take them all?

557
00:32:04,343 --> 00:32:05,057
No...

558
00:32:06,201 --> 00:32:07,240
I didn't.

559
00:32:11,411 --> 00:32:14,841
The photos of Kanun and Ae at the backdrop are so cute.

560
00:32:14,841 --> 00:32:16,042
They look like pre-wedding photos.

561
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:19,160
How cute!

562
00:32:25,629 --> 00:32:29,001
So do you want a wedding ceremony with Mon?

563
00:32:30,646 --> 00:32:31,903
Of course.

564
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,094
But it must take so long, I think.

565
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,222
And...

566
00:32:52,087 --> 00:32:57,632
Do you believe in chemistry, Jen?

567
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:01,143
Chemistry?

568
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:02,174
It's like...

569
00:33:03,434 --> 00:33:04,748
Kanun and Ae, right?

570
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:06,309
Yeah.

571
00:33:07,721 --> 00:33:08,978
I don't know.

572
00:33:08,978 --> 00:33:11,876
Ah, do you know about chemistry between two characters,

573
00:33:12,292 --> 00:33:14,521
in a film course at university?

574
00:33:16,116 --> 00:33:21,146
Yeah, but I admit I didn't really get it.

575
00:33:21,146 --> 00:33:22,837
So I couldn't really be bothered.

576
00:33:23,863 --> 00:33:24,948
Why?

577
00:33:26,868 --> 00:33:28,010
Or...

578
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:31,721
Do you believe in chemistry, Jaab?

579
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:35,374
I don't know.

580
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:42,847
But because of you, I believe it's true.

581
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:53,964
Mon and you.

582
00:33:55,089 --> 00:33:57,089
I see.

583
00:33:58,835 --> 00:34:00,000
Are you done watching them?

584
00:34:01,524 --> 00:34:03,009
Give it to me now.

585
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:08,496
What?

586
00:34:09,365 --> 00:34:11,251
Wait, are you erratic or something?

587
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:13,311
You're crazy!

588
00:34:18,327 --> 00:34:20,000
Do you want me to drop you at your condo?

589
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:22,396
No, thanks.

590
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:25,407
I just talked with Mon on the phone.

591
00:34:26,401 --> 00:34:30,960
He told me to wait for him at your condo,

592
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,481
and that he would pick me up there.

593
00:34:34,626 --> 00:34:35,482
Can I?

594
00:34:36,285 --> 00:34:37,370
Of course.

595
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,000
What are you doing?

596
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,554
I'm texting Jeng about this.

597
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:58,110
So excited!

598
00:34:58,853 --> 00:35:01,196
It feels like hooking up with at a guy for the first time.

599
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:11,085
So let's go now.

600
00:35:11,085 --> 00:35:11,895
Wait, wait, wait.

601
00:35:13,061 --> 00:35:14,546
Stop! Stop! Stop!

602
00:35:15,052 --> 00:35:15,851
Stop!

603
00:35:16,812 --> 00:35:18,720
Hands down! Hands down!

604
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,791
I don't need your help.

605
00:35:20,524 --> 00:35:21,209
Ok!

606
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:26,927
Wait, Mr. Jen.

607
00:35:27,986 --> 00:35:29,986
Let me open the door for you.

608
00:35:50,341 --> 00:35:52,341
Next time you don't need to do that for me.

609
00:35:53,009 --> 00:35:54,666
Good service, isn't it?

610
00:35:59,608 --> 00:36:02,523
Wow! What a view!

611
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,384
I'm so envious!

612
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:07,760
Would you like some drink?

613
00:36:08,189 --> 00:36:09,388
Drinking water?

614
00:36:10,243 --> 00:36:11,328
I have beer, too.

615
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,311
Or would you like green tea?

616
00:36:14,924 --> 00:36:16,066
Green tea, please.

617
00:36:16,561 --> 00:36:17,061
Ok.

618
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:35,801
Here you go.

619
00:36:38,413 --> 00:36:39,555
Thanks.

620
00:36:42,313 --> 00:36:43,284
Hey,

621
00:36:43,677 --> 00:36:45,277
sugar-free?

622
00:36:47,315 --> 00:36:48,171
Yeah.

623
00:36:49,272 --> 00:36:50,700
It tastes good,

624
00:36:51,396 --> 00:36:52,767
and doesn't make you fat, too.

625
00:36:54,602 --> 00:36:55,458
Hey!

626
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:57,953
Are you calling me fat?

627
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,550
No, I'm not.

628
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,753
Just in case you don't want to gain weight.

629
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:06,424
Or are you getting paranoid?

630
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:08,568
No, I'm not.

631
00:37:12,161 --> 00:37:13,875
Don't be upset.

632
00:37:14,939 --> 00:37:16,825
There, there.

633
00:37:16,825 --> 00:37:18,506
Don't be upset.

634
00:37:23,012 --> 00:37:25,184
Drink it, so you'll stop being upset with me.

635
00:37:25,692 --> 00:37:26,720
Please.

636
00:37:27,092 --> 00:37:29,640
It's good, right? I never lie to you.

637
00:37:30,451 --> 00:37:31,720
Okay, I'll drink it.

638
00:37:38,483 --> 00:37:40,483
Wow! How refreshing!

639
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:43,343
It's not too sweet as well.

640
00:37:43,343 --> 00:37:45,377
It feels just like a commercial casting.

641
00:37:47,615 --> 00:37:48,872
What?

642
00:37:49,716 --> 00:37:53,317
4..3..2..1..

643
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:54,543
Action!

644
00:37:58,861 --> 00:38:00,689
Umm...How was it?

645
00:38:02,757 --> 00:38:04,800
You look kinda cute.

646
00:38:06,144 --> 00:38:07,115
You're crazy.

647
00:38:51,972 --> 00:38:53,343
Well...

648
00:38:55,101 --> 00:38:56,320
I...

649
00:39:23,316 --> 00:39:25,316
I like...

650
00:39:35,835 --> 00:39:37,206
Hello, Mon.

651
00:39:39,747 --> 00:39:41,118
Have you arrived?

652
00:39:44,241 --> 00:39:45,784
What's going on?

653
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,443
Ok. Ok.

654
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,522
Jaab.

655
00:39:52,522 --> 00:39:53,022
Huh?

656
00:39:54,983 --> 00:39:56,297
Well...

657
00:40:22,497 --> 00:40:26,155
Jaab, thank you so much.
I had a stomach ache.

658
00:40:26,502 --> 00:40:27,873
Without you, it would've been so bad.

659
00:40:28,842 --> 00:40:30,900
That's fine. You're welcome.

660
00:40:31,659 --> 00:40:32,515
You're welcome.

661
00:40:33,319 --> 00:40:35,262
So thank you so much for today, Jaab.

662
00:40:35,262 --> 00:40:36,260
It was real fun.

663
00:40:38,632 --> 00:40:40,804
Let's go, Jen. It's late now.

664
00:40:41,036 --> 00:40:42,579
So, good bye.

665
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:43,664
See ya.

666
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:44,626
See ya.

667
00:40:44,812 --> 00:40:45,497
See ya.

668
00:40:53,177 --> 00:40:54,662
Your hair is messy.

669
00:40:57,724 --> 00:40:58,580
What?

670
00:40:58,845 --> 00:41:00,000
It's the same.

671
00:41:00,476 --> 00:41:01,275
Let's go.

672
00:41:22,209 --> 00:41:27,697
(Jeng: Jaab, today I'm not getting back to the condo.)

673
00:42:33,661 --> 00:42:34,800
Where on earth is this?

674
00:42:56,521 --> 00:42:57,600
Do I go first?

675
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:00,000
15,000 baht.

676
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,605
Don't give up.

677
00:43:01,801 --> 00:43:03,240
Urgh! I can't remember!

678
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,361
You're so mean, Mr. Jeng!

679
00:43:05,361 --> 00:43:08,315
You're so bad! I was not wrong!

680
00:43:08,315 --> 00:43:10,121
I will never resign!

681
00:43:10,121 --> 00:43:11,321
Because I was not wrong!

682
00:43:29,864 --> 00:43:31,521
Ooh! I must run! I must run!

683
00:43:49,674 --> 00:43:50,840
Because I was not wrong!

684
00:43:51,169 --> 00:43:53,512
Pat, get in my car. I'll drive you home.

685
00:43:54,361 --> 00:43:55,904
Be careful. Mind your head.

686
00:44:01,938 --> 00:44:03,423
Go to my condo, Somjit.

687
00:44:05,161 --> 00:44:08,648
I was not wrong! I will never resign!

688
00:44:15,406 --> 00:44:20,621
(Jab: I'm getting back with Jen.)

689
00:44:24,644 --> 00:44:26,644
Drive us to my home, then.

690
00:46:07,004 --> 00:46:08,389
How was your sleep?

691
00:46:10,287 --> 00:46:11,120
Good.

692
00:46:14,601 --> 00:46:15,515
Well...

693
00:46:16,244 --> 00:46:18,244
can you pass me my phone and bag?

694
00:46:18,872 --> 00:46:21,120
Yes. I'm gonna get them for you.

695
00:46:21,782 --> 00:46:24,926
By the way,
would you like some congee with me before you go?

696
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:26,959
I've had the maid make it.

697
00:46:27,565 --> 00:46:31,395
I'm not hungry, so I think I'd better go.

698
00:46:32,575 --> 00:46:33,546
Ok.

699
00:46:34,609 --> 00:46:38,553
So I'll give your clothes back to you.

700
00:46:39,068 --> 00:46:40,655
I've had the maid wash them.

701
00:46:48,327 --> 00:46:50,880
Don't worry.
She was the one who redressed you.

702
00:46:52,902 --> 00:46:54,273
Well, Mr. Jeng.

703
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,929
I'm sorry for last night.

704
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,697
Didn't I do something weird?

705
00:47:01,732 --> 00:47:02,600
No, you didn't.

706
00:47:03,392 --> 00:47:04,306
Really?

707
00:47:04,641 --> 00:47:09,840
You were just drunk and sleep cursing me all the way home.

708
00:47:10,233 --> 00:47:14,360
You hit me. You slapped me.
And I had to carry you into my car and my house.

709
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,503
Not to mention when the car was parked in front.

710
00:47:16,503 --> 00:47:19,241
You just plunged down and threw up right there.

711
00:47:19,241 --> 00:47:21,521
Mr. Jeng, I wanna throw up!

712
00:47:21,521 --> 00:47:22,841
Go, go.

713
00:47:29,586 --> 00:47:31,872
Just a bit! Just a bit!

714
00:47:34,267 --> 00:47:35,840
So I'll bring you your phone.

715
00:47:46,921 --> 00:47:47,720
Here it is.

716
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:49,164
Yes.

717
00:47:49,164 --> 00:47:50,281
You clothes are in here.

718
00:47:50,786 --> 00:47:51,528
Thank you.

719
00:47:52,753 --> 00:47:55,880
You can join the ride with me when leaving.
I'm going to the restaurant.

720
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,651
No, thanks.

721
00:48:05,704 --> 00:48:10,280
Whao! Your house is quite far away from mine.

722
00:48:19,624 --> 00:48:21,960
Mr. Jeng, do you pass a skytrain station?

723
00:48:22,155 --> 00:48:24,080
Yes, I do. No worries.

724
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,232
Let's go.

725
00:48:25,232 --> 00:48:26,117
Yeah.

726
00:48:34,895 --> 00:48:35,694
Hey,

727
00:48:36,666 --> 00:48:38,666
are you going outside?

728
00:48:39,715 --> 00:48:43,680
Yeah. Will you have dinner with us?
It won't take so long before we come back.

729
00:48:44,065 --> 00:48:47,266
I don't think so, Mom. I need to oversee the restaurant.

730
00:48:51,211 --> 00:48:53,840
Well, this is Pat, my team member.

731
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,640
I asked him for a work discussion here.

732
00:48:59,253 --> 00:49:00,400
Hello.

733
00:49:15,013 --> 00:49:18,440
His clothes were stained, so I borrowed him mine.

734
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,920
Take care of him, son.

735
00:49:30,028 --> 00:49:31,040
Make yourself at home.

736
00:49:31,684 --> 00:49:32,883
Yeah.

737
00:49:47,364 --> 00:49:48,163
Let's go, then.

738
00:49:48,899 --> 00:49:49,399
Yeah.

739
00:50:20,697 --> 00:50:24,184
(Pat: Did you just ditch me last night, Ae?!
How come did I wake up at Mr. Jeng's house?)

740
00:50:27,278 --> 00:50:30,250
(AE: Really?! So have you left his place?)

741
00:50:31,322 --> 00:50:34,065
(Pat: He already read my assessment!!!)

742
00:50:34,065 --> 00:50:35,598
(Ae: OMG! So where are you now?!)

743
00:50:37,115 --> 00:50:40,000
(Pat: In his car to a skytrain station.)

744
00:50:40,918 --> 00:50:43,204
(Ae:What? Why didn't you call Uber or something?)

745
00:50:43,705 --> 00:50:47,363
(Ae: You just fake a sleep.
Don't make him mention the assessment.)

746
00:50:50,761 --> 00:50:52,532
How is your Forge project going?

747
00:50:53,149 --> 00:50:53,649
Yes.

748
00:50:54,205 --> 00:51:00,551
I noticed that Pat has been working for 3 months,
but the work is moving very slowly.

749
00:51:00,907 --> 00:51:03,760
Well, do you want me to provide more helpers?

750
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:08,455
If you're not interested with this,
you can switch to other projects.

751
00:51:08,455 --> 00:51:09,175
No, I am,

752
00:51:09,453 --> 00:51:11,080
I really enjoy working for Forge.

753
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:13,670
Yes.

754
00:51:24,236 --> 00:51:29,438
(Pat: Ae! Mr. Jeng is finding someone to replace me.
Or is he firing me!?)

755
00:51:29,438 --> 00:51:32,597
(Ae: Hey! Don't answer him!
Can you jump out of his car now?!)

756
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:44,812
Pat.

757
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:05,321
(Pat: What do I do, Ae?!)

758
00:52:25,374 --> 00:52:28,918
(No! You're so angry you're gonna punch me?!)

759
00:52:28,918 --> 00:52:30,001
(No!)

760
00:52:30,001 --> 00:52:33,336
Well, I'm sorry. Did I wake you up?

761
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:37,862
Did I fall asleep?

762
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:40,000
It was probably a hangover.

763
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,240
There was a mosquito on your face, so I was about to catch it.

764
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:52,974
Well, could you pass me a wiper in the box over there?

765
00:52:53,674 --> 00:52:54,816
Here you go.

766
00:53:21,983 --> 00:53:22,725
Thank you.

767
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,225
Thank you.

768
00:53:35,354 --> 00:53:38,498
Well, you want me to drop you at this station, right?

769
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,502
Yes, please.

770
00:53:40,953 --> 00:53:44,268
Somjit, pull over at the station over there.

771
00:53:55,116 --> 00:53:56,720
Thank you, Mr. Jeng. See you next Monday.

772
00:53:57,269 --> 00:53:58,011
See you.

773
00:54:24,441 --> 00:54:27,242
Today it's gonna be very chilling.
Mr. Jeng isn't at the office.

774
00:54:27,536 --> 00:54:28,449
Really?!

775
00:54:28,449 --> 00:54:28,949
Yeah.

776
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,028
Great!

777
00:54:31,482 --> 00:54:34,854
Whenever he's here, I always feel so messed up.

778
00:54:35,228 --> 00:54:36,885
And when he's overseeing the kitchen,

779
00:54:37,117 --> 00:54:38,660
I feel like I'm being nitpicked!

780
00:54:39,522 --> 00:54:40,264
Why?

781
00:54:40,816 --> 00:54:42,359
But you are just better than before!

782
00:54:43,491 --> 00:54:44,919
But isn't it stressful?

783
00:54:44,919 --> 00:54:49,432
How I wish I could only see a guy like him at the office!

784
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,950
It's true. Our duty is just to work, isn't it?

785
00:54:53,407 --> 00:54:55,121
Yeah. The restaurant's back, too.

786
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:56,632
What are you doing?

787
00:54:56,632 --> 00:54:57,379
Working.

788
00:54:57,792 --> 00:54:58,292
Yes.

789
00:55:21,754 --> 00:55:22,668
What' wrong with you?

790
00:55:23,411 --> 00:55:24,553
What's the point of overthinking?

791
00:55:32,381 --> 00:55:33,180
Sigh!

792
00:55:35,606 --> 00:55:39,600
You know that it's normal for a boss to be gossip.

793
00:55:40,322 --> 00:55:43,080
And the subordinates are so hard to please these days.

794
00:55:43,763 --> 00:55:46,520
When you treat them too kindly, they will not listen to you.

795
00:55:47,153 --> 00:55:49,724
When you're mean to them,
they'll just slack off for revenge.

796
00:55:49,724 --> 00:55:52,244
Human management is difficult.
You know it.

797
00:55:54,987 --> 00:55:56,987
By the way, what are you doing here?
It's a weekend, isn't it?

798
00:55:59,667 --> 00:56:00,695
I changed my mind.

799
00:56:03,021 --> 00:56:05,536
At first I thought I needed to take care of a sick guy.

800
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:10,000
But he could get home,
so I decided to come and work here.

801
00:56:10,722 --> 00:56:12,560
When I'm alone, I'll be lost in thoughts.

802
00:56:13,735 --> 00:56:15,506
Why are you thinking so much?

803
00:56:21,457 --> 00:56:25,001
I think you should go home and unwind.

804
00:56:25,001 --> 00:56:27,041
Clear up everything from your mind.

805
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:32,827
And you know that,
I had to clean up every mess you made yesterday?

806
00:56:35,154 --> 00:56:36,525
Yesday?

807
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:39,520
What mess did I make, Tae?

808
00:56:40,001 --> 00:56:42,687
Well, you were supposed to take care of the kitchen,
weren't you?

809
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:48,355
But you were so nervous about the party outside
that the kitchen system was all messed up.

810
00:56:48,355 --> 00:56:50,801
And the food was served very slowly.

811
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:54,880
Do you realize that you're acting very strange?

812
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:08,341
So let Ae post them on the restaurant's page now.

813
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:08,841
Ok.

814
00:57:08,841 --> 00:57:10,001
Hey, I wanna pee.

815
00:57:12,663 --> 00:57:13,691
Nobody wants to eat this?

816
00:57:14,663 --> 00:57:15,655
But it looks so good.

817
00:57:15,655 --> 00:57:17,835
There you go. I'm all stuffed.

818
00:57:19,462 --> 00:57:20,000
Hey, bro.

819
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,485
Come here.

820
00:57:25,872 --> 00:57:26,957
That's Pat, isn't he?

821
00:57:27,991 --> 00:57:29,305
What's he doing here?

822
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:32,001
Tae invited him here.

823
00:57:33,185 --> 00:57:35,871
He's like a VIP of this restaurant.

824
00:57:38,217 --> 00:57:40,760
I'm gonna go pee.

825
00:57:41,005 --> 00:57:42,433
Yeah. Go, go, go.

826
00:57:46,404 --> 00:57:47,375
Do you want join in?

827
00:57:56,641 --> 00:57:58,241
You probably don't realize.

828
00:58:02,156 --> 00:58:03,756
Is there something else I don't know?

829
00:58:07,476 --> 00:58:09,305
As my partner,

830
00:58:10,636 --> 00:58:17,611
you make feel very at ease working with you
and believing that it must be perfect.

831
00:58:18,721 --> 00:58:21,807
But it's good that we're just friends.

832
00:58:23,012 --> 00:58:26,899
If you were meant to be my boss,

833
00:58:27,703 --> 00:58:28,731
I would just say no.

834
00:58:29,117 --> 00:58:30,000
Just say no.

835
00:59:03,441 --> 00:59:05,441
Ouch! Ouch!

836
00:59:05,844 --> 00:59:08,473
Ouch! Ouch!

837
00:59:08,473 --> 00:59:10,001
What a stomachache!

838
00:59:10,001 --> 00:59:11,164
What have you done?

839
00:59:11,164 --> 00:59:13,229
It must be your food yesterday.

840
00:59:13,964 --> 00:59:15,335
I'm dying!

841
00:59:16,962 --> 00:59:18,562
You're exaggerating, Jaab!

842
00:59:18,843 --> 00:59:21,129
Pat didn't even have any symptoms.

843
00:59:26,249 --> 00:59:28,249
Why are you talking about him now?

844
00:59:30,001 --> 00:59:37,319
Well, after the party,
I carried him and sent him to my place when he was that drunk

845
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I still remember how shocked he was,

846
00:59:43,361 --> 00:59:44,789
when he saw you at the restaurant.

847
00:59:45,086 --> 00:59:46,343
It was as if he had been seeing a ghost!

848
00:59:47,499 --> 00:59:49,499
He must be really afraid of you.

849
00:59:53,521 --> 00:59:55,921
Ouch! What a stomachache!

850
00:59:56,774 --> 00:59:59,120
I can't take it anymore! It's coming back!

851
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,732
But it's good that we're just friends.

852
01:00:52,536 --> 01:00:56,423
If you were meant to be my boss,

853
01:00:57,284 --> 01:00:58,440
I would just say no.

854
01:01:18,316 --> 01:01:21,117
I still remember how shocked he was,

855
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:22,840
when he saw you at the restaurant.

856
01:01:23,253 --> 01:01:24,510
It was as if he had been seeing a ghost!

857
01:01:25,834 --> 01:01:27,605
He must be really afraid of you.

858
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:28,894
He must be really afraid of you.

859
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:30,935
Mr. Jeng, you're my hero!

860
01:01:31,393 --> 01:01:32,707
You're handsome,

861
01:01:33,991 --> 01:01:34,720
and smart.

862
01:01:35,634 --> 01:01:37,806
You're so different from how other people see you.

863
01:01:41,131 --> 01:01:42,959
I thought you would hate me.

864
01:01:47,918 --> 01:01:50,000
No, I don't.

865
01:01:51,527 --> 01:01:53,527
I'm just confused.

866
01:01:58,148 --> 01:02:02,149
Because Mr. Jeng whose shoe I spilled the glass jelly on

867
01:02:02,149 --> 01:02:03,859
and Mr. Jeng who is my boss,

868
01:02:05,687 --> 01:02:07,230
are so different.

869
01:02:08,761 --> 01:02:15,393
So I don't know which one is the real you.

870
01:02:24,312 --> 01:02:33,840
What if we knew each other as someone else,
not a boss and a subordinate?

871
01:03:06,886 --> 01:03:09,115
Do you know what I was through?!

872
01:03:10,262 --> 01:03:12,262
How did you ditch me alone at the restaurant like that?!

873
01:03:12,471 --> 01:03:17,800
(Ae: I'm sorry. But didn't Mr.
Jeng tell you that he would take you home himself?)

874
01:03:24,263 --> 01:03:28,036
How did you do that? How about my 15,000 baht?!

875
01:03:28,036 --> 01:03:29,436
My 15,000 baht?!

876
01:03:29,725 --> 01:03:31,240
My 15,000 baht?!

877
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,960
Pat, you can't lie down here!

878
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:33,874
Urgh! Ae!

879
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,740
Both of you!

880
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:37,009
What a pain in my butt!

881
01:03:37,009 --> 01:03:38,761
So let me take care of Pat.

882
01:03:38,990 --> 01:03:41,960
Ooh! So handsome? Who are you?

883
01:03:42,261 --> 01:03:44,433
Don't worry. I'm Pat's boss.

884
01:03:44,836 --> 01:03:45,920
Pat's boss?!

885
01:03:46,206 --> 01:03:46,706
Yes.

886
01:03:47,474 --> 01:03:48,440
Pat's boss?!

887
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:49,470
That Jeng guy?!

888
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:49,970
Ae!

889
01:03:49,970 --> 01:03:51,051
The very boss...

890
01:03:51,893 --> 01:03:53,080
I got your name right.

891
01:03:53,385 --> 01:03:54,870
How about my 15,000 baht, Mr. Jeng?

892
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:56,081
Quiet Ae!!

893
01:03:56,081 --> 01:03:58,281
Apologise for my friend.

894
01:03:59,096 --> 01:04:00,000
Kittipoj.

895
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,750
Mr. Jeng, please take care of Pat.

896
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:02,250
Ok.

897
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:03,161
Kittisong.

898
01:04:03,161 --> 01:04:05,248
Stand up.Hold me.

899
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,338
Shut up!

900
01:04:06,338 --> 01:04:07,346
Ok. Ok.

901
01:04:07,346 --> 01:04:08,680
I know you're saying.

902
01:04:10,714 --> 01:04:11,628
Kanun!

903
01:04:11,628 --> 01:04:12,507
How about Beam?

904
01:04:12,793 --> 01:04:16,051
He's in the toilet.
Don't worry about him. Worry about yourself.

905
01:04:16,051 --> 01:04:16,840
Ok.
Ok.

906
01:04:18,798 --> 01:04:19,712
Jeng!

907
01:04:19,712 --> 01:04:20,408
Mr. Mr.

908
01:04:20,408 --> 01:04:23,731
Well, Mr. Jeng. Please take care of Pat.

909
01:04:24,532 --> 01:04:26,246
Ok. You can count on me.

910
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:28,005
Ok.

911
01:04:29,473 --> 01:04:30,387
Go, then.

912
01:04:30,387 --> 01:04:33,565
Urgh! Don't hiccup while speaking!

913
01:04:33,565 --> 01:04:34,513
Let's go, Pat.

914
01:04:34,513 --> 01:04:35,013
Man, I wanna puke!

915
01:04:35,013 --> 01:04:35,774
Walk slowly.

916
01:04:36,174 --> 01:04:36,881
You wanna puke again?

917
01:04:36,881 --> 01:04:37,381
Yeah!

918
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,742
Choose one! Puke, speak, or hiccup!

919
01:04:41,267 --> 01:04:43,095
He's fooling you, Ae.

920
01:04:44,709 --> 01:04:46,200
It's just like he did to me at first,

921
01:04:46,541 --> 01:04:48,541
when I didn't know he was my boss.

922
01:04:49,041 --> 01:04:51,771
(Ae: So what kind of a person is he exactly?)

923
01:04:51,771 --> 01:04:52,829
I don't know either.

924
01:04:54,177 --> 01:04:56,806
But I don't think I have a chance to know it.

925
01:04:57,377 --> 01:04:58,938
(Ae: What do you mean?)

926
01:04:58,938 --> 01:05:01,736
All right! Let's talk about it later.

927
01:05:02,638 --> 01:05:04,295
I'll keep you posted, ok?

928
01:05:38,008 --> 01:05:39,265
Have you thought things through, Pat?

929
01:05:43,598 --> 01:05:46,627
It's better to resign than being fired, isn't it?

930
01:05:47,603 --> 01:05:52,634
But I don't even know what reason
to write down on the resignation form.

931
01:05:52,961 --> 01:05:56,391
So why don't you talk with Mr. Jeng first?

932
01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:00,400
I think he's actually quite reasonable.

933
01:06:01,943 --> 01:06:06,173
But what if he'd read my assessment,
and avoided me at all costs?

934
01:06:06,577 --> 01:06:08,120
What would it mean, Nan?

935
01:06:08,628 --> 01:06:15,660
Well, it'd be possible that he'd be playing a mind game with you.

936
01:06:16,733 --> 01:06:21,992
To be honest, there are some bosses
who wouldn't fire you directly.

937
01:06:21,992 --> 01:06:29,334
But... they would make you feel so bad,
you decide to resign on your own.

938
01:06:29,334 --> 01:06:33,278
Mostly, they would start off by saying nice words to you,
like they really cared.

939
01:06:33,278 --> 01:06:36,309
But actually, they would treat you badly.

940
01:06:36,767 --> 01:06:40,720
They would not have you work.
They would demote you.

941
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,738
They would pick on you all the way around.

942
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:48,139
Finally, they would find an excuse to fire you,
and things like that.

943
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:53,720
What? Did he do that?

944
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:55,367
Possibly not.

945
01:06:56,698 --> 01:06:57,440
I'm sorry, then.

946
01:07:00,001 --> 01:07:01,200
Pat,

947
01:07:01,747 --> 01:07:03,404
Mr. Jeng is calling for you.

948
01:07:10,521 --> 01:07:12,521
Let's go first, maybe nothing.

949
01:07:13,277 --> 01:07:14,248
Hurry up.

950
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:20,000
I have read your assessment.

951
01:07:20,665 --> 01:07:23,751
And I think we can find the solutions together.

952
01:07:30,001 --> 01:07:31,360
Does it sound too serious?

953
01:07:34,344 --> 01:07:35,829
I have read your assessment.

954
01:07:35,829 --> 01:07:38,321
And I really want to help you.

955
01:07:43,744 --> 01:07:45,480
So does it look too complaint?

956
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:49,640
I have read your assessment.

957
01:07:50,277 --> 01:07:51,705
I have read your assessment.

958
01:07:51,705 --> 01:07:56,203
And I think... I think we can find the solutions together.

959
01:08:07,386 --> 01:08:08,104
Welcome.

960
01:08:14,933 --> 01:08:16,933
Are you calling for me?

961
01:08:18,645 --> 01:08:19,673
Sit down.

962
01:08:28,165 --> 01:08:28,680
Well...

963
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:32,199
If you call for me to fire me,
I think I'd better resign myself.

964
01:08:32,884 --> 01:08:34,884
These are your clothes. I washed them.

965
01:08:36,907 --> 01:08:37,840
What's it all about?

966
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:40,320
I know that you're dissatisfied with my assessment,
so I'll resign.

967
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:41,388
No, I'm not.

968
01:08:41,388 --> 01:08:44,599
I'm calling for you to ask about something else.

969
01:08:44,942 --> 01:08:49,515
I intend to consult you about the one-on-one session
with each employee next week.

970
01:08:50,131 --> 01:08:52,960
I intend to solve the problems in our company.

971
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:58,120
One of them is the accusation
of many employees' misbehaviors.

972
01:08:58,409 --> 01:09:01,440
And I know it includes yours, right?

973
01:09:04,497 --> 01:09:08,040
I have read the assessment, and I'm not happy either.

974
01:09:08,387 --> 01:09:14,000
By talking about this, I don't mean to make you feel bad,

975
01:09:14,393 --> 01:09:17,079
but I want to hear it from you, too.

976
01:09:17,361 --> 01:09:19,361
Therefore, I will proceed this issue.

977
01:09:20,825 --> 01:09:24,483
Don't worry about the confidentiality.
What they say will remain in this room.

978
01:09:25,278 --> 01:09:28,547
I admit that I had never learned about this before,

979
01:09:28,547 --> 01:09:31,121
until I got to ready the assessments from many employees.

980
01:09:31,577 --> 01:09:34,378
And I will never let this happen in my department.

981
01:09:36,611 --> 01:09:38,381
I have prepared some punishment for Prem.

982
01:09:38,381 --> 01:09:39,644
And you, Pat,

983
01:09:42,081 --> 01:09:45,360
I may warn you of controlling your emotions.

984
01:09:47,172 --> 01:09:48,200
Is it fair?

985
01:09:52,092 --> 01:09:54,950
I intend to improve myself.

986
01:09:55,989 --> 01:09:58,389
I want to become a better boss,

987
01:09:58,389 --> 01:10:01,476
so I can work with you in the long run.

988
01:10:01,944 --> 01:10:07,200
And I hope that someday you will see the real me better.

989
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:16,994
Welcome.

990
01:10:25,723 --> 01:10:27,151
Are you calling for me, Mr. Jeng?

991
01:10:27,783 --> 01:10:30,698
Prem, I'm calling for you to hear an accusation,

992
01:10:31,329 --> 01:10:34,816
about many of your misbehaviors.

993
01:10:35,905 --> 01:10:37,480
Do you have any excuse?

994
01:10:39,001 --> 01:10:42,520
Well, I was just joking.

995
01:10:43,177 --> 01:10:44,434
Joking is also unacceptable.

996
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:46,680
I don't think the listeners are happy with you.

997
01:10:48,669 --> 01:10:49,239
Yes.

998
01:10:52,201 --> 01:10:55,880
I've talked over this with Pat,
and he's agreed to compromise.

999
01:10:56,492 --> 01:10:59,464
But fundamentally,
I will punish you by transferring you to another team,

1000
01:10:59,464 --> 01:11:01,178
cutting your days off, and cutting down your bonus.

1001
01:11:01,696 --> 01:11:05,240
Your punishment will be suspended
during the monitoring session.

1002
01:11:05,815 --> 01:11:09,200
If you make the same mistake again,
you will never have a second chance.

1003
01:11:12,907 --> 01:11:13,592
All right.

1004
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:15,770
And finally,

1005
01:11:16,288 --> 01:11:20,232
So don't you say you can't rememer their name!

1006
01:11:21,036 --> 01:11:25,781
And Pat, I want you to apologize to Pream
for your emotional mismanagement.

1007
01:11:30,162 --> 01:11:31,018
Pat,

1008
01:11:31,843 --> 01:11:33,214
I'm... I'm sorry.

1009
01:11:34,243 --> 01:11:35,280
I'm really sorry.

1010
01:11:37,936 --> 01:11:39,536
I'm sorry, too.

1011
01:11:49,682 --> 01:11:52,540
I intend to improve myself.

1012
01:11:53,121 --> 01:11:56,000
I want to become a better boss,

1013
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,931
so I can work with you in the long run.

1014
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:03,618
And I hope that someday you will see the real me better.

1015
01:12:17,641 --> 01:12:21,720
I found nail polish and shampoo and soap
for a woman in Mr. Jeng's condo.

1016
01:12:22,094 --> 01:12:23,808
He must be hiding a girl.

1017
01:12:23,808 --> 01:12:25,763
Hello, ok.

1018
01:12:25,763 --> 01:12:27,641
We're meeting on Sunday at 1:00 p.m., right?

1019
01:12:27,641 --> 01:12:30,353
But if I know Mr. Jeng's weak points,

1020
01:12:30,353 --> 01:12:33,857
then I can make a bargain when Jeng tries me.

1021
01:12:33,857 --> 01:12:36,520
Well, I've wondered for a while.

1022
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,520
These days Pat seems to be paying special attention to me.

1023
01:12:40,001 --> 01:12:41,544
Or do you like Mr. Jeng?

1024
01:12:43,919 --> 01:12:44,920
Mr. Jeng,

1025
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,436
I'm ready.
