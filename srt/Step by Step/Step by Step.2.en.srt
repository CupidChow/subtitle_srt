1
00:00:00,232 --> 00:00:01,701
(Previously)
Good morning, Pat.

2
00:00:01,702 --> 00:00:03,702
I hope it's going to be your lucky day.

3
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:06,640
Whenever work brings you down too much,

4
00:00:06,641 --> 00:00:08,376
just take a step back.

5
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, let me...

6
00:00:14,267 --> 00:00:16,400
Can I treat you to a cup
of coffee as an apology?

7
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:17,800
I'll have a hot one.

8
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:20,800
I was so freaking mind
blown away by his smile.

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,440
You like him, look at your reaction.

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,800
Mr. Jeng, the new manager is waiting for you.

11
00:00:27,484 --> 00:00:28,999
We meet again.

12
00:01:07,342 --> 00:01:08,282
What happened?

13
00:01:11,526 --> 00:01:12,784
I got into a bit of an accident.

14
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,550
On Monday I'll go talk to
the department's manager.

15
00:01:26,806 --> 00:01:28,806
Do what you want.

16
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:31,171
You've thought this through, right?

17
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,558
Yes.

18
00:01:35,294 --> 00:01:38,460
After all, I was the one who
founded this department.

19
00:01:39,614 --> 00:01:41,614
I want to take full responsibility.

20
00:01:49,022 --> 00:01:51,128
You don't have to take
responsibility for everything.

21
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:58,210
It's normal to lay off employees,
or shut down a department.

22
00:01:58,235 --> 00:02:00,356
Every company does that.

23
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:04,795
We just have to pay employees
the compensation as we see fit.

24
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,053
That's all.

25
00:02:13,577 --> 00:02:15,577
But it's fine by me.

26
00:02:17,653 --> 00:02:20,000
I'll give you another chance
to prove yourself again,

27
00:02:21,005 --> 00:02:24,913
On how this department is
important to my company.

28
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:31,166
OK Dad.

29
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,600
(Step By Step)
(Episode 2)

30
00:03:35,162 --> 00:03:36,208
Don't stop.

31
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,835
Oh my gosh!

32
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:02,152
Aren't you finished yet?

33
00:04:08,093 --> 00:04:08,609
Oh my!

34
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:10,450
Here, let me help you.

35
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:14,965
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:16,931
It's almost done.

37
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,592
I'm so sorry Mr. Jeng.

38
00:04:20,592 --> 00:04:23,122
I thought that Pat
had already finished it.

39
00:04:23,484 --> 00:04:25,484
I didn't think it'd be like this.

40
00:04:33,656 --> 00:04:34,702
Thank you.

41
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,106
Thank you.

42
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,793
Thank you very much.

43
00:04:50,632 --> 00:04:51,307
Ying.

44
00:04:51,727 --> 00:04:52,349
Yes?

45
00:04:52,857 --> 00:04:54,645
Impressive content as usual.

46
00:04:56,082 --> 00:04:58,082
I know that content is the most important part.

47
00:04:58,742 --> 00:05:01,113
However…Slide 13 please.

48
00:05:19,356 --> 00:05:22,522
I prefer a professional-looking
presentation.

49
00:05:23,302 --> 00:05:25,302
Just like how you did it
a couple of times before.

50
00:05:37,627 --> 00:05:38,196
Oh.

51
00:05:38,624 --> 00:05:39,735
Mr. James.. Uh..

52
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,889
Rush, a bit rushed this time.

53
00:05:43,474 --> 00:05:44,467
You know. Um..

54
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:46,308
I... I... I...

55
00:05:46,727 --> 00:05:49,204
Oh... I have my coordinator help,

56
00:05:50,594 --> 00:05:55,562
and he did it like this.

57
00:06:02,182 --> 00:06:04,182
Sorry, am so sorry Mr. James.

58
00:06:04,651 --> 00:06:05,644
Sorry.

59
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:13,287
Yes.

60
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:16,987
I'm her coordinator.

61
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:18,722
My name is Pat.

62
00:06:19,052 --> 00:06:21,052
Thank you very much for your feedback.

63
00:06:22,262 --> 00:06:25,835
I admit that this time I
made a mistake, the slides...

64
00:06:25,835 --> 00:06:27,835
they don't look professional enough.

65
00:06:28,502 --> 00:06:32,357
However, I really appreciate
all your compliments.

66
00:06:32,865 --> 00:06:34,865
Thank you very much, Mr. James.

67
00:06:39,717 --> 00:06:43,519
Because I've always been
the one who cleans them up,

68
00:06:43,848 --> 00:06:47,067
those professional-looking slides
from all the previous meetings.

69
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,799
Pat?

70
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:19,799
How could you do that to Ying?

71
00:07:20,557 --> 00:07:21,603
Pat?

72
00:07:22,516 --> 00:07:23,244
Pat?

73
00:07:24,005 --> 00:07:24,627
Pat?

74
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:26,119
Hey!

75
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:28,565
Are you listening to me?

76
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:34,007
I asked you, how could you do that to Ying?

77
00:07:36,364 --> 00:07:38,523
But she threw me under the bus first.

78
00:07:39,253 --> 00:07:40,564
But aren't you in the wrong?

79
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:43,437
You didn't finish her work in time.

80
00:07:45,717 --> 00:07:48,247
But it's actually not my job?

81
00:07:49,297 --> 00:07:52,145
My job is research and supporting the team.

82
00:07:52,883 --> 00:07:53,452
Pat,

83
00:07:53,824 --> 00:07:56,566
but those slides are our team's work.

84
00:07:57,385 --> 00:07:59,385
Ying already gave you all the information.

85
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:00,676
What did you do?

86
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:02,504
Just translate a few words,

87
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,050
and put them all in order.

88
00:08:05,656 --> 00:08:08,557
It's as simple as that,
it's not difficult, right?

89
00:08:09,174 --> 00:08:10,220
Right?

90
00:08:12,476 --> 00:08:13,310
Am I right?

91
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:20,000
It wasn't hard enough to
bring Ying down like that,

92
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,481
or don't you know how to do it?

93
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,321
I can help you.

94
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:25,943
Huh?

95
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,671
Pat.

96
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:39,628
Mr. Jeng is asking for you.

97
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:10,656
I've already warned Ying.

98
00:09:11,058 --> 00:09:12,263
I told her that,

99
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:15,194
She's the head of this project,

100
00:09:15,535 --> 00:09:18,436
She should be able to take
on the responsibility in this part,

101
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,769
and not make you do it for her.

102
00:09:21,212 --> 00:09:23,212
Mr. Jeng, you understand me? Right?

103
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:24,644
Yes.

104
00:09:25,924 --> 00:09:27,447
As for your role,

105
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,684
which is supporting the team with research
and feedback to the agency.

106
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,586
Yes, but I always have to
do what Ying tells me to do.

107
00:09:36,398 --> 00:09:39,246
Thank you so much for giving her a warning.

108
00:09:42,554 --> 00:09:44,713
Why don't you try saying no?

109
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:55,573
I've tried to say no,

110
00:09:56,787 --> 00:09:59,476
but she forces me to do it anyway,

111
00:10:00,926 --> 00:10:02,290
when I don't do it,

112
00:10:03,461 --> 00:10:05,461
she will say that I'm inconsiderate.

113
00:10:05,843 --> 00:10:07,684
So that's what made you upset?

114
00:10:19,134 --> 00:10:23,177
I understand, that you must have
felt like you were being accused.

115
00:10:24,683 --> 00:10:26,683
What Ying did was wrong,

116
00:10:27,117 --> 00:10:28,958
for putting the blame on you.

117
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,040
I think you should be more calm,

118
00:10:33,903 --> 00:10:38,155
and you should learn how to control
your emotions like mature people do.

119
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,428
You're still young,

120
00:10:41,644 --> 00:10:46,029
so you still don't understand the
image and credibility of the team.

121
00:10:49,705 --> 00:10:51,705
I understand

122
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,148
but...

123
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:55,679
Why can't you control your emotions?

124
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:06,653
Do you understand that our department

125
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:09,419
is a separate division from MARCOM,

126
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:12,744
which means that we have to
use more company resources,

127
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,299
the board expects better results,

128
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,681
but what you showed them today

129
00:11:19,681 --> 00:11:22,264
is how we are not team players.

130
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:25,913
Our work at the moment
is still not outstanding,

131
00:11:26,609 --> 00:11:31,789
and I'm afraid that someday the board will
decide that they don't need this department.

132
00:11:31,996 --> 00:11:35,203
They may reincorporate us into
one MARCOM team as before,

133
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:38,434
and hire an agency from
outside to do this work instead.

134
00:11:51,104 --> 00:11:54,800
Now, do you understand
the impact of you actions?

135
00:12:38,063 --> 00:12:38,950
Pat?

136
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:41,777
Pat? Are you in the toilet?

137
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,958
Mr. Jeng is calling for an urgent meeting.

138
00:13:00,602 --> 00:13:01,913
Come quickly.

139
00:13:03,557 --> 00:13:06,511
I'm in here, I'll be out soon.

140
00:13:06,982 --> 00:13:09,512
OK, come into the meeting quickly.

141
00:13:52,303 --> 00:13:54,303
According to the plan that I set.

142
00:13:54,866 --> 00:13:57,396
We may have to work a little harder lately.

143
00:13:58,373 --> 00:14:02,652
We have to prove the board that
our department is useful,

144
00:14:03,252 --> 00:14:05,517
and we need to be team players.

145
00:14:06,575 --> 00:14:09,052
So things that happened this
morning would never happen again.

146
00:14:11,882 --> 00:14:14,200
As for the reallocation,

147
00:14:14,493 --> 00:14:17,341
Jian Group is bringing in 4 main brands.

148
00:14:18,004 --> 00:14:22,707
I'll have each group be responsible for one brand all year round,

149
00:14:23,131 --> 00:14:25,767
for familiarity and accuracy in work.

150
00:14:26,678 --> 00:14:29,473
I don't want see you working
with a clear action plan again.

151
00:14:33,141 --> 00:14:35,406
These are the names for each team.

152
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:37,324
Mongkol Mahasarn.

153
00:14:37,553 --> 00:14:39,553
Aoey and Garfield.

154
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:41,365
You'll be working together.

155
00:14:42,001 --> 00:14:42,888
Joynie.

156
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,458
Will be Arm and Program.

157
00:14:46,368 --> 00:14:48,262
Tee and Boss.

158
00:14:48,451 --> 00:14:50,451
You'll be working together.

159
00:14:50,452 --> 00:14:51,551
As for Ying,

160
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,392
You'll be working with Prem.

161
00:14:56,457 --> 00:14:57,715
With Ying?

162
00:15:03,984 --> 00:15:05,295
Are you OK with this?

163
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:07,560
It's fine.

164
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:10,732
Excuse me, Mr. Jeng?

165
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:11,514
I'm sorry.

166
00:15:11,987 --> 00:15:13,669
I have one question.

167
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:14,955
Yes?

168
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:18,873
Um, our company's new product.

169
00:15:19,138 --> 00:15:22,569
Lively+, aren't we going to work on that?

170
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,650
As for Lively+, I'll be
over seeing it myself.

171
00:15:28,249 --> 00:15:29,454
Oh, OK.

172
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:34,986
As for Pat.

173
00:15:35,806 --> 00:15:38,601
Please come and see me after the meeting.

174
00:15:55,297 --> 00:16:00,477
Before this you advised me about ordering
products beforehand on the company's page.

175
00:16:01,153 --> 00:16:03,577
It's a great way to solve
our clients pain point.

176
00:16:04,014 --> 00:16:08,187
It's easy and affordable
but many people overlook it.

177
00:16:08,977 --> 00:16:12,779
I think you have potential,

178
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:15,749
so I want to give you a
chance to prove yourself.

179
00:16:18,601 --> 00:16:19,541
OK?

180
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:24,986
I want you to do some research
and bring a strategy to present to me.

181
00:16:25,604 --> 00:16:29,459
If you can do that well, I'll
let you handle this brand.

182
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,725
Are you OK with that?

183
00:16:34,545 --> 00:16:35,379
I'm good with that.

184
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:37,379
I'll do my best.

185
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,252
You can take the product
samples to do some research.

186
00:16:53,784 --> 00:16:54,618
Come in.

187
00:17:00,609 --> 00:17:03,881
This is Nan, the Digital
Marketing specialist,

188
00:17:03,881 --> 00:17:05,616
she'll be advising every group.

189
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,582
If you have any problems,

190
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,729
you can consult with her.

191
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:16,740
Hello, pleased to meet you. I'm Pat.

192
00:17:17,721 --> 00:17:20,463
Hello Pat, I'm Nan.

193
00:17:32,826 --> 00:17:37,197
Before, I've never seen them act all high and
mighty, but now they are worse than ever.

194
00:17:38,612 --> 00:17:41,567
Think about it! How will the
board view our department?

195
00:17:42,468 --> 00:17:43,567
That's true.

196
00:17:43,568 --> 00:17:47,529
I'm so embarrassed! I don't
know where to hide my face!

197
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:50,551
One bad fish spoils
the whole barrel!

198
00:17:53,235 --> 00:17:54,334
Are you here for lunch?

199
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,108
Do you want to join us?

200
00:17:57,732 --> 00:18:03,071
Don't ask him to join us!
Just ask him to be polite!

201
00:18:03,628 --> 00:18:04,753
Pui.

202
00:18:05,336 --> 00:18:13,114
I think this is not OK, this chart
might make people confused,

203
00:18:13,241 --> 00:18:16,460
It's not professional at all!

204
00:18:16,836 --> 00:18:21,062
If the graph is an image like this
and the image blurry, do it all again.

205
00:18:21,553 --> 00:18:22,734
I also had that happen to me!

206
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:23,833
You too?

207
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,621
I thought it was only the three of us!

208
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:26,932
Are you crazy? I also was told that!

209
00:18:26,932 --> 00:18:30,522
I was like, OMG! Is this the
female version of Mr. Jeng?!

210
00:18:33,762 --> 00:18:35,762
Is she possessed by his spirit?!

211
00:18:36,689 --> 00:18:37,947
There's a female version of Mr. Jeng?

212
00:18:37,947 --> 00:18:39,258
She drives me crazy!

213
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:42,001
She's so full of it that it
causes trouble for us! Trouble!

214
00:18:42,001 --> 00:18:43,047
Yeah!

215
00:18:43,312 --> 00:18:44,464
Pat.

216
00:18:45,518 --> 00:18:47,253
Would you join us for some rice noodles?

217
00:18:47,253 --> 00:18:48,723
Ying made it herself.

218
00:18:48,723 --> 00:18:50,723
Ying makes delicious rice
noodles with massaman curry.

219
00:18:50,724 --> 00:18:51,770
It's good~.

220
00:18:53,395 --> 00:18:54,388
It's OK.

221
00:18:55,865 --> 00:18:57,547
And I heard everything that you guys said.

222
00:18:59,604 --> 00:19:00,597
What did he hear?

223
00:19:06,052 --> 00:19:06,727
What?

224
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,646
What did he hear?

225
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,993
What do you think he heard?

226
00:19:10,994 --> 00:19:12,093
No names were mentioned.

227
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,980
I didn't say a name!

228
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:15,186
Say her name?

229
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,079
Arm! Say a name!

230
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,444
No, you were just showing what happened!

231
00:19:19,444 --> 00:19:20,583
You started it.

232
00:19:22,889 --> 00:19:24,889
Who started it?

233
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,311
How are you Pat?

234
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:39,178
Have you eaten?

235
00:19:43,463 --> 00:19:44,509
I've eaten.

236
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,001
I brought my own lunch box.

237
00:19:48,463 --> 00:19:51,205
What... about you?

238
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,155
I already went to eat downstairs.

239
00:19:55,642 --> 00:19:56,794
How is work going?

240
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:02,477
Is there anything you need
help with? You can tell me!

241
00:20:04,656 --> 00:20:07,557
Are you scared of me?

242
00:20:08,537 --> 00:20:09,477
No.

243
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:13,795
What do you mean no? You're
moving away and your voice is shaking.

244
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:17,741
Come on, I won't bite!
Let me look at your slides.

245
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:28,815
I think your presentation,

246
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:33,903
is very interesting.

247
00:20:35,122 --> 00:20:38,765
It has new ways of telling information,

248
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,689
something I've never seen before.

249
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:42,919
After looking at each page,

250
00:20:43,526 --> 00:20:48,282
I can really picture it, how to
smoothly tell the story and not be boring.

251
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:51,054
But...

252
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,260
I think you should
add more of this.

253
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:56,750
I agree with expanding to many platforms.

254
00:20:57,329 --> 00:20:59,753
But many platforms means a higher budget,

255
00:20:59,753 --> 00:21:04,085
and if the budget is high, we'll need a
good reason to discuss it with Mr. Jeng.

256
00:21:05,356 --> 00:21:07,886
I think it's still not enough.

257
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,058
What if I added the reasons,

258
00:21:13,987 --> 00:21:18,796
That if we don't do it,
what will we missing out on?

259
00:21:21,465 --> 00:21:24,260
That would make your
presentation more solid.

260
00:21:24,513 --> 00:21:26,513
I think Mr. Jeng will buy this idea.

261
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:35,494
Nan.

262
00:21:36,024 --> 00:21:38,024
What do you think?

263
00:21:39,321 --> 00:21:43,335
Another thing is, you might want to use a softer font.

264
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:04,173
Wow! Our office has a coffee machine like this?

265
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,885
Do you want some?

266
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:06,532
Do you know how to make it?

267
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:07,504
Of course!

268
00:22:07,504 --> 00:22:08,550
Then I'll have some.

269
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,391
OK, I'll make it for you.

270
00:22:33,681 --> 00:22:36,105
He gave her a chicken!

271
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:41,547
I'll send it to Ying.

272
00:22:41,547 --> 00:22:42,630
Send it to the group!

273
00:22:42,631 --> 00:22:43,306
OK.

274
00:22:52,897 --> 00:22:54,155
Are the slides done?

275
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,349
Yes, they are finished.

276
00:22:55,783 --> 00:22:56,511
Come on.

277
00:23:14,248 --> 00:23:16,248
What do you think? Mr. Jeng..

278
00:23:21,451 --> 00:23:23,451
I think the first part is OK,

279
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,040
but I want you to add more
about what the consumers will gain.

280
00:23:27,854 --> 00:23:32,093
Because Forge's mini mart
focuses on selling healthy food,

281
00:23:33,301 --> 00:23:35,778
and don't forget the freshness.

282
00:23:37,665 --> 00:23:39,984
OK, I'll add it Mr. Jeng.

283
00:23:55,471 --> 00:23:57,206
Pat, come here.

284
00:23:57,206 --> 00:23:57,706
Huh?

285
00:23:58,509 --> 00:23:59,009
What?

286
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:01,577
I want to give you encouragement.

287
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:04,316
Fighting! Someday this will pass.

288
00:24:04,856 --> 00:24:07,386
When I first started working.

289
00:24:08,218 --> 00:24:10,435
I also went through this like you.

290
00:24:10,906 --> 00:24:11,640
Huh?

291
00:24:12,683 --> 00:24:13,517
Really?

292
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,086
You?

293
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:16,874
Yeah, of course.

294
00:24:17,002 --> 00:24:20,115
Do you think I just grew
up and knew how to work?

295
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:20,916
Yeah!

296
00:24:22,032 --> 00:24:22,960
No!

297
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,342
Someday Mr. Jeng will see
that you have the potential.

298
00:24:31,994 --> 00:24:34,740
Pat, Mr. Jeng is calling for you.

299
00:24:41,454 --> 00:24:42,977
I need to go now.

300
00:24:54,424 --> 00:24:59,710
Wow, one on one training!
How far did you get?

301
00:25:10,332 --> 00:25:14,099
Nowadays, Nan only focuses on Pat.

302
00:25:16,876 --> 00:25:20,254
Why? Does she only have to focus on you?

303
00:25:26,416 --> 00:25:30,271
She should pay equal attention to everyone!

304
00:25:30,369 --> 00:25:31,627
She's a specialist.

305
00:25:33,986 --> 00:25:38,583
Pat is a fresh graduate, of course
she has to guide him carefully.

306
00:25:40,517 --> 00:25:44,080
What about when you first graduated?
Did she pay that close attention to you?

307
00:25:46,135 --> 00:25:47,446
And most importantly.

308
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:52,625
I think that Mr. Jeng is
paving the way for Pat...

309
00:25:53,865 --> 00:25:56,110
To look after the
new brand product.

310
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:03,342
Maybe you want that for
yourself? So you're irritated by him.

311
00:26:05,075 --> 00:26:07,480
Yeah! I want to do it.

312
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:12,320
But actually it can be
anyone, even you Manao.

313
00:26:12,585 --> 00:26:14,744
But it should be someone with experience.

314
00:26:15,286 --> 00:26:16,809
I'm just worried that it will fall apart.

315
00:26:18,267 --> 00:26:20,120
Calm down,

316
00:26:21,422 --> 00:26:23,051
I understand how you're feeling.

317
00:27:06,229 --> 00:27:06,904
Come in.

318
00:27:11,086 --> 00:27:11,814
Take a seat.

319
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,702
I'm sorry to call you in
before the time we scheduled.

320
00:27:17,143 --> 00:27:19,695
But I have an urgent meeting at 4PM.

321
00:27:20,219 --> 00:27:21,960
Do you want me to do the presentation now?

322
00:27:22,138 --> 00:27:25,572
No but I want to comment
on your presentation a bit.

323
00:27:25,871 --> 00:27:26,599
OK.

324
00:27:27,316 --> 00:27:30,323
As for the information, I'm OK with it.

325
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:33,978
You show us the strengths
of our products well.

326
00:27:34,164 --> 00:27:36,164
Your storytelling got more interesting.

327
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,302
It indicates that Thai
people like to gamble,

328
00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:44,260
and then you connect with what Thai people
understand, like Gazapon or Random Box.

329
00:27:44,261 --> 00:27:47,798
But still maintains the
concept of freshness and health.

330
00:27:48,598 --> 00:27:49,914
I have to give you props for that.

331
00:27:51,726 --> 00:27:54,362
But the pages are not aligned.

332
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:57,040
Some parts are close to the
edge while some are far off from it.

333
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:01,014
Even if it's only a little bit but
I think it's doesn't look great.

334
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:06,353
You should set up these in a template, not
just copy and paste everything to the pages.

335
00:28:07,724 --> 00:28:11,320
You align the edges along the
paper, but every page is different.

336
00:28:11,321 --> 00:28:14,000
Go sort it again, I
want it to look cleaner.

337
00:28:15,368 --> 00:28:16,440
Every page?

338
00:28:16,647 --> 00:28:17,746
Every page.

339
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:20,994
As for the images.

340
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,288
What do you mean by this image?

341
00:28:24,289 --> 00:28:25,441
The image on page 22.

342
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:30,000
This image is too straight forward.

343
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:37,240
You should use images that
inspire and persuade people.

344
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:42,233
I highly recommend it if you
want to succeed as a marketer.

345
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:44,890
You should understand both art and science.

346
00:28:45,837 --> 00:28:49,480
OK, I understand that it's still not OK.

347
00:28:49,735 --> 00:28:51,735
I'll fix it.

348
00:28:58,415 --> 00:29:00,280
Oh, another thing.

349
00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:03,789
This might seem like a personal matter.

350
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:08,556
But you seem to have gotten close with Nan.

351
00:29:09,774 --> 00:29:11,774
I'm worried that people
might get the wrong idea.

352
00:29:12,582 --> 00:29:14,211
There's nothing going on.

353
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:17,200
She's like a big sister that I can talk to.

354
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,486
I understand.

355
00:29:18,706 --> 00:29:21,554
But you know how the people are here.

356
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,310
What do you expect me to do?

357
00:29:26,043 --> 00:29:27,725
Just keep your distance.

358
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:32,680
We're not close like that.

359
00:29:32,928 --> 00:29:34,928
But other people won't think like that.

360
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,587
I just don't want it to become a problem.

361
00:29:36,854 --> 00:29:39,702
Because she's in a
higher position than you.

362
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,668
I'm afraid it might not look good.

363
00:29:44,837 --> 00:29:46,413
Please excuse me.

364
00:29:54,481 --> 00:29:55,739
Add more pictures.

365
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:02,853
I'll be right back.

366
00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:09,719
What did Mr. Jeng say this time?

367
00:30:12,656 --> 00:30:13,384
Hmm?

368
00:30:26,141 --> 00:30:28,960
Oh, I just need to fix the slides a bit.

369
00:30:29,437 --> 00:30:32,280
Don't worry, I can handle it myself.

370
00:30:32,761 --> 00:30:33,435
Are you sure?

371
00:30:34,644 --> 00:30:36,644
OK, if you need something just tell me.

372
00:30:37,516 --> 00:30:38,016
Bye.

373
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:38,541
Thank you.

374
00:30:41,825 --> 00:30:42,500
Sure.

375
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,938
I think you should expand it a bit.

376
00:30:56,225 --> 00:30:59,073
Do you want to go out and
eat? I need to talk to you.

377
00:31:06,052 --> 00:31:09,218
Same place? Ae?

378
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:14,538
See you at the digital trend
event. Did you receive the email?

379
00:31:38,209 --> 00:31:40,209
A glass of Fuji Matcha please.

380
00:31:54,006 --> 00:31:54,999
Ae!

381
00:31:56,966 --> 00:31:59,072
You didn't answer my texts!

382
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:01,288
Why did you come here?

383
00:32:05,015 --> 00:32:06,194
Who are you eating with?

384
00:32:07,121 --> 00:32:08,008
I'm with..

385
00:32:08,938 --> 00:32:09,560
Um..

386
00:32:10,753 --> 00:32:11,253
Pat.

387
00:32:28,216 --> 00:32:29,315
Pat..

388
00:32:32,298 --> 00:32:33,662
Pat! Wait! Pat!

389
00:32:35,136 --> 00:32:36,712
Put.

390
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:42,224
Why didn't anyone tell me
that Pat is back in Thailand?

391
00:32:43,912 --> 00:32:48,160
Um.. Put.. Let me explain.

392
00:32:50,265 --> 00:32:52,834
Let him go first, don't go after him yet.

393
00:32:59,275 --> 00:33:00,215
Pat.

394
00:33:01,832 --> 00:33:03,832
Pat! Open the door.

395
00:33:05,425 --> 00:33:07,425
Open the door!

396
00:33:12,286 --> 00:33:16,120
Pat! I'm sorry! I wasn't looking at my
phone and had no idea you'd show up there!

397
00:33:18,102 --> 00:33:19,000
Pat?

398
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:23,299
Ae, could you stop being
dramatic? It's not locked.

399
00:33:24,704 --> 00:33:26,704
I always have to be dramatic.

400
00:33:27,216 --> 00:33:29,216
I just want to say I'm sorry.

401
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,678
I'm really sorry, it's just..

402
00:33:32,155 --> 00:33:34,480
I truly didn't look at my phone.

403
00:33:34,709 --> 00:33:38,511
I'm working on an advertisement
with Put so I had to meet him.

404
00:33:38,536 --> 00:33:39,885
It was like talking to a client.

405
00:33:40,206 --> 00:33:40,881
Do you understand?

406
00:33:42,257 --> 00:33:43,400
Why didn't you tell me.

407
00:33:44,427 --> 00:33:46,860
I thought if you heard
his name, you'd feel bad.

408
00:33:47,286 --> 00:33:48,968
And you're under so much stress.

409
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:52,679
But it's such a coincidence that
you'd end up at the same place.

410
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:58,082
Here.

411
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:01,340
What is it?

412
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,498
Are you trying to bribe me?

413
00:34:03,498 --> 00:34:04,740
Ah! No!

414
00:34:05,441 --> 00:34:07,494
Let's just call it a gift
to calm your nerves.

415
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:10,782
Could you stop being mad at me? I'm sorry.

416
00:34:11,033 --> 00:34:13,351
Fine, I'm not mad.

417
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:16,153
Because you'll get tired to
trying to make me less mad at you.

418
00:34:16,178 --> 00:34:19,260
Oh! You're the cutest!

419
00:34:24,546 --> 00:34:27,818
You promise? That it was only work related?

420
00:34:30,436 --> 00:34:31,164
It's true!

421
00:34:32,716 --> 00:34:33,338
It's true.

422
00:34:33,618 --> 00:34:34,929
Why would I lie to you?

423
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:35,958
Right?

424
00:34:37,601 --> 00:34:39,900
Fine, I believe you.

425
00:34:39,901 --> 00:34:43,180
What about Nan? What are you going to do?

426
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,070
What about this?

427
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,127
Get one of your ex-boyfriends
to send you flowers.

428
00:34:49,742 --> 00:34:50,629
Ae!

429
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:53,212
No, I can't.

430
00:34:54,353 --> 00:34:54,975
Fine.

431
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,271
It's from your favorite place.

432
00:35:17,506 --> 00:35:19,020
Here you go.

433
00:35:19,676 --> 00:35:21,676
Thank you.

434
00:35:22,758 --> 00:35:23,780
But wait..

435
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,420
Why are you dressed so nicely today?

436
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,460
I have to go to an event with Mr. Jeng.

437
00:35:31,232 --> 00:35:34,451
Oh! Fighting!

438
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:41,700
Oh! You're here!

439
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,912
There are some flowers for Pat!

440
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:47,788
Oh..

441
00:35:51,486 --> 00:35:55,394
Um, Happy One Month Anniversary!

442
00:35:55,895 --> 00:35:59,432
Oh! So cute!

443
00:36:00,629 --> 00:36:04,590
Did I read it wrong?

444
00:36:04,899 --> 00:36:05,892
It's OK.

445
00:36:07,449 --> 00:36:09,900
But please respect my privacy.

446
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:18,650
Oh, um.. Please excuse me.

447
00:36:19,181 --> 00:36:20,121
OK.

448
00:36:25,581 --> 00:36:28,588
What is that? Let me see.

449
00:36:29,697 --> 00:36:32,386
Happy One Month Anniversary.. Why
didn't you tell me you're seeing someone?

450
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:35,100
No.. I ordered it myself.

451
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:35,918
Hmm?

452
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:40,477
So that people would stop
gossiping, that we're dating.

453
00:36:40,808 --> 00:36:42,808
Ohhh.

454
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:45,268
Starting one rumor to fight another.

455
00:36:46,095 --> 00:36:51,063
Why don't you just tell people
that you're gay? It's so much easier.

456
00:36:54,714 --> 00:36:57,827
I don't want to come out yet.

457
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,105
Understandable.

458
00:37:01,741 --> 00:37:04,377
It's a good thing,
there's chocolate to eat.

459
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:05,864
Um, I want this one.

460
00:37:11,042 --> 00:37:13,042
Mr. Jeng: Are you ready?

461
00:37:13,586 --> 00:37:16,063
I have to go now.

462
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:19,338
Mr. Jeng.. Um..

463
00:37:21,413 --> 00:37:22,900
This is good.

464
00:37:23,748 --> 00:37:24,741
Share some with me too.

465
00:37:25,526 --> 00:37:26,201
Sure.

466
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,808
In 2023..

467
00:37:38,961 --> 00:37:45,202
Short-Form Video or vertical videos are wildly popular.

468
00:37:45,467 --> 00:37:48,421
Which comes from the change in consumer habit.

469
00:37:48,526 --> 00:37:51,744
We use mobile phones as the main means of accessing the Internet,

470
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:54,499
we scroll through our phones in a matter of seconds.

471
00:37:54,737 --> 00:37:59,875
According to statistics, Short-Frame Videos
have more engagement than any other content.

472
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:03,620
That is because the content is short,
concise, easy to watch and engaging,

473
00:38:03,973 --> 00:38:08,517
Brand owners, marketers,
and agencies can also measure,

474
00:38:08,517 --> 00:38:10,782
and recheck in real time as well.

475
00:38:10,983 --> 00:38:15,060
And one more thing that is very important
in the marketing of short form video,

476
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,740
is the relationship with influencers.

477
00:38:17,975 --> 00:38:19,900
Which today we are honored,

478
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:24,354
by an artist, singer,
actor who is on the rise,

479
00:38:24,371 --> 00:38:26,580
he is also an online
media influencer as well!

480
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:32,603
I would like to invite Mr. Put
Phacharaphol Thanawongsarat on stage.

481
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,220
Hello.

482
00:38:42,266 --> 00:38:42,888
Hi.

483
00:38:42,889 --> 00:38:44,540
Hello.

484
00:38:49,668 --> 00:38:51,220
I can honestly say that.

485
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,545
I've never been given an opportunity like
this before, this is really my first time,

486
00:38:54,546 --> 00:38:59,900
and I am very happy that today I will
be sharing some interesting information.

487
00:39:00,441 --> 00:39:02,060
As an influencer.

488
00:39:16,368 --> 00:39:17,096
Mr. Put.

489
00:39:19,636 --> 00:39:20,136
Yes.

490
00:39:22,681 --> 00:39:30,696
Word of mouth is very important for us to make
decisions in selecting products or services.

491
00:39:31,023 --> 00:39:34,189
But I can tell you
that in this digital age.

492
00:39:34,189 --> 00:39:36,401
Influencers are equally important.

493
00:39:36,651 --> 00:39:38,174
Whether it's talking about the brand name,

494
00:39:38,174 --> 00:39:40,704
posting or writing articles.

495
00:39:41,357 --> 00:39:44,152
Or other media such as video clips,

496
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:48,557
we will be able to make our brand
known to the wider audience as well.

497
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:55,589
So let me tell you that influencer
marketing tends to keep growing,

498
00:39:56,074 --> 00:39:58,869
and expand continuously on every platform.

499
00:40:15,853 --> 00:40:21,405
The event was amazing, I hope the Jian
Group will get to work with your company.

500
00:40:23,594 --> 00:40:24,094
Yes.

501
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,969
Excuse me for a moment, please.

502
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:34,371
Mr. Jeng, let's go.

503
00:40:35,102 --> 00:40:35,980
Hello Mr. Jeng.

504
00:40:36,507 --> 00:40:37,765
Hello Mr. Put.

505
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:39,900
Long time no see.

506
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,860
I didn't think that I'd see you here.

507
00:40:43,365 --> 00:40:46,690
Jian Group sponsored
this so I have to come.

508
00:40:47,084 --> 00:40:48,077
Oh...

509
00:40:52,465 --> 00:40:56,744
Please excuse me,
I need to go to the restroom.

510
00:40:58,846 --> 00:41:01,278
Sure, of course.

511
00:41:07,736 --> 00:41:09,736
So Pat is your secretary?

512
00:41:10,806 --> 00:41:12,594
No, he's on my team.

513
00:41:12,641 --> 00:41:14,657
I'm back to being the department's manager.

514
00:41:15,113 --> 00:41:15,682
Oh..

515
00:41:17,614 --> 00:41:20,260
Do you know Pat?

516
00:41:21,853 --> 00:41:22,475
Yes.

517
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:26,620
I knew him when he
was a student intern.

518
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:31,612
Oh OK.

519
00:42:03,289 --> 00:42:04,441
Hello.

520
00:42:05,536 --> 00:42:07,546
There's so much work to do.

521
00:42:28,281 --> 00:42:29,592
I want to sleep now.

522
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,380
Woke up early.

523
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,075
You should help me instead!

524
00:42:53,459 --> 00:42:56,500
Pat! Turn off the damn
computer! We're at a bar!

525
00:42:58,005 --> 00:42:58,876
Hey!

526
00:42:59,381 --> 00:42:59,900
What?

527
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,476
Just let him work a bit more.

528
00:43:02,123 --> 00:43:03,222
Fresh graduates are
work crazy like this.

529
00:43:03,738 --> 00:43:05,685
It looks more like
revenge-fueled work to me.

530
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:06,552
Revenge?

531
00:43:07,023 --> 00:43:07,780
Look!

532
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,089
Hey, Pat.

533
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:10,488
Drink a glass.

534
00:43:11,242 --> 00:43:11,742
Pat.

535
00:43:12,367 --> 00:43:13,519
Just drink one so work will be easier.

536
00:43:13,544 --> 00:43:14,431
It's fine Beam.

537
00:43:14,699 --> 00:43:15,199
Huh.

538
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,540
It's OK Beam, you drink it.

539
00:43:20,772 --> 00:43:23,302
All you do is work.

540
00:43:25,623 --> 00:43:26,616
Pat, open your mouth.

541
00:43:27,585 --> 00:43:31,420
Ah, eat~.

542
00:43:33,161 --> 00:43:34,100
Is it delicious?

543
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,340
Silent, no answer.

544
00:43:37,569 --> 00:43:39,675
Mr. Jeng has a really bad mouth.

545
00:43:39,901 --> 00:43:42,908
Instead of speaking kindly to other
people, treating them with kindness.

546
00:43:43,866 --> 00:43:46,084
Do you think of yourself as the
son of the company's president?

547
00:43:46,645 --> 00:43:48,940
So you can do anything you want?
Who does he think he is?

548
00:43:50,147 --> 00:43:54,420
And Ying! I really want to strangle her.

549
00:43:54,613 --> 00:43:55,447
You want to strangle her, right?

550
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:58,997
Seniority is so annoying!

551
00:44:00,321 --> 00:44:04,971
Ae, don't forget that
Pat is also in the wrong.

552
00:44:05,607 --> 00:44:08,220
You just can't side with him like this.

553
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:10,139
Did I say that he wasn't in the wrong?

554
00:44:10,765 --> 00:44:14,900
But at least he knows that,
but does that Jeng guy know?

555
00:44:15,571 --> 00:44:18,419
Or he doesn't care and
just wants to be fierce?

556
00:44:18,945 --> 00:44:20,945
People can just die and he doesn't mind.

557
00:44:21,445 --> 00:44:24,372
That's enough, we're here to relax.

558
00:44:24,397 --> 00:44:28,660
Sure, you one to talk.

559
00:44:29,418 --> 00:44:31,060
The computer is still on.

560
00:44:31,206 --> 00:44:31,828
Oh..

561
00:44:32,174 --> 00:44:33,803
You!

562
00:44:34,395 --> 00:44:36,751
This is called changing the workplace!

563
00:44:37,661 --> 00:44:39,396
Hey, hey, relax.

564
00:44:39,639 --> 00:44:40,367
Yes!

565
00:44:41,066 --> 00:44:42,165
What should I do?

566
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:42,666
Huh?

567
00:44:42,919 --> 00:44:45,078
He's not drinking, he
won't get drunk for sure.

568
00:44:46,258 --> 00:44:50,740
He also won't dance, but before that,
he walked around like an MP.

569
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:52,935
Plus sometimes he invite
other people to sing too!

570
00:44:53,294 --> 00:44:56,778
Well, you're right, you're right.

571
00:44:57,279 --> 00:44:58,060
That's right.

572
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,672
Why?

573
00:45:02,221 --> 00:45:02,843
You too!

574
00:45:04,664 --> 00:45:07,263
We won't talk about the past,
we will talk about the present.

575
00:45:07,263 --> 00:45:07,763
Really?

576
00:45:07,764 --> 00:45:08,386
Yes.

577
00:45:15,962 --> 00:45:17,962
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

578
00:45:18,842 --> 00:45:21,425
Pat, what's wrong with you? Get up!

579
00:45:21,426 --> 00:45:23,020
Shhhhh softly.

580
00:45:23,021 --> 00:45:24,756
What's wrong with you?

581
00:45:24,756 --> 00:45:25,940
Mr. Jeng is here.

582
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:26,615
Huh?

583
00:45:27,136 --> 00:45:28,553
He says, really cool.

584
00:45:28,564 --> 00:45:29,557
He's really cool!

585
00:45:29,557 --> 00:45:30,057
I'm really cool?

586
00:45:32,092 --> 00:45:35,152
You're so scared that you're hallucinating! Get up!

587
00:45:36,194 --> 00:45:36,980
Pat.

588
00:45:38,526 --> 00:45:39,380
Where?

589
00:45:41,546 --> 00:45:43,440
I don't see anyone.

590
00:45:43,794 --> 00:45:46,054
Let me see his face, he
made my little baby bro

591
00:45:46,078 --> 00:45:48,338
cry so many times! I
need to teach him a lesson!

592
00:45:48,338 --> 00:45:49,649
Hey, hey! Wait!

593
00:45:49,981 --> 00:45:51,133
Have you ever seen his face?

594
00:45:51,141 --> 00:45:52,420
Well, that's what he said.

595
00:45:52,421 --> 00:45:53,043
I don't see anyone.

596
00:45:53,043 --> 00:45:53,980
He's sitting right there.

597
00:45:55,478 --> 00:45:56,365
I'll go first

598
00:45:56,365 --> 00:45:57,260
what?

599
00:45:57,261 --> 00:45:58,042
Hey! Stop.

600
00:45:58,042 --> 00:45:59,178
It happened so many times!

601
00:45:59,178 --> 00:45:59,900
Stop! You too!

602
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:01,852
Pat.

603
00:46:02,457 --> 00:46:03,238
Pat.

604
00:46:03,299 --> 00:46:03,974
Pat.

605
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:06,038
Well...

606
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:08,839
He just left us hanging.

607
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:12,140
You're responsible for
this, let's just get drunk.

608
00:46:20,167 --> 00:46:21,140
Again?

609
00:46:25,707 --> 00:46:27,140
This is not mine.

610
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,158
Oh, isn't that your name?

611
00:46:36,636 --> 00:46:37,900
So cute!

612
00:46:40,292 --> 00:46:41,656
I'm going to go work now.

613
00:46:47,547 --> 00:46:48,116
Pat.

614
00:46:49,308 --> 00:46:49,900
Yes.

615
00:47:09,666 --> 00:47:14,740
Last night I went through your slides
and took the liberty to correct them.

616
00:47:15,423 --> 00:47:17,264
Because it's unlikely
that you'd finish it in time.

617
00:47:18,431 --> 00:47:21,279
Ms.Nadia is in Thailand
so we had to hurry.

618
00:47:23,665 --> 00:47:26,407
Can I ask where I made a mistake?

619
00:47:27,038 --> 00:47:28,402
So that I can improve myself.

620
00:47:28,975 --> 00:47:32,260
It's the same old problems,
your slides still don't look clean.

621
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:35,773
The pictures you use to
communicate are too direct.

622
00:47:38,644 --> 00:47:43,980
Oh, Aeoy is busy today so I need
you to take notes during the meeting too.

623
00:47:52,648 --> 00:47:55,236
So that concludes our presentation.

624
00:47:55,766 --> 00:47:56,547
Thank you.

625
00:47:58,906 --> 00:48:01,754
Okay, Thank you very much.

626
00:48:02,011 --> 00:48:07,563
I think the strategy part is
great, simple but powerful.

627
00:48:07,946 --> 00:48:12,039
However, can you please
go back to slide number 12.

628
00:48:20,378 --> 00:48:24,657
I think mood and tone
here it's a bit boring.

629
00:48:25,523 --> 00:48:31,740
I suggest you to come up with something
more newer, we need something more trendier.

630
00:48:32,018 --> 00:48:33,488
Can you do that?

631
00:48:37,565 --> 00:48:39,565
Umm, Excuse me.

632
00:48:39,757 --> 00:48:40,962
Yes, Pat.

633
00:48:41,314 --> 00:48:44,003
So I have something to present.

634
00:48:44,483 --> 00:48:44,983
Okay.

635
00:48:49,398 --> 00:48:50,540
Here!

636
00:48:57,050 --> 00:49:02,018
I think this is amazing, this
is exactly what we needed.

637
00:49:02,203 --> 00:49:04,839
Well done Pat, This is great.

638
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:06,940
Thank you.

639
00:49:25,694 --> 00:49:27,694
Hey Pat!

640
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:31,306
You seem pretty quiet
but you're quite the man!

641
00:49:31,899 --> 00:49:33,104
What?

642
00:49:33,388 --> 00:49:37,243
You have a girlfriend
but Nan totally likes you!

643
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:41,206
Tell me, was she hot?

644
00:49:43,575 --> 00:49:45,575
We're not dating.

645
00:49:47,046 --> 00:49:47,980
I know that!

646
00:49:48,613 --> 00:49:50,295
I can see it.

647
00:49:50,295 --> 00:49:51,580
Well? How's she?

648
00:49:55,277 --> 00:49:56,906
It's true, I'm gay.

649
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,460
What?

650
00:50:00,494 --> 00:50:01,593
Don't take it too seriously.

651
00:50:03,214 --> 00:50:06,539
We're guys, I won't tell anyone!

652
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:10,310
It's true, I'm not into women.

653
00:50:14,943 --> 00:50:15,780
So that means..

654
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,522
Nan is your girl bestie?

655
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:27,834
Looking at your body,

656
00:50:28,876 --> 00:50:30,820
and butt.

657
00:50:31,659 --> 00:50:32,595
Are you a bottom?

658
00:50:32,595 --> 00:50:33,125
Right?

659
00:50:33,125 --> 00:50:34,494
What the hell?!

660
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,018
Hey, Pat!

661
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:37,651
Calm down.

662
00:50:38,231 --> 00:50:39,065
Pat!

663
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:43,108
Mr. Jeng is calling for you.

664
00:50:45,138 --> 00:50:46,714
I was just playing around.

665
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:48,640
Could you stop acting
like an straight white male?

666
00:50:49,064 --> 00:50:50,100
It's disgusting!

667
00:51:17,078 --> 00:51:18,220
Come in.

668
00:51:22,524 --> 00:51:23,460
Mr. Jeng..

669
00:51:23,918 --> 00:51:27,349
If it's about today, can we
talk about it another time?

670
00:51:32,934 --> 00:51:34,045
Please take a seat.

671
00:51:42,462 --> 00:51:45,734
Lately, you've been
doing very well.

672
00:51:47,252 --> 00:51:48,580
Your ideas are good.

673
00:51:49,603 --> 00:51:51,980
I have to accept
your ability there.

674
00:51:53,064 --> 00:51:53,820
Yes.

675
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:57,392
But if you have something
you want to present.

676
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:01,119
You should have let me
know first, don't do it like that.

677
00:52:01,668 --> 00:52:03,668
Just suddenly saying it,

678
00:52:03,669 --> 00:52:06,180
without me knowing anything about
it, I can't answer questions about it.

679
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,180
I've never seen those pictures

680
00:52:08,645 --> 00:52:10,060
I've already sent it to you.

681
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,214
No, not yet.

682
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:12,500
No.

683
00:52:13,515 --> 00:52:16,922
If you told me first, we would have been
able to paste the picture on the slide to

684
00:52:16,954 --> 00:52:20,650
make it neat and beautiful. Instead of opening
them from a disorganized folder like that.

685
00:52:22,427 --> 00:52:25,060
Or are you deliberately doing this
because you want to get back at me?

686
00:52:27,381 --> 00:52:29,900
Don't mix your personal emotions with your work.

687
00:53:01,913 --> 00:53:03,740
Pat, why are you crying?

688
00:53:07,782 --> 00:53:09,900
If you cry at work like this,

689
00:53:09,901 --> 00:53:11,901
do you know how other people will see you?

690
00:53:13,439 --> 00:53:14,644
How?

691
00:53:14,805 --> 00:53:16,381
That you're not an adult.

692
00:53:16,807 --> 00:53:18,807
It undermines your credibility.

693
00:53:20,481 --> 00:53:21,739
I think that,

694
00:53:22,216 --> 00:53:24,540
You're afraid that you
won't look very good.

695
00:53:30,216 --> 00:53:33,488
I'm sorry for crying in your office.

696
00:53:49,397 --> 00:53:49,900
Pat.

697
00:53:51,753 --> 00:53:52,481
Pat.

698
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:53,299
Pat.

699
00:55:24,153 --> 00:55:25,093
Request to resign...

700
00:55:25,093 --> 00:55:27,411
To Mr. Kittipong Attachiranon,
Managing Director of Jian Group Co., Ltd.

701
00:55:27,412 --> 00:55:31,055
I'm Mr. Pakpoom Tangwattana.

702
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,420
Digital Marketing Officer, Jian Group Co., Ltd.
Wishing to resign from being a company employee for reasons..

703
00:55:34,781 --> 00:55:36,220
(Peer Review)

704
00:55:57,436 --> 00:55:59,648
Hello, Ae, are you free tonight?

705
00:56:00,309 --> 00:56:01,461
We have a red alert.

706
00:56:14,261 --> 00:56:17,427
Any way I try to say his name,
it's like I'm complimenting him!

707
00:56:17,724 --> 00:56:19,141
Jeng! (Means cool in Thai)

708
00:56:19,327 --> 00:56:19,900
Jeng.

709
00:56:20,871 --> 00:56:27,300
Now I'll politely curse back with the
academic vocabulary that Mr. Jeng wants!

710
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:28,294
Do it!

711
00:56:28,295 --> 00:56:29,553
Do it now!

712
00:56:36,917 --> 00:56:41,408
My manager shows consideration for me as a person.

713
00:56:43,555 --> 00:56:46,933
Take 1 star out of 5!

714
00:56:47,037 --> 00:56:49,249
You never care about me at all!

715
00:56:49,391 --> 00:56:51,220
Never care about me at all!

716
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:52,500
Awesome!

717
00:56:53,235 --> 00:56:54,546
Drink slower.

718
00:56:56,016 --> 00:56:57,168
I don't drink every day.

719
00:56:57,168 --> 00:56:58,585
I see you drink every single day.

720
00:56:58,585 --> 00:56:59,635
Don't say it.

721
00:57:01,416 --> 00:57:05,140
My manager does not "micromanage".

722
00:57:07,347 --> 00:57:09,347
Micromanage?

723
00:57:11,611 --> 00:57:12,975
What is that?

724
00:57:16,448 --> 00:57:17,140
I don't know.

725
00:57:17,202 --> 00:57:17,983
What?

726
00:57:18,946 --> 00:57:21,529
I think you should ask the professor.

727
00:57:21,903 --> 00:57:22,631
Professor?

728
00:57:22,645 --> 00:57:23,850
Professor Google.

729
00:57:23,851 --> 00:57:26,010
Oh, Professor Goo!

730
00:57:28,009 --> 00:57:28,790
Do you know?

731
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:32,420
Micromanage..

732
00:57:36,002 --> 00:57:39,381
Micromanage is the work of..

733
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:42,458
A manager with..

734
00:57:43,465 --> 00:57:48,660
Finicky management behavior!

735
00:57:50,249 --> 00:57:54,263
Yeah! Mr. Jeng micromanages everything!

736
00:57:54,264 --> 00:57:54,992
Right!

737
00:57:54,993 --> 00:57:56,993
If you don't trust Pat like that.

738
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,268
Why don't he just do all the work himself?

739
00:57:59,269 --> 00:57:59,900
Right?

740
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:03,300
Yep, do everything himself so
he knows how other people feel.

741
00:58:04,766 --> 00:58:06,925
I'm not surprised why he's
cursed by his subordinates.

742
00:58:07,715 --> 00:58:09,260
I think you're being too involved.

743
00:58:09,481 --> 00:58:09,981
How?

744
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:12,750
Well, maybe he's not like that.

745
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:16,389
Or he might be pressured
by the people around him.

746
00:58:17,335 --> 00:58:18,434
So he must be like that.

747
00:58:19,215 --> 00:58:21,427
Who wants to sit and curse
other people every day?

748
00:58:21,693 --> 00:58:23,322
Why are you siding with him?

749
00:58:24,784 --> 00:58:26,148
So what is he is pressured by?

750
00:58:26,705 --> 00:58:28,334
Does he have to take it out on Pat?

751
00:58:31,134 --> 00:58:34,512
He's just a small employee! Look!

752
00:58:34,916 --> 00:58:38,771
Well, I understand but I just don't
want you to judge him like that.

753
00:58:39,513 --> 00:58:43,262
I mean, you weren't there when it happened
and you're just listening to his words.

754
00:58:43,924 --> 00:58:47,460
I think you're prejudiced
against rich people.

755
00:58:47,461 --> 00:58:48,885
I'm not prejudiced.

756
00:58:50,117 --> 00:58:52,020
I'm just mad at what he did to Pat!

757
00:58:53,381 --> 00:58:54,780
What about you?

758
00:58:55,649 --> 00:58:58,444
When your boss worked you so
hard that you had to go to the hospital?

759
00:58:59,009 --> 00:59:00,300
You were cursing him!

760
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:04,180
Now you're acting like
you're in fields of lavender.

761
00:59:04,797 --> 00:59:07,433
You can say that because
it's not happening to you!

762
00:59:09,511 --> 00:59:10,186
OK!!

763
00:59:14,195 --> 00:59:14,923
What?

764
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:15,780
Why?

765
00:59:16,387 --> 00:59:17,409
Fine, you win.

766
00:59:18,556 --> 00:59:19,319
Do it Pat!!

767
00:59:19,461 --> 00:59:20,719
Now?

768
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:21,219
Put everything you got into it!

769
00:59:21,219 --> 00:59:21,719
Everything!

770
00:59:22,501 --> 00:59:23,123
Cheers!

771
00:59:23,228 --> 00:59:23,850
Cheers!

772
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:24,843
Put everything into it!

773
00:59:24,843 --> 00:59:25,624
Go!

774
00:59:36,712 --> 00:59:37,817
You...

775
00:59:38,486 --> 00:59:39,900
Nope.

776
00:59:40,381 --> 00:59:48,530
My manager micromanages me which causes discomfort.

777
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:49,485
Yeah.

778
00:59:49,901 --> 00:59:58,100
He always wanted to direct everything in his own way.

779
00:59:58,659 --> 00:59:59,281
Go!

780
00:59:59,281 --> 01:00:05,983
It felt as if he never trusted me,

781
01:00:05,983 --> 01:00:06,620
Yeah.

782
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:11,853
And that really demotivated me.

783
01:00:11,853 --> 01:00:12,581
OK.

784
01:00:13,969 --> 01:00:15,420
Is it too harsh?

785
01:00:18,043 --> 01:00:18,660
Forget it.

786
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:19,494
Hey! Wait!

787
01:00:21,334 --> 01:00:22,433
Did you already send it?

788
01:00:22,716 --> 01:00:23,216
Yeah.

789
01:00:24,555 --> 01:00:27,562
Um, typing it in English like that.

790
01:00:28,267 --> 01:00:29,419
I think he knows.

791
01:00:32,615 --> 01:00:34,297
You can be fired!

792
01:00:36,111 --> 01:00:36,611
What?

793
01:00:36,636 --> 01:00:37,947
Why are you stopping him?

794
01:00:38,448 --> 01:00:39,940
Do it!

795
01:00:40,228 --> 01:00:41,940
Will you help him if he gets fired?

796
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:42,940
Is he fired yet?

797
01:00:43,548 --> 01:00:46,078
Yeah, I wanted him to think it over.

798
01:00:46,897 --> 01:00:48,140
Ummm...

799
01:00:49,637 --> 01:00:51,743
Give me some more, I drank it all.

800
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:55,806
Send it!!

801
01:00:56,322 --> 01:00:57,686
Shit...!

802
01:00:57,952 --> 01:00:59,157
You sent it?!

803
01:00:59,636 --> 01:01:01,371
So slow.

804
