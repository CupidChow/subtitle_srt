1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,001
I want to ask you to Tae's birthday party,
at Pearl & Oliver with me as a friend.

2
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:07,862
Ah, there he is! Hey! Jeng, over here!

3
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:15,000
It would be better,
if we knew each other not as work subordinates.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,287
But it's a good thing that we're just friends.

5
00:00:17,287 --> 00:00:20,670
But if you were my boss,

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,520
I'd be waving goodbye.

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,030
I intend to improve myself.

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,476
I want to change myself to be a better leader.

9
00:00:26,476 --> 00:00:30,259
I hope that one day
Pat will get to know the real me more.

10
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:35,048
He's really overacting.

11
00:00:35,048 --> 00:00:39,085
Closing up a whole badminton court
for his underlings!

12
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:43,139
Don't you think Mr. Jeng is kind of weird?

13
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:46,817
Maybe it's because he's not in his suit?

14
00:00:46,817 --> 00:00:47,861
It's his clothes?

15
00:00:47,861 --> 00:00:51,404
No, it's not that.

16
00:00:51,404 --> 00:00:53,146
Then what is it?

17
00:00:54,566 --> 00:00:56,444
It's how Mr. Jeng is acting.

18
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,086
Ah, don't you remember?

19
00:00:59,086 --> 00:01:00,050
That day...

20
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:05,971
I'm going to end our meeting right here.

21
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:07,331
Thank you so much.

22
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:17,214
But before everyone leaves...

23
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:20,899
But before everyone leaves...

24
00:01:28,302 --> 00:01:30,000
But before everyone leaves...

25
00:01:30,863 --> 00:01:32,863
I have an announcement to make.

26
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:38,753
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:39,354 --> 00:01:43,008
If I said or did something that
made anyone uncomfortable before.

28
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:48,653
I'm saying this honestly because,
I want to see the work come out well.

29
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:52,308
I see job success as the most important thing.

30
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,646
And it was never personal.

31
00:02:08,685 --> 00:02:13,380
On the first Wednesday of the month,
Mr. Chot, our Senior Executive,

32
00:02:15,364 --> 00:02:17,670
with Mr. Toh, his Personal Assistant
will be joining us.

33
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:20,161
This is my personal assistant.

34
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:24,740
They will come to help the team,
and should make it easier for us to work together.

35
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,012
If everyone has a problem,
you can consult with these 2 people.

36
00:02:31,617 --> 00:02:35,577
Someone told me good team relationship,

37
00:02:35,577 --> 00:02:38,050
will make us work smoothly.

38
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,008
So I thought that after this,

39
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:45,563
I want to find activities
that allow us to spend time together,

40
00:02:45,563 --> 00:02:47,455
to bring us closer.

41
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:50,069
So I would like to invite everyone...

42
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,441
To an Outing.

43
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:53,101
Outing?

44
00:02:53,101 --> 00:02:54,130
An Outing?

45
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:54,698
Outing?

46
00:02:56,025 --> 00:02:59,494
Outing! Outing! Outing! Outing!

47
00:02:59,494 --> 00:03:01,507
I'd like to invite everyone,

48
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,902
golfing this Sunday.

49
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:12,480
Golfing? Golfing is great.

50
00:03:14,003 --> 00:03:15,268
Golfing?

51
00:03:22,431 --> 00:03:23,635
Mr. Jeng?

52
00:03:23,635 --> 00:03:26,240
Should we switch to Badminton?

53
00:03:28,253 --> 00:03:30,743
Badminton! Badminton!

54
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:35,157
Yeah, let's play Badminton.

55
00:03:35,157 --> 00:03:36,226
Badminton.

56
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,497
Right?

57
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,423
I think Ying is right.

58
00:03:40,764 --> 00:03:42,274
So you're not going to think?

59
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:46,933
That what could make someone change themselves?

60
00:03:47,324 --> 00:03:48,712
What makes someone change!

61
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:53,526
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:54,126 --> 00:03:56,126
Sorry, I'll take a rest.

63
00:03:56,126 --> 00:03:59,181
Me too, I'm beat.

64
00:03:59,181 --> 00:04:03,723
People are like this and don't change,
do you understand?

65
00:04:05,866 --> 00:04:06,575
Change?

66
00:04:07,116 --> 00:04:09,116
Who changed?

67
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:13,428
You're new so you probably don't know.

68
00:04:13,428 --> 00:04:17,014
The real Mr. Jeng is not like this.

69
00:04:23,802 --> 00:04:25,251
So what is he really like?

70
00:04:25,251 --> 00:04:27,244
Heh! He's strict!

71
00:04:27,244 --> 00:04:27,887
Intense!

72
00:04:27,887 --> 00:04:28,815
Precise!

73
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:29,744
He's very straight forward.

74
00:04:29,744 --> 00:04:30,929
He's not considerate of anyone.

75
00:04:31,514 --> 00:04:35,351
He's not the type to come in a good mood like this.

76
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:36,218
Oh gosh! Look!

77
00:04:36,218 --> 00:04:37,548
Look! He looks all happy!

78
00:04:38,793 --> 00:04:39,752
Nice shot Prem!

79
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:45,393
Maybe Mr. Jeng is in a good mood because he's soon
going to receive a position from the company president?

80
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:47,411
So he has nothing to worry about.

81
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:48,544
Wait.

82
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,055
Don't you remember? The President already
informed us in the beginning of the year.

83
00:04:52,694 --> 00:04:55,735
That he's going to be around for 2-3 more years.

84
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:58,653
Yeah, what do you mean by a new position?

85
00:04:58,653 --> 00:05:00,818
Or maybe Mr. Jeng is in love?

86
00:05:03,587 --> 00:05:05,832
I saw him at Khao Sarn road,

87
00:05:07,048 --> 00:05:09,844
but I don't know if he's there to go out drinking.

88
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:13,269
Hey!!

89
00:05:14,695 --> 00:05:18,042
Maybe he's buying prostitutes?

90
00:05:19,927 --> 00:05:22,723
But he's never been known
for being a ladies man.

91
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:26,776
What? Are you interested in gossip too?
Someone like you?

92
00:05:26,776 --> 00:05:31,072
If he's like that then,
we should have heard something a long time ago.

93
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,631
Why are you guys so bothered?

94
00:05:36,221 --> 00:05:37,180
Huh?

95
00:05:37,894 --> 00:05:38,853
About what?

96
00:05:38,853 --> 00:05:39,767
What if...

97
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:40,314
Huh?

98
00:05:41,084 --> 00:05:41,859
Huh?

99
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:43,816
What if Mr. Jeng is dying like in the movies!?

100
00:05:43,816 --> 00:05:46,363
I don't think so.

101
00:05:46,363 --> 00:05:49,535
I've seen his health record,

102
00:05:49,535 --> 00:05:51,206
his body is perfect.

103
00:05:53,234 --> 00:05:55,173
I think everyone is overthinking this.

104
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,931
Maybe he feels bad towards us
and wants to treat us better.

105
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:02,086
Really?

106
00:06:02,086 --> 00:06:02,586
Yes.

107
00:06:03,383 --> 00:06:04,709
You're so naive.

108
00:06:05,513 --> 00:06:07,513
Mark my words.

109
00:06:07,513 --> 00:06:11,564
Mr. Jeng is acting like the world's nicest boss,

110
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:15,920
to fool naive newbies like you!

111
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,652
So that you'll slave away.

112
00:06:17,652 --> 00:06:19,480
It's a trap.

113
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:25,081
Don't you know that,
people who keep secrets to themselves like that.

114
00:06:25,081 --> 00:06:27,243
Even up until now nobody has any idea,

115
00:06:27,243 --> 00:06:31,978
why 2 years ago Mr. Jeng suddenly quit.

116
00:06:33,147 --> 00:06:35,147
He's a mastermind planner.

117
00:06:35,147 --> 00:06:40,201
He may seem perfect but Mr. Jeng is only human.

118
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:43,671
No one is so perfect that they don't have flaws.

119
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,890
There's nothing going on.

120
00:06:46,481 --> 00:06:47,256
Right?

121
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,221
Yeah.

122
00:06:48,923 --> 00:06:50,200
Come on, let's stretch.

123
00:06:55,553 --> 00:06:56,512
Just a little bit.

124
00:06:57,144 --> 00:06:58,280
That's awesome.

125
00:06:58,566 --> 00:07:00,382
Will you go easy on me?

126
00:07:00,382 --> 00:07:02,431
Nope, I'm going for my revenge.

127
00:07:02,771 --> 00:07:03,914
Next time.

128
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:06,200
Change of plans.

129
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,103
Our chance of winning is really close.

130
00:07:08,103 --> 00:07:09,253
We see that.

131
00:07:09,253 --> 00:07:11,222
Right in front of us.

132
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:14,132
Pat, come and play.

133
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,823
It's your turn.

134
00:07:16,497 --> 00:07:16,997
Come on.

135
00:07:18,998 --> 00:07:19,528
Quickly.

136
00:07:24,283 --> 00:07:25,058
Quickly!

137
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:28,806
Go on! Go! Go on!

138
00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:47,268
Aren't you curious?

139
00:08:47,268 --> 00:08:51,300
What would make someone change themselves?

140
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,037
What made him change?

141
00:09:07,055 --> 00:09:08,200
Are you ok?

142
00:09:08,845 --> 00:09:09,498
I'm good.

143
00:09:13,771 --> 00:09:15,000
Focus.

144
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:53,793
Oh, my muscles are strained.

145
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,793
My back is in pain.

146
00:09:58,086 --> 00:09:59,160
Look at how you played!

147
00:10:01,907 --> 00:10:03,760
Why is Mr. Jeng without a drop of sweat?

148
00:10:04,335 --> 00:10:05,294
Even his hair is perfect.

149
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:07,800
Oh my...

150
00:10:08,271 --> 00:10:09,414
You're too strong.

151
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,038
Hey, don't gossip about the boss!

152
00:10:12,489 --> 00:10:15,400
Pat? Are you going with me?

153
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:16,600
Uh...

154
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,383
Did you forget that you have to go to
the auction event with me after this?

155
00:10:20,823 --> 00:10:22,440
Do you have to go shower and change at home?

156
00:10:22,885 --> 00:10:26,661
No, I didn't forget.
I'll just shower here and go.

157
00:10:29,177 --> 00:10:29,707
Ok.

158
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:34,240
Please excuse me.

159
00:10:35,031 --> 00:10:36,173
See you.

160
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:41,044
You're so cute!

161
00:10:43,592 --> 00:10:44,612
Your shoes are so cute!

162
00:10:48,912 --> 00:10:50,142
(Temporarily closed)

163
00:10:50,142 --> 00:10:54,000
Sorry, the lights bulb exploded
and we're waiting to fix it.

164
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:57,042
Oh no.

165
00:11:00,587 --> 00:11:02,954
It's ok, I can shower in the dark.

166
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:07,360
And the water pumps are broken,
water hardly comes out.

167
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:15,495
It's ok, I can shower with little water.

168
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:18,840
Hey!! Don't you understand? I said no!

169
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,401
Do you not understand what I'm saying?

170
00:11:26,474 --> 00:11:27,984
What's going on?

171
00:11:31,377 --> 00:11:34,160
What should we do Mr. Jeng?
We can't use the bathroom here.

172
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,369
There's no gym around here too.

173
00:11:36,664 --> 00:11:40,930
If I have to go all the way home to shower,
I won't make it on time.

174
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:45,521
You can go shower at my condo.

175
00:11:46,048 --> 00:11:46,701
Come on.

176
00:11:50,738 --> 00:11:52,187
- Sure.
- Let's go.

177
00:11:57,738 --> 00:11:59,738
I told you that I'm a big deal around here.

178
00:12:11,173 --> 00:12:12,377
Make yourself at home.

179
00:12:59,123 --> 00:13:01,520
You can go shower up stairs.

180
00:13:02,827 --> 00:13:03,360
Pat?

181
00:13:04,065 --> 00:13:04,565
Yes?

182
00:13:04,565 --> 00:13:07,160
You can go shower upstairs
or we won't make it on time.

183
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,520
Ok.

184
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:10,929
Make yourself at home.

185
00:15:13,047 --> 00:15:13,822
Mr. Jeng.

186
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:16,983
Mr. Jeng.

187
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:27,481
I'm ready.

188
00:15:35,907 --> 00:15:37,907
Let me go put away some stuff.

189
00:16:14,164 --> 00:16:15,490
I'm ready.

190
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:34,859
Ready.

191
00:16:34,859 --> 00:16:36,378
Shall we go?

192
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:37,809
Sure.

193
00:17:35,656 --> 00:17:37,350
That's kind of cute.

194
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,745
Yes, I'm Tootsie.

195
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,249
In fact...

196
00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:46,086
I'm also...

197
00:17:46,086 --> 00:17:46,636
Yes!

198
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,169
I know!

199
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:49,449
You're also gay.

200
00:17:49,843 --> 00:17:53,374
It's the word that you guys use to call someone
who is not very feminine right?

201
00:17:53,374 --> 00:17:54,223
Yes.

202
00:17:56,692 --> 00:17:58,692
Even though I'm very fem,

203
00:17:58,881 --> 00:18:00,881
but you're the first person who knows.

204
00:18:01,897 --> 00:18:03,223
And that Prem guy

205
00:18:03,581 --> 00:18:06,316
is always inviting me to hit on girls.

206
00:18:06,316 --> 00:18:07,620
Can't he see that I'm a tootsie??

207
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:12,332
If he invites me again,
I'll be screaming in his face.

208
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:17,908
So how was the auction event
you went with Mr. Jeng?

209
00:18:19,444 --> 00:18:20,342
It was fun.

210
00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:23,664
It was like I got to see another side to Mr. Jeng.

211
00:18:37,676 --> 00:18:41,881
It's like... we're from two different worlds.

212
00:18:43,232 --> 00:18:45,000
Or maybe a person like Mr. Jeng,

213
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,948
really has no flaws?

214
00:18:49,104 --> 00:18:50,124
Pat.

215
00:18:51,576 --> 00:18:53,025
Pat.

216
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:55,930
Pat!

217
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:56,430
Yes?

218
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,880
Mr. Jeng is coming over!

219
00:18:58,726 --> 00:19:00,000
Hello Mr. Jeng.

220
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,815
Hello.

221
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,805
When did you get here?

222
00:19:03,805 --> 00:19:05,600
Ever since you started singing.

223
00:19:09,767 --> 00:19:13,114
This is the second person of the day that knows.

224
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:18,080
Don't forget, 9 AM sharp, meeting in my office.

225
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:20,692
Ok.

226
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,204
Could I have some?

227
00:19:29,449 --> 00:19:30,341
Sure.

228
00:19:30,341 --> 00:19:30,841
Huh?

229
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:39,417
What about the campaign we presented?

230
00:19:41,484 --> 00:19:42,320
It's no good.

231
00:19:44,121 --> 00:19:46,121
Like I've told you before,

232
00:19:46,121 --> 00:19:49,987
the Digital Team is responsible
only for online content.

233
00:19:50,628 --> 00:19:54,159
What and when to post is enough,
don't think about the campaign.

234
00:19:56,621 --> 00:20:01,960
But my team has already told you,
all of the proposed plans are the ultimate plans.

235
00:20:02,686 --> 00:20:06,040
Actually, this is a great place
for online campaigns, unlike TVC.

236
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,359
We intend to bring together
a new generation of audience.

237
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,680
Well, it's too bad that you suck,
I tried to help you.

238
00:20:14,466 --> 00:20:15,425
Right.

239
00:20:16,085 --> 00:20:18,024
But I didn't think they would clash like this.

240
00:20:18,024 --> 00:20:19,166
That's harsh.

241
00:20:20,551 --> 00:20:22,551
I saw that on the Marcom side,

242
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,724
they already proposed to Nadia
but it did not pass.

243
00:20:26,217 --> 00:20:28,440
So my side, came to help brainstorm.

244
00:20:28,797 --> 00:20:33,247
I'd like you to come over and hear from my team in detail.
In case you can see the bigger picture.

245
00:20:35,882 --> 00:20:37,698
If you want to update this part, it's okay.

246
00:20:38,983 --> 00:20:40,371
I saw the slides.

247
00:20:41,145 --> 00:20:43,084
It's not even in the lines of the brief.

248
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,817
How is it not?

249
00:20:47,286 --> 00:20:52,760
The brief was to come up with
Lively+'s Digital Marketing strategy, isn't it?

250
00:20:54,841 --> 00:20:57,120
Not directly for digital marketing.

251
00:20:58,827 --> 00:21:01,194
It's not an online campaign like you said.

252
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:03,567
But online campaigns are digital marketing.

253
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:12,203
I think it's better for Nadia to decide.

254
00:21:34,116 --> 00:21:36,605
It's okay.

255
00:21:40,027 --> 00:21:43,007
But yeah, look at it from over there.

256
00:21:46,088 --> 00:21:49,075
He must be really dissatisfied
that we interfered with his work.

257
00:21:49,636 --> 00:21:51,207
I'm also upset

258
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,960
that Mr. Jeng tried to sell the project
even though it's still incomplete.

259
00:21:56,002 --> 00:21:57,400
He hasn't changed at all.

260
00:21:58,441 --> 00:22:00,441
He fooled us,

261
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:03,248
like Ying said.

262
00:22:03,248 --> 00:22:07,759
Like when Mr. Jeng acted nice towards me,

263
00:22:08,738 --> 00:22:10,677
but in the end it's the same.

264
00:22:15,206 --> 00:22:16,360
Do you want some?

265
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,680
Should I?

266
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,379
It's better than being hungry.

267
00:22:24,137 --> 00:22:26,880
After eating, please give me a review.

268
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,459
I want to know your opinion.

269
00:22:29,988 --> 00:22:31,988
Then I'm not going to hold back.

270
00:22:31,988 --> 00:22:33,437
Go ahead.

271
00:22:44,017 --> 00:22:45,000
It's good!

272
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,920
It's crispy and tingling like Japanese wasabi.

273
00:22:53,764 --> 00:22:55,360
Is it that serious?

274
00:22:57,561 --> 00:22:59,561
Well, you told me to review it.

275
00:23:06,644 --> 00:23:08,032
I can't stop eating it.

276
00:23:10,035 --> 00:23:11,606
Then I'm giving you this pack.

277
00:23:19,474 --> 00:23:20,862
So how are you?

278
00:23:20,862 --> 00:23:22,495
Is work hard?

279
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:26,880
It's been pretty tough.

280
00:23:27,535 --> 00:23:29,413
I've been working for two months,

281
00:23:29,413 --> 00:23:31,919
and I have no work life balance.

282
00:23:33,391 --> 00:23:34,962
Work life balance?

283
00:23:35,978 --> 00:23:39,920
I think in this day and age,
we should follow the Work Life Integration concept.

284
00:23:40,328 --> 00:23:43,369
I believe that work is a part of life.

285
00:23:44,461 --> 00:23:45,297
Yes,

286
00:23:45,911 --> 00:23:50,545
but Jian Group's system doesn't really support
the Work Life Integration concept.

287
00:23:50,545 --> 00:23:55,280
We start at 9 AM and get off work at 5 PM,
how can we work with the Work Life Integration concept.

288
00:23:56,427 --> 00:23:57,998
I want to change it,

289
00:23:57,998 --> 00:24:01,001
but it's difficult, it's a big organization.

290
00:24:02,211 --> 00:24:02,711
Sure.

291
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:07,881
Even on Saturdays and Sundays,
I don't get to rest.

292
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,600
Is it because you're not good at your job and slow

293
00:24:12,876 --> 00:24:15,560
so you have to work at home?

294
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,290
So you don't have balance in life.

295
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:21,481
I think blaming only the system is unfair.

296
00:24:26,686 --> 00:24:28,686
Sometimes the work is ordered on Friday
and is expected to be finished on Monday morning,

297
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:32,863
sometimes it's ordered at night
and expected in the morning.

298
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,634
I don't know how to balance it.

299
00:24:36,452 --> 00:24:39,126
This is a totally different situation
from being a slow worker.

300
00:24:39,126 --> 00:24:42,972
I think you should stand your ground,

301
00:24:42,972 --> 00:24:47,331
or people will see you as weak.

302
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:50,040
I'm telling you this
because I mean the best for you.

303
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,480
I think you should speak up for yourself
more than this.

304
00:24:53,914 --> 00:24:55,160
Could you park?

305
00:24:57,715 --> 00:24:58,368
But I think it's still...

306
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,358
Here!

307
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:02,191
You're speaking up for yourself.

308
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:40,494
Come on, it's fine.

309
00:25:53,357 --> 00:25:54,320
Hello Pat.

310
00:25:55,046 --> 00:25:56,127
Is that Pat?

311
00:25:56,411 --> 00:25:57,982
Put?

312
00:25:58,801 --> 00:25:59,301
Hello?

313
00:26:00,823 --> 00:26:01,323
Pat...

314
00:26:02,199 --> 00:26:03,954
I know you can hear me.

315
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:06,757
What's wrong?

316
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,955
Nothing, I'm just a bit tired.

317
00:26:12,678 --> 00:26:16,393
Ah, go sit and get some rest.
I'm going now.

318
00:26:27,293 --> 00:26:28,252
Ae?

319
00:27:25,816 --> 00:27:26,959
Jaab...

320
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,746
Jaab!

321
00:27:34,423 --> 00:27:35,480
Hey, Jaab!

322
00:27:38,024 --> 00:27:39,779
Did you have to be that startled?

323
00:27:42,969 --> 00:27:44,160
What's wrong?

324
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:48,040
I'm a bit confused with this.

325
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,913
The scene where the heroine says this,
what does it mean?

326
00:27:53,253 --> 00:27:56,295
If it's this sentence with this...

327
00:27:56,727 --> 00:27:58,080
Um...

328
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,713
I might mean this or do we have to swap it?

329
00:28:02,267 --> 00:28:03,777
What does it mean?

330
00:28:04,241 --> 00:28:05,506
What should we do?

331
00:28:46,876 --> 00:28:48,876
Hey, Jaab! What is this?

332
00:28:50,928 --> 00:28:51,840
Hey!

333
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:56,529
Hey, Jen.

334
00:28:57,975 --> 00:28:58,960
Jaab!

335
00:29:02,214 --> 00:29:04,030
It's not coming off!

336
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,326
Let me help you.

337
00:29:18,109 --> 00:29:19,864
Why are you laughing?

338
00:29:22,772 --> 00:29:25,200
Why are you using a marker on my forehead?

339
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:27,641
I know you're trying to prank me.

340
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,081
Are you crazy?

341
00:29:29,081 --> 00:29:33,521
Why would someone suddenly draw on someone's forehead?

342
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,314
Did someone draw on someone's forehead?

343
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:41,316
Jaab did!

344
00:29:44,131 --> 00:29:46,437
I told you it wasn't a prank!

345
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,669
I just wanted to flick Jen's hair out of the way.

346
00:29:51,213 --> 00:29:53,213
Look, it's bothering Jen's sight.

347
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:54,272
Let me help.

348
00:29:54,272 --> 00:29:55,666
Come on, let me help.

349
00:29:56,155 --> 00:29:58,706
You're always brushing my hair.

350
00:29:58,706 --> 00:30:00,041
Is it in my eyes or something?

351
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:03,761
Let me ask you, how is my hair bothering you?

352
00:30:04,782 --> 00:30:07,149
Yeah, it's bothering me
because I'm always looking at it.

353
00:30:27,844 --> 00:30:29,109
Come on, let me help.

354
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,799
It comes off.

355
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,160
Yeah.

356
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,311
Come on, let me help take it off.

357
00:30:52,537 --> 00:30:53,880
Take that!

358
00:30:55,201 --> 00:30:56,440
How's that?

359
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:58,477
How could you do that?

360
00:31:02,336 --> 00:31:05,438
Could you help with the clothes?
I have to go out to see the client soon.

361
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,240
I'm sorry.

362
00:31:10,012 --> 00:31:11,318
It's all red.

363
00:31:11,318 --> 00:31:12,889
Take that!

364
00:31:12,889 --> 00:31:14,182
Why would you do that again?

365
00:31:14,182 --> 00:31:15,425
Let's just call it even.

366
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:55,480
Oh no.

367
00:32:01,147 --> 00:32:02,412
What are you smiling about?

368
00:32:04,179 --> 00:32:05,440
It's not what you think!

369
00:32:05,845 --> 00:32:07,845
What do you expect me to think?

370
00:32:09,445 --> 00:32:10,920
I think that...

371
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:13,529
You've been around for a whole year before them,

372
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:18,200
and then they just swoop in in front of you.

373
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,645
I hate you! I hate you so much.

374
00:32:22,645 --> 00:32:23,964
Don't tell anyone!

375
00:32:25,505 --> 00:32:26,480
Promise!?

376
00:32:27,262 --> 00:32:29,694
Fine, fine!

377
00:32:33,361 --> 00:32:37,198
Buy me food and be my slave for one year.

378
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:38,608
Deal!

379
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,254
Is this what you want?

380
00:32:50,254 --> 00:32:51,748
Fine, then I'll tell other people.

381
00:32:52,115 --> 00:32:53,196
Oh my...

382
00:32:53,441 --> 00:32:55,747
Don't come any closer!

383
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,360
Promise me first.

384
00:32:59,131 --> 00:33:00,000
Quickly!

385
00:33:02,634 --> 00:33:03,926
Quickly!

386
00:33:03,926 --> 00:33:05,240
What the...

387
00:33:06,032 --> 00:33:07,420
Quickly!

388
00:33:07,933 --> 00:33:09,933
Yeah, that's more like it.

389
00:33:15,979 --> 00:33:18,775
Pat... I'm sorry.

390
00:33:18,775 --> 00:33:25,240
Well, Put threatened me that if I didn't give him your number,
he wouldn't hire me to continue his project.

391
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:29,472
But I didn't tell the story of you
coming back to him, I keep my mouth shut.

392
00:33:31,201 --> 00:33:34,760
If you say more than this then,
I won't be coming to see you either.

393
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,594
No, I haven't told him anything else,
I just gave him your number number.

394
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:45,000
But Put... Why is he so stuck on you?
Anyway, I think you should clear things up.

395
00:33:46,198 --> 00:33:48,994
Or do you want to eat something else?

396
00:33:49,793 --> 00:33:55,835
Tell me what you want to eat,
I'll take care of you myself.

397
00:33:56,693 --> 00:33:58,754
Let me see, where did my phone go?

398
00:34:06,857 --> 00:34:09,776
Hey, why did you buy a maternity test?

399
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,070
My period hasn't come for two months.

400
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:15,318
But I haven't checked yet,
I'm still taking my time.

401
00:34:16,146 --> 00:34:18,636
What if you're pregnant?
Have you told Kanun?

402
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:22,555
If I'm pregnant, then I'll tell him
and we might even get married.

403
00:34:23,582 --> 00:34:24,970
Is he going to stick around?

404
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:27,963
Oh, I don't think he'll have the guts to dump me,
I know too many of his secrets.

405
00:34:27,963 --> 00:34:29,468
I'll tell the world if he dumps me.

406
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:31,329
You're scary.

407
00:34:31,329 --> 00:34:32,100
Of course.

408
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:35,815
Who are you going to tell the world about?

409
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:40,379
Ah, here.

410
00:34:41,895 --> 00:34:43,528
It looks so good!

411
00:34:44,241 --> 00:34:47,160
I saw that you guys seem to be in pretty serious
conversation, so I didn't want to bother you.

412
00:34:52,733 --> 00:34:55,440
Hey, don't worry. Jeng is not coming in today.

413
00:34:55,888 --> 00:34:57,398
Oh, ok.

414
00:34:57,398 --> 00:35:03,118
Pat, the chef at the party
the other day was your boss?

415
00:35:03,522 --> 00:35:05,154
He's so freaking handsome.

416
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:09,089
When you first told me,
I thought he was some boring middle aged loser.

417
00:35:09,089 --> 00:35:12,927
But he's the opposite of that, he's handsome and nice!

418
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:16,908
He even said he'd change for you! Pat!

419
00:35:17,276 --> 00:35:19,675
Are people really that capable of change?

420
00:35:19,675 --> 00:35:22,107
Ah, I'm all for pretty privilege!

421
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,161
Did Jeng tell you that?

422
00:35:27,468 --> 00:35:31,000
Ah, but as boss and underling.

423
00:35:35,377 --> 00:35:37,840
But he returned to his normal self today!

424
00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:41,544
Controling and he doesn't trust anyone with his work.

425
00:35:43,156 --> 00:35:45,340
That's how he is.

426
00:35:45,864 --> 00:35:48,960
So what is Mr. Jeng really like?

427
00:35:49,389 --> 00:35:51,448
Well... Um...

428
00:35:51,738 --> 00:35:56,372
I think he's acting a bit strange nowadays.

429
00:35:56,762 --> 00:36:02,620
He asked me if he had any negative traits,
it's as if he was told by someone.

430
00:36:05,356 --> 00:36:07,050
Oh...

431
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:12,726
Well, if you look beyond him as a control freak,
he's a good looking guy.

432
00:36:12,982 --> 00:36:14,982
Rich family and good manners.

433
00:36:15,287 --> 00:36:17,838
Never any bad rumours.

434
00:36:18,596 --> 00:36:21,208
Considered to be a perfect person.

435
00:36:22,245 --> 00:36:26,600
What about the story
that he left the Jian group 2 years ago?

436
00:36:27,794 --> 00:36:32,244
I don't know about that
because Jeng never told me about it.

437
00:36:32,534 --> 00:36:35,480
All I know is he's not been on good terms
with his dad for a long time.

438
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,680
Maybe it's probably because he is eldest son?

439
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,907
So a lot is expected of him
to be perfect role model.

440
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:48,348
Or does he want to cover up his weaknesses?

441
00:36:49,128 --> 00:36:52,400
Like not wanting anyone to know,
because he'll be at an advantage.

442
00:36:52,927 --> 00:36:54,682
Like how I know stuff about Kanun.

443
00:36:54,682 --> 00:36:57,896
I squeeze and he'd die in my hands.
Loosen my grip? No way!

444
00:36:59,044 --> 00:37:00,000
Go head on.

445
00:37:00,455 --> 00:37:01,108
I'll do it for you.

446
00:37:01,108 --> 00:37:02,027
You're scary.

447
00:37:02,027 --> 00:37:02,759
Of course.

448
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:09,560
This is our restaurant's special menu,
try tasting it.

449
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,935
Well, I have to try it now.

450
00:37:14,055 --> 00:37:15,749
How is it?

451
00:37:15,749 --> 00:37:17,801
Hmm! I just tasted it but it's so good!

452
00:37:43,792 --> 00:37:45,792
Is this Mr. Jeng's weak spot?

453
00:37:49,292 --> 00:37:53,292
(Kittipong's weaknesses)

454
00:38:00,292 --> 00:38:04,092
(Kittipong)

455
00:38:04,528 --> 00:38:07,447
It's the secret to success!

456
00:38:08,183 --> 00:38:09,693
Mr. Kittipong.

457
00:38:10,345 --> 00:38:10,845
Huh?

458
00:38:11,343 --> 00:38:17,814
The hottest heir of the Attarajiranon Family.

459
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:18,869
Huh?

460
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,545
Why are there only good things?

461
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:44,320
He's not even on social media.

462
00:38:44,623 --> 00:38:46,256
Why is he so mysterious.

463
00:38:46,735 --> 00:38:48,080
He's like an old guy.

464
00:38:49,003 --> 00:38:51,370
How is he head of Digital Marketing?

465
00:39:09,231 --> 00:39:10,120
Mr. Jeng,

466
00:39:10,664 --> 00:39:12,280
I need your advice on something.

467
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,241
It's about the next Forge project.

468
00:39:14,731 --> 00:39:18,262
I'm sorry,
I'm actually on my way to a meeting outside.

469
00:39:18,262 --> 00:39:21,721
But email me and we'll talk out the details later.

470
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,762
Are you coming back
into the office again today?

471
00:39:25,459 --> 00:39:29,174
I don't think so,
but I'll set up at meeting.

472
00:39:29,514 --> 00:39:30,718
Oh, ok.

473
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,081
I'm going now.

474
00:39:49,774 --> 00:39:52,203
Oh my gosh! There's Patonggoh!

475
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:02,040
Sis!

476
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,324
Huh?

477
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:09,640
Do you remember when I told you that,
I saw Mr. Jeng at Khao sarn road?

478
00:40:10,071 --> 00:40:11,254
When?

479
00:40:13,042 --> 00:40:14,400
On that day!

480
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,156
That day that you told us.

481
00:40:17,156 --> 00:40:18,774
Yes, on that day.

482
00:40:18,774 --> 00:40:20,181
Well? What's up?

483
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:21,621
Hello, hey.

484
00:40:23,397 --> 00:40:25,397
I didn't mean to overhear,

485
00:40:25,397 --> 00:40:28,112
but if you want to ask something, just ask me.

486
00:40:29,533 --> 00:40:30,308
For real?

487
00:40:30,308 --> 00:40:31,100
Of course!

488
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,566
Good! Because I'm so confused!

489
00:40:34,441 --> 00:40:35,400
That back then.

490
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:35,900
Ah huh...

491
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,847
Two years ago...

492
00:40:36,847 --> 00:40:37,585
Ah...

493
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,760
Why did Mr. Jeng leave the company?

494
00:40:41,143 --> 00:40:44,160
Ah, you're curious about that?

495
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,001
Yep.

496
00:40:45,001 --> 00:40:45,926
Hold on.

497
00:40:49,469 --> 00:40:50,880
Honestly,

498
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,870
we're also curious
because our department was doing very well,

499
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:57,446
and suddenly Mr. Jeng just dipped.

500
00:40:57,446 --> 00:41:00,053
We tried to analyze after Mr. Jeng left.

501
00:41:00,053 --> 00:41:00,865
Um...

502
00:41:00,865 --> 00:41:06,346
We tried to analyze after Mr. Jeng left,

503
00:41:06,346 --> 00:41:10,998
I think he left to take over the position of President.

504
00:41:11,531 --> 00:41:16,920
From that day until now,
we still have the same president,

505
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,008
it's wrong analysis.

506
00:41:19,454 --> 00:41:21,600
So I don't know, it's still a mystery.

507
00:41:22,252 --> 00:41:23,150
And?

508
00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:24,499
Huh?

509
00:41:24,499 --> 00:41:28,090
Has Mr. Jeng done any weird things in the past?

510
00:41:30,001 --> 00:41:31,389
Or is there something strange?

511
00:41:33,628 --> 00:41:34,281
Weird?

512
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,075
Hmm...

513
00:41:38,507 --> 00:41:41,671
That is the weirdest thing I ever know.

514
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,314
It's true!

515
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,517
Can you imagine?

516
00:41:47,517 --> 00:41:51,232
Ying, me and Pat will head back to work first.

517
00:41:51,232 --> 00:41:51,732
What?

518
00:41:51,732 --> 00:41:52,453
Come on, go quickly!

519
00:41:52,453 --> 00:41:53,455
No, I'm going to tell you the story.

520
00:41:54,658 --> 00:41:55,403
Now...

521
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:04,870
Hey.

522
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:08,560
What were you thinking asking Ying like that?

523
00:42:11,511 --> 00:42:14,000
I'm trying to find Mr. Jeng's weak spots.

524
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,588
Hey!

525
00:42:16,629 --> 00:42:21,360
I found the nail polish and,
women's shampoo soap at Mr. Jeng's condo.

526
00:42:22,267 --> 00:42:26,120
You told me that Mr. Jeng has never had a girlfriend.

527
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,210
I think he's...

528
00:42:30,643 --> 00:42:32,092
hiding a girl.

529
00:42:32,092 --> 00:42:34,351
Oh my gosh, I'll hit you.

530
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:36,444
I'm sorry Chot.

531
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,615
I know what I'm suspicious of
is none of my business.

532
00:42:39,615 --> 00:42:42,163
But Mr. Jeng sometimes is nice and sometimes he's horrible.

533
00:42:43,192 --> 00:42:44,760
I don't know how to handle that.

534
00:42:45,001 --> 00:42:47,736
But if I can know Mr. Jeng's weaknesses,

535
00:42:47,736 --> 00:42:51,032
I can use that to negotiate
when he over bullies me?

536
00:42:51,032 --> 00:42:51,872
Bullies?

537
00:42:51,872 --> 00:42:53,000
What did he do to you ?

538
00:42:54,459 --> 00:42:57,720
Well, at the last Forge presentation.

539
00:43:01,627 --> 00:43:04,178
If you're afraid of being bullied,
why don't you speak to him directly?

540
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:08,910
Well, Mr. Jeng keeps repeating the same mistakes.

541
00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:11,913
And he said he'd changed.

542
00:43:12,342 --> 00:43:13,680
But...

543
00:43:15,461 --> 00:43:16,760
Can I say it?

544
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,575
What makes you think you can't?

545
00:43:19,693 --> 00:43:22,244
So does this mean you don't believe it,
when he says he's changed?

546
00:43:25,423 --> 00:43:27,720
Well from what you see,
has he really changed?

547
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:31,435
Even if he hasn't, he's not in the wrong,
because it's his personal business.

548
00:43:40,376 --> 00:43:41,886
Or do you have a crush on him?

549
00:43:41,886 --> 00:43:44,285
No, it's not like that!

550
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,807
Sure.

551
00:43:46,807 --> 00:43:47,916
Ok.

552
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:51,587
Let me go to the bathroom for a moment,
and wait for me in the conference room.

553
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,309
Pat, come here.

554
00:43:54,957 --> 00:43:56,406
Lock it too!

555
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,560
Be quiet.

556
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:12,130
Mr. Jeng is taking a piss.

557
00:44:28,191 --> 00:44:29,640
Hello.

558
00:44:32,207 --> 00:44:33,350
Of course.

559
00:44:34,746 --> 00:44:36,320
See you on Sunday afternoon, right?

560
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,410
Who is it, why is he being so sweet?

561
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:39,480
I don't know.

562
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,037
I'm having the exact same thought.

563
00:44:56,597 --> 00:44:57,440
Who is that?

564
00:45:03,137 --> 00:45:03,912
Pat?

565
00:45:06,841 --> 00:45:08,080
Is it Pat?

566
00:45:11,203 --> 00:45:13,265
Mr. Jeng, there will be another meeting in 10 minutes.

567
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:16,870
Yes, I'm leaving now.

568
00:45:34,302 --> 00:45:36,302
We were almost done for.

569
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,144
I told you to be quiet!

570
00:45:45,691 --> 00:45:48,303
Even though I love other people's business but...

571
00:45:48,591 --> 00:45:49,489
I have to warn you!

572
00:45:49,489 --> 00:45:51,965
Ok, Chot.

573
00:45:53,144 --> 00:45:55,040
I won't do it again.

574
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,868
I'm so proud of you.

575
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:07,665
I have to apologize in advance,

576
00:46:07,665 --> 00:46:10,076
but I'm only free to talk to you this Sunday.

577
00:46:10,076 --> 00:46:12,806
Could you come to my condo to talk?

578
00:46:12,806 --> 00:46:15,698
You've been there before,
I'm sure you know where it is.

579
00:46:15,698 --> 00:46:16,662
Chot.

580
00:46:21,505 --> 00:46:25,097
Did Mr. Jeng just say Sunday?

581
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:56,270
What if he overheard what we spoke about?
We'd be fired!

582
00:46:56,270 --> 00:47:00,790
Just get it over with a leave quickly,
do you understand?

583
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:43,604
That's great.

584
00:47:45,391 --> 00:47:46,595
I'm ok now.

585
00:47:48,443 --> 00:47:49,218
Yes!

586
00:47:53,601 --> 00:47:56,920
If that's all for you, excuse me.

587
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,599
Have a meal with me before you go, please.

588
00:47:59,474 --> 00:48:01,045
I've ordered something for you, too.

589
00:48:01,401 --> 00:48:02,482
No, thanks.

590
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:05,520
Hey, here it comes.

591
00:48:07,941 --> 00:48:10,186
Hold on. Let's eat something together.

592
00:48:16,529 --> 00:48:20,680
Hey, why didn't you call me
so I could've gone down to see you?

593
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,261
I really missed you, my girl.

594
00:48:23,382 --> 00:48:25,443
Excuse me, Mr. Jeng. Goodbye.

595
00:48:25,804 --> 00:48:27,498
Is this your friend, Uncle?

596
00:48:28,718 --> 00:48:29,677
Yes, he is.

597
00:48:37,377 --> 00:48:39,132
You just ran here without waiting for me.

598
00:48:40,342 --> 00:48:44,302
Well, Mr. Jeng, your sister has some errands to run,

599
00:48:44,302 --> 00:48:47,315
so she had me take Jaew upstairs to you instead.

600
00:48:48,074 --> 00:48:50,564
All right. Thank you so much, Prae.

601
00:48:51,112 --> 00:48:52,561
Take care of her, please.

602
00:48:52,561 --> 00:48:53,151
Ok.

603
00:48:56,599 --> 00:48:58,400
Who are you, Uncle?

604
00:49:00,411 --> 00:49:01,451
Uncle?!

605
00:49:02,104 --> 00:49:04,600
This is Pat. Call him brother, ok?

606
00:49:04,933 --> 00:49:06,382
Say hello to him.

607
00:49:06,382 --> 00:49:07,298
Hello.

608
00:49:07,298 --> 00:49:08,521
Well, hello.

609
00:49:23,263 --> 00:49:26,304
Can I have some desserts outside
like I could last week?

610
00:49:27,761 --> 00:49:29,577
This week you can't.

611
00:49:29,577 --> 00:49:31,896
Look. Uncle has a guest here.

612
00:49:37,105 --> 00:49:41,432
But today we'll be having a meal at home.
Good, right?

613
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:42,843
Good, good.

614
00:49:43,328 --> 00:49:44,800
Invite him for the meal with us, too.

615
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,600
Pat, let's have a meal together.

616
00:49:49,721 --> 00:49:50,496
Please.

617
00:49:57,991 --> 00:49:59,624
Can I see your nails?

618
00:50:00,271 --> 00:50:01,352
Has the nail polish gone?

619
00:50:01,352 --> 00:50:02,118
Yes, it has.

620
00:50:02,118 --> 00:50:03,281
So will you have it repainted today?

621
00:50:03,281 --> 00:50:03,976
Yes, I will.

622
00:50:06,595 --> 00:50:10,616
You forgot your nail polish at my place.
Bring it back today, ok?

623
00:50:10,616 --> 00:50:11,139
Ok.

624
00:50:13,483 --> 00:50:15,483
This side, please.

625
00:50:16,441 --> 00:50:17,461
Do you want me to do it for you now?

626
00:50:17,461 --> 00:50:18,069
Yes, please.

627
00:50:18,069 --> 00:50:18,816
Right now?

628
00:50:18,816 --> 00:50:19,581
Yes, please.

629
00:50:19,581 --> 00:50:20,585
Which fingers for today?

630
00:50:20,585 --> 00:50:22,000
My thumb first.

631
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,834
It's all gone now.

632
00:50:23,834 --> 00:50:24,900
Ok.

633
00:50:30,309 --> 00:50:34,514
Yeah! We've got it! All my nails have the colour now.

634
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:36,491
What's next?

635
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:38,419
The index finger.

636
00:50:44,849 --> 00:50:46,320
Aren't you in a hurry now?

637
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:49,790
Yes, but after I put away the dishes.

638
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:55,684
Thank you for recommending badminton to me.

639
00:51:01,127 --> 00:51:03,678
You just invited everyone
to play golf together like that.

640
00:51:04,424 --> 00:51:06,118
That's why they were all confused.

641
00:51:06,892 --> 00:51:10,239
That's right.
There're so many things I've got to learn.

642
00:51:11,888 --> 00:51:13,888
I wish I were getting closer to the team.

643
00:51:13,888 --> 00:51:18,497
If you have any ideas, please feel free to suggest me.

644
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:27,800
Can I say something?

645
00:51:28,386 --> 00:51:29,000
Of course.

646
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,363
I told you I am trying to change myself.

647
00:51:38,754 --> 00:51:40,019
You don't believe me, Pat?

648
00:51:42,282 --> 00:51:43,363
No, I don't.

649
00:51:44,417 --> 00:51:45,805
Well, I...

650
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:50,336
The previous presentation about Forge...

651
00:51:50,336 --> 00:51:52,134
Uncle Jeng!

652
00:51:52,416 --> 00:51:55,720
Yes. I'm putting away the dishes.
Then, I'll see you up there.

653
00:51:56,142 --> 00:51:57,320
What did you say, Pat?

654
00:51:57,837 --> 00:52:00,266
Oh, nothing.

655
00:52:00,779 --> 00:52:03,960
You can excuse yourself,
and I'll be doing it on my own.

656
00:52:04,992 --> 00:52:06,992
So excuse me.

657
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:52,690
Oh gosh!

658
00:52:54,282 --> 00:52:57,017
When your boss spots you on Social Media.

659
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,820
What on earth is this?

660
00:53:29,473 --> 00:53:31,120
Mr. Toh said Mr. Jeng did it.

661
00:53:31,403 --> 00:53:33,960
He wants to build up intimacy among us.

662
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:41,674
How to use: Write some words of encouragement
for anyone who you want to communicate with,

663
00:53:41,674 --> 00:53:43,434
photos of whom are attached to the board.

664
00:53:44,249 --> 00:53:48,480
Whoa! Mr. Chot, look at my face! How fat!

665
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,840
No! Look at Ying's face.
It's as wrinkled as soil cracking.

666
00:53:52,355 --> 00:53:54,840
Don't be too harsh. They'll hear us all.

667
00:53:56,172 --> 00:53:58,920
This is a nice idea, anyway.

668
00:53:59,327 --> 00:54:02,160
Or it's true that Mr. Jeng wants to change himself?

669
00:54:03,481 --> 00:54:04,991
Right, Mr. Jeng.

670
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:12,353
Oops. I gotta work, or I'll be chewed out.

671
00:54:12,353 --> 00:54:13,201
Yeah, Mr. Chot.

672
00:54:29,301 --> 00:54:39,301
(Let's play tennis next time.)

673
00:54:40,917 --> 00:54:42,960
How do you see the font, Mr. Jeng?

674
00:54:43,415 --> 00:54:45,000
I think it needs to be changed.

675
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,161
This one doesn't look quite formal.

676
00:54:47,161 --> 00:54:54,395
And it'll be better if you move the logo
to the right a little, so we can get this keyword here.

677
00:54:54,395 --> 00:54:55,460
You get it, right?

678
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,448
Yes, I do.

679
00:54:57,310 --> 00:54:58,575
Do you want to see the SWOT?

680
00:54:58,575 --> 00:54:59,881
Yes, please. Let's see it.

681
00:55:00,861 --> 00:55:01,881
It's ok.

682
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:03,647
I think the content is good,

683
00:55:03,647 --> 00:55:06,759
but please change the font
and make it look clearer.

684
00:55:06,759 --> 00:55:10,511
By the way, use the first slide's background
for the entire presentation.

685
00:55:11,365 --> 00:55:12,446
Ok.

686
00:55:17,932 --> 00:55:19,626
Can I make a phone call for a while?

687
00:55:19,626 --> 00:55:20,461
Yes, you can.

688
00:55:24,366 --> 00:55:25,141
Hello.

689
00:55:28,032 --> 00:55:28,562
Yes.

690
00:55:29,616 --> 00:55:30,640
What would you like?

691
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,800
Ok. I'll buy it for you.

692
00:55:35,122 --> 00:55:36,840
Ok. Ok.

693
00:55:37,207 --> 00:55:37,707
Good bye.

694
00:55:43,517 --> 00:55:45,517
Pat, can I go out for a while?

695
00:55:45,517 --> 00:55:46,992
Well, would you like anything?

696
00:55:46,992 --> 00:55:48,214
No, thanks.

697
00:55:48,214 --> 00:55:50,249
I'll keep on working, then.

698
00:55:50,775 --> 00:55:51,611
I'll be right back.

699
00:55:51,611 --> 00:55:52,308
Yeah.

700
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:10,666
Woah! That's enough, Krit?

701
00:56:11,363 --> 00:56:15,384
Ummm... I think i've got what I wanted all.

702
00:56:15,384 --> 00:56:17,167
It's supposed to be like that, isn't it?
There's a lot.

703
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:17,670
Right.

704
00:56:18,507 --> 00:56:19,650
Oh, hold on.

705
00:56:23,674 --> 00:56:27,083
Sis, Mr. Jeng has just walked out of
a women's handbag shop.

706
00:56:28,121 --> 00:56:30,121
It's not for his niece for sure!

707
00:56:31,486 --> 00:56:32,384
Oohhh!

708
00:56:35,082 --> 00:56:36,163
Oohhh!

709
00:56:40,052 --> 00:56:41,011
Pat!

710
00:56:41,821 --> 00:56:44,600
Delete it now! This is the Forge chat group!

711
00:56:45,536 --> 00:56:46,740
OMG!

712
00:56:46,916 --> 00:56:47,691
That's true!

713
00:56:47,691 --> 00:56:49,429
Get it done right now!

714
00:56:50,655 --> 00:56:53,512
Sis, Mr. Jeng has replied!

715
00:56:53,512 --> 00:56:54,844
Wait. Hold on.

716
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:01,057
(Jeng: Aren't you getting home, Pat?
Could you see me at my office?)

717
00:57:03,411 --> 00:57:06,514
He's gonna get you!
Deal with it now! That's all!

718
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:12,120
Urgh! You're so busted!
What the hell have you done?

719
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,195
What happened?

720
00:57:14,579 --> 00:57:19,458
My co-worker gossiped about our boss
in the chat group.

721
00:57:19,458 --> 00:57:20,747
How bad!

722
00:57:20,747 --> 00:57:21,922
He's really busted.

723
00:57:22,419 --> 00:57:22,919
Right.

724
00:57:23,042 --> 00:57:26,818
But, this co-worker of yours...
is like you in a way, Chot.

725
00:57:28,792 --> 00:57:30,792
Krit, you're crazy!

726
00:57:30,792 --> 00:57:31,884
I was kidding.

727
00:58:06,307 --> 00:58:07,756
Excuse me.

728
00:58:08,531 --> 00:58:09,640
Take a seat.

729
00:58:23,843 --> 00:58:26,800
What it is that you asked for me?

730
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:31,029
If it's about...

731
00:58:31,378 --> 00:58:34,840
Well, I have wondered for a while,

732
00:58:35,413 --> 00:58:38,960
why you are paying special attention to me
at this time.

733
00:58:42,369 --> 00:58:45,000
Have I done something that makes you feel bad?

734
00:58:45,286 --> 00:58:46,612
No. Not at all.

735
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:50,597
Well, I don't...

736
00:58:56,328 --> 00:59:00,000
Can I be frank with you, Mr. Jeng?

737
00:59:01,469 --> 00:59:02,612
Certainly.

738
00:59:06,435 --> 00:59:09,292
So I'll telling you that,

739
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,760
I'm really mad at you.

740
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,840
You did the same thing again.

741
00:59:16,454 --> 00:59:19,311
You talked about my project to someone else
without having consulted me first.

742
00:59:21,179 --> 00:59:24,760
I understand that you wanted to protect our team,

743
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,347
but those ideas weren't yet complete.

744
00:59:27,347 --> 00:59:30,281
With such weaknesses,
we shouldn't have done the presentation like that.

745
00:59:32,481 --> 00:59:38,462
That's why I need to identify your weaknesses,
so I can protect myself,

746
00:59:40,232 --> 00:59:42,783
when you do this to me again.

747
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:44,551
And have you seen them?

748
00:59:45,809 --> 00:59:47,135
My weaknesses?

749
00:59:52,832 --> 00:59:54,220
No, I haven't.

750
00:59:55,844 --> 00:59:58,720
You're way too perfect.

751
01:00:03,036 --> 01:00:05,720
I didn't mean to present your work in itself.

752
01:00:07,019 --> 01:00:08,345
Actually, I see that,

753
01:00:09,076 --> 01:00:12,680
it has a great deal of potential.

754
01:00:13,208 --> 01:00:16,680
And when we'll be having a chance to do
the pitching to Nadia in such a big conference,

755
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:19,462
I intend to have you do it all yourself.

756
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:25,680
I'm sorry for making you feel bad.

757
01:00:27,483 --> 01:00:30,340
Well... I admit that,

758
01:00:31,282 --> 01:00:34,360
I still can't fix my habit
of allowing others to work on their own.

759
01:00:34,709 --> 01:00:36,464
I have my weaknesses, actually.

760
01:00:36,464 --> 01:00:38,794
And you know what they are.

761
01:00:41,002 --> 01:00:45,000
How would I know that?

762
01:00:48,782 --> 01:00:53,171
It's just that I'm so straightforward and blunt,
that everyone hates me.

763
01:00:54,835 --> 01:00:57,632
Oh, it's this.

764
01:00:58,937 --> 01:01:03,081
What you see as a strength
can also become a weakness.

765
01:01:08,118 --> 01:01:10,640
Being so perfect nobody dares to approach me.

766
01:01:11,842 --> 01:01:14,148
And those who dare...
they're just taking advantage of me.

767
01:01:14,416 --> 01:01:19,050
But I'm so tired of having to wear a mask
for the sake of society.

768
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:24,391
I promise that...

769
01:01:24,978 --> 01:01:28,760
I will give you freedom to do this work as you want.

770
01:01:30,001 --> 01:01:32,001
Now I'm considering...

771
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:35,680
letting you lead this project yourself.

772
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:42,619
Ok.

773
01:01:51,921 --> 01:01:53,921
(You was good.)

774
01:01:54,521 --> 01:01:56,521
(Love you all.)

775
01:02:14,665 --> 01:02:18,120
Hello. My name is Aim, Senior Officer of Marcom.

776
01:02:19,383 --> 01:02:22,485
I'm going to start the conference now.

777
01:02:23,182 --> 01:02:28,367
Today, our Marketing Director Juang,
will be joining the conference with us.

778
01:02:28,804 --> 01:02:30,314
So if you're ready...

779
01:02:30,696 --> 01:02:31,640
Please welcome, Mr. Chot.

780
01:02:34,298 --> 01:02:38,074
For the main part that will judge
from the last time it will look like this.

781
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:44,840
The strategy and key message is
still be fresh, be lively, pick lively+.

782
01:02:45,001 --> 01:02:48,593
It's the new idea that digital team
would like to present at that option.

783
01:02:51,564 --> 01:02:53,135
Umm for this section,

784
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:58,774
I will be presenting about the
additional option of the online campaign,

785
01:02:58,774 --> 01:03:00,171
from the main advertisement.

786
01:03:00,171 --> 01:03:04,743
This is to expand online channel
with more customers,

787
01:03:04,743 --> 01:03:07,852
and with unlimited online marketing budget.

788
01:03:07,852 --> 01:03:12,419
We have to solely focus on communicating
to only one target group,

789
01:03:12,419 --> 01:03:14,751
which is the newer generation.

790
01:03:14,751 --> 01:03:20,648
They are help conscious like good travel,
and nature drive electric and eco cars.

791
01:03:20,648 --> 01:03:24,757
Although, we are slower than the others brand
in entering the market,

792
01:03:24,757 --> 01:03:29,692
but that also our strength because
we're a newer option for the customers,

793
01:03:29,692 --> 01:03:33,862
and as for the clip that
will be used to promote on social media,

794
01:03:33,862 --> 01:03:38,415
it will be a short film format
which tells the story two strangers,

795
01:03:38,415 --> 01:03:41,281
with different heartbreak circumstances,

796
01:03:41,281 --> 01:03:43,899
while one is upon in love,

797
01:03:43,899 --> 01:03:48,881
the other is a workaholic and
getting frustrated by work.

798
01:03:48,881 --> 01:03:50,160
It's a sad ending?

799
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:56,885
Ah no it's not a sad ending, despite parting ways,
they will both grow from the experience,

800
01:03:56,885 --> 01:04:00,477
and bring a positive vibe to encounter their lives,

801
01:04:00,477 --> 01:04:07,090
which is in line with the key message
"be fresh, be lively, pick lively+."

802
01:04:09,621 --> 01:04:12,640
I'm fine with his ideas.

803
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:19,867
But to let an inexperienced new graduate like Pat,

804
01:04:20,135 --> 01:04:23,727
work on such a big project,
I'm afraid...

805
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:26,760
it might not be a really good idea.

806
01:04:28,361 --> 01:04:29,136
It's true.

807
01:04:30,081 --> 01:04:33,200
We don't want to fail with a little problem like this.

808
01:04:34,064 --> 01:04:39,480
But if Nadia wants to take a risk,
I'll have nothing against it.

809
01:04:43,783 --> 01:04:44,497
I think...

810
01:04:44,763 --> 01:04:47,559
It's very interesting.

811
01:04:48,228 --> 01:04:51,208
But let me in my team...

812
01:04:51,208 --> 01:04:53,530
talk about it, think about it for a little bit,

813
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:56,807
and we would get back to you
as soon as possible.

814
01:04:56,807 --> 01:04:59,190
For now, thank you so much everyone.

815
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:27,009
Every morning brings with it the same old thing.

816
01:05:27,009 --> 01:05:30,379
No one comes into my life and makes it new.

817
01:05:30,379 --> 01:05:31,052
Makes it new, guys!

818
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:34,753
When I go out, I see many people.

819
01:05:34,753 --> 01:05:38,021
All I see is how they're full of love everywhere.

820
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:41,614
So why do I still have nobody?

821
01:05:41,614 --> 01:05:44,563
No! Nobody!

822
01:05:47,749 --> 01:05:49,437
Nobody to love.

823
01:05:49,437 --> 01:05:52,555
No colors in my life anywhere.

824
01:05:52,555 --> 01:06:01,390
By my side. Eyes meet eyes.
My heart beats fast.

825
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:07,493
So we'll miss each other.
So we'll miss each other.

826
01:06:07,493 --> 01:06:11,670
Love. I need some body love.

827
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:14,714
I need somebody, love.

828
01:06:14,714 --> 01:06:18,177
To keep my heart busy.

829
01:06:18,177 --> 01:06:21,618
Really busy! Really busy!

830
01:06:21,618 --> 01:06:32,731
I need somebody, love.

831
01:06:39,886 --> 01:06:41,886
My knees aren't quite all right.

832
01:06:41,886 --> 01:06:43,820
What's wrong?

833
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:45,731
Not too bad. Not too bad.

834
01:06:46,054 --> 01:06:46,866
Ok.

835
01:06:46,866 --> 01:06:47,523
Keep singing.

836
01:06:47,523 --> 01:06:49,280
Someone who cares.

837
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:51,370
Someone who truly loves me.

838
01:06:52,110 --> 01:06:53,008
I'm done!

839
01:06:59,576 --> 01:07:00,596
Done!

840
01:07:00,596 --> 01:07:01,204
Finally!

841
01:07:01,204 --> 01:07:05,484
Yeah! It's done! Well done! Excellent!

842
01:07:05,484 --> 01:07:08,264
Urgh! It's finally done! Thank God!

843
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,904
I got 93 marks.

844
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:15,201
Who's gonna beat me out?

845
01:07:15,201 --> 01:07:17,877
Nobody. No one.

846
01:07:17,877 --> 01:07:18,852
No way.

847
01:07:18,852 --> 01:07:20,287
Thank you everyone.

848
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:21,840
Not at all. I just got 70 lately.

849
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:22,669
What a bootlicker!

850
01:07:24,144 --> 01:07:26,450
You have such a beautiful voice, Mr. Jeng.

851
01:07:27,973 --> 01:07:28,748
Mr. Chot.

852
01:07:29,299 --> 01:07:31,666
Mr. Chot, have you seen Pat?

853
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:36,062
I saw you got some cotton
in you ears like a corpse.

854
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,515
Nobody was wearing earplugs.

855
01:07:39,493 --> 01:07:41,493
Was he wearing in-ear monitors or something?

856
01:08:03,401 --> 01:08:05,217
(Ae: I did a test. It's nothing.)

857
01:08:18,573 --> 01:08:19,960
You don't  have fun?

858
01:08:23,530 --> 01:08:25,101
I was about to get inside.

859
01:08:27,298 --> 01:08:29,298
Are you thinking about what Uncle Juang
said in the conference room?

860
01:08:41,485 --> 01:08:43,080
Can I ask you something?

861
01:08:45,490 --> 01:08:49,120
Why did you still decide to
let me lead this project?

862
01:08:49,512 --> 01:08:51,696
It's clear that I'm the team's weakness.

863
01:08:53,556 --> 01:08:55,654
That makes them criticize you.

864
01:08:58,519 --> 01:09:01,320
So what do you think is the reason
why I chose you for this task?

865
01:09:04,148 --> 01:09:05,352
I don't know.

866
01:09:15,344 --> 01:09:17,283
Open what I've sent to you, Pat.

867
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:32,008
See?

868
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:35,520
You're actually highly potential.

869
01:09:36,931 --> 01:09:41,280
The only thing I want to point out is a little bit
about your emotional control.

870
01:09:41,682 --> 01:09:46,438
I'm putting a lot of pressure on you
because I see how competent you are.

871
01:09:47,319 --> 01:09:50,605
You have to trust yourself like I trust you.

872
01:09:51,975 --> 01:09:54,400
The reason why Uncle Juang
attacked you with that point,

873
01:09:54,733 --> 01:09:57,590
was that your presentation was really great.

874
01:09:58,441 --> 01:10:00,760
So, instead, he had to bring it up
and try to beat you out.

875
01:10:02,958 --> 01:10:03,672
Really?

876
01:10:05,211 --> 01:10:08,497
My uncle has a knack for finding one's weakness
and piercing right through it, just like that.

877
01:10:16,372 --> 01:10:18,188
Thank you, Mr. Jeng.

878
01:10:21,259 --> 01:10:22,095
I think...

879
01:10:23,711 --> 01:10:25,711
I'm gonna get back into the room.

880
01:10:26,833 --> 01:10:27,792
I'll go later, then.

881
01:10:27,792 --> 01:10:28,296
Yeah.

882
01:10:59,735 --> 01:11:02,654
Hey! What're you doing, darling?

883
01:11:03,444 --> 01:11:05,077
Are you blind or something?

884
01:11:05,077 --> 01:11:07,320
Awww, it smells sweet.

885
01:11:07,932 --> 01:11:11,402
Get out! The cream is expensive!

886
01:11:11,402 --> 01:11:12,947
Come on. I'll apply it on you.

887
01:11:13,872 --> 01:11:15,321
I'll do it myself.

888
01:11:15,321 --> 01:11:16,442
Let me.

889
01:11:16,442 --> 01:11:18,268
What's it with this loving act today?

890
01:11:18,823 --> 01:11:19,966
It smells so good.

891
01:11:19,966 --> 01:11:21,485
Hmmm...

892
01:11:22,607 --> 01:11:24,178
You love me. Yeah.

893
01:11:25,598 --> 01:11:26,760
Do you want it?

894
01:11:27,572 --> 01:11:28,470
Just a bit?

895
01:11:39,113 --> 01:11:40,623
Why on earth are you calling me, Jaab?!

896
01:11:40,623 --> 01:11:41,601
Answer him first.

897
01:11:41,601 --> 01:11:42,861
Urgh! He can wait!

898
01:11:42,861 --> 01:11:44,079
Answer him first!

899
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:45,317
He can...

900
01:11:46,361 --> 01:11:46,952
Answer him!

901
01:11:48,191 --> 01:11:48,782
Ok.

902
01:11:51,648 --> 01:11:52,913
Why are you calling me, Jaab?

903
01:11:53,972 --> 01:11:55,237
Hey! What's up?

904
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:56,311
Kanun! What the...!

905
01:12:00,491 --> 01:12:02,981
(Kanun said you're hiding something from me.)

906
01:12:04,948 --> 01:12:11,296
All right. I thought you'd called me at night
for some matter of life and death.

907
01:12:11,909 --> 01:12:14,740
This is to me.

908
01:12:20,335 --> 01:12:23,131
Okay. I'm sorry, Jen.

909
01:12:23,889 --> 01:12:24,603
Well...

910
01:12:25,483 --> 01:12:27,483
That was why I didn't want you to know that.

911
01:12:28,681 --> 01:12:30,314
I tried.

912
01:12:31,104 --> 01:12:33,410
I tried so hard.

913
01:12:34,597 --> 01:12:37,577
I tried to stop my feelings for...

914
01:12:37,845 --> 01:12:40,519
You just like someone,
so why didn't you tell me?

915
01:12:41,117 --> 01:12:42,840
I thought we were close friends.

916
01:12:43,286 --> 01:12:45,000
What?

917
01:12:45,367 --> 01:12:49,756
Kanun told me that I was the third wheel.

918
01:12:49,756 --> 01:12:52,183
The way I'm with you all the time,

919
01:12:52,183 --> 01:12:54,311
would make the one you like get the wrong point.

920
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,023
I'm sorry.

921
01:12:56,023 --> 01:13:01,330
From now on, I will keep some distance from you,
so you don't feel uncomfortable.

922
01:13:01,697 --> 01:13:05,412
Wait, you're saying you will stay away from me?

923
01:13:05,987 --> 01:13:09,518
Well, that's how that person won't get you wrong again.

924
01:13:09,786 --> 01:13:15,338
Treat me to food for the rest of my life
as your repentance.

925
01:13:17,167 --> 01:13:18,120
What the... dude!

926
01:13:18,545 --> 01:13:19,872
Hey! Jaab!

927
01:13:19,872 --> 01:13:21,873
What? He just hung up.

928
01:13:23,902 --> 01:13:24,640
What have you done?

929
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:25,943
I don't know. I don't wanna think now.

930
01:13:26,377 --> 01:13:27,642
Anyway, let's go on, darling.

931
01:13:29,663 --> 01:13:30,163
Go on.

932
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:31,306
Go on, right?

933
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:32,670
Get down!

934
01:13:34,266 --> 01:13:35,654
This roar again!

935
01:13:35,654 --> 01:13:36,293
Come on, honey.

936
01:13:38,033 --> 01:13:38,992
It feels so good.

937
01:13:40,490 --> 01:13:40,990
You like it, honey?

938
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:42,755
I freaking love it, my dear! Ouch!

939
01:13:42,755 --> 01:13:43,386
Darling!

940
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:05,894
(Jeng: The Forge project has been approved.
We can make an appointment with a production house now.)

941
01:14:06,521 --> 01:14:07,541
Yesss!

942
01:14:10,508 --> 01:14:11,651
Yesss!

943
01:14:44,253 --> 01:14:51,276
(Pat: Thank you, Mr. Jeng.
I'll do my best.)

944
01:15:16,542 --> 01:15:17,746
Pat's weakness.

945
01:15:35,883 --> 01:15:37,332
Hello, Ms. Nadia.

946
01:15:38,226 --> 01:15:40,040
Can I speak to you for a moment?

947
01:15:40,435 --> 01:15:43,109
Yeh, the reason I'm calling you now is a...

948
01:15:43,109 --> 01:15:45,782
I just want you to be confident in my team.

949
01:15:46,466 --> 01:15:51,038
I just want you to know that right now
we are working hard as a team.

950
01:15:51,919 --> 01:15:55,450
And I'm really trying to
get my team together you know,

951
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:57,558
and that there's no need you to worry at all.

952
01:15:59,105 --> 01:16:01,760
Because pat's weakness,
me and my team will cover it up,

953
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:05,874
and I really believe that you know
everybody can improve themselves.

954
01:16:05,874 --> 01:16:08,475
They just need a chance and a little bit of time.

955
01:16:09,271 --> 01:16:11,560
Thank you, thank you for your understanding,

956
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:16,401
and I really hope that Jian group and Forge,
can continue to collaborate in the future.

957
01:16:16,817 --> 01:16:17,653
Ok ma‘am.

958
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:20,320
Thank you.

959
01:16:20,828 --> 01:16:21,603
Bye.

960
01:16:40,267 --> 01:16:41,410
What are you looking at?

961
01:16:42,696 --> 01:16:44,206
That's not Mr. Chot.

962
01:16:44,206 --> 01:16:46,038
That's Miss Chot!

963
01:16:46,684 --> 01:16:48,377
Oh my gosh, look at the pose!

964
01:16:48,377 --> 01:16:52,474
Yes, werk it, small waist and werk it, werk it!

965
01:16:52,474 --> 01:16:55,129
He is really mother and the moment!

966
01:16:55,129 --> 01:16:59,092
At first I was going to ask him out,
but I guess that option is out!

967
01:17:00,378 --> 01:17:03,303
My gaydar is so broken!

968
01:17:04,116 --> 01:17:05,442
What are they watching?

969
01:17:05,710 --> 01:17:09,486
I think it must be Chot's video
from the karaoke bar,

970
01:17:09,815 --> 01:17:11,264
because they shared it in the chat group.

971
01:17:13,272 --> 01:17:15,000
Hello Mr. Jeng.

972
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:15,616
Hi.

973
01:17:15,616 --> 01:17:16,728
Hello.

974
01:17:16,728 --> 01:17:21,314
Why are you guys still standing around here?
Go to work!

975
01:17:22,294 --> 01:17:25,274
So people still don't know?

976
01:17:26,338 --> 01:17:28,338
I think they were just still curious.

977
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:30,818
I really have to thank you,

978
01:17:30,818 --> 01:17:33,721
for letting Chot choose the restaurant
and organize the whole event.

979
01:17:35,944 --> 01:17:40,455
And what about you suspecting
that I was hiding a girl?

980
01:17:42,016 --> 01:17:44,200
Have you met my girlfriend yet?

981
01:17:48,735 --> 01:17:50,245
Don't tell me,

982
01:17:52,408 --> 01:17:54,520
that it's true.

983
01:17:56,938 --> 01:18:00,000
I have so many busy buddy subordinates
in my department like this,

984
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,876
so where would I find the time for a girlfriend?

985
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:12,285
Alright then, I'll go get some coffee.

986
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:31,920
That's why the name is familiar,
I really didn't think that it would be Jaab.

987
01:18:32,187 --> 01:18:35,289
Baan Jay Production House
is a regular with the Jian Group.

988
01:18:36,069 --> 01:18:37,150
Uh...

989
01:18:37,283 --> 01:18:39,957
Well, if I'm not very proud to say,

990
01:18:40,667 --> 01:18:41,480
it's about connections.

991
01:18:51,561 --> 01:18:52,840
It smells so familiar.

992
01:18:57,816 --> 01:19:00,857
Do you use a cream that's in a pink bottle?

993
01:19:02,161 --> 01:19:03,059
Right?

994
01:19:05,287 --> 01:19:07,655
Why? Is it stinky?

995
01:19:10,617 --> 01:19:11,880
I think it smells nice.

996
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:14,144
No, it's not stinky.

997
01:19:14,144 --> 01:19:15,915
It just smells familiar.

998
01:19:19,504 --> 01:19:23,158
Hey, are you going home today?

999
01:19:23,548 --> 01:19:24,752
Yes.

1000
01:19:25,041 --> 01:19:27,041
Ah, could you bring this home to mom?

1001
01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:34,203
Take it.

1002
01:19:36,921 --> 01:19:37,880
Come on.

1003
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:42,880
(Mr. Jeng just walked out
with a woman's hand bag!)

1004
01:19:44,039 --> 01:19:45,427
Fine.

1005
01:19:48,879 --> 01:19:50,267
You're too lazy to go home right?

1006
01:19:52,489 --> 01:19:53,877
Thanks bro.

1007
01:20:00,579 --> 01:20:02,640
Always making me do stuff for him.

1008
01:20:22,819 --> 01:20:24,145
I gotta go now.

1009
01:20:30,347 --> 01:20:31,306
Thank you Mr. Jeng.

1010
01:20:31,306 --> 01:20:32,169
See you later.

1011
01:21:01,021 --> 01:21:01,858
Pat.

1012
01:21:05,869 --> 01:21:07,073
Put? What are you doing here?

1013
01:21:10,430 --> 01:21:11,560
Were you drinking?

1014
01:21:14,399 --> 01:21:15,000
Who dropped you off?

1015
01:21:17,782 --> 01:21:18,840
My friend.

1016
01:21:25,746 --> 01:21:26,766
I want to see you again.

1017
01:21:30,936 --> 01:21:32,507
Can you give me another chance?

1018
01:21:39,582 --> 01:21:40,418
Put.

1019
01:21:43,197 --> 01:21:45,197
Our relationship has been over for 2 years.

1020
01:21:49,189 --> 01:21:50,960
Please give me another chance.

1021
01:21:58,758 --> 01:21:59,411
Let me help.

1022
01:21:59,411 --> 01:22:00,348
It's ok.

1023
01:22:02,373 --> 01:22:03,454
It's ok, let me help.

1024
01:22:03,454 --> 01:22:04,274
It's ok Put.

1025
01:22:05,149 --> 01:22:05,802
Let me help you.

1026
01:22:26,271 --> 01:22:27,842
Please don't do this.

1027
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:06,232
I would like to introduce PutKris couple.

1028
01:23:06,655 --> 01:23:08,360
Do you have any more actors?

1029
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:12,920
From these choices,
PutKris is likely to be the best among all.

1030
01:23:15,369 --> 01:23:16,757
I'm worried about Pat,

1031
01:23:16,757 --> 01:23:18,441
afraid he can't handle it.

1032
01:23:18,441 --> 01:23:20,619
If we make it very visualized,

1033
01:23:20,619 --> 01:23:23,015
and use the real actors taking a block shot.

1034
01:23:23,015 --> 01:23:24,472
Forge may buy our idea.

1035
01:23:24,472 --> 01:23:27,456
You're like born and already at a finish line.

1036
01:23:28,056 --> 01:23:30,886
Could you tell me that it's gonna be worth.

1037
01:23:30,886 --> 01:23:32,934
Do you want to do the work well?
