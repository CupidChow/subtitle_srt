1
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,080
Good morning, Pat.

2
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,680
I hope it's going to be your lucky day.

3
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:16,070
Good morning.

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,930
- Good morning, Pat.
- Good morning.

5
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,210
As I've always said,

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,210
Work is so important to
our present and future,

7
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,440
just like the money you make from it.

8
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,230
Pat.

9
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,050
Pat.

10
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:02,580
Pat.

11
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:04,850
Yes?

12
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,220
You didn't even hear my voice.

13
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,930
Well, it's because of my new earbuds.

14
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,880
They cancel noise so well.

15
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,880
Ah, they're so good.

16
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,500
Yes.

17
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,810
Snacks?

18
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,450
Yes, please. Thanks, Ying.

19
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,600
I sent you a presentation slide,
please translate it.

20
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,140
I'll use it in the meeting
with the branding team

21
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,400
Monday at 1:00 p.m.

22
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,400
OK.

23
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,190
Monday.

24
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,070
Monday at 1:00 p.m.

25
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,360
Repeat it.

26
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,480
Monday at 1:00 p.m.

27
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,130
Thank you so much.

28
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,320
- You're welcome.
- Thank you so much.

29
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,830
How cute!

30
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:50,420
Pat, Pat.

31
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,160
Pat.

32
00:01:51,762 --> 00:01:53,762
Could you edit my presentation
slide's layout to match the brand CI?

33
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,600
It's just 16 slides.
(BRAND CI:)

34
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,970
I want it by this afternoon.
(brand identity)

35
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,500
Look, I have to meet the board
on the 58th floor.

36
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,210
They want to see it first.

37
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,970
OK, but is there anything I have to
translate? I'm afraid I can't make it in time.

38
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,770
Well, just a few topics.

39
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,510
You can just get it done
with a flick of your fingers.

40
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,960
Please?

41
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:08,770
OK, Prem.

42
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:09,790
Thank you.

43
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:10,830
Thank you.

44
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:15,534
Pat.

45
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,910
Do you want me to
translate all of this?

46
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,580
No, these don't need to be
translated, but you have to discard them.

47
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:30,535
Oh, but how about the words in
the NDA I asked you to check?

48
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,700
I sent it back to you this morning,

49
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,660
Ahhh.

50
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,480
But we'd better have
the legal team check them.

51
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,140
No, they're so annoying

52
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,940
and they'll just have a check
before signing it, I guess.

53
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,730
But,

54
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:44,840
Hold on.

55
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:46,730
Hello.

56
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,820
OK, have you arrived?

57
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,740
OK, I'll send someone down to get you.

58
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,560
OK, thank you.

59
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,410
Are you available, Pat?

60
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,620
Can you go down and get my
snack for me? I'm having a meeting.

61
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,650
Pat, please.

62
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,770
Please, please,

63
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:06,910
just a few seconds.

64
00:03:10,881 --> 00:03:11,730
No, Oil.

65
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,000
I have to do a
translation for Ying,

66
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,240
change the presentation
slide's layout for Prem,

67
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,250
and do what you just
told me to do recently.

68
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,730
So how can I make
time to get your delivery?

69
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,500
Pat.

70
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,230
Pat.

71
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,030
Pat.

72
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,070
I'm gonna get it for you, Oil.

73
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,190
OK, thank you so much.

74
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,310
I'm headed for the meeting.

75
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,580
But, after all,

76
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,590
nothing is more important than your
physical and mental well-being, kid.

77
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,100
Think of it,

78
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,450
it's been over a
month of probation,

79
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,380
but all I have done is translate presentation
slides, copy documents, and get packages.

80
00:04:08,811 --> 00:04:11,661
So how on earth can my boss know
what kinds of job suit me?

81
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,960
- Um.
- To be fair,

82
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,350
They might be busy,

83
00:04:16,835 --> 00:04:19,455
so they still haven't let you do so
many things, we still have 8 months to go.

84
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,030
Yeah, so much time left.

85
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,760
Or, they're just so terrible

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,200
they can't even train you,
because they can't even do it themselves.

87
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,300
Right.

88
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:26,750
See?

89
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,840
Just like that!

90
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,420
Especially Ying.

91
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,190
How long has she worked here?

92
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,220
She can't even be bothered
to translate basic English words.

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,720
Why doesn't she just create the slide
in English?

94
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,960
Why did she make it in Thai
and have it translated afterwards?

95
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,340
- I don't get it.
- Damn, Pat, be quiet.

96
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,530
This place is around your office, have
some respect for your employee card.

97
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,220
Damn, just eat it.

98
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,410
Well, tell us.

99
00:04:49,015 --> 00:04:50,915
How's the staff in one of the
country's biggest companies?

100
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:52,940
Tell me.

101
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,580
I don't even want to think of them.

102
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,010
It's like living in a third-world country.

103
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,290
Let's begin with Ying's squad,
they're such freaks.

104
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,510
It's as if they had been working
for so long they would never be fired

105
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,510
and I don't think they can quit,
they're too old and useless.

106
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,010
They go home together.

107
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,790
Really, but they also leave
from the same house?

108
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,420
Right?

109
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,370
What you did is right

110
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,470
but they love to gossip.

111
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,550
They just spend a day gossiping
about celebrities and their boss.

112
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,690
Well, you're not like that at all Pat.

113
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,140
It's not the same,
this is sharing some information.

114
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,210
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

115
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,200
Anyway, I don't know
what's wrong with them.

116
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,990
They've got computers and emails,

117
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,110
but they just print
and copy documents for each other.

118
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,980
The world has entered the paperless era,

119
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,650
but they still use
flash drives? Imagine..

120
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,500
Really?

121
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,060
And the men are really toxic.

122
00:05:48,644 --> 00:05:50,224
How? Like Britney Spears?

123
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,210
For example Prem,
he's got a wife and kid,

124
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,090
but he harasses the girls
in another department.

125
00:05:57,294 --> 00:05:59,274
Saying things like are you trying
to turn me on with that move?

126
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,720
Oooh! What a turn-on!

127
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,820
Your glasses just make me wet!

128
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,810
Geez! How was it?

129
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,060
Not to mention sexist jokes
that they hype each other with.

130
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:16,480
They think they're so cool,
so manly for oppressing others.

131
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,150
- I'm not okay about this either.
- Er.

132
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,520
So can't you tell your boss about it?

133
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,180
My manager?
(MANAGER: manager)

134
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,170
Yeah.

135
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,690
He's so passive and timid.

136
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,270
But he's quitting,
so there's no point, I think.

137
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,850
You must keep fighting, Pat.

138
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,240
Yes, you must.

139
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,220
I'm not telling you to tolerate it,
but you must fight.

140
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,670
- What?
- Don't tolerate it,

141
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:38,830
try saying no.

142
00:06:39,163 --> 00:06:42,333
What they did is not OK, like the
sexist jokes. I'm really not OK with it.

143
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,950
Don't give in.

144
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,750
Yeah, just don't.

145
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,850
Through the changing generations,
new forms of knowledge

146
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,440
has been developed and carried on
by new generations.

147
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,520
Jian Group

148
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,800
sees their potential,
so we have welcomed new generations

149
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:07,907
and won Best Employer of Asia
for the fourth consecutive year,

150
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,870
because we're dedicated to
changing the world with the youth's power.

151
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,220
Work with us.

152
00:07:17,108 --> 00:07:17,920
(47)

153
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,480
Hey, Pat.

154
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,650
Speak of the devil.

155
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,320
You're already in the lift,
so don't come out.

156
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:27,835
Go buy glass jelly for me, please.
It's not too much.

157
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,620
Thank you.

158
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,230
Go down now.

159
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:34,820
Yes.

160
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,880
Thank you.

161
00:08:09,634 --> 00:08:12,794
Whenever work brings
down your mind too much,

162
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,030
just take a step back.

163
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,600
Excuse me, let me..

164
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,650
for yourself,

165
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,070
Thanes Tungwattana.

166
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,160
Shit!

167
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,670
(I don't know when I fell for you.)

168
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,810
(I definitely see you as more than a friend.)

169
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:16,500
(I wonder when did I start feeling like this.)

170
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,560
(All I can do is miss you but your face.)

171
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,590
(I see it in my dreams and I'm sleepwalking.)

172
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:24,340
(Before I knew it, I'd fallen for you.)

173
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,770
(I wanted to fall in love with you step by step
but it took me by surprise.)

174
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:32,420
(I can't stop myself from loving you.)

175
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,530
(In my heart,
it says every time that only you.)

176
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,040
(I love you every single day.)

177
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,800
(Step By Step)
(Episode 1)

178
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,410
I'd better carry it myself.

179
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,560
That's fine.

180
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,740
I'm sorry, really sorry.

181
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,170
That's all right. It's clean now.

182
00:10:21,336 --> 00:10:23,896
So, thank you for carrying it for me.

183
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,280
You're welcome.

184
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,380
I gotta go now,
so please give it back to me.

185
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:33,580
Okay.

186
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,300
Thank you.

187
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:03,590
Shit!

188
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,990
The executives' floor?

189
00:11:13,546 --> 00:11:16,836
Three glasses left?! One was spilt?

190
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,990
I'm so sorry, Ying. I'm very sorry.

191
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,120
I'll pay for it.

192
00:11:24,962 --> 00:11:27,892
Well, I'll just think I'm on sugar diet.

193
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:31,310
Don't forget to transfer your money
to the same account, then.

194
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:32,720
OK.

195
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,260
Um.

196
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:34,910
Hey,

197
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:40,050
don't forget to vote for a restaurant
for Manager Wirun's goodbye party.

198
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:41,960
OK.

199
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,670
And after the transaction,
don't forget to send me the receipt.

200
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,590
Pat,

201
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,790
I think you should transfer me the
money before choosing the restaurant.

202
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,860
Don't forget.

203
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,310
(Pat: the beautiful sky
is very soothing today.)

204
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,480
(Dad: To enjoy little things)

205
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,430
(means you're becoming an adult.)

206
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:43,710
(Dad: Well done, Pat.)

207
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,520
Hello, Ae.

208
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,610
Pat, Pearl &amp; Oliver tonight?

209
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,707
OK, I'm kind of bummed out today.

210
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,270
I've got such a heavy workload.

211
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,660
Me too, and we're not
gonna drink that much.

212
00:13:10,027 --> 00:13:12,707
OK, deal,
but I might not stay up too late.

213
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,630
OK, I promise.

214
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,280
See you tonight!
I've got something to tell you.

215
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,220
Please wait for a moment.

216
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:31,980
Yes.

217
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,100
Can I treat you a coffee as an apology?

218
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,100
At this time?

219
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:41,731
I don't think I'll fall asleep.

220
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,670
Well, I'm sorry. I just forgot.

221
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,250
You can treat me one when we meet again.

222
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,920
Do you work here?

223
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,510
Not really.

224
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,006
Here are your items.

225
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,570
Thank you.

226
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,780
Are you buying out the whole bakery?

227
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,520
They're closing,
and I saw they had discounts.

228
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,280
They make new bread day by day,

229
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,150
and the leftover must be discarded
although it's still edible.

230
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,600
I always buy them all
when I pass through.

231
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,230
Food waste?

232
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:18,210
Yes.

233
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,910
If we keep bread in a fridge,
we can extend their expiry date by 2-3 days.

234
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,850
Would you like some?

235
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,670
No, thanks.

236
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,680
I think I should go home.

237
00:14:33,616 --> 00:14:34,340
Thank you.

238
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,720
Are you sure you wouldn't like some?

239
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,320
I'll give it to someone else.

240
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:44,960
Yes.

241
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,900
See you later.

242
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,570
(Ae: Can you give me a spoiler
of what you want to tell me?)

243
00:15:12,872 --> 00:15:14,092
He's so handsome!

244
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,600
And he cares about the environment.

245
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,380
He just made me
think of Greta Thunberg.

246
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,554
So you didn't even think to ask his name?

247
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,010
You've met him a few times,

248
00:15:23,207 --> 00:15:25,157
from the glass jelly
stuff you told me about.

249
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,080
Eh, destiny?

250
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,980
Don't be so dramatic!

251
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,700
You can make your own destiny, Pat.

252
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:36,400
Don’t go off too much.
He might be straight, right?

253
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,370
So what?

254
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,570
- Ummm.
- Let me tell you something.

255
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,500
Many people are gay or bi these days.

256
00:15:43,751 --> 00:15:44,901
You must be brave.

257
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,550
Don't ruin your own reputation.

258
00:15:47,343 --> 00:15:50,483
Where is Pat, my confident intern?

259
00:15:51,545 --> 00:15:53,885
Yeah, do you remember?

260
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,190
The internship goodbye party.

261
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:56,520
Um.

262
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:57,390
The time when....

263
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,460
Wait, bro!

264
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,390
- Internship.
- Wait, Beam.

265
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,810
- When you asked a guy for a cigarette.
- Wait.

266
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,175
- Beam.
- Right?

267
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,140
- Very slutty!
- Very slutty!

268
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,000
Cheers!

269
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:11,780
Enough.

270
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,090
Don't you remember?

271
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,370
Excuse me, do you have a cigarette?

272
00:16:16,074 --> 00:16:17,314
- Beam.
- What?

273
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,980
Hey, have you just arrived, Kanun?

274
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,380
Hey.

275
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,750
- Hi, Kanun.
- Hi, Pat. Hi, Beam.

276
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,720
Ewww, you smell!
Did you already have a drink?

277
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:27,940
So how could you drive here?

278
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:29,620
I didn't.

279
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,280
Jarb did.

280
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,230
Look at you!

281
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,180
Hey, let me join your table.

282
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,180
Just order some.

283
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,560
More glasses?

284
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,650
No, I don't drink.
(Ying: Location Image of Karaoke restaurant)

285
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,180
Can't you just stay still?

286
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,430
(Oil: Great!)

287
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,770
(Arm: This is my mic!
Pream: Make it through the whole night, everyone!)

288
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,290
May I go to the toilet?

289
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,310
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

290
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,320
Can I get a glass?
I really want to drink today.

291
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:57,920
More glasses, please!

292
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,380
You're really not all right.

293
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,370
OK, OK, I'm sorry.

294
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:33,950
Who's that?

295
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,570
Jarb!

296
00:17:38,616 --> 00:17:39,420
How dirty!

297
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,860
I've pissed all over because of you!

298
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,180
What's wrong, Jarb?

299
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,010
What?

300
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,230
Hey, Jarb!

301
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,840
Are you all right?

302
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,660
Jarb!
Open it, Jarb! What's wrong?!

303
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,300
Jarb!

304
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,410
Jarb!

305
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:53,840
Open the door!

306
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:54,900
Jarb!

307
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,780
I was kidding.

308
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,170
So... Oscar?

309
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,080
Or a Golden Globe?

310
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,170
Razzy!

311
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,700
Pat!

312
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,810
Hey, wait.

313
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:14,840
Wait.

314
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,810
Wait, Pat.

315
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,414
It's so refreshing.

316
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:22,865
You're eating too much.

317
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,470
How was my Oscar-deserving performance?

318
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,450
Get away from me, Jarb.

319
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,260
- Don't bother me.
- Wasn't it fun?

320
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,420
No, it wasn't.

321
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:35,980
What did you do to tease him?

322
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,680
No, I didn't.

323
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,720
Let's switch.

324
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,840
Sit down.

325
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:43,810
What's that?

326
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,100
Tay, the restaurant owner, gave this
for us to try. He said it's a new dish.

327
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,290
What? What's that?

328
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,530
Just eat it,
milk ice cream with glass jelly.

329
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,770
Just eat it.

330
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,320
Glass jelly again.

331
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:55,950
Um.

332
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:57,806
Yuck!

333
00:18:58,436 --> 00:19:00,276
You don't want it? Give it to me.

334
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,670
No, I won't let you eat it.

335
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:14,950
How was it?

336
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,060
Good.

337
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,170
So great!

338
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,130
Good, right?

339
00:19:20,871 --> 00:19:22,561
Let me eat it too.

340
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,060
No, I won't.

341
00:19:27,421 --> 00:19:28,771
Pat, why won't you share it with me?

342
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:30,690
Come on, it's fine.

343
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,510
- Here, eat.
- Um.

344
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,070
Hey, why did you get to eat it?

345
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,220
I can't talk back to my wife.

346
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,560
- Delicious.
- Good.

347
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,930
Yeah, you should sell it.

348
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:39,560
Really?

349
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,270
But wait.

350
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,720
Don't complain you're fat
when you eat this much.

351
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,350
I don't care.
My hubby is still gonna love me.

352
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,070
Yeah.

353
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,560
Yeah.

354
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:50,730
Don't eat it.

355
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,460
Don't eat it.

356
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,170
- Hey, let me eat some.
- No.

357
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,180
Hey, sit down.
What's the point of the quarrel?

358
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,500
Step back, guys, just step back.

359
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,190
Step back, sit down.

360
00:19:58,385 --> 00:20:00,285
Why don't you just ask Tae for some,
Jarb? You two know each other.

361
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,700
- Right.
- Why are you trying to get it from Pat?

362
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,410
I just want this one.

363
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,350
Fine, I'll give it to you.

364
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,400
Thanks a lot.

365
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:10,960
- Hey?
- The end.

366
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:12,340
Good.

367
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,810
- Glass jelly, good.
- Glass jelly, glass jelly.

368
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,300
I wanna eat it too!

369
00:20:18,204 --> 00:20:19,374
Here's your drink.

370
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,180
Thank you.

371
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,440
Do you remember the guy who
bought all bread on that day?

372
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,330
The one who often comes here, right?

373
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,710
I can, because he's handsome.

374
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,260
So do you know
what he does with the bread?

375
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,860
I can't ask him. I'm too shy.

376
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,930
But I think he gives it to the homeless.

377
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,200
Look at his body.
I don't think he can eat it all.

378
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,007
Ahhh, thank you.

379
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,330
You're welcome.

380
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,110
Hey, just get inside.

381
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:00,960
- Oh!
- Hey, why?

382
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,360
- Jarb.
- Hey, Pat.

383
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,280
Are you doing a pitch here?

384
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:05,890
Yeah.

385
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:12,480
This is Pat, Ae's junior peer.
Ae is Kanun's partner.

386
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,380
I see.

387
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:17,190
And this is Jen, Ban Jay's producer.

388
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,400
Nice to meet you, Pat.

389
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:23,840
Hello, Jen.

390
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:24,620
Yes.

391
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,880
Excuse me, I need to take this.

392
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:28,410
Um.

393
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,480
Hello, hello.

394
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,360
By the way, are you on a break?

395
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,180
I'm just buying some
drinks during work.

396
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,860
It's been so long, then.
You've drunk half of it.

397
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,220
Or...

398
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,420
Is your work stressful?

399
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:56,420
Well, that work, we can't make it now.

400
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:57,710
Really?

401
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,000
What should we do, then?

402
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,110
Hey, Pat. I gotta go.
My work has been canceled.

403
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:07,760
All right.

404
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,210
You're great. There's gonna be
a new opportunity for you.

405
00:22:11,756 --> 00:22:12,250
Come on.

406
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:15,140
Go!

407
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,900
Hey, the croissants here are so good.

408
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:21,920
Have you tried some?

409
00:22:24,858 --> 00:22:25,790
Here is your order.

410
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:36,980
Are they that good?

411
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,450
His name is Jeng, but he's a jerk!

412
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,320
- Is that so, Ying?
- Yeah.

413
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,380
He makes us do a lot of work,
and he lacks humanity.

414
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,660
- Ummm.
- He just orders and orders

415
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,990
- like a sergeant!
- Stop!

416
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,210
Don't call Jeng a sergeant.

417
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,900
Because he's
actually a woodpecker!

418
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,570
He keeps pecking, pecking,
and pecking all day long.

419
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,680
Then he makes a stern face!

420
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,290
And every word from
his lips is just nagging!

421
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,320
True, Ying.

422
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,930
His good-looking face
doesn't help him at all.

423
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,670
Everyone in the department just
hates him, so how dare he come back?

424
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:08,410
Is he back?

425
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,070
Look at your face.

426
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,550
- It's right to say he's back.
- Um.

427
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,580
- Let me tell you the whole story.
- Umm...

428
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,740
Well, our department.

429
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,490
When it was newly established,
the first manager

430
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,880
is so wonderful and
respectable. You remember him?

431
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,130
But after a while,

432
00:23:25,622 --> 00:23:26,992
this Jeng guy replaced him.

433
00:23:28,764 --> 00:23:29,884
At first,

434
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,060
we were still crazy for him,

435
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,100
- because he's handsome.
- Handsome.

436
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,770
- Very handsome.
- And he's the company's owner son.

437
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,330
- Really?
- The company's owner son?

438
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,730
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

439
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:42,140
Mr. Tayukom Uttachiranun is his father.
Don't you know him?

440
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,140
- His father, don't you know him?
- Yeah.

441
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:45,200
Ahhhh.

442
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,370
I see, so why did he quit?

443
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:53,820
Why are you asking, Pat?
Or are you interested in Jeng?

444
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,040
No, I'm not.

445
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:57,420
Nonsense.

446
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,200
I was just kidding.

447
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,100
Anyway,

448
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,740
Jeng doesn't care about seniority at all.

449
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:04,290
When he first came, he was like,

450
00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:05,484
"I want to change this and that."

451
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,560
And it caused such chaos.

452
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,770
- Um.
- You get it?

453
00:24:11,185 --> 00:24:12,825
And he's even younger than me,

454
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:16,240
and we don't know about his experience.
After a little while, he just said goodbye.

455
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:19,262
I don't like this kind
of boss, just saying.

456
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,600
But I don't think it has
to do with age, does it?

457
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,290
But it does with his position.

458
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,230
Age matters,

459
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,000
Whoa.

460
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,340
Because this is Thailand

461
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,700
in Thailand,
older people should always be respected,

462
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,920
although his father owns the company.

463
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,570
Yeah.

464
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:41,650
He's so young,
but he doesn't respect older workers.

465
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,720
Right, we don't even know how long
he has been working.

466
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,260
- Right.
- We don't even know what he did for work.

467
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:45,800
Yeah.

468
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,890
A new manager's assignment.

469
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,600
What?

470
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,620
- You see that?
- He ordered

471
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,400
us to submit it
a week before his observation.

472
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,360
You see?

473
00:24:58,970 --> 00:24:59,960
It's beginning.

474
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,220
He's just caused us burden
after a few minutes of his arrival.

475
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,760
Let me ask you one question.

476
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,190
- What?
- Why?

477
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,980
Do we have to review

478
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,590
- our job descriptions again?
- Yeah. - Yeah.

479
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:11,780
Is he a HR manager?

480
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,780
- Right.
- No, he's not!

481
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,340
- Exactly.
- And I'm not even done with other work.

482
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,090
Are you done with that one?

483
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,600
And we all know our own duties.

484
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,170
So why did he have us review it?

485
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,380
You see? Is it beginning?

486
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,190
- Such a workload!
- Who likes him?

487
00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:22,526
Let's try to...

488
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,730
Here's your order.

489
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,350
There're some croissants left.
Would you like some?

490
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,170
Yes, please. Thank you so much.

491
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,400
You're welcome. Wait for a second.

492
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,780
Are you cutting the line for my croissant?

493
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:47,588
Hello.

494
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,910
We meet again,
so I think I have to treat you a coffee.

495
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,620
It'll be too much for me today.

496
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:00,670
I see.

497
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,520
How does chocolate sound?

498
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,120
I'll have a hot one.

499
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,160
Of course.

500
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,030
Excuse me,

501
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,390
can I have a hot chocolate, please?

502
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,940
Yes, wait for a second.

503
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,780
Actually, I really love
the croissants here.

504
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:41,270
Not too expensive
and made with good ingredients.

505
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:44,650
Ummm, it's so good,
this is my very first try.

506
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,530
They're sold out in the afternoon.

507
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,720
But, fortunately,
the staff will keep some for me,

508
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,280
or I'll just miss them out.

509
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,900
Ummm, but I think they should

510
00:26:56,613 --> 00:26:58,533
have a pre-order service

511
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,930
and allow the customers
to pick the menus up and go.

512
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,720
But if they don't pay the money
or someone makes a fake order,

513
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,190
it'll be so bad.

514
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:07,850
Not really,

515
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,943
Not really, You can just make
an order online and pay through

516
00:27:10,967 --> 00:27:13,520
QR codes. It's not hard at all.
One admin is more than enough,

517
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,200
and it's just a little investment.

518
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,560
Maybe this solution
can even bring more customers.

519
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:24,090
This is a busy zone,
so I think GRAB&amp;GO will be a good solution.

520
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,630
Well, sorry. I'm talking too much.

521
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,250
No, it's very interesting.

522
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,720
Do you work in digital marketing?

523
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,080
How do you know that?

524
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,510
Your staff card?

525
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,020
Did you have a sneak peek at it?

526
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,930
Sorry, it just caught my attention.

527
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,750
So we're good then.

528
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,160
Yeah.

529
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,030
Are you in a hurry?

530
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,520
Yeah, I have to work on an assignment
from my new manager.

531
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,440
Can I help you?

532
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,290
No, thanks.

533
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:25,120
I can do it on my own.

534
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,960
It's just about
explaining my job description.

535
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,390
Everyone in the department,

536
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:41,360
especially old employees,
are really afraid of this manager.

537
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:46,890
Why?

538
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,720
They said he is...

539
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:50,950
Stern.

540
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,010
Like a woodpecker.

541
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,790
They say he just smells nice
and looks good.

542
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,960
He orders like a sergeant.

543
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,900
What a jerk!

544
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,560
Everyone in the department just hates him.

545
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,540
They said they don't like him at all.

546
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,690
And do you believe that?

547
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,330
I think it's really normal,

548
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,450
especially the job description assignment.

549
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:26,680
It reflects how he is concerned
about work flow.

550
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,990
I don't think he's the right fit
for the work culture at Jian Group

551
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,180
where it's full of seniority.

552
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,090
I'm talking too much again.

553
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,700
So excuse me.

554
00:29:44,111 --> 00:29:44,781
How much is that?

555
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,710
That's fine. It was on me.

556
00:29:48,357 --> 00:29:51,967
Take it as my atonement for
making you miss out on the croissant.

557
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,160
Thank you.

558
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:57,000
So let me treat you next time.

559
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:57,950
Yes, please.

560
00:29:59,405 --> 00:30:00,315
Excuse me.

561
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,820
Hey, Pat.

562
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:24,830
Ae,

563
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:25,580
What?

564
00:30:26,094 --> 00:30:29,064
I was so freaking mind blown
with his smile.

565
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,470
So did you ask his name already?

566
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,060
No,

567
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:35,940
I didn't.

568
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:40,330
He's so tall and gentleman-like.

569
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,720
He looks so wealthy with just a shirt.

570
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,760
OK, let me interrupt you.

571
00:30:50,132 --> 00:30:52,292
What? About the man?

572
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,050
Yeah, you're not wrong.

573
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,840
You tell him, he looks out of it.

574
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:57,790
Pat.

575
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,320
Pat.

576
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,980
Go for it.

577
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:03,980
You have nothing to lose.

578
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,700
At least, you just lose your face.

579
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,190
You see my hubby?

580
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,770
What? What are you talking about me again?

581
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,780
It's not that easy.

582
00:31:14,435 --> 00:31:17,510
And now I don't want a relationship.

583
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,170
I'm afraid I'll be hurt

584
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,310
and lose myself again.

585
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,620
And I've just begun my work life
and got nothing for myself.

586
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,620
Oh, boy.

587
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,770
Kanun, give him a lesson.

588
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,760
Pat, you're still young.

589
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,970
You can always stand
up again after you fall.

590
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,370
And when it comes to love,

591
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,700
Just take it to the fullest.

592
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,470
Sis, I'm 25 now,

593
00:31:44,926 --> 00:31:47,846
and I'll be 30 in the next few years.
I'm getting old.

594
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:49,585
Hey, don't talking about getting old.

595
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,350
30 years of age is not old!

596
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,870
It's thirty, flirty and thriving!
Look as us all!

597
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:56,700
Hey, Pat.

598
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:00,210
If you think you're old,
you just have to be quick, stop avoiding it.

599
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:03,230
And if you get a rich guy,
it's such a fast track.

600
00:32:03,777 --> 00:32:06,337
Woah! You're getting over your head.

601
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,220
I'm not that kind of person.

602
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,730
But you've been obsessed
over this guy for days, Pat.

603
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,380
You like him. Look at your reaction.

604
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,180
No, he's just professional,

605
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,370
so I just wanna work with him.

606
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,330
I'm not talking to you now.

607
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:25,770
- You like him.
- You're just all about him.

608
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,840
- Just tell me.
- I'm going too. What a waste of time. Bye.

609
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:47,440
I'm sorry.

610
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:48,800
I'm really sorry.

611
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,200
That's fine. I can just wipe it off.

612
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,750
I was really clumsy.

613
00:32:58,432 --> 00:32:59,992
Is your shoe all right?

614
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,140
It's leather.

615
00:33:02,775 --> 00:33:05,555
Actually it's very durable.
That's why many people wear leather shoes.

616
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,980
So, excuse me.

617
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,140
Let me carry it for you.

618
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,410
- You've got so much stuff there.
- That's fine.

619
00:33:27,954 --> 00:33:28,594
I'm sorry.

620
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,390
For what?

621
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,020
Nothing.

622
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,660
Let's go then. They're melting.

623
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,420
Yeah.

624
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,440
Hello, everyone

625
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,410
and anyone that isn't here.

626
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,240
Hey!

627
00:34:14,338 --> 00:34:17,678
I'm just kidding.

628
00:34:17,748 --> 00:34:19,508
Welcome to the party!

629
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:25,280
Welcome to the retirement party
for Wirun, our cool manager.

630
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,310
Welcome on stage.

631
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,090
Thank you, thank you.

632
00:34:29,357 --> 00:34:31,017
In the past year,

633
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,600
I would say that
I've been freaking sick of it!

634
00:34:35,725 --> 00:34:36,755
Joy kill.

635
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,120
Freaking joy kill.

636
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,330
I ask you one thing after I leave.

637
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,260
Don't make your new manager say
that I trained you poorly.

638
00:34:45,385 --> 00:34:49,295
Don't worry, Wirun. Rest in peace.

639
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,380
Hey! I'm still alive!

640
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,920
- He's still alive!
- Just out, just out.

641
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,890
No, I mean, have a good rest.

642
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:57,540
- Ahhhh.
- It's like,

643
00:34:57,942 --> 00:34:59,485
where do you think you come from, Jeng?

644
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,490
If he refers to you in that way, Wirun,

645
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,240
I...

646
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:08,310
- How?
- I'll protect you myself!

647
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,110
Thank you, Ying.
You're the most mature one here.

648
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:18,150
But before protecting someone else,

649
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,220
you must be great,

650
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,650
you must be the real deal.

651
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,660
Don't just be mature by age.

652
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,810
I just fell off my chair.

653
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:27,480
Anyway,

654
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:31,860
the leader for this company
should be already well selected.

655
00:35:32,376 --> 00:35:33,456
Our Jian Group isn't nothing...

656
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:36,801
it should be great and powerful!

657
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:39,030
It's all because of your support.

658
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,650
- I've got some motivation now!
- Enough, enough,

659
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,110
before I ruin the vibe.

660
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,770
I'm just gonna start with the first song.

661
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,250
What song will he sing as an old soul?

662
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,570
Prem, a 90s song!

663
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,860
You go, man!

664
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,620
Applaud!

665
00:35:57,365 --> 00:35:58,410
(Ae: Where are you now?)

666
00:35:58,530 --> 00:35:59,980
(Ae: Come to Pearl &amp; Oliver, hurry)

667
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:01,360
So old.

668
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,060
Freaking old.

669
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,300
(Ae: Where are you now?)

670
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:39,060
(Ae: Come to Pearl &amp; Oliver, hurry)

671
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,920
(Pat: I'll try to sneak out)

672
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,250
I am Ying!

673
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,290
Thank you.

674
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:51,740
Pat.

675
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,650
You know me?

676
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,210
What's up?

677
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,210
Why are you here alone?

678
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:06,870
I'm getting sleepy.

679
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,460
Really?

680
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,440
I'm shocked, you're sleepy now.

681
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,980
Are you crazy?

682
00:37:14,835 --> 00:37:19,435
You're still young!
Why are you sleepy now?

683
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,190
- Pat.
- Ying,

684
00:37:25,215 --> 00:37:28,455
I know you're tired,

685
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:32,203
if you hadn't helped
me, I would've just died.

686
00:37:33,205 --> 00:37:35,725
Tomorrow I have a presentation,

687
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:37,619
and there's some change in the content.

688
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,370
And when I inserted the information,
it messed the whole thing up.

689
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:42,800
So can you help me?

690
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:48,400
Translation and
layout, just a little bit.

691
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,770
Good boy.

692
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,000
My angel.

693
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,510
Just a little, please.

694
00:37:53,381 --> 00:37:54,855
(melodramatic wailing)

695
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,280
Pat, Pat!

696
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,110
OK.

697
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,190
What?

698
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,080
When do you need it?

699
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,330
Is 8 a.m. good?

700
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:07,240
Awww, don't make that face.
The presentation is at 10 a.m.

701
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,810
I need to prepare myself before that.

702
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:13,800
Tomorrow is Jeng's first day.

703
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,050
I don't want him to kill me.

704
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:18,270
Please, please, please, please.

705
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,430
You don't seem to enjoy the karaoke,

706
00:38:21,703 --> 00:38:24,823
so I think you should go back
and finish the work for me.

707
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:25,660
Go, Pat!

708
00:38:25,978 --> 00:38:28,578
Go home, Pat! And work for me!

709
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:32,080
Go! Go and work! 8 a.m. is good, right?

710
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,710
Thank you so much! Thank you so much!

711
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,420
Ying, are you all right?

712
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,210
- Ying, Ying!
- No!

713
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:42,620
I think I'm getting pregnant!

714
00:38:42,958 --> 00:38:44,868
I need to tell them inside about it!

715
00:38:46,109 --> 00:38:48,499
- Wait, Ying! Wait!
- Hey, I'm getting pregnant!

716
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:51,940
- Ying.
- I wish Pat all the best!

717
00:39:04,713 --> 00:39:05,493
I've arrived.

718
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:07,240
Where are you now?

719
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,050
We're already home!

720
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:11,090
Jarb was so drunk that he vomited,
and now he's fallen asleep.

721
00:39:12,114 --> 00:39:12,634
What?!

722
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,790
Jarb?!

723
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,180
Yeah, we were celebrating because

724
00:39:17,418 --> 00:39:19,788
the client who'd rejected
his work wanted it again.

725
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:29,490
Ae.

726
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:31,840
Sis.

727
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:33,930
What?

728
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,140
I saw that man in the restaurant.

729
00:39:36,785 --> 00:39:40,255
Oh! What're you waiting for?
Make a move on him before it's too late.

730
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,180
You might not see him ever again.

731
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,620
Jeng. Jeng.

732
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,370
Yeah.

733
00:39:49,715 --> 00:39:51,225
Are you coming back again today?

734
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,000
I don't think so.

735
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:57,440
So, please get the assignment
I gave you done in time.

736
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:58,970
Yes.

737
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,290
What's he doing here?

738
00:40:10,573 --> 00:40:12,683
Collecting trash?
This is a freaking restaurant, boy!

739
00:40:34,114 --> 00:40:36,324
You're really mature because
of your age like Wirun said.

740
00:40:37,261 --> 00:40:38,301
He just told you that,

741
00:40:38,974 --> 00:40:42,208
so how dare you still ask me to do your work?!
Or this is what makes you the real deal?

742
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:49,160
Urgh! Do I have to edit it
from the beginning?

743
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,580
I can't stand it every freaking day!

744
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,360
And I even have to translate it
into English.

745
00:41:01,491 --> 00:41:02,251
Who is it?

746
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:09,570
(Ying: Will I get my work
from you tonight, Pat?)

747
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:34,080
(P'Ying)

748
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,510
Shit! It's 7 a.m. already!

749
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,570
(Motorcycle driver: Where are you?)

750
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,500
Hello.

751
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:51,680
Hey.

752
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,490
My location is at the pin.

753
00:42:54,311 --> 00:42:56,611
Please follow the location.

754
00:42:58,305 --> 00:43:00,285
It's on Alley 3, Street 9.

755
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:00,810
Bro,

756
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:04,260
you just go 400 meters straight.

757
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:08,480
Bro, you have to make a turn at the Grandpa
&amp; Grandma Shrine, not the somtam restaurant.

758
00:43:09,223 --> 00:43:11,983
The Grandpa &amp; Grandma Shrine?
I see only a spirit house.

759
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:14,810
No, not a spirit house!

760
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:18,850
My house has a black gate here.

761
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:20,540
I'm just at the pin, bro.

762
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:22,050
Black gate?

763
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,950
Black gate here?

764
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

765
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,220
Give me a helmet.

766
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,630
Bro, I'll do it myself.

767
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:47,570
You never get the pin right!

768
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,510
How is that possible? Alley 3, Street 9.

769
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,520
I always ride around here.
I've never seen this place at all.

770
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:54,050
And why did you make a turn
at the somtam restaurant?

771
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:36,130
Stop checking the time!

772
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,440
It's just 10 minutes
before it's too late!

773
00:44:40,254 --> 00:44:40,624
Yes.

774
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:44,810
Give it to me now!
I have to go over it!

775
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:45,670
By the way,

776
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,300
the new manager
is waiting for you.

777
00:44:48,667 --> 00:44:49,627
Go and meet him now.

778
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:50,390
I'm sorry.

779
00:44:50,495 --> 00:44:53,235
Oh! Never mind! Go meet him!

780
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:10,250
His name is Jeng, but he's a jerk!

781
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,600
He makes us do a lot of work,

782
00:45:12,829 --> 00:45:14,879
and he lacks humanity.

783
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:18,900
And every word from his lips
is just nagging!

784
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:22,620
His good-looking face
doesn't help him at all,

785
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:26,190
- Yeah.
- Everyone in the department just hates him

786
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:29,857
and his father owns the company.
Mr.Tayukom Uttachiranun is his father.

787
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:40,450
(Kittipong Attjiranon)
(Digital Marketing Division Manager)

788
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:41,450
Excuse me.

789
00:45:43,954 --> 00:45:44,544
Please.

790
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:08,840
Hello,

791
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:21,200
we meet again.

792
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,960
(I don't know when I fell for you.)

793
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,110
(I definitely see you as more than a friend.)

794
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:41,880
(I wonder when did I start feeling like this.)

795
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,790
(All I can do is miss you but your face.)

796
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:45,970
(I see it in my dreams and I'm sleepwalking.)

797
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,650
(Before I knew it, I'd fallen for you.)

798
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:54,140
(I wanted to fall in love with you step by step
but it took me by surprise.)

799
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:57,520
(I can't stop myself from loving you.)

800
00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:00,750
(In my heart,
it says every time that only you.)

801
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:03,520
(I love you every single day.)

802
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,210
(Next Episode)
He did it like this.

803
00:47:07,609 --> 00:47:11,279
Because I've always been the one
who cleans them up.

804
00:47:11,791 --> 00:47:14,831
Professional working slides
for all the previous meetings.

805
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:18,370
I think you should be more calm.

806
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:20,110
And learn to control your temper.

807
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:22,610
Like a person with maturity
They do it.

808
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:29,840
Why don't I know
that Pat has returned to Thailand?

809
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:51,510
(A-T-L-A-S to the beat)

810
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,610
(It seems that you're afraid.)

811
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:59,970
(But my heart is starting to pound.)

812
00:48:00,543 --> 00:48:02,293
(The closer I get to you, )

813
00:48:02,726 --> 00:48:06,886
(The more my heart starts to tremble.)

814
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:12,120
(All the things I say,
But my heart wants to say I love you.)

815
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:16,460
(I command you to do so many things.
It'd be nice if I could command you to love me.)

816
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,740
(It'd be too hard to slowly fall for you.)

817
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:23,430
(My love for you only increases step by step.)

818
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:27,475
(I don't know when I fell for you.)

819
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,850
(I definitely see you as more than a friend.)

820
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:33,420
(I wonder when did I start feeling like this.)

821
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:34,750
(All I can do is miss...)
