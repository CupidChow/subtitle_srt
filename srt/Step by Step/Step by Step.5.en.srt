1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,518
Can I ask you something?
Why did you still decide to let me lead this project?

2
00:00:04,518 --> 00:00:08,700
I'm putting a lot of pressure on you,
because I see how competent you are.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,128
You have to trust yourself like I trust you.

4
00:00:12,128 --> 00:00:14,405
(Jeng: The Forge project has been approved.
We can make an appointment with a production house now.)

5
00:00:14,405 --> 00:00:16,172
Jaab, are you going home today?

6
00:00:16,172 --> 00:00:17,227
Yes.

7
00:00:17,227 --> 00:00:18,976
Ah, could you bring this home to mom?

8
00:00:18,976 --> 00:00:20,001
Always making me do stuff for him.

9
00:00:20,424 --> 00:00:21,055
Pat.

10
00:00:21,716 --> 00:00:22,785
Put? What are you doing here?

11
00:00:22,785 --> 00:00:24,917
I want to see you again,
Can you give me another chance?

12
00:00:24,917 --> 00:00:27,026
Our relationship has been over for 2 years.

13
00:00:27,844 --> 00:00:29,297
Put, please don't do this.

14
00:00:30,837 --> 00:00:34,151
These are the talents that Fjord requested.

15
00:00:34,151 --> 00:00:36,783
I've contacted all three of the talents,

16
00:00:36,783 --> 00:00:40,833
and we're currently in the middle of checking their schedules,
and negotiating the contracts.

17
00:00:49,071 --> 00:00:50,797
They are Boy Love actors?

18
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:57,185
Yes, Boy Love actors have a large fan base.

19
00:00:57,185 --> 00:01:02,600
I was thinking that this could pull in a lot of teenage fanclubs.

20
00:01:03,532 --> 00:01:06,025
I don't think that's necessary.

21
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:07,778
I think that...

22
00:01:07,778 --> 00:01:10,937
Jaab, which bl couple do you think best fits our project?

23
00:01:11,546 --> 00:01:14,969
For me, I'd recommend Zee and Nunew.

24
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:18,668
But their rate is quite high and their schedules are really tight.

25
00:01:19,065 --> 00:01:19,696
Ahh.

26
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:24,546
As for Nut and Plan,
their selling point is not really being shipped.

27
00:01:24,704 --> 00:01:28,675
Their fans are quite niche.

28
00:01:29,185 --> 00:01:31,897
Could you tell me, what is selling ship?

29
00:01:32,253 --> 00:01:39,126
Ah, um. Well, BL couples are just like male and female stars,

30
00:01:39,126 --> 00:01:41,456
they have to go to a lot of events,

31
00:01:41,456 --> 00:01:45,731
and act like they are secretly dating.

32
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,357
Honestly I don't really follow
the entertainment industry or celebrities.

33
00:01:50,357 --> 00:01:55,325
But do you really think your idea is ok?

34
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:57,562
Well, it's their job sir.

35
00:01:57,562 --> 00:02:00,001
It's quite different.

36
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:07,438
BL couples profit off the identity of the LGBTQ community.

37
00:02:17,731 --> 00:02:18,472
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:22,222
Hmmm, it's not that big of a deal.

39
00:02:22,222 --> 00:02:24,067
Remember, love wins!

40
00:02:24,308 --> 00:02:27,950
Love is a beautiful thing and it wins, right sir?

41
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,450
Yes.

42
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,780
I'd recommend Put and Kris,

43
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,101
their ques line up,

44
00:02:34,101 --> 00:02:36,422
and they've just finished shooting a series.

45
00:02:37,018 --> 00:02:39,018
Are there any other options?

46
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:47,340
Or should we try celebrity couples or celebrities that aren't BL?

47
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:54,242
If we try setting them up,
we might start a trend and create a new couple.

48
00:02:55,227 --> 00:02:59,557
We don't have that much time because it's a short campaign.

49
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:02,932
Choose one that's in trend right now.

50
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,771
From the choices, I think...

51
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:13,700
Put and Kris is the best choice, don't you think so?

52
00:03:20,413 --> 00:03:21,537
I agree.

53
00:03:32,028 --> 00:03:34,028
I think we should arrange a date for them to come in

54
00:03:34,768 --> 00:03:36,275
and go over the contract.

55
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,730
Mr. Jeng, you're incredible.

56
00:03:39,994 --> 00:03:41,994
This is going to work wonders for us.

57
00:04:47,148 --> 00:04:52,001
Of course you can do it Pat! You're a fighter!

58
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:53,563
I believe in you!

59
00:04:53,563 --> 00:04:58,936
Oh gosh, me? Who can I supervise over?

60
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,943
Have some confidence!

61
00:05:02,398 --> 00:05:05,876
Even if I go with you, it's still your job.

62
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:10,805
Ah, well? What is it? Let me take a look.

63
00:05:11,484 --> 00:05:15,564
First off, I have to check shots and blockings.

64
00:05:15,564 --> 00:05:18,013
And if the mood and tone
is not in line with the brand's CI.

65
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:21,186
I also have to check
if there's no problem with the location.

66
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:22,827
After it's released to the public.

67
00:05:22,827 --> 00:05:26,162
I have to reserve a restaurant
even though it's not my job at all.

68
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:30,000
Ah, you're right.

69
00:05:30,193 --> 00:05:32,193
But the budget is so small.

70
00:05:32,193 --> 00:05:34,427
And if Mr. Jeng didn't help pay,

71
00:05:34,427 --> 00:05:36,465
you'd probably have to check the location
in only one day and come back!

72
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,680
A company project that the owner's kid is paying for.

73
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,733
And also gets money from the company?

74
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:50,256
Yeah, and he also hired his brother.

75
00:05:50,626 --> 00:05:55,199
If this was another company, would this be considered fraud?

76
00:05:56,888 --> 00:05:58,560
Don't say another word.

77
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:00,784
Geez, all of you.

78
00:06:01,146 --> 00:06:03,474
Krit, give Pat some encouragement!

79
00:06:03,474 --> 00:06:04,673
You can do it Pat!

80
00:06:05,255 --> 00:06:06,270
Thank you.

81
00:06:06,848 --> 00:06:08,465
Come over here Krit.

82
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,380
Give me your hand.

83
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:12,375
Hold hands.

84
00:06:12,823 --> 00:06:14,057
Repeat after me.

85
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:15,679
I can do it.

86
00:06:15,848 --> 00:06:17,191
I can do it.

87
00:06:17,191 --> 00:06:18,248
I can do it!

88
00:06:18,248 --> 00:06:19,383
I can do it!!

89
00:06:19,383 --> 00:06:22,543
You should be the loudest one, not us!

90
00:06:23,035 --> 00:06:24,311
I can do it!

91
00:06:24,328 --> 00:06:25,671
I can do it!!

92
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:27,901
Good, that's more like it.

93
00:06:49,264 --> 00:06:52,414
(Chot: I'm so sorry again for not going,
but where are you?)

94
00:06:59,182 --> 00:07:02,003
(Pat: In front of the building,
waiting for Jay Production House to pick me up.)

95
00:07:02,003 --> 00:07:04,414
(Chot: You can do it, easy peasy the first time!)

96
00:07:06,983 --> 00:07:08,217
Easy?

97
00:07:25,158 --> 00:07:27,705
Please let my first job go easy.

98
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,064
Hello Jen.

99
00:07:49,064 --> 00:07:49,866
Hi Jaab.

100
00:07:59,441 --> 00:08:01,934
How are you Pat?
Were you waiting for long?

101
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:03,475
Not long at all.

102
00:08:07,793 --> 00:08:09,136
Are we there yet?

103
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:14,699
Oh, Pat... We're not there yet.

104
00:08:15,191 --> 00:08:16,260
Hi Jaab.

105
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,357
You don't need to say hi, he's talking in his sleep.

106
00:08:24,315 --> 00:08:26,315
Where's Kanoon?

107
00:08:26,396 --> 00:08:28,400
Kanoon? There!

108
00:08:29,048 --> 00:08:31,048
Sleeping and wrapped like a Mummy back there.

109
00:08:35,284 --> 00:08:37,284
So you're on your own today?

110
00:08:37,947 --> 00:08:38,743
Yes.

111
00:08:39,331 --> 00:08:40,455
Please go easy on me.

112
00:08:41,441 --> 00:08:43,988
What? We're here to help each other.

113
00:08:44,837 --> 00:08:48,260
It's ok, I've carefully planned this out.

114
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:53,040
Did you get the work schedule that I sent you?

115
00:08:53,518 --> 00:08:55,518
Ah, I got it.

116
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:59,393
But can I change it a bit?

117
00:08:59,774 --> 00:09:02,267
Could we stop at a Fjord gas station first?

118
00:09:02,267 --> 00:09:04,192
Because there's such limited time.

119
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:05,443
Ummm...

120
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:06,920
We can't.

121
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,709
Look at your face! I'm kidding!
Of course we can.

122
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:16,701
Excuse me, we'll stop at a Fjord gas station
as our first location and then we'll go to the next location.

123
00:09:18,701 --> 00:09:19,606
All done.

124
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:21,760
Thank you.

125
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,559
It's ok, it's not serious.

126
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,595
Thank you.

127
00:09:35,225 --> 00:09:42,043
(Jeng: Have you left yet?)

128
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:44,814
(Pat: Yes.)

129
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,283
Jeng, do you know what gets on my nerves
when we're on the drive?

130
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:33,116
What?

131
00:10:34,402 --> 00:10:36,183
Things that we can't control.

132
00:10:38,148 --> 00:10:40,148
It bothers me so much.

133
00:10:42,314 --> 00:10:43,548
What are you trying to say?

134
00:10:45,673 --> 00:10:47,235
You really are my son.

135
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:50,997
It's nothing, I'm just saying things.

136
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:56,264
Are you trying to get me the management side?

137
00:11:02,991 --> 00:11:06,250
There's already 3 independent directors.

138
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,000
I just want you to really step in.

139
00:11:13,343 --> 00:11:15,124
It might be 2-3 years.

140
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:22,078
I thought it'd be like this!
Ordering the weather around is easier than you!

141
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:26,569
You're still fit and strong, I don't see the rush.

142
00:11:32,477 --> 00:11:33,765
Do you understand?

143
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,709
Jian Group's image right now is old men,

144
00:11:37,977 --> 00:11:39,440
that are just salesmen.

145
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:42,110
Buy and sell.

146
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,500
It's not modern.

147
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,411
It's not hip.

148
00:11:45,635 --> 00:11:50,756
People think that I have monopolized the whole country.

149
00:11:53,176 --> 00:11:56,490
Isn't it true?
What you're doing right now?

150
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,802
I'm already up high, how do you expect me to step down?

151
00:12:03,801 --> 00:12:07,827
So you want me to rebrand Jian Group?

152
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:10,000
What do you think?

153
00:12:11,577 --> 00:12:15,548
If you expect me to abandon the Digital department,
it's not happening any time soon.

154
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,364
This is the department that I established.

155
00:12:18,865 --> 00:12:22,080
It's been so many years,
yet there has not been any work to prove.

156
00:12:23,092 --> 00:12:26,560
It's like what I told you, I don't have 2-3 years for you.

157
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:30,724
If nothing happens by the end of this year,
then it's as promised.

158
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:35,870
Jian Group has the money
to hire an outsourced team to work immediately.

159
00:12:47,855 --> 00:12:48,870
Nope.

160
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,522
I'm still your dad.

161
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,840
Have some porridge.

162
00:13:26,996 --> 00:13:28,120
Careful, it's hot.

163
00:13:34,903 --> 00:13:35,863
Be careful.

164
00:13:35,863 --> 00:13:39,029
It's just a bad stomach.

165
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:40,283
I'm just worried.

166
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:45,709
Let the doctor see if your fever has gone down.

167
00:13:47,155 --> 00:13:49,155
It's fine there,

168
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:50,932
but something's wrong here.

169
00:14:13,907 --> 00:14:16,454
Mr. Jeng!!

170
00:14:18,073 --> 00:14:19,361
Can we get back to it?

171
00:14:20,435 --> 00:14:22,200
I think you should pick up first.

172
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,666
In case there's something important.

173
00:14:26,174 --> 00:14:29,726
Mr. Jeng has really got his timing messed up.

174
00:14:29,726 --> 00:14:30,501
Come on.

175
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,386
Hello?

176
00:14:35,386 --> 00:14:36,440
Chot.

177
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,218
How is Pat doing?

178
00:14:39,147 --> 00:14:42,899
Oh, he's told me that they are at the first location.

179
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:46,320
Is there a problem?

180
00:14:47,373 --> 00:14:48,771
Just a second Mr. Jeng.

181
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:59,080
It seems like there's a location that Fjord doesn't like.

182
00:14:59,311 --> 00:15:02,800
But I don't think there's a problem,
because we have to decide again anyway.

183
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,226
I think it's because of Jaab.

184
00:15:08,185 --> 00:15:10,185
I think I'll follow them.

185
00:15:10,834 --> 00:15:13,710
But it's a really small issue Mr. Jeng.

186
00:15:14,778 --> 00:15:18,694
I'm worried about Pat,
I'm scared that he won't be able to handle this.

187
00:15:19,242 --> 00:15:23,596
Ah, but I think the problem would be over when you get there.

188
00:15:23,596 --> 00:15:28,343
And didn't you say that
Pat would be able to handle this on his own?

189
00:15:32,547 --> 00:15:35,860
Um, I know that you're worried Mr. Jeng.

190
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,519
And I can't really stop you.

191
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,503
Do what you think is needed.

192
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:44,119
Ok, then I'll head out right now.

193
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,090
He just hung up on me!

194
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,580
It seems like Mr. Jeng,

195
00:15:56,953 --> 00:15:59,008
is really worried about Pat.

196
00:15:59,254 --> 00:16:03,170
Of course he is, I'm in the hospital
and he doesn't even ask how I am!

197
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:07,873
What would you want him to be worried about you?

198
00:16:08,806 --> 00:16:10,400
You have me.

199
00:16:11,341 --> 00:16:13,800
You keep saying stuff like this.

200
00:16:17,317 --> 00:16:19,098
I also want to promise that.

201
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:21,714
I'm going to take care of you forever.

202
00:16:22,921 --> 00:16:26,680
Hmmm, why are you speaking like you're in a movie?

203
00:16:38,755 --> 00:16:40,000
Krit.

204
00:16:53,616 --> 00:16:55,616
We might only be able to exchange rings.

205
00:16:56,814 --> 00:16:58,814
Promises are just words,

206
00:17:02,418 --> 00:17:04,418
but it's really important to me.

207
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,889
Are you going to be with me until we're old and grey?

208
00:17:11,691 --> 00:17:12,596
Hmmm?

209
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:15,751
What?

210
00:17:16,013 --> 00:17:17,760
Sure.

211
00:17:21,605 --> 00:17:22,893
Promise?

212
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,162
You can't break this promise!

213
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,518
Krit!

214
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,080
No, don't cry.

215
00:17:46,405 --> 00:17:49,062
Why are you like this?

216
00:17:58,325 --> 00:17:58,825
How is it?

217
00:17:58,825 --> 00:17:59,347
Good.

218
00:17:59,347 --> 00:18:00,000
Is it nice?
It's awesome!

219
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,881
Very nice.

220
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:04,398
Pat?

221
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:08,280
As for this location, we still can't give you an answer.

222
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:11,134
Because the clients have been very clear.

223
00:18:11,134 --> 00:18:14,476
That we can only use locations in our list.

224
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:18,556
But this is owned by Fjord.

225
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,640
And another thing is, it has everything we need.

226
00:18:23,891 --> 00:18:27,479
I think this location is better suited for the film.

227
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:32,914
It really shows our message
of really getting to the right places.

228
00:18:32,914 --> 00:18:33,890
Umm.

229
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:37,093
It's not that.

230
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,452
Another thing, on the side of image building.

231
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,019
We want people to see how big Fjord is.

232
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:46,361
Especially here Fjord's competitors like Petrothai.

233
00:18:46,361 --> 00:18:48,645
When they use various branches in their film.

234
00:18:48,645 --> 00:18:53,400
They only choose flagship branches only, it looks grand.

235
00:18:53,912 --> 00:19:00,456
Um, but Ms. Aim,
the places you gave me are really difficult to film.

236
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:04,750
Well, I'm afraid that if we don't control it,
we'll take more time than we should.

237
00:19:05,325 --> 00:19:08,256
We won't if we manage it well.

238
00:19:08,502 --> 00:19:11,706
Another thing is, Jen is a great producer.

239
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,553
I think this small thing won't become a problem, right?

240
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,099
As someone who has been a
Director of Photography for a long time.

241
00:19:21,468 --> 00:19:24,453
I've shot films with TTB a few times.

242
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:28,178
I like this branch best, it's really cinematic.

243
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,972
It's accessible and doesn't look like you're showing off.

244
00:19:34,604 --> 00:19:36,549
I kind of agree with you,

245
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:38,921
and I really understand the cinematic aspect.

246
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:44,304
But it's not enough of a reason to make us

247
00:19:44,304 --> 00:19:47,501
change from a grand branch to this small one.

248
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:05,451
What's the matter, Mr. Jeng?

249
00:20:05,908 --> 00:20:07,361
(I'm on my way to see you.)

250
00:20:08,445 --> 00:20:09,679
(Is everything ok?)

251
00:20:12,246 --> 00:20:13,370
It's going well.

252
00:20:21,698 --> 00:20:23,698
(Where are you? I'm going to see you.)

253
00:20:23,698 --> 00:20:25,150
Ah.

254
00:20:28,156 --> 00:20:30,539
We're almost done here.

255
00:20:31,173 --> 00:20:35,034
Should we meet up at the hotel?

256
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:35,861
That's not great.

257
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:37,062
Going there is not good.

258
00:20:38,495 --> 00:20:39,674
(Are you sure?)

259
00:20:41,047 --> 00:20:42,281
Yes.

260
00:20:43,695 --> 00:20:45,531
I have to go now.

261
00:20:52,647 --> 00:20:54,264
Jen, what should we do?

262
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,334
I don't know,
it's really hard to control Jaab.

263
00:20:58,873 --> 00:21:02,187
He's Jian Group's son so he thinks,
he can get everything he wants.

264
00:21:03,014 --> 00:21:03,700
Look.

265
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,621
I think I know what to do.

266
00:21:14,353 --> 00:21:16,560
I think we're wasting time here.

267
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:22,560
Aim, I think we should talk about this in the meeting room.

268
00:21:23,168 --> 00:21:27,600
Because I understand that you don't hold the power
to make decisions.

269
00:21:29,961 --> 00:21:33,275
This is a campaign between Fjord and Jian Group.

270
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:36,800
I think we should come to a conclusion.

271
00:21:41,477 --> 00:21:45,886
Umm... Aim, I think this is all for today.

272
00:21:45,886 --> 00:21:48,901
Because we've got all the photos, it's going to get dark soon.

273
00:21:48,901 --> 00:21:50,907
I think you have to return to Bangkok.

274
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:52,749
It's true...

275
00:21:53,315 --> 00:21:54,494
Then I think that...

276
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:59,086
We should collect all the information
and talk in the meeting room again, it's better, right?

277
00:21:59,086 --> 00:22:00,401
We'll arrange another meeting.

278
00:22:00,717 --> 00:22:02,480
Thank you so much for today.

279
00:22:03,237 --> 00:22:04,580
Thank you.

280
00:22:28,111 --> 00:22:29,454
(Chonburi, Thailand)

281
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:06,914
I'm sorry.

282
00:23:06,914 --> 00:23:11,567
It's just that the air conditioning room is broken
after the customer has just checked out in the afternoon.

283
00:23:11,567 --> 00:23:16,722
In any case, we will quickly find a hotel or find a room nearby.

284
00:23:16,722 --> 00:23:19,639
Hmm, is there no other room?

285
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:22,165
Uh, now the rooms are full.

286
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,382
What's wrong, Jen?

287
00:23:36,577 --> 00:23:39,234
Well, now we're missing a room.

288
00:23:39,234 --> 00:23:41,867
It's just that the employee informed me that
the air conditioner was broken.

289
00:23:42,443 --> 00:23:45,209
There must be someone going to sleep at a hotel nearby.

290
00:23:45,481 --> 00:23:51,423
Oh, then we can go sleep somewhere else.
Let the team rest first.

291
00:23:51,423 --> 00:23:52,162
That's fine.

292
00:23:54,086 --> 00:23:55,800
Is it possible to check one more time?

293
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,355
Sure.

294
00:23:56,355 --> 00:23:59,092
It's okay, we sleep somewhere else.

295
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:02,040
We have already booked it.

296
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,503
It's broken.

297
00:24:03,938 --> 00:24:04,898
It's okay.

298
00:24:04,898 --> 00:24:06,485
Is there an air conditioner technician?

299
00:24:08,422 --> 00:24:10,000
Did you just arrive at the hotel?

300
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,814
Uh, it's just that...

301
00:24:14,814 --> 00:24:15,882
Is there a problem?

302
00:24:17,202 --> 00:24:20,120
Well, now we are missing a room.

303
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,330
Well, the staff informed me that
the air conditioner was broken.

304
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:26,926
But we can find a hotel nearby.

305
00:24:28,254 --> 00:24:31,960
The president suite room, 5th floor,
did you hold it for me or not?

306
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,430
Just a moment.

307
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:38,080
It's the only room left.

308
00:24:38,474 --> 00:24:39,600
Please hold it for me.

309
00:24:40,304 --> 00:24:40,935
Of course.

310
00:24:43,756 --> 00:24:46,468
Pat, you'll be sleeping in the same room as me.

311
00:24:47,317 --> 00:24:48,760
There's only one room left.

312
00:24:54,823 --> 00:24:56,987
It seems like it has to be like that.

313
00:26:05,256 --> 00:26:06,480
I'm all done.

314
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,385
Ah.

315
00:26:09,288 --> 00:26:10,000
Ok.

316
00:26:11,261 --> 00:26:12,604
I'll go shower now.

317
00:26:14,141 --> 00:26:14,991
Sure.

318
00:26:50,578 --> 00:26:54,001
When we reach the aquarium,
I'm going to have the protagonist

319
00:26:54,765 --> 00:26:56,765
slowly reach out,

320
00:26:57,394 --> 00:26:59,668
like he's trying to cross over and grab something.

321
00:27:00,246 --> 00:27:02,137
Are you hallucinating?

322
00:27:02,845 --> 00:27:03,553
Like,

323
00:27:04,614 --> 00:27:06,400
he's like trying to grasp the meaning of life.

324
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:11,105
But there's nothing.

325
00:27:13,488 --> 00:27:15,440
And what will people who see it understand?

326
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,422
This is an advertisement,

327
00:27:18,193 --> 00:27:19,317
not a philosophical drama.

328
00:27:19,317 --> 00:27:23,426
Wow, you're always raining on my parade.

329
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:33,137
Or... would it be like the two of them
touching each other's hands?

330
00:27:35,907 --> 00:27:37,414
But they live in different periods of time

331
00:27:38,758 --> 00:27:41,908
and then actually touch each other at the Fjord gas station.

332
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:48,825
Like this?

333
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:25,969
But they aren't really touching, right?

334
00:28:26,728 --> 00:28:28,400
Because they are in different times.

335
00:28:29,534 --> 00:28:30,494
It's a shame.

336
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,080
Yes.

337
00:28:42,675 --> 00:28:43,471
What do you think?

338
00:28:45,561 --> 00:28:47,123
Hey.

339
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:51,600
Wait.

340
00:28:52,071 --> 00:28:53,195
Mon is calling.

341
00:29:00,819 --> 00:29:02,217
Mon, hello?

342
00:29:08,593 --> 00:29:09,720
We're at the hotel.

343
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,348
Everything is fine.

344
00:29:12,593 --> 00:29:14,593
We've had dinner, what about you?

345
00:29:16,324 --> 00:29:18,160
We're going back to Bangkok soon.

346
00:29:19,293 --> 00:29:20,855
You're so good at calling me to go back.

347
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,253
It's almost midnight.

348
00:29:53,173 --> 00:29:55,173
Don't you have an early morning?

349
00:29:57,947 --> 00:29:59,235
You can sleep on the bed.

350
00:30:00,001 --> 00:30:02,713
I'll sleep on the sofa.

351
00:30:03,379 --> 00:30:06,720
Oh, your back will hurt from sleeping on the sofa.

352
00:30:07,513 --> 00:30:08,418
Uh.

353
00:30:10,306 --> 00:30:14,715
You can sleep on the bed with me, it's more comfortable.

354
00:30:19,506 --> 00:30:20,800
It's fine.

355
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,060
Uh.

356
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:39,800
I'll just turn off my computer first.

357
00:30:41,357 --> 00:30:42,262
Sure.

358
00:31:56,249 --> 00:31:58,961
I'm so sorry for bothering you today.

359
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,345
Go to sleep.

360
00:32:04,317 --> 00:32:05,934
We have work in the morning.

361
00:32:13,572 --> 00:32:14,587
Ok.

362
00:34:54,321 --> 00:34:55,883
Pat! Stop! Pat!

363
00:34:56,212 --> 00:34:57,227
Hey, Put!!

364
00:34:58,925 --> 00:35:00,000
No!

365
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:02,102
Put!

366
00:35:04,481 --> 00:35:05,167
Take that!

367
00:35:05,761 --> 00:35:06,355
Take that!

368
00:35:10,161 --> 00:35:11,395
Are you tired?

369
00:35:11,935 --> 00:35:12,950
No, I'm not.

370
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,018
You're always teasing me like that.

371
00:35:44,018 --> 00:35:45,252
Is there something wrong?

372
00:35:46,008 --> 00:35:47,296
How can I not love you?

373
00:36:38,902 --> 00:36:40,000
"Group, it's change, not salary."

374
00:36:44,092 --> 00:36:46,968
(Beam: Do you have covid?)

375
00:36:56,604 --> 00:37:02,217
(Ae: I'm pregnant.)

376
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,139
(Beam: Huh?)

377
00:37:14,729 --> 00:37:16,729
(Ae: It's true.)

378
00:37:24,338 --> 00:37:25,760
(Ae: It's true.)

379
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,260
(Beam : Congrats Mama.)

380
00:39:39,641 --> 00:39:40,984
Are you awake?

381
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:46,726
Yes.

382
00:39:48,447 --> 00:39:49,681
Let's eat.

383
00:39:50,482 --> 00:39:54,781
Uh, I'm going to take a shower first.

384
00:39:55,943 --> 00:39:58,271
Come and eat first, it's going to get cold.

385
00:40:00,555 --> 00:40:01,515
Quickly.

386
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:05,800
Ah, fine.

387
00:40:07,753 --> 00:40:08,822
Just a moment.

388
00:40:32,618 --> 00:40:34,016
How did you sleep?

389
00:40:34,345 --> 00:40:35,840
Pretty well.

390
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,880
You can eat slowly.

391
00:41:01,144 --> 00:41:02,487
You might choke on it.

392
00:41:04,977 --> 00:41:06,539
Thank you.

393
00:41:11,701 --> 00:41:14,080
I don't think I can join you this morning.

394
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,852
I have a conference call with the Philippines.

395
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:20,191
So please post update photos in the group.

396
00:41:27,281 --> 00:41:28,022
Ok.

397
00:41:28,323 --> 00:41:32,130
Today we're going to check out
the location at Bang Saen beach.

398
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:33,114
The aquarium.

399
00:41:33,114 --> 00:41:34,622
The reservoir,

400
00:41:34,622 --> 00:41:36,112
and walking street.

401
00:41:36,465 --> 00:41:39,779
I think we're going to be moving around all day.

402
00:41:40,724 --> 00:41:44,320
But it's good that the Fjord team left.

403
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,720
I'll meet you in the afternoon.

404
00:41:49,015 --> 00:41:51,015
You can get in my car.

405
00:41:51,015 --> 00:41:55,440
Because on the way back, the production team will be able
to go straight back without going around to drop you off.

406
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,001
Don't worry, Mr. Jeng.
I can be dropped off at their office.

407
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:02,105
I think Jaab said he wanted to stick around to chill out.

408
00:42:04,943 --> 00:42:07,052
Anyway, you can go back with me.

409
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:11,405
I had no idea, nobody told me.

410
00:42:11,405 --> 00:42:12,837
They must have forgotten.

411
00:42:15,608 --> 00:42:19,141
Could you help me find a good seafood restaurant?

412
00:42:19,442 --> 00:42:22,482
On the way back,
I want to stop by and take the team out to eat.

413
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,160
Sure.

414
00:42:25,414 --> 00:42:26,480
Thank you.

415
00:42:46,561 --> 00:42:47,959
Huh?

416
00:42:49,009 --> 00:42:50,352
Ae is pregnant?

417
00:42:50,856 --> 00:42:51,960
Who?

418
00:42:52,227 --> 00:42:54,063
She's my...

419
00:42:54,841 --> 00:42:57,115
Ah, it's nothing.

420
00:42:58,004 --> 00:43:00,000
You don't know her.

421
00:43:01,396 --> 00:43:02,137
Ok.

422
00:43:02,243 --> 00:43:02,743
Ok.

423
00:43:10,668 --> 00:43:13,380
(Pat: Congrats Mama!!)

424
00:43:24,652 --> 00:43:25,667
I think it's around here.

425
00:43:25,667 --> 00:43:26,902
Is this a good spot?

426
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,844
I think it's good, I'll have Jaab and Kanoon check.

427
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,791
Uh, Kanoon! Should we try this spot?

428
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,343
This is good.

429
00:43:41,389 --> 00:43:43,608
Is there anyone who's as tall as the actor?

430
00:43:43,906 --> 00:43:45,906
Pat, could you stand there for me?

431
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,617
Good.

432
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,372
Jen, try moving to the left a bit.

433
00:43:56,611 --> 00:43:57,680
Pat, follow.

434
00:44:01,285 --> 00:44:03,230
Just a moment.

435
00:44:05,557 --> 00:44:07,557
I'm going to rehearse.

436
00:44:11,158 --> 00:44:12,118
Hello.

437
00:44:13,704 --> 00:44:18,600
(Pat? My team is firm about using the big branch.)

438
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,000
Huh?

439
00:44:21,106 --> 00:44:22,504
What?

440
00:44:23,562 --> 00:44:25,562
Just a moment.

441
00:44:27,143 --> 00:44:28,650
Jen, Jen!

442
00:44:31,244 --> 00:44:32,313
What?

443
00:44:32,313 --> 00:44:33,833
It's Aim from Fjord.

444
00:44:34,282 --> 00:44:35,570
Hello?

445
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:39,169
(Well, Forge Asia confirmed it,)

446
00:44:39,169 --> 00:44:42,345
(to use the specified branch.)

447
00:44:42,345 --> 00:44:48,796
(And maybe bother the Jay team to help make CG
to remove anything that is not beautiful.)

448
00:44:52,065 --> 00:44:54,941
It's not that easy, CG.

449
00:44:55,356 --> 00:45:00,477
(Singapore has confirmed
and I probably couldn't help anything.)

450
00:45:00,477 --> 00:45:05,421
(They saw the updated picture, it's not that different.)

451
00:45:05,421 --> 00:45:09,383
(Therefore, I think using the main branch
would be even better.)

452
00:45:10,225 --> 00:45:13,758
Oh well, I'll call you back.

453
00:45:18,727 --> 00:45:20,520
What should we do?

454
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,120
It's hard.

455
00:45:22,405 --> 00:45:26,360
Or should we completely do new block shots
and shoot them beautifully?

456
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:30,603
That is, if we do that,
we won't have time to block shot other places.

457
00:45:35,406 --> 00:45:36,720
Do you think it's necessary?

458
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:42,440
If it's me, I will do what the customer said
because he hired me.

459
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:46,920
But for Jaab, if he doesn't get what he want.

460
00:45:48,161 --> 00:45:52,351
It probably won't come out well
and he'll just do it like he doesn't want to.

461
00:45:52,871 --> 00:45:54,871
But I don't want it to be like that.

462
00:45:55,189 --> 00:45:56,861
It will affect our reputation.

463
00:45:57,427 --> 00:45:59,427
Do you think retaking the block shots,

464
00:46:00,347 --> 00:46:03,680
we'll be able to convince Fjord?

465
00:46:04,291 --> 00:46:10,000
If we can tell the story we want to tell and make it pretty,
I'd say we have a 70-80% chance.

466
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,389
What if we use the real actor to block shot?
They might like our idea.

467
00:46:15,388 --> 00:46:16,950
The actors?

468
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,573
Tell me

469
00:46:30,899 --> 00:46:32,406
that it's worthed.

470
00:46:35,529 --> 00:46:41,014
Pat, do you want this to turn out good?

471
00:47:04,313 --> 00:47:07,298
Put? Could you walk from this side?

472
00:47:07,298 --> 00:47:10,398
And then put your hand here, on this jar.

473
00:47:10,398 --> 00:47:10,898
Ok.

474
00:47:10,898 --> 00:47:13,622
And try to imagine you're placing your hands with Kris.

475
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,943
And your eyes lock, slowly.

476
00:47:15,943 --> 00:47:17,041
About that.

477
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:17,878
I think this is good.

478
00:47:17,878 --> 00:47:18,416
Ok.

479
00:47:18,416 --> 00:47:20,558
Ok, I'm going to hold this frame.

480
00:47:20,558 --> 00:47:21,058
Ok.

481
00:47:21,058 --> 00:47:21,989
Ah huh, Ok.

482
00:47:22,827 --> 00:47:24,061
I'm going to count now.

483
00:47:24,061 --> 00:47:25,194
Ok!

484
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:29,120
3...2...1, Action!

485
00:47:31,595 --> 00:47:32,610
Pat.

486
00:47:33,241 --> 00:47:35,022
Thank you so much.

487
00:47:35,022 --> 00:47:39,295
If it weren't for you,
Jaab would be on my tail for so many days.

488
00:47:39,295 --> 00:47:40,714
It's ok.

489
00:47:41,365 --> 00:47:43,320
I just hope that it's worthed.

490
00:47:44,453 --> 00:47:45,840
Is this ok, Jaab?

491
00:47:46,326 --> 00:47:48,326
That's perfect.

492
00:47:49,582 --> 00:47:50,980
Jen and Pat, take a look at this.

493
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,800
That's perfect.

494
00:47:56,292 --> 00:47:57,854
I think this will work.

495
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,000
If the clients aren't idiots.

496
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,771
It'd be so nice if Kris were here.

497
00:48:04,237 --> 00:48:06,894
See they can see how good they look together.

498
00:48:07,783 --> 00:48:12,794
Well, we'll have have Jen or Pat stand it.
I think they look pretty good.

499
00:48:13,521 --> 00:48:14,645
Jen?

500
00:48:14,645 --> 00:48:15,562
Yeah.

501
00:48:18,644 --> 00:48:20,000
I don't think so.

502
00:48:21,326 --> 00:48:23,326
I'm ok with Pat.

503
00:48:24,361 --> 00:48:25,868
We already know each other.

504
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:28,361
That's perfect!

505
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:31,672
Please help us Pat.

506
00:48:34,163 --> 00:48:35,680
Just this once.

507
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,045
Yeah.

508
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:38,995
There's only you left.

509
00:48:40,321 --> 00:48:41,520
Do you understand the brief?

510
00:48:41,911 --> 00:48:43,120
Can you tell me again?

511
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,976
Ah, Put knows it.

512
00:48:44,976 --> 00:48:46,678
Try to imagine that you're Kris.

513
00:48:46,955 --> 00:48:50,816
Put your hands together like that at the same time.

514
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:56,735
Then slowly lock eyes, give it some emotion.

515
00:48:58,057 --> 00:48:58,798
Ok?

516
00:48:59,661 --> 00:49:01,497
Most importantly, smile happily!

517
00:49:03,561 --> 00:49:04,904
You can do it Pat.

518
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:06,549
Put, let's give it another go.

519
00:49:06,549 --> 00:49:07,113
Sure.

520
00:49:07,113 --> 00:49:07,734
Come on.

521
00:49:10,001 --> 00:49:11,289
I'm going to count now.

522
00:49:11,289 --> 00:49:14,110
3...2...1, Action!

523
00:49:17,658 --> 00:49:19,001
That's good.

524
00:49:21,146 --> 00:49:22,434
Slowly.

525
00:49:25,388 --> 00:49:27,388
Ok, slowly.

526
00:49:32,103 --> 00:49:34,600
Hey Pat, make a better face.

527
00:49:35,049 --> 00:49:37,706
We got Put in our block shot!

528
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,925
Smile a bit wider!

529
00:49:47,598 --> 00:49:49,762
That's good.

530
00:49:49,762 --> 00:49:51,502
The chemistry is there.

531
00:49:51,677 --> 00:49:53,403
Lock eyes.

532
00:49:54,304 --> 00:49:55,800
Very good.

533
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,547
Jaab, take a look at it.

534
00:49:57,941 --> 00:49:59,503
I think it's great.

535
00:50:00,516 --> 00:50:02,735
I think the customer will say ok.

536
00:50:02,735 --> 00:50:03,803
Yeah.

537
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:07,890
You work hard.

538
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:10,211
Oh, you hired me to work!

539
00:50:10,211 --> 00:50:11,819
Keep working.

540
00:51:17,871 --> 00:51:20,528
(Aim: Put is so handsome!!)

541
00:51:20,528 --> 00:51:22,041
(Nadia : Put&Pat are so cute!)

542
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:23,689
(Aim : Agreeeeee!)

543
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,562
(Aim: I'm really shipping this,
can I be in your fan club?)

544
00:52:01,562 --> 00:52:05,072
This is definitely going to pass!

545
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,695
I can't say anything except my bro is the real one!

546
00:52:09,695 --> 00:52:12,269
Of course, I'm the best at photography.

547
00:52:12,584 --> 00:52:14,201
I meant Put.

548
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:16,989
Uh, but Put was really great.

549
00:52:16,989 --> 00:52:17,738
I'm not that good.

550
00:52:17,738 --> 00:52:19,677
Wow, the picture is really nice.

551
00:52:29,389 --> 00:52:30,568
Who is calling?

552
00:52:30,568 --> 00:52:31,413
Aim.

553
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:39,274
Hello.

554
00:52:39,274 --> 00:52:41,557
(Hi Handsome Pat!)

555
00:52:41,557 --> 00:52:45,605
(Can I be in your fan club?)

556
00:52:46,356 --> 00:52:52,024
(The team has already discussed that
they will bring this matter to the meeting with Marcom.)

557
00:52:52,024 --> 00:52:55,174
(But you may have to see that the branch we go to,)

558
00:52:55,174 --> 00:52:58,921
(how can we strategize to make the Fjord still look great?)

559
00:52:59,633 --> 00:53:00,800
Ah, ok.

560
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,495
And this one, can we get approved within the next week?

561
00:53:05,152 --> 00:53:07,918
Well, I don't want it to be any later.

562
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:13,195
(I think next week we should get the answer,
probably no problems.)

563
00:53:13,195 --> 00:53:16,958
(Because Ms. Nadia loves it so much.)

564
00:53:16,958 --> 00:53:18,834
Thank you very much.

565
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:20,967
Pass!

566
00:53:20,967 --> 00:53:23,789
Yay! Pass! Yay!

567
00:53:23,789 --> 00:53:25,481
Congratulations everyone.

568
00:53:25,481 --> 00:53:26,562
Put, thank you so much.

569
00:53:26,562 --> 00:53:27,247
It's fine.

570
00:53:27,247 --> 00:53:28,556
Everyone is very good.

571
00:53:28,556 --> 00:53:30,150
Yay! Pass!

572
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:33,000
Then let's go to the aquarium before it gets dark.

573
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,236
Quick!

574
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,737
Quick! Go!

575
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:39,402
Let's go!

576
00:53:51,881 --> 00:53:56,509
(Jeng: Where is the next location?)

577
00:53:56,963 --> 00:53:59,291
(Pat: The aquarium.)

578
00:53:59,291 --> 00:54:02,575
(Jeng: I'll go wait there.)

579
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,399
Hello Mr. Jeng.

580
00:54:36,602 --> 00:54:37,726
Hello Mr. Put.

581
00:54:41,422 --> 00:54:43,258
The block shot photos were really nice.

582
00:54:45,092 --> 00:54:48,352
We really have to thank Kanoon,
he's really talented.

583
00:54:48,641 --> 00:54:50,422
He really is.

584
00:54:54,545 --> 00:54:55,943
Are you from here?

585
00:54:56,671 --> 00:54:57,193
Yes.

586
00:54:57,971 --> 00:54:59,752
Born and raised here.

587
00:55:00,528 --> 00:55:03,294
I went after my dreams in Bangkok.

588
00:55:04,964 --> 00:55:05,924
You're very talented.

589
00:55:07,455 --> 00:55:08,196
No, I'm not.

590
00:55:09,592 --> 00:55:13,289
I'm just good looking so that takes me closer to the finish line.

591
00:55:13,982 --> 00:55:15,270
The rest is just perseverance.

592
00:55:17,065 --> 00:55:18,080
But honestly.

593
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:22,015
It seems like you were born at the finish line.

594
00:55:26,858 --> 00:55:27,927
Why?

595
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:31,454
Well, you're handsome.

596
00:55:31,454 --> 00:55:32,357
Rich.

597
00:55:32,357 --> 00:55:34,495
And very talented.

598
00:55:38,118 --> 00:55:40,118
Mr. Jeng, your coffee.

599
00:55:41,648 --> 00:55:42,717
Thank you very much.

600
00:55:42,717 --> 00:55:43,217
Yes.

601
00:55:50,304 --> 00:55:51,483
Is there something wrong?

602
00:55:52,946 --> 00:55:53,961
No.

603
00:55:54,947 --> 00:55:57,280
Pat, have you ever seen a shark's egg?

604
00:55:57,573 --> 00:55:59,299
Their eggs?

605
00:56:00,489 --> 00:56:02,489
Don't they just give birth to a small shark?

606
00:56:02,489 --> 00:56:03,778
There are also eggs.

607
00:56:03,778 --> 00:56:05,035
Really?

608
00:56:05,035 --> 00:56:06,163
It's over there, go look.

609
00:56:06,984 --> 00:56:08,053
Just a sec.

610
00:56:09,326 --> 00:56:10,505
We have many more places to go.

611
00:56:11,956 --> 00:56:13,025
Come on.

612
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:48,050
Hey.

613
00:56:48,986 --> 00:56:51,095
I'm sorry, I didn't see your message.

614
00:56:51,601 --> 00:56:53,601
Ah, it's okay. You just work.

615
00:56:54,361 --> 00:56:55,080
Ae.

616
00:56:56,662 --> 00:56:57,841
I'm so happy.

617
00:56:59,304 --> 00:57:02,070
We're finally getting married!

618
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:09,737
Do you really think we can be parents?

619
00:57:10,995 --> 00:57:12,667
What? Why?

620
00:57:15,106 --> 00:57:18,694
I'm ready, with my age and income.

621
00:57:18,694 --> 00:57:23,923
But when I think about my job, will I have the time?

622
00:57:24,635 --> 00:57:28,442
We have money but no time, it's not ok.

623
00:57:29,674 --> 00:57:31,838
I'll take care of the baby.

624
00:57:32,321 --> 00:57:37,113
I trust you so much, you'll cause mischief with the baby!

625
00:57:39,112 --> 00:57:41,112
Can I video call you?

626
00:57:41,521 --> 00:57:42,974
Ah, just a sec.

627
00:57:47,315 --> 00:57:48,549
What's up?

628
00:58:02,921 --> 00:58:03,662
Ae.

629
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,034
Will you marry me?

630
00:58:23,275 --> 00:58:27,793
After this project, let's go to Khon Kaen to tell our parents.

631
00:58:43,425 --> 00:58:44,604
Fine.

632
00:58:47,214 --> 00:58:49,050
We'll get married.

633
00:58:58,761 --> 00:59:01,746
Where are you?

634
00:59:03,402 --> 00:59:03,902
Huh?

635
00:59:07,063 --> 00:59:09,063
I'm at the aquarium.

636
00:59:10,434 --> 00:59:13,638
Look! This fish will be our witness!

637
00:59:14,487 --> 00:59:16,760
Should we name our baby fish?

638
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,224
Are you joking?

639
00:59:24,241 --> 00:59:25,803
I'm just kidding.

640
00:59:28,285 --> 00:59:29,409
I love you so much Ae.

641
00:59:30,703 --> 00:59:32,594
I'll call you after work.

642
00:59:34,182 --> 00:59:35,175
Ok.

643
00:59:49,727 --> 00:59:52,658
I'm sorry, am I in your way?

644
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:55,307
Take your time.

645
00:59:55,719 --> 00:59:57,227
Thank you.

646
00:59:57,227 --> 00:59:59,031
I'm getting married!

647
01:00:00,001 --> 01:00:01,235
Yes! Yes!

648
01:00:01,235 --> 01:00:02,356
I'm getting married!

649
01:00:03,955 --> 01:00:05,024
Ohhh.

650
01:00:13,263 --> 01:00:13,949
Hey.

651
01:00:14,579 --> 01:00:15,560
Are you ok?

652
01:00:17,044 --> 01:00:18,223
I'm fine.

653
01:00:20,795 --> 01:00:24,273
Are wedding dresses expensive?

654
01:00:32,553 --> 01:00:33,458
Not really.

655
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:36,701
It's not really expensive.

656
01:00:38,179 --> 01:00:39,522
You have to go help me pick it out.

657
01:00:40,479 --> 01:00:42,479
Fine.

658
01:00:42,892 --> 01:00:43,414
Ok.

659
01:00:45,651 --> 01:00:47,651
Go, I'm going to eat.

660
01:00:49,748 --> 01:00:52,624
Come on, let's celebrate.

661
01:00:57,281 --> 01:00:58,734
Congratulations.

662
01:01:02,348 --> 01:01:04,348
Thank you so much,

663
01:01:06,354 --> 01:01:08,026
for always being beside me.

664
01:01:10,001 --> 01:01:11,016
It's fine.

665
01:01:11,864 --> 01:01:15,616
But I'm worried, can I be a parent?

666
01:01:17,231 --> 01:01:20,000
Of course you can, don't worry.

667
01:01:21,832 --> 01:01:23,394
Really? Ok.

668
01:01:23,695 --> 01:01:25,695
Eat, celebrate!

669
01:01:28,013 --> 01:01:28,960
You have to eat a lot!

670
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:29,862
Yeah.

671
01:01:33,681 --> 01:01:35,681
You don't have to cry, hey.

672
01:01:48,741 --> 01:01:51,672
Here, Jaab, eat some fried rice.

673
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:54,956
Crab meat for you.

674
01:01:54,956 --> 01:01:56,052
Thank you.

675
01:01:56,651 --> 01:01:59,417
- Kanoon, do you want some?
- Before eating something else, eat fish first.

676
01:01:59,417 --> 01:02:00,499
You'll get smarter.

677
01:02:00,499 --> 01:02:01,281
Do you want to eat?

678
01:02:01,281 --> 01:02:02,275
Yes, I want.

679
01:02:02,275 --> 01:02:04,200
Go ahead.

680
01:02:33,164 --> 01:02:34,726
Pat, do you want Tom Yum?

681
01:02:36,691 --> 01:02:37,432
Huh?

682
01:02:38,128 --> 01:02:39,307
You want Tom Yum?

683
01:02:40,001 --> 01:02:40,851
Oh yes.

684
01:02:41,223 --> 01:02:42,400
I'll get it for you.

685
01:02:42,569 --> 01:02:43,365
Thank you.

686
01:02:48,519 --> 01:02:51,066
Hey hey, aren't you going to give your brother some?

687
01:02:52,944 --> 01:02:54,520
Come on, I'll give you some.

688
01:02:57,321 --> 01:02:59,321
I'll give everyone some.

689
01:03:00,746 --> 01:03:01,706
Thank you.

690
01:03:01,967 --> 01:03:03,967
Thank you Mr. Jeng.

691
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:10,000
Here you go my bro.

692
01:03:10,831 --> 01:03:12,338
Thank you sir.

693
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:14,200
Put, do you want some tom yum too?

694
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:15,781
Alright thank you Mr. Jeng.

695
01:03:15,781 --> 01:03:16,281
Yeah.

696
01:03:19,255 --> 01:03:20,872
That's enough, thank you.

697
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,623
I heard that you like to cook?

698
01:03:25,074 --> 01:03:25,870
Yes.

699
01:03:26,167 --> 01:03:30,840
Yes, Jeng has been fond of cooking since his time in America.

700
01:03:31,673 --> 01:03:37,122
I remember when I came back,
I had to taste hundreds of dishes he made,

701
01:03:37,587 --> 01:03:39,587
to open Pearl & Oliver.

702
01:03:40,639 --> 01:03:42,639
Pearl & Oliver, is yours?

703
01:03:42,999 --> 01:03:44,999
Oh, I'm a partner.

704
01:03:45,365 --> 01:03:48,600
Oh yeah, I forgot.

705
01:03:49,356 --> 01:03:51,356
Mr. Jeng is friends with Tae, right?

706
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:55,343
Well, anyway.

707
01:03:56,574 --> 01:03:59,480
I would like to ask for permission to rent it out for a wedding.

708
01:04:00,232 --> 01:04:03,327
Well, me and Ae, we're going to get married.

709
01:04:04,833 --> 01:04:06,067
Sure.

710
01:04:06,561 --> 01:04:07,630
Thank you.

711
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:08,969
Huh? You and Ae?

712
01:04:08,969 --> 01:04:10,076
Really?

713
01:04:10,654 --> 01:04:13,201
Yeah, who else would I marry?

714
01:04:13,777 --> 01:04:14,737
Congratulations!

715
01:04:14,737 --> 01:04:15,357
Yeah.

716
01:04:15,709 --> 01:04:16,505
Thank you.

717
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,050
Thank you.

718
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:22,681
Oh, we're having a baby.

719
01:04:22,681 --> 01:04:24,273
Oh my gosh!!

720
01:04:24,975 --> 01:04:27,249
You'll be the first one to hold our baby?

721
01:04:27,249 --> 01:04:27,865
That's awesome.

722
01:04:27,865 --> 01:04:28,441
Yeah.

723
01:04:28,441 --> 01:04:29,748
Congratulations!

724
01:04:29,748 --> 01:04:30,365
Thank you.

725
01:04:30,365 --> 01:04:30,865
Congrats.

726
01:04:30,865 --> 01:04:31,841
Thank you.

727
01:04:31,841 --> 01:04:33,564
We're ready to shower the baby with gifts.

728
01:04:33,564 --> 01:04:34,607
Sure.

729
01:04:34,607 --> 01:04:37,198
Reduce the price for my friend!

730
01:04:37,198 --> 01:04:40,361
For Mr. Jeng, he can do it for free!

731
01:04:40,361 --> 01:04:41,361
That's right.

732
01:04:41,361 --> 01:04:42,425
Right?

733
01:04:42,425 --> 01:04:43,640
Very well said.

734
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:48,920
Free!

735
01:04:49,236 --> 01:04:50,415
For free Mr. Jeng?

736
01:04:51,001 --> 01:04:53,384
Of course, anyway we can do it.

737
01:04:53,384 --> 01:04:54,815
He said it!

738
01:04:54,815 --> 01:04:56,321
Thank you so much Mr. Jeng! Thank you!

739
01:04:57,576 --> 01:04:59,576
Don't forget to send me money when you get home.

740
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:04,207
When are you going to stop asking me for money?

741
01:05:04,441 --> 01:05:08,138
Never, you're so rich that it won't bother you.

742
01:05:26,697 --> 01:05:28,040
Thank you seeing me off.

743
01:05:29,379 --> 01:05:32,255
Pat, do you want to go with me?
I can have the driver drop you off.

744
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:34,410
Uh.

745
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:35,681
I'll drop him off myself.

746
01:05:36,167 --> 01:05:37,920
We have the same route.

747
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,376
Get home safe.

748
01:05:41,074 --> 01:05:41,705
Ok.

749
01:05:42,499 --> 01:05:43,280
You too.

750
01:05:44,214 --> 01:05:44,880
Yes.

751
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:09,098
You're acting weird today Mr. Jeng.

752
01:06:10,744 --> 01:06:12,197
How so?

753
01:06:12,746 --> 01:06:15,293
It's just saying goodbye, it's nothing.

754
01:06:20,819 --> 01:06:23,202
Where do you want to go before we head back?

755
01:06:23,732 --> 01:06:25,349
The weather is nice today.

756
01:06:26,971 --> 01:06:28,697
Umm.

757
01:06:30,313 --> 01:06:31,054
Uh.

758
01:06:32,593 --> 01:06:35,688
I saw a really pretty bridge over there.

759
01:06:35,688 --> 01:06:37,950
Should we go over there?

760
01:06:39,232 --> 01:06:40,356
Do you want to go?

761
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:42,986
It's kind of nice.

762
01:06:42,986 --> 01:06:47,410
And it's dark, they've turned all the lights on.

763
01:06:48,094 --> 01:06:50,915
Treat me to some boba tea.

764
01:06:51,626 --> 01:06:53,133
Like you promised me.

765
01:06:54,133 --> 01:06:55,640
Sure.

766
01:06:56,215 --> 01:06:57,777
But...

767
01:06:59,173 --> 01:07:01,064
do they have some here?

768
01:07:01,967 --> 01:07:04,788
Of course they do, because I want them to.

769
01:07:20,356 --> 01:07:24,984
It's a pity the whole team can't go, we're free tomorrow.

770
01:07:28,257 --> 01:07:30,257
But...

771
01:07:30,984 --> 01:07:33,367
It can be fun with just the two of us.

772
01:07:37,446 --> 01:07:39,337
What do you mean?

773
01:07:39,773 --> 01:07:40,360
Huh.

774
01:07:43,115 --> 01:07:44,184
What?

775
01:07:45,471 --> 01:07:46,650
You don't want to go with me?

776
01:07:48,249 --> 01:07:48,749
Huh.

777
01:07:50,001 --> 01:07:51,454
It's not that.

778
01:07:52,029 --> 01:07:52,879
It's just that.

779
01:07:54,057 --> 01:07:57,754
I don't want this to be one sided.

780
01:08:02,627 --> 01:08:04,022
I'm sorry.

781
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:07,897
It's fine, I'm ok.

782
01:08:10,329 --> 01:08:12,329
Aren't we going to make up?

783
01:08:12,329 --> 01:08:13,721
What do you mean?

784
01:08:14,395 --> 01:08:15,519
Make up.

785
01:08:17,025 --> 01:08:18,423
You're acting like a kid.

786
01:08:18,943 --> 01:08:21,490
I always am.

787
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,900
You like saying I'm crazy.

788
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:28,135
We've made up, what now?

789
01:08:29,869 --> 01:08:30,993
Take that?

790
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:34,919
You wanna go!

791
01:08:36,207 --> 01:08:37,112
Let go!

792
01:08:38,727 --> 01:08:40,000
I won't.

793
01:10:26,170 --> 01:10:27,568
I'm sorry.

794
01:10:29,739 --> 01:10:31,520
Nevermind.

795
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:35,240
I'm the one who needs to apologize.

796
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,781
Mr. Jeng, you're so talented.

797
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:35,794
If you want milk tea, you can have it.

798
01:11:47,689 --> 01:11:48,594
Mr. Jeng.

799
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:49,735
Yes?

800
01:11:51,153 --> 01:11:53,153
You can chew it slowly.

801
01:11:58,054 --> 01:11:59,616
I'm sorry,

802
01:12:01,615 --> 01:12:03,068
for getting Put to come to block shot.

803
01:12:11,362 --> 01:12:19,330
I thought that it might be the only way to
convince the Fjord to choose the location that Jaab wanted.

804
01:12:24,462 --> 01:12:26,462
How was their response?

805
01:12:32,158 --> 01:12:34,158
I think it's good.

806
01:12:35,748 --> 01:12:38,679
But I don't know if it's too much.

807
01:12:43,853 --> 01:12:44,813
Nope.

808
01:12:47,376 --> 01:12:48,610
You did well.

809
01:12:53,122 --> 01:12:54,191
You were really good.

810
01:12:58,161 --> 01:12:59,668
You did really good.

811
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,455
Hey, Mr. Jeng! Look! Fireworks!

812
01:13:25,714 --> 01:13:27,057
Oh.

813
01:13:30,001 --> 01:13:31,180
It's so pretty.

814
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:33,080
Very beautiful!

815
01:13:40,001 --> 01:13:41,344
Mr. Jeng, look at that.

816
01:13:42,745 --> 01:13:44,252
I told you that it's pretty.

817
01:13:44,252 --> 01:13:46,038
I didn't know it'd come.

818
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:50,567
Oh, look at that.

819
01:13:53,751 --> 01:13:56,444
See? Over there.

820
01:14:03,121 --> 01:14:04,040
Yes.

821
01:14:05,409 --> 01:14:06,478
Cheers?

822
01:14:08,212 --> 01:14:09,117
Cheers.

823
01:14:31,281 --> 01:14:33,281
What would you like to drink?

824
01:14:33,281 --> 01:14:35,034
Try asking Pat.

825
01:14:35,034 --> 01:14:36,583
Pat knows what I like to drink.

826
01:14:36,583 --> 01:14:38,254
I asked for your help.

827
01:14:38,254 --> 01:14:40,939
But it doesn't mean you can do this to me.

828
01:14:40,939 --> 01:14:42,665
Have you eaten?

829
01:14:42,665 --> 01:14:44,795
There's a 1 for 1 promotion.

830
01:14:44,795 --> 01:14:46,236
Do you want to eat?

831
01:14:46,572 --> 01:14:49,480
You don't have to be formal with me?

832
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,281
My back hurts.

833
01:14:51,281 --> 01:14:54,602
My chair at home is not really great,
I'm thinking of buying a new one.

834
01:14:54,602 --> 01:14:55,899
Will you go with me?

835
01:14:55,899 --> 01:14:56,881
This is cute!

836
01:14:56,881 --> 01:14:57,664
This one is also cute!

837
01:14:58,090 --> 01:14:59,050
Do you like it?
