1
00:00:01,229 --> 00:00:02,701
I like you.

2
00:00:03,848 --> 00:00:05,112
What are you saying?

3
00:00:05,112 --> 00:00:06,583
How could you like me?

4
00:00:06,583 --> 00:00:07,945
It doesn't make sense.

5
00:00:07,945 --> 00:00:10,019
I like Pat so much.

6
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,524
But our relationship right now.

7
00:00:12,524 --> 00:00:15,866
It can't make our love happen at all.

8
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:17,163
Please be strong.

9
00:00:18,957 --> 00:00:20,957
Mr. Jeng is resigning from the department.

10
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,634
That's not true.

11
00:00:24,455 --> 00:00:28,610
He built this department with his own hands,
why is he leaving so easily?

12
00:00:36,108 --> 00:00:37,687
How are the colors?

13
00:00:39,104 --> 00:00:40,000
It's great.

14
00:00:41,511 --> 00:00:44,352
Is there anything you'd like to fix?

15
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,112
No, it's ok.

16
00:00:48,112 --> 00:00:49,024
Ok.

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,214
Chot, are you ok with it?

18
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:54,710
Put's skin looks so great.

19
00:00:55,815 --> 00:00:58,288
It's perfect Jaab.

20
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:10,000
But let's wait for Mr. Jeng confirms it again,
I think he's on his way.

21
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,227
So everybody is ok with it?

22
00:01:12,227 --> 00:01:13,766
Yes.

23
00:01:14,346 --> 00:01:15,400
That's great.

24
00:01:18,999 --> 00:01:21,946
Look, they are so natural.

25
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:24,857
They are the perfect couple.

26
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:36,533
Ah, Jaab?

27
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:37,336
Yes?

28
00:01:37,336 --> 00:01:45,226
Please upload it to the drive, and send it to
my email because Mr. Jeng can't come anymore.

29
00:01:45,594 --> 00:01:47,074
Sure.

30
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:48,371
Thank you.

31
00:01:48,371 --> 00:01:50,632
Why can't Mr. Jeng come?

32
00:01:50,632 --> 00:01:52,671
Oh, I have no idea about that.

33
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:54,783
He's probably playing hooky.

34
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:14,513
Pat.

35
00:02:15,712 --> 00:02:17,712
Mr. Jeng said he has an announcement.

36
00:02:18,435 --> 00:02:23,116
So he's made an urgent team meeting
tomorrow morning.

37
00:02:57,185 --> 00:02:58,050
Pat.

38
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:06,000
Pat!

39
00:03:07,998 --> 00:03:10,261
What's wrong again?

40
00:03:10,261 --> 00:03:11,763
You're always zoning out.

41
00:03:17,506 --> 00:03:18,823
Is this about Mr. Jeng?

42
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:25,025
Oh, no chance for me to eat now.

43
00:03:30,316 --> 00:03:33,789
Pat, I understand you.

44
00:03:35,328 --> 00:03:37,328
But I also understand Mr. Jeng too.

45
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:41,325
This might be the best solution.

46
00:03:44,105 --> 00:03:48,523
Well, I know that Mr. Jeng
thinks of you beyond work.

47
00:03:49,522 --> 00:03:51,522
And you probably feel no difference.

48
00:03:53,502 --> 00:03:55,502
But with Mr. Jeng choosing to quit.

49
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,344
It might be a good thing,

50
00:03:57,344 --> 00:04:01,289
a boss-subordinate relationship in the office,
something like this will not exist anymore.

51
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:03,374
You both might have some hope.

52
00:04:06,266 --> 00:04:08,266
I understand.

53
00:04:10,448 --> 00:04:12,448
But it doesn't seem to make any sense.

54
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:16,554
I'm not suitable for someone like him.

55
00:04:17,526 --> 00:04:19,158
How could he tell me that he liked me?

56
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:19,658
What?

57
00:04:20,472 --> 00:04:22,367
He told you that he liked you?

58
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:26,522
Pat, you're so mean!

59
00:04:27,608 --> 00:04:33,761
Do you know how much courage
it takes to tell our feelings to someone?

60
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,858
How much it takes to get the words out?

61
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,400
Those feelings in our heads, the love, hope,
and confusion all mixed together.

62
00:04:43,228 --> 00:04:48,014
Ah, it doesn't have to be a happy ending.

63
00:04:48,604 --> 00:04:51,393
But you told him no, it is not a big deal.

64
00:04:51,945 --> 00:04:56,994
But saying that you don't believe him,
it's like you were looking down on his feelings.

65
00:04:57,789 --> 00:05:02,365
He's a smart person,
he knows how to handle his feelings.

66
00:05:02,365 --> 00:05:04,051
So that's why he told you.

67
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,645
He's really giving it his all.

68
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,480
But.

69
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,928
I know what you're going to say.

70
00:05:14,032 --> 00:05:17,557
Don't think that it's not right
or that you're not good enough for him.

71
00:05:18,107 --> 00:05:21,789
You're already mean to Mr. Jeng,
don't be mean to yourself.

72
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:26,576
So what should I do?

73
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,000
Or do you want to be straightforward with him?

74
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:32,487
It might be good for your relationship.

75
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,961
But if you choose to act like that,

76
00:05:35,592 --> 00:05:38,118
then don't care about
how other people look at you.

77
00:05:38,118 --> 00:05:42,919
Because in the end,
the person who knows us best is ourselves.

78
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:43,677
Carry your head high.

79
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:45,859
Ok.

80
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:53,632
But you must understand that
your initial relationship will be awkward.

81
00:05:54,314 --> 00:05:55,578
But you have to be patient.

82
00:05:57,102 --> 00:05:58,787
When you're patient,

83
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:02,731
everything will go well, I believe.

84
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:15,859
What about you and Krit?

85
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:20,094
Oh yeah, it's been 8 years already.

86
00:06:20,864 --> 00:06:22,864
I see it as something normal.

87
00:06:24,611 --> 00:06:27,505
And Krit doesn't think about
hard launching you at all?

88
00:06:31,395 --> 00:06:32,554
I'm not sure,

89
00:06:33,868 --> 00:06:35,237
but I'm ok.

90
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:39,761
He said that someday it'll be our day.

91
00:06:40,001 --> 00:06:43,105
We believe that everything has its time.

92
00:06:43,841 --> 00:06:46,524
But right now, you should focus on yourself first.

93
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,843
Whatever you want to do,
hurry up and do it.

94
00:06:53,161 --> 00:06:57,737
Jaab said that Mr. Jeng is at Pearl & Oliver,

95
00:06:58,473 --> 00:07:00,000
and I think it's his birthday.

96
00:07:00,683 --> 00:07:02,105
Hurry up and deal with it.

97
00:07:04,433 --> 00:07:05,171
Eat some food.

98
00:08:42,053 --> 00:08:42,633
Excuse me?

99
00:08:43,054 --> 00:08:44,633
I want this cake, please.

100
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,219
Scan to pay.

101
00:08:54,063 --> 00:08:54,801
Thank you.

102
00:09:17,017 --> 00:09:18,281
What's up Krit?

103
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,000
(Can we talk?)

104
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,539
Sure, why can't we?

105
00:09:23,806 --> 00:09:24,544
(Chot.)

106
00:09:25,593 --> 00:09:27,803
(From now on,
we don't have to hide our relationship anymore.)

107
00:09:31,483 --> 00:09:32,379
What?

108
00:09:33,535 --> 00:09:34,852
(I've told my parents.)

109
00:09:44,315 --> 00:09:46,000
You're not kidding me, right?

110
00:09:46,683 --> 00:09:47,842
(Why would I do that?)

111
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:51,516
(Let's go have a meal
with my parents next week.)

112
00:10:07,248 --> 00:10:08,670
Thank you.

113
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,721
Thank you so much.

114
00:10:29,467 --> 00:10:30,784
Arhhh!

115
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,062
Mr. Jeng.

116
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:10,059
Are you really resigning?

117
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:20,524
Can you not resign?

118
00:11:21,523 --> 00:11:22,734
Please?

119
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:23,683
Pat.

120
00:11:34,408 --> 00:11:36,145
Do you still like me?

121
00:12:16,564 --> 00:12:17,064
Pat.

122
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,380
Pat.

123
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:41,580
You're crying so much.

124
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:44,346
Don't cry.

125
00:12:45,635 --> 00:12:46,794
I'm sorry.

126
00:12:58,016 --> 00:12:58,859
Pat.

127
00:13:00,752 --> 00:13:02,962
I'm not letting you wonder anymore.

128
00:13:06,642 --> 00:13:07,748
I like you.

129
00:13:09,483 --> 00:13:10,694
I like you so much.

130
00:13:12,271 --> 00:13:13,693
And I like you more and more every day.

131
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,058
And I miss you the most, never less.

132
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:30,000
Why are you avoiding me?

133
00:13:31,557 --> 00:13:33,767
Why are you leaving the company?

134
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,507
I don't understand.

135
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:41,977
You taught me how to be a good boss.

136
00:13:46,341 --> 00:13:50,000
But you can't leave everyone like this.

137
00:13:50,811 --> 00:13:51,654
Pat.

138
00:13:52,735 --> 00:13:54,367
I'm not avoiding you.

139
00:13:54,682 --> 00:13:56,682
I'm not leaving everyone.

140
00:13:57,342 --> 00:14:00,867
I'm still here
but I'm just changing my position.

141
00:14:02,812 --> 00:14:06,389
But I don't want you to feel uncomfortable
because of our status.

142
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,229
But if it's because of me,
is it better if I leave?

143
00:14:13,857 --> 00:14:16,856
Pat, I started it myself.

144
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,750
I should have to fix it myself.

145
00:14:28,282 --> 00:14:30,282
But I also like you.

146
00:14:48,864 --> 00:14:50,759
Now, we're together.

147
00:14:59,756 --> 00:15:01,230
Don't, Mr. Jeng.

148
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,677
Someone might see us.

149
00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:08,249
There're cameras here.

150
00:15:15,819 --> 00:15:17,030
It's alright.

151
00:15:18,422 --> 00:15:19,686
I own this place.

152
00:15:57,787 --> 00:15:58,368
Hey!

153
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,987
Happy birthday!

154
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:15,205
I'm sorry, the cake is all messed up.

155
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:24,292
It's alright.

156
00:16:25,174 --> 00:16:26,701
I don't want a birthday cake.

157
00:16:29,153 --> 00:16:30,312
Just you is enough.

158
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:53,068
The cake is pretty good.

159
00:18:07,552 --> 00:18:08,606
Why are you smiling?

160
00:18:09,762 --> 00:18:11,184
Is there cake on my face?

161
00:18:13,865 --> 00:18:14,761
No.

162
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:33,911
Are you secretly taking a picture of me?

163
00:18:35,383 --> 00:18:37,068
I don't think this looks like
I'm secretly doing it.

164
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:44,899
Then...

165
00:18:47,264 --> 00:18:48,633
Should we take a picture together?

166
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:53,315
A selfie.

167
00:18:54,496 --> 00:18:56,496
Do we have to be this close?

168
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:57,610
Yes.

169
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,218
We'll just take it
for only the two of us to see.

170
00:19:17,495 --> 00:19:19,495
Your phone's film is cracked?

171
00:19:20,945 --> 00:19:24,154
Yes, it cracked today when I fell.

172
00:19:27,086 --> 00:19:29,664
Are you hurt anywhere?

173
00:19:30,132 --> 00:19:31,554
No.

174
00:19:32,841 --> 00:19:34,420
But...

175
00:19:38,797 --> 00:19:40,797
How about I change it for you?

176
00:19:42,927 --> 00:19:45,137
Do you know how to change phone films?

177
00:19:45,696 --> 00:19:46,329
Yes.

178
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,274
Jaab used to drop his phone all the time.

179
00:19:49,274 --> 00:19:50,651
The screen protector was always cracked.

180
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:52,651
So I practiced changing it.

181
00:19:53,177 --> 00:19:57,227
And it's also my fault that it's like that.

182
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:00,000
Let me do it for you.

183
00:20:17,943 --> 00:20:18,839
All done.

184
00:20:19,522 --> 00:20:20,733
It's like a brand-new phone.

185
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,515
No cracks at all.

186
00:20:30,001 --> 00:20:33,526
Is this Commy that's a hydrogel film?

187
00:20:34,209 --> 00:20:36,998
Where they say that it's more durable than glass films.

188
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:39,787
Yes.

189
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,943
I've been using Commy for a long time.

190
00:20:43,626 --> 00:20:44,837
No matter how many times I drop it,
there's no crack.

191
00:20:47,017 --> 00:20:48,491
Thank you, Mr. Jeng.

192
00:20:50,001 --> 00:20:52,001
But I'm not allowing you to fall anymore.

193
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,186
You're talking nonsense.

194
00:22:04,797 --> 00:22:09,741
So from now on, what are we?

195
00:23:04,337 --> 00:23:07,441
I'd like to end this presentation here, thank you.

196
00:23:20,308 --> 00:23:22,308
I think your slides are looking better.

197
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,793
Now you can do better than me.

198
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:27,826
I don't believe it.

199
00:23:28,918 --> 00:23:30,000
This one is perfect.

200
00:23:35,126 --> 00:23:39,229
I think you should be less perfect,
it'd be too much.

201
00:23:40,214 --> 00:23:40,952
Really?

202
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:41,634
Yes.

203
00:23:42,472 --> 00:23:43,683
How less perfect do I have to be?

204
00:23:43,683 --> 00:23:44,814
Come on, let me help you.

205
00:24:02,391 --> 00:24:03,049
Hi.

206
00:25:23,881 --> 00:25:24,987
Careful, Mr. Jeng!

207
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:54,384
Come on Ying.

208
00:25:54,384 --> 00:25:55,332
Get it, Ying.

209
00:25:55,332 --> 00:25:56,076
Go!

210
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,660
Go on Ying!

211
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:00,220
That's good.

212
00:26:00,941 --> 00:26:01,627
Quickly!

213
00:26:02,021 --> 00:26:02,601
Ying!

214
00:26:06,086 --> 00:26:08,086
You haven't won yet!

215
00:26:08,086 --> 00:26:10,367
I did! It's 21 points for the win.

216
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:11,372
What?

217
00:26:11,677 --> 00:26:12,626
Don't stop!

218
00:26:12,626 --> 00:26:13,591
It's 21-0.

219
00:26:16,948 --> 00:26:18,265
Awesome.

220
00:26:18,265 --> 00:26:18,822
You're the best.

221
00:26:18,822 --> 00:26:19,689
That's good.

222
00:26:19,689 --> 00:26:23,329
Gimme some weaklings!

223
00:26:25,202 --> 00:26:26,045
Here Pat.

224
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:28,036
Let me plan our game plan first.

225
00:26:28,825 --> 00:26:30,000
Come on, give me the badminton.

226
00:26:34,307 --> 00:26:38,042
What about mine?

227
00:26:38,042 --> 00:26:40,652
Oh, I forgot.

228
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:42,725
Here.

229
00:26:42,725 --> 00:26:43,902
Thank you.

230
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:44,402
Ok.

231
00:26:45,317 --> 00:26:46,318
Hey.

232
00:26:47,866 --> 00:26:49,603
Arm is waiting to play.

233
00:26:52,052 --> 00:26:52,948
How are you, Pat?

234
00:26:53,631 --> 00:26:54,422
It's pretty fun.

235
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:55,654
Are you tired?

236
00:26:56,338 --> 00:26:57,234
Not at all.

237
00:26:59,762 --> 00:27:00,553
Thank you.

238
00:27:01,715 --> 00:27:02,215
Sure.

239
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:09,080
Do you want some?

240
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,622
It's ok, you can have it.

241
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:15,792
Go ahead.

242
00:27:17,652 --> 00:27:18,152
Toh.

243
00:27:18,152 --> 00:27:19,475
Huh?

244
00:27:19,475 --> 00:27:21,475
Why don't you walk up to them
if you're staring like that?

245
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,293
Nothing.

246
00:27:24,253 --> 00:27:25,359
What are you thinking?

247
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:27,019
It's nothing.

248
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:31,678
I just feel like Mr. Jeng and Pat seem really close.

249
00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:38,162
How is it strange?
They worked on Fjord together.

250
00:27:38,162 --> 00:27:40,201
It's not strange for them to be close.

251
00:27:41,148 --> 00:27:42,412
But I'm his assistant.

252
00:27:43,568 --> 00:27:45,358
So?

253
00:27:45,358 --> 00:27:45,991
Hey.

254
00:27:46,629 --> 00:27:50,311
Me and Prem have worked together for a long time.

255
00:27:50,311 --> 00:27:53,348
Believe me, today I'm not close with Prem at all.

256
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:59,622
Seriously, the two of them
might have something in common.

257
00:27:59,622 --> 00:28:03,820
Their lifestyles may be the same.
So they looked close.

258
00:28:04,695 --> 00:28:06,695
Don't think too much,
do you understand?

259
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:10,419
People at work, they come and go.

260
00:28:10,977 --> 00:28:13,398
Don't think too much, eh.

261
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,169
What are you staring at?

262
00:28:39,483 --> 00:28:40,484
At the view.

263
00:28:43,744 --> 00:28:47,058
Wow, I envy you.

264
00:28:47,899 --> 00:28:50,000
You get to look at this beautiful view.

265
00:28:51,476 --> 00:28:53,476
The sky is beautiful like this every day.

266
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:58,870
It's beautiful.

267
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,931
But today is especially beautiful.

268
00:29:05,139 --> 00:29:06,876
Because you're next to me.

269
00:29:09,662 --> 00:29:11,136
What are you saying?

270
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,082
I'm going to throw up.

271
00:29:18,761 --> 00:29:19,657
Your shirt is wrinkled.

272
00:29:21,129 --> 00:29:23,287
I brought a bakery from the cafe at the company.

273
00:29:25,337 --> 00:29:27,232
Do you want to give it away
to the homeless with me?

274
00:29:29,177 --> 00:29:30,000
Sure.

275
00:29:35,789 --> 00:29:36,527
Am I handsome yet?

276
00:29:39,022 --> 00:29:39,790
I'm not telling you.

277
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,049
Shall we go?

278
00:29:41,466 --> 00:29:42,099
Okay.

279
00:29:43,097 --> 00:29:43,783
Come on.

280
00:29:50,001 --> 00:29:51,160
Can I help you?

281
00:29:51,475 --> 00:29:52,371
It's ok.

282
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:01,153
Hi.

283
00:30:01,731 --> 00:30:02,417
Here.

284
00:30:03,482 --> 00:30:04,062
Thank you.

285
00:30:04,062 --> 00:30:04,723
Sure.

286
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,191
Hello, here.

287
00:30:07,733 --> 00:30:08,524
Mr. Jeng.

288
00:30:08,524 --> 00:30:09,872
How are you?

289
00:30:11,502 --> 00:30:12,345
Hello.

290
00:30:12,345 --> 00:30:12,926
Hi.

291
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,458
Thank you.

292
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:14,961
Sure.

293
00:30:16,953 --> 00:30:17,533
Sure.

294
00:30:18,832 --> 00:30:19,570
Sure.

295
00:30:24,804 --> 00:30:27,067
Here, the rest can be given to other people.

296
00:30:28,404 --> 00:30:30,614
I leave it to the rest of you.

297
00:30:31,055 --> 00:30:32,214
Thank you very much.

298
00:30:38,694 --> 00:30:40,221
Let's go and sit down.

299
00:30:41,136 --> 00:30:44,661
When I was in America,
there are a lot of homeless as well.

300
00:30:45,282 --> 00:30:47,282
The world is cruel, isn't it?

301
00:30:49,084 --> 00:30:50,821
The world is not cruel, Pat.

302
00:30:51,381 --> 00:30:54,432
I think people are cruel.

303
00:30:55,873 --> 00:30:59,398
Especially you, you made me cry several times.

304
00:31:01,185 --> 00:31:02,028
I'm sorry.

305
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:06,601
Well, when I see you saying something handsome,
I can't help but interrupt it.

306
00:31:11,087 --> 00:31:14,349
The Jian Group itself is a large food producer.

307
00:31:15,505 --> 00:31:18,872
So I'm trying to solve the problem
of overloading food every day.

308
00:31:19,292 --> 00:31:21,765
But it's too much.

309
00:31:22,002 --> 00:31:23,844
Both business and cost.

310
00:31:26,722 --> 00:31:31,140
Someday you'll become the CEO, right?

311
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:33,613
Why?

312
00:31:35,898 --> 00:31:38,792
Well, try to keep it as a homework.

313
00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:43,589
Are you repeating my words?

314
00:31:47,796 --> 00:31:48,692
No.

315
00:31:52,783 --> 00:31:55,940
This picture was drawn by me,
you look the same.

316
00:31:57,593 --> 00:31:59,435
It looks like us.

317
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:14,526
What is it?

318
00:32:15,052 --> 00:32:17,894
It's like the picture that he drew.

319
00:32:23,729 --> 00:32:26,623
No, people will see.

320
00:32:28,307 --> 00:32:29,623
No one will see.

321
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,858
Let's go.

322
00:32:52,768 --> 00:32:55,346
Oh, it was released not long ago.

323
00:32:55,346 --> 00:32:57,714
Organic reach is about to
hit 2 million already.

324
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,921
It's true, is there any campaign of Jian Group
that can do this?

325
00:33:03,552 --> 00:33:04,606
I think there is.

326
00:33:04,921 --> 00:33:06,553
But it's likely to be a bigger project.

327
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:10,919
Compared to the proportion of the budget,
ours are considered to be doing a lot better than others.

328
00:33:11,732 --> 00:33:15,677
Oh, this is really thanks to
the power of boy love fans.

329
00:33:15,677 --> 00:33:19,716
This is the first day
and it's already on the world trend.

330
00:33:20,295 --> 00:33:24,819
But even so, we have to measure the sales,
which we haven't concluded yet.

331
00:33:25,449 --> 00:33:29,762
This is it, although the health trend is hot.

332
00:33:29,762 --> 00:33:35,641
But when it comes in the form of a supplement,
I think we are still slower than other brands.

333
00:33:38,288 --> 00:33:39,499
Mr. Jeng, what do you think?

334
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:42,025
It's an interesting analysis.

335
00:33:42,245 --> 00:33:47,505
But R&D Products take a lot of time
before they can release anything.

336
00:33:47,786 --> 00:33:50,400
It depends on how much we can push it.

337
00:33:52,076 --> 00:33:54,076
Can you please share the information on the screen?

338
00:33:54,226 --> 00:33:55,858
Alright, just a moment.

339
00:33:56,928 --> 00:33:57,440
Ah, here.

340
00:33:59,005 --> 00:34:00,000
This is top secret.

341
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:03,006
They haven't shared the official information yet,

342
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:05,073
but as you can see from the graph.

343
00:34:05,073 --> 00:34:06,893
Ever since we released the film.

344
00:34:06,893 --> 00:34:09,939
The order of Lively Plus in each branch
has increased a lot.

345
00:34:10,307 --> 00:34:13,674
And especially in the east and the central region.

346
00:34:15,198 --> 00:34:18,197
It may be a predictive order that will sell more.

347
00:34:18,412 --> 00:34:21,989
But still can't conclude that all of them
can be sold as delivered or not.

348
00:34:23,452 --> 00:34:27,608
So is this a good sign?

349
00:34:28,238 --> 00:34:30,000
It's considered a good sign.

350
00:34:30,827 --> 00:34:32,091
Everyone did very well.

351
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,050
Gee, Mr. Jeng! Clap your hands!

352
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:45,358
Oh, is it a secret?
Can I see it again?

353
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:45,897
Sure.

354
00:35:21,023 --> 00:35:22,181
So this is Jeng?

355
00:35:22,181 --> 00:35:23,300
Yes, Dad.

356
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,535
This is Jeng.

357
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:28,070
Yes, I'm Jeng.

358
00:35:30,881 --> 00:35:31,514
Do you know?

359
00:35:32,627 --> 00:35:35,040
How many days Pat did not eat or sleep?

360
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,195
Do you know, do you know?

361
00:35:37,195 --> 00:35:38,993
Dad. Dad.

362
00:35:39,308 --> 00:35:40,375
I'm sorry.

363
00:35:44,615 --> 00:35:46,194
I'm going to go to Chiangmai for a long time.

364
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,772
Can you take care of Pat?

365
00:35:53,864 --> 00:35:55,864
Don't worry about it.

366
00:35:57,181 --> 00:35:57,814
Good.

367
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,604
Very clear.

368
00:35:59,906 --> 00:36:01,065
I like that.

369
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:03,804
Thank you.

370
00:36:06,065 --> 00:36:10,000
But if you make Pat sad again,

371
00:36:10,746 --> 00:36:11,957
remember,

372
00:36:13,061 --> 00:36:15,587
that you'll never get to see his face again!

373
00:36:15,587 --> 00:36:16,405
Remember that!

374
00:36:16,405 --> 00:36:19,066
Go Dad, or you'll miss your flight.

375
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:20,615
Go!

376
00:36:20,615 --> 00:36:21,929
Let me help you with that.

377
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:22,802
Dad.

378
00:36:25,055 --> 00:36:26,529
You're calling me Dad?

379
00:36:28,054 --> 00:36:29,360
When did we become buddies?

380
00:36:30,211 --> 00:36:31,685
Go, Dad.

381
00:36:31,685 --> 00:36:32,493
Careful.

382
00:36:32,493 --> 00:36:33,256
You're going to fall.

383
00:36:33,256 --> 00:36:34,431
Go.

384
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:06,433
Should we shower and then go to sleep?

385
00:37:08,782 --> 00:37:10,000
No.

386
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:15,200
Come on babe.

387
00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:17,343
Go take a shower.

388
00:37:17,343 --> 00:37:18,449
No.

389
00:37:19,606 --> 00:37:21,711
Come on, you'll feel much better.

390
00:37:21,974 --> 00:37:23,426
Let's shower first.

391
00:37:24,437 --> 00:37:25,491
I'm tired.

392
00:37:33,061 --> 00:37:36,796
Can't I just go to bed?
I'm so tired.

393
00:37:37,837 --> 00:37:41,152
Take a shower first and then you'll feel good.

394
00:37:43,487 --> 00:37:45,803
I think you'll have to give me a shower.

395
00:37:50,799 --> 00:37:51,642
Oh.

396
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:53,887
This is all on you.

397
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,054
Come here.

398
00:38:05,427 --> 00:38:06,586
You're pretty heavy.

399
00:38:06,586 --> 00:38:09,113
Hey, I'm gonna fall.

400
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:12,952
Jeng.

401
00:38:18,209 --> 00:38:18,789
Yes?

402
00:38:21,408 --> 00:38:23,723
Could you go to Ae's wedding with me on Saturday?

403
00:38:25,021 --> 00:38:26,758
Sure, of course.

404
00:38:27,677 --> 00:38:30,571
But let's take a shower first.

405
00:38:31,306 --> 00:38:32,202
Pat.

406
00:38:52,935 --> 00:38:54,514
If you're going to be like this.

407
00:38:55,146 --> 00:38:56,778
I'm not going to have the strength to pick you up.

408
00:39:00,786 --> 00:39:02,786
Do you still want me to take a shower?

409
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,400
You don't have to anymore.

410
00:42:02,351 --> 00:42:03,300
Thank you.

411
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,442
I haven't seen you in such a long time!

412
00:42:04,442 --> 00:42:05,800
Thank you!

413
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,508
See you inside!
See you inside!

414
00:42:07,841 --> 00:42:10,000
Hi! Hi! Hi!

415
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,400
I haven't seen you in so long,
you got so pretty!

416
00:42:12,621 --> 00:42:14,831
Come on! Let's take pictures~

417
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:20,564
Thank you, see you inside.

418
00:42:23,561 --> 00:42:25,360
- Hi!
- Hello!

419
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,932
Come on!  Let's take pictures!

420
00:42:33,084 --> 00:42:34,769
Do you want a picture of you
holding the groom's arm?

421
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:38,926
Aw, no? Teasing, teasing.
It's a joke!

422
00:42:38,926 --> 00:42:40,000
Pat! Come to take a photo.

423
00:42:40,817 --> 00:42:42,449
Hurry up and bring your Mr. Jeng.

424
00:42:43,587 --> 00:42:44,798
Come on, it's hot.

425
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,061
Please.

426
00:42:49,436 --> 00:42:50,437
Congratulations.

427
00:42:50,437 --> 00:42:51,920
Thank you, Mr. Jeng.

428
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,949
Thank you.

429
00:42:53,212 --> 00:42:54,897
Well, you're a close friend.

430
00:42:54,897 --> 00:42:58,380
However, if Jaab and Kanoon get drunk
and throw up, don't find us.

431
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,481
Because the cost of the wedding is enormous,
even if it's a small event.

432
00:43:01,851 --> 00:43:03,168
Oh, yes.

433
00:43:03,168 --> 00:43:04,801
Okay, okay, then take a picture first.

434
00:43:04,801 --> 00:43:08,727
I'm the main star today,
lots of people queuing up for photos.

435
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:09,726
Come on.

436
00:43:10,429 --> 00:43:12,062
Ready?

437
00:43:13,155 --> 00:43:14,472
Another picture.

438
00:43:17,132 --> 00:43:18,186
1 2 3.

439
00:43:18,186 --> 00:43:19,782
Mini heart.
Mini heart.

440
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:22,459
1 2 3.

441
00:43:23,702 --> 00:43:25,702
Another picture.
1 2 3.

442
00:43:25,702 --> 00:43:27,463
Let's do a Y2K pose.

443
00:43:31,251 --> 00:43:35,932
I would like to thank Kanoon
for teaching me so much.

444
00:43:35,932 --> 00:43:41,335
And the important thing is, he came and filled my life up
and it's very hectic in my life. Thank you very much.

445
00:43:41,766 --> 00:43:46,710
Thank you Ae,
I got to do things I've never done.

446
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,525
Today Ae, she's like both a wife and a mother too.

447
00:43:52,141 --> 00:43:55,666
Don't call me a person.
Nowadays, it's better to call me a servant.

448
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:56,166
Yeah.

449
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,644
I can do anything for her
if it makes her happy.

450
00:43:58,644 --> 00:44:00,931
Good ending, good ending.

451
00:44:00,931 --> 00:44:01,438
Yes.

452
00:44:01,904 --> 00:44:04,640
Actually today I have to thank all of you,

453
00:44:04,955 --> 00:44:08,375
who came to our 2nd wedding,

454
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,140
huh?

455
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,440
I mean 2 of us.

456
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,448
Ah...

457
00:44:12,448 --> 00:44:13,356
Thank you very much, everyone.

458
00:44:17,486 --> 00:44:18,803
Ended on a good note.

459
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,462
Almost, almost...

460
00:44:21,108 --> 00:44:22,162
Just teasing the wife.

461
00:44:23,297 --> 00:44:25,718
Have you ever thought about getting married?

462
00:44:30,291 --> 00:44:37,640
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

463
00:45:40,507 --> 00:45:41,771
Hey! Pat!

464
00:45:46,746 --> 00:45:48,746
Some day it'll be our day.

465
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:40,000
Jen.

466
00:46:51,989 --> 00:46:52,622
Jen.

467
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:56,988
Jaab.

468
00:46:58,561 --> 00:47:00,000
Long time no see, how have you been?

469
00:47:04,042 --> 00:47:04,780
It's good.

470
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:07,463
What about you?

471
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:11,146
I heard that you have a partner?

472
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:16,774
Then they didn't come with you?

473
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:20,245
No, they are busy.

474
00:47:24,055 --> 00:47:26,370
By the way, I'm happy for you.

475
00:47:32,294 --> 00:47:33,558
I'm going to go find Kanoon.

476
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,977
We haven't taken a photo yet.

477
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:38,899
Sure.

478
00:48:13,006 --> 00:48:13,586
Hey!

479
00:48:16,281 --> 00:48:18,071
Oh, who's coming, who's coming?

480
00:48:18,071 --> 00:48:20,881
What's up, Makham? Makham.

481
00:48:20,881 --> 00:48:21,989
What's up? What's up?

482
00:48:23,462 --> 00:48:24,358
By the way.

483
00:48:25,409 --> 00:48:26,800
Makham is cute.

484
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,681
Of course.

485
00:48:27,681 --> 00:48:28,755
It's a good structure.

486
00:48:29,228 --> 00:48:30,782
She can grow up to be a star.

487
00:48:31,729 --> 00:48:35,306
Even if the structure is not good,
she can just get plastic surgery.

488
00:48:35,815 --> 00:48:41,880
But I'm sorry,
because her mom's genetics are top-tier.

489
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:42,575
Right.
Right.

490
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:43,766
Right.

491
00:48:45,451 --> 00:48:47,451
She'll cry. She'll cry.

492
00:48:47,451 --> 00:48:50,177
Sure, her mother has the perfect face,
I'm not going to fight on that.

493
00:48:51,958 --> 00:48:52,920
Are you going to have another one?

494
00:48:53,075 --> 00:48:54,560
Kanoon has had a vasectomy!

495
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,060
Huh?

496
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:55,809
Yeah.

497
00:48:55,809 --> 00:48:56,721
Is this true?

498
00:48:56,721 --> 00:48:57,478
It's true.

499
00:48:57,878 --> 00:49:02,520
He said he can't sleep, Makham cried all night
and then he said one kid is enough.

500
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,064
And then boom, a vasectomy.

501
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,025
Crying again.

502
00:49:07,025 --> 00:49:07,998
Nhong?

503
00:49:09,076 --> 00:49:11,391
Nhong, please take Makham.

504
00:49:12,121 --> 00:49:13,122
Go with Auntie Nhong.

505
00:49:13,122 --> 00:49:14,495
Bye bye.

506
00:49:15,209 --> 00:49:15,895
Bye bye.

507
00:49:17,286 --> 00:49:18,182
Bye bye.

508
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,786
But I think it's good.

509
00:49:24,258 --> 00:49:26,626
I think he really loves you too.

510
00:49:26,626 --> 00:49:28,623
Oh, of course, I'm so beautiful.

511
00:49:29,734 --> 00:49:30,840
What's going on?

512
00:49:35,031 --> 00:49:36,137
Um.

513
00:49:42,675 --> 00:49:43,413
Well,

514
00:49:44,254 --> 00:49:44,992
I want to say that...

515
00:49:46,784 --> 00:49:50,488
The reason I called you over is...

516
00:49:51,307 --> 00:49:51,960
is...

517
00:49:53,603 --> 00:49:55,160
You like me.

518
00:49:56,164 --> 00:49:57,849
So you wanted to tell me.

519
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,447
So there would not be any doubts in your heart?

520
00:50:03,204 --> 00:50:03,704
Yeah.

521
00:50:04,703 --> 00:50:05,336
Yeah.

522
00:50:05,809 --> 00:50:06,600
You said everything.

523
00:50:12,446 --> 00:50:13,289
It's just that.

524
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,591
We're good as friends.

525
00:50:18,168 --> 00:50:19,747
I believe that one day.

526
00:50:20,483 --> 00:50:22,168
You'll find your Ae.

527
00:50:22,168 --> 00:50:24,168
Just just like Kanoon found me.

528
00:50:30,512 --> 00:50:31,145
Um.

529
00:50:32,459 --> 00:50:34,932
I don't know what to say.

530
00:50:35,931 --> 00:50:36,932
But I have to thank you.

531
00:50:40,001 --> 00:50:42,632
But I knew I had to give up,

532
00:50:43,318 --> 00:50:45,476
from the time I knew
you were seeing each other.

533
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:50,000
But all this time.

534
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,553
I never had the courage to tell you.

535
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:58,550
I was really scared.

536
00:51:00,001 --> 00:51:02,790
That I'd ruin our good friendship.

537
00:51:06,304 --> 00:51:06,990
Yeah.

538
00:51:08,514 --> 00:51:09,778
I'm good with the way things are.

539
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:17,456
But the day has come.

540
00:51:18,006 --> 00:51:21,479
So I felt like I had nothing to lose.

541
00:51:23,003 --> 00:51:24,425
So I wanted to tell you.

542
00:51:26,475 --> 00:51:27,792
I knew it,
even though you didn't say anything.

543
00:51:32,796 --> 00:51:35,427
But I really have to thank you.

544
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:38,110
Everything was so good.

545
00:51:39,251 --> 00:51:40,725
You were always with me.

546
00:51:43,546 --> 00:51:44,179
Yeah.

547
00:51:48,174 --> 00:51:48,912
My best friend.

548
00:51:50,082 --> 00:51:51,556
I know you'll find someone one day.

549
00:51:52,714 --> 00:51:55,280
But your Ae might not be as hot as this Ae.

550
00:51:56,983 --> 00:51:58,668
You and your confidence.

551
00:51:58,668 --> 00:51:59,739
You're fed up with me?!

552
00:51:59,739 --> 00:52:00,456
Yeah.

553
00:52:02,266 --> 00:52:03,793
Congratulations.

554
00:52:03,793 --> 00:52:05,328
Congratulations, I don't know what else to say.

555
00:52:14,683 --> 00:52:15,369
Yeah.

556
00:52:18,939 --> 00:52:20,466
Did you call me?

557
00:52:20,989 --> 00:52:21,622
Yes.

558
00:52:23,304 --> 00:52:24,936
How was your dad's trip to Chiangmai?

559
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,753
He went to visit the coffee plantation
as you suggested.

560
00:52:29,667 --> 00:52:30,458
Great.

561
00:52:37,842 --> 00:52:39,211
I have good news to tell.

562
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:41,684
Good news?

563
00:52:41,684 --> 00:52:42,189
Yes.

564
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:45,663
The Fjord wants to collab with us again.

565
00:52:46,136 --> 00:52:48,662
Then I suggested
that you be the head of this project,

566
00:52:48,863 --> 00:52:51,073
and the clients seem pretty happy.

567
00:52:53,024 --> 00:52:54,240
Are you sure?

568
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,520
Of course, you've worked with Forge already.

569
00:52:58,098 --> 00:53:00,098
You should be able to handle this task easily.

570
00:53:02,233 --> 00:53:04,444
Ok, I'll try.

571
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:05,368
Yes.

572
00:53:06,106 --> 00:53:07,580
And another matter...

573
00:53:08,053 --> 00:53:11,473
I'm looking for a new manager to replace me.

574
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:15,470
Are you really going to resign?

575
00:53:20,305 --> 00:53:21,832
I've found that person.

576
00:53:23,461 --> 00:53:24,725
That person...

577
00:53:26,986 --> 00:53:28,250
is you.

578
00:53:29,745 --> 00:53:30,483
Huh?

579
00:53:33,504 --> 00:53:35,120
What are you playing at?

580
00:53:35,767 --> 00:53:36,663
Me?

581
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:38,557
Yes.

582
00:53:39,609 --> 00:53:40,715
But don't worry.

583
00:53:41,714 --> 00:53:45,640
I'm going to use these 3 years in molding you.

584
00:53:47,774 --> 00:53:48,828
Because I'm...

585
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,669
watching...

586
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,984
your every step.

587
00:54:11,865 --> 00:54:12,919
Hey.

588
00:54:12,919 --> 00:54:13,419
Huh?

589
00:54:13,419 --> 00:54:16,533
I've heard that
Mr. Jeng and Pat are secretly banging.

590
00:54:17,456 --> 00:54:18,667
What?

591
00:54:18,948 --> 00:54:21,631
He looks so innocent,
never thought he'd work on his knees like that.

592
00:54:21,631 --> 00:54:22,131
Um...

593
00:54:22,131 --> 00:54:24,812
But I was wondering because Mr. Jeng
never had any rumors about women.

594
00:54:24,812 --> 00:54:25,805
Right?

595
00:54:25,805 --> 00:54:26,741
Isn't it clear?

596
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,245
What is clear?

597
00:54:28,779 --> 00:54:31,160
You're gossiping about your boss?

598
00:54:31,749 --> 00:54:32,540
Well...

599
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:35,507
You're acting like
you've never gossiped with us.

600
00:54:35,507 --> 00:54:36,152
That's right.

601
00:54:36,152 --> 00:54:39,025
Oh... It's true.

602
00:54:39,738 --> 00:54:43,052
But I never gossip about their sexual orientations
like this, do you understand?

603
00:54:45,756 --> 00:54:50,000
But there's a clip of them
going into a condo together.

604
00:54:50,173 --> 00:54:53,277
That's all? And you're making such a big fuss?

605
00:54:53,521 --> 00:54:56,572
It's so silly, why don't you get some work done?

606
00:54:56,572 --> 00:54:58,881
Quickly chew and swallow and get back to work.

607
00:54:58,881 --> 00:55:00,485
Come on, quicker.

608
00:55:01,005 --> 00:55:02,164
So silly.

609
00:55:14,826 --> 00:55:16,480
Oh. Goodbye. Goodbye.

610
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,429
Goodbye.

611
00:55:19,681 --> 00:55:20,367
Are you going home?

612
00:55:21,168 --> 00:55:22,011
You can go first.

613
00:55:24,114 --> 00:55:25,273
Ah. Ok.

614
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:45,374
Hey.

615
00:55:46,417 --> 00:55:47,576
You already have Paint.

616
00:55:48,417 --> 00:55:52,047
If you're still thinking about Jen,
how is Paint going to feel?

617
00:55:57,041 --> 00:55:58,463
What do you expect me to do?

618
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:00,568
You have to choose.

619
00:56:01,697 --> 00:56:03,092
Let me tell you something.

620
00:56:03,849 --> 00:56:05,271
If you choose someone,

621
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:07,348
and they don't choose you.

622
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:08,348
Then it's over.

623
00:56:08,979 --> 00:56:11,400
But you can't go back to the other person anymore.

624
00:56:12,401 --> 00:56:13,244
Think about it.

625
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:14,981
I'm going now, the traffic is bad.

626
00:56:16,392 --> 00:56:17,280
See you.

627
00:56:47,201 --> 00:56:52,145
(You suck up to the boss for the bonus.)

628
00:56:52,145 --> 00:56:57,417
(You don't have to work well,
but you can be promoted.)

629
00:57:18,984 --> 00:57:20,984
Don't worry about it, Pat.

630
00:57:20,984 --> 00:57:21,952
Yeah.

631
00:57:23,935 --> 00:57:24,989
Don't mind them.

632
00:57:24,989 --> 00:57:26,055
It's okay.

633
00:57:26,055 --> 00:57:27,421
Don't listen to them.

634
00:57:39,472 --> 00:57:40,526
What happened?

635
00:57:45,514 --> 00:57:46,042
Huh?

636
00:57:51,548 --> 00:57:54,705
All they can do is write it,
they can't do anything else.

637
00:57:56,177 --> 00:57:57,494
I don't understand.

638
00:58:00,001 --> 00:58:02,001
Why is that me and Mr. Jeng being in love?

639
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,419
Why does it bother so many people?

640
00:58:06,263 --> 00:58:07,842
Is it really that wrong?

641
00:58:08,813 --> 00:58:10,287
Am I so wrong?

642
00:58:10,287 --> 00:58:11,319
Pat.

643
00:58:11,591 --> 00:58:12,760
It's not wrong.

644
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,744
People can't stop falling in love.

645
00:58:16,031 --> 00:58:16,769
Pat.

646
00:58:19,356 --> 00:58:20,410
Remember.

647
00:58:21,461 --> 00:58:23,882
This matter is very delicate.

648
00:58:28,613 --> 00:58:31,244
You have to be strong.

649
00:58:32,611 --> 00:58:33,822
Strong?

650
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:37,390
Have I not been strong enough?

651
00:58:43,022 --> 00:58:44,759
It'll pass, Pat.

652
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,954
Believe me.

653
00:58:49,121 --> 00:58:49,701
Hey.

654
00:58:51,331 --> 00:58:53,331
Don't look at them.

655
00:59:06,264 --> 00:59:06,844
Oh?

656
00:59:07,943 --> 00:59:09,207
You're here?

657
00:59:10,001 --> 00:59:11,107
Is there something wrong?

658
00:59:14,225 --> 00:59:15,680
Let me get straight to the point.

659
00:59:16,882 --> 00:59:17,410
Yes.

660
00:59:18,481 --> 00:59:20,691
For the new Fjord project.

661
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,322
Could we not have Pat on the team?

662
00:59:25,635 --> 00:59:28,844
Why? But Fjord requested for him.

663
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:32,421
Don't you know?

664
00:59:32,681 --> 00:59:34,681
About the rumors between you and Pat?

665
00:59:38,413 --> 00:59:39,677
It's just rumours.

666
00:59:40,592 --> 00:59:41,383
Rumors.

667
00:59:42,261 --> 00:59:46,574
But rumors are always more powerful than facts.

668
00:59:47,468 --> 00:59:49,468
The board is uncomfortable with it.

669
00:59:50,243 --> 00:59:52,979
If you don't talk directly to Pat himself.

670
00:59:53,505 --> 00:59:55,137
The board will send him a notice letter.

671
00:59:55,881 --> 00:59:57,618
And when that time comes.

672
00:59:58,985 --> 01:00:00,985
Pat might have a problem for sure.

673
01:00:04,783 --> 01:00:06,205
I'm warning you.

674
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:47,257
(Resignation letter)

675
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,520
I'm not happy at all.

676
01:01:42,613 --> 01:01:44,613
People are starting to look at us strangely.

677
01:02:42,622 --> 01:02:43,991
I don't think we should.

678
01:02:46,354 --> 01:02:47,671
I'm not in the mood.

679
01:02:53,454 --> 01:02:54,508
Ok.

680
01:03:20,927 --> 01:03:22,927
Should we take some time apart?

681
01:03:24,933 --> 01:03:26,197
Let the matter quiet down.

682
01:03:33,347 --> 01:03:35,610
But I'm going to miss you so badly.

683
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:41,080
Can't it just be at work?

684
01:03:43,847 --> 01:03:45,532
I'm not sure.

685
01:03:47,582 --> 01:03:49,582
Even when coming to the condo,
people saw it.

686
01:03:53,053 --> 01:03:55,053
Or should I find a safe house for you?

687
01:03:56,027 --> 01:03:57,600
You talking like we're in a film.

688
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,265
Or...

689
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,699
Should I resign?

690
01:04:15,698 --> 01:04:17,698
Then we can be together in public.

691
01:04:18,514 --> 01:04:22,670
No, you can't act like everything is a toy.

692
01:04:23,879 --> 01:04:26,562
Many employees place their hopes on you.

693
01:04:37,653 --> 01:04:39,653
Can we talk about this a little later?

694
01:04:39,818 --> 01:04:41,397
I still don't want to talk.

695
01:04:42,334 --> 01:04:44,334
I want to be happy with you.

696
01:05:13,881 --> 01:05:18,405
(Ying: Now people have shared
this clip across the company!!)

697
01:05:19,141 --> 01:05:20,000
(Oh my gosh.)
(It's too hot.)

698
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,221
(He is full to the next life.)
(You can't call him Pat anymore, you have to call Mr. Pat.)

699
01:05:21,221 --> 01:05:22,037
(Too hot, he was very lucky,
I want some like that.)

700
01:07:22,755 --> 01:07:23,920
There you are!

701
01:07:24,193 --> 01:07:27,139
I tried calling your desk
but there were no answers.

702
01:07:27,516 --> 01:07:28,359
What's wrong?

703
01:07:29,411 --> 01:07:31,726
Pat submitted a resignation letter.

704
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:35,533
But I didn't approve of it.

705
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:38,390
Too late.

706
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:41,015
The president has already signed the approval.

707
01:07:50,305 --> 01:07:51,148
Ok.

708
01:07:52,305 --> 01:07:53,201
Thank you very much.

709
01:08:39,152 --> 01:08:40,360
Did you get this from Jian Group?

710
01:08:40,497 --> 01:08:41,183
Yeah.

711
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:43,963
The person in this video, it's Mr. Jeng?

712
01:08:43,963 --> 01:08:49,041
From now on, the survival of our department
will depend on online sales this quarter.

713
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:49,854
Mr. Jeng.

714
01:08:50,154 --> 01:08:52,522
I didn't leave you to face things like this.

715
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:53,481
Pat?

716
01:08:53,927 --> 01:08:55,086
The president is asking to see you.

717
01:08:58,490 --> 01:08:59,760
Dad would be shocked.

718
01:09:00,001 --> 01:09:01,640
That you liked men.

719
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:04,640
Jian Group gave their marketing budget to us.

720
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:08,496
If the result is not good,
Pat will also have to be fired.
