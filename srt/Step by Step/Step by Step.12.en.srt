1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,466
Because of the existence
of our department from now on

2
00:00:02,466 --> 00:00:05,033
will depend on online sales
in this quarter.

3
00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:06,466
I've asked for the permission from Jaab,

4
00:00:06,466 --> 00:00:09,433
to use the story of him going to
ask forgiveness from Jen in our page.

5
00:00:09,433 --> 00:00:11,100
Your idea was very good.

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:16,233
However, we can't say
that it's because of your idea

7
00:00:16,233 --> 00:00:19,200
or because of the money
you used for the injection.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,500
It hurts.

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,800
That the person we trust
doesn't even trust us.

10
00:00:26,766 --> 00:00:27,933
Let's break up.

11
00:00:30,236 --> 00:00:37,815
(Two years later)

12
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:07,300
Pat!

13
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:08,301
Huh?

14
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:12,472
Are you standing there reminiscing about the past?
Come here quickly, it's the most urgent news.

15
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,140
Okay.

16
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:14,908
Run!

17
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:16,976
Come here!

18
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,912
The two of you too!

19
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:19,746
What's up?

20
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,481
Come in, come in, everyone.

21
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,850
Come in quickly.

22
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:24,784
It's urgent!

23
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:32,859
Come on.

24
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,294
What's up

25
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:38,965
Sit, sit, sit, stop,
stop everything first, listen.

26
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,667
It's very urgent.

27
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:44,637
Pack it up.

28
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:45,805
Just a sec.

29
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,774
Oh my gosh,
did you buy this for me too?

30
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:48,875
Yes!

31
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:49,609
Good!

32
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,546
Better save it,
this is more important! Let's go!

33
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,748
Look!

34
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,385
Look over there too.

35
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:02,789
(The hottest Twitter trend today
is about Fjord.)

36
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,226
(A well-known Asian gas station company
has a new owner,)

37
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,862
(who is a famous billionaire
in the electric train industry.)

38
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:12,365
(Like Mr. Waller, people are keeping an eye
on the future of Fjord.)

39
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:15,368
(What will it be like under Mr. Waller?)

40
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:19,305
(In the year 2025,
we will definitely see changes.)

41
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:23,510
I was sure they he'd be able to close the deal,
being so rich.

42
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:26,779
Pat!

43
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:28,882
Pat!

44
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:29,382
Huh?

45
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,985
What's wrong with you?
You've been like this for a while.

46
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,821
Nothing's wrong.

47
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:38,658
So what do you think
it's going to be like?

48
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:44,998
I think after this, electric car charging stations
will pop up all over the city.

49
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,534
And with the price points,
Fjord is already standing as number 1.

50
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,435
Still more expensive than other gas stations.

51
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:55,208
And like this, do you think
they will still partner up with Jian Group?

52
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:59,078
Well, I think there will be some changes.

53
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,650
Better ask Nan.

54
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:05,618
Pat!

55
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,787
Pat, Chot!

56
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:09,022
What?

57
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,491
Do you know who I was talking to just now?

58
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:12,292
Yes.

59
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:13,927
How did you know?

60
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,495
How would I know?

61
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,963
Spill!

62
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,565
Ms. Nadia.

63
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:19,399
Narnia?

64
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,400
Nadia.

65
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,803
Huh?

66
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:24,971
Nadia from Fjord?

67
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,072
Yeah.

68
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:30,343
They said they loved your work from back then.

69
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:31,544
Hey, hey, hey.

70
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,147
And they said that...

71
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:37,350
Here, for you to go listen to their briefing
this Monday.

72
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,887
Subject: Invitation to attend the briefing...

73
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:45,458
For TV station advertising projects...
Oh please read it for me.

74
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:53,032
According to Fjord Thailand's intention to do
a project to advertise electric vehicle charging stations.

75
00:03:53,032 --> 00:04:01,941
Fjord is delighted to invite your company to attend
the Pitching Brief, on Monday 19 June.

76
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:02,976
Ugh.

77
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,777
Oh my god.

78
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,446
Fast as hell.

79
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,447
Is it great?

80
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,782
It's so great!
Why is it so amazing!?

81
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:11,818
Work!

82
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,052
Be prepared!

83
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,088
Come on, let's get to work.

84
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,290
Prepare the documents.

85
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,057
Ok.

86
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,729
I'm so happy.

87
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,530
How about you go talk to them?

88
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,967
Well, when you're on my level...

89
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:32,699
Hey, you two. Don't Fjordt to prepare the topic
that we have a meeting with.

90
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:33,866
Of course.

91
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,079
Pat.

92
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,816
Why are you so stressed out?

93
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,087
Always shaking your head.

94
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:25,718
Nan!!

95
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:31,023
I've missed you!

96
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:34,594
I've missed you so much,
we haven't seen each other in forever.

97
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:35,361
What are you doing here?

98
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,463
You got prettier.

99
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:38,898
Really?

100
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:59,652
The meeting room is ready,
please come inside.

101
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:00,653
Come on.

102
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,855
Come, Pat.

103
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,190
Quickly.

104
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:12,565
Therefore Fjord needs to go viral

105
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:17,069
as a fast, comfortable and luxurious service.

106
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:20,106
But before we go to the next section.

107
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,775
Anyone has any questions?

108
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,947
Um, who is Fjord's target
in this project?

109
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:34,654
Despite that is high and above all luxuries,
I need Fjord to be user-friendly.

110
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,622
It needs to be easy to access.

111
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:41,494
Because at the end of the day,
Fjord is about electric car users.

112
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:32,144
It's been forever since we've seen each other,
and then we suddenly run into each other.

113
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,046
Wait, wait, wait.

114
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:34,814
What?

115
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:39,652
First of all, the conclusion is that Fjord tore up
the partnership contract with Jian Group.

116
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:40,219
Uh-huh.

117
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:44,357
And hired Jian Group's in-house agency to the pitch?

118
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,057
Confused?

119
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:45,558
Confused.

120
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:48,327
This is confusing, but I don't know how
the upstairs people are dealing behind closed doors.

121
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,329
I came here because they told me to.

122
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,932
Don't tell me that person was Mr. Jeng.

123
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,601
No, Mr. Jeng was also commanded
by the higher-ups.

124
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,704
What? This is so confusing.

125
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,705
It is.

126
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,340
Where's Pat?

127
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,610
I missed him so much, I didn't get the chance
to say hi, he just disappeared.

128
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,712
He went straight to the toilet
after the meeting.

129
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:07,813
He's in the toilet?

130
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:08,748
Yes.

131
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,583
Uh.

132
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,653
Don't tell me that...

133
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,087
Yeah.

134
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,656
Where are you going?

135
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:20,526
They are finally seeing each other, shouldn't we
leave them to talk? In case things will get better.

136
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,595
I don't think so, come here.

137
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:23,729
What?

138
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,844
How are you?

139
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,119
Um, I'm...

140
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,423
Pat? Are you done?

141
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,191
Oh.

142
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,193
Mr. Jeng.

143
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:07,833
Please let me borrow Pat,
some urgent work came up.

144
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,736
Come on Pat.

145
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:00,753
Oh my, so serious.

146
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:06,425
Take it easy Pat, you work in the same industry,
you're bound to run into each other somehow.

147
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,461
It's a bit of a coincidence.

148
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:12,898
Accidentally pitching the same job
and then accidentally meeting in the toilet again.

149
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,801
So what? Do you think he's staging it?

150
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,069
Is it too much?

151
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:21,006
To the point of lobbying, Nadia to meet you?
How pretty are you?

152
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:32,118
Well, I know you're still obsessed with that.

153
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,754
But are you being pessimistic?

154
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,123
No.

155
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,724
It's just that...

156
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:39,925
Hey, wait!

157
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,728
Hey, that is Tae.

158
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,531
What are you doing here?

159
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,138
Did you hear that?

160
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,372
I can't hear.

161
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,441
Please talk to Pat for me.

162
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,509
About...

163
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,249
What are they doing?

164
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,837
I can smell someone being nosy
from a mile away.

165
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,839
Huh? Who?

166
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:28,374
You're being very normal right now.

167
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:29,475
Normal...

168
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,943
Geez...

169
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,647
What is Tae doing here?

170
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:41,320
He wants us to do an online ad to promote
Karaoke Night at Pearl and Oliver.

171
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,090
This is not a coincidence anymore.

172
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,393
Everything fits together perfectly.

173
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,096
Hey, don't get mad, calm down.

174
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:54,066
How do you know that Mr. Jeng knows
that Fjord calls us to the pitching too?

175
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,368
Wait, did Mr. Jeng go to the pitching?

176
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,904
Yeah, but I don't think it's relevant.

177
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:05,211
I think that Nadia just wants someone she used to
work with. So they will be called back to work again.

178
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:10,482
Yes, but Tae told me that
Mr. Jeng is supervising this project.

179
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:14,019
And he chose our production house,
which has nothing to do with Mr. Jeng.

180
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:17,823
They even asked if you're ok with it.

181
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,759
If you're not okay, that's okay.

182
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:25,331
Do you think it's possible
that Mr. Jeng isn't involved?

183
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:30,669
Well, this job, weren't you the one who proposed
to Mr. Jeng that you'd do it yourself?

184
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:33,472
Pat.

185
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,107
Pat.

186
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:36,642
Pat.

187
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:37,843
Over dramatic.

188
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:38,777
Hey.

189
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,947
Do I have to cancel on Tae?

190
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:42,982
Not yet.

191
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,617
I think he can do it.

192
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:45,684
He can?

193
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:46,518
What about us?

194
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:47,086
Not really.

195
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:47,953
Not at all.

196
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:51,891
Some fruit from the market.

197
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,197
I'm expecting a lot from you Jeng.

198
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,166
Yes.

199
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,702
I'll do my best, Dad.

200
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:15,547
You can do it.

201
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,216
In the past two years,
you have never missed a beat.

202
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,153
Yes.

203
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:39,138
After completing this job,
prepare yourself to become the vice president.

204
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:45,611
You are dedicated to a company to this extent,
I'm on your side.

205
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,514
And the board will vote for you.

206
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,723
Please excuse me, Dad.

207
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,159
I have to send Jaab to the airport.

208
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,858
Rich kid's problem.

209
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,828
Melodrama.

210
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,865
Live the life that your parents
have paved the way for you.

211
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,167
No freedom.

212
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:47,039
I already told you to resign last year.

213
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:52,211
Because you don't want to
inherit any business, right?

214
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:56,382
Well, at that time,
the department wasn't ready yet.

215
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,484
How can I leave everything?

216
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,389
Yep, I understand that.

217
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:07,693
But you've always done what Dad wanted
since your school days, right?

218
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,662
And you were exceptional too.

219
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,965
It's not strange that he expects things.

220
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:18,637
Dad just wants to see you walk
in the path he wants.

221
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:19,938
Yeah.

222
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,574
I know.

223
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,478
I mean, it's just like back then.

224
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:31,650
In the past when you tried to
pave the way for Pat.

225
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:59,478
And did you tell Jen that
you're going to go and see him?

226
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,448
You're not being a stalker again, right?

227
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,383
If you're caught,
I'm not going to help.

228
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:09,621
Oh, I told you, Jen already knew.

229
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,258
Jen is not like Pat.

230
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,061
That will disappear when you break up.

231
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:20,599
I have to collect everything
and send it back.

232
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,905
What?

233
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,140
It's true.

234
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,680
Come on.

235
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,050
Consider that a good sign.

236
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,419
How is it good?

237
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:41,720
Well, that he was ignoring you.

238
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,690
It shows that he still has feelings for you.

239
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,526
Hey, there's still hope.

240
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,331
Doesn't he already hate me?

241
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:53,332
Sigh.

242
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:57,769
What do you mean by hate?
Did you come up with that by yourself?

243
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:02,741
The world has already flung you
into each other's direction again.

244
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,077
Don't you want to do anything at all?

245
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,895
Let's go, I have to drop you off.

246
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,863
We won't make it in time.

247
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,810
An EV station?

248
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,613
An electric vehicle charging station.

249
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,290
Personal Brand...

250
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,478
Therefore, I think that
we should raise the issue of providing fast service.

251
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:32,584
Because the Fjord charging station has more chargers
and is more diverse than other brands.

252
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:35,520
This makes the users do not have to
wait in long queues.

253
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,824
As for our products,
there will be 3 types.

254
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:42,828
We expect to get more profit
in the next year.

255
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:50,001
We will use the power of social media to help Jaab find
the rarest peach flavor to reconcile with Jen.

256
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:52,204
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

257
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,038
Excellent!

258
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,039
Fighting.

259
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,047
Do you agree, Mr. Jeng?

260
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,250
Mr. Jeng?

261
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,985
Mr. Jeng?

262
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:08,854
Oh yes.

263
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:11,523
Oh, sorry, where were we?

264
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:16,027
Oh, I said that we should raise
the issue of speed of service.

265
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:22,434
Because Fjord charging stations have more chargers
and a lot more variety than competing brands.

266
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:28,206
It's a highlight that will allow users to use the service
without  wasting time in vain, or waiting in long queues.

267
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:32,144
But at the same time,
customers also want luxury.

268
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:36,715
The service is fast,
and customers will not waste their time.

269
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:41,286
Because time is the most valuable prophetic asset
in human life.

270
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:46,758
Time is the most valuable prophetic asset
in human life.

271
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,495
I like this word.

272
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:54,599
But what matters here is our story.

273
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,235
How do we make it go viral?

274
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:59,871
And reach all groups of people.

275
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:01,573
And then you have to look at luxury as well.

276
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,509
We have to get people
to watch it within 8 seconds.

277
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:08,914
And our narrative must be concise, fast,
and hit the heart of the audience as well.

278
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,282
Wait, Pat.

279
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:14,386
I understand the quick and easy part,
but the customers want the luxury, right?

280
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,555
Quick and easy can be luxurious.

281
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:19,624
Another thing is that we should focus
more on personal brands as well.

282
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:25,163
I think the stories that can reach all groups of people
are stories about family.

283
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:30,735
For example, this mother wants to go see
her daughter's ballet in time.

284
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:33,905
But this electric car she's driving
is running out of energy.

285
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:38,543
But she goes to Fjord's charging station and of course,
it can be recharged in time.

286
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:41,613
She went to see her daughter's
ballet performance just in time.

287
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,115
We choose a cast with a luxurious lifestyle.

288
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:47,219
Not the only one, we select many.

289
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:49,120
Many stories, and many clips.

290
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,455
So we can spread the likeability.

291
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:54,025
And like this, it's not too risky, right?
It's like we're scattering nets all over the place.

292
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:57,896
If we create a single long story
and it doesn't take off, we're done for.

293
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:58,630
You're right.

294
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,130
Hmm.

295
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,766
I said the cast has to be strong.

296
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:04,970
What if the story and cast go together?

297
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,538
The audience must like it.

298
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:10,408
Everyone has important people
that they want to spend time with.

299
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:16,047
I'm beginning to understand but
I would also like to leave a point about convenience.

300
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:20,485
Because at Fjord's charging station,
we have cafes and minimarts.

301
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:23,955
That's raised according to
the internal changes of customers.

302
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:29,494
I think we have to sell in this part too,
so it covers all the needs of customers.

303
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,863
And it will also create a good image
for the brand.

304
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,867
Or, or, we can try to add a chic, chic gimmick.

305
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:41,172
It's like hiding a QR code in a clip like this
and letting the viewer press the pause and scan it.

306
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:47,445
How are we going to tie this cafe
and mini-mart or we're going to split it into 2 parts?

307
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:54,686
Hide it in pillars, in car windows, and in cafes.
Do you want people to press pause and scan?

308
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:55,620
Yes.

309
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,623
It's good, viewers will feel engaged.

310
00:25:58,623 --> 00:25:59,090
Yeah.

311
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,127
As for gift vouchers, we can use it
in Fjord's cafe too right?

312
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:02,694
Oh.

313
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:06,831
It's good, I like the idea.
Great job.

314
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:07,399
Ok.

315
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,633
Write it down, in case I forget it.

316
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:14,272
I'd like you to go over this idea
and present it to me again.

317
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:15,240
Sure.

318
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,876
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

319
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,546
Oh, I'll take care of the story.

320
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:23,815
Because it has to go along with Fjord's sound.

321
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:34,993
Pat.

322
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:35,527
Huh?

323
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:41,333
If you're not ok with this,
I and Ae can go on the presentation day ourselves.

324
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,370
It's ok.

325
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,672
The presentation is at different times anyway.

326
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,976
Fine, up to you.

327
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,782
Get to work, everyone.

328
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:01,319
So interested in everyone's business!

329
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,526
This will increase the Fjord's popularity.

330
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:11,429
And definitely create a great image for Fjord.

331
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,234
I like it.

332
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:16,901
But...

333
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:20,238
will this be in our budget?

334
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:24,809
Don't worry, I'm confident
that this will be in our budget range.

335
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,879
Because we can control our location budget.

336
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,383
Every event takes place in the same area.

337
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:35,487
And each of our stories is
only 3 minutes long per episode.

338
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,990
So within a day,
we can shoot all 3 stories together.

339
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,627
That sounds really nice.

340
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:44,696
Can I suggest something?

341
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:45,664
Yeah.

342
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:50,001
I think since we have so many influencers,

343
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:54,773
we can use the trend
like something trendy right now in the market,

344
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:57,142
to push Fjord even more.

345
00:27:57,142 --> 00:28:00,245
Because we would like Fjord to be known more.

346
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:01,379
What do you think?

347
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:02,914
Of course.

348
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,849
Thank you very much for your advice.

349
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:06,618
You're welcome.

350
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:09,921
I'm actually really impressed
with this presentation.

351
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:13,892
I love it very much and I'm really happy
that we get to work together again.

352
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,660
Thank you, I'm glad too.

353
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:27,272
Fantastic job, Ms. Nadia was blown away!

354
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:28,006
Isn't it great?

355
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:29,441
It was amazing.

356
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,642
You're so great.

357
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:33,178
You were very well prepared.

358
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:34,045
Oh.

359
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:47,859
Could you wait me in the car?

360
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,728
Let me clear things up here first.

361
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,098
Fine.

362
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:55,700
Are you sure you're ok?

363
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,435
Yeah.

364
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,904
Go.

365
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,587
How are you?

366
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:19,758
Accidentally again.

367
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:25,463
It's not accidental,
I intended to see you.

368
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:27,298
There is something
that I want to talk to you about.

369
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:28,733
Oh.

370
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,103
How about Karaoke Night?

371
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:35,874
Karaoke Night.

372
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:39,477
Did Tae have you do it?

373
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,453
Mr. Jeng, you haven't changed at all.

374
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:51,389
It's been 2 years already.

375
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:52,624
You're still you.

376
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:56,127
Pat, I think you are misunderstanding something.

377
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,129
I really don't know about that.

378
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,639
If I don't accept this job.

379
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:12,644
Will you say
that I mix personal matters with work?

380
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:16,581
Pat.

381
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,817
Pat, listen to me first.

382
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:22,787
If I knew that you didn't like that,
why would I do it?

383
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:25,223
I don't know.

384
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,625
Isn't that something
you're really good at?

385
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,033
So many reasons...

386
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:38,403
to make me do things you want.

387
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:48,913
Pat.

388
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:21,279
Serve Table 18.

389
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:24,849
Can I talk to you?

390
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:48,706
What? I'm working.

391
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,642
Are you having Pat do a karaoke night?

392
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:55,446
Well, you said that this project,
you'd let me take care of this, didn't you?

393
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,216
Why didn't you consult me?

394
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:00,718
You know that you and I are partners.

395
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:05,857
And if I consult you,
would Pat be able to do this project?

396
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,731
See? He wouldn't.

397
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:16,167
I thought you said that you trusted me.

398
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,971
It's a different matter.

399
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,141
You know that Pat and I used to be lovers.

400
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:25,476
What were you thinking?

401
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:27,812
Do you want me and Pat to meet?

402
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,882
So what?

403
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:35,553
Then I thought that
if I got someone else to do this project.

404
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,488
It's right, isn't it?

405
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:42,160
Aren't you the one who told me
that this project was Pat's idea?

406
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:47,131
Okay, maybe it's not that unique.

407
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,168
But if this project comes out
and Pat sees it.

408
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:52,737
How do you think he would feel?

409
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,640
But you don't understand.

410
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:00,211
Well, now Pat doesn't believe me anymore.
He thinks that I'm behind everything.

411
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:05,249
Ok, I admit it was my fault
that I didn't tell you.

412
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:08,820
I'm sorry for causing trouble to you and Pat.

413
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,223
But you, you're in the wrong too.

414
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:17,028
You didn't tell him anything from the beginning.

415
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:22,700
And now I'm trying to make everything right.

416
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32,377
Uh, Tae.

417
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,212
The customers ordered drinks.

418
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:16,020
(Mr. Jeng, you haven't changed at all.)

419
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:18,423
(It's been 2 years already.)

420
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:19,824
(You're still you.)

421
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:26,531
I'm starting to doubt that the chances I'm getting
are because of my ability

422
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,000
Or because you like me.

423
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,397
Pat.

424
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,219
Chot told me everything.

425
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:36,667
It's like...

426
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:39,403
All the old feelings came back.

427
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:49,814
Now I don't know how to manage my feelings.

428
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:59,590
Why did Mr. Jeng have to do this?

429
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:07,598
Why do you think
that Mr. Jeng is the one who did it?

430
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:14,505
I know...

431
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:19,076
that you are still hurt
by the things he has done.

432
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:25,783
But if when Tae and Mr. Jeng say it is true.

433
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,519
Wouldn't that look a little silly?

434
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:36,794
But Mr. Jeng is really doing karaoke nights, Dad.

435
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,431
I think that Mr. Jeng...

436
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,234
He's probably in pain too.

437
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:48,339
And I don't think
he had the intention of hurting you.

438
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:58,249
For different people,
they have different ways of dealing with their feelings.

439
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,144
Ok?

440
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,580
Are you feeling better?

441
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:43,394
Hey, have you heard about Ying?

442
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,529
She is on the Twitter trends right now.

443
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:46,998
What did she do?

444
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:49,634
Is she being canceled by people on Twitter?

445
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:51,302
No, this.

446
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,006
Here, this one.

447
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:57,975
(#StepByStep)

448
00:37:58,042 --> 00:37:58,976
Um.

449
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,378
Well?

450
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,814
She's finally found her way.

451
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:07,051
No wonder she just resigned out of the blue.

452
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:10,788
I thought she would work for Jian Group until
she retired and died in this building.

453
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:11,289
Yeah.

454
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,491
But now she's writing Boy Love novels.

455
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:16,193
Anything that has to do with Boy Love
is really popular.

456
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:17,128
That's true.

457
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:17,628
Yeah.

458
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,929
So true.

459
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:28,039
Chot, Ae.

460
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:29,173
Huh?

461
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,542
I have something I need to tell you.

462
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:32,943
Say it.

463
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:33,944
I...

464
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:35,379
Wait, my phone is ringing.

465
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:36,947
Listen to this first.

466
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:38,883
Ah, it's Fjord.

467
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:40,718
Let's focus on this first.

468
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:42,086
Hello.

469
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:43,721
Yes, this is Broccoli House.

470
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:44,522
Yes.

471
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,393
What is it? Could you tell me first?

472
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:51,996
I've decided...

473
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,365
that I'm taking the job from Tae.

474
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,634
Pat.

475
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:59,470
Are you sure?

476
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,673
You're not going to fight in the middle
of the set, right? It's not great.

477
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,543
It'd taint the name of Broccoli House.

478
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,078
What are you arguing about?

479
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,180
I'm not that kind of person.

480
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,381
Really?

481
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:13,050
I've been able to control my emotions
for a long time.

482
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,585
Sure.

483
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:18,255
Guys, the Fjord project, we got it.

484
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:19,090
Wow, really?

485
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:19,623
It's true.

486
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:22,293
Yes! It's because of your shirt!
Did you go to make merit?

487
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:23,527
It's a fashion statement!

488
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:26,197
More ruffles than what my mother wears, geez.

489
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,565
This must be celebrated!

490
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:28,899
We got it.

491
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:34,572
Broccoli House! Broccoli House!
Broccoli House!

492
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:38,609
We finally got it.

493
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:39,777
You can reserve the restaurant now.

494
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:40,344
What restaurant?

495
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:41,212
Tonight.

496
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,179
Starting now!

497
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:47,051
I'm so excited!

498
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:55,092
As for the karaoke night section,
what do you think?

499
00:39:55,626 --> 00:40:01,065
It's okay for using a smartphone to take pictures,
it looks meaningful.

500
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:04,201
Special occasion, special night, special someone.

501
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:07,538
I think there is nothing wrong
with this tagline, right?

502
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:10,341
Because we don't have activities every day anyway.

503
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:13,444
We do it once a week
and there needs to be a reservation in advance.

504
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:18,015
But I think it needs something a little more.

505
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:23,354
There may be a slight adjustment
to make it more friendly.

506
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:24,889
Sure.

507
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:29,326
The rest is ok.

508
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:32,363
Yeah, but I have some doubts.

509
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:35,633
Why do we recommend Put?

510
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,437
I'm ok with it, I love it.

511
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,573
But I'm worried about the budget.

512
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,342
I heard the news
that he was about to go international, right?

513
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:48,245
Well, Put has his own song.

514
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:50,848
And me and Pat saw
that it was the most appropriate.

515
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:53,951
As for the price, we can negotiate the price.

516
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:58,022
Okay, if so, that's good. Good deal. Hmmm.

517
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:01,091
Yes, so only edit the tagline part, right?

518
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:01,826
Yes.

519
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,894
Yes, I'll send you an update now.

520
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:05,496
Ok.

521
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:10,034
Do you have anything to eat?

522
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:12,336
I'll have Jeng make it.

523
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:15,439
Oh? He's here?

524
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:18,108
Of course, it's Sunday so he's not at work.

525
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:22,680
Do you want anything to eat?
I'll have Jeng make it, it's on the house.

526
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,517
Oh, I'm not really hungry.

527
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:31,789
Tae?

528
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:34,758
Could I ask you something?

529
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,460
Sure.

530
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:41,732
Did you really choose my company?

531
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,602
Of course.

532
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:49,573
Because you're the person
who knows this project best.

533
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:53,210
I would feel horrible
if I chose someone else.

534
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,679
Because you were the one
who came up with this idea, right?

535
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:04,755
Could I go talk to Mr. Jeng?

536
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:16,333
Tae, you started all this.
Making them run into each other.

537
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,569
It's a good thing
he didn't get mad at me too.

538
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:21,539
It's a good thing,
they will get to clear the air.

539
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,742
Pat had the choice to choose
whether he wanted to do it or not.

540
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:30,114
In the end, no matter which way he chooses,
it will change his own world.

541
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:07,351
Congratulations.

542
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:12,356
For winning the Fjord pitch.

543
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,224
Oh.

544
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:17,394
Thank you very much.

545
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,603
I'm sorry.

546
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:30,040
That day I spoke badly to you.

547
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:34,345
I misunderstood everything.

548
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:41,318
It's okay.

549
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:44,221
I understand why you thought of it that way.

550
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:50,995
Then that day you said that
you had something to discuss with me.

551
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:53,530
Oh.

552
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:56,700
It's about karaoke night.

553
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:01,305
I didn't think that Tae would tell you first.

554
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:09,713
Mr. Jeng, please help.

555
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:15,819
I'm going to work now.

556
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:19,023
Uh.

557
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:21,792
Let's talk later.

558
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:33,737
Jeng.

559
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:44,835
(Pat, how are you?)

560
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:57,314
(Mr. Jeng, how are you?)

561
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:24,675
(I miss you.)

562
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:00,978
Now at Pearl & Oliver,
there is a karaoke night.

563
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:04,281
Don't forget to come
and sing a lot of karaoke!

564
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,718
Gosh.

565
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,020
Put is so adorable.

566
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,889
Sing by yourself, dance by yourself.

567
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,490
He's everything for us!

568
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,859
It must be a bit tiring.

569
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:21,465
Is it ok?

570
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:27,571
Yes, it's good.

571
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:30,374
Thank you.

572
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:34,177
Do you need to go somewhere next?
Please stay and eat first.

573
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:37,447
Uh, yes.

574
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:39,816
I'm free.

575
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:44,087
Can we order food now?

576
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,956
I'm starting to get hungry.

577
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:47,357
We worked hard.

578
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:54,264
They said this is really good.

579
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:00,037
How is it?

580
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,839
Amazing.

581
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:05,642
I want to take it home for my man to eat.

582
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:07,477
Can I have some?

583
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:14,184
It's so good.

584
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,287
I have something to show you.

585
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:21,258
Cute?

586
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:24,194
So cute!

587
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:26,663
He kind of looks like Jaab.

588
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:28,899
Right?

589
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:31,234
If you didn't say so,
I'd think this is Jaab's son!

590
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:34,171
Or...

591
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:36,306
Don't even think about it.

592
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:41,278
My son just likes it like this
and he just happens to look like Jaab.

593
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:44,448
I was just kidding, don't be so serious.

594
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:51,521
This is a special menu.

595
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:53,190
Shrimp nuggets.

596
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:55,759
Shrimp nuggets.

597
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:02,766
You don't like Shrimp nuggets?

598
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:06,703
It's not that I don't like your Shrimp nuggets.

599
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:10,040
But it has celery.

600
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,909
I don't like celery.

601
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:17,514
Next time when I get the chance,
let me make it up to you.

602
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:27,457
Uh, uh, uh.

603
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,259
Pat.

604
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,963
What about Mr. Jeng?
Are there any updates?

605
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:37,467
When we presented the project to Tae,
we got to talk a bit.

606
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:40,337
And?

607
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:45,042
When I got back home,
I unblocked him on everything.

608
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:50,080
But... he didn't text me.

609
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:53,617
Why didn't you text him back?

610
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:56,353
He was blocked for two whole years.

611
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:00,557
How would he know that he's been unblocked?

612
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:03,627
I'm too scared.

613
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,897
It feels strange.

614
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:09,166
I don't know.

615
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,134
Wait.

616
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:14,237
Two whole years?

617
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,038
Yes.

618
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:17,374
Blocked on everything,
the moment they broke up.

619
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:34,591
Well, even if he knew, he might not have the courage
to text you, just like you.

620
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:42,799
I'll be right back.

621
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:47,037
Pat.

622
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:51,708
Put.

623
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:53,343
I think you should check on him.

624
00:52:06,423 --> 00:52:07,891
How about shrimp nuggets?
Are we eating it?

625
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:09,025
Was I too harsh?

626
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:10,894
Right on his soft spot.

627
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:12,863
It's because of this, the Shrimp nuggets.

628
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:14,397
Are we taking responsibility for it?

629
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:15,365
Let's eat it.

630
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:11,087
I think this situation is similar
to our situation from back then.

631
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:18,094
It's not.

632
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:21,231
The reasons are totally different.

633
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,534
With Mr. Jeng.

634
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:27,804
I was the one who broke up with him.

635
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:32,108
I didn't just suddenly disappear like you.

636
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:42,419
I understand that you've broken up.

637
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:51,361
But Pat, don't you think that
the feelings of both of you ended unclearly?

638
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:57,000
But if it's cleared up,
it might hurt even more.

639
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,074
And if it's not clear...

640
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,342
Doesn't it hurt?

641
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:18,488
Just like that time.

642
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:22,092
Once I understood myself,
I was ready to come back to you.

643
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,727
You blocked me.

644
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:26,963
But when I had a chance.

645
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:29,566
I followed you without stopping.

646
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:34,804
So what should I do?

647
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:40,543
It's been such a long time.

648
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:47,050
If you still care about him,

649
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:49,586
and still have feelings for him.

650
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:53,490
Don't you want to clear things up with him?

651
00:54:58,028 --> 00:55:00,030
I think it's not too late,

652
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:03,266
and another thing is...

653
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,468
Mr. Jeng, he...

654
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:09,973
still feels the same way about you.

655
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:56,953
Cheers!

656
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:17,140
You can ask me.

657
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,543
What have you been talking about?

658
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:21,311
Spill!

659
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:25,615
Well...

660
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,788
it's a personal matter.

661
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:33,990
Okay, do you hear that Chot?

662
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:36,092
It's a personal matter, hmm.

663
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:37,160
I heard it with you.

664
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,395
Ok.

665
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:42,866
Where's Pat?

666
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:44,033
He's outside.

667
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:47,537
You're always so slow.

668
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:49,439
There.

669
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:50,140
Huh.

670
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,408
He's here.

671
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:52,542
Pat?

672
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:56,179
Look.

673
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,248
Look at his gesture.

674
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:03,653
What's wrong?

675
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:07,891
He's in the mood to sing?

676
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:10,059
Ah ok.

677
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:13,229
Applaud him!

678
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:14,397
That's great honey.

679
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:54,130
I think that Mr. Jeng's restaurant
should have more activities like this.

680
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,866
If I really organized it.

681
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:59,335
You have to go up and sing a song.

682
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:00,904
Sure.

683
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:03,907
And people will all leave the restaurant.

684
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:06,409
But I'll still be there.

685
00:59:42,645 --> 00:59:44,447
Go follow him.

686
00:59:44,447 --> 00:59:45,048
Go, Pat!!

687
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:46,449
Why are you standing around for?

688
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:47,050
Go.

689
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:48,785
Go follow him.

690
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:50,987
Hold this.

691
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:52,121
Do I have to sing?

692
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:54,724
Oh.

693
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:17,880
Mr. Jeng.

694
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:27,290
Thank you for doing as you promised.

695
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:36,766
Why are you running away from me?

696
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:41,070
I'm sorry.

697
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:44,040
I can't stand it.

698
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:53,616
What's wrong with you?

699
01:00:59,522 --> 01:01:02,592
I have so many things I want to tell you.

700
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,665
I want to apologize to you.

701
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:14,537
Apologize about what?

702
01:01:15,038 --> 01:01:17,040
I should be the one apologizing.

703
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:20,309
No.

704
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,679
I'm the one who should be apologizing.

705
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:27,083
For when I disappeared from your life.

706
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,526
But back then...

707
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:40,129
I thought that was the best choice.

708
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,568
Yes.

709
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:50,807
But I was being stupid,

710
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:54,744
I shouldn't have done that.

711
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:02,819
It's ok, I understand you.

712
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:07,757
What I did was not great.

713
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:12,729
It's not strange at all
that you would hate me.

714
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:15,064
No.

715
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:17,633
I don't hate you.

716
01:02:18,134 --> 01:02:20,136
I never hated you.

717
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:23,272
What made you think that I hated you?

718
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:26,175
Well, I hurt your feelings.

719
01:02:28,144 --> 01:02:29,312
No.

720
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:34,484
At that time, I was just angry
about what you did to me.

721
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:37,286
So I walked out.

722
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:43,259
But now I know
that what I thought was wrong.

723
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,766
Anyway, I'm sorry.

724
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,868
No need to apologize.

725
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,937
I'm not angry anymore.

726
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:57,874
We both hurt each other, right?

727
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:00,810
Yes.

728
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:07,850
I don't want our relationship
to end like this.

729
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:11,554
So will it be possible?

730
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:18,361
If the two of us will
learn about each other again.

731
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:24,000
Let's start all over again.

732
01:03:35,044 --> 01:03:37,046
But I'm afraid.

733
01:03:38,347 --> 01:03:40,349
I'm afraid that I would hurt you again.

734
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,955
I'm also afraid
that I might act irrationally with you again.

735
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:53,296
That's why...

736
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:57,466
we should give each other another chance.

737
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:06,409
A chance.

738
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:14,550
So...

739
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:17,954
Do you still like me?

740
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:59,428
I think we should talk about this another day.

741
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,899
You're drunk.

742
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:07,837
I'm not drunk.

743
01:05:09,772 --> 01:05:11,207
There it is.

744
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:13,843
You're drunk.

745
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,216
Are you trying to get me to go away?

746
01:05:20,216 --> 01:05:22,251
I'm not.

747
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:28,758
You should go home now,
your Dad will be worried.

748
01:05:29,992 --> 01:05:31,961
I'll see you at your house tomorrow.

749
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:34,330
Can I?

750
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,202
Please?

751
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:44,140
Fine.

752
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,642
If you're being like this.

753
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:49,879
I'll go home first.

754
01:05:51,747 --> 01:05:53,716
But promise,

755
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:56,352
that you'll come and see me tomorrow.

756
01:05:58,421 --> 01:05:59,355
Yes.

757
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,125
See you then.

758
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:37,560
Then I'm going home now.

759
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:38,761
Ok.

760
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:42,365
See you.

761
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:00,950
Don't forget!

762
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:02,651
I won't forget.

763
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:04,387
See you tomorrow.

764
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:26,809
Oh, Mr. Jeng.

765
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:27,343
Hello, Father.

766
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:27,843
Hello.

767
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:29,545
Is Pat home?

768
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:31,647
Oh, he's inside,
but he hasn't woken up yet.

769
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:33,849
Come on in.

770
01:07:37,753 --> 01:07:38,888
Come on in.

771
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:48,898
Have you eaten anything yet?

772
01:07:57,339 --> 01:07:58,140
Mr. Jeng?

773
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:01,444
Oh, it's ok.

774
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:03,612
I've eaten already.

775
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:06,215
Let me go get Pat for you.

776
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:06,949
Thank you.

777
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:12,121
Oh, he's here. Mr. Jeng is here to see you.

778
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:29,605
Ah, I'm going out to play tennis.

779
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:33,642
See you soon.

780
01:08:34,343 --> 01:08:35,144
Ok.

781
01:08:52,661 --> 01:08:54,663
I made fish porridge for you.

782
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:11,814
You can blow it first, it's hot.

783
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:17,386
So why didn't you say so sooner?

784
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:30,065
How is it?

785
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:31,867
Is it delicious?

786
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:34,637
It's delicious.

787
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:36,305
I like it.

788
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:42,178
Thank you so much for accepting this job.

789
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:43,579
Yes.

790
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:47,049
In fact, I heard from Chot that,

791
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:49,418
he was leaving to open an agency company with you.

792
01:09:50,085 --> 01:09:53,289
So I secretly thought that I probably wouldn't have
the opportunity to work with you again,

793
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:55,391
until I had the opportunity.

794
01:09:57,393 --> 01:10:00,062
Ah, what's the opportunity?

795
01:10:00,996 --> 01:10:02,665
Pat, do you remember?

796
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:08,938
I can't, I was really drunk last night.

797
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:17,580
So let's do as agreed, right?

798
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:23,118
What was our agreement, I can't remember.

799
01:10:24,186 --> 01:10:26,188
I was really drunk last night.

800
01:10:42,972 --> 01:10:44,106
Hello.

801
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:49,144
What's your name?

802
01:10:49,144 --> 01:10:51,747
Well, I would like to get to know you.

803
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:54,283
What's wrong with you, Mr. Jeng?

804
01:10:56,218 --> 01:10:58,320
How did you know my name?

805
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:02,725
Do we know each other?

806
01:11:05,628 --> 01:11:06,895
Fine.

807
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:08,897
I'll play along.

808
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:11,100
Pat.

809
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:13,202
Your name is Pat.

810
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,906
My name is Jeng.

811
01:11:21,176 --> 01:11:23,178
Nice to meet you,

812
01:11:24,046 --> 01:11:26,048
again.

813
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:37,626
Nice to meet you.

814
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:40,696
So...

815
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:43,499
Do you have a boyfriend?

816
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:47,236
I want to ask...

817
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:49,738
Don't ask me.

818
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,309
Let's take it slow.

819
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:56,011
Ok.

820
01:11:56,912 --> 01:11:58,213
Let's take it step by step.

821
01:11:58,213 --> 01:11:58,981
Uh.

822
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:10,092
How was it?

823
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:13,295
It was pretty good.

824
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:14,630
Do you want to give it another try?

825
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:16,298
No!

826
01:12:35,651 --> 01:12:36,785
Well?

827
01:12:50,799 --> 01:12:54,536
I'm going to resign
and I'll return all of my shares to you.

828
01:12:57,239 --> 01:12:59,241
What have I done to make you unsatisfied?

829
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:02,044
Why don't we talk it out?

830
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:03,345
No.

831
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:07,049
I don't want to inherit the family business anyway.

832
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:09,685
I have my dreams.

833
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:12,588
Then you suddenly come
and leave us like this?

834
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,225
It's not about your dream.

835
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:19,661
It's more about that kid named Pat.

836
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:25,467
Either way, one day I have to resign anyway.

837
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:56,565
If there's nothing else to say.

838
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:59,101
Why don't you get out?

839
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:30,699
Oh, try it and see if it's delicious.

840
01:14:44,713 --> 01:14:45,981
Wow.

841
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:49,384
It's the most delicious green curry in the universe.

842
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:02,631
The amount of water is not thick or greasy.

843
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,268
But it's not faded and dull.

844
01:15:06,268 --> 01:15:08,136
It has a strong flavor.

845
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:12,341
Oh man, how much I love this sót-able composition.

846
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:16,612
Yeah.

847
01:15:17,145 --> 01:15:20,716
The curry spices
have a perfect combination of flavors.

848
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:25,654
The chef has carefully selected
the right amount of spices and herbs.

849
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:28,624
Yes.

850
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:31,126
But this is store-bought.

851
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:37,332
It is considered that the chef has a sharp eye
in choosing his ingredients.

852
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:40,102
Well done, Chef.

853
01:15:40,903 --> 01:15:42,070
Thank you.

854
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:44,439
Let Chef taste it, please.

855
01:15:56,752 --> 01:15:57,653
Hmmm.

856
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,354
It really is delicious!

857
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:05,227
Pat.

858
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:05,894
Huh?

859
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:10,165
I have resigned from Jian Group.

860
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:19,207
So is the president okay with that?

861
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:22,844
He seemed fine.

862
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:26,014
But I think it's too easy.

863
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:29,518
I think that Dad must have some kind of plan.

864
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:37,893
It's okay.

865
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:41,763
That we just have to hug each other even tighter.

866
01:16:50,539 --> 01:16:51,740
Okay.

867
01:16:56,011 --> 01:16:59,281
Hmm, are you worried about the department?

868
01:16:59,848 --> 01:17:01,817
If you're not there.

869
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:04,486
No.

870
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:08,123
I trust Nan.

871
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:10,225
She's very talented.

872
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:20,769
Ohh.

873
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:24,006
Let's eat.

874
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:25,107
Ok.

875
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:19,761
Happy birthday to you.

876
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:24,266
Happy birthday to you.

877
01:18:24,266 --> 01:18:29,471
Happy birthday. Happy birthday.

878
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:36,111
Happy birthday to you.

879
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:38,046
Did Dad tell you?

880
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:40,782
That I like to eat crispy pork cake.

881
01:18:42,617 --> 01:18:44,753
I wish you all the happiness in the world.

882
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:46,955
Thank you so much.

883
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:50,559
Make a wish.

884
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:51,393
Okay.

885
01:19:00,702 --> 01:19:01,203
Ah.

886
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:04,172
Happy birthday.

887
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:25,026
Thank you.

888
01:19:25,026 --> 01:19:25,894
Yes.

889
01:19:26,294 --> 01:19:27,829
Let's take a selfie.

890
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:40,075
Let's take a boomerang too.

891
01:19:45,247 --> 01:19:46,014
Ok.

892
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:47,883
It looks so delicious!

893
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:49,384
I wish you all the happiness in the world.

894
01:19:49,384 --> 01:19:50,385
Thank you.

895
01:20:14,209 --> 01:20:15,677
Don't worry.

896
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:18,146
My mama is really kind.

897
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:20,916
You've met her before, don't you remember?

898
01:20:26,188 --> 01:20:27,656
Have the croissants first.

899
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:31,827
No, no, I can't eat.

900
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:40,836
Your tea is here.

901
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:48,510
Whose tea is this?

902
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,612
We didn't order tea.

903
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:53,348
This means that my mama is here.

904
01:21:02,457 --> 01:21:04,125
Hello.

905
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:05,360
Hi.

906
01:21:06,428 --> 01:21:08,430
Please sit. Your tea is here.

907
01:21:14,769 --> 01:21:16,238
Hello.

908
01:21:16,805 --> 01:21:18,006
Hi.

909
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:42,464
Where do you work?

910
01:21:42,864 --> 01:21:44,532
How old are you?

911
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:47,969
Ah, yes.

912
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:50,405
I just opened my own agency.

913
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:54,242
Now I'm taking care of
the strategic marketing plans.

914
01:21:54,442 --> 01:21:58,680
As for my age, I'll be 26 at the end of October.

915
01:22:00,282 --> 01:22:04,152
It's good that you own a business
from a young age.

916
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:08,456
Pat is now in charge of the Fjord Project.

917
01:22:20,335 --> 01:22:24,205
I need to go now,
please take care of your friend.

918
01:22:24,205 --> 01:22:24,706
Yes.

919
01:22:27,909 --> 01:22:28,677
See you soon.

920
01:22:28,677 --> 01:22:30,045
Goodbye.

921
01:22:40,822 --> 01:22:42,157
What are you smiling at?

922
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:45,293
Why did you say that she's kind and friendly?

923
01:22:48,697 --> 01:22:50,699
She's just not used to you yet.

924
01:22:51,066 --> 01:22:54,169
But this is friendlier than usual.

925
01:22:55,003 --> 01:22:57,005
Let's have a meal next time.

926
01:22:57,305 --> 01:22:58,640
You'll be close soon.

927
01:22:59,774 --> 01:23:02,644
But she called me your friend.

928
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:05,480
It hurts a bit.

929
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:09,684
It's like she thinks we're not serious.

930
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:21,262
So what should we do?

931
01:23:27,702 --> 01:23:29,437
We don't have to do anything.

932
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:34,142
Last night, I spoke with my mother.

933
01:23:34,909 --> 01:23:36,911
She said that...

934
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:41,282
I don't have to do anything.

935
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:46,021
If I do too much, she'll get frustrated.

936
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:49,024
Give her some time.

937
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:52,394
Let it go and it'll be okay.

938
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:58,133
But what you said, it might be true.

939
01:24:03,605 --> 01:24:06,541
Why are you laughing? Am I funny?

940
01:24:07,742 --> 01:24:09,077
No.

941
01:24:09,577 --> 01:24:11,780
It just really seems like advice
that would come from your mom.

942
01:24:17,085 --> 01:24:18,386
Drink some tea.

943
01:24:18,953 --> 01:24:20,155
Drink it.

944
01:24:38,473 --> 01:24:41,943
Happy birthday to you.

945
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:46,448
Happy birthday to you.

946
01:24:46,781 --> 01:24:51,953
Happy birthday. Happy birthday.

947
01:24:53,354 --> 01:24:58,393
Happy birthday to you.

948
01:24:59,527 --> 01:25:01,529
Make a wish before blowing out the candles.

949
01:25:19,347 --> 01:25:21,282
What kind of cake is that?

950
01:25:21,282 --> 01:25:23,084
Oh, it's fruit cake.

951
01:25:23,084 --> 01:25:25,687
I really broke the norms for baking,

952
01:25:25,687 --> 01:25:33,795
giving you the experience and taste of whipped cream
that I beat too much that it separated into butter.

953
01:25:37,499 --> 01:25:41,102
The inside part here is a special layer.

954
01:25:41,603 --> 01:25:48,409
Mixed with the sweet and sour taste of fresh fruit
to cut with the sweetness of the cream.

955
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:51,646
I don't want you to feel repetitive.

956
01:25:52,614 --> 01:25:54,616
So I baked a cake that...

957
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:56,684
was...

958
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:00,655
not baked all the way through...

959
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:04,325
somewhat medium rare.

960
01:26:16,404 --> 01:26:19,340
It's ok, but I think that...

961
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:23,745
Pat.

962
01:26:23,945 --> 01:26:25,280
What's wrong?

963
01:26:26,247 --> 01:26:27,916
Let me taste it.

964
01:26:31,452 --> 01:26:33,454
Uh, it's pretty good.

965
01:26:33,454 --> 01:26:35,056
That's not true.

966
01:26:35,056 --> 01:26:36,891
It's true, it's good.

967
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:38,893
You're lying.

968
01:26:38,893 --> 01:26:40,295
It's edible.

969
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:40,895
It tastes great.

970
01:26:40,895 --> 01:26:42,263
It's just ok.

971
01:26:42,263 --> 01:26:43,464
Delicious.

972
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:45,600
Delicious.

973
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:46,634
I do not believe you.

974
01:26:46,634 --> 01:26:47,569
It's true.

975
01:26:48,236 --> 01:26:49,470
It's delicious.

976
01:27:00,548 --> 01:27:02,550
Hmmm, Jeng!

977
01:27:03,484 --> 01:27:04,619
It's messy!

978
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:05,587
I don't see any mess.

979
01:27:05,587 --> 01:27:07,188
It's messy!

980
01:27:07,522 --> 01:27:09,023
I don't see any mess.

981
01:27:09,023 --> 01:27:09,891
I don't see any mess!

982
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:11,359
Jeng!

983
01:27:13,261 --> 01:27:14,729
It's all messy.

984
01:27:26,774 --> 01:27:28,243
Thank you so much.

985
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:30,445
For baking me a cake.

986
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:34,582
Your mouth is all messed up.

987
01:27:34,949 --> 01:27:35,883
Really?

988
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:43,157
Take it back.

989
01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:44,692
Don't take it, don't take it.

990
01:27:47,028 --> 01:27:48,162
Fine.

991
01:29:04,138 --> 01:29:05,873
Content shooting?

992
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:10,912
Can I share it with my Close Friends?

993
01:29:12,714 --> 01:29:13,981
Are you sure?

994
01:29:15,783 --> 01:29:17,785
I want to show off my boyfriend.

995
01:29:17,785 --> 01:29:19,387
Please?

996
01:29:19,387 --> 01:29:21,422
Please? Please? Please? Please?

997
01:29:21,422 --> 01:29:22,790
Please?

998
01:29:23,424 --> 01:29:26,561
Let me see the picture first
before you post it.

999
01:29:27,929 --> 01:29:28,996
Um.

1000
01:29:30,898 --> 01:29:32,100
Oh.

1001
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:35,536
Can't you choose another picture?

1002
01:29:35,536 --> 01:29:37,038
It's cute.

1003
01:29:37,305 --> 01:29:38,639
It's not handsome at all.

1004
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:40,575
Why? It's cute!

1005
01:29:40,575 --> 01:29:42,043
It's not cute, delete it!

1006
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:43,444
Why?

1007
01:29:43,778 --> 01:29:45,046
I'm not handsome in this picture.

1008
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:46,948
You're already cute in it.

1009
01:29:46,948 --> 01:29:47,682
No.

1010
01:29:52,186 --> 01:29:53,788
Don't!

1011
01:29:53,788 --> 01:29:54,622
Why?

1012
01:29:54,622 --> 01:29:56,791
I haven't brushed my teeth yet.

1013
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:58,259
It's fine.

1014
01:29:58,259 --> 01:30:00,027
My breath stinks.

1015
01:30:01,195 --> 01:30:02,163
No.

1016
01:30:02,163 --> 01:30:02,897
It doesn't.

1017
01:30:03,831 --> 01:30:05,099
It stinks.

1018
01:30:05,099 --> 01:30:06,000
It doesn't.

1019
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,402
Don't, wait.

1020
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:07,969
Why?

1021
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:09,203
It stinks.

1022
01:30:09,203 --> 01:30:10,304
It stinks?

1023
01:30:11,105 --> 01:30:12,507
It stinks!

1024
01:30:12,507 --> 01:30:13,241
It doesn't.

1025
01:30:20,648 --> 01:30:22,383
What time is it?

1026
01:30:22,383 --> 01:30:24,118
It's morning time.

1027
01:31:00,688 --> 01:31:02,657
Let me take off the shirt for you.

1028
01:32:27,642 --> 01:32:28,643
Ow.

1029
01:32:30,044 --> 01:32:31,579
Why did you bite me?

1030
01:32:34,448 --> 01:32:35,850
Hmm.

1031
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:46,727
Go.

1032
01:32:47,795 --> 01:32:49,263
Let's take a shower.

1033
01:33:23,464 --> 01:33:25,466
Are you awake?

1034
01:33:26,701 --> 01:33:28,169
It's very late.

1035
01:33:29,103 --> 01:33:31,105
Ummm.

1036
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:33,941
Can I sleep in?

1037
01:33:35,710 --> 01:33:37,712
I'm still sleepy.

1038
01:33:52,193 --> 01:33:53,494
Jeng.

1039
01:33:55,930 --> 01:33:57,331
Get up.

1040
01:33:58,165 --> 01:33:59,400
No.

1041
01:34:01,836 --> 01:34:04,972
Come on, wake up, and get up quickly.

1042
01:34:10,311 --> 01:34:12,313
Your hair is all messed up now.

1043
01:34:12,313 --> 01:34:13,314
Jeng!

1044
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:16,250
How did you sleep to get your hair like that?

1045
01:34:17,418 --> 01:34:18,586
I'm gonna bite you.

1046
01:34:28,562 --> 01:34:30,064
Jeng!

1047
01:34:32,299 --> 01:34:34,468
Ok, I surrender.

1048
01:34:34,468 --> 01:34:35,469
Really?

1049
01:34:40,841 --> 01:34:42,843
Can I rest for a while?

1050
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:46,514
Come.

1051
01:34:48,482 --> 01:34:50,484
Call it a truce.

1052
01:34:51,719 --> 01:34:52,720
Fine.

1053
01:34:55,623 --> 01:34:57,625
Do you like this kind of interior?

1054
01:35:01,796 --> 01:35:03,798
Umm, I like it.

1055
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:07,835
Do you like it?

1056
01:35:09,036 --> 01:35:10,104
I like it.

1057
01:35:10,404 --> 01:35:11,539
I like it very much.

1058
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:13,040
I like everything.

1059
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:16,844
It's not too modern.

1060
01:35:17,178 --> 01:35:18,479
It's really timeless.

1061
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:19,680
It's pretty cozy.

1062
01:35:22,016 --> 01:35:23,084
Yeah.

1063
01:35:23,084 --> 01:35:24,118
I agree.

1064
01:35:28,556 --> 01:35:31,025
Why are you making that face?

1065
01:35:31,592 --> 01:35:33,594
I have to go to the set tomorrow.

1066
01:35:34,829 --> 01:35:36,831
I wish you could go too.

1067
01:35:39,133 --> 01:35:41,268
I have to go to the restaurant tomorrow.

1068
01:35:41,268 --> 01:35:42,937
Tae's not here.

1069
01:35:43,404 --> 01:35:45,406
No.

1070
01:35:46,741 --> 01:35:48,142
It's ok.

1071
01:35:48,142 --> 01:35:48,943
No.

1072
01:35:49,477 --> 01:35:50,678
I'll buy you some snacks.

1073
01:35:52,146 --> 01:35:53,314
What do you want to eat?

1074
01:35:53,981 --> 01:35:55,983
Grass jelly or bubble tea?

1075
01:35:56,484 --> 01:35:57,485
Both.

1076
01:35:58,486 --> 01:35:59,487
Fine.

1077
01:36:00,387 --> 01:36:00,921
Deal!

1078
01:36:00,921 --> 01:36:02,323
Pinky promise?

1079
01:36:02,323 --> 01:36:02,990
Yes.

1080
01:36:04,959 --> 01:36:05,926
You promised!

1081
01:36:06,127 --> 01:36:08,095
Ok, I did.

1082
01:36:44,031 --> 01:36:45,299
Why are you smiling?

1083
01:36:50,471 --> 01:36:52,006
If you're not eating...

1084
01:36:52,006 --> 01:36:53,274
Can I have it?

1085
01:36:53,274 --> 01:36:55,609
Sure, you can have the whole glass.

1086
01:36:55,609 --> 01:36:58,813
I'm just kidding.

1087
01:36:58,813 --> 01:37:00,080
Jeng!

1088
01:37:00,781 --> 01:37:02,783
Are you going to give me everything?

1089
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:08,722
Do you know that every time I eat grass jelly.

1090
01:37:11,125 --> 01:37:13,127
I always think of that day.

1091
01:37:38,886 --> 01:37:40,888
I'm sorry, please let me...

1092
01:38:00,341 --> 01:38:01,909
Why do you think about it?

1093
01:38:02,209 --> 01:38:04,211
It's so embarrassing!

1094
01:38:04,378 --> 01:38:05,846
It's not.

1095
01:38:06,881 --> 01:38:08,315
It's the first impression.

1096
01:38:08,515 --> 01:38:09,783
See?

1097
01:38:10,851 --> 01:38:12,853
The more you talk about it,
the more you feel shy.

1098
01:38:17,691 --> 01:38:19,293
I think you feel more shy.

1099
01:38:19,293 --> 01:38:20,327
That's not true.

1100
01:38:20,327 --> 01:38:21,729
It is.

1101
01:38:22,162 --> 01:38:23,163
Mr. Jeng!

1102
01:38:23,163 --> 01:38:23,864
Right?

1103
01:38:24,265 --> 01:38:25,432
No.

1104
01:38:27,201 --> 01:38:27,935
Are you shy?

1105
01:38:27,935 --> 01:38:28,836
Eat it.

1106
01:38:29,103 --> 01:38:30,037
Eat all of it.

1107
01:38:37,011 --> 01:38:38,012
Jeng.

1108
01:38:38,412 --> 01:38:39,413
Yes?

1109
01:38:41,548 --> 01:38:43,751
I want to live like this every day.

1110
01:38:45,719 --> 01:38:48,722
In the future, we have a home.

1111
01:38:49,423 --> 01:38:51,859
And you bring me to buy things here.

1112
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:53,427
Everything.

1113
01:38:53,794 --> 01:38:55,129
Everything!

1114
01:38:57,431 --> 01:38:58,899
All of it?

1115
01:38:58,899 --> 01:38:59,400
Yes.

1116
01:39:01,135 --> 01:39:02,269
Of course.

1117
01:39:02,803 --> 01:39:04,805
If one day, we really have a home.

1118
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:08,542
I'll bring you here to buy everything,
how does that sound?

1119
01:39:12,012 --> 01:39:14,615
Ah, but...

1120
01:39:16,116 --> 01:39:19,520
The future, when is that?

1121
01:39:21,522 --> 01:39:23,524
When is it?

1122
01:39:26,093 --> 01:39:28,095
I hope it's soon.

1123
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:34,702
Jeng.

1124
01:39:35,703 --> 01:39:37,705
Should we go check out that zone?

1125
01:39:38,305 --> 01:39:40,274
Let's go.
