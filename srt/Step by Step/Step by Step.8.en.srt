1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,193
Do you like me?

2
00:00:05,107 --> 00:00:06,401
Jaab.

3
00:00:06,401 --> 00:00:08,133
Can I talk to you for a bit?

4
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:11,289
You don't have to say anything else.

5
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:12,752
You can just text me.

6
00:00:12,752 --> 00:00:13,681
It's ok.

7
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:21,207
I'm so sorry, I couldn't help you at all.

8
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:24,588
You can tell me when you're ready.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,645
Put, I need to talk to you about something.

10
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,144
I'm ready to give you the answer.

11
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,711
I love you, Pat.

12
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:16,996
You're such a cheat!

13
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,913
Don't say that, ok?

14
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:23,494
I'm being serious.

15
00:01:25,054 --> 00:01:26,447
I just want you to know,

16
00:01:27,828 --> 00:01:30,380
that I will never change no matter what.

17
00:01:40,277 --> 00:01:41,550
Can I say something now?

18
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:51,117
What if I said you couldn't?

19
00:01:59,525 --> 00:02:01,304
I think I already know your answer.

20
00:02:06,706 --> 00:02:07,657
Why, Pat?

21
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,801
Have I done anything wrong?

22
00:02:12,227 --> 00:02:14,834
I haven't even taken you for granted as I did two years ago.

23
00:02:18,414 --> 00:02:19,586
I know.

24
00:02:20,861 --> 00:02:22,474
You've been really good to me.

25
00:02:22,961 --> 00:02:24,022
But I...

26
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,000
I don't really know how I feel.

27
00:02:33,831 --> 00:02:35,058
But what I'm really sure of,

28
00:02:36,097 --> 00:02:38,981
it's that I don't have the same feeling for you anymore.

29
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:49,041
And you can't even make up what you did with
what you've been doing now.

30
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:08,805
It's just like that, right?

31
00:03:12,605 --> 00:03:16,096
So is there anything I can do to change your mind?

32
00:03:32,976 --> 00:03:34,313
Or now do you like someone else?

33
00:03:39,172 --> 00:03:40,509
No.

34
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:45,508
And it's not what you think for sure.

35
00:04:10,788 --> 00:04:13,395
Thank you for everything, Put.

36
00:05:39,777 --> 00:05:41,114
I think we need more light.

37
00:05:41,412 --> 00:05:43,522
Right. I want the model to look brighter.

38
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,311
So I think we should add more light on this side,

39
00:05:46,549 --> 00:05:48,549
and rotate it a bit, or his face will look too bright.

40
00:05:49,763 --> 00:05:52,260
Turn your body 45 degree to the camera.

41
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:52,823
Ah!

42
00:05:53,272 --> 00:05:54,168
Great!

43
00:05:54,168 --> 00:05:54,916
Ok.

44
00:05:55,436 --> 00:05:58,099
Wow! Look at your clothes, sis!

45
00:05:58,513 --> 00:05:59,574
How cool!

46
00:05:59,574 --> 00:06:00,264
Really?

47
00:06:00,264 --> 00:06:00,863
Yeah.

48
00:06:00,863 --> 00:06:02,503
I'm a denim girl.

49
00:06:02,883 --> 00:06:03,944
Buy one for me, please.

50
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,318
Fine. I'll buy you one.

51
00:06:06,705 --> 00:06:07,602
So we can do a matching outfit.

52
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:09,573
What's with that stuff?

53
00:06:09,573 --> 00:06:10,986
Eh? Can't we?

54
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:12,201
It's not that we can't, but...

55
00:06:13,185 --> 00:06:14,578
Can I ask you something?

56
00:06:15,102 --> 00:06:15,666
Yeah.

57
00:06:17,223 --> 00:06:20,383
There's something going on between you and Put, right?

58
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,029
You lie to me and go to hell.

59
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:29,464
How's it going?

60
00:06:34,553 --> 00:06:35,559
Well, that's true.

61
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,378
But we've stopped it now.

62
00:06:38,378 --> 00:06:38,917
What?

63
00:06:39,537 --> 00:06:40,433
Why?

64
00:06:44,072 --> 00:06:48,723
I really wanna know, so is there someone to tell me here?

65
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:51,817
Hello. Hello.

66
00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:52,317
Wow!

67
00:06:52,317 --> 00:06:53,628
Hello. Hello. Hello.

68
00:06:54,266 --> 00:06:54,941
Hello.

69
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,628
Hello, Put.

70
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:10,302
Where am I supposed to go?

71
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,489
Hey, tell me.

72
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:14,314
Hello. Hello.

73
00:07:14,314 --> 00:07:16,227
Hello.
Hello.

74
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,282
This way, please.

75
00:07:17,282 --> 00:07:18,810
Ok. Here, right?

76
00:07:20,602 --> 00:07:21,102
Thanks.

77
00:07:21,102 --> 00:07:22,622
I think it works now, right?

78
00:07:22,951 --> 00:07:26,166
Well, so I'm gonna go to the toilet now. Ok?

79
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:30,276
Wow! Hello, Mr. Jeng.

80
00:07:30,705 --> 00:07:32,318
You just walked in here like a cat.

81
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:34,918
Hello, Mr. Jeng.

82
00:07:35,405 --> 00:07:36,411
Hello.

83
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:47,993
Ok.

84
00:07:47,993 --> 00:07:49,209
One more.

85
00:07:50,392 --> 00:07:52,889
Please smile and be more lively.

86
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:53,389
Ok.

87
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:56,640
Ok.

88
00:07:57,429 --> 00:08:00,644
Well, Put has been here, but why is Jarb still not here?

89
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,807
Umm... I don't know either, Jen.

90
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:06,544
He's coming soon, I guess.

91
00:08:10,001 --> 00:08:11,283
I think it's quite good, Jen.

92
00:08:22,929 --> 00:08:23,769
Pat,

93
00:08:26,455 --> 00:08:28,786
do you still remember your promise?

94
00:08:29,428 --> 00:08:30,986
Pardon, Mr. Jeng.

95
00:08:31,538 --> 00:08:34,647
I didn't hear you quite well.

96
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:38,168
Well,

97
00:08:40,439 --> 00:08:41,114
when you...

98
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,422
Never mind.

99
00:08:48,406 --> 00:08:49,743
You might forget it, I suppose.

100
00:08:57,782 --> 00:08:59,340
You daren't call on me, right?

101
00:09:07,282 --> 00:09:08,730
Can we postpone it now?

102
00:09:09,714 --> 00:09:11,548
I've been quite busy these days.

103
00:09:19,287 --> 00:09:20,000
Ok. Let's begin.

104
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,902
Let's try it.

105
00:09:22,143 --> 00:09:22,643
Yeah.

106
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,544
Show them right to the camera.

107
00:09:26,544 --> 00:09:27,375
Get them to the front.

108
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,778
Just like this, Put.

109
00:09:29,706 --> 00:09:30,206
Yeah, that's good.

110
00:09:30,206 --> 00:09:30,812
Well done.

111
00:09:33,544 --> 00:09:35,157
Move to the left a bit, Put.

112
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:38,914
Where is Jarb now, though?

113
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:43,491
Put has been here for so long, so where on earth is he now?

114
00:09:44,023 --> 00:09:44,919
I don't know either.

115
00:09:48,174 --> 00:09:49,732
Speak of the devil!

116
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,954
Hey, bro.

117
00:09:50,954 --> 00:09:51,782
That devil.

118
00:09:53,081 --> 00:09:53,811
Hello.

119
00:09:53,811 --> 00:09:54,426
Hello, Jarb.

120
00:09:54,748 --> 00:09:56,141
Hello. Hello. Hello.

121
00:09:58,918 --> 00:10:00,000
How's it going?

122
00:10:06,977 --> 00:10:08,977
Didn't you tell me Jen is working in Ton's crew?

123
00:10:10,547 --> 00:10:11,599
Well...

124
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:13,599
Not asked me to come and help your crew out instead.

125
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:22,914
I just told him to transfer Jen to another crew.

126
00:10:23,235 --> 00:10:24,738
Please tell Jarb for me,

127
00:10:24,738 --> 00:10:29,347
that he doesn't need to avoid me,
for after a while, I will not be here any longer.

128
00:10:30,306 --> 00:10:31,422
What do you mean?

129
00:10:32,617 --> 00:10:33,568
Well...

130
00:10:35,297 --> 00:10:36,082
I have to say it, right?

131
00:10:37,453 --> 00:10:38,956
Jen submitted a resignation letter this morning.

132
00:10:38,956 --> 00:10:39,677
What?

133
00:10:39,677 --> 00:10:41,760
He said he would go back to help his family out in Phetchabun.

134
00:10:43,925 --> 00:10:44,599
Right.

135
00:10:47,685 --> 00:10:49,464
And please tell Jarb one last thing for me,

136
00:10:49,464 --> 00:10:51,627
that he's such a coward!

137
00:10:52,456 --> 00:10:54,622
He said we could go back to become friends,

138
00:10:54,622 --> 00:10:58,035
but he just turned out to have Not to transfer me like that!

139
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,152
Is that all he can do? How ridiculous!

140
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,845
Hey!

141
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:09,866
Is he mad at you or me exactly?

142
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,230
Do you even have to ask?

143
00:11:12,993 --> 00:11:14,054
Yeah, it's you.

144
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:16,736
Hey, what are you waiting for?
Go make up with him.

145
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,987
Ok. Come on, Put.

146
00:11:51,118 --> 00:11:55,106
As a boss and a subordinate, you and Pat seem...

147
00:11:56,514 --> 00:11:57,244
quite intimate with each other, don't you?

148
00:12:00,001 --> 00:12:01,394
What do you mean?

149
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,709
I don't know what you're talking about.

150
00:12:09,614 --> 00:12:11,724
Don't you just stop pretending to be clueless, Mr. Jeng.

151
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,071
I believe you know,

152
00:12:16,634 --> 00:12:17,971
that Pat is seeing me.

153
00:12:21,764 --> 00:12:23,322
And that he breaks up with you now.

154
00:12:29,497 --> 00:12:31,221
But he can never forget me,

155
00:12:33,015 --> 00:12:34,187
because I'm his first love.

156
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:40,009
But some say that the first love,

157
00:12:40,397 --> 00:12:44,661
is like the mistake one will never repeat in the next love, isn't it?

158
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,204
But I don't think his next love.

159
00:12:51,214 --> 00:12:52,761
will be his own boss, right?

160
00:12:58,439 --> 00:12:59,114
Ah!

161
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:02,341
And I'm quite sure that Pat never thinks of you,

162
00:13:03,002 --> 00:13:04,671
as someone more than a boss.

163
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,726
I'm warning you with good intention, Mr. Jeng.

164
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,428
A famous person like you might not be able
to come out a lot, right?

165
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:32,084
Mr. Jeng.

166
00:13:32,084 --> 00:13:33,718
The meeting is in the next 15 minutes.

167
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:37,289
I see, Toh.

168
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,811
Yes.

169
00:14:08,567 --> 00:14:09,352
Beam.

170
00:14:09,352 --> 00:14:10,097
What?

171
00:14:10,956 --> 00:14:12,459
I think they're gossiping about me.

172
00:14:13,203 --> 00:14:13,822
Over there.

173
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:16,037
That couple.

174
00:14:16,037 --> 00:14:16,630
Umm...

175
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:19,097
They're been glancing at me for a while.

176
00:14:19,474 --> 00:14:20,535
Isn't it because you're pretty?

177
00:14:20,535 --> 00:14:21,287
Absolutely.

178
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,110
Hey.

179
00:14:28,897 --> 00:14:30,221
This is the father.

180
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:31,073
And this is my husband.

181
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:32,907
Hey!

182
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:37,125
Not your husband, ok?
I'd rather be the father.

183
00:14:37,778 --> 00:14:40,441
I want my baby to look like Pat, not you!

184
00:14:40,441 --> 00:14:40,977
Why not?

185
00:14:41,483 --> 00:14:42,710
What's wrong with my face?

186
00:14:43,346 --> 00:14:47,168
I want my baby to have a cute-looking face like this,

187
00:14:47,168 --> 00:14:49,951
not dark and handsome like yours!

188
00:14:50,872 --> 00:14:51,491
Really?

189
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:52,104
Yeah!

190
00:14:52,104 --> 00:14:52,959
Right, Pat?

191
00:14:55,025 --> 00:14:56,031
Pat!

192
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:56,694
What?

193
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:58,584
Why are you lost like that?

194
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,001
Ae, I think,

195
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,842
we should send him to a doctor as well.

196
00:15:04,282 --> 00:15:05,785
He's really messed up right here.

197
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:10,000
Look at his face.
He's having a hard time with Put for sure.

198
00:15:15,135 --> 00:15:16,472
We've stopped talking now.

199
00:15:16,977 --> 00:15:17,477
What?

200
00:15:17,739 --> 00:15:19,739
Hold on, Pat.

201
00:15:20,361 --> 00:15:21,588
How many times has it been?

202
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,876
I thought he would be serious this time.

203
00:15:23,876 --> 00:15:26,565
Now he's hurt my little brother twice.

204
00:15:26,565 --> 00:15:27,558
Oh my gosh!

205
00:15:27,558 --> 00:15:30,001
I'm done with the work deal with him.
I'm gonna cancel it now.

206
00:15:30,001 --> 00:15:30,501
Hey!

207
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:31,400
I'm making a phone call right now.

208
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,718
Calm down, my friend.

209
00:15:33,525 --> 00:15:35,194
You're pregnant. Calm down.

210
00:15:35,194 --> 00:15:35,921
He's hurt my little brother!

211
00:15:35,921 --> 00:15:36,421
I know.

212
00:15:36,421 --> 00:15:37,878
I was the one who broke up with him.

213
00:15:42,678 --> 00:15:46,058
I don't know. I just didn't feel right.

214
00:15:46,551 --> 00:15:50,429
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's better than resisting it, I think.

215
00:15:50,858 --> 00:15:54,736
I don't know. After this checkup,
I'm gonna treat you to some drinks.

216
00:15:55,443 --> 00:15:57,001
It's good that you're with us now.

217
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:58,274
Hey! Hey! Hey!

218
00:15:58,274 --> 00:15:58,774
What?

219
00:15:58,774 --> 00:15:59,387
Alcohol?

220
00:15:59,387 --> 00:16:03,360
I know! I won't drink! I'm gonna treat him!

221
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,607
Or he'll get sad and alone again, right?

222
00:16:08,187 --> 00:16:11,457
But I don't think you should.
Look at him.

223
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:14,900
You'd better let him go home and think over it alone.

224
00:16:15,652 --> 00:16:18,094
That's true. Now I want to be alone.

225
00:16:18,717 --> 00:16:22,042
I've just canceled an appointment with Mr. Jeng as well.

226
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,033
What kind of appointment is that?

227
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:24,812
Right?

228
00:16:24,812 --> 00:16:28,934
You canceled a work appointment with your boss
just because you're heartbroken?

229
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:30,501
Wow! Gorgeous!

230
00:16:30,501 --> 00:16:32,029
It's not a work appointment.

231
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,786
But it's some task outside my job.

232
00:16:34,788 --> 00:16:38,555
He invited me to some restaurants
to help him come up with some ideas to develop his place.

233
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:41,212
What an appointment!

234
00:16:41,212 --> 00:16:41,915
Eh?

235
00:16:42,685 --> 00:16:44,685
That's how I'll have time to think over it, right?

236
00:16:45,842 --> 00:16:46,342
And he was the one who invited you, wasn't be?

237
00:16:46,342 --> 00:16:49,115
Ahhhh! Look suspicious.

238
00:16:54,702 --> 00:16:56,197
The best of the world!

239
00:16:56,943 --> 00:16:57,783
Ok.

240
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:05,763
Did I make it right, actually?

241
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:10,331
I don't know. But where on earth is the doctor right now?

242
00:17:10,331 --> 00:17:11,649
We've been waiting for so long!

243
00:17:11,649 --> 00:17:12,337
Exactly!

244
00:17:13,194 --> 00:17:14,200
Are you hungry?

245
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,883
Yeah.

246
00:17:15,336 --> 00:17:16,839
Somtam with fermented fish.

247
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,056
Spicy one.

248
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:06,370
You pay for the bill, ok?

249
00:18:08,312 --> 00:18:09,705
How stingy!

250
00:18:10,508 --> 00:18:12,508
I cooked in the hot kitchen all day long.

251
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:14,735
Can't you really treat me?

252
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:31,117
By the way,

253
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:34,212
you're always together with me like this.

254
00:18:34,872 --> 00:18:36,795
Aren't you afraid that others will mistake us

255
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,641
for a gay couple?

256
00:18:41,447 --> 00:18:42,619
I should already get used to it, shouldn't I?

257
00:18:44,398 --> 00:18:46,398
Or do you feel something for me?

258
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:47,573
Huh?

259
00:18:48,818 --> 00:18:52,254
Just find a partner then, or your fans will attack me.

260
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,429
What are you afraid of? Just fight them back.

261
00:19:02,021 --> 00:19:03,082
What the heck is that?

262
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:08,937
With your status, you can literally pick anyone.

263
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:16,089
But this time is different, Tae.

264
00:19:17,568 --> 00:19:20,286
Sometimes I feel like I can hope, but...

265
00:19:20,773 --> 00:19:22,773
it seems too far to reach at the same time.

266
00:19:23,394 --> 00:19:25,670
Well, I thought I could see the light, but...

267
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:28,046
his eyes, Tae.

268
00:19:28,589 --> 00:19:31,031
He never looks at me the way I look at him.

269
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:38,047
So why don't you just let him know that you like him?

270
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:44,509
But it's already been so good that we're like this.

271
00:19:44,838 --> 00:19:46,396
I'm afraid that everything will never be the same.

272
00:19:48,398 --> 00:19:51,779
Really? Is it really good that you're upset like this?

273
00:20:13,062 --> 00:20:15,338
Or is it about time I cut him off and moved on?

274
00:20:19,691 --> 00:20:21,912
I think this is the last time I allow myself to be like this.

275
00:20:22,243 --> 00:20:23,298
Then I'll stop it all for good.

276
00:20:46,391 --> 00:20:51,649
(PAT : Mr. Jeng, if I change my mind, can we still meet up?)

277
00:20:52,412 --> 00:20:52,976
Why are you smiling?

278
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:56,778
Do you think I should just tell him how I feel?

279
00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:03,525
What is wrong with you?

280
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:08,773
You were so gutted lately, and now you're saying...

281
00:21:09,646 --> 00:21:12,198
If he didn't like me,
he wouldn't have accepted my invitation, wouldn't he?

282
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:14,424
But he wants to go with me,

283
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:17,904
so doesn't it mean that he has the same feeling?

284
00:21:18,557 --> 00:21:21,717
Who's the one exactly?
Let me see.

285
00:21:22,258 --> 00:21:25,639
Whoa! You're hiding it from me. What a secretive man!

286
00:21:26,016 --> 00:21:26,746
Huh?

287
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:35,715
It isn't because he thinks this is a job
or that you're his boss, right?

288
00:21:38,229 --> 00:21:39,235
Yeah.

289
00:21:40,826 --> 00:21:41,777
That's true.

290
00:21:43,589 --> 00:21:44,319
It's Pat, right?

291
00:21:48,044 --> 00:21:49,492
When did you know that?

292
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,624
You are his boss, and he's your subordinate.

293
00:21:56,111 --> 00:22:01,811
If anything happens,
I don't think you'll be able to see each other for good.

294
00:22:05,065 --> 00:22:07,838
Oh my gosh! You're so messed up now.

295
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,927
What's with the upset look again?

296
00:22:10,927 --> 00:22:12,700
You always let me down, don't you?

297
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,078
I'm sorry, then.

298
00:22:14,413 --> 00:22:16,247
But what I'm gonna tell you is that,

299
00:22:16,942 --> 00:22:20,267
I want you to follow your own heart.

300
00:22:20,783 --> 00:22:23,832
Go by feelings and do what you want to do.

301
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,658
Thanks a lot, friend.

302
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,478
(PAT : I have selected a dozen of restaurants,
so please check them out.)

303
00:22:53,601 --> 00:22:57,479
Now I'm joining the table with a hopeless romantic, right?

304
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:00,947
Come on, cheers!

305
00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:03,483
Cheers!

306
00:25:08,863 --> 00:25:12,575
(PAT : Where r u? I just arrived)

307
00:25:12,575 --> 00:25:15,534
(Kittipong A : I'm Inside)

308
00:25:19,507 --> 00:25:20,955
You're so early.

309
00:25:35,571 --> 00:25:36,798
Mr. Jeng.

310
00:25:37,956 --> 00:25:38,962
Mr. Jeng.

311
00:25:39,758 --> 00:25:40,322
Yes.

312
00:25:41,497 --> 00:25:42,393
Hello.

313
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,289
You're so early.

314
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:49,427
Well, I didn't want to lose the way, so I made it earlier.

315
00:25:50,001 --> 00:25:51,062
That's good, then.

316
00:25:51,494 --> 00:25:53,384
I thought I would arrived early.

317
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:55,705
Let's have a seat.

318
00:26:13,416 --> 00:26:16,631
(This is not a date. He's just helping me with my work.)

319
00:26:20,886 --> 00:26:22,720
Excuse me. Can we have the menus, please?

320
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:28,102
You can make an order, Pat.

321
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,840
Won't you have anything?

322
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:39,537
Oh! Well, can I have a sangria and calamari with tartar sauce
as an appetizer?

323
00:26:39,537 --> 00:26:44,721
And the main course, can I have mozzarella pizza with ham
and mushroom toppings?

324
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,000
You can order something else, Pat.

325
00:26:47,748 --> 00:26:50,320
Are you gonna eat them all up on you own?

326
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,841
Well, these are for us actually.

327
00:26:54,121 --> 00:26:56,400
But you can order more.

328
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,423
Well, I think that's it here first.

329
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,519
We've got some other places to go.

330
00:27:03,092 --> 00:27:03,822
Ok.

331
00:27:19,027 --> 00:27:20,360
You've something on your mouth.

332
00:27:23,494 --> 00:27:25,339
Really?

333
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:26,805
Yeah.

334
00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:43,382
(Hey! Isn't it too much like a couple?)

335
00:27:44,891 --> 00:27:45,680
Here you go.

336
00:27:46,341 --> 00:27:47,678
Thanks.

337
00:27:54,057 --> 00:27:55,600
It's like we're on a date or something, isn't it?

338
00:28:00,259 --> 00:28:03,032
Look. There's nobody else in here.

339
00:28:04,696 --> 00:28:05,426
Yeah.

340
00:28:08,073 --> 00:28:10,073
How is the table? Are you ok with this?

341
00:28:10,516 --> 00:28:11,688
Well...

342
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,834
Can I choose this one?

343
00:28:14,834 --> 00:28:15,334
All right, sir.

344
00:28:15,845 --> 00:28:21,545
Well, can I have some flowers on this side and that side?

345
00:28:21,545 --> 00:28:22,045
Ok, sir.

346
00:28:22,045 --> 00:28:24,108
And if you have a vase,
could you put it on the middle of the table?

347
00:28:24,108 --> 00:28:24,628
Yes, sir.

348
00:28:24,628 --> 00:28:29,892
And could you please put all the cutlery
on these two tables away?

349
00:28:29,892 --> 00:28:32,521
Can I actually have all the tables in this zone?

350
00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:37,820
Where should the vase go, sir?

351
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,740
Well, on the middle, please.

352
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,880
And could you put all the chairs away from here?

353
00:28:52,378 --> 00:28:54,047
Can I have the menu, please?

354
00:28:54,047 --> 00:28:54,561
Yes, sir.

355
00:28:54,561 --> 00:28:55,290
Thanks.

356
00:28:58,277 --> 00:29:03,204
Can I have a sangria and calamari
with tartar sauce as an appetizer?

357
00:29:03,204 --> 00:29:07,496
And the main course,
can I have mozzarella pizza with ham and mushroom toppings?

358
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:08,140
Yes, sir.

359
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,451
Thank you so much.

360
00:29:24,328 --> 00:29:27,440
Ah! Should we invite Chot to join us here as well?

361
00:29:28,687 --> 00:29:30,000
I don't think so.

362
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,499
It's too urgent, so it might be hard for him.

363
00:29:36,657 --> 00:29:40,000
Today we're just doing some extra survey,
so it's shouldn't be that serious.

364
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,944
I don't think we need someone else here.

365
00:29:45,182 --> 00:29:48,673
Well, I don't want people to say that...

366
00:29:48,673 --> 00:29:51,652
it's unfair that I give you some extra treat,

367
00:29:51,652 --> 00:29:55,644
or I'll be criticized for having my subordinate do my outside job.

368
00:30:00,578 --> 00:30:01,971
But it's true, isn't it?

369
00:30:04,705 --> 00:30:06,705
I really want to help you out myself.

370
00:30:10,585 --> 00:30:11,481
Ok.

371
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,803
I'll keep it between us.

372
00:30:22,641 --> 00:30:26,520
By the way, how about the Forge project?

373
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,280
Let's not talk about our office job, shall we?

374
00:30:35,806 --> 00:30:36,646
I'm sorry.

375
00:30:37,789 --> 00:30:39,789
Today is our restaurant survey, right?

376
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,415
So I'd better have you review this place, Mr. Jeng.

377
00:30:49,322 --> 00:30:50,328
There you go.

378
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,554
Well, let's start with the atmosphere.

379
00:30:53,554 --> 00:30:54,793
What should I say?

380
00:30:55,763 --> 00:30:57,873
Ummm... The real French vibe?

381
00:30:59,244 --> 00:31:02,320
And the food decoration, I'll give it a 5.

382
00:31:03,014 --> 00:31:06,339
The tastes, a 4.

383
00:31:06,339 --> 00:31:11,930
But I'll give this dish a 5, for I smelled a little bit of basil stuff.

384
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:13,886
It was some unusual texture.

385
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,280
I'm being serious.

386
00:31:24,189 --> 00:31:25,195
I'm sorry.

387
00:31:26,846 --> 00:31:29,520
I forgot I was talking to a head chef.

388
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,120
These are good details.

389
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,493
Now it's my turn to ask you some questions.

390
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:39,364
Why did you put this restaurant into the list?

391
00:31:39,836 --> 00:31:42,885
Well, it was simply based on the concept of the survey.

392
00:31:43,351 --> 00:31:46,290
Approachable experience.

393
00:31:46,774 --> 00:31:48,277
Authentic style.

394
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:52,200
I think its style quite matches Pearl & Oliver.

395
00:31:58,835 --> 00:32:00,835
But I don't think you realize,

396
00:32:02,094 --> 00:32:04,701
that you always act formal with me.

397
00:32:07,287 --> 00:32:09,880
Well, you're my boss.

398
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:14,811
So, based on the concept you suggested yourself,

399
00:32:14,811 --> 00:32:18,241
I want you to be yourself today.

400
00:32:18,241 --> 00:32:22,081
Don't see me as your boss,
but your friend you're hanging out with one fine day.

401
00:32:23,456 --> 00:32:24,407
Ok?

402
00:32:27,802 --> 00:32:29,415
Ummm...

403
00:32:30,001 --> 00:32:34,200
Just talk to me like you did when you didn't know
I was meant to be your boss.

404
00:32:38,028 --> 00:32:40,028
Had I known that, I wouldn't have made a fuss like that, would I?

405
00:32:41,505 --> 00:32:42,360
Excuse me?

406
00:32:42,744 --> 00:32:44,137
Huh? Excuse me?

407
00:32:44,866 --> 00:32:45,817
It's nothing.

408
00:33:03,942 --> 00:33:05,114
Hello, Chot.

409
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,545
(Pat.)

410
00:33:08,758 --> 00:33:10,592
(You're at the restaurant, right?)

411
00:33:11,974 --> 00:33:16,293
(Well, I kinda saw that place in your presentation slide
the other day, and it was so interesting.)

412
00:33:16,725 --> 00:33:19,774
So I'm gonna have a meal there today.
What a coincidence!

413
00:33:21,358 --> 00:33:24,297
You don't have to come. I
'm about to leave.

414
00:33:24,939 --> 00:33:26,939
(What? Why are you so hurry?)

415
00:33:26,939 --> 00:33:29,543
(Wait and see me first. I'm at the front now.)

416
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:32,284
Really?

417
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:40,374
We're busted, Mr. Jeng! Chot is coming!

418
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,680
How did he know that?

419
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:46,208
He must've seen my story on Instagram.

420
00:33:48,371 --> 00:33:52,028
Mr. Jeng, if we still want to keep it a secret,
we should leave from the back of the restaurant.

421
00:33:52,652 --> 00:33:53,152
Ok.
Let's go.

422
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,917
Hey, Pat!

423
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:05,680
Hey! You're so quick, sis. Who are you with?

424
00:34:05,887 --> 00:34:09,360
It's nice we meet each other. Can I join your table?

425
00:34:10,598 --> 00:34:14,641
How bad! I'm leaving now.

426
00:34:18,001 --> 00:34:19,394
Come on.

427
00:34:20,598 --> 00:34:23,205
You must be with a guy for sure.

428
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:28,360
Never mind.
I'm really starving here.

429
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,040
No. I'm with my friend.

430
00:34:31,516 --> 00:34:32,080
Hello?

431
00:34:33,107 --> 00:34:34,720
Don't lie to me, kiddo.

432
00:34:36,832 --> 00:34:41,538
You know that I'm not a big mouth.

433
00:34:44,954 --> 00:34:46,678
Well... So excuse me.

434
00:34:46,678 --> 00:34:48,352
My friend is waiting.

435
00:34:50,773 --> 00:34:51,834
Where're you going?

436
00:34:52,763 --> 00:34:53,920
The door is right here, isn't it?

437
00:34:55,848 --> 00:34:59,505
Oh! Yeah! So excuse me. The door is right here.

438
00:34:59,505 --> 00:35:00,005
Yeah.

439
00:35:00,005 --> 00:35:01,391
See ya, sis.

440
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,463
See ya.

441
00:35:05,707 --> 00:35:06,768
The other side!

442
00:35:07,011 --> 00:35:08,790
Oh! Thanks!

443
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:09,619
See you later.

444
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:10,588
Bye.

445
00:35:31,601 --> 00:35:32,552
Has Chot been gone?

446
00:35:32,552 --> 00:35:33,711
I hope so.

447
00:35:35,385 --> 00:35:37,219
We're making it like kids, aren't we?

448
00:35:37,682 --> 00:35:39,682
Running away from people like we did from Chot.

449
00:35:41,023 --> 00:35:41,698
Pat!

450
00:35:43,356 --> 00:35:44,920
Stop you there, you rascal!

451
00:35:46,241 --> 00:35:48,241
You go first, Mr. Jeng! I'm gonna buy you some time!

452
00:35:49,518 --> 00:35:50,524
Let's go together now, Pat!

453
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,040
Wow! That's your man,right?

454
00:35:56,257 --> 00:35:57,318
How tall he is!

455
00:35:57,584 --> 00:35:58,800
Wait!

456
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:02,760
Ouch! Pat! Wait for me!

457
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,134
Urgh! I'm old now! Why are you having me run like this?

458
00:36:06,746 --> 00:36:07,807
Sorry. Are you all right?

459
00:36:07,807 --> 00:36:08,427
I'm sorry.

460
00:36:08,427 --> 00:36:09,425
Are you all right?

461
00:36:09,425 --> 00:36:11,350
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm fine. I'm fine.

462
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:12,955
I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry.

463
00:36:13,867 --> 00:36:14,720
Urgh!

464
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,923
Pat! Pat!

465
00:36:36,645 --> 00:36:37,920
I'm calling a taxi.

466
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,646
Ok.

467
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:06,992
Would you like some drink?

468
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,473
This is sugar-free. You can drink it for sure.

469
00:37:12,617 --> 00:37:13,292
Thanks.

470
00:37:15,991 --> 00:37:17,080
You remember it.

471
00:37:33,399 --> 00:37:34,400
How was it?

472
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:35,911
Do you like it?

473
00:37:37,585 --> 00:37:38,536
Yes, I do.

474
00:37:42,105 --> 00:37:47,360
Well, I like that you're kind and caring like this.

475
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:02,664
Here it comes.

476
00:38:08,104 --> 00:38:09,220
You get in first.

477
00:38:12,548 --> 00:38:13,554
Go over there, bro.

478
00:39:19,616 --> 00:39:21,782
Hi, mate. Let's grab some beers.

479
00:39:22,268 --> 00:39:24,434
(Sorry. I'm taking care of my wife.)

480
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,420
So can I come over?

481
00:39:26,662 --> 00:39:27,695
(What for?)

482
00:39:28,267 --> 00:39:29,660
(You wanna watch us flirting?)

483
00:39:31,488 --> 00:39:32,991
Flirting?

484
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:35,139
(My hubby~)

485
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,379
Ewww!

486
00:39:39,244 --> 00:39:41,575
You just dump your friend when your wife is pregnant, man!

487
00:40:07,203 --> 00:40:08,319
What's up, Jarb?

488
00:40:08,696 --> 00:40:12,297
(Hi, bro. I wanna grab some drinks.)

489
00:40:13,226 --> 00:40:15,392
I'm busy today. Can we make it another day?

490
00:40:19,247 --> 00:40:20,971
He'll be sulking over you for sure.

491
00:40:22,161 --> 00:40:23,920
Just leave the spoiled baby like that.

492
00:40:26,978 --> 00:40:28,880
For this restaurant, you can make an order, Pat.

493
00:40:29,712 --> 00:40:30,640
Ok.

494
00:40:36,422 --> 00:40:38,600
Can we have the lovers' promotion, please?

495
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,275
Yes, sir.

496
00:40:45,278 --> 00:40:47,278
Today you've choked quite a lot.

497
00:40:47,741 --> 00:40:48,913
Some more tissue?

498
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:49,676
No, thanks.

499
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:51,836
Is it all right?

500
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:53,968
Why not?

501
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:58,443
You're collecting some information to come up
with your own promotions, aren't you?

502
00:41:00,798 --> 00:41:02,191
But it's funny, though.

503
00:41:02,979 --> 00:41:05,918
The Valentine's Day hasn't yet to come,
but they have the lovers' promotion here.

504
00:41:07,696 --> 00:41:08,868
Exactly.

505
00:41:12,696 --> 00:41:14,420
Don't you feel uncomfortable, Pat?

506
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:18,360
Do you?

507
00:41:19,548 --> 00:41:21,548
No. I'm fine.

508
00:41:24,829 --> 00:41:26,553
(Hey! I'm such a bad actor!)

509
00:41:27,095 --> 00:41:29,320
Right. Why should I feel uncomfortable, then?

510
00:41:30,419 --> 00:41:31,535
We're not even lovers.

511
00:41:33,523 --> 00:41:34,474
That's true.

512
00:41:35,178 --> 00:41:38,338
(Ouch! That hurts even more!)

513
00:41:44,913 --> 00:41:46,913
Well, I have a game to play with you.

514
00:41:47,532 --> 00:41:48,538
What's that?

515
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:57,280
If I were a menu,

516
00:41:57,784 --> 00:41:59,784
what do you think I would be?

517
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,490
And you also have to describe its signature.

518
00:42:03,723 --> 00:42:05,281
Ummm...

519
00:42:11,222 --> 00:42:12,835
If you were a menu,

520
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:18,960
you'd be lamb carved with a dragon's scales
and served with cheese.

521
00:42:20,407 --> 00:42:23,014
Because you're of Chinese descent
but have some European features.

522
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:24,880
How about me?

523
00:42:27,873 --> 00:42:29,360
A dessert.

524
00:42:29,697 --> 00:42:31,531
A dessert?

525
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,908
A dessert...

526
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,153
Ummm...

527
00:42:40,171 --> 00:42:44,490
If you choose glass jelly, I'll be really mad at you.

528
00:43:04,631 --> 00:43:05,858
Have you ever played this, Mr. Jeng?

529
00:43:06,053 --> 00:43:09,520
Not at all. But I've kinda heard of it.

530
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:13,025
This is the dish throwing activity,

531
00:43:13,025 --> 00:43:15,419
A Greek tradition.

532
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:21,463
They believe that throwing a dish onto the floor
will bring us good luck.

533
00:43:21,826 --> 00:43:24,765
It's like throwing back luck away from our lives.

534
00:43:28,327 --> 00:43:28,827
Thanks.

535
00:43:29,709 --> 00:43:31,543
So let's play, shall we?

536
00:43:31,758 --> 00:43:32,709
Yeah.

537
00:43:32,709 --> 00:43:34,377
Here. Choose a color.

538
00:43:59,665 --> 00:44:00,781
Aren't you gonna write something down?

539
00:44:01,915 --> 00:44:04,880
I'll do it later. Now I don't know what to write.

540
00:44:06,604 --> 00:44:08,604
So you can do it before we leave.

541
00:44:09,646 --> 00:44:10,265
Ok.

542
00:44:11,433 --> 00:44:13,120
Shall we start?

543
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:14,396
Yeah.

544
00:44:23,764 --> 00:44:25,764
I'm really stuffed, Mr. Jeng.

545
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:27,626
How about you?

546
00:44:28,445 --> 00:44:29,617
Me too.

547
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,632
When I'm getting to spend time outside work with you like this,

548
00:44:48,529 --> 00:44:50,529
I'm reminded of the first time we met.

549
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,949
How was I back then?

550
00:44:56,111 --> 00:44:57,660
Ummm...

551
00:44:59,313 --> 00:45:00,595
To be honest,

552
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:07,120
I feel like you were making fooling me or something.

553
00:45:08,244 --> 00:45:11,901
At first, I thought you would scold me for the glass jelly stuff,

554
00:45:12,553 --> 00:45:14,553
but you turned out to be so kind.

555
00:45:17,285 --> 00:45:19,724
It was the very sunny side of you,

556
00:45:20,001 --> 00:45:22,167
making me feel so relieved

557
00:45:22,654 --> 00:45:25,096
that I happened to talk about our department quite a lot.

558
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:29,626
But immediately when you turned out to be my boss,

559
00:45:30,444 --> 00:45:32,444
you seemed just like a different person.

560
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:35,484
You kept some distance between us.

561
00:45:35,814 --> 00:45:36,920
You put some pressure on me.

562
00:45:39,248 --> 00:45:41,400
I really disliked that kind of relationship.

563
00:45:42,895 --> 00:45:47,435
I prefer the time when we were nothing like a boss
and a subordinate.

564
00:45:54,695 --> 00:45:56,143
I'm really impressed, Pat,

565
00:45:56,851 --> 00:45:58,741
that you are frank with me.

566
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:03,724
And this was also how I felt when you were managing
the production team.

567
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,183
I'm also impressed with you, Mr. Jeng,

568
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,222
especially this day.

569
00:46:15,006 --> 00:46:18,221
(Or this is the time to confess my love for him?)

570
00:46:28,937 --> 00:46:31,480
Pat, I've got something to tell you.

571
00:46:35,881 --> 00:46:37,108
Hey!

572
00:46:38,092 --> 00:46:39,153
You're such a cheat!

573
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:43,432
You're still handsome in a candid photo!

574
00:46:46,368 --> 00:46:47,816
That's not true.

575
00:47:09,769 --> 00:47:11,327
Mr. Jeng!

576
00:47:11,861 --> 00:47:12,812
No!

577
00:47:14,441 --> 00:47:15,999
I'm gonna get it back to you!

578
00:47:18,143 --> 00:47:19,094
Gotcha!

579
00:47:21,988 --> 00:47:23,215
No! Mr. Jeng!

580
00:47:23,936 --> 00:47:25,360
Let me see.

581
00:47:27,041 --> 00:47:30,280
Urgh! Delete it now, Mr. Jeng.

582
00:47:30,883 --> 00:47:31,723
No, I won't.

583
00:47:32,321 --> 00:47:33,760
You're kinda cute, I think.

584
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,775
Please turn on your Airdrop,

585
00:47:40,406 --> 00:47:41,684
so I can send you the photos.

586
00:47:42,208 --> 00:47:43,269
Ok.

587
00:47:44,916 --> 00:47:49,567
By the way, have you seen our Forge photos sent by Ban Jay?

588
00:47:50,716 --> 00:47:52,000
I'm gonna send them to you now, ok?

589
00:47:54,915 --> 00:47:56,040
They've been sent.

590
00:47:57,128 --> 00:47:57,913
I've got them.

591
00:48:01,213 --> 00:48:02,329
Have you got mine?

592
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:05,755
Yes, I have.

593
00:48:29,947 --> 00:48:31,229
Are you ok with them?

594
00:48:33,395 --> 00:48:35,800
These are the photos from Ban Jay?

595
00:48:37,012 --> 00:48:37,852
Yes.

596
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:43,904
You have seen them all, right?

597
00:48:45,827 --> 00:48:46,480
Yes, I have.

598
00:48:54,757 --> 00:48:55,929
Are you all right, Pat?

599
00:49:03,289 --> 00:49:04,320
I wanna have a drink.

600
00:49:05,641 --> 00:49:06,702
I think you should be enough.

601
00:49:09,841 --> 00:49:11,620
You've drunk a lot recently.

602
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:27,140
So I may go to the toilet.

603
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:31,230
Pat!

604
00:50:32,185 --> 00:50:34,572
You've been doing it so well all day long.

605
00:50:37,455 --> 00:50:39,565
You just can't mess it up with a few photos, ok?

606
00:51:40,651 --> 00:51:42,209
Do you remember it, Mr. Jeng?

607
00:52:03,915 --> 00:52:05,970
I knew what was going on between you and Put.

608
00:52:12,263 --> 00:52:13,545
I'm worried about you.

609
00:52:14,695 --> 00:52:16,695
I don't want you to bottle it up on your own.

610
00:52:17,115 --> 00:52:20,606
If you have something on your mind, you can always tell me.

611
00:52:28,272 --> 00:52:31,320
But today I might've hoped too much. I'm sorry.

612
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,974
I feel like I'm really selfish.

613
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:40,560
I asked you out without having realized
you were sad and not ready to go out.

614
00:52:43,686 --> 00:52:45,686
I just want you to know,

615
00:52:47,332 --> 00:52:48,840
that I really like you.

616
00:52:50,371 --> 00:52:53,960
So can you give me a chance to take care of you?

617
00:53:06,629 --> 00:53:07,856
Mr. Jeng!

618
00:53:09,626 --> 00:53:10,632
Mr. Jeng!

619
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:12,235
Mr. Jeng!

620
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,724
I've got something to confess, Pat.

621
00:53:40,439 --> 00:53:41,960
What's it about?

622
00:53:50,271 --> 00:53:51,332
Finish this first.

623
00:53:51,672 --> 00:53:55,218
Or they'll see that
I bought the drinks from outside here.

624
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:56,840
Ok.

625
00:54:08,799 --> 00:54:10,799
Have you thrown the dish, Mr. Jeng?

626
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:13,740
Yes, I have.

627
00:54:14,248 --> 00:54:15,696
The waiter has swept it away.

628
00:54:16,293 --> 00:54:17,906
I'm sorry that I didn't wait for you.

629
00:54:18,913 --> 00:54:20,000
That's fine.

630
00:54:20,793 --> 00:54:21,854
I've written something down on it.

631
00:54:30,264 --> 00:54:33,320
I'm just checking that you didn't write my name down there.

632
00:54:35,112 --> 00:54:36,080
No, I didn't.

633
00:55:20,681 --> 00:55:22,200
Are you all right now, Pat?

634
00:55:34,074 --> 00:55:35,246
Yes, I am.

635
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:23,252
See you at work on Monday, Mr. Jeng.

636
00:56:26,561 --> 00:56:27,401
Ahh...

637
00:56:30,959 --> 00:56:33,235
I can't let you go home with such a feeling.

638
00:56:35,717 --> 00:56:36,944
Mr. Jeng.

639
00:56:43,671 --> 00:56:45,064
Well, actually...

640
00:56:45,716 --> 00:56:48,268
I wanna take you to a secret place.

641
00:56:51,903 --> 00:56:52,854
I'm already tired.

642
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:56,136
I wanna go home.

643
00:56:57,893 --> 00:56:59,000
Can I see you off, then?

644
00:57:04,853 --> 00:57:05,760
No, thanks.

645
00:57:06,236 --> 00:57:07,849
I can't bother you.

646
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,336
But I'm willing to do that.

647
00:57:21,495 --> 00:57:27,909
(What??? Why is Put's profile pic black? T^T)
His IG profile pic is also black, I have a bad feeling about this.
I'm so worried about him.

648
00:57:46,256 --> 00:57:47,538
Mind your head.

649
00:58:13,272 --> 00:58:17,316
Are you trying to kidnap me or something?

650
00:58:18,651 --> 00:58:20,761
No, I'm not. Believe me.

651
00:58:22,077 --> 00:58:26,175
This is the secret bar Jarb and I usually visit together.

652
00:58:27,558 --> 00:58:28,398
Let's give it a try.

653
00:58:40,997 --> 00:58:41,727
You're welcome.

654
00:58:56,481 --> 00:58:57,480
Here we go.

655
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,980
Thanks.

656
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:02,130
They're all right here. So now I want you to try every of these.

657
00:59:02,596 --> 00:59:05,600
All of the cocktails here are delicious, I confirm.

658
00:59:06,353 --> 00:59:10,000
Whoa! They must be very delicious then, because you said so.

659
00:59:10,662 --> 00:59:11,668
Let's try.

660
00:59:21,666 --> 00:59:22,396
How was that?

661
00:59:24,804 --> 00:59:27,080
It's a bit too sweet.

662
00:59:28,782 --> 00:59:31,997
But it has quite a lot of the fruit flavor. Quite good.

663
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:35,367
So let's try this one.

664
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:44,315
How was it?

665
00:59:47,398 --> 00:59:48,280
Urgh!

666
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:50,281
Very sour!

667
00:59:50,281 --> 00:59:51,599
Very bad!

668
00:59:52,262 --> 00:59:53,599
Can I have some water?

669
00:59:59,774 --> 01:00:01,498
I think this one is tasty.

670
01:00:02,661 --> 01:00:05,158
And which is your favorite?

671
01:00:07,412 --> 01:00:10,000
Honestly, this one.

672
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:17,320
Well, it's not that sour, actually.

673
01:00:18,405 --> 01:00:18,905
Yeah.

674
01:00:19,413 --> 01:00:21,965
So I'm gonna try another one.

675
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,667
Ummm... That's good.

676
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,280
Is that true?

677
01:00:34,211 --> 01:00:35,327
Yes, it is.

678
01:00:35,761 --> 01:00:36,822
All right.

679
01:00:37,364 --> 01:00:38,204
Cheers!

680
01:00:40,569 --> 01:00:41,741
I'm gonna take this one.

681
01:00:42,682 --> 01:00:43,301
Ok.

682
01:00:56,453 --> 01:00:58,453
You said it was bad, didn't you?

683
01:00:59,057 --> 01:01:00,560
It's still bad, actually.

684
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:14,850
Let's dance, shall we?

685
01:01:16,071 --> 01:01:17,077
I can't.

686
01:01:18,201 --> 01:01:18,931
Come on.

687
01:01:20,001 --> 01:01:21,559
Let's dance, Mr. Jeng.

688
01:01:21,559 --> 01:01:22,528
It'll be good, right?

689
01:01:22,528 --> 01:01:25,079
I'm gonna teach you. Let's go.

690
01:01:25,502 --> 01:01:26,121
Hurry up!

691
01:01:26,866 --> 01:01:28,479
Mr. Jeng!

692
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,434
I'm not really good at it.

693
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:44,040
Mr. Jeng!

694
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:47,826
Come on! Get up! Let's have fun. Do it like this.

695
01:01:49,427 --> 01:01:50,886
Do it like this.

696
01:01:52,782 --> 01:01:54,360
Up, up, up!

697
01:01:55,988 --> 01:01:57,000
Turn around!

698
01:02:03,339 --> 01:02:05,200
Let's have fun, Mr. Jeng!

699
01:02:47,956 --> 01:02:49,724
On the Rocks, bro.

700
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:52,809
Make it strong, ok?

701
01:03:21,759 --> 01:03:22,931
Great!

702
01:03:31,017 --> 01:03:32,851
They're all in pairs.

703
01:03:38,162 --> 01:03:39,058
Bro!

704
01:03:40,001 --> 01:03:41,338
Two more glasses of On the Rocks.

705
01:03:41,338 --> 01:03:42,454
Make them as strong as before.

706
01:04:07,044 --> 01:04:10,480
You're so mean, Jen.
How could you dump me like that?

707
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:24,343
Good job, guys!

708
01:04:25,773 --> 01:04:26,889
Excellent!

709
01:05:24,601 --> 01:05:25,994
Didn't you answer my phone?

710
01:05:27,373 --> 01:05:28,766
You rascal, Jarb!

711
01:05:46,866 --> 01:05:48,866
I'm a bit drunk now.

712
01:05:55,691 --> 01:05:56,697
Do you know something, Mr. Jeng?

713
01:05:59,725 --> 01:06:00,897
Actually,

714
01:06:01,521 --> 01:06:05,564
I really wished that you wouldn't have chosen
the second restaurant.

715
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,440
Why?

716
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,120
To be honest,

717
01:06:17,311 --> 01:06:22,000
I used to go there with my ex two years ago.

718
01:06:23,649 --> 01:06:25,483
When we reconciled,

719
01:06:26,819 --> 01:06:30,310
we promised that we would go there again.

720
01:06:33,259 --> 01:06:35,756
That's why I put it in the list,

721
01:06:36,327 --> 01:06:39,100
thinking that it might match your restaurant quite well.

722
01:06:41,741 --> 01:06:43,741
But I never thought you would really choose it.

723
01:06:47,473 --> 01:06:49,473
And when I really was to be there,

724
01:06:53,733 --> 01:06:56,009
I couldn't help thinking of him.

725
01:07:04,227 --> 01:07:05,343
I'm so sorry.

726
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Why?

727
01:07:12,562 --> 01:07:14,562
It's not your fault.

728
01:07:16,059 --> 01:07:17,728
You didn't know that.

729
01:07:18,932 --> 01:07:21,600
You've said sorry to me too many times today.

730
01:07:32,243 --> 01:07:34,022
I always thought,

731
01:07:36,687 --> 01:07:39,294
that the one who was dumped should be hurt more.

732
01:07:48,838 --> 01:07:50,838
But today I have realized,

733
01:07:59,647 --> 01:08:02,600
that the other one can be hurt as well.

734
01:08:14,081 --> 01:08:16,081
Thank you so much, Mr. Jeng,

735
01:08:17,641 --> 01:08:19,531
for inviting me out today.

736
01:08:23,828 --> 01:08:25,441
If I were alone,

737
01:08:27,361 --> 01:08:29,361
I would be thinking too much about it again.

738
01:08:33,569 --> 01:08:35,640
I feel so good.

739
01:08:38,041 --> 01:08:39,240
If possible,

740
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:43,524
I want to do something for you in return.

741
01:08:54,718 --> 01:08:56,718
In the past many days,

742
01:08:58,521 --> 01:09:00,000
I've actually been thinking so much about you,

743
01:09:02,618 --> 01:09:07,434
looking forward to the chance to confess my feelings
and ask you to be my boyfriend.

744
01:09:10,572 --> 01:09:12,280
But I didn't know at all,

745
01:09:13,281 --> 01:09:15,005
that you were trying to act strong.

746
01:09:21,127 --> 01:09:25,160
Now it doesn't matter that I will be your boyfriend.

747
01:09:28,007 --> 01:09:31,498
At least, please let me be your safe zone

748
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:34,426
and take care of you.

749
01:09:37,012 --> 01:09:39,012
This is all you can do for me in return.

750
01:09:46,125 --> 01:09:47,904
And I will never do anything more than this.

751
01:09:48,921 --> 01:09:50,258
I promise.

752
01:10:03,383 --> 01:10:04,113
Pat!

753
01:10:04,113 --> 01:10:05,104
Toilet!

754
01:10:05,381 --> 01:10:06,939
I need to go to the toilet!

755
01:10:06,939 --> 01:10:08,427
Let me go with you.

756
01:10:11,552 --> 01:10:12,945
Are you all right?

757
01:10:13,656 --> 01:10:15,104
Sit down first, won't you?

758
01:10:17,137 --> 01:10:17,977
That's fine.

759
01:10:18,666 --> 01:10:20,666
Don't follow me. I'm gonna puke.

760
01:10:22,641 --> 01:10:23,371
Pat!

761
01:10:23,668 --> 01:10:24,729
Don't follow me!

762
01:10:28,419 --> 01:10:30,000
I'm waiting here, ok?

763
01:10:40,633 --> 01:10:41,197
Hey!

764
01:10:41,197 --> 01:10:41,981
Hey!

765
01:10:41,981 --> 01:10:42,802
Jeng!

766
01:10:43,481 --> 01:10:44,818
Hey, Allon.

767
01:10:44,818 --> 01:10:46,668
Yeah, it's me.

768
01:10:47,187 --> 01:10:48,856
Oh wow!

769
01:10:49,729 --> 01:10:51,508
It didn't expect to see you here.

770
01:10:51,885 --> 01:10:53,609
Didn't expect to see you here, I know.

771
01:10:55,507 --> 01:10:56,789
What are you doing here?

772
01:10:56,789 --> 01:10:59,753
I'm just hanging out with my friends.

773
01:11:00,279 --> 01:11:00,843
Ok.

774
01:11:03,276 --> 01:11:04,613
Yeah long time ha.

775
01:11:04,613 --> 01:11:05,347
Yeah!

776
01:11:21,292 --> 01:11:24,728
Urgh! What a headache!

777
01:11:27,505 --> 01:11:30,775
Bruh! Why do I get drunk faster by age?

778
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:37,956
You always force me to grow up and mature.

779
01:11:38,933 --> 01:11:42,811
You always say that I'm crazy and act like a child.

780
01:11:43,684 --> 01:11:47,727
You just act like a mother, Jen!

781
01:11:48,924 --> 01:11:49,654
Jen?

782
01:11:50,693 --> 01:11:52,693
Why is the name so familiar?

783
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,172
Never mind.

784
01:12:02,198 --> 01:12:03,756
Urgh! I'm not gonna drink anymore!

785
01:12:07,005 --> 01:12:08,232
Hey! Bro!

786
01:12:08,518 --> 01:12:09,745
Are you all right?

787
01:12:12,081 --> 01:12:13,418
Yeah.

788
01:12:15,709 --> 01:12:17,157
I'm still fine.

789
01:12:18,103 --> 01:12:20,000
Thanks, Mr. Stranger!

790
01:12:22,652 --> 01:12:23,713
Don't worry.

791
01:12:27,443 --> 01:12:30,000
Don't allow anyone to play with your feelings, ok?

792
01:12:31,554 --> 01:12:33,554
So you won't be messed up like me.

793
01:12:34,744 --> 01:12:35,584
Yeah.

794
01:12:36,608 --> 01:12:38,080
I see.

795
01:12:59,193 --> 01:13:00,000
Mr. Jeng.

796
01:13:00,641 --> 01:13:03,200
I found a freak in the toilet.

797
01:13:04,785 --> 01:13:06,785
I think I need to leave now.

798
01:13:20,606 --> 01:13:21,612
Are you all right, Pat?

799
01:13:22,762 --> 01:13:23,934
Do you feel better now?

800
01:13:28,286 --> 01:13:29,182
Mr. Jeng,

801
01:13:30,001 --> 01:13:31,835
you have so many friends, don't you?

802
01:13:33,095 --> 01:13:35,261
You always meet your friends here and there.

803
01:13:38,424 --> 01:13:40,755
So that's your friend too, I guess.

804
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:43,629
That too, right?

805
01:13:45,828 --> 01:13:48,480
And this too.

806
01:13:52,398 --> 01:13:54,398
I don't have so many friends as you think.

807
01:13:56,519 --> 01:13:57,470
That guy,

808
01:13:59,669 --> 01:14:00,841
he's my ex.

809
01:14:10,001 --> 01:14:12,277
This joke is so lame, Mr. Jeng.

810
01:14:14,605 --> 01:14:16,120
I'm not joking.

811
01:14:30,910 --> 01:14:31,971
Mr. Jeng,

812
01:14:34,391 --> 01:14:35,618
you like guys.

813
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:01,169
Pat!

814
01:15:11,895 --> 01:15:12,791
Pat!

815
01:15:16,097 --> 01:15:17,840
Wait, Pat!

816
01:15:18,835 --> 01:15:19,565
Pat!

817
01:15:23,034 --> 01:15:23,874
Pat!

818
01:15:26,874 --> 01:15:27,825
Are you all right?

819
01:15:51,361 --> 01:15:52,201
Dad.

820
01:15:52,201 --> 01:15:54,686
You do this every single year, don't you remember?

821
01:15:54,686 --> 01:15:56,383
It's almost your birthday.

822
01:15:56,383 --> 01:15:58,371
The friend who dropped you off last night.

823
01:15:58,371 --> 01:15:59,685
Was that your friend?

824
01:15:59,685 --> 01:16:01,040
The one that's named Jeng.

825
01:16:02,031 --> 01:16:03,092
Have you seen Pat?

826
01:16:03,441 --> 01:16:05,275
He took the day off.

827
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:09,391
You come back this time, but when are you coming back again?

828
01:16:10,001 --> 01:16:11,720
Can I talk to you?

829
01:16:13,377 --> 01:16:14,383
I like you.
