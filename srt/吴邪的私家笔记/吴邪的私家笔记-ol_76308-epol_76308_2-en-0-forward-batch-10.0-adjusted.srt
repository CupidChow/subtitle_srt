=Episode 2=

3
00:02:19,424 --> 00:02:21,162
(I've finally embarked on the journey.)

4
00:02:22,688 --> 00:02:23,643
(In Grandpa's notes,)

5
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,562
(those fascinating stories)

6
00:02:26,144 --> 00:02:27,243
(made me fantasize)

7
00:02:27,243 --> 00:02:28,882
(about this journey.)

8
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,562
(I wonder if I will encounter)

9
00:02:33,376 --> 00:02:35,456
(that many bizarre things
as Grandpa did.)

10
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,762
(But I have a strong premonition)

11
00:02:49,344 --> 00:02:52,523
(that my life
is now beginning a new chapter)

12
00:02:52,928 --> 00:02:54,842
(with this journey.)

13
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,803
(I want to record)

14
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,368
(what I see and feel in this journey)

15
00:03:02,368 --> 00:03:03,683
(like Grandpa did.)

16
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:08,562
(Will it be an interesting story?)

17
00:03:53,363 --> 00:03:54,336
Third Uncle.

18
00:03:56,602 --> 00:03:58,162
Who is that guy?

19
00:03:58,882 --> 00:04:00,442
Why is he acting like a mute?

20
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:01,882
Don't underestimate him.

21
00:04:02,203 --> 00:04:03,523
He's quite agile.

22
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:05,888
Can he really help at this young age?

23
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,923
In this world,

24
00:04:09,152 --> 00:04:10,523
some people like to brag,

25
00:04:10,523 --> 00:04:12,282
some keep a low profile,

26
00:04:13,024 --> 00:04:15,520
and some are clueless
about who they are.

27
00:04:16,128 --> 00:04:17,683
What kind of person are you?

28
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,642
Wait, Third Uncle.

29
00:04:44,544 --> 00:04:46,723
Hi, I'm Wu Xie.

30
00:05:03,392 --> 00:05:04,768
This way, everyone.

31
00:05:04,768 --> 00:05:07,442
Yang, are you a full-time guide here?

32
00:05:07,968 --> 00:05:09,123
People visit here often?

33
00:05:09,472 --> 00:05:10,603
Yes.

34
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,680
Young people nowadays

35
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,202
love exploring mountains.

36
00:05:13,202 --> 00:05:13,683
Is that so?

37
00:05:13,824 --> 00:05:14,336
We're here.

38
00:05:14,336 --> 00:05:15,243
Already?

39
00:05:15,243 --> 00:05:15,840
Yes.

40
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:19,603
This is the final stretch.

41
00:05:19,872 --> 00:05:21,843
No vehicles or roads ahead.

42
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,040
We need to take a boat

43
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,202
to reach the cave you mentioned.

44
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,762
Where's the boat?

45
00:05:30,272 --> 00:05:31,168
Just wait.

46
00:05:32,642 --> 00:05:35,123
Lv Dandan!

47
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:38,803
The boatman's name is Lv Dandan?

48
00:05:38,803 --> 00:05:40,322
What a peculiar name.

49
00:05:41,683 --> 00:05:42,843
Dandan!

50
00:05:48,283 --> 00:05:49,632
Why is there a dog?

51
00:05:49,632 --> 00:05:51,723
Are we supposed to ride the dog?

52
00:05:51,723 --> 00:05:53,202
How could we ride a dog?

53
00:05:53,202 --> 00:05:55,840
The dog is our messenger.

54
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:00,562
What?

55
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,322
Lv Dandan.

56
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,522
The dog told me

57
00:06:09,568 --> 00:06:10,642
it's still early.

58
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,243
The boatman isn't ready yet.

59
00:06:12,442 --> 00:06:13,562
Let's rest for a while.

60
00:06:13,562 --> 00:06:15,243
Amazing!

61
00:06:15,243 --> 00:06:16,800
You understand dog language?

62
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,082
Okay.

63
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,968
I think it's around two o'clock already.

64
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:25,792
That guy is still not ready to work yet?

65
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:27,072
Can he be that slack off?

66
00:06:27,456 --> 00:06:29,803
He's the only boatman here.

67
00:06:29,952 --> 00:06:31,360
He works

68
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,123
whenever he wants to.

69
00:06:33,536 --> 00:06:34,923
Even the village chief

70
00:06:35,232 --> 00:06:37,216
can't do anything about him.

71
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,880
Get someone else then.

72
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,096
Someone more diligent.

73
00:06:40,096 --> 00:06:41,312
We'd love to,

74
00:06:41,696 --> 00:06:43,163
but you outsiders don't know.

75
00:06:43,163 --> 00:06:44,522
The Mountain God

76
00:06:44,522 --> 00:06:46,043
only likes him.

77
00:06:46,043 --> 00:06:48,064
Others go there and never return.

78
00:06:48,064 --> 00:06:49,472
Only he can

79
00:06:49,472 --> 00:06:50,720
go in and out safely.

80
00:06:51,008 --> 00:06:51,936
It's eerie.

81
00:06:52,448 --> 00:06:54,522
How can such a strange thing happen?

82
00:06:55,424 --> 00:06:56,992
Did others who enter the cave

83
00:06:56,992 --> 00:06:57,920
get devoured?

84
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,402
That cave devours people?

85
00:06:59,744 --> 00:07:00,832
Elders in the village

86
00:07:00,832 --> 00:07:02,816
say a snake monster lives inside,

87
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,832
and the boatman's ancestors

88
00:07:04,832 --> 00:07:06,723
once saved the snake monster's life,

89
00:07:06,723 --> 00:07:08,082
so he can enter the cave safely.

90
00:07:08,082 --> 00:07:08,762
A snake monster?

91
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:09,472
Eerie.

92
00:07:09,568 --> 00:07:10,562
A rumor, I guess.

93
00:07:10,592 --> 00:07:12,683
Anyway, young explorers who've entered

94
00:07:13,152 --> 00:07:14,442
never made it back.

95
00:07:17,664 --> 00:07:19,776
The routes in the cave must be complex,

96
00:07:19,776 --> 00:07:21,056
trapping them forever.

97
00:07:21,184 --> 00:07:22,496
Where were

98
00:07:22,496 --> 00:07:24,128
the boatman's ancestors from,

99
00:07:24,128 --> 00:07:25,163
Yang?

100
00:07:25,163 --> 00:07:26,683
I don't know.

101
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,762
That's long, long ago!

102
00:07:29,363 --> 00:07:30,442
I don't know.

103
00:07:30,848 --> 00:07:32,363
Why do you smell so bad?

104
00:07:36,512 --> 00:07:37,760
Haven't you taken a bath?

105
00:07:37,888 --> 00:07:39,562
Didn't you just come out of the river?

106
00:07:43,243 --> 00:07:44,123
Lv Dandan.

107
00:07:44,283 --> 00:07:44,923
Come here.

108
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,082
This dog is off.

109
00:07:46,843 --> 00:07:47,803
Go...

110
00:07:48,123 --> 00:07:49,123
Go fetch the boat.

111
00:07:57,024 --> 00:07:57,632
What?

112
00:07:57,632 --> 00:07:58,522
Third Master.

113
00:07:59,402 --> 00:08:00,683
The dog smells wrong.

114
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,712
Right. It's stinky.

115
00:08:04,096 --> 00:08:05,536
This dog eats bat dung.

116
00:08:07,776 --> 00:08:09,163
The old man is suspicious too.

117
00:08:09,163 --> 00:08:10,642
He's been stalling.

118
00:08:11,264 --> 00:08:13,088
I think he's waiting for something.

119
00:08:14,272 --> 00:08:16,163
Probably waiting for the sun to set.

120
00:08:16,384 --> 00:08:18,656
That boatman eats bat dung too.

121
00:08:18,656 --> 00:08:20,640
Maybe people who eat bat dung

122
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,762
can't handle summer heat,

123
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:26,243
and have to come out at cooler times.

124
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,448
If I'm right,

125
00:08:30,016 --> 00:08:30,816
that is

126
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,512
a wet cave.

127
00:08:47,872 --> 00:08:48,672
Third Uncle.

128
00:08:54,176 --> 00:08:54,976
Third Uncle.

129
00:08:55,776 --> 00:08:57,376
What exactly is a wet cave?

130
00:09:01,952 --> 00:09:03,008
Not sure.

131
00:09:03,603 --> 00:09:05,282
But on a past expedition,

132
00:09:05,443 --> 00:09:07,363
I entered a cave

133
00:09:07,522 --> 00:09:09,042
that was used

134
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,424
by Japanese to bury massacre victims.

135
00:09:12,576 --> 00:09:14,272
It was full of corpses.

136
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:16,323
All we did is

137
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:20,522
to tie poultry and dogs
to the bamboo raft.

138
00:09:21,248 --> 00:09:22,528
Then

139
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:23,882
mount a camera on it.

140
00:09:24,802 --> 00:09:25,792
Slowly

141
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:26,944
send the raft

142
00:09:26,944 --> 00:09:29,152
into the cave.

143
00:09:34,368 --> 00:09:36,608
(We used long cables.)

144
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:39,296
(But when cables ran out,)

145
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,402
(the raft still didn't come out.)

146
00:09:42,592 --> 00:09:44,256
(It drifted away somewhere.)

147
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,264
(We tried pulling it back.)

148
00:09:48,128 --> 00:09:49,312
(But after a few pulls,)

149
00:09:50,912 --> 00:09:52,563
(the raft flipped suddenly.)

150
00:09:55,296 --> 00:09:56,802
(At the end of the video,)

151
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,688
(there occurred half a creepy face)

152
00:09:59,296 --> 00:10:00,736
(on the screen.)

153
00:10:03,488 --> 00:10:04,563
What was

154
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:05,802
that exactly?

155
00:10:07,762 --> 00:10:08,576
Later, I discovered

156
00:10:08,576 --> 00:10:10,203
it was just a monkey.

157
00:10:12,203 --> 00:10:14,203
Know how ancient people handled it?

158
00:10:15,642 --> 00:10:17,762
They'd feed people

159
00:10:17,762 --> 00:10:19,843
bat dung daily

160
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,882
for three to six months.

161
00:10:23,802 --> 00:10:26,002
What's bat dung exactly?

162
00:10:26,963 --> 00:10:28,203
Just as its name implies.

163
00:10:31,603 --> 00:10:33,963
Anyway, eating bat dung

164
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,936
can make people

165
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:38,363
smell like bats.

166
00:10:39,008 --> 00:10:40,384
Then they'd enter.

167
00:10:42,432 --> 00:10:44,282
Even ghosts couldn't tell

168
00:10:44,282 --> 00:10:46,203
if they are human or ghosts.

169
00:10:47,042 --> 00:10:49,152
So, only boatmen

170
00:10:50,002 --> 00:10:51,200
can enter the cave

171
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,843
because they eat bat dung.

172
00:10:53,408 --> 00:10:55,042
He's eaten it,

173
00:10:55,776 --> 00:10:57,216
but we haven't.

174
00:10:58,762 --> 00:11:00,384
It's superstition,

175
00:11:00,896 --> 00:11:03,328
but we still need be cautious.

176
00:11:03,808 --> 00:11:05,952
This cave is probably dangerous.

177
00:11:10,144 --> 00:11:11,162
Scared?

178
00:11:12,448 --> 00:11:13,568
Not really.

179
00:11:13,888 --> 00:11:14,976
No.

180
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:18,642
Admit it if you're scared.

181
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,243
You can stay.

182
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:22,944
I'm fine.

183
00:11:24,992 --> 00:11:26,042
Young Third Master.

184
00:11:33,504 --> 00:11:35,008
Are you dumb?

185
00:11:37,216 --> 00:11:39,843
Eating bat dung is no big deal.

186
00:11:40,064 --> 00:11:41,843
Third Master was fooling you.

187
00:11:43,232 --> 00:11:45,203
Is eating bat dung common?

188
00:11:49,402 --> 00:11:51,443
Let me tell you something.

189
00:11:52,762 --> 00:11:53,723
Do you know

190
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:56,723
there's a prison

191
00:11:57,363 --> 00:11:58,522
in Mobei Manledan?

192
00:11:59,682 --> 00:12:01,282
If the inmates

193
00:12:01,282 --> 00:12:02,882
want to escape,

194
00:12:02,882 --> 00:12:04,522
they have to do so

195
00:12:04,762 --> 00:12:06,363
as three people.

196
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:07,762
Do you know why?

197
00:12:07,762 --> 00:12:08,672
Why?

198
00:12:10,144 --> 00:12:12,762
The prison is built deep

199
00:12:13,682 --> 00:12:15,402
(in a snow mountain.)

200
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,203
Nonsense.

201
00:12:18,882 --> 00:12:20,512
Mobei has no snow mountains!

202
00:12:20,512 --> 00:12:23,200
I can tell you didn't
learn geography well.

203
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,736
Mobei's highest peak

204
00:12:24,736 --> 00:12:27,243
is with an altitude of 5,881 meters.

205
00:12:27,648 --> 00:12:28,320
Right.

206
00:12:28,544 --> 00:12:29,696
Three people escape,

207
00:12:30,752 --> 00:12:31,872
(with no equipment)

208
00:12:32,288 --> 00:12:33,536
(or food.)

209
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,608
If one of them collapses...

210
00:12:36,608 --> 00:12:37,243
Tell me,

211
00:12:37,243 --> 00:12:38,624
what should the other two do?

212
00:12:43,168 --> 00:12:43,872
Eat him.

213
00:12:44,288 --> 00:12:45,408
If they don't, they'll die.

214
00:12:45,843 --> 00:12:46,723
Right?

215
00:12:46,752 --> 00:12:48,162
After it, they can keep going

216
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,443
until another one collapses.

217
00:12:50,522 --> 00:12:51,762
Then the last person eats him.

218
00:12:53,723 --> 00:12:54,682
(In the end,)

219
00:12:54,843 --> 00:12:57,363
only one person can survive.

220
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,040
I wonder how you heard

221
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,642
such a disgusting story.

222
00:13:04,642 --> 00:13:06,203
It's not disgusting at all.

223
00:13:06,483 --> 00:13:08,083
Because I

224
00:13:09,402 --> 00:13:11,402
was the one who survived.

225
00:13:12,802 --> 00:13:14,443
Really?

226
00:13:15,392 --> 00:13:16,483
It's true.

227
00:13:22,304 --> 00:13:23,136
Pan Zi.

228
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,443
How many more times

229
00:13:25,802 --> 00:13:27,203
would you tell this story?

230
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:29,216
You tell the same old story every time.

231
00:13:29,696 --> 00:13:32,256
But your version today
differs a bit from what I heard

232
00:13:32,352 --> 00:13:33,728
before.

233
00:13:34,048 --> 00:13:35,904
I think you have changed.

234
00:13:37,632 --> 00:13:38,240
Third Master.

235
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:39,648
What's different?

236
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:41,522
Have I changed?

237
00:13:42,048 --> 00:13:42,912
Wait.

238
00:14:20,352 --> 00:14:21,312
The boat is here.

239
00:14:21,984 --> 00:14:22,784
Come on.

240
00:14:22,784 --> 00:14:23,744
Time to board the boat.

241
00:14:55,584 --> 00:14:57,376
Remember the rules.

242
00:14:58,048 --> 00:14:58,944
In the cave,

243
00:14:58,944 --> 00:15:00,483
keep your voices low.

244
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:01,536
Don't look into the water

245
00:15:01,888 --> 00:15:04,363
and never speak ill of the Mountain God.

246
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,963
How long will it take to pass through?

247
00:15:08,963 --> 00:15:10,243
Five minutes at best.

248
00:15:10,528 --> 00:15:12,123
The current is flowing fast,

249
00:15:12,123 --> 00:15:13,042
so it goes quickly.

250
00:15:14,048 --> 00:15:15,168
What about at worst?

251
00:15:15,584 --> 00:15:16,922
The water

252
00:15:17,642 --> 00:15:19,200
flows downstream sometimes,

253
00:15:19,563 --> 00:15:21,402
so when we enter,

254
00:15:21,402 --> 00:15:22,802
we are going against the current.

255
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:24,192
That takes longer,

256
00:15:24,512 --> 00:15:25,882
about 15 minutes.

257
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,424
There are many bends inside.

258
00:15:27,424 --> 00:15:28,282
It's dangerous.

259
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:29,856
And it's complete dark inside,

260
00:15:29,856 --> 00:15:31,168
so we won't see a thing.

261
00:15:31,424 --> 00:15:32,843
Stay alert.

262
00:15:33,922 --> 00:15:35,162
But for him,

263
00:15:35,162 --> 00:15:36,443
with over a decade's experience,

264
00:15:36,563 --> 00:15:38,642
he relies on his ears.

265
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,443
Anyway,

266
00:15:41,443 --> 00:15:42,963
follow my rules exactly.

267
00:15:46,176 --> 00:15:48,002
Can we use flashlights?

268
00:15:49,376 --> 00:15:50,688
It's okay.

269
00:15:51,008 --> 00:15:52,576
Never shine them on the water,

270
00:15:52,843 --> 00:15:53,843
or you'll regret it.

271
00:15:53,984 --> 00:15:54,816
Why?

272
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,512
Water ghosts?

273
00:15:57,762 --> 00:15:59,162
That's nothing.

274
00:15:59,162 --> 00:16:01,083
What's in there is unimaginable.

275
00:16:01,203 --> 00:16:02,402
If you're brave enough,

276
00:16:02,402 --> 00:16:03,360
take a look yourself.

277
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,576
I don't know either.

278
00:16:04,576 --> 00:16:05,632
If you're lucky,

279
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,264
you'll just see dark water.

280
00:16:07,264 --> 00:16:08,608
If unlucky,

281
00:16:10,592 --> 00:16:11,963
you'll get scared!

282
00:16:12,363 --> 00:16:13,443
Have you seen them?

283
00:16:13,824 --> 00:16:14,656
Me?

284
00:16:14,976 --> 00:16:16,128
Never.

285
00:16:21,056 --> 00:16:21,792
Third Master.

286
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,288
Can we trust this guy?

287
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:26,592
He's full of spooky tales.

288
00:16:26,976 --> 00:16:28,682
They're all suspicious.

289
00:16:29,216 --> 00:16:30,603
Once we enter,

290
00:16:30,603 --> 00:16:32,203
they might do unexpected things.

291
00:16:32,512 --> 00:16:33,563
Stay alert.

292
00:17:19,803 --> 00:17:21,523
This cave is so narrow.

293
00:17:22,323 --> 00:17:23,323
This is spacious.

294
00:17:23,323 --> 00:17:24,256
There's a stretch ahead

295
00:17:24,288 --> 00:17:25,563
even lower than here.

296
00:17:25,563 --> 00:17:26,592
This is spacious?

297
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:27,843
Yes.

298
00:17:28,032 --> 00:17:28,682
A small cave.

299
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:30,283
If robbers attack here,

300
00:17:30,523 --> 00:17:31,843
we have nowhere to escape.

301
00:18:01,568 --> 00:18:02,496
Third Master.

302
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,608
This cave isn't ordinary.

303
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:09,216
This cave

304
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:11,936
has a history spanning over a century.

305
00:18:13,363 --> 00:18:14,962
Explosives won't work here.

306
00:18:16,224 --> 00:18:18,048
It appears to be man-made.

307
00:18:18,784 --> 00:18:20,323
Man-made?

308
00:18:20,672 --> 00:18:22,816
It would take 100 people
over ten years to carve this.

309
00:18:24,576 --> 00:18:26,882
Why did that just to dig a cave?

310
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:28,960
Yang,

311
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:30,560
where does this path lead?

312
00:18:31,296 --> 00:18:32,576
There's a mountain ahead

313
00:18:32,672 --> 00:18:34,682
where legend says a deity resides.

314
00:18:35,283 --> 00:18:36,763
A path built for a deity.

315
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:38,162
Possibly.

316
00:18:38,363 --> 00:18:40,416
But earlier you mentioned

317
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:41,728
this place has a snake monster?

318
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:44,288
Why didn't the deity
vanquish the snake monster?

319
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,336
I don't know.

320
00:18:46,336 --> 00:18:48,162
These are legends passed down by elders.

321
00:18:48,363 --> 00:18:50,363
I can't say if they are true.

322
00:18:50,803 --> 00:18:51,803
You made that up, right?

323
00:19:12,162 --> 00:19:13,083
Who?

324
00:19:15,682 --> 00:19:16,682
Stop it.

325
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:19,242
Scared?

326
00:19:23,603 --> 00:19:24,922
There are five of us,

327
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,283
and they only have two.

328
00:19:26,922 --> 00:19:28,402
If we start fighting,

329
00:19:28,682 --> 00:19:29,962
we might not lose.

330
00:19:30,843 --> 00:19:32,563
If they actually attack,

331
00:19:33,642 --> 00:19:34,922
they must have some tricks.

332
00:19:40,043 --> 00:19:41,363
You're pretty sharp.

333
00:19:41,523 --> 00:19:42,922
Top student indeed.

334
00:19:46,283 --> 00:19:47,563
What are you two talking about?

335
00:19:51,043 --> 00:19:52,043
Young Third Master

336
00:19:53,202 --> 00:19:54,202
is extraordinary.

337
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,088
He faces such conditions
on the first expedition

338
00:19:57,088 --> 00:19:58,242
without breaking down.

339
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,442
Nice.

340
00:20:00,442 --> 00:20:01,440
Young Third Master.

341
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,882
Do you still remember

342
00:20:02,882 --> 00:20:04,482
your first field work?

343
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:05,600
In my memories,

344
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,912
early when I was in my diapers,

345
00:20:06,912 --> 00:20:08,384
I started working with Third Master.

346
00:20:08,384 --> 00:20:09,248
Cut the crap.

347
00:20:09,248 --> 00:20:10,603
If you started before me,

348
00:20:10,803 --> 00:20:11,882
I'd have been

349
00:20:11,882 --> 00:20:13,043
changing your diapers!

350
00:20:13,043 --> 00:20:14,016
Don't worry.

351
00:20:14,016 --> 00:20:14,962
When you're old,

352
00:20:14,962 --> 00:20:16,283
I'll return your favor.

353
00:20:24,563 --> 00:20:25,323
He means

354
00:20:25,323 --> 00:20:26,368
you should stop talking.

355
00:20:26,368 --> 00:20:27,523
Stop talking.

356
00:20:27,523 --> 00:20:29,083
It will cause trouble.

357
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:30,363
Trouble?

358
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:31,642
What kind of trouble?

359
00:20:31,843 --> 00:20:33,722
I'd like to see what trouble comes.

360
00:20:37,242 --> 00:20:38,083
Listen.

361
00:20:38,642 --> 00:20:39,763
Someone is talking.

362
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:31,682
Where are they?

363
00:21:31,962 --> 00:21:32,882
What?

364
00:21:33,722 --> 00:21:34,682
Where are the two?

365
00:21:34,682 --> 00:21:35,523
What happened?

366
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,384
Pan Zi.

367
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,120
What happened?

368
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,523
I don't know.

369
00:21:38,722 --> 00:21:40,123
I heard no splash.

370
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:41,722
Wait,

371
00:21:41,803 --> 00:21:42,682
did we all zone out

372
00:21:42,682 --> 00:21:43,722
for a moment?

373
00:21:44,123 --> 00:21:45,952
They can't just vanish.

374
00:21:45,952 --> 00:21:46,688
Oh no!

375
00:21:46,688 --> 00:21:48,832
Without their smell of bat dung,

376
00:21:48,832 --> 00:21:49,856
we'd be in trouble.

377
00:21:49,856 --> 00:21:50,882
They must be hiding.

378
00:21:50,882 --> 00:21:52,242
Sit! You'll capsize the boat.

379
00:21:54,784 --> 00:21:55,763
Listen.

380
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,000
The strange noise stopped.

381
00:22:11,584 --> 00:22:12,603
Be careful.

382
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,952
Third Master.

383
00:22:38,432 --> 00:22:39,552
What's in the water?

384
00:23:08,603 --> 00:23:09,922
Look at his fingers.

385
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:12,083
These are no ordinary fingers.

386
00:23:14,656 --> 00:23:18,752
This is the Twin-Finger Tomb Probing
from ancient Chinese martial arts.

387
00:23:18,752 --> 00:23:20,283
Developing such martial arts

388
00:23:21,363 --> 00:23:23,242
takes decades of training.

389
00:23:38,642 --> 00:23:39,882
This is it earlier.

390
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:41,123
It's a water beetle.

391
00:23:41,682 --> 00:23:42,603
You squashed it

392
00:23:42,603 --> 00:23:43,722
before I interrogate it!

393
00:23:43,763 --> 00:23:44,962
This isn't a water beetle,

394
00:23:45,162 --> 00:23:46,202
but a corpse beetle.

395
00:23:46,363 --> 00:23:48,563
These are omnivorous creatures.

396
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:52,083
I bet there are

397
00:23:52,642 --> 00:23:55,003
many more of them upstream.

398
00:23:56,843 --> 00:23:57,563
Third Master.

399
00:23:57,682 --> 00:23:58,962
I guess these corpse beetles

400
00:23:59,242 --> 00:24:00,323
don't bite living people?

401
00:24:02,162 --> 00:24:02,962
They don't, usually.

402
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:04,162
But when starving,

403
00:24:04,922 --> 00:24:05,803
they will.

404
00:24:05,803 --> 00:24:06,922
Do you know about hyenas?

405
00:24:06,922 --> 00:24:08,402
They usually eat carrion when hungry.

406
00:24:08,682 --> 00:24:09,922
But when starving,

407
00:24:10,043 --> 00:24:11,442
they'll even attack buffalo.

408
00:24:13,442 --> 00:24:14,722
Then why are they

409
00:24:15,003 --> 00:24:16,563
loitering around here?

410
00:24:18,283 --> 00:24:19,482
The carrion in the cave

411
00:24:20,323 --> 00:24:21,283
are all consumed?

412
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,882
They were probably fleeing earlier.

413
00:24:24,402 --> 00:24:25,402
Fleeing?

414
00:24:26,563 --> 00:24:28,123
Something's approaching,

415
00:24:28,803 --> 00:24:29,962
and it's something big.

416
00:24:30,482 --> 00:24:31,642
What is that?

417
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,043
Explain yourself.

418
00:24:33,242 --> 00:24:34,202
Let's not dwell on

419
00:24:34,202 --> 00:24:35,202
what that thing is.

420
00:24:35,202 --> 00:24:36,323
We should get out.

421
00:24:36,523 --> 00:24:37,722
We have been here not long.

422
00:24:37,722 --> 00:24:38,922
It's not too late to go back.

423
00:24:38,922 --> 00:24:39,763
I agree.

424
00:24:39,763 --> 00:24:40,843
Let's retreat first.

425
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:42,162
We can cross the mountain.

426
00:24:42,162 --> 00:24:43,363
We might lose a few days,

427
00:24:43,363 --> 00:24:44,363
but I think it's okay.

428
00:24:47,642 --> 00:24:48,523
Bro.

429
00:24:48,682 --> 00:24:49,763
Any thoughts?

430
00:24:51,482 --> 00:24:53,123
They're certain we can't escape.

431
00:24:53,123 --> 00:24:54,323
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean?

432
00:24:55,456 --> 00:24:56,608
The exit is blocked.

433
00:25:02,162 --> 00:25:04,123
Third Master,
we could retrieve the cattle

434
00:25:04,123 --> 00:25:05,763
and push the luggage back.

435
00:25:05,763 --> 00:25:06,642
Fine. You try it.

436
00:25:06,642 --> 00:25:08,442
The cattle can't even stand on the boat.

437
00:25:08,642 --> 00:25:09,803
They knew

438
00:25:09,803 --> 00:25:11,083
they can trap you here.

439
00:25:12,922 --> 00:25:14,043
I didn't expect

440
00:25:14,043 --> 00:25:15,642
to be fooled by two village fools!

441
00:25:16,202 --> 00:25:17,123
Third Master.

442
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,402
We underestimated them.

443
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:20,803
They're capable.

444
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:23,003
Not them,

445
00:25:23,003 --> 00:25:24,563
but this place.

446
00:25:26,523 --> 00:25:27,843
They're sure

447
00:25:28,523 --> 00:25:30,642
this place can finish us.

448
00:25:53,882 --> 00:25:54,944
Third Master.

449
00:26:59,904 --> 00:27:00,800
Pan Zi!

450
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,763
Pan Zi!

451
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:06,336
Pan Zi!

452
00:27:06,496 --> 00:27:07,083
Pan Zi!

453
00:27:15,922 --> 00:27:16,803
Young Third Master.

454
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,288
Wu Xie.

455
00:27:44,962 --> 00:27:45,722
Wu Xie.

456
00:28:30,368 --> 00:28:31,296
