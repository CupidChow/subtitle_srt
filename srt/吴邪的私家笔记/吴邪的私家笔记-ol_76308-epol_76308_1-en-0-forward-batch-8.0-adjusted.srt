1
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,880
(In ancient times,)

2
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,760
(a meteorite split into nine fragments
that fell to Earth.)

3
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,039
(Where meteorites fell,)

4
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,359
(all lifeforms
were contaminated by radiation,)

5
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:35,800
(transforming
into entirely new lifeforms.)

6
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,079
(In isolated environments,)

7
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,159
(they formed self-contained ecosystems.)

8
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,320
(Humanity)

9
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:46,320
(couldn't survive
within these ecological chains.)

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,920
(Ancient people considered this
divine revelation.)

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,600
(They constructed temples
to worship the meteorites.)

12
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:57,520
(But the meteorites' power)

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,399
(was too extraordinary.)

14
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,240
(Those who obtained them)

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,880
(sought to keep their existence secret.)

16
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,079
(Thus, they devised methods)

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,560
(to conceal the temples.)

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,799
(Yet these ecosystems)

19
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,359
(still exist worldwide,)

20
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,760
(awaiting new waves
of greedy opportunists)

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,560
(and unsuspecting trespassers.)

22
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:34,656
(Dart Summit, Hezhou, 1920s)

23
00:01:44,627 --> 00:01:45,467
Well.

24
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,280
Now we're

25
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,599
in deep trouble.

26
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,560
(Old Smoker)
The soil's bloody.

27
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:56,000
(Young Wu Laogou)
There's a blood corpse down there.

28
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,359
If we mess this up,

29
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,040
everything we've got

30
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,319
will get buried below.

31
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,079
Yes or no? Just one word.

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,120
(Er Yazi)
Stop this nonsense.

33
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,560
(Beardy)
Respect your great-grandpa!

34
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,680
When he was tomb raiding,

35
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,799
you were still a fetus.

36
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:12,000
I wasn't wrong.

37
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,560
Our ancestors said

38
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,239
blood corpses bring good fortune.

39
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,319
Want to lose your head?

40
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,919
Your second great-uncle

41
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,439
dug up one of these
by South River earlier.

42
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,319
He's still crazy to this day.

43
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:30,039
No idea what cursed him.

44
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,199
Down or not? Decide now.

45
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,000
No more excuses.

46
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,599
When

47
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,919
the hole's ready,

48
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,199
I'll go first.

49
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,639
Er Yazi, bring up the rear
with the drag hoe.

50
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,439
San Yazi,

51
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,520
stay up here.

52
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,360
If we all go down,
there's no time to retreat.

53
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,120
Hold the drag hoe's tail up here.

54
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,680
When we shout from below,

55
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,759
pull it out immediately.

56
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,000
I don't want to stay.

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,840
I'm going down too.

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,159
I'll dig right now.

59
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,639
You brat! Are you testing my patience?

60
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,759
Got a death wish?

61
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,719
Enough!

62
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,280
Boys, gear up.

63
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,360
Let's work.

64
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,319
I'll find you a golden blade down there.

65
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,319
Be good.

66
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,319
It's dangerous.

67
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:19,400
Er Yazi,

68
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,360
are you done?

69
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,400
Quiet.

70
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,600
Stay there and hold the rope tight.

71
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,360
Move quicker.

72
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,079
Try harder.

73
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,199
Quieter!

74
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,279
There is movement.

75
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,000
San Yazi!

76
00:04:58,879 --> 00:04:59,719
Pull!

77
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,480
Poison!

78
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,519
It's poison!

79
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,560
San Yazi,

80
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,879
run!

81
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,240
Er Yazi?

00:08:34,228 --> 00:08:39,051
(Wu Laogou's Notes)

84
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,840
(My name is Wu Xie.)

85
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,879
(The San Yazi from the story)

86
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:46,159
(was my grandfather.)

87
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,799
(He was a tomb raider in Hezhou.)

88
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,840
(He got his education after 1949)

89
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,559
(and recognized his past mistakes.)

90
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,919
(Wu Xie)
(To start anew,)

91
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,120
(he gave away his wealth,)

92
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,279
(married into Hangzhou,)

93
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,759
(and opened an antique shop.)

94
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,320
(My grandfather never told me)

95
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,519
(how he survived back then.)

96
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,840
(But that blood corpse he mentioned)

97
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,080
(was his poisoned second brother.)

98
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,679
(And the bizarre experiences)

99
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,840
(in his notes made me)

100
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,000
(believe)

101
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,440
(that there must be sides of him
I've never seen.)

102
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,240
Xie,

103
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,559
remember this.

104
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,919
The clever ones always claim
with confidence,

105
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,720
"See beyond mountains

106
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,120
and see beyond waters."

107
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,480
But

108
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,480
the truly remarkable people

109
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:43,360
see mountains as mountains

110
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:45,759
and water as water.

111
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,639
Fifth Master.

112
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,600
Alright.

113
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,759
Be careful.

114
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,120
How many times have I told you?

115
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,120
The things you did in the past

116
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,200
will become responsibilities

117
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,919
you'll carry in the days to come.

118
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,560
Just go.

119
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:22,120
I'll handle this matter.

120
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,440
Okay.

121
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,440
Xie.

122
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,840
(My grandfather spent his entire life)

123
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,120
(trying to resolve
the karmic consequences.)

124
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,600
(The accounts in this notebook
seem thrilling,)

125
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,759
(but they were shackles
to my grandfather)

126
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,440
(that bound him until his dying day.)

(Wushanju)

130

(As you can see,)

131
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:44,600
(to this day,)

132

(Since childhood,)

134
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,800
(I've rarely)

135
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,720
(ventured beyond my doorstep.)

136
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,639
(When will my legendary life)

137
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,960
(finally begin?)

138
00:13:24,692 --> 00:13:28,800
(Jin Wantang, 'Gold Tooth')

139
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:33,639
Do you accept rubbings here?

140
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,280
We do.

141
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:37,559
Prices aren't high.

142
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:43,279
Let me ask you something.

143
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:46,519
Do you have rubbings
of an ancient silk manuscript?

144
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,759
I mean the one from decades ago

145
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:50,559
that some tomb raiders
from Hezhou retrieved

146
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:53,080
but later got swindled out of.

147
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,039
You just said it was swindled out of.

148
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,559
How would I have it?

149
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:02,080
Besides, you should hunt for rubbings
at the market.

150
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,799
No one looks for a specific scroll.

151
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,240
I heard you have connections.

152
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,879
Lao Yang sent me.

153
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,120
I know the rules.

154
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,360
This is the token.

155
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,080
Fine, let's say Lao Yang sent you.

156
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:35,719
What do you want?

157
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,559
I'm not here

158
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:38,960
to see you.

159
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,840
I came to meet your grandfather.

160
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:45,159
Didn't he once dig for treasures?

161
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,120
What's your game?

162
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,879
No games.

163
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:52,399
I just want to ask

164
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:54,879
if your grandfather has kept

165
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:56,440
one or two rubbings

166
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,000
of the silk manuscript

167
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,279
retrieved from Dart Summit in Hezhou.

168
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,239
Wang Meng,

169
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:02,399
see him out.

170
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:04,919
What's this about?

171
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:05,799
We had a good chat.

172
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:07,200
Why are you throwing me out?

173
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,040
Please leave now.

174
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:11,320
At least check out what I brought.

175
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,080
I've brought it.

176
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,440
Just take one glance, won't you?

177
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,280
Wang Meng.

178
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,200
Just do it for Lao Yang's sake.

179
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,920
Fine.

180
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,480
For Lao Yang's sake.

181
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:26,080
(Ancient silk manuscript's rubbing)

182
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,399
Take a look.

183
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,600
It's a photocopy?

184
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:35,240
You're no amateur.

185
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,440
Who carries real treasures

186
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,759
around the streets?

187
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,240
They'd crumble to dust.

188
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:44,360
Besides, every trade has its own ways.

189
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,600
Your grandfather was too young

190
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,360
when he started tomb raiding,

191
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,840
which broke the rules.

192
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,480
This thing

193
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,960
is well-preserved,

194
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,000
but

195
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:04,479
it's a fake.

196
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,879
A fake?

197
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:07,759
That can't be.

198
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,559
Anyway, I can't verify it.

199
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:12,200
Go find another expert.

200
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,040
Wait.

201
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,960
Does this match
what your grandfather saw

202
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,000
back then?

203
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,919
Let me be honest.

204
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:21,519
My grandfather was illiterate back then.

205
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,000
He couldn't read this.

206
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,240
I can't tell you.

207
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:25,639
What a coincidence.

208
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,360
Yes, indeed.

209
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
Seems like there's really no hope left.

210
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,279
Right.

211
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,399
Got it.

212
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,639
Collecting ancient texts
is complicated business.

213
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,559
You shouldn't get too greedy.

214
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,320
Young man,

215
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:49,559
see you around.

216
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,879
See you around.

217
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,600
I'm leaving.

218
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,440
See you.

219
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:19,920
Wang Meng,

220
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,760
the camera.

221
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:29,960
You left something.

222
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:32,160
Thank you.

223
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,680
We'll meet again.

224
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,640
(Wushanju)
(Little did I know then)

225
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:44,519
(that his appearance
would change my entire life.)

226
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,079
(This silk manuscript)

227
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:06,839
(resembles the one
my grandfather had then.)

228
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,799
(I'm almost certain)

229
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,240
(they're part of the same set.)

230
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:12,440
(My gut tells me)

231
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,000
(Third Uncle)
(this silk manuscript holds secrets.)

232
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,920
(I plan to ask Third Uncle.)

233
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:19,759
(In our family,)

234
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:21,599
(only he inherited Grandpa's skills.)

235
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:23,559
(In many ways,)

236
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:25,480
(he's even better than Grandpa was.)

237
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:28,160
(People outside call him Third Master.)

238
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,440
(Due to business reasons,)

239
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:33,640
(Third Uncle usually responds
to phone calls promptly.)

240
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,720
(But there's always a day or two,)

241
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:37,279
(like today,)

242
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,960
(when he becomes totally unreachable,)

243
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,559
(as if he's vanished.)

244
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:16,113
(Wu Sanxing)

245
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:32,720
(Third Uncle)
Nine o'clock.

246
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,880
(Good stuff. Come quick.)
Chicken-eye yellow sand.

247
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,080
Dragon's Spine.

248
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,280
Come quick.

249
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,839
(Many years later,)

250
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,240
(I would recall)

251
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,400
(that from the moment I brought)

252
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,119
(the manuscript to Third Uncle,)

253
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,279
(my life)

254
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:55,480
(would undergo earth-shaking changes.)

255
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,960
Third Uncle,

256
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,440
why didn't you wait for me?

257
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,480
Your junk food's all ready.

258
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,320
Hurry up.

259
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:01,519
Can you eat now?

260
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:02,880
You left me dinner,

261
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,119
not Dragon's Spine?

262
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,839
Fine.

263
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,720
It's not the first time anyway.

264
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,960
You trick me every time.

265
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,319
To you,

266
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:15,359
that thing is similar to Dragon's Spine.

267
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,839
There'll be new good stuff tomorrow.

268
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:18,559
Eat first.

269
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,359
Really?

270
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:22,279
Tomorrow's stuff
will be three times better.

271
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:25,759
Just eat your junk.

272
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:26,799
Such a feast.

273
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:27,759
I wonder

274
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,440
why anyone would eat the junk.

275
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,799
Third Uncle,

276
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:37,240
why wouldn't you hold
that good stuff longer for me?

277
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,559
What stuff?

278
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,000
Dragon's Spine.

279
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,920
I took one look at its shape

280
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:46,160
and knew roughly what was inside.

281
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,759
An ancient weapon.

282
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:51,599
Right?

283
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,960
But strangely enough,

284
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:59,000
the person who bought Dragon's Spine

285
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,279
didn't look very old.

286
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,359
What's his background?

287
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,920
So wealthy.

288
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,319
Must be some rich kid.

289
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:07,039
Don't you know the rules?

290
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,079
Don't ask about missed treasures.

291
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,920
If you missed it, you missed it.

292
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,839
Take the loss.

293
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:12,679
Understand?

294
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:15,279
I don't even want that thing.

295
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:16,920
What I encountered today

296
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,680
was way more impressive than yours.

297
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,160
It's literally
the most bizarre thing I've seen

298
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,440
since entering this trade.

299
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,279
More bizarre than what you're eating?

300
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,039
About the same.

301
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:27,079
Try some.

302
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:27,599
Get lost.

303
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,640
Stop bothering me.

304
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,160
Come on, take one.

305
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:31,440
It's delicious.

306
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,960
Get me a tissue.

307
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,519
This is dog food.

308
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:45,640
Don't waste it.

309
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,880
Shut up.

310
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,720
What exactly are you here for?

311
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,720
Out with it.

312
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,519
Actually,

313
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:54,039
this afternoon,

314
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:55,960
a strange old man came to my shop.

315
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,440
He had a gold tooth.

316
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,559
He wanted me
to check out this silk manuscript.

317
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,000
Truth is,

318
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,880
he wanted to see Grandpa's manuscript.

319
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,599
I compared them.

320
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:07,440
It resembles the one in Grandpa's notes.

321
00:23:09,843 --> 00:23:11,808
(Ancient silk manuscript's rubbing)

322
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,519
Look, Third Uncle.

323
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:17,480
Your expression changed.

324
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,880
Are you feeling
a little stirred up inside?

325
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:23,759
Third Uncle.

326
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,119
Third Uncle.

327
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:28,359
Release your inner passion.

328
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:29,959
Get lost.

329
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:33,240
Doesn't this look like a fox to you?

330
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:34,599
An ancient silk manuscript

331
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,440
is worthless

332
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,920
unless it's a unique copy.

333
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:38,959
Understand?

334
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:39,759
Take it.

335
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:40,599
Wait.

336
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,960
I only understand parts of it.

337
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:44,599
It mentions

338
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:47,839
a feudal lord from Lu State

339
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,759
and records some events from his life.

340
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,160
Keep going.

341
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,000
Come on.

342
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,880
It says

343
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,079
he possessed a Gui Seal.

344
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:01,359
(This Gui Seal)

345
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,119
(could command a special army.)

346
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,839
(That army's soldiers
only moved at night)

347
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:11,680
(and had unusual physiques.)

348
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:13,720
(They left)

349
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,640
(no footprints wherever they walked.)

350
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:21,240
(Third Uncle, this is made up, right?)

351
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,640
(Even fiction has real-world origins.)

352
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,160
Something still feels off.

353
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,920
This silk manuscript is strange.

354
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,759
Not the legend itself.

355
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:36,599
No footprints? Easy to explain.

356
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,400
A broom tied behind one's waist
could do that.

357
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,240
What's strange is,

358
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:44,160
at first glance
of this fox-face pattern,

359
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,440
it looks like a stain.

360
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,960
But if it were a stain,

361
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,680
how could it look so vivid
and three-dimensional?

362
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,720
Maybe someone intentionally painted it?

363
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,880
But why would they

364
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,480
disguise it as a stain?

365
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,359
To hide something?

366
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,640
Not bad.

367
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:02,720
You're observant.

368
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,400
But your knowledge is lacking.

369
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,160
I've repeatedly invited you here

370
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,920
to learn from me, but you refuse.

371
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,640
Now you can't decipher it.

372
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,440
This is a map.

373
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,480
A map?

374
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,320
Yes.

375
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,759
The ancients called it

376
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,559
the Eight-Array Diagram

377
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:24,200
or Pictorial Text.

378
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:25,920
It encodes a location's

379
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,400
exact geographical details

380
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,119
through special syntax,

381
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:31,000
disguised as a legend

382
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,440
but packed with information.

383
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:37,400
Frankly, besides me,

384
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:39,759
fewer than five people worldwide
can read this.

385
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,880
So you're saying,

386
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:44,640
find a specific spot,

387
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,119
turn left,

388
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:48,720
then right until a tree,

389
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,480
go straight, then right,

390
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,319
find a well,

391
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:53,000
and jump in?

392
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,359
Exactly.

393
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:55,839
That's what it means.

394
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:57,359
Just jump in when finding a well.

395
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,319
That well's reserved for you.

396
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,880
What now?

397
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:04,279
I don't know how.

398
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:05,400
No one's born knowing this.

399
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:07,599
Fine.

400
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,160
I'll explain it to you now.

401
00:26:11,315 --> 00:26:12,768
(Study of Stars)

402
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:15,880
(Each of these symbols)

403
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,880
(represents a different star.)

404
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,559
(But more importantly,)

405
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:21,559
(they can form)

406
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,839
(hundreds of combinations.)

407
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,400
(Let's take this set of symbols
as an example.)

408
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,000
(By connecting these stars)

409
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:32,960
(we can create a topographic map.)

410
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,240
(By combining layers
of topographic maps,)

411
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,960
(the area indicated by the final map
progressively shrinks)

412
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:41,279
(and becomes more specific.)

413
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,440
It's actually very simple.

414
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:44,599
Got it?

415
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:46,759
Such a complex map.

416
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,559
Where exactly does it point?

417
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,799
And this manuscript is clearly a fake.

418
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,400
Though it's a fake,

419
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,119
its contents might still be genuine.

420
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:55,400
I'll look into it.

421
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:56,680
Third Uncle,

422
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,039
I understand now.

423
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:01,119
You're saying someone deliberately

424
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,400
created this map

425
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:03,960
and recorded the story of Lu State?

426
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:05,640
Third Uncle,

427
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,119
you're so interested.

428
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,119
Do you want
to visit the map's marked spot?

429
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,160
Third Uncle,

430
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,000
this is exactly like

431
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,119
the opening scene
of Raiders of the Lost Ark.

432
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:15,439
Third Uncle,

433
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,400
let me go with you, okay?

434
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,599
I want to join you

435
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:21,160
in embarking on this journey.

436
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,640
You can come.

437
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:24,960
I see no problem.

438
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,680
Let's call your dad first, alright?

439
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:31,079
If he agrees, anything goes.

440
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:34,839
Never mind. Forget it.

441
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:35,640
Third Uncle,

442
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,000
no need to involve my dad.

443
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:38,359
Think carefully, Third Uncle.

444
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,440
I'm old enough now

445
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,920
to go out and see the world.

446
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,400
Take me with you.

447
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,079
I'll obey you...

448
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:43,919
Listen to me.

449
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,119
Call your dad first.

450
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:46,799
If he approves, I'll take you.

451
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,680
Let's see if he'll break your legs.

452
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:51,000
How will you walk without legs?

453
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,720
Come on.

454
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,759
Want me to call him?

455
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,839
If I say Wu Xie wants to go with me,

456
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,200
he'll come to break your legs.

457
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,040
If you won't take me,

458
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,279
then stop reading it.

459
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,359
Where are you?

460
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:19,119
There's a lead on that earlier matter.

461
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,400
I need your help.

462
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:26,160
(Third Uncle will definitely
call me back.)

463
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,960
(The map's still with me.)

464
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:30,240
(He can't possibly not call me back.)

465
00:28:45,428 --> 00:28:50,624
(Web Article:
How to Capture a Man's Heart.)

466
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,039
(He's really not calling me back?)

467
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:55,480
(Could he have memorized the whole map?)

468
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,040
Third Uncle.

469
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:09,759
Third Uncle.

470
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:10,519
Third Uncle,

471
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:11,880
long time no see.

472
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,080
Well,

473
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,640
Third Uncle,

474
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,960
I've always felt in this family,

475
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,640
you're the one who understands me best.

476
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:18,359
When you were young,

477
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,759
you defied the family's objections

478
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:21,039
to pursue what you wanted too.

479
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,079
The world belongs
to the brave and visionary

480
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:24,680
who pursue and explore.

481
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:26,159
I know

482
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,079
your care and love for me are boundless.

483
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:30,319
You taught me

484
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:32,519
about the vastness of this world.

485
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,319
Third Uncle,

486
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:36,319
please take me with you.

487
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,240
Third Uncle.

488
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,480
Where'd you get this act?

489
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,559
How long did you rehearse?

490
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,720
Jane Eyre.

491
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:43,880
Then go home. Won't walk you out.

492
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,960
Wait, Third Uncle,

493
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,839
I'm begging you.

494
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,960
Let's get to the point.

495
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,720
Okay?

496
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,079
Anyway, the map's in my hands.

497
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:49,880
You can't memorize

498
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,559
hundreds of symbols
even with your memory.

499
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,519
You're resourceful,

500
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:53,640
and I can't outsmart you.

501
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,240
But if you won't take me,

502
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,359
I'll tear it up.

503
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,079
We'll go our separate ways then.

504
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,480
Threatening me now?

505
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,039
Where'd you get this?

506
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,039
Think it over carefully.

507
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:07,839
Wait.

508
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,240
Third Uncle. Third Uncle.

509
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,280
Third Uncle.

510
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:14,399
What's wrong?

511
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,920
You've already contacted Gold Tooth?

512
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:20,039
In the antique circle,

513
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,880
you can't survive
without some shrewdness.

514
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:24,359
Someone like you

515
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,519
will squander our family fortune
sooner or later.

516
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,880
About Gold Tooth,

517
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,079
his real name is Jin Wantang.

518
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:41,160
He's not the original owner
of this item.

519
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,599
The owner of this silk manuscript
is surnamed Ma.

520
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,160
He's a famous antique dealer.

521
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:48,799
(Five years ago,)

522
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,519
(he suddenly disappeared
without a trace.)

523
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,160
(Everything started
with this manuscript.)

524
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:55,160
(While acquiring artifacts,)

525
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,000
(he unexpectedly found this manuscript)

526
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,400
(in a northwest peasant household.)

527
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,559
(He must have realized)

528
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,359
(this manuscript was actually a map.)

529
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,160
(So he began studying it day and night.)

530
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,319
(Ma studied it for ten full years)

531
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:10,960
(before finally deciphering the map.)

532
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,599
(Then he spent a fortune)

533
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:15,960
(hiring top-tier outdoor experts.)

534
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:18,200
(But shortly after departure,)

535
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,160
(the entire team lost contact.)

536
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:26,960
(His wife only knew he went)

537
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,960
(to the location marked on the map.)

538
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,200
(Though not knowing the exact spot,)

539
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,680
(she knew
it must be extremely dangerous.)

540
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:40,200
(She kept spending money
searching for her husband)

541
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,759
(for five whole years)

542
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,279
(without finding any clues.)

543
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:45,920
(Gold Tooth)

544
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,079
(was also hired by Ma's wife.)

545
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:49,759
(He has some real skills.)

546
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,279
He discovered this manuscript originally

547
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,319
was in your grandfather's possession.

548
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:55,359
Believing your grandfather

549
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:56,720
could definitely decipher the map,

550
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,759
he approached you.

551
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:01,039
Third Uncle,

552
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,359
I was only gone for a moment,

553
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:05,400
and you've gathered
all this information?

554
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,799
Don't tell me

555
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,119
you've already taken Ma's job?

556
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,839
Do you know

557
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,720
how much he offered?

558
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,240
How much?

559
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,119
This much?

560
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:25,599
Third Uncle,

561
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,279
if you go,

562
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:29,480
you can't go alone, right?

563
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:32,640
Then why tell me all this?

564
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,359
Are you taking me too?

565
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:37,599
Why?

566
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,039
Give me one good reason to take you.

567
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,000
I

568
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:45,960
could probably

569
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,200
help carry some equipment.

570
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,680
Alright.

571
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,240
Our basic equipment

572
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,920
starts at

573
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,279
fifty kilograms minimum.

574
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,559
Two people means a hundred kilos.

575
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,480
But

576
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,559
I need two more team members.

577
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:01,960
Four people
means two hundred kilos total.

578
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,240
Who will you carry for?

579
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,319
Will you carry mine?

580
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:07,319
Your own gear too, right?

581
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,119
Can you handle a hundred kilos?

582
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,359
Enough.

583
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,839
Just say you don't want me to go.

584
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,880
Fine, I'm leaving.

585
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:17,480
My shop opens tomorrow.

586
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:18,679
Bye.

587
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,559
Leaving so soon?

588
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,839
As a Wu,

589
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,519
you gave up so easily?

590
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,799
Seems like

591
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:46,599
you didn't really want to go anyway.

592
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:49,519
What do you mean?

593
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:52,200
You'll take me?

594
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:57,200
Your dad agreed.

595
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,599
This is a search mission.

596
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:03,920
He says it's relatively safe.

597
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:05,960
I don't want our family's only heir

598
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,200
to miss out on adventuring.

599
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,480
But this is the last time.

600
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,000
Your coming with me

601
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,119
is better than your sneaking off alone.

602
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,360
Two things before departure.

603
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:19,999
First,

604
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,440
crack the code.

605
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,559
Second,

606
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,199
recruit two more members.

607
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,159
Got headshotted again.

608
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,192
He sees through walls?

609
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,240
He's cheating?

610
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,960
Who is it? Who's cheating?

611
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,239
That guy over there.

612
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,159
Bro, that brat's definitely cheating.

613
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,079
He's won ten rounds,
making us look idiotic!

614
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,800
That brat.

615
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:10,519
Buddy,

616
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:12,639
having fun?

617
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,320
You're a cheater, right?

618
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,639
Say something!

619
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,000
You think you're the boss here?

620
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,079
When someone talks to you,

621
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:30,760
you should respond properly.

622
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:33,559
Didn't your mother
teach you any manners?

623
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:36,559
Stop looking at me!

624
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:57,559
Your phone.

625
00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:00,352
(Wu Sanxing: Got a job. Come quick.)

626
00:36:03,731 --> 00:36:06,239
(Xingao Internet Cafe)

627
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:07,079
How are you?

628
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:08,519
Are you guys okay?

629
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,760
Ma'am,

630
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,760
don't cry.

631
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,440
Hello, doctor.

632
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:15,880
Thank you for your hard work.

633
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,760
Wait.

634
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,760
I wanted a 20 yuan discount
on the nursing fee.

635
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,960
Is crying really necessary?

636
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,280
When doing business,

637
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,719
there's always some haggling.

638
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,679
No 20-yuan discount anymore.

639
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:33,400
Okay?

640
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,239
Okay?

641
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,079
Stop crying.

642
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:37,800
How about ten?

643
00:36:50,227 --> 00:36:55,744
(Third Master: Got a job. Come quick.)

644
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,320
Stop crying.

645
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,119
Stop it!

646
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,960
I'll raise it by 20.

647
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,880
50?

648
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:07,760
Take good care of my mom.

649
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,039
You have my word.

650
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:27,360
(The helpers Third Uncle
found this time)

651
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,280
(are familiar to me.)

652
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,679
(This is Pan Zi,)

653
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,320
(Third Uncle's
longest-serving subordinate.)

654
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,239
(When Third Uncle audits accounts,)

655
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:37,800
(he always brings Pan Zi.)

656
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:39,159
(With him present,)

657
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,920
(no debt goes uncollected.)

658
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:44,239
(In my memory,
anything Third Uncle demanded,)

659
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:45,880
(he could always deliver.)

660
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:48,159
(Though fierce to others)

661
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,840
(and feared by everyone,)

662
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:51,079
(he's kind to me.)

663
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:51,960
Young Third Master.

664
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,679
(He's taken me everywhere
since childhood.)

665
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,719
(This is Da Kui.)

666
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,079
(His strength is legendary.)

667
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,000
(He can kill an ox with one punch.)

668
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,000
(He operates without principles.)

669
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,280
(Except toward Third Uncle,)

670
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,360
(for others, payment alone)

671
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,000
(can make him work against allies.)

672
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,320
(He's even double-dealing.)

673
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:19,719
(I never trusted his integrity.)

674
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:20,719
(Until he retorted,)

675
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,639
("Can integrity save my mother's life?")

676
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:24,599
(That's when I knew)

677
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:26,079
(his mother was critically ill)

678
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,159
(and he needed a lot of money.)

679
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,120
Hello.

680
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:30,519
Third Master.

681
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:31,480
Sharper than ever.

682
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,760
- Third Master.
- Bulked up.

683
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,679
I got a new liquor.

684
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,640
We'll try it later.

685
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,800
This time we're retrieving one person.

686
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:38,440
The client's paying eight million.

687
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:39,760
We'll split it.

688
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:43,440
But here's the thing.

689
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,079
About where we're going,

690
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,800
I don't know yet.

691
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,840
First, we need to decipher this map.

692
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:56,156
(Ancient silk manuscript's rubbing)

693
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,880
(Kulou 10.)

694
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,079
(Zhu 8.)

695
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,800
(Beihe 1?)

696
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,639
Any progress?

697
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:16,479
Got it.

698
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:19,880
(These symbols form
an ancient Lu State terrain map.)

699
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,239
(Refine further.)

700
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,159
(Jiuqi 2.)

701
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:26,639
(Tianlao...)

702
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,920
(Sangong 1.)

703
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:30,400
(And five fuxi stars.)

704
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:39,239
Let me see.

705
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,800
It matches.

706
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:46,760
(It's Quling County
within ancient Lu territory.)

707
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:53,039
Young Third Master,

708
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:54,239
let me look again.

709
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,600
This?

710
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:57,519
Right.

711
00:39:58,359 --> 00:39:59,199
Look.

712
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:01,519
(The place called Hechuan in Quling.)

713
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:03,440
It looks like the star map.

714
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,079
Right.

715
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,039
There's hope.

716
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,519
Come on.

717
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:23,840
(Hechuan corresponds
to present-day Pengzhou.)

718
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,920
(We're almost there.)

719
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:28,119
(This shows mountain ranges.)

720
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:30,079
(This depicts rivers.)

721
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:32,559
(Stack them all together.)

722
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,760
A bit over here.

723
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:43,400
(They match.)

724
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,840
(The map's center points
to an underground cave.)

725
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,480
Let's go to Pengzhou first.

726
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,680
(We leave tomorrow.)

727
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:03,079
(We drank heavily that night.)

728
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:05,239
(I was in a daze.)

729
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:07,280
(Everything felt surreal.)

730
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,119
(I thought I'd seized this opportunity.)

731
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,159
(Am I right, Grandpa?)

732
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:29,440
