00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,952
=Episode 13=

3
00:01:41,652 --> 00:01:42,691
What are these?

4
00:01:44,652 --> 00:01:45,931
Twelve hands?

5
00:01:46,612 --> 00:01:48,452
Are there six people inside here?

6
00:01:49,972 --> 00:01:51,972
They drowned together while bathing?

7
00:01:52,892 --> 00:01:54,372
There's only one person here.

8
00:01:55,372 --> 00:01:56,291
One person?

9
00:01:56,931 --> 00:01:58,252
Look carefully at her heads.

10
00:01:58,411 --> 00:01:59,291
Notice anything?

11
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:04,332
These aren't actually her heads.

12
00:02:04,772 --> 00:02:06,252
They're just growths on her body.

13
00:02:07,611 --> 00:02:08,532
Look closely.

14
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:10,411
She indeed has twelve arms.

15
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:12,812
A human with twelve arms?

16
00:02:13,532 --> 00:02:14,731
Is that still human?

17
00:02:15,212 --> 00:02:17,092
It's clearly some sort of insect.

18
00:02:17,532 --> 00:02:18,972
Theoretically speaking,

19
00:02:19,731 --> 00:02:22,691
someone with congenital
chromosomal abnormalities

20
00:02:22,812 --> 00:02:24,691
would have
severely underdeveloped organs.

21
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:26,291
How could she grow this large?

22
00:02:28,092 --> 00:02:28,851
If you ask me,

23
00:02:28,851 --> 00:02:31,372
there's an easy way to figure this out.

24
00:02:31,372 --> 00:02:33,291
Let's hurry back to that room we were in

25
00:02:33,652 --> 00:02:35,451
and bring all those clay pots here.

26
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:37,171
When we bail out this water,

27
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:39,932
we'll see what's really underneath.

28
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:41,092
And look.

29
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:43,611
There seems to be a stone slab
down there.

30
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:46,212
We can take it out too.

31
00:02:46,492 --> 00:02:47,372
Maybe

32
00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:49,571
we can find something unexpected.

33
00:02:50,451 --> 00:02:51,252
Makes sense.

34
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:53,851
Since we came down,

35
00:02:53,932 --> 00:02:55,252
we haven't seen a single word.

36
00:02:56,411 --> 00:02:58,411
If I could read the inscription
on this stone slab,

37
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,252
we might piece together some clues.

38
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:01,851
That would greatly help

39
00:03:01,851 --> 00:03:02,932
our next steps.

40
00:03:03,891 --> 00:03:04,451
Alright.

41
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:06,171
No time to waste.

42
00:03:06,372 --> 00:03:07,332
Let's move quickly

43
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:08,691
before the mechanisms reset.

44
00:03:09,372 --> 00:03:09,891
Let's go.

45
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:26,532
Let me check if our precious air tanks

46
00:03:26,532 --> 00:03:27,372
have returned.

47
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:28,052
Any luck?

48
00:03:28,972 --> 00:03:29,411
Well,

49
00:03:29,571 --> 00:03:30,212
nope.

50
00:03:32,451 --> 00:03:32,891
Alright.

51
00:03:33,571 --> 00:03:34,731
We'll have to bail the water.

52
00:03:41,652 --> 00:03:42,451
So heavy.

53
00:03:43,492 --> 00:03:44,532
This might work.

54
00:03:53,772 --> 00:03:54,252
This one.

55
00:04:00,212 --> 00:04:00,972
Let's go.

56
00:04:01,332 --> 00:04:03,011
Why stare at the stone?

57
00:04:03,171 --> 00:04:04,052
Let's go.

58
00:04:05,451 --> 00:04:07,611
These murals tell a story.

59
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:09,212
Their construction craftsmanship

60
00:04:09,212 --> 00:04:10,851
rivals the Yong Imperial Palace itself.

61
00:04:12,972 --> 00:04:16,371
But the designs
don't look Central Plains-style.

62
00:04:17,611 --> 00:04:18,491
I can't decipher them.

63
00:04:18,931 --> 00:04:19,692
Pangzi,

64
00:04:19,972 --> 00:04:21,012
do you think...

65
00:04:24,452 --> 00:04:25,371
Pangzi?

66
00:04:26,931 --> 00:04:27,772
Pangzi?

67
00:05:12,652 --> 00:05:14,092
Good heavens.

68
00:08:46,812 --> 00:08:47,891
Darn you, Pangzi!

69
00:08:48,131 --> 00:08:49,651
You scared me half to death!

70
00:09:09,771 --> 00:09:10,651
Where...

71
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:12,412
Where were you guys?

72
00:09:16,092 --> 00:09:16,932
We...

73
00:09:18,651 --> 00:09:20,611
We got chased off by a monster.

74
00:09:21,412 --> 00:09:21,972
A monster?

75
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:24,651
You saw a monster too?

76
00:09:27,251 --> 00:09:28,412
You saw it too?

77
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:32,052
Was it covered in white fur?

78
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,011
Fast-moving with tiny hands?

79
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:35,292
White fur? No.

80
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,332
Then what did you see?

81
00:09:39,251 --> 00:09:40,572
I saw something

82
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:43,972
human-shaped.

83
00:09:44,172 --> 00:09:45,212
It launched

84
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,731
from the spring instantly.

85
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:48,452
But it definitely wasn't human.

86
00:09:49,212 --> 00:09:50,092
It's over two meters.

87
00:09:50,292 --> 00:09:51,371
Freakishly tall.

88
00:09:55,172 --> 00:09:56,011
Xiaoge,

89
00:09:56,212 --> 00:09:58,172
this place feels wrong.

90
00:10:00,092 --> 00:10:02,731
Why are there so many monsters here?

91
00:10:03,731 --> 00:10:04,572
Sea monkeys.

92
00:10:04,572 --> 00:10:05,491
What monkeys?

93
00:10:06,491 --> 00:10:07,292
Sea monkeys?

94
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:07,932
Who keeps them?

95
00:10:07,932 --> 00:10:08,771
They actually exist?

96
00:10:09,491 --> 00:10:10,491
Stop talking.

97
00:10:10,692 --> 00:10:11,932
We need to get out now.

98
00:10:12,371 --> 00:10:12,891
Okay.

99
00:10:13,172 --> 00:10:14,052
Wait.

100
00:10:14,292 --> 00:10:16,692
I just locked that sea monkey

101
00:10:16,692 --> 00:10:17,771
outside this door.

102
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,572
I'm not sure if it's left yet.

103
00:10:19,731 --> 00:10:22,491
We'll leave as soon
as the elevator activates.

104
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:26,491
Pangzi.

105
00:10:27,452 --> 00:10:29,292
What did you run into earlier?

106
00:10:40,531 --> 00:10:41,371
Let's go.

107
00:10:43,092 --> 00:10:44,812
Why stare at the stone?

108
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:48,212
I'm leaving first.

109
00:10:52,972 --> 00:10:54,292
It reeks here.

110
00:10:54,531 --> 00:10:55,251
Here.

111
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:03,692
Remember, there's a step here.

112
00:11:04,771 --> 00:11:06,332
Go down.

113
00:11:12,491 --> 00:11:13,531
Wu!

114
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:14,851
Wu Xie!

115
00:11:15,731 --> 00:11:16,292
Wu!

116
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:17,251
Stop shouting.

117
00:11:17,531 --> 00:11:18,371
He can't hear you.

118
00:11:18,771 --> 00:11:19,812
Then what do we do?

119
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:21,292
Wu!

120
00:11:29,092 --> 00:11:30,251
I get it.

121
00:11:30,452 --> 00:11:30,972
To you,

122
00:11:30,972 --> 00:11:32,972
since we're already trapped
in the elevator,

123
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:35,651
as long as it doesn't move,

124
00:11:36,531 --> 00:11:37,651
none of us can leave.

125
00:11:40,972 --> 00:11:41,771
Fine.

126
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:43,851
I agree with your plan.

127
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:46,731
Let's get to work.

128
00:11:48,371 --> 00:11:49,851
I've been thinking.

129
00:11:50,412 --> 00:11:52,011
One of us has to go down there.

130
00:11:57,011 --> 00:11:57,851
After you.

131
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:07,692
Is this even a problem?

132
00:12:09,972 --> 00:12:10,891
I'm telling you,

133
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:13,412
I

134
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:15,731
have seen some real action.

135
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:19,212
Back in the day...

136
00:12:27,812 --> 00:12:29,972
After we drained all that water,

137
00:12:30,692 --> 00:12:32,011
we hauled that thing up.

138
00:12:32,891 --> 00:12:33,692
Xiaoge,

139
00:12:35,932 --> 00:12:36,972
look at her.

140
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:40,052
She has a swollen belly.

141
00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:43,491
Could she have been pregnant?

142
00:12:48,092 --> 00:12:51,011
What's this swollen part then?

143
00:12:59,651 --> 00:13:00,572
What's wrong, Xiaoge?

144
00:13:08,011 --> 00:13:09,851
What's written here?

145
00:13:10,052 --> 00:13:11,131
Wu's not around.

146
00:13:11,932 --> 00:13:13,292
I can't read these characters.

147
00:13:14,452 --> 00:13:15,011
Xiaoge,

148
00:13:16,251 --> 00:13:17,452
do you recognize these?

149
00:13:20,052 --> 00:13:21,491
A hole is under this stone tablet.

150
00:13:22,251 --> 00:13:23,452
Under it?

151
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:25,292
How'd you know that?

152
00:13:34,572 --> 00:13:36,092
Well... There really is a hole.

153
00:13:37,172 --> 00:13:38,572
It's man-made.

154
00:13:41,292 --> 00:13:42,572
Could it be dug

155
00:13:43,651 --> 00:13:45,131
by Wu's third uncle?

156
00:13:48,812 --> 00:13:49,932
That doesn't make sense.

157
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:52,891
But

158
00:13:53,011 --> 00:13:54,611
why dig a hole here?

159
00:13:55,851 --> 00:13:57,131
Unless they encountered

160
00:13:57,131 --> 00:13:58,251
the same situation as us

161
00:13:59,412 --> 00:14:00,692
and tried to leave through here?

162
00:14:15,972 --> 00:14:16,891
What's wrong, Xiaoge?

163
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:18,692
Pangzi, don't move.

164
00:14:33,052 --> 00:14:33,611
Xiaoge!

165
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:34,212
What's that?

166
00:14:34,212 --> 00:14:35,452
Pangzi, run!

167
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:37,052
Xiaoge,

168
00:14:37,131 --> 00:14:37,972
I'll help you!

169
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:09,812
Then we just kept swimming

170
00:15:09,812 --> 00:15:10,412
and swimming

171
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:12,052
until we surfaced.

172
00:15:12,251 --> 00:15:13,371
Then we saw you,

173
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:14,491
scaring me to death.

174
00:15:14,771 --> 00:15:16,812
Why didn't you mention
how you scared me?

175
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:21,212
So you only saw a hand?

176
00:15:22,412 --> 00:15:23,212
What do you mean?

177
00:15:24,731 --> 00:15:27,452
Are you calling me a coward?

178
00:15:27,611 --> 00:15:28,491
Xiaoge's good, right?

179
00:15:29,932 --> 00:15:31,771
Even he turned tail
and ran from that thing.

180
00:15:32,092 --> 00:15:34,371
You think I'd play hero for no reason?

181
00:15:35,011 --> 00:15:36,812
Speaking of which, I have a question.

182
00:15:36,972 --> 00:15:38,692
What exactly was that thing?

183
00:15:39,332 --> 00:15:40,771
Is it that terrifying?

184
00:15:41,092 --> 00:15:42,611
It's a small-clawed otter.

185
00:15:42,611 --> 00:15:44,052
Possibly mutated.

186
00:15:44,052 --> 00:15:46,812
It lurks in putrid, damp places.

187
00:15:47,932 --> 00:15:49,172
If we kill it,

188
00:15:49,452 --> 00:15:51,131
it releases toxic gas.

189
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:52,412
So running was smart.

190
00:15:52,692 --> 00:15:53,452
No argument here.

191
00:15:58,212 --> 00:15:59,491
That means

192
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:03,011
the tunnel you came through

193
00:16:03,572 --> 00:16:05,052
leads to this pool?

194
00:16:08,011 --> 00:16:09,212
Then why...

195
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:12,932
What's the point of this?

196
00:16:24,491 --> 00:16:25,651
Is he losing his mind?

197
00:16:34,131 --> 00:16:34,932
Wu,

198
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:37,611
why are you staring at the stone again?

199
00:16:40,172 --> 00:16:41,332
I forgot to mention earlier.

200
00:16:42,052 --> 00:16:44,292
I think the carvings
on these ballast stones

201
00:16:44,812 --> 00:16:46,412
are narrative paintings.

202
00:16:46,452 --> 00:16:47,251
What?

203
00:16:48,011 --> 00:16:48,812
Narrative paintings.

204
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:50,052
Of what story?

205
00:16:53,731 --> 00:16:54,692
It's indeed a story.

206
00:16:55,812 --> 00:16:56,812
Were they building

207
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:57,972
something?

208
00:16:57,972 --> 00:16:59,051
I don't understand this.

209
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,251
- Don't block my view.
- This guy was pretentious.

210
00:17:04,771 --> 00:17:06,091
Everyone was facing forward.

211
00:17:06,132 --> 00:17:08,212
Only he was facing the other way.

212
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:09,932
Facing the sea,

213
00:17:10,932 --> 00:17:12,011
awaiting spring blossoms?

214
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:13,571
Who is he?

215
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:16,771
I guess

216
00:17:16,972 --> 00:17:18,612
this one carved on the stone

217
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,412
must be the shipwreck's owner.

218
00:17:21,531 --> 00:17:22,372
Why?

219
00:17:22,571 --> 00:17:24,412
Look at this part.

220
00:17:24,972 --> 00:17:27,452
The architectural techniques shown here

221
00:17:27,452 --> 00:17:28,531
resemble those from here.

222
00:17:29,172 --> 00:17:30,251
And he designed many

223
00:17:30,251 --> 00:17:31,452
peculiar mechanisms.

224
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:33,091
The design

225
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,972
is similar to the elevator here.

226
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:36,972
You mean this?

227
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:38,932
There's some resemblance.

228
00:17:39,412 --> 00:17:40,132
Then what?

229
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:42,652
However,

230
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,212
that actually narrows down
who it could be.

231
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:48,452
What are you talking about?

232
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,372
How does that narrow it down?

233
00:17:50,372 --> 00:17:51,731
Because master craftsmen back then

234
00:17:51,731 --> 00:17:52,771
were actually rare.

235
00:17:53,652 --> 00:17:54,372
First,

236
00:17:54,652 --> 00:17:55,811
it was six centuries ago.

237
00:17:56,452 --> 00:17:57,251
Second,

238
00:17:57,771 --> 00:17:58,852
he needed to be qualified

239
00:17:58,852 --> 00:17:59,972
to construct

240
00:18:00,011 --> 00:18:01,932
a project rivaling
the Yong Imperial Palace.

241
00:18:02,692 --> 00:18:03,531
Third,

242
00:18:03,531 --> 00:18:06,372
he needed expertise
in fengshui and mystical arts.

243
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:11,291
To meet all three criteria,

244
00:18:12,452 --> 00:18:14,091
he could only be...

245
00:18:14,212 --> 00:18:14,972
Wang Zanghai.

246
00:18:15,531 --> 00:18:15,932
Right.

247
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:16,811
Wang Zanghai.

248
00:18:17,771 --> 00:18:18,571
Who's that?

249
00:18:19,251 --> 00:18:20,412
You scared me.

250
00:18:20,811 --> 00:18:22,331
Wang Zanghai was an extraordinary man.

251
00:18:23,091 --> 00:18:24,412
His mastery of fengshui

252
00:18:24,412 --> 00:18:26,132
was unparalleled.

253
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:27,291
Back then,

254
00:18:27,531 --> 00:18:29,972
(he was ordered to design
the entire Yong Imperial Palace)

255
00:18:30,852 --> 00:18:32,811
(and several major cities as well.)

256
00:18:36,412 --> 00:18:37,731
(A single command from him)

257
00:18:37,932 --> 00:18:40,331
(could make entire cities
vanish overnight.)

258
00:18:41,932 --> 00:18:45,172
By the Mandate of Heaven,
the Emperor decrees.

259
00:18:45,612 --> 00:18:47,251
Appoint Chief Constructor

260
00:18:47,452 --> 00:18:49,972
and Master Carpenter
of the Imperial Palace,

261
00:18:50,331 --> 00:18:51,412
Wang Zanghai,

262
00:18:51,652 --> 00:18:53,731
(Imperial Edict)
as the Left Vice Minister of Works.

263
00:18:53,972 --> 00:18:55,372
He's granted second-rank status

264
00:18:55,491 --> 00:18:58,331
with a first-rank official salary.

265
00:18:58,731 --> 00:19:00,412
So it is decreed.

266
00:19:05,536 --> 00:19:06,656
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

267
00:19:06,656 --> 00:19:07,488
Slow down!

268
00:19:07,488 --> 00:19:08,692
Fly it higher!

269
00:19:10,932 --> 00:19:12,212
Higher!

270
00:19:13,312 --> 00:19:14,848
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty, be careful!

271
00:19:14,848 --> 00:19:15,840
- Slow down!
- A little higher!

272
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,771
- Your Majesty!
- Slow down!

273
00:19:17,212 --> 00:19:17,731
Your Majesty!

274
00:19:17,731 --> 00:19:18,091
Higher!

275
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:19,932
(I've read some texts by him.)

276
00:19:20,172 --> 00:19:21,932
(About his works on fengshui.)

277
00:19:22,852 --> 00:19:24,892
They contain insights
into cosmic secrets,

278
00:19:24,892 --> 00:19:26,251
profound beyond measure.

279
00:19:28,531 --> 00:19:29,531
(But unfortunately,)

280
00:19:30,011 --> 00:19:30,731
(most of those)

281
00:19:30,811 --> 00:19:32,531
(weren't preserved by his descendants.)

282
00:19:33,571 --> 00:19:34,972
(The majority were lost.)

283
00:19:36,172 --> 00:19:37,091
But consider,

284
00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:38,612
such a man

285
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,011
could build a ship

286
00:19:41,331 --> 00:19:42,771
that resists decay for millennia.

287
00:19:44,172 --> 00:19:45,212
Totally effortlessly.

288
00:19:45,892 --> 00:19:46,731
You are right.

289
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,531
Never imagined

290
00:19:49,892 --> 00:19:52,372
an architect could do all this.

291
00:19:53,212 --> 00:19:54,692
But these are just my speculations.

292
00:19:55,972 --> 00:19:57,852
If we could find any written records,

293
00:19:58,011 --> 00:19:59,531
I could confirm if my speculations

294
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,852
are right or wrong.

295
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:04,452
Didn't you say

296
00:20:04,452 --> 00:20:06,251
the female corpse you saw

297
00:20:06,251 --> 00:20:08,771
was on top of a stone slab
with inscriptions on it?

298
00:20:09,051 --> 00:20:10,531
Do you remember what was on it?

299
00:20:10,771 --> 00:20:11,531
Don't mention it.

300
00:20:12,852 --> 00:20:15,531
The sight of that white-haired monster
scared me half to death.

301
00:20:15,811 --> 00:20:17,132
How could I remember any of that?

302
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:22,771
Speaking of the white-haired monster,
it does jog my memory.

303
00:20:23,452 --> 00:20:26,331
I keep feeling like
I've seen it somewhere before.

304
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:29,612
Where was it?

305
00:20:33,652 --> 00:20:36,932
Do you think
that white-haired monster can swim?

306
00:21:52,051 --> 00:21:52,972
It's so deep.

307
00:21:56,612 --> 00:21:58,251
This is a bottomless pit.

308
00:22:00,811 --> 00:22:02,731
Will there be monsters here?

309
00:22:03,091 --> 00:22:04,452
We're not in Journey to the West.

310
00:22:06,372 --> 00:22:07,212
Look.

311
00:22:08,932 --> 00:22:10,491
If we follow these stone steps down,

312
00:22:12,011 --> 00:22:13,331
there might be another path.

313
00:22:17,251 --> 00:22:18,291
Should we go check it out?

314
00:22:20,011 --> 00:22:20,452
Let's go.

315
00:22:22,612 --> 00:22:23,331
Pangzi.

316
00:22:23,852 --> 00:22:24,771
Wait a second.

317
00:22:25,132 --> 00:22:26,652
At least wait for the mist to clear.

318
00:22:26,652 --> 00:22:27,811
It's too dangerous right now.

319
00:22:29,972 --> 00:22:31,132
I'll be fine.

320
00:22:31,811 --> 00:22:33,412
I'm just going to scout ahead.

321
00:22:34,011 --> 00:22:36,692
If there's real danger,
I'll come back up.

322
00:22:37,852 --> 00:22:38,652
Relax.

323
00:22:39,331 --> 00:22:40,212
Come on.

324
00:22:40,811 --> 00:22:42,091
Be careful down there.

325
00:22:44,652 --> 00:22:45,612
It's really narrow.

326
00:22:57,972 --> 00:22:58,852
English letters here!

327
00:22:59,932 --> 00:23:01,051
You must be mistaken.

328
00:23:01,571 --> 00:23:03,372
Why would there be that
in the shipwreck?

329
00:23:04,531 --> 00:23:06,771
I might not know English well,

330
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,372
but I know the alphabet.

331
00:23:10,212 --> 00:23:11,491
This is clearly English.

332
00:23:11,571 --> 00:23:12,852
Come down and see for yourself.

333
00:23:13,652 --> 00:23:15,331
Read what it says then.

334
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,132
If I could read it,

335
00:23:21,132 --> 00:23:22,372
would I need you to come down?

336
00:23:22,731 --> 00:23:23,491
Enough talk.

337
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:24,291
Get down here.

338
00:23:25,132 --> 00:23:26,731
If this isn't English,

339
00:23:26,852 --> 00:23:28,291
I'll write my surname upside down.

340
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,452
Tell me loud and clear. Is it English?

341
00:23:42,132 --> 00:23:42,932
Is it?

342
00:23:42,932 --> 00:23:43,972
Yes, it is!

343
00:23:44,612 --> 00:23:45,811
I apologize, okay?

344
00:23:45,811 --> 00:23:47,051
That's more like it.

345
00:23:48,652 --> 00:23:50,892
Why are there English letters here?

346
00:23:53,491 --> 00:23:57,452
Could it be that some foreigners
came down here before?

347
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:00,011
Those foreigners!

348
00:24:00,412 --> 00:24:02,212
Always stealing our treasures!

349
00:24:03,051 --> 00:24:03,972
Not necessarily.

350
00:24:05,491 --> 00:24:07,011
Chinese people could write these too.

351
00:24:08,452 --> 00:24:09,531
My theory is that

352
00:24:09,892 --> 00:24:11,892
when the previous exploration team
came down,

353
00:24:12,212 --> 00:24:13,531
they encountered dangers

354
00:24:14,011 --> 00:24:14,932
and carved these

355
00:24:14,932 --> 00:24:16,291
English letters as a warning.

356
00:24:18,612 --> 00:24:20,571
Are you saying

357
00:24:20,811 --> 00:24:22,452
it might've been
your third uncle's team?

358
00:24:23,652 --> 00:24:24,811
That crossed my mind.

359
00:24:26,051 --> 00:24:26,771
But

360
00:24:28,531 --> 00:24:30,132
if the others came down here

361
00:24:30,132 --> 00:24:32,011
while my third uncle slept,

362
00:24:33,331 --> 00:24:34,531
could there be a connection

363
00:24:35,692 --> 00:24:37,892
between their disappearance
and this place?

364
00:24:41,811 --> 00:24:43,531
I think I've been here before.

365
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:51,531
Where's he going?

366
00:24:54,331 --> 00:24:55,132
What did he say?

367
00:24:56,652 --> 00:24:57,132
Xiaoge!

368
00:25:07,652 --> 00:25:08,412
Is he really

369
00:25:08,412 --> 00:25:10,491
that person from the old photo
20 years ago?

370
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:15,291
What did you say?

371
00:25:20,932 --> 00:25:21,892
You know what?

372
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,412
This place is pitch black.

373
00:25:24,972 --> 00:25:26,051
Earlier, Xiaoge and I

374
00:25:26,051 --> 00:25:28,212
nearly drowned underwater.

375
00:25:28,412 --> 00:25:29,051
We didn't notice

376
00:25:29,051 --> 00:25:31,212
the space below is so huge.

377
00:25:48,051 --> 00:25:48,852
Xiaoge?

378
00:25:51,372 --> 00:25:52,452
Why has he frozen there?

379
00:25:55,571 --> 00:25:56,372
Xiaoge?

380
00:26:41,652 --> 00:26:42,452
Xiaoge.

381
00:26:59,892 --> 00:27:01,972
What's this stone sculpture
supposed to be?

382
00:27:02,331 --> 00:27:03,972
Looks like some Hemudu tribesman.

383
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:06,291
It's a Sea-Calming Stone Monkey,

384
00:27:07,372 --> 00:27:09,728
usually sunk at pond bottoms
to ward off evil.

385
00:27:10,251 --> 00:27:11,452
It wards off evil?

386
00:27:11,892 --> 00:27:12,932
I should be thanking it

387
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:13,972
if it doesn't beat me.

388
00:27:52,412 --> 00:27:53,011
Sanxing!

389
00:27:53,331 --> 00:27:54,091
Stop running!

390
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:56,491
- (Sanxing!)
- (Sanxing!)

391
00:27:57,852 --> 00:27:58,688
Come back!

392
00:28:02,491 --> 00:28:03,251
(Absolutely not.)

393
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:05,172
(Sanxing's responsible
for our team's safety.)

394
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:06,132
(He says we can't go.)

395
00:28:06,612 --> 00:28:08,384
- Zhang!
- Zhang!

396
00:28:08,384 --> 00:28:09,452
- Zhang!
- Zhang!

397
00:28:09,452 --> 00:28:10,656
- Zhang!
- What are you doing?

398
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:12,132
- Come on, Zhang!
- We need to leave.

399
00:28:12,132 --> 00:28:12,896
