3
00:01:06,996 --> 00:01:07,596
Xiaoge.

4
00:01:08,555 --> 00:01:09,716
Does it

5
00:01:09,716 --> 00:01:10,876
remind you of anything?

6
00:01:16,563 --> 00:01:17,179
Hey.

7
00:01:17,236 --> 00:01:17,876
There's writing.

8
00:01:21,427 --> 00:01:28,992
(The fated shall see the Heavenly Gate.
Enter to obtain paradise.)

9
00:01:31,036 --> 00:01:32,236
What does it say

10
00:01:32,236 --> 00:01:33,115
down there?

11
00:01:34,356 --> 00:01:37,435
The owner of this shipwreck
built a heavenly palace.

12
00:01:38,275 --> 00:01:39,875
And the entrance to it

13
00:01:40,155 --> 00:01:41,595
is inside this stone stele.

14
00:01:41,756 --> 00:01:43,296
If you're the fated one,

15
00:01:43,296 --> 00:01:45,236
(Heavenly Gate)
you can enter heaven through it.

16
00:01:46,115 --> 00:01:47,435
For real?

17
00:01:51,435 --> 00:01:52,555
There is

18
00:01:53,076 --> 00:01:54,115
a gate here?

19
00:01:56,956 --> 00:01:59,555
These words sound like Zen teachings.

20
00:02:00,356 --> 00:02:02,316
But interpretations
vary among individuals.

21
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,476
The original meaning

22
00:02:04,715 --> 00:02:06,636
wasn't about a physical gate.

23
00:02:07,236 --> 00:02:08,835
It says this stone stele

24
00:02:10,115 --> 00:02:12,196
might conceal some hidden contents.

25
00:02:13,756 --> 00:02:14,636
Hidden contents?

26
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:17,196
This stele looks completely bare.

27
00:02:17,196 --> 00:02:18,196
What hidden contents

28
00:02:18,356 --> 00:02:19,476
can there be?

29
00:02:19,956 --> 00:02:21,316
You're not the fated one.

30
00:02:21,316 --> 00:02:22,476
So you don't see it.

31
00:02:23,196 --> 00:02:24,395
You brat.

32
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,155
Learned to mock me, huh?

33
00:02:27,715 --> 00:02:29,395
Your third uncle was fated.

34
00:02:29,715 --> 00:02:30,555
Well?

35
00:02:30,796 --> 00:02:31,916
Where is he now?

36
00:02:39,796 --> 00:02:40,636
Do you think

37
00:02:40,636 --> 00:02:42,595
maybe your third uncle

38
00:02:43,356 --> 00:02:45,236
was too fated with the Heavenly Gate

39
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:48,076
and has entered the heavenly palace?

40
00:03:00,316 --> 00:03:01,636
We're running out of time.

41
00:03:02,595 --> 00:03:04,275
We've stayed here too long.

42
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,516
We're certainly getting

43
00:03:07,076 --> 00:03:08,956
acquainted with this water.

44
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,715
Look how fast the water's rising.

45
00:03:12,115 --> 00:03:13,995
Soon we won't even make it out.

46
00:03:15,155 --> 00:03:17,395
Alright, I'll get Xiaoge.

47
00:03:23,675 --> 00:03:24,675
Where is he?

48
00:03:26,835 --> 00:03:28,076
Wasn't he just here?

49
00:03:29,996 --> 00:03:30,676
Xiaoge.

50
00:03:30,676 --> 00:03:31,475
Xiaoge!

51
00:03:32,395 --> 00:03:33,235
Xiaoge!

52
00:03:34,395 --> 00:03:35,076
Xiaoge.

53
00:03:35,956 --> 00:03:37,275
Always so elusive.

54
00:03:44,835 --> 00:03:45,636
Xiaoge.

55
00:03:56,795 --> 00:03:58,196
Why are you hiding here?

56
00:03:58,395 --> 00:03:59,316
Are you alright?

57
00:04:01,756 --> 00:04:02,756
I remembered

58
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:06,035
what happened 20 years ago.

59
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:09,116
♪Dear friends♪

60
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,155
♪Who owns this glorious spring♪

61
00:04:11,475 --> 00:04:14,275
♪You and me♪

62
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:17,795
♪The new generation of the 80s♪

63
00:04:25,676 --> 00:04:26,475
Check this out.

64
00:04:26,915 --> 00:04:28,556
The ballast stones look fishy.

65
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:29,835
What's wrong?

66
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:32,155
Look, there are patterns

67
00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:33,275
with inscriptions below.

68
00:04:33,636 --> 00:04:34,835
I know about this.

69
00:04:35,395 --> 00:04:37,915
It says the production site
of the ballast stone.

70
00:04:37,915 --> 00:04:38,756
Qi You.

71
00:04:38,756 --> 00:04:41,715
No, production site codes
aren't formatted this way.

72
00:04:42,235 --> 00:04:45,395
These characters
resemble the ballast stone patterns.

73
00:04:45,795 --> 00:04:47,795
It's probably the artist's first name.

74
00:04:48,316 --> 00:04:49,996
Ancient people valued their surnames.

75
00:04:49,996 --> 00:04:51,676
How could it be a first name?

76
00:04:51,676 --> 00:04:52,756
It makes even less sense.

77
00:04:52,756 --> 00:04:54,035
Look at this circle.

78
00:04:54,235 --> 00:04:55,076
The stroke order.

79
00:04:55,076 --> 00:04:55,475
Right?

80
00:04:55,475 --> 00:04:56,475
Whose name is it?

81
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:59,116
It doesn't matter whose name it is.

82
00:04:59,116 --> 00:05:00,715
It's someone's first name.

83
00:05:00,915 --> 00:05:04,436
Zhang, help me figure this out.

84
00:05:25,395 --> 00:05:26,996
These carved words

85
00:05:27,516 --> 00:05:29,756
are ordered based
on the ballast stones' layout.

86
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:32,475
They depict the construction
of a massive project.

87
00:05:33,275 --> 00:05:34,516
Massive project?

88
00:05:35,516 --> 00:05:36,636
What massive project?

89
00:05:38,368 --> 00:05:40,956
- Heavenly Palace on the Clouds.
- Heavenly Palace on the Clouds?

90
00:05:40,956 --> 00:05:41,676
What?

91
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:42,816
What did you say?

92
00:05:42,816 --> 00:05:44,076
He's referring to

93
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:45,876
the Heavenly Palace on the Clouds

94
00:05:45,876 --> 00:05:47,316
built by ghost hand Wang Zanghai.

95
00:05:47,316 --> 00:05:48,676
Yeah, I've heard of it.

96
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:49,795
Is this real?

97
00:05:50,996 --> 00:05:53,155
They say that Wang Zanghai

98
00:05:53,155 --> 00:05:55,235
used giant kites with vast amounts

99
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:56,956
of golden threads

100
00:05:57,196 --> 00:05:58,956
to create an illusion of a magnificent

101
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:02,076
floating palace to please the emperor.

102
00:06:02,436 --> 00:06:04,876
If these ballast stones
document history,

103
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:07,275
that would be a major discovery.

104
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,768
- Really?
- Really?

105
00:06:09,856 --> 00:06:10,676
I'm going in.

106
00:06:10,676 --> 00:06:11,915
There will be more clues.

107
00:06:12,475 --> 00:06:13,395
Fantastic.

108
00:06:15,035 --> 00:06:16,516
No way, Zhang.

109
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:17,876
No way.

110
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,556
We've lost one person.

111
00:06:20,636 --> 00:06:22,636
We can't afford any more mistakes.

112
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,316
Let go.

113
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:28,956
Thank you.

114
00:06:29,275 --> 00:06:29,956
Zhang.

115
00:06:35,556 --> 00:06:37,116
Let's just follow him.

116
00:06:37,116 --> 00:06:39,316
It's the Heavenly Palace on the Clouds.

117
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,436
Aren't you curious?

118
00:06:40,676 --> 00:06:42,436
Of course, we are.

119
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,676
I say we go together

120
00:06:44,715 --> 00:06:45,915
to watch each other's backs.

121
00:06:46,076 --> 00:06:47,316
Alright, let's go.

122
00:06:47,316 --> 00:06:48,556
- Let's go.
- Go.

123
00:06:48,956 --> 00:06:49,395
Let's go.

124
00:06:51,475 --> 00:06:52,275
Alright then.

125
00:06:53,756 --> 00:06:55,275
He's still sleeping.

126
00:06:55,275 --> 00:06:56,316
Should we wake him up?

127
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:58,196
No, he's got a temper.

128
00:06:58,355 --> 00:07:00,475
He'll fight with Zhang if we wake him.

129
00:07:01,235 --> 00:07:02,516
Right. Good point.

130
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:04,876
So, let's go.

131
00:07:05,316 --> 00:07:06,076
- Let's go.
- Go.

132
00:07:06,076 --> 00:07:06,516
Let's go.

133
00:07:07,756 --> 00:07:08,795
Let's take a look

134
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:09,915
and get out fast.

135
00:07:10,116 --> 00:07:11,556
But no one

136
00:07:11,756 --> 00:07:13,316
should touch anything inside.

137
00:07:13,436 --> 00:07:15,795
- No problem. Let's go.
- Alright.

138
00:07:55,196 --> 00:07:56,076
Zhang.

139
00:08:12,436 --> 00:08:13,355
What's that?

140
00:08:13,556 --> 00:08:14,475
Where?

141
00:08:14,475 --> 00:08:14,995
There.

142
00:08:15,635 --> 00:08:16,556
It's blurry.

143
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:18,835
Keep going.

144
00:08:18,835 --> 00:08:19,276
Let's go.

145
00:09:05,676 --> 00:09:06,755
Check this out.

146
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:14,835
The fated shall see the Heavenly Gate.

147
00:09:15,115 --> 00:09:18,355
Enter to obtain paradise.

148
00:09:19,635 --> 00:09:21,635
The heavenly palace is real?

149
00:09:22,475 --> 00:09:24,036
(Heavenly Gate)
This is unbelievable.

150
00:09:24,036 --> 00:09:24,796
Indeed.

151
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,835
It's time.

152
00:09:32,715 --> 00:09:33,835
We should head back.

153
00:09:35,355 --> 00:09:35,936
Let's go.

154
00:09:35,936 --> 00:09:37,115
- Okay.
- Okay.

155
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:40,835
Careful.

156
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:48,556
Wait.

157
00:09:49,396 --> 00:09:50,156
Where's Zhang?

158
00:09:51,755 --> 00:09:52,556
Right.

159
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:54,396
Zhang!

160
00:09:55,515 --> 00:09:56,835
Let's go, Zhang!

161
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:58,036
- Zhang, stop looking!
- Zhang, stop looking!

162
00:09:58,036 --> 00:09:58,515
Let's go!

163
00:09:58,515 --> 00:09:59,436
Come on, Zhang!

164
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:02,595
Zhang.

165
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:05,156
Zhang.

166
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:08,835
Zhang, we need to leave.

167
00:10:08,835 --> 00:10:09,835
What are you doing?

168
00:10:11,316 --> 00:10:12,196
Zhang?

169
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:27,835
- Wenjin!
- Wenjin!

170
00:10:30,715 --> 00:10:31,276
Where is she?

171
00:10:32,796 --> 00:10:33,755
Do you think

172
00:10:34,115 --> 00:10:36,515
there could be ghosts down there?

173
00:10:36,835 --> 00:10:37,676
Don't talk nonsense.

174
00:10:38,036 --> 00:10:39,235
There is no such thing.

175
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:40,436
I'll check.

176
00:10:41,235 --> 00:10:43,076
Huo Ling, don't.

177
00:10:43,156 --> 00:10:43,835
Huo Ling.

178
00:10:43,956 --> 00:10:44,995
Be careful.

179
00:10:53,036 --> 00:10:53,956
Wenjin.

180
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:56,715
Wenjin.

181
00:10:59,556 --> 00:11:00,475
Wenjin.

182
00:11:05,515 --> 00:11:07,835
Zhang, what are you doing here?

183
00:11:09,715 --> 00:11:11,995
Zhang, why are you spacing out?

184
00:11:11,995 --> 00:11:12,875
We're all waiting.

185
00:11:17,024 --> 00:11:18,720
Hey! Hey!

186
00:11:22,796 --> 00:11:23,755
Sanxing.

187
00:11:27,755 --> 00:11:28,556
Sanxing!

188
00:11:29,235 --> 00:11:30,432
- Sanxing.
- Sanxing!

189
00:11:30,752 --> 00:11:31,796
Why is Sanxing here?

190
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,208
Sanxing.

191
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:37,152
- Sanxing!
- Sanxing, what's wrong?

192
00:11:37,152 --> 00:11:38,624
What are you doing, Sanxing?

193
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,076
- Sanxing, stop!
- Sanxing, stop running.

194
00:11:40,076 --> 00:11:40,875
- Stop!
- Sanxing.

195
00:11:41,036 --> 00:11:42,156
Sanxing, what are you doing?

196
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:44,676
Sanxing!

197
00:11:45,196 --> 00:11:46,115
Sanxing, stop running!

198
00:11:47,595 --> 00:11:48,276
Stop running.

199
00:11:49,755 --> 00:11:50,676
Sanxing, stop!

200
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:52,595
Stop there!

201
00:11:52,768 --> 00:11:53,792
Hey! Sanxing!

202
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:54,784
- Sanxing!
- Sanxing!

203
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,936
Stop!

204
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:57,920
- Sanxing!
- Sanxing!

205
00:12:00,835 --> 00:12:01,515
Where is he?

206
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:03,556
Where is he?

207
00:12:11,316 --> 00:12:12,595
Sanxing is gone.

208
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,016
(The fated shall see the Heavenly Gate.
Enter to obtain paradise.)

209
00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:36,956
Eight hidden doors.

210
00:13:37,835 --> 00:13:39,036
This is the Esoteric Arts.

211
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:43,796
Opening Gate.

212
00:13:44,796 --> 00:13:46,156
Rest Gate.

213
00:13:46,635 --> 00:13:47,835
Life Gate.

214
00:13:48,676 --> 00:13:49,475
Death Gate.

215
00:13:50,995 --> 00:13:51,676
Obstruction Gate.

216
00:13:53,036 --> 00:13:53,875
Scenery Gate.

217
00:13:55,316 --> 00:13:56,115
Injury Gate.

218
00:13:57,156 --> 00:13:57,835
Fear Gate.

219
00:14:00,196 --> 00:14:01,475
The Life Gate offers survival.

220
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,076
The Death Gate brings doom.

221
00:14:05,115 --> 00:14:06,556
Entering other gates

222
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:08,676
will endlessly loop

223
00:14:09,635 --> 00:14:10,715
the eight gates.

224
00:14:17,115 --> 00:14:18,715
Huo Ling, don't.

225
00:14:19,115 --> 00:14:20,355
If we choose wrong,

226
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:24,355
we might be trapped forever.

227
00:14:25,316 --> 00:14:26,796
Or even die in there.

228
00:14:32,276 --> 00:14:33,796
Which gate did Sanxing take?

229
00:14:34,676 --> 00:14:35,916
I'm not sure.

230
00:14:38,036 --> 00:14:39,995
He was acting so strange,

231
00:14:40,436 --> 00:14:42,076
as if a female ghost possessed him.

232
00:14:53,355 --> 00:14:55,316
Zhang, what are you doing?

233
00:15:13,316 --> 00:15:15,115
If there's truly a female ghost here,

234
00:15:16,276 --> 00:15:17,475
then this ghost

235
00:15:18,076 --> 00:15:20,036
might be the owner of this tomb.

236
00:15:22,595 --> 00:15:23,835
In that case,

237
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,276
the gate Sanxing entered

238
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,276
could be the Life Gate.

239
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:34,875
Sanxing was combing his hair here?

240
00:15:35,515 --> 00:15:37,396
A guy combing his hair?

241
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,676
Didn't Wenjin say he was possessed

242
00:15:39,676 --> 00:15:40,835
by a female ghost?

243
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:42,036
A female ghost?

244
00:15:42,036 --> 00:15:42,715
Nonsense.

245
00:15:43,956 --> 00:15:46,156
He must've seen something inside

246
00:15:46,755 --> 00:15:48,715
and had to comb his hair to see clearly.

247
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:49,316
Combing hair?

248
00:15:51,396 --> 00:15:52,235
Like this?

249
00:15:53,396 --> 00:15:54,156
Lower your head.

250
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:57,196
Tilt sideways.

251
00:15:57,715 --> 00:15:58,835
I don't see anything.

252
00:15:58,956 --> 00:16:00,036
Turn your face slightly.

253
00:16:00,755 --> 00:16:01,715
Is the posture wrong?

254
00:16:01,715 --> 00:16:03,036
Try lowering your chin.

255
00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:04,755
What's going on?

256
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:05,916
What am I doing wrong?

257
00:16:07,475 --> 00:16:09,036
He was more feminine than you.

258
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:46,196
Sanxing.

259
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:50,755
Wu Sanxing.

260
00:17:55,995 --> 00:17:58,116
If he's truly possessed,

261
00:17:58,315 --> 00:18:00,156
following him could be dangerous.

262
00:18:06,515 --> 00:18:07,715
I'll look for him alone.

263
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:08,755
Head back and wait.

264
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:11,156
If I don't return in half an hour,

265
00:18:11,636 --> 00:18:12,876
send reinforcements.

266
00:18:13,035 --> 00:18:13,436
But...

267
00:18:13,436 --> 00:18:14,636
How can we do that?

268
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,196
We won't abandon you here.

269
00:18:16,315 --> 00:18:17,555
- Yes.
- Yes.

270
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:18,475
I'll go with you.

271
00:18:19,715 --> 00:18:20,676
Me, too.

272
00:18:20,836 --> 00:18:21,676
Me, too.

273
00:18:22,515 --> 00:18:24,596
It's too dangerous. Let's all stay.

274
00:18:24,596 --> 00:18:25,156
Let's go.

275
00:18:25,156 --> 00:18:26,396
What's so dangerous?

276
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,315
But what if...

277
00:18:27,475 --> 00:18:28,555
No "what ifs".

278
00:18:28,555 --> 00:18:29,156
We're all here.

279
00:18:29,636 --> 00:18:31,035
There's nothing scary.

280
00:18:31,035 --> 00:18:31,995
We have Chen Wenjin.

281
00:18:31,995 --> 00:18:32,836
Don't be afraid.

282
00:18:34,995 --> 00:18:37,596
Do you smell fragrance?

283
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:39,356
Yeah.

284
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:41,275
And it's growing stronger.

285
00:18:41,275 --> 00:18:41,795
Wenjin.

286
00:19:37,715 --> 00:19:38,876
(When I woke up,)

287
00:19:39,436 --> 00:19:41,715
(I found myself in a hospital bed.)

288
00:19:42,475 --> 00:19:43,636
(No memories.)

289
00:19:44,035 --> 00:19:45,075
(Utterly clueless.)

290
00:19:50,275 --> 00:19:51,755
(Months later,)

291
00:19:52,116 --> 00:19:54,396
(scattered memories resurfaced.)

292
00:20:00,196 --> 00:20:02,995
(I remembered Chen Wenjin,
Huo Ling, and the others,)

293
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,876
(but no concrete details.)

294
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,075
What I can say is that

295
00:20:23,396 --> 00:20:24,555
for twenty years,

296
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,596
I've been trying to find them.

297
00:20:26,836 --> 00:20:28,075
No clues surfaced.

298
00:20:29,035 --> 00:20:31,916
Three months ago,
I met your third uncle.

299
00:20:32,755 --> 00:20:34,196
He looked familiar.

300
00:20:34,876 --> 00:20:35,715
After that,

301
00:20:35,995 --> 00:20:37,396
I joined your kiln expedition.

302
00:20:38,156 --> 00:20:39,116
There, I realized

303
00:20:40,196 --> 00:20:41,436
he was hiding something.

304
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:47,715
King Shang of Lu
and the silk manuscript were fake.

305
00:20:48,075 --> 00:20:49,396
Your third uncle swapped it out.

306
00:20:49,755 --> 00:20:50,436
Nonsense.

307
00:20:50,755 --> 00:20:52,035
Xiaoge

308
00:20:52,596 --> 00:20:53,876
could've easily

309
00:20:54,596 --> 00:20:55,795
killed that blood corpse,

310
00:20:55,795 --> 00:20:56,956
so why did he keep running

311
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:58,116
and running?

312
00:20:58,475 --> 00:20:59,636
He was trying

313
00:20:59,836 --> 00:21:01,356
to ditch us.

314
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:03,436
You swapped it.

315
00:21:04,035 --> 00:21:04,795
No, I didn't.

316
00:21:05,436 --> 00:21:06,596
Your third uncle did it.

317
00:21:07,356 --> 00:21:09,475
He and Da Kui dug their way up
from under the tree.

318
00:21:09,755 --> 00:21:10,755
Maybe he dug

319
00:21:10,755 --> 00:21:12,475
behind the tree

320
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:15,356
straight to the coffin's base.

321
00:21:20,436 --> 00:21:21,116
Da Kui!

322
00:21:21,116 --> 00:21:21,795
Maybe

323
00:21:21,795 --> 00:21:23,916
that's why Da Kui had to die.

324
00:21:26,116 --> 00:21:27,275
Da Kui!

325
00:21:28,795 --> 00:21:30,396
(Throughout this journey,)

326
00:21:30,396 --> 00:21:31,936
(Sanxing's contributions to the team)

327
00:21:31,936 --> 00:21:33,856
(were far more crucial
than my role as captain.)

328
00:21:34,396 --> 00:21:35,515
(Yet regarding Sanxing,)

329
00:21:35,515 --> 00:21:36,956
(I sometimes feel)

330
00:21:36,956 --> 00:21:38,275
(he is so enigmatic.)

331
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:40,916
No.

332
00:21:41,436 --> 00:21:42,555
This doesn't add up.

333
00:21:42,555 --> 00:21:44,836
Third Uncle has no motive.

334
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,396
Why would he do this?

335
00:21:47,995 --> 00:21:49,475
If he's truly your third uncle,

336
00:21:49,795 --> 00:21:50,956
then he has no motive.

337
00:21:52,636 --> 00:21:53,315
But...

338
00:21:58,356 --> 00:21:58,995
Third Uncle.

339
00:21:59,116 --> 00:22:00,275
Take me with you.

340
00:22:00,515 --> 00:22:02,715
I've read Grandpa's notebook
so many times.

341
00:22:02,715 --> 00:22:03,676
I'm so curious.

342
00:22:03,836 --> 00:22:04,956
Call your dad first.

343
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,715
If he approves, I'll take you.

344
00:22:06,995 --> 00:22:08,995
Let's see if he'll break your legs.

345
00:22:09,315 --> 00:22:10,560
How will you walk without legs?

346
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,156
Come on. Want me to call him?

347
00:22:13,275 --> 00:22:14,715
As a Wu,

348
00:22:14,715 --> 00:22:16,356
you gave up so easily?

349
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,196
Seems like

350
00:22:18,196 --> 00:22:20,475
you didn't really want to go anyway.

351
00:22:21,116 --> 00:22:22,156
You'll take me?

352
00:22:22,356 --> 00:22:24,235
You'll follow my lead.

353
00:22:44,275 --> 00:22:45,636
Truth is, many people

354
00:22:45,636 --> 00:22:48,676
in this world are clueless
about who they are.

355
00:22:50,876 --> 00:22:51,515
Have you ever

356
00:22:51,596 --> 00:22:53,396
thought that you might not be Wu Xie?

357
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:58,555
This is too complicated.

358
00:22:59,356 --> 00:23:01,916
Too many unanswered questions.

359
00:23:05,555 --> 00:23:08,116
I can't verify anything
when Third Uncle is missing.

360
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:10,396
The top priority

361
00:23:10,396 --> 00:23:11,836
is to find our way out.

362
00:23:13,035 --> 00:23:14,035
Once I'm out,

363
00:23:14,156 --> 00:23:16,235
I'll get to the bottom of this.

364
00:23:16,235 --> 00:23:20,436
♪Su San leaves Hongtong County♪

365
00:23:21,035 --> 00:23:24,515
♪Appearing on the bustling street♪

366
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:26,356
Pangzi.

367
00:23:26,475 --> 00:23:27,596
What's your problem?

368
00:23:27,596 --> 00:23:28,596
Be quiet, okay?

369
00:23:28,636 --> 00:23:32,196
I am combing my hair.

370
00:23:32,196 --> 00:23:34,475
Why do you care?

371
00:23:34,475 --> 00:23:35,836
Cut the yapping.

372
00:23:35,836 --> 00:23:38,596
You want to visit
that heavenly palace, too?

373
00:23:40,315 --> 00:23:42,156
Let me ask you one thing.

374
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:46,035
After all our time here,

375
00:23:46,156 --> 00:23:48,356
have you found the path
to the top of the ship?

376
00:23:49,075 --> 00:23:51,315
I have.

377
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:53,515
It's hidden in this inscription.

378
00:23:54,876 --> 00:23:57,636
The fated shall see

379
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,235
the Heavenly Gate.

380
00:23:59,235 --> 00:24:00,035
Enter

381
00:24:00,035 --> 00:24:01,995
to obtain paradise.

382
00:24:05,356 --> 00:24:06,676
What's paradise?

383
00:24:08,075 --> 00:24:10,555
That heavenly palace counts as paradise.

384
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:15,156
But it can't be underground.

385
00:24:16,515 --> 00:24:18,515
Thus, I conclude

386
00:24:18,515 --> 00:24:22,396
it's near the ship's highest point.

387
00:24:27,436 --> 00:24:29,755
You have a good point this time.

388
00:24:29,995 --> 00:24:32,956
I've always had a good point.

389
00:24:35,196 --> 00:24:36,916
To reach the heavenly palace,

390
00:24:37,515 --> 00:24:39,315
we must find the Life Gate first,

391
00:24:40,596 --> 00:24:42,436
which requires us to comb our hair.

392
00:24:46,075 --> 00:24:47,275
Xiaoge.

393
00:24:47,396 --> 00:24:49,315
You've been here before.

394
00:24:49,315 --> 00:24:51,275
Do you remember which door it was?

395
00:24:59,035 --> 00:25:00,035
This one.

396
00:25:02,396 --> 00:25:03,196
Don't enter yet.

397
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:08,156
The Esoteric Arts work like elevators.

398
00:25:11,275 --> 00:25:12,596
You're saying

399
00:25:13,315 --> 00:25:16,475
that the eight doors shift randomly

400
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:19,196
like a revolving restaurant.

401
00:25:21,035 --> 00:25:23,315
So the central stele

402
00:25:23,676 --> 00:25:24,876
must house a mechanism

403
00:25:24,876 --> 00:25:27,436
synchronized with the wall rotation.

404
00:25:28,475 --> 00:25:30,836
The mark's position corresponds

405
00:25:31,235 --> 00:25:33,156
to the so-called Heavenly Gate.

406
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:11,755
(Third Uncle.)

407
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:14,836
(What happened back then?)

408
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:07,755
What did you just see?

409
00:27:08,555 --> 00:27:09,436
I was combing my hair.

410
00:27:09,436 --> 00:27:10,795
Why didn't I see anything?

411
00:27:11,275 --> 00:27:13,475
Three fish connected head-to-tail.

412
00:27:14,275 --> 00:27:15,235
What fish?

413
00:27:23,836 --> 00:27:26,555
You think this pitch-black tunnel

414
00:27:27,275 --> 00:27:28,916
leads all the way to shore?

415
00:27:31,936 --> 00:27:33,196
Snake-Eyebrow Copper Fish.

416
00:27:39,596 --> 00:27:40,515
Your Third Uncle

417
00:27:40,515 --> 00:27:42,275
found these
in that dead teammate's hand?

418
00:27:44,636 --> 00:27:46,156
Why are there two of them?

419
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,636
Do you have to be so stingy?

420
00:27:49,596 --> 00:27:50,676
The King of Lu's kiln.

421
00:27:51,356 --> 00:27:52,156
We took a box

422
00:27:52,156 --> 00:27:53,515
from the Green-Eyed Fox Corpse

423
00:27:53,515 --> 00:27:54,995
back there, remember?

424
00:27:55,116 --> 00:27:56,555
The same one you hit me with.

425
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:58,676
Yeah.

426
00:28:00,755 --> 00:28:01,836
You brat.

427
00:28:02,196 --> 00:28:03,196
Why didn't you tell me

428
00:28:03,196 --> 00:28:04,075
you opened that box?

429
00:28:04,396 --> 00:28:06,396
This fish might be some kind of key.

430
00:28:06,396 --> 00:28:08,596
Had I known it was a key,
I would've taken it out.

431
00:28:09,156 --> 00:28:10,315
It was a mess back there.

432
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:11,515
How could I remember that?

433
00:28:11,836 --> 00:28:12,676
Fine.

434
00:28:12,916 --> 00:28:13,636
I'll let it slide.

435
00:28:16,676 --> 00:28:19,755
This shipwreck is so far
from the King of Lu's kiln.

436
00:28:20,715 --> 00:28:22,436
But let's put it aside.

437
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,876
They're over 1000 years apart in age.

438
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,916
That's what I thought, too.

439
00:28:28,795 --> 00:28:29,636
But remember

440
00:28:29,636 --> 00:28:31,315
the mechanisms at the King of Lu's kiln?

441
00:28:32,156 --> 00:28:33,396
Even then, I felt

442
00:28:33,515 --> 00:28:35,275
their craftsmanship
was too sophisticated

443
00:28:35,275 --> 00:28:37,596
for people dating back 1000 years.

444
00:28:38,436 --> 00:28:39,275
Now it seems

445
00:28:39,275 --> 00:28:41,075
that master craftsman Wang Zanghai

446
00:28:41,235 --> 00:28:42,636
may have visited the kiln

447
00:28:43,156 --> 00:28:44,836
and modified its mechanisms.

448
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:45,916
He might have put

449
00:28:45,916 --> 00:28:47,515
the Snake-Eyebrow Copper Fishes there.

450
00:28:48,356 --> 00:28:49,436
Judging by the fish pattern

451
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,515
on the gate,

452
00:28:50,715 --> 00:28:53,116
there should be
a third Snake-Eyebrow Copper Fish.

453
00:28:54,436 --> 00:28:55,755
A third one?

454
00:28:57,555 --> 00:28:59,116
What does the fish stand for?

455
00:29:02,275 --> 00:29:03,116
What are you doing?

456
00:29:03,715 --> 00:29:04,596
Let's go.

457
00:29:05,676 --> 00:29:06,876
What's wrong?

458
00:29:08,235 --> 00:29:09,075
Pangzi.

459
00:29:10,275 --> 00:29:11,235
These walls

460
00:29:11,436 --> 00:29:12,515
are closing in.

461
00:29:18,475 --> 00:29:19,275
Really.

462
00:29:25,436 --> 00:29:26,196
We're out of time.

463
00:29:26,356 --> 00:29:27,035
Run.

464
00:29:28,876 --> 00:29:29,676
Run!

465
00:29:31,676 --> 00:29:32,555
Wait for me.

466
00:29:37,436 --> 00:29:38,515
Hurry, Pangzi.

467
00:29:40,995 --> 00:29:42,315
Slow down, you two.

468
00:29:42,636 --> 00:29:43,636
