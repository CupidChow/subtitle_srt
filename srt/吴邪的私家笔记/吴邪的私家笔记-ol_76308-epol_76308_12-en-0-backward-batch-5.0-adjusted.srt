00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:08,116
Pangzi?

4
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:10,635
Pangzi?

5
00:02:13,556 --> 00:02:15,076
Where am I?

6
00:02:15,516 --> 00:02:17,635
Paradise or netherworld?

7
00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:23,195
Wu, something's off.

8
00:02:24,516 --> 00:02:26,956
These arrows feel strange.

9
00:02:27,836 --> 00:02:29,315
It doesn't hurt much.

10
00:02:29,956 --> 00:02:31,996
But why can't I move?

11
00:02:33,035 --> 00:02:34,516
Pull out a couple for me.

12
00:02:35,076 --> 00:02:36,475
Let me check the feeling.

13
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:57,396
Go ahead.

14
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,396
It's fine.

15
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:18,875
It's you.

16
00:03:30,315 --> 00:03:31,475
You're still alive?

17
00:03:32,556 --> 00:03:33,796
You look familiar.

18
00:03:34,396 --> 00:03:35,676
Xiaoge?

19
00:03:39,315 --> 00:03:40,755
Impressive, Xiaoge.

20
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,715
Your acting was top-notch.

21
00:03:45,836 --> 00:03:46,595
(Third Uncle,)

22
00:03:46,715 --> 00:03:48,236
(this person looks like Xiaoge.)

23
00:03:52,396 --> 00:03:54,236
This can't be the same person, right?

24
00:04:02,236 --> 00:04:03,195
Have you

25
00:04:03,836 --> 00:04:05,836
been here before?

26
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:09,796
Who are you?

27
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,595
Why did you...

28
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:12,676
That woman deliberately stepped earlier.

29
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:15,716
Seems she's not only
confident in herself,

30
00:04:16,596 --> 00:04:18,195
but also wants to eliminate all of us.

31
00:04:19,315 --> 00:04:20,596
Do you think

32
00:04:21,275 --> 00:04:22,435
it counts as fraud?

33
00:04:26,635 --> 00:04:27,476
Are you okay?

34
00:04:30,635 --> 00:04:32,236
You look pale.

35
00:04:38,676 --> 00:04:40,395
People like us

36
00:04:40,996 --> 00:04:42,596
get fooled often.

37
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,556
You'll get used to it.

38
00:04:44,835 --> 00:04:45,676
Well,

39
00:04:46,156 --> 00:04:47,236
I was thinking,

40
00:04:48,635 --> 00:04:49,996
if she was just using us

41
00:04:49,996 --> 00:04:51,156
to get into this shipwreck,

42
00:04:51,796 --> 00:04:53,875
is my third uncle's situation even real?

43
00:04:54,356 --> 00:04:55,315
Did my third uncle

44
00:04:55,476 --> 00:04:56,635
come down here or not?

45
00:04:56,635 --> 00:04:58,556
Or has he already died here?

46
00:04:58,556 --> 00:04:59,195
I...

47
00:05:00,356 --> 00:05:01,195
Here's the thing.

48
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:04,716
Did you see any traces
of your third uncle earlier?

49
00:05:07,116 --> 00:05:08,075
I can't be sure.

50
00:05:09,036 --> 00:05:10,476
Everything happened too quickly.

51
00:05:10,635 --> 00:05:12,476
Can you confirm he's alive?

52
00:05:13,996 --> 00:05:15,156
He should be.

53
00:05:15,476 --> 00:05:17,275
Can you pay the remaining fee then?

54
00:05:20,315 --> 00:05:21,395
Just kidding.

55
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,955
Do I look like someone
who'd abandon friends?

56
00:05:24,556 --> 00:05:25,996
Listen to me.

57
00:05:26,716 --> 00:05:27,996
The current situation

58
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:29,116
is complicated.

59
00:05:29,435 --> 00:05:30,116
Right?

60
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,556
Finding your third uncle is crucial,

61
00:05:32,556 --> 00:05:34,315
but let's stay alive first.

62
00:05:36,116 --> 00:05:36,996
So,

63
00:05:37,596 --> 00:05:39,635
stick with us later.

64
00:05:39,635 --> 00:05:41,755
If you spot any traces
of your third uncle,

65
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:42,676
just speak up.

66
00:05:43,395 --> 00:05:45,435
We'll decide then.

67
00:05:47,356 --> 00:05:48,156
Okay?

68
00:05:53,635 --> 00:05:54,476
Okay.

69
00:05:54,476 --> 00:05:55,315
Perfect.

70
00:05:55,596 --> 00:05:56,195
I get it now.

71
00:05:56,195 --> 00:05:58,476
So the most important thing now

72
00:05:59,195 --> 00:06:02,395
is whether you can help me
pull out these thorns first.

73
00:06:02,556 --> 00:06:04,635
I'm completely numbed by them.

74
00:06:05,476 --> 00:06:06,236
Come on.

75
00:06:06,435 --> 00:06:08,075
Start with this one.

76
00:06:09,515 --> 00:06:11,195
I haven't finished yet.

77
00:06:12,515 --> 00:06:14,796
Will rapid pulling leave scars?

78
00:06:23,036 --> 00:06:25,476
But why use such arrowheads?

79
00:06:26,716 --> 00:06:27,916
What are these?

80
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:30,116
Lotus arrows.

81
00:06:31,036 --> 00:06:32,395
How do you know?

82
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,955
I don't know their purpose.

83
00:06:38,395 --> 00:06:39,275
But seeing you shot,

84
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:40,755
I recognized them as lotus arrows.

85
00:06:42,156 --> 00:06:43,556
I can't think of an explanation.

86
00:06:44,476 --> 00:06:46,236
Maybe the shipwreck's owner

87
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,116
wanted to spare us,

88
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,476
making us retreat from danger.

89
00:06:50,356 --> 00:06:51,796
Does this make sense?

90
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,596
No time for speculation now.

91
00:06:55,755 --> 00:06:56,875
I've been thinking.

92
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,275
If Ning is using me,

93
00:06:58,556 --> 00:06:59,875
she must have other motives.

94
00:07:00,716 --> 00:07:02,195
I saw her go through this door.

95
00:07:02,195 --> 00:07:03,116
We should go

96
00:07:03,116 --> 00:07:04,036
and capture her

97
00:07:04,195 --> 00:07:06,236
to ask about my third uncle's situation.

98
00:07:07,156 --> 00:07:08,676
The thing in the ballast stone earlier

99
00:07:08,835 --> 00:07:10,435
told us to enter the left room first.

100
00:07:10,435 --> 00:07:11,716
There must be a reason.

101
00:07:11,955 --> 00:07:13,356
Let's follow the procedure.

102
00:07:13,356 --> 00:07:14,356
Stay put.

103
00:07:14,796 --> 00:07:15,716
Don't wander around.

104
00:07:15,716 --> 00:07:16,356
Well,

105
00:07:16,755 --> 00:07:18,236
if we don't grab her now,

106
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:19,356
once she gets out,

107
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:20,835
we won't know where to find her.

108
00:07:20,835 --> 00:07:22,036
Alright.

109
00:07:22,515 --> 00:07:23,556
Stop arguing.

110
00:07:23,755 --> 00:07:25,036
Listen to me.

111
00:07:25,036 --> 00:07:26,796
Let's return to the previous room

112
00:07:27,556 --> 00:07:28,755
and hide

113
00:07:28,755 --> 00:07:30,036
all the air tanks.

114
00:07:30,596 --> 00:07:33,036
Without them, that girl can't possibly

115
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,596
swim all the way back to the ship.

116
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:38,875
Enough talk.

117
00:07:41,116 --> 00:07:41,996
Help me.

118
00:07:44,676 --> 00:07:45,796
Remove these arrows first.

119
00:07:51,195 --> 00:07:52,476
When I catch that girl,

120
00:07:52,476 --> 00:07:54,275
I'll turn her into a pincushion.

121
00:08:01,835 --> 00:08:02,676
Where's our gear?

122
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:08,996
Where are the air tanks?

123
00:08:09,635 --> 00:08:10,916
The air tanks are gone.

124
00:08:11,395 --> 00:08:13,596
But I definitely moved them here myself.

125
00:08:24,996 --> 00:08:26,635
Without the diving equipment,

126
00:08:28,035 --> 00:08:29,836
we'll be trapped here forever.

127
00:08:29,836 --> 00:08:30,875
Does it mean

128
00:08:32,035 --> 00:08:33,196
there's someone else

129
00:08:33,836 --> 00:08:34,716
in here?

130
00:08:36,836 --> 00:08:37,875
Or something

131
00:08:39,076 --> 00:08:40,076
not human?

132
00:08:40,515 --> 00:08:41,275
Search the area.

133
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:42,076
Okay.

134
00:08:46,996 --> 00:08:48,275
Where did everything go?

135
00:09:01,076 --> 00:09:02,476
Did we enter the wrong room?

136
00:09:03,196 --> 00:09:04,395
Let's check outside.

137
00:09:04,596 --> 00:09:05,395
Let's go.

138
00:09:19,196 --> 00:09:20,515
Told you we came the right way.

139
00:09:23,316 --> 00:09:24,596
Let me retrace.

140
00:09:24,956 --> 00:09:26,596
We emerged from that pool,

141
00:09:26,596 --> 00:09:27,755
got shot by arrows,

142
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:28,675
and retreated back.

143
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,915
That's right. There was only one path.

144
00:09:33,515 --> 00:09:34,436
I see!

145
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:36,316
That scheming girl

146
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:38,716
must have dumped our equipment
into the pool!

147
00:09:57,275 --> 00:09:58,275
Wait, Pangzi.

148
00:09:59,675 --> 00:10:00,795
Something's wrong here.

149
00:10:11,956 --> 00:10:12,956
Xiaoge,

150
00:10:13,555 --> 00:10:14,915
you noticed earlier, didn't you?

151
00:10:15,356 --> 00:10:17,196
There wasn't this pillar here before.

152
00:10:17,356 --> 00:10:19,515
I found the room changed
since we entered.

153
00:10:19,675 --> 00:10:21,236
You weren't paying attention.

154
00:10:21,596 --> 00:10:22,875
This jar wasn't here either.

155
00:10:23,316 --> 00:10:24,956
The ballast stones' layout is changed.

156
00:10:25,555 --> 00:10:26,915
It's as if we're in another room.

157
00:10:27,395 --> 00:10:28,116
And

158
00:10:29,116 --> 00:10:30,076
look up.

159
00:10:35,116 --> 00:10:36,155
What the heck?

160
00:10:40,035 --> 00:10:41,196
This isn't just

161
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,915
one intruder anymore.

162
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:47,515
A whole renovation crew came here.

163
00:10:50,196 --> 00:10:51,116
We don't seem

164
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:53,076
to be in the same place anymore.

165
00:10:55,395 --> 00:10:56,875
This is a new space.

166
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,155
An entirely different location.

167
00:11:00,996 --> 00:11:02,316
What are you doing?

168
00:11:02,316 --> 00:11:03,875
Say something.

169
00:11:04,116 --> 00:11:06,275
Why are you just standing there
spacing out?

170
00:11:07,076 --> 00:11:09,035
If we can't find our gear,

171
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,395
we're stuck here.

172
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:11,675
Think of a solution.

173
00:11:11,675 --> 00:11:12,196
Hold on.

174
00:11:12,196 --> 00:11:13,196
We're trapped.

175
00:11:13,196 --> 00:11:14,275
Give me a minute.

176
00:11:15,755 --> 00:11:17,356
My third uncle came here back then.

177
00:11:17,515 --> 00:11:18,795
Let me try to remember.

178
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:20,116
Your third uncle was here?

179
00:11:20,116 --> 00:11:20,875
Why didn't you

180
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,155
mention this sooner?

181
00:11:22,675 --> 00:11:24,196
What did he say about this place?

182
00:11:24,956 --> 00:11:25,476
Like...

183
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,476
Can you shut up for two seconds?

184
00:11:28,356 --> 00:11:29,795
Let me concentrate.

185
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:32,956
Fine.

186
00:11:33,996 --> 00:11:35,155
Okay, got it.

187
00:11:47,035 --> 00:11:49,236
Let's all calm down.

188
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,915
How can we stay calm?

189
00:11:57,915 --> 00:11:59,196
Our lives are at stake.

190
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:00,915
Of course we're anxious.

191
00:12:01,076 --> 00:12:02,675
You understood everything earlier.

192
00:12:02,675 --> 00:12:03,596
The ballast stones,

193
00:12:03,596 --> 00:12:05,196
the murals, and everything.

194
00:12:05,196 --> 00:12:06,356
Why are you clueless now?

195
00:12:06,356 --> 00:12:07,555
Alright, truth time.

196
00:12:08,776 --> 00:12:09,915
I know nothing about here.

197
00:12:09,915 --> 00:12:11,116
Nothing.

198
00:12:11,675 --> 00:12:12,716
What I told you

199
00:12:12,716 --> 00:12:14,196
about the murals and oxygen supplies

200
00:12:14,476 --> 00:12:16,116
all came from my third uncle's stories.

201
00:12:16,476 --> 00:12:18,275
My third uncle came here 20 years ago

202
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:19,316
and faced

203
00:12:19,316 --> 00:12:20,555
what we face now.

204
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:30,875
Third Uncle.

205
00:13:36,091 --> 00:13:37,832
Hello? Hello?

206
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,316
They failed.

207
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,515
No. He has already found it.

208
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:47,515
What's next?

209
00:13:47,716 --> 00:13:50,675
Just wait. He will come to be with us.

210
00:13:51,196 --> 00:13:53,356
What exactly will you do
in that shipwreck?

211
00:13:53,996 --> 00:13:55,196
I'm not sure yet.

212
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,716
I'll know when I get there.

213
00:13:59,275 --> 00:14:01,275
But you demanded huge funding.

214
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:02,755
If you don't tell me why,

215
00:14:03,356 --> 00:14:04,996
I can't explain this to my boss.

216
00:14:08,076 --> 00:14:10,555
Compared to what you want,

217
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:13,076
this sum should be insignificant.

218
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,716
We need all the documents on that ship.

219
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,196
No problem.

220
00:14:23,436 --> 00:14:25,275
I'm after something else.

221
00:14:27,035 --> 00:14:28,236
This mission's dangerous.

222
00:14:28,395 --> 00:14:30,155
I'll send two men with you. Okay?

223
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:33,915
No problem.

224
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,555
You're the boss. It's your call.

225
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,716
His nephew is on our boat.

226
00:14:43,155 --> 00:14:45,356
He will take us to the right place.

227
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:50,476
Don't worry.

228
00:14:51,436 --> 00:14:55,116
The two guys
who went with Wu Sanxing before

229
00:14:55,515 --> 00:14:57,515
have left marks.

230
00:14:58,196 --> 00:14:59,716
As soon as we get there,

231
00:15:00,356 --> 00:15:01,635
I'll know

232
00:15:01,915 --> 00:15:03,875
what he has done.

233
00:17:30,876 --> 00:17:32,396
Alright, sit down.

234
00:17:32,956 --> 00:17:34,555
Sit down and relax.

235
00:17:35,676 --> 00:17:37,315
Why push yourself so hard?

236
00:17:38,636 --> 00:17:40,196
Taking such dangerous jobs?

237
00:17:40,196 --> 00:17:41,196
Money's hard to come by.

238
00:17:42,355 --> 00:17:43,315
True enough.

239
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:45,676
Money's hard to come by.

240
00:17:46,795 --> 00:17:48,355
What's your boss like?

241
00:17:48,755 --> 00:17:49,996
What business is your boss in?

242
00:17:50,115 --> 00:17:51,716
We never ask about our boss's affairs.

243
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:55,196
I'm not interested in your boss.

244
00:17:56,236 --> 00:17:57,755
Your boss's neighbor is a foreigner.

245
00:17:57,755 --> 00:17:58,636
Remember?

246
00:17:59,075 --> 00:17:59,996
That foreigner

247
00:18:01,075 --> 00:18:02,595
is a geologist.

248
00:18:04,035 --> 00:18:04,835
There we go.

249
00:18:05,236 --> 00:18:06,436
Move it. Move it.

250
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:07,676
Okay?

251
00:18:08,676 --> 00:18:09,436
Should work.

252
00:18:09,436 --> 00:18:10,595
Take it slow.

253
00:18:10,595 --> 00:18:11,355
Okay.

254
00:18:11,396 --> 00:18:13,595
I'm in geological exploration too.

255
00:18:13,595 --> 00:18:15,835
I've read that foreigner's paper.

256
00:18:15,835 --> 00:18:16,636
He wrote

257
00:18:17,115 --> 00:18:18,515
that if a meteorite

258
00:18:19,196 --> 00:18:21,156
strikes Earth's

259
00:18:21,515 --> 00:18:23,876
soft sedimentary plains,

260
00:18:24,035 --> 00:18:27,515
it forms annular water systems.

261
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:29,416
That hollow structure...

262
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,248
You...

263
00:18:30,696 --> 00:18:32,008
Have you seen such a place?

264
00:18:32,008 --> 00:18:33,196
I've been there.

265
00:18:34,835 --> 00:18:37,115
There's an enormous tree inside.

266
00:18:38,515 --> 00:18:39,795
How to describe it?

267
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,956
It's unimaginably huge.

268
00:18:43,035 --> 00:18:44,716
Could it be due to radiation

269
00:18:44,716 --> 00:18:46,196
causing this transgenic mutation?

270
00:18:55,156 --> 00:18:56,075
Third Master,

271
00:18:56,275 --> 00:18:57,436
what's that noise?

272
00:18:58,755 --> 00:19:00,716
This ship sank centuries ago.

273
00:19:01,755 --> 00:19:03,275
How could there be other people here?

274
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,636
Enough nonsense.

275
00:19:08,476 --> 00:19:09,275
Stay calm.

276
00:19:09,996 --> 00:19:10,835
You watch him.

277
00:19:10,835 --> 00:19:11,755
I'll check it out.

278
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:27,515
Why'd you follow me in?

279
00:19:27,676 --> 00:19:28,795
Take a break.

280
00:19:28,795 --> 00:19:30,716
We need to learn more from you.

281
00:20:00,515 --> 00:20:01,315
What are you doing?

282
00:20:01,956 --> 00:20:02,755
Don't move.

283
00:20:03,555 --> 00:20:04,355
Stay calm.

284
00:20:04,956 --> 00:20:05,755
Stay calm.

285
00:20:06,236 --> 00:20:07,075
Calm down.

286
00:20:07,595 --> 00:20:08,876
You can stop following us.

287
00:20:10,355 --> 00:20:11,636
Wait here for our return.

288
00:20:11,636 --> 00:20:12,476
Did you hear me?

289
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,115
Did you hear me?

290
00:20:16,795 --> 00:20:17,876
Yes, Third Master.

291
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,436
When my third uncle woke up,

292
00:21:40,555 --> 00:21:41,476
he discovered

293
00:21:42,196 --> 00:21:43,555
the place where he fell asleep

294
00:21:43,555 --> 00:21:45,075
and where he awoke

295
00:21:45,355 --> 00:21:46,515
were different locations.

296
00:21:47,436 --> 00:21:48,835
Not bad, kid.

297
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,436
You know quite a lot.

298
00:21:55,716 --> 00:21:56,676
Be more confident.

299
00:21:59,476 --> 00:22:01,315
What did your third uncle say
before leaving?

300
00:22:01,515 --> 00:22:02,515
Repeat it.

301
00:22:06,115 --> 00:22:07,236
He said...

302
00:22:09,156 --> 00:22:10,035
The elevator.

303
00:22:12,876 --> 00:22:14,315
That elevator had issues.

304
00:22:15,196 --> 00:22:16,075
The elevator.

305
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:17,236
The elevator?

306
00:22:18,076 --> 00:22:18,644
Yes.

307
00:22:52,315 --> 00:22:53,636
This is indeed a mechanism.

308
00:22:54,156 --> 00:22:56,156
And a remarkably simple one.

309
00:22:57,555 --> 00:22:58,636
Let me give an example.

310
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,035
You'll understand instantly.

311
00:23:00,676 --> 00:23:02,196
Imagine we're on the same floor.

312
00:23:02,996 --> 00:23:04,716
If I exit from the second floor

313
00:23:05,636 --> 00:23:07,515
and add another floor
below the first floor.

314
00:23:07,876 --> 00:23:09,275
When we return,

315
00:23:09,275 --> 00:23:10,676
the second floor becomes the third,

316
00:23:10,835 --> 00:23:12,315
and the first becomes the second.

317
00:23:12,315 --> 00:23:14,436
Stop with this floor-number shuffle

318
00:23:14,595 --> 00:23:15,555
and all the floors.

319
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:17,835
Speak normally, would you?

320
00:23:18,035 --> 00:23:18,916
I get it now.

321
00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:21,156
That...

322
00:23:21,755 --> 00:23:22,716
That corridor.

323
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:24,636
The corridor is actually an elevator.

324
00:23:24,956 --> 00:23:26,196
Every time its door opens,

325
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:28,595
it reveals a different floor.

326
00:23:28,795 --> 00:23:30,075
The rooms didn't vanish.

327
00:23:30,835 --> 00:23:32,515
They just moved elsewhere.

328
00:23:37,956 --> 00:23:39,236
So that's how it works.

329
00:23:40,196 --> 00:23:42,396
See how clear his explanation is?

330
00:23:46,476 --> 00:23:47,595
Any other questions?

331
00:23:48,236 --> 00:23:49,795
Your third uncle's account

332
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:51,795
contradicts our experience completely.

333
00:23:52,196 --> 00:23:53,515
Haven't you noticed?

334
00:23:54,236 --> 00:23:55,716
He said he was lying in this room

335
00:23:55,956 --> 00:23:57,196
and never used the corridor.

336
00:23:57,755 --> 00:23:59,355
No matter how the floors shifted,

337
00:23:59,476 --> 00:24:01,595
he should've stayed in the same room,

338
00:24:02,196 --> 00:24:03,515
and nothing should've changed.

339
00:24:12,436 --> 00:24:13,835
You're saying

340
00:24:14,355 --> 00:24:16,755
my third uncle lied to me?

341
00:24:22,755 --> 00:24:24,115
Cheer up, Wu.

342
00:24:25,236 --> 00:24:26,315
Your third uncle lying

343
00:24:26,315 --> 00:24:28,275
is absolutely normal.

344
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:31,355
He's a grown man.

345
00:24:32,275 --> 00:24:33,555
Would he admit

346
00:24:33,795 --> 00:24:36,755
he abandoned his girlfriend out of fear?

347
00:24:38,075 --> 00:24:38,795
Right?

348
00:24:39,515 --> 00:24:40,275
But he...

349
00:24:40,275 --> 00:24:41,876
No 'buts'.

350
00:24:43,196 --> 00:24:44,355
Ever been in love?

351
00:24:45,555 --> 00:24:47,196
Have you felt that

352
00:24:47,476 --> 00:24:49,236
soul-crushing pain?

353
00:24:51,996 --> 00:24:54,035
We're wasting oxygen here.

354
00:24:54,436 --> 00:24:55,075
Don't forget

355
00:24:55,075 --> 00:24:56,676
that girl mentioned earlier...

356
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,595
Carbon dioxide levels here
are dangerously high.

357
00:24:59,716 --> 00:25:01,275
At this concentration,

358
00:25:01,275 --> 00:25:02,515
within ten hours,

359
00:25:02,755 --> 00:25:04,156
we'll reach lethal thresholds.

360
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:05,035
We've got

361
00:25:05,035 --> 00:25:06,916
only ten hours down here.

362
00:25:07,035 --> 00:25:08,676
If we keep chatting like this,

363
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:11,835
we'll talk straight into our coffins.

364
00:25:12,835 --> 00:25:14,035
Well, I have

365
00:25:14,115 --> 00:25:15,876
three suggestions.

366
00:25:15,996 --> 00:25:18,676
First, find the missing room

367
00:25:19,196 --> 00:25:21,595
and retrieve our equipment.

368
00:25:22,035 --> 00:25:22,835
Second,

369
00:25:23,035 --> 00:25:24,396
catch that bratty girl.

370
00:25:24,595 --> 00:25:26,396
She knows the mechanisms.

371
00:25:26,515 --> 00:25:28,755
She must know this shipwreck well.

372
00:25:29,355 --> 00:25:30,196
Third,

373
00:25:31,035 --> 00:25:32,156
as Xiaoge suggested,

374
00:25:33,315 --> 00:25:34,595
chase that ballast stone.

375
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,515
But I saw something

376
00:25:36,515 --> 00:25:38,156
emerge from it.

377
00:25:38,396 --> 00:25:40,196
It could be friend or foe.

378
00:25:41,835 --> 00:25:42,636
Choose.

379
00:25:45,676 --> 00:25:47,835
Though we understand

380
00:25:47,835 --> 00:25:50,515
the elevator mechanism
makes the rooms shift,

381
00:25:52,315 --> 00:25:54,315
we still don't fully understand

382
00:25:54,436 --> 00:25:55,755
its operation pattern.

383
00:25:57,315 --> 00:25:59,035
So our original room may not

384
00:25:59,315 --> 00:26:00,676
necessarily return.

385
00:26:00,676 --> 00:26:01,436
Makes sense.

386
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:03,595
But Ning's location matches
the ballast stones.

387
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,676
Should we investigate

388
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:08,236
those two rooms first

389
00:26:08,515 --> 00:26:09,595
before deciding?

390
00:26:10,716 --> 00:26:11,636
Agreed.

391
00:26:12,515 --> 00:26:13,355
Let's go.

392
00:26:26,355 --> 00:26:27,876
Something's off.

393
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:11,555
It's over.

394
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:17,555
How did it become a dead end?

395
00:27:17,956 --> 00:27:18,876
Where's the door?

396
00:27:18,876 --> 00:27:20,396
Speak of the devil.

397
00:27:24,196 --> 00:27:25,355
Now

398
00:27:25,795 --> 00:27:26,835
we're trapped.

399
00:27:32,956 --> 00:27:34,035
Wu,

400
00:27:35,476 --> 00:27:36,956
prepare for

401
00:27:38,315 --> 00:27:40,916
all three options failing.

402
00:27:56,996 --> 00:27:58,196
To escape,

403
00:27:58,315 --> 00:27:59,956
here are our options.

404
00:28:00,795 --> 00:28:02,956
First, retrace our path.

405
00:28:03,476 --> 00:28:04,876
But that's no longer possible.

406
00:28:05,196 --> 00:28:06,196
Our lung capacity

407
00:28:06,196 --> 00:28:07,555
can't possibly match a dolphin's.

408
00:28:08,035 --> 00:28:08,795
Second,

409
00:28:10,396 --> 00:28:12,996
let the ship naturally surface.

410
00:28:14,876 --> 00:28:16,075
You can try tossing

411
00:28:16,075 --> 00:28:17,515
the ballast stones into the water.

412
00:28:17,795 --> 00:28:19,355
There are over two hundred rooms.

413
00:28:19,996 --> 00:28:20,956
Try tossing them first.

414
00:28:22,716 --> 00:28:24,196
Why don't you toss them yourself?

415
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:26,196
Who are you fooling?

416
00:28:26,196 --> 00:28:28,075
Who taught you such nonsense?

417
00:28:29,515 --> 00:28:30,315
And the third?

418
00:28:33,876 --> 00:28:35,075
The third

419
00:28:36,355 --> 00:28:38,035
and the dumbest approach is

420
00:28:40,035 --> 00:28:41,196
to dig our way out directly.

421
00:28:42,876 --> 00:28:43,956
This shipwreck

422
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:45,916
was built with high ceilings

423
00:28:46,555 --> 00:28:48,315
to accommodate the elevator mechanism.

424
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:52,275
So we can't be too far from the surface.

425
00:28:52,876 --> 00:28:54,515
If we wait for low tide

426
00:28:55,035 --> 00:28:56,196
and dig straight through,

427
00:28:56,555 --> 00:28:57,595
we might get out.

428
00:28:58,396 --> 00:28:59,196
Alright, then.

429
00:29:00,515 --> 00:29:02,636
Stop waiting. Let's get to work.

430
00:29:03,396 --> 00:29:04,716
Not to discourage you,

431
00:29:05,595 --> 00:29:07,555
but digging when it's not low tide

432
00:29:08,436 --> 00:29:10,555
means tons of water
pouring in from above.

433
00:29:11,595 --> 00:29:13,035
We'd drown

434
00:29:13,396 --> 00:29:14,716
before escaping.

435
00:29:16,716 --> 00:29:19,355
So rash actions are out.

436
00:29:24,236 --> 00:29:25,035
Xiaoge,

437
00:29:25,835 --> 00:29:27,636
any passage?

438
00:29:27,996 --> 00:29:29,515
Are we done for?

439
00:29:30,396 --> 00:29:32,115
I checked the mechanisms here.

440
00:29:32,115 --> 00:29:33,075
They're disabled.

441
00:29:33,636 --> 00:29:34,476
Come here.

442
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:54,355
Well,

443
00:29:55,476 --> 00:29:56,595
the door's here now.

444
00:30:00,355 --> 00:30:01,396
Go in or not?

445
00:30:04,275 --> 00:30:05,636
Our only choice is forward.

446
00:30:17,636 --> 00:30:18,436
Xiaoge,

447
00:30:18,876 --> 00:30:19,916
why the rush?

448
00:30:19,916 --> 00:30:20,956
Wait for us.

449
00:30:23,315 --> 00:30:24,115
Xiaoge?

450
00:30:26,156 --> 00:30:27,075
Don't use flashlights.

451
00:30:29,275 --> 00:30:30,595
Oh, no.

452
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:31,835
Something's wrong. Very wrong.

453
00:30:32,755 --> 00:30:34,835
Coming here was a huge mistake.

454
00:30:35,196 --> 00:30:36,236
Don't move.

455
00:30:39,075 --> 00:30:39,876
Xiaoge,

456
00:30:41,956 --> 00:30:43,156
I'll find a candle

457
00:30:43,156 --> 00:30:44,555
and light a corner. Okay?

458
00:30:47,275 --> 00:30:48,396
It's pitch black.

459
00:30:48,716 --> 00:30:49,996
We can't do anything properly.

460
00:30:50,436 --> 00:30:51,636
I'll assist you.

461
00:30:52,595 --> 00:30:53,636
It'll be quick.

462
00:30:53,835 --> 00:30:54,956
I'm just lighting a candle.

463
00:30:56,035 --> 00:30:56,876
Let's go.

464
00:31:00,396 --> 00:31:01,996
I think I mixed up the words earlier.

465
00:31:02,595 --> 00:31:04,795
It should be
'find a corner to light a candle'.

466
00:31:05,476 --> 00:31:07,515
No offense, spirits.

467
00:31:13,755 --> 00:31:14,876
Don't go out.

468
00:31:15,035 --> 00:31:15,996
Stay lit.

469
00:31:16,755 --> 00:31:17,916
Don't go out.

470
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:19,956
We're just looking around.

471
00:31:20,115 --> 00:31:20,956
Wu,

472
00:31:21,355 --> 00:31:22,795
have you noticed

473
00:31:22,795 --> 00:31:24,515
a strange smell here?

474
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,236
And it's getting colder.

475
00:31:27,916 --> 00:31:29,835
Like icy air

476
00:31:30,035 --> 00:31:32,315
rising from my feet to my skull.

477
00:31:37,035 --> 00:31:38,355
Why's there a cold draft?

478
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:41,156
Wait.

479
00:31:42,315 --> 00:31:44,115
How can there be wind underwater?

480
00:31:44,555 --> 00:31:45,275
Wu...

481
00:31:46,956 --> 00:31:48,236
Why'd you wander off?

482
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:02,355
Buddha, please protect us.

483
00:32:02,355 --> 00:32:03,956
Please keep us safe.

484
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:05,315
No obstacles in our path.

485
00:32:05,476 --> 00:32:10,075
Namo Amitabha Buddha.
Namo Amitabha Buddha.

486
00:32:10,275 --> 00:32:13,115
Good fortune and safety always.

487
00:32:13,236 --> 00:32:14,595
Don't worry, Buddha.

488
00:32:14,595 --> 00:32:15,956
We'll burn incense every festival,

489
00:32:15,956 --> 00:32:17,275
three sticks each time.

490
00:32:17,275 --> 00:32:19,035
No, we'll offer it daily.

491
00:32:19,035 --> 00:32:20,515
Wu, let's go.

492
00:32:21,035 --> 00:32:21,996
No talking.

493
00:32:22,676 --> 00:32:23,755
You weren't following.

494
00:32:23,755 --> 00:32:25,396
Now keep up.

495
00:32:29,436 --> 00:32:31,196
Look at you.

496
00:32:31,595 --> 00:32:33,035
You never listen,

497
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,075
