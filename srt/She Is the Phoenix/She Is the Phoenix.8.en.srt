My Lady, are you heading out?

12
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,440
You need not follow me.

13
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,280
Now that I've found the person behind you.

14
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,280
It's time

15
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,640
that you get burned in hell

16
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,280
and beg forgiveness

17
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,760
from my parents
and those innocent villagers.

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,840
Go to hell!

19
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,700
Help! Please, help!

20
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,900
Go to hell!

21
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,560
- Help!
- You're dead!

22
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,720
Stop!

23
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,260
What is happening here?

24
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,440
Master Tao wants me dead.

25
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,960
He's hurt many with this sword.

26
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,160
His personal attendant

27
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,320
was wounded last night
and didn't survive.

29
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,840
If you like it, have some more.

30
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,240
Father, I've found my place
at Ning Family.

31
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,440
I promise I'll honor you from now on.

32
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,400
That's all I hoped to hear.

33
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,760
I didn't love you for nothing.

34
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,680
Love? If I weren't lucky enough,

35
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,460
you'd have beaten me to death.

36
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,440
Nonsense.

37
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,720
Th-th-these pastries...

38
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,560
They're... poisoned!

39
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,760
A father who abandons his child
isn't worthy.

40
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,840
You deserve that.

41
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,880
Isn't this my jade pendant?

42
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,640
Greetings, Your Grace.

43
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,220
Your Grace.

44
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,200
(If they investigate, I'm done for.)

45
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,960
My Lady, Duke asks for you in the hall.

46
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,040
Did he mention what it's about?

47
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,440
I think it concerns your maid,

48
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,700
Jiang Leyao.

49
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,060
Jiang Leyao?

50
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,960
Yes, that's right.

51
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,720
She failed to look after Ning Tao.

52
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,360
Did Leyao commit some offense?

53
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,440
She did break the rules,

54
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,510
but you...

55
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,560
Your fault is even greater.

56
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,720
Please forgive me.

57
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,400
Master Tao is cared for by Jiang Leyao.

58
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,280
- Now that...
- Shouldn't you ask

59
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,440
what crime did I commit, My Lady?

60
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,680
(Isn't this about Ning Tao's poisoning?)

61
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,560
You married into our family

62
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,040
by faking your identity,

63
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,240
deceiving me, the hereditary peer.

64
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,320
You truly deserve punishment.

65
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,240
Why are you here?

66
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,800
Hand it over now.

67
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,440
This belongs to me.

68
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,800
Speaking nonsense without proof.

69
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,560
This jade pendant has a matching pair.

70
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,960
It's a family heirloom of my family.

71
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,600
Old Master once gifted this to another

72
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,120
as a token for marriage ties.

73
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,880
How did it become yours?

74
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,720
Your Grace, please forgive me.

75
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,400
This jade pendant pair was polished

76
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,720
by Old Master while resting at my home.

77
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,520
He gifted one to my grandfather

78
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,000
as a token of marriage ties.

79
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,540
I was so foolish
that Rong'er tricked me

80
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,680
into giving her the jade.

81
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,520
That's how she married Master Tao.

82
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,080
I know it's too late to say anything,

83
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,080
but this jade pendant

84
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,320
was left to me by my parents.

85
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,560
The only thing they left behind.

86
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,040
They've already...

87
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,560
perished in the fire.

88
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,880
This jade pendant

89
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,520
is the last keepsake from them.

90
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,680
I just wish to take it back

91
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,120
to remember them.
Your Grace, please spare me.

92
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,320
Rong'er, I'm truly sorry,

93
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,800
I just longed so much to get back

94
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,320
the keepsake my mother left me.

95
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:02,760
Nonsense.

96
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,940
It was my grandfather

97
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,040
who saved Old Master Ning.

98
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,640
When he was dying,

99
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,120
he handed me the jade pendant

100
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,320
and asked me

101
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,520
to our ancestors' wishes.

102
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,560
You mean he's dead?

103
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,800
That's right.

104
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,520
(All who knew are now gone.)

105
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,200
(No one can speak for you.)

106
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,880
Uncle Chang.

107
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,320
Is that really so?

108
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,800
(Impossible.)

109
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,000
(He... he was supposed to be dead.)

110
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,120
My Lord, he can be saved.

111
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,180
But he won't live long.

112
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,620
As long as he can name the killer.

113
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,840
Take her away.

114
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,080
That is

115
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,200
what happened.

116
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,720
He is still alive.

117
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,440
How will Chang Rong'er be dealt with?

118
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,560
Your Grace, it's for you to decide.

119
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,120
Chang Rong'er's death is no loss.

120
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,040
This marriage was set by the Old Master.

121
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,120
Why not take this chance

122
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,400
and set things right?

123
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,040
It isn't proper.

124
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,080
Master Tao is married.

125
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,520
How can we fix this now?

126
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,920
Your Grace,

127
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,800
if you wish to repay Old Master,

128
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,000
you could

129
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,920
accept Jiang Leyao as your adopted daughter.

130
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,400
Greetings, Father.

131
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,920
Rise.

132
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,320
Thank you, Father.

133
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,360
Chang Rong'er, you took another's place

134
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,040
and deceived everyone in Ning Manor.

135
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,640
Such a crime cannot be pardoned.

136
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,160
Guards!

137
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,960
Your Grace, please spare me!

138
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,800
Leyao, I was blinded by greed.

139
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,960
Please, help me.

140
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,960
Father,

141
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,800
Rong'er and I grew up together.

142
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,400
She's always looked after me.

143
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,440
Father, for my sake,

144
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,400
could you spare her?

145
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,960
It happens I need someone to serve me.

146
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,120
How about this,

147
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,320
let her come to my side

148
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,880
and be my servant girl.

149
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,080
Fine.

150
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,640
Let her serve you, then.

151
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,880
Thank you, Father.

152
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,320
Yes.

153
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,600
Leyao, you want to take my place, don't you?

154
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,400
You wretched girl, how dare you hit me?

155
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
Now I'm the mistress, you the maid.

156
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,880
What should you call me?

157
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,280
Don't you know?

158
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,360
Lady Leyao.

159
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,520
From now on, I'll obey your every word.

160
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,240
That's more like it.

161
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,840
Don't worry.

162
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,160
I won't make things too hard for you.

163
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,960
Chang Rong'er.

164
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,680
You must remember,

165
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,000
serve Master Tao well.

166
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,600
(She knows.)

167
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,320
(She must be behind this.)

168
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,640
Keep going.

169
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,280
I'll hide it as long as I can.

170
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
The most urgent thing

171
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,560
is to deal with Jiang Leyao first.

172
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,440
How strange this is.

173
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,960
That dog was always tame.

174
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,360
Why did it suddenly bite someone?

175
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,480
Father, Mother,

176
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,480
wait a bit longer.

177
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,240
I will make Chang Rong'er pay.

178
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,560
(What does this mean? She knows it all.)

179
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,630
