Your grandfather once saved
the Old Master

of the Ning Family.

13
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,000
That is why you and Tao are to be wed.

14
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,120
Our families are not an equal match,

15
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,860
but since you've entered Ning Manor

16
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,460
and won Tao's heart,

17
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,790
please honor your duties as a wife

18
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,270
from now on.

19
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,100
Yes.

20
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,150
I understand.

21
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,790
I want to better care for Master Tao,

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,990
from meals to daily life.

23
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,750
May I ask you to grant me
the right to manage

24
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,910
Second Courtyard's purchases.

25
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:39,670
That makes sense.

26
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,580
Congrats, My Lady.

27
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,640
Today is your wedding day with Master Tao.

28
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,360
We should hold a banquet to celebrate.

29
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,960
Let everyone in the manor

30
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,240
see you as their hostess.

31
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,680
Well said. I'll cook today.

32
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,760
Duke, I hope you will join us.

33
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,480
Of course.

34
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,640
Food, food.

35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,760
Delicious.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,840
Eat up.

38
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,400
Young man,

39
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,000
Madam Rong'er considered
those who can't join the feast.

40
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,640
She prepared a food box for you. Here.

41
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,800
The study is off limits.
I can't leave my post.

42
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,760
It's nothing, really. You...

43
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,680
Please leave.

44
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,480
(Didn't expect it to be so guarded.)

45
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,880
(Now what should I do?)

46
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,000
Tell me, why is my pay short this month?

47
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,660
Did you take some for yourself?

48
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,840
Still not talking, huh?

49
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,560
Let's see how I deal with you now.

50
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,420
Stop it!

51
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,640
Who are you?

52
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,480
Get out.

53
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,960
Alright, alright.

54
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
Thank you, miss.

55
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,320
You may stand.

56
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,960
Are you Nanny Zhao?

57
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,280
I didn't save you out of kindness.

58
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,080
I wish to work with you.

59
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,280
You've lingered outside the study
for days.

60
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,480
Are you trying to get inside?

61
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,800
That's right. Will you help me?

62
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:28,890
It's all right.

63
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,680
If you don't wish to,

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,080
just pretend I said nothing today.

65
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,190
Ten taels and four qian.

66
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,050
I need that sum to buy my freedom.

67
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,000
That troublemaker keeps going to the Duke.

68
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,520
Trying to win his favor?

69
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,150
Time to sleep.

70
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,490
I want to sleep with you.

71
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,480
I'm cold.

72
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,050
I'll go make you some Suiyu Cake.

73
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,220
You...

74
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,910
go sleep with that lady
who just passed by.

75
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,760
How about it?

76
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,110
She's very warm.

77
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,200
All right.

78
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,720
Jiang Leyao,

79
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,840
out of kindness, I'm giving you

80
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,120
this chance to get close to him.

81
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,960
You'd better enjoy this.

82
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,680
Sleep, just sleep.

83
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,940
I want to sleep now.

84
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,000
Let me go, let me go.

85
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,640
I just want to sleep.

86
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,320
I'm not who I used to be,

87
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,240
not the one you could push around.

88
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,320
It hurts.

89
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,060
It hurts!

90
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,440
Sleep now.

91
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,600
What an unexpected turn.

92
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,260
From today onward,

93
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,080
you have to

94
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,160
take care of Master Tao well.

95
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,420
(You can run,)

96
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,200
(but you can't escape him.)

97
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,800
Lockdown.

98
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,840
(Tonight is the night
to meet Xiao Jingchu.)

99
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,130
(If I miss it,)

100
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,190
(our cooperation)

101
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,400
(may not go smoothly.)

102
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,100
Where are you going?

103
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,730
Master Tao.

104
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:08,730
Master Tao.

105
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,720
I'm fetching pastries for you.

106
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,440
Will you wait for me here?

107
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,880
No, Rong'er told me to sleep with you.

108
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,760
Master Tao, do you like Rong'er?

109
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,190
I do. She smells nice.

110
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,120
Then you can't sleep with anyone else.

111
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,440
Because women often say the opposite.

112
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,880
So Rong'er means

113
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,560
you should go sleep with her.

114
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,000
Find Rong'er, find Rong'er.

115
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,180
Find Rong'er, find Rong'er.

116
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,010
Forgive me, My Lord.

117
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,560
I must care for Master Tao.

118
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,800
Is that fool really so important?

119
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,240
You'll be done,

120
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,640
if you make me wait again.

121
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,620
The weather's turned cold.

122
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,360
I had some free time today.

123
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,760
So I made a pair of knee guards for you.

124
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,530
You've helped me many times.

125
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,590
I hope you'll like it.

126
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,830
No need.

127
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,400
Who made these?

128
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,680
No one special.

129
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,080
You belong to me.

130
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,320
Anyone hurting you is hurting me.

131
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,740
My Lord.

132
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,210
Please, My Lord, help Miss Leyao.

133
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,720
Today, Miss Leyao

134
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,320
was supposed to go to the Duke's study.

135
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,960
But on the way, Master Tao stopped her.

136
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:23,100
He kept harassing her.

137
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,080
Miss Leyao refused.

138
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,880
So he started shouting and hitting her.

139
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,520
Where is he now?

140
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,200
I've already restrained him.

141
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,120
Dealing with him
made me late to the study.

142
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,960
Does that matter?

143
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,800
My Lord, are you worried about me?

144
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,600
I'm just worried
you'll fail your mission.

145
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,880
This is the one you're seeking.

146
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,940
