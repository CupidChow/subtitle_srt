How dare you plot against me?

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,310
We're following His Majesty's order.

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,630
This Imperial Seal
will be yours someday.

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,950
I've been Crown Prince for so long,

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,130
yet I'm never allowed to inherit.

16
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,350
Then I'll seize the throne.

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,480
Guards!

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,070
Summon the Commander of the Imperial Guards,

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,550
and the Minister of War.

20
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,830
Invite them to my manor for wine.

23
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,800
Lord Jiang.

24
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,670
Please, help me.

25
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,520
Get up, quickly.

26
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,350
What on earth happened?

27
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,510
Tell me.

28
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,560
My Lord,

29
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,790
I am a court musician.

30
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,110
I was sent to play
at the Crown Prince's manor.

31
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,470
But the Crown Prince, he...

32
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,470
He humiliated me before everyone.

33
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,230
There is nothing I can do.

35
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,540
(Ning Manor)

36
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,460
Lord Jiang,

37
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,750
aren't such matters your calling?

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,270
Why are you powerless now?

39
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,670
I'm in officialdom,

40
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,350
but I blend with the mundane as well.

41
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,230
Do you?

42
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,550
You're just colluding with them.

43
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,590
You once promised

44
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,910
to speak out for justice for women,

45
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,990
and give them a voice.

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,230
You even vowed to defy the powerful

47
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,310
and fear no tyranny.

48
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,470
Jiang Leyao,

49
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,070
you're nothing but a liar!

50
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,230
(Ning Manor)
You're no different from them.

51
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,200
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,870
All I can say is,

53
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,680
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,070
It's not me you should apologize to,

55
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,750
but to the official position you're in,

56
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,470
and the countless wronged girls.

57
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,270
Jiang Leyao, you will not be forgiven.

58
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,320
Enough!

59
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,780
(Ning Manor)

60
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,710
You dare defy Lord Jiang? Seize her!

61
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,880
Stop right there.

62
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,240
Leave now.

63
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,190
Miss Jiang, why suffer so?

64
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,470
People like this need a lesson.

65
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,710
Don't blame her.

66
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,670
Even I am disappointed

67
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,110
in myself.

68
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,120
By the way,

69
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,990
how is Lord Xiao at home?

70
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,640
Just like you,

71
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,070
he endures harsh words.

72
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,510
You two are truly ill-fated.

73
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,360
Who knows how long this will last.

74
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,080
Not much longer.

75
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,350
Is there any news

76
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,070
from the Crown Prince?

77
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,870
As you arranged,

78
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,770
the Crown Prince now knows

79
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,720
who caused his illness.

80
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,230
He knows he won't be heir.

81
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,550
He's now drinking wine
with the ministers.

82
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,920
Everyone,

83
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,190
I'd like to toast.

84
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,070
Cheers.

85
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,160
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

86
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,630
Just entertainment?

87
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,110
No one knows

88
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,960
what he's planning.

89
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,040
Father.

90
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,030
How could you side with Xiao Jingchu

91
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,310
and accused the Crown Prince?

92
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,350
What will become of the Ning Family?

93
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,270
Father, you're right.

94
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,880
I know I was wrong.

95
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,750
I'll go apologize to the Crown Prince.

96
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,120
Stop.

97
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,030
Tonight is not the time to apologize.

98
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,670
The Crown Prince won't see you now.

99
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,950
He has important matters to handle.

100
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,400
Important matters?

101
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,670
What could be so important?

102
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,750
Something that could change the dynasty.

103
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,510
The Crown Prince...

104
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,760
No.

105
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,030
No.

106
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,830
When we meet him again,

107
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,790
we may have to address him

108
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,550
as "Your Majesty".

109
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,750
What do you mean by that?

110
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,550
Minister of War, Lord Zhao,

111
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,870
Commander of the Imperial Guards,
Lord Chu,

112
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,470
have you made up your mind?

113
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,630
You're not allowed
to have private dealings

114
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,480
with us.

115
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,270
I could never agree to a rebellion.

116
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,280
And you?

117
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,870
The Guards have always served
His Majesty.

118
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,670
I hope you won't force me, Your Highness.

119
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,270
Do you really believe

120
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,430
I want to hear your thoughts

121
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,030
about the rebellion?

122
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,230
Bring it forward.

123
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,750
The hand of my brother.

124
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,630
I'm sure you both recognize it.

125
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,190
If you refuse to listen to me,

126
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,190
what I present next time

127
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,390
won't be just a hand.

128
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,790
We await your orders, Your Highness.

129
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,310
He dares to start a rebellion.

130
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,870
The Crown Prince said,

131
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,110
the throne was his to begin with.

132
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,510
He only wishes to claim it early.

133
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,550
Why are you telling me all this?

134
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,990
Aren't you afraid I'll go to the palace

135
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,430
to warn them?

136
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,190
My dear daughter,

137
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,790
you've already angered the Crown Prince.

138
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,110
There's no way out for you now.

139
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,310
But as your father,

140
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,890
I still have the Ning Family.

141
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,230
I won't take the blame for you.

142
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,720
What's your plan?

143
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,310
My good daughter.

144
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,350
I'll bring your body with me

145
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,630
to face the new emperor.

146
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,070
That will be my roof of allegiance.

147
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,080
Father,

148
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,590
I'm your own daughter.

149
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,030
Could you really do it, Father?

150
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,310
Even my own daughter, I could kill.

151
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,110
Let alone a girl from nowhere.

152
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,030
Wealth and glory are within reach.

153
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,070
What do two daughters matter?

154
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,590
You've been watching long enough.

155
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,670
Isn't it time you stepped in?

156
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,230
You saved me.

157
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,480
That's right.

158
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,590
I pulled you out of prison myself

159
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,190
and found a physician

160
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,390
who cured the deadly poison in you.

161
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,800
What now?

162
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,070
Don't tell me you still hope

163
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,390
your father was the one who saved you?

164
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,630
I can tell you

165
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,110
all about the Crown Prince,

166
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,670
but I have a condition.

167
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,910
Today, the people drinking with him

168
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,550
were the Minister of War
and the Commander.

169
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,350
Are you saying he's planning rebellion?

170
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,830
If he truly takes the throne,

171
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,270
then Duke Ning will become
a top minister.

172
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,430
He wishes.

173
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,310
I've decided on my condition,

174
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,070
I want to go home.
