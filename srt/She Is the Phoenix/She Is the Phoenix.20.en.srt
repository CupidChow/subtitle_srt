11
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,200
Are you expecting a child?

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,160
I...

13
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,200
Your Highness,

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,990
this is all my doing alone.

15
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,190
Please, do not implicate the Ning Family.

16
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,150
At this point,

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,470
will you still keep hiding it?

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,840
Grandmother,

19
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,470
the child Bingqing carries

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,640
is mine.

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,640
You...

22
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,340
=Episode 20=
=Heir to the Throne=

23
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,430
Is there something you'd like to say?

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,040
No matter who asks,

25
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,390
you must insist firmly

26
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,190
the child you carry

27
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,520
is mine.

28
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,550
As for the Duke Ning...

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,830
I am still the Crown Prince

30
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,670
and you are soon to be Crown Princess.

31
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,550
Even if he has other plans,

32
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,270
he won't dare act rashly.

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,840
Bingqing,

34
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,750
the herbal medicine is ready.

35
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,130
Leyao, what did you add this time?

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,200
Bingqing, you jest.

37
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,110
After all, you carry the royal heir.

38
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,440
Yes,

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,950
the heir to the throne.

40
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,950
As long as the Crown Prince admits it,

41
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,830
then the child I carry

42
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,030
must be seen as an imperial heir.

43
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,430
Do you know what you are saying?

44
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,720
Grandmother,

45
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,040
that day,

46
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,550
I was drugged by a maid seeking favor.

47
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,030
She gave me a strong aphrodisiac.

48
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,550
I wished not to betray Bingqing,

49
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,800
but I had no cure at hand,

50
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,800
so...

51
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,310
All of this is my own doing.

52
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,590
Please punish me.

53
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,390
(Why does the Crown Prince claim this child?)

54
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,390
(Is he truly so devoted to Ning Bingqing?)

55
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,190
Enough, rise.

56
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,710
Thank you, Grandmother.

57
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,990
I shall inform His Majesty

58
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,950
and arrange your wedding soon.

59
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,970
- Thank you, Grandmother.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

60
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,630
How dare mere commoners challenge the God?

61
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,910
In the end, it's just wishful thinking.

62
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,790
You think rules of status and wealth

63
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,430
could be overturned by someone like you?

64
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,320
Leyao,

65
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,830
it's your turn to face this now.

66
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,580
Who will claim victory

67
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,950
remains to be seen.

68
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,190
With this witness testimony,

69
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,230
the charge of Qiao Ping harming Nanny Zhao

70
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:21,950
now stands.

71
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,260
(Testimony)

72
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,550
Qiao Ping,

73
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,310
you deserve punishment.

74
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,990
Qiao Ping is no ordinary guard.

75
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,750
Don't act rashly.

76
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,880
Trust me,

77
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,910
I will see justice done for you.

78
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,870
Jiang Leyao.

79
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,030
Lady Bingqing says
her wedding robe isn't red enough.

80
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,750
She wants your blood to deepen the shade.

81
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,310
Golden Silken Armor.

82
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,990
A life for a life.

83
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,790
Today,

84
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,750
I'll send you to join Nanny Zhao.

85
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,270
This Golden Silken Armor

86
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,670
is impervious to weapons.

87
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,870
Wear it, just in case.

88
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,090
My Lady,

89
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,870
Jiang Leyao won't survive this time.

90
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,160
Death?

91
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,430
That's far too easy for her.

92
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,670
You've done well in this post.

93
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,950
At least the death held meaning.

94
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,720
My dear Leyao,

95
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,830
you've taken a life.

96
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:47,690
You...

97
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,310
You let Qiao Ping to die on purpose.

98
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,600
Yes, I did.

99
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,110
I just wanted to see

100
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,280
what more

101
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,390
can Xiao Jingchu do for you?

102
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,640
Open the door.

103
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,750
Xiao Jingchu.

104
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,670
Leyao, are you alright?

105
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,280
Are you hurt anywhere?

106
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,240
Let me take a look.

107
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,190
Don't worry about me.

108
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,320
You should go.

109
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,430
I don't want to drag you down.

110
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,710
You and I have long been together.

111
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,390
You're not a burden.

112
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,350
If I were the one in prison today,

113
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,150
would you leave me behind?

114
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,110
Don't worry,
I've led Xuanyin Division for years.

115
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,240
You can rest easy.

116
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,990
Leave the rest to me.

117
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,860
My Lord.

118
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,130
My Lord.

119
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,200
The palace has sent word.

120
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,010
The Duke Ning is with His Majesty,

121
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,310
accusing you of shielding the suspect.

122
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,260
My Lady,

123
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,350
you sent Lady Leyao to Xuanyin Division.

124
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,470
Aren't you afraid Lord Xiao will protect her?

125
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,310
I want him to shield her.

126
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,830
One schemed against me,

127
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,390
and the other betrayed me.

128
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,390
Both deserve no mercy.

129
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,550
Any word from the palace lately?

130
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,160
Nothing so far.

131
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,510
Send Qiao Ping to find out more.

132
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,230
My Lady, about Qiao Ping...

133
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,230
Please calm down.

134
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,040
My Lady.

135
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,690
You're expecting, My Lady.

136
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,610
My Lady, you're expecting.

137
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,790
Stay out of this.

138
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,720
Miss Jiang.

139
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,990
Where is Xiao Jingchu?

140
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,040
Has he left the palace?

141
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,120
Are you all right?

142
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,350
Lord Xiao has come out now.

143
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,200
He's fine.

144
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,590
But he has official duties

145
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,440
to attend to.

146
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,630
So he sent me to bring your meal.

147
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,800
That's not the truth.

148
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,000
Lord Xiao...

149
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,810
He was punished by flogging.
