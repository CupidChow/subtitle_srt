11
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,750
Now the Northwest faces
grave a disaster.

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,710
Tens of thousands go hungry each day.

13
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,550
Do either of you have any good ideas?

14
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,000
Father,

15
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,710
the bandits thrive
in the Northwest.

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,950
If we send out disaster relief grain,

17
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,350
I'm afraid it'll be stolen.

18
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,710
And the locals there are hard to manage,

19
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,630
so it's best not to interfere.

20
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,830
And what about you?

21
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,470
The people there are also yours.

22
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,270
If we abandon them now,

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,310
we may lose their trust.

24
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,110
I believe

25
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,510
we should send capable officials

26
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,030
from the Ministry of Revenue

27
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,910
to calculate the needed grain,

28
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,670
and open local granaries,

29
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,070
so that the urgent crisis
is eased first.

30
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,390
Good.

31
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,790
From tomorrow, join me in the Imperial Study.

32
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,510
Thank you, Father.

33
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,640
Rise.

34
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,330
As for you,

35
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,950
spend more time reading

36
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,270
the classics of the sages.

37
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,480
Guards.

38
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,960
Take them away.

39
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,310
Go inform Duke Ning,

40
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,870
the Beasts Garden opens tonight.

41
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,550
Tell him, do not let me down.

42
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,800
Yes.

43
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,220
=Episode 25=
=Beasts Garden=

44
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,000
Leyao.

45
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,230
The Crown Prince invites you
to the outskirts villa.

46
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,230
Dress well and look your best.

47
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,110
Remember to act with respect and grace.

48
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,030
Bring honor to the Ning Family.

49
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,600
(Xiao Jingyou,)

50
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,310
(your secret
will soon be revealed to all.)

51
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,270
(By then, you must kneel)

52
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,670
(and apologize
to the innocent lives lost.)

53
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:02,970
Father.

54
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,470
Let's go. I will take you there myself.

55
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,080
What is it?

56
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,200
It's nothing.

57
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,240
Stop the carriage.

58
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,350
Take me to Yuqian Palace.

59
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,110
Even if

60
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,710
you pierce through

61
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,510
my heart with this dagger,

62
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,550
I won't let you put yourself at risk.

63
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,590
No one can stand in my way.

64
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,230
Who would've thought my brother

65
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,430
would be so devoted in love.

66
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,470
That's good.

67
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,390
I can't wait to see his face

68
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,790
when he learns his beloved

69
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,630
has suffered humiliation.

70
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,600
Ready the horses.

71
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,600
Yes.

72
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,800
Father.

73
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,030
Why are you so late? Go inside.

74
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,390
Don't keep everyone waiting.

75
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,320
Everyone?

76
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,630
Isn't it just the Crown Prince?

77
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,430
They're all his men.

78
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,230
You'll marry him,

79
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,830
so you should get to know them.

80
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,590
I see.

81
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,210
Go inside.

82
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,150
From now on, you'll outshine all
in the Capital.

83
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,070
You are the pride of the Ning Family.

84
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,510
Let's go.

85
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,230
(From now on, your vile deeds)

86
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,190
(will be laid bare to the world)

87
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,750
(and scorned by all people.)

88
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,370
(Your disgrace will last forever.)

89
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,190
A virgin, how rare.

90
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,280
Outrageous!

91
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,150
So you are the Lady Inspector
appointed by Her Majesty.

92
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,750
You're the first female official
of our dynasty.

93
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,150
My respects.

94
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,760
It's you.

95
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,710
Not me. You've got the wrong person.

96
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,960
Stop right there!

97
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,920
Don't.

98
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,150
(Xiao Jingyou, your end has come.)

99
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,310
Greetings, Your Highness.

100
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,110
You know nothing of courtesy.

101
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,230
Here, only wild beasts roam.

102
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,280
No humans dwell here.

103
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,950
You

104
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,070
must face punishment.

105
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,270
(Oh no, it's the Furong Elixir.)

106
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,510
Watch closely now.

107
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,870
This is my newest catch.

108
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,030
Don't let her escape.

109
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,030
As long as you like,

110
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,030
I vow to gather every maiden

111
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,030
in the land,

112
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,750
all for your delight, Your Highness.

113
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,310
But if

114
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,510
what I seek is more than this,

115
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,990
could you still get it for me?

116
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,630
We may not know each other's names,

117
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,230
yet we serve you the same, Your Highness.

118
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,230
Donning the imperial yellow robe.

119
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,550
Radiant divine light shines forth.

120
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,860
Long live the Emperor, forevermore.

121
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:01,030
Long live the Emperor.

122
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,430
You may rise.

123
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,710
Thank you, Your Majesty.

124
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,950
Do you know where you are?

125
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,600
I do not know.

126
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:18,730
But I do know

127
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,230
that you own Ruyi House
behind the scenes.

128
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,750
Begonia Snow also belongs to you.

129
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,590
You colluded with the Dali Court.

130
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,200
And you are the mastermind

131
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,990
behind the twelve arson village cases.

132
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,630
So what if I am?

133
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,750
The death of mere commoners

134
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,990
brings me some amusement.

135
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,030
That is their only honor.

136
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,070
Shame on you!

137
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,910
As the Crown Prince,

138
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,310
you kill for pleasure,

139
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,260
with no regard for life.

140
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,990
You are worse than a beast.

141
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,790
So you and Xiao Jingchu are alike,

142
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,750
both cut from the same cloth.

143
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,150
What now, trying to investigate me?

144
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,510
Trying to take me down?

145
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,590
It's a pity.

146
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,550
I saw through you long ago.

147
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,190
All your petty tricks.

148
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,510
I played along from the start.

149
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,500
Tonight,

150
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,470
there's no way you'll leave here.

151
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,870
Everyone,

152
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,030
take off her robes.

153
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,390
Let her add some excitement

154
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,490
to the Beast Banquet tonight.

155
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,040
Who are you?

156
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,230
Your Highness,

157
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,970
didn't expect this, huh?

158
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,230
