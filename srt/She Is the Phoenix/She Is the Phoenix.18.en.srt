=She Is the Phoenix=

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,000
Jin Lian walks in with graceful steps.

12
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,560
She loosens her silk robe with care.

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,000
At her side stands Lord Ximen.

14
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,120
He lifts a cherry in his hand

15
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,840
and gently feeds the cherry to her.

16
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,800
Her face as pure as a lotus,

17
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,600
yet her body is enchanting,

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,040
like a spirit who lures the soul.

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,160
What a marvelous sight indeed.

20
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,440
Duke Ning, you truly raised her well.

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,840
I had her

22
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,560
learn to read and write

23
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,840
so she could be a noble lady

24
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,320
all for serving you, sir.

25
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,640
Since you're so sincere,

26
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,120
I might as well stay a few more days.

27
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,560
Very well.

28
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,400
Cheers.

29
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,340
=Episode 18=
=Noble Lady=

30
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,920
He does it so skillfully.

31
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,320
This can't be his first time.

32
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,140
The scout reports,

33
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,560
the courtyard belongs to Qiao Ping

34
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,440
and Begonia Snow is also run by him.

35
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,480
Qiao Ping was raised by the Duke Ning

36
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,760
and later became Bingqing's bodyguard.

37
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,340
Could it be he's a puppet

38
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,360
of the Duke Ning?

39
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:55,530
No.

40
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,560
Identities can be faked,

41
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,440
but eyes never lie.

42
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,720
Even if he's a puppet,

43
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,280
he's only Bingqing's puppet.

44
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,320
Then whose puppet

45
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,120
is Ning Bingqing?

46
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,200
Someone above the Duke Ning.

47
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,560
Who could that be?

48
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,960
(So these three days...)

49
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,480
Why are you here?

50
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,280
Just now,

51
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,760
I heard you crying.

52
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,280
You must've misheard.

53
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,160
I was singing.

54
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,600
This is my home,

55
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,840
I can do

56
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,200
however I like.

57
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,360
In these last three days,

58
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,720
were you truly happy?

59
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,440
I spent three days copying scrolls.

60
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,680
I couldn't be happier.

61
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,920
Though we share a grudge,

62
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,440
I still pity your current state,

63
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,240
pretending to be something you're not.

64
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,240
Ning Bingqing,

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,600
if you wish to work with me,

66
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,120
you can visit me anytime.

67
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,880
Never thought,

68
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,400
the only one to bring me medicine here

69
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,120
would be her.

70
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,440
How could Jiang Leyao be so kind?

71
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,000
A lowborn girl like her

72
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,360
must be here just to mock me.

73
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,000
I won't let you have it easy.

74
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,080
Leyao.

75
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,760
The Duke Ning just won the docks deal.

76
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,680
Seems he used his own daughter for it.

77
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,480
But Ning Bingqing isn't really his child.

78
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,920
She's just a pawn for his schemes.

79
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,520
If that's the case,

80
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,120
no wonder Bingqing ended up like this.

81
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,400
It seems tied to his training,

82
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,960
and the threats she's endured.

83
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,400
There's always a reason behind one's plight.

84
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,800
However,

85
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,000
she is Duke Ning's legitimate daughter,

86
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,280
and the future Crown Princess.

87
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,080
The one behind it all

88
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,520
must hold great power at court.

89
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,920
Leyao,

90
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,920
if we keep digging,

91
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,960
we might end up in danger.

92
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,880
Then,

93
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,140
should we keep investigating?

94
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,690
We will.

95
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,240
But,

96
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,800
though we know of the Duke Ning's dealings,

97
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,110
still,

98
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,800
about the wealthy merchant

99
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,840
who visited his manor,

100
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,720
we still have no idea.

101
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,120
There's someone who can help us.

102
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,400
Who is it?

103
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,920
Ning Bingqing has suffered so much.

104
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,800
Qiao Ping

105
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,440
will surely stand up for her.

106
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,760
Miss.

107
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,960
Miss, I've got the Divorce Decree.

108
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,960
The Divorce Decree
I've waited twenty years for.

109
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,560
Finally, it's in my hands.

110
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,480
That's wonderful.

111
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,960
Let me tell you another good news.

112
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,440
I don't wish to work with you anymore.

113
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,320
What do you mean?

114
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,720
Didn't you say you were born in Jiangnan,

115
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,680
sold by your parents and brought here?

116
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,800
Actually, you were taken against your will.

117
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,640
Your real parents never stopped

118
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,800
searching for you all these years.

119
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,880
So, I was never abandoned?

120
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,440
Of course not.

121
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,640
I've already brought

122
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,280
your real parents to the Capital.

123
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,480
Here is your indenture of servitude.

124
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,720
From now on, you're free.

125
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,760
And this is

126
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,960
a small gift from me,

127
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,840
my last token of kindness.

128
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,160
Take it with you when you leave,

129
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,280
and live well with your parents.

130
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
I'm worried that once I leave,

131
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,200
no one will be here to help you.

132
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,920
What you say makes sense.

133
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,840
But if you still won't accept it,

134
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,000
I may just change my mind.

135
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,720
Take it, and keep it safe.

136
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,160
Don't cry.

137
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,160
Live your days well, alright?

138
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,440
You may not know this,

139
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,360
but when it comes to serving others

140
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,040
even noble ladies

141
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,760
are as pathetic as stray dogs.

142
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,160
Which family's noble lady is she?

143
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,640
Hush, don't pry too much.

144
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,840
You only need to know one thing,

145
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,880
she's tied to an important figure.

146
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,080
Seems like this person

147
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,240
is the wealthy merchant who visited the Duke.

148
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,160
He uses this tale to show off.

149
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,760
Honestly, he's the pathetic one.

150
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,360
I want to give him a lesson.

151
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,400
Look over there,

152
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,240
seems someone's about to do just that.

153
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,200
Leyao was right about him.

154
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,760
Qiao Ping is standing up for Bingqing.

155
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,960
But,

156
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,360
this works out well.

157
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,880
Now we have reason to arrest him.

158
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,600
So, shall we take him in now?

159
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,280
Arrest him.

160
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,430
But...

161
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Let him slip away.

162
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,240
I want to alert the enemy.

163
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,000
I want to

164
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,120
see what Ning Bingqing does next.

165
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,840
Yes.

166
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,880
Useless.

167
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,400
You caught Xiao Jingchu's attention.

168
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,720
I only wanted to help you, My Lady.

169
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,280
But rest assured, My Lady.

170
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,880
I'll find a place to hide.

171
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,600
You won't be implicated.

172
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,840
Since you wish to help me,

173
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,840
do one more thing for me.

174
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,480
What is it?

175
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,240
I never want to see Jiang Leyao again.

176
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,800
Nanny Zhao.

177
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,080
I asked for a peace amulet for you.

178
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,040
