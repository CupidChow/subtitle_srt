Stop. She's with me.

12
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,310
Where do you think you're taking her?

13
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,160
Get lost.

14
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,470
This is business.

15
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,310
It's not your place to meddle.

16
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,910
The maid made a mistake.

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,750
Her mistress shares the blame.

18
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,470
Madam Rong'er, now it's your turn.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,230
How dare you!

20
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,190
I am the Young Madam.

21
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,640
(Rong'er, next,)

22
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,290
(how will you end this?)

23
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,310
What right do you have

24
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,550
to enforce family discipline?

25
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,670
It is set by the Duke
and the Second Young Master.

26
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,310
But in the Second Courtyard,

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,670
my word is law.

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,040
Guards.

29
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,910
Seize Madam Rong'er,

30
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,630
give her thirty strokes of the staff.

31
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,830
She is to be confined.

32
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,550
Her fate will be decided
once the masters return.

=Episode 4=

34
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,490
My Lord,

35
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,990
the culprit killed himself.

36
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,390
Even if we suspect a link to the Nings,

37
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,070
our last clue is now gone.

38
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,750
Then seek out new leads.

39
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,880
Yes.

40
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,270
Thank you, Lord Xiao, for saving me.

41
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,590
Can't even handle this small trouble,

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,350
yet you wish to be my informant.

43
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,070
My Lord, I can get you to help.

44
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,110
That's proof of my ability.

45
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,070
So you do have some skill.

46
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,870
Framing your own master,

47
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,190
and luring me in.

48
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,710
What are you after?

49
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,230
The Nings bully the weak.

50
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,510
I want to draw you in

51
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,830
to bring down the Ning Family.

52
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,470
At least you're honest.

53
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,230
I'll give you a chance.

54
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,390
In Duke Ning's study,

55
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,470
there's an account ledger
for Ruyi House.

56
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,280
Go fetch it for me.

57
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,430
I'll do my utmost.

58
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,070
Report to me every two days.

59
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,320
My Lord,

60
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,150
it's hard for me to go out.

61
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,110
I'll come find you.

62
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,070
Then, My Lord, can you promise

63
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,110
that if I ever face danger,

64
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,910
you'll show up in time to help?

65
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,390
Once you work for me,
you're under my care.

66
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,430
I'll keep you safe.

67
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,910
Thank you, My Lord.

68
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,550
Since we're in this together,

69
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,630
and you gather intel for me,

70
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,160
tell me,

71
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,710
what do you want from me?

72
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,160
My Lord,

73
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,550
you just need to watch from afar,

74
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,030
sit back, and enjoy the chaos.

75
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,750
Return my scented sachet.

76
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,310
Someone, bring me water!

77
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,670
Is everyone gone?

78
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,230
Why have you come back?

79
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,070
Isn't the Xuanyin Division a one-way door?

80
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,070
Lord Xiao just wanted to investigate

81
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,230
the fire in the village.

82
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,790
Was it started by someone?

83
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,990
No, that blaze was truly an accident.

84
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,280
That's right.

85
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,640
It was an accident.

86
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,310
So I came back.

87
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,440
I'm glad you're back.

88
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,990
I had no other choice then.

89
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,510
It was a dangerous moment.

90
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,190
I already had a backup plan.

91
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,390
You'd only get a scolding.

92
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,110
Your life was never at risk.

93
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,230
You must always trust me.

94
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,830
Of course, I believe you.

95
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,550
You're my sister. How could you hurt me?

96
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,630
Naturally, I would never harm you.

97
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,610
(Since your luck held,)

98
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,790
(stay alive.)

99
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,830
(I may need your help someday.)

100
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,050
Duke Ning is about to arrive

101
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,320
with the Second Young Master.

102
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,650
Qi Zhen will surely twist the truth first.

103
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,810
Rong'er, do you have a plan?

104
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,470
Duke Ning is busy with affairs.

105
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,790
He won't bother with us.

106
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,830
But Ning Tao is a bit unpredictable.

107
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,710
He listens to Qi Zhen in everything.

108
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,310
With your beauty and wit,

109
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,230
winning the Young Master's heart

110
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,790
should be easy.

111
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,310
I won't serve that fool.

112
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,470
But things are dire right now.

113
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,790
Serving him is better
than being cast out.

114
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,950
I'm already prepared.

115
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,270
I've made his favorite Suiyu Cake.

116
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,670
I even added Hehuan Powder to it.

117
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,400
No, don't!

118
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,750
(I fed that fool Hehuan Powder.)

119
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,870
(Leyao, enjoy yourself now.)

120
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,510
Help me with my hair.

121
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,110
(Since you've taken my place,)

122
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,150
(you should taste what I've endured.)

123
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,400
Alright.

124
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,230
Master Tao, does it taste good?

125
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,360
It's hot.

126
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,910
Hot? A nap will help.

127
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,880
Sleep.

128
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,960
Don't bite me!

129
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,790
Master Tao.

130
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,190
