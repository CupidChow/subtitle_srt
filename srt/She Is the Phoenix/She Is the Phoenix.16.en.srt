11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,310
My Lord, as per your instructions,

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,350
we used the Begonia Snow fire to investigate.

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,030
We were about to catch a whole group,

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,120
but then, things changed.

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,390
The Dali Court intercepted them.

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,590
Leyao said,

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,510
Ning Bingqing can read
the Dali Court's files.

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,630
She and the Dali Court

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,140
must have some connection.

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,230
We're working ourselves to the bone,

21
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,430
but in the end,
Dali Court gets all the credit.

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,990
Maybe we should change
Xuanyin Division's name.

23
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,230
What should we call it then?

24
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,750
Charity Division.

25
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,710
Without investigation,

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,710
they just ruled it an accidental fire.

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,270
The method was so practiced.

28
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,230
It can't be their first time.

29
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:31,980
My Lord,

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,710
are you even listening to me?

31
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,710
Who do you think

32
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,350
is behind Ning Bingqing?

33
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,390
What will Leyao do next?

34
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,910
Jiang Leyao.

35
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,750
Begonia Snow.

36
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,780
=Episode 16=
=To Catch a Tiger in a Jar=

37
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,600
Leyao.

38
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,670
Bingqing, why are you here?

39
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,790
I've just acquired a new sword lately,

40
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,120
but I don't care for it.

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,830
Tell Xiao Jingchu to come see me.

42
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,000
I will give this to him.

43
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,670
(Just thinking of how to tease you.)

44
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,430
(You walked right in yourself.)

45
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,360
Bingqing,

46
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,590
I'm afraid these days,

47
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,390
it's hard to arrange a meeting with him.

48
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,310
He's been quite close to a young lady lately,

49
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,030
but I don't know who she is yet.

50
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,830
Why are there women's clothes in Xiao Manor?

51
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,880
Speak.

52
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,990
Bingqing, please don't be upset.

53
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,390
That young lady must not know

54
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,430
you have feelings for Lord Xiao.

55
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,590
If she knew,

56
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,030
she wouldn't dare compete with you.

57
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,320
Miss, what are you up to now?

58
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,630
To truly wound,
it's not just harm but the heart.

59
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,870
Ning Bingqing values dignity above all.

60
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,390
She is the most noble of all.

61
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,110
Then I'll lift her to the skies,

62
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,150
only to let her fall hard,

63
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,150
and watch her plunge into despair.

64
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,550
But Lord Xiao

65
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,590
always seems distant with you.

66
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,030
Others may not notice,

67
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,950
so it's understandable.

68
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,560
What do you have in mind?

69
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,950
Bingqing, lately,

70
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,430
didn't you just finish "Women's Conduct"?

71
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,390
We can host a banquet to celebrate.

72
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,950
At that event,

73
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,950
just give Lord Xiao

74
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,230
a chance to show himself.

75
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,430
Then everyone will see his feelings.

76
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,320
Wang Yan.

77
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,110
My Lord,

78
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,870
check all my doors

79
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,550
and windows.

80
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,520
My Lord.

81
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,860
Shall we just renovate

82
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,130
the whole residence?

83
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,070
This way, when Miss Jiang visits again,

84
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,350
she won't find anything shabby.

85
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,760
You make a fair point.

86
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,510
Starting tomorrow,

87
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,590
have my residence thoroughly

88
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,030
renovated from top to bottom.

89
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,080
Yes.

90
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,400
Miss Jiang,

91
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,360
what brings you here?

92
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,670
I could've fetched you from Ning Manor.

93
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,510
Actually, I have a favor to ask.

94
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:41,740
Of course.

95
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,670
Go to East Street and buy a necklace.

96
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,150
All right.

97
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,010
Tonight,

98
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,830
if Ning Bingqing asks,
just say you didn't buy it.

99
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,790
Understood.

100
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,270
You don't even ask

101
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,470
what it's for?

102
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,040
I'll follow your lead.

103
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,600
Whatever you say, I'll do.

104
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,390
So obedient, aren't you?

105
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,390
Close your eyes.

106
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,870
Remember, don't change clothes.

107
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,190
I'll check
when you visit the Ning Manor this afternoon.

108
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,870
These are my newly made clothes.

109
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,200
I haven't worn them yet.

110
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,070
Xiao Jingchu is the lucky one.

111
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,950
He gets to see my beauty first.

112
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,390
Later, wear the necklace Lord Xiao gave you.

113
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,790
It'll surely catch his eye.

114
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,240
But still,

115
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,990
why do you think he bought the necklace?

116
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,430
Why not give it at tomorrow's feast?

117
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,750
Why send it today?

118
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,190
Bingqing, in name,

119
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,610
you are the future Crown Princess.

120
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,520
His sister-in-law.

121
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,270
Of course he must be cautious.

122
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,440
You may leave now.

123
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,390
Where's the necklace you got me?

124
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,870
Show me. Is it ugly or not?

125
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,510
What necklace?

126
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,830
Then help me put it on.

127
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,230
I'm busy with official work.

128
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,430
No time to play along.

129
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,920
If you like it,

130
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,510
you can get one yourself.

131
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,390
What do you think, Bingqing?

132
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,990
There's a lipstick mark on him.

133
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,750
What? How could that be?

134
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,750
Would she really dare do that?

135
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,230
I want to see for myself,

136
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,070
what that vixen looks like.

137
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,110
Miss, where are you off to?

138
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,950
Changing clothes.

139
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,630
Heading to East Street.

140
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,150
To act like a vixen.

141
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,200
Hold me.

142
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,590
Let me see for myself.

143
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,030
Are you following me?

144
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,560
No.

145
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,870
I just happened to notice.

146
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,230
It's none of your business

147
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,430
whom I'm with.

148
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:57,560
I...

149
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,330
Stop coveting what isn't yours.

150
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,150
You need not seek me out.

151
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,630
At tomorrow's banquet,

152
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,030
I'll come to you myself.

153
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,110
Once you find that person,

154
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,230
what will you do next?

155
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,110
I'll make her wish she'd never lived.

156
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,540
But if you doubt all women,

157
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,520
why not suspect me as well?

158
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,920
Why would he notice a village girl?

159
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,950
Let me show you

160
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,830
how you

161
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,870
lost to me, a simple village girl.

162
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,080
Bingqing,

163
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,560
I'm here now.

164
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,000
Leave me alone.

165
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,870
Can't you see I'm busy?

166
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,590
Bingqing, listen,

167
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,040
I've come

168
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,320
