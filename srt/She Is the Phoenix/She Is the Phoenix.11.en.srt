=She Is the Phoenix=

11
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,750
Lord Xiao, what brings her here

12
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,070
at this late hour?

13
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,950
Do you know what you're doing?

14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,280
Ning Bingqing

15
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,630
is not just the Duke Ning's daughter.

16
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,230
She's also the future Crown Princess,

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,470
favored by the Empress Dowager.

18
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,590
This is my own affair.

19
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,510
It does not concern you.

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,920
Did you mean it?

21
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,560
In your eyes,

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,070
we're just strangers, aren't we?

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,440
Or what?

24
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,110
We only use each other.

25
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,550
Use?

26
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,400
Jiang Leyao,

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,210
do you even have a heart?

28
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,480
You were the one

29
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,830
who approached me first.

30
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,350
Now that you've drawn me in,

31
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,550
you just walk away?

32
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,630
Can you really feel nothing at all?

33
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,790
Are you truly

34
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,190
going to cut ties with me?

35
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,990
We were partners, nothing more.

36
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,670
Now, we owe each other nothing.

37
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,990
From now on, let's each go our way.

38
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,030
May we not meet again.

39
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,140
=Episode 11=
=Two Ladies=

40
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,390
Both of us are ladies of Ning Family.

41
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,090
Don't you wish

42
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,470
you had what I have now?

43
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,440
You know my background well.

44
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,590
Even if I'm called a lady of Ning Family,

45
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,060
deep down,

46
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,590
I'm still just a village girl.

47
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,430
How hard could it be
to truly become a noble lady?

48
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,510
You're truly a beauty in the making.

49
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,630
It's a shame to keep you as a maid.

50
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,720
But I...

51
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,830
All I know is serving others.

52
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,950
That's exactly what I need.

53
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,590
Look, we resemble each other so much.

54
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,190
Bingqing, please don't tease me.

55
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,990
How could I compare to you?

56
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,670
I'm only fit to serve you.

57
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,630
I already have plenty of maids
by my side.

58
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,310
But I need someone who can take my place.

59
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,310
Starting tomorrow,

60
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,990
you'll eat and live with me from now on.

61
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,750
You must strive to become like me.

62
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,190
Do you understand?

63
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,230
Your left shoulder is higher.

64
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,070
Your legs are not the same size.

65
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,830
Even your waistline isn't ideal.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,550
No one in this world

67
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,750
has perfect proportions.

68
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,390
What are you doing?

69
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,720
Wait just a moment.

70
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,630
Lady Bingqing went through this too.

71
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,990
My Lady, you must stay strong.

72
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,080
I...

73
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,510
Do you think those noble ladies

74
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,150
are admired only for their birth?

75
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,510
If they never faced all this,

76
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,910
how would they differ from common women?

77
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,230
Aristocratic Families value such things.

78
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,710
But what if they do?

79
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,030
After being married off,

80
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,150
aren't they still trapped
in the courtyard?

81
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,750
After all that hardship,

82
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,350
most women are frail, prone to illness.

83
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,070
Childbirth is like passing death's gate.

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,110
Too weak to lift or carry.

85
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,910
If their husband's family grows distant,

86
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,470
how can they survive on their own?

87
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,070
Yet, this is a woman's lot.

88
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,430
So, to avoid being cast aside,

89
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,930
they learn how to please others.

90
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,310
My Lord, shall we take a walk outside?

91
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,950
News from Ning Manor.

92
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,530
Miss Jiang underwent tendon stretching.

93
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,930
She's been bedridden for two days.

94
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,470
It's truly pitiful.

95
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,030
Her troubles have nothing to do with me.

96
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,600
This reward is yours.

97
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,350
Stubborn as ever.

98
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,990
How could I deserve such a fine gift?

99
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,030
This healing salve is truly rare,

100
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,710
as if an imperial prescription.

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,950
Apply it once,

102
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,790
and you'll heal right away.

103
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,110
Where did you get this medicine?

104
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,270
A friend back home.

105
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,670
At last, you've become me.

106
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,230
Bingqing, your hands are skillful.

107
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,390
We look like twins.

108
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,950
Fake is still fake.

109
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,430
How could it be real?

110
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,670
You've misunderstood.

111
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,750
I'm not even one-tenth of you.

112
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,510
I'm just imitating you.

113
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,910
A lowly thing can never replace me.

114
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,550
Let me tell you,

115
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,470
Ning Family can't do without me.

116
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,030
Nor can they live without me.

117
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,010
You are nothing

118
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,390
but a substitute I found.

119
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,310
Just a commoner.

120
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,150
Father said I must be pure

121
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,390
to be a paragon among noble ladies.

122
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,350
I won't let Father down.

123
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,150
(She's the noble lady of Ning Family.)

124
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,870
(Why is she so unsettled,)

125
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,990
(always anxious?)

126
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,590
(Who are these "they" she mentioned?)

127
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,270
(Could it be those masked ones?)

128
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,710
(I must move faster now.)

129
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,230
Lady Bingqing, don't get upset.

130
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,430
No matter how hard Lady Leyao tries,

131
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,660
she can't escape her rural airs.

132
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,100
But Father said,

133
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,300
she's pure.

134
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,580
A little maidservant in her teens.

135
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,980
That's what she's got.

136
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,980
Stick out your tongue.

137
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,220
I can't stand people who are pure.

138
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,940
I have to ruin her.

139
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,090
I must destroy her.
