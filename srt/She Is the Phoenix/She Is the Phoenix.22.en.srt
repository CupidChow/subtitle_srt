May Your Majesty and Your Highness
judge with wisdom.

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,670
This young woman
has shamed her name and ours.

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,590
No one in the Ning Family
had any knowledge of this.

14
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,470
The Crown Princess consorted
with a wanted man.

15
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,950
It would implicate hundreds of the Nings.

16
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,760
I...

17
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,310
I was forced to do this.

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,710
Bingqing, is this true?

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,070
I beg you to see justice done.

20
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,550
I... I had no choice.

21
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,750
Bring that guilty man here.

22
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,110
The Crown Princess said

23
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,470
you all acted of your own will.

24
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,360
Is that so?

25
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,550
Will you defy the edict?

26
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,440
Seize them.

27
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,710
What are you doing?

28
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,830
What are you doing?
Are you rebelling?

29
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,270
Sir, perhaps you haven't heard,

30
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,310
Qiao Ping, who was thought dead, is alive.

31
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,030
Miss Jiang's accusation of murder

32
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,950
doesn't stand at all.

33
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,080
Nonsense.

34
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,320
How could that be?

35
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,600
I clearly...

36
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,910
Maybe it was all a mistake.

37
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,590
Let me go back and check first.

38
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,870
If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave.

39
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,750
Take them away.

40
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,960
What are you doing?

41
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,510
I am an imperial official.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,990
You colluded with the Ning Family,
causing harm.

43
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,830
You are the one I must arrest.

44
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,480
Take him away.

45
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,560
- You...
- Move.

46
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,150
Let go of me.

47
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,710
You dare defy the imperial order.

48
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,490
Release me.

49
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,110
Let me go now.

50
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,280
Leyao.

51
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,430
Let's go home.

52
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,190
This farce should end now.

53
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,760
No need to rush.

54
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,350
I'll wait right here.

55
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,590
I'll wait for her to come.

56
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,620
=Episode 22=
=The Wager=

57
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,270
It was I who forced Lady Bingqing.

58
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,070
You may punish me as you see fit.

59
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,190
You wretched.

60
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,680
Guards!

61
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,990
Take him to the Eastern Palace.

62
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,360
Jingyou,

63
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,030
though your feelings
for Ning Bingqing run deep,

64
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,990
you must not disregard
the royal family's honor.

65
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,270
Besides, the child she carries

66
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,110
might not be our blood.

67
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,950
That remains uncertain.

68
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,320
Your marriage

69
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,230
must be called off.

70
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,270
As for Ning Bingqing,

71
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,150
send her to the Hall of Penitence to reflect.

72
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,590
I understand, Grandmother.

73
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,310
A respectful farewell to the Empress Dowager.

74
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,310
A respectful farewell to the Crown Prince.

75
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,590
I've truly spoiled you too much.

76
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,030
Have you forgotten

77
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,670
the Ning Family never keeps a useless lady?

78
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,720
Father,

79
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,600
I was wrong.

80
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,790
Please forgive me, Father.

81
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,510
From model noble lady to fallen woman.

82
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,350
Tell me,
what can you do for the Ning Family now?

83
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,290
Father,

84
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,470
if you forgive me, I can do anything,

85
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,670
anything at all, Father.

86
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,230
We've truly angered the Crown Prince
because of you.

87
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,990
Now, only Lord Sun,

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,910
a minister holding command
of the armed forces,

89
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,430
can save us.

90
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,110
Though he is advanced in age,

91
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,070
his health is still strong.

92
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,430
If you serve him well,

93
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,710
the Ning Family will be safe.

94
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,200
Do you understand?

95
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,750
Please do not worry, Father.

96
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,270
I promise I will not let you down.

97
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,630
That's the lady the Ning Family needs.

98
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,830
Lord Sun is fond of married woman,

99
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,790
and you are with child.

100
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,110
He will surely treat you with extra care.

101
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,630
Alright.

102
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,110
Let's go. I'll escort you myself.

103
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,440
Lord Ning.

104
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,030
Seize them.

105
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,880
How dare you!

106
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,550
Who do you think you are?

107
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,630
You dare arrest people in my home?

108
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,890
(Token)
I act on orders to arrest

109
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,710
Ning Bingqing,
the mastermind of Begonia Snow.

110
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,110
(Token)
Lord Ning, will you interfere?

111
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,870
Father, help me.

112
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,880
Take her away.

113
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,190
Let go! Father.

114
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,270
Don't leave me behind.

115
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,340
I'll do anything you ask.

116
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,530
I swear, I'll do anything.

117
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,280
Father!

118
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,950
Father, save me!

119
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,560
Hurry, move!

120
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,030
How dare you order me around!

121
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,270
In Xuanyin Division, status means nothing.

122
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,230
You're all just prisoners.

123
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,410
Move!

124
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,950
We meet again.

125
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,710
Sooner than I expected.

126
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,670
If not for that accident,

127
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,150
do you think you'd see me now?

128
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,470
An accident?

129
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,870
Trust me,

130
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,990
I will make things right for you.

131
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,910
Ning Bingqing

132
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,230
is not someone who waits for fate.

133
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,790
So we must be even more careful.

134
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,870
The witness in Nanny Zhao's case

135
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,510
appeared far too conveniently.

136
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,040
We can't let our guard down.

137
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,150
This is the trap she's set for me.

138
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,990
She's using Qiao Ping as bait.

139
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,990
Her aim is to ruin you forever.

140
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,350
So,

141
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,750
we can only turn their plan against them.

142
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,070
You wanted to use his fake death
to get rid of me,

143
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,750
and let him escape the wanted notice.

144
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,310
One move with two gains.

145
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,950
As for me,

146
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,910
I just went along with it.

147
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,870
I gave him a slight cut.

148
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,190
I knew, with his feelings for you,

149
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,790
on your wedding day,

150
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,390
he would surely come to say farewell.

151
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,870
So I ordered someone

152
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,990
to slip into your room,

153
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,750
and secretly light Joy Incense.

154
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,160
Wretched woman.

155
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,580
Wretched woman!

156
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,550
Aren't you worried
all this anger is bad for your baby?

157
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,470
You still don't know, do you?

158
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,150
There's nothing in your belly,

159
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,910
no child at all.

160
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,680
Tricked me again.

161
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,070
I'll end you right here.

162
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,040
I'll end you right now!

163
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,470
What makes you think you can?

164
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,230
Ning Bingqing.

165
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,950
If anyone's to strike,

166
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,830
it should be me ending you.

167
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,070
You've beaten and scolded servants,

168
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,630
sent blameless women to Begonia Snow,

169
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,350
and burned Jiang Family Village.

170
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,030
How much blood stains your hands?

171
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,070
When night falls and dreams return,

172
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,390
do no souls come for justice?

173
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,670
I am a noble lady.

174
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,470
Why would commoners

175
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,070
ever dare seek vengeance on me?

176
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,750
All lives are born equal.

177
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,110
Who says some are above others?

178
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,990
You claim to be a noble lady,

179
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,350
yet show no mercy, no conscience.

180
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,030
Jiang Leyao, do you want to uphold justice?

181
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,510
Too bad, you're just not enough.

182
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,430
I have the Ning Family behind me.

183
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,790
My father will surely come for me.

184
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,950
Wake up, will you.

185
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,710
You're nothing more than

186
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,390
a tool for Duke Ning
to cling to the powerful.

187
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,710
When a tool loses value,

188
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,230
it's bound to be thrown away.

189
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,080
Shut up!

190
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,470
Let me tell you this:

191
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,470
Ning Family can't do without me.

192
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,670
He will come and get me out.

193
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,310
Once I'm free,

194
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,510
I'll tear you to pieces.

195
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,360
Very well.

196
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,270
Let's make a wager then.

197
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,550
Let's see who falls first,

198
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,070
you or me.
