=She Is the Phoenix=

11
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,190
She is truly beautiful.

12
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,150
I heard she's the Madam Leyao
of Ning Family.

13
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,750
- Ning Family is the top in the Capital.
- Father.

14
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,260
(Duke Ning, Ning Family)
Jiang Leyao,

15
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,510
you're the Young Madam of Ning Family.

16
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,870
How dare you secretly meet another man?

17
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,510
You've brought shame to our family.

18
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,350
Your actions are simply unforgivable.

19
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,990
Father.

20
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,590
I have been wrongly accused!

21
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,710
You were quite unruly last night.

22
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:38,590
We've all heard about what happened.

23
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,500
No, I've been wrongly accused.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,810
Truly, I'm innocent.

25
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,750
Father, one day I will be Empress.

26
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,570
With this,
how can I face the Crown Prince?

27
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,880
- I'm innocent.
- Guards!

28
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,730
Here.

29
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,350
Rong'er, Rong'er.

30
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,790
Rong'er, you were with me at that time.

31
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,270
You know the truth.

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,570
Tell them what really happened.

33
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,470
Please, tell them I'm innocent.

34
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,990
Madam Leyao, you told me

35
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,670
you had a secret meeting
and sent me away.

36
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,870
Jiang Leyao, the evidence is clear now.

37
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,710
What do you have to say for yourself?

38
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,670
Guards.

39
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,840
Carry out family discipline.

40
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,210
Father, Father, Father.

41
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,070
Father.

42
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,210
Father.

43
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,950
Father.

44
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,290
Father.

45
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,770
Father.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,100
My father and mother

47
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,750
kindly took you in,

48
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,070
and cared for you all these years.

49
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,290
I treated you like my own sister.

50
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,110
Why?

51
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,950
Why would you do this to me?

52
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,630
You only gave me food to survive.

53
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,270
Did you think I'd be like you,

54
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,270
living a hard life forever?

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,550
The Noble Lord told me,

56
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,550
if I burn your whole village,

57
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,830
I'd gain a life of wealth and honor.

58
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,700
That fire...

59
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,450
That fire

60
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,590
was set by you, wasn't it?

61
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,870
You set the fire!

62
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,550
But you're still alive.

63
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,520
You...

64
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,510
You even became
the Young Madam of Ning Family.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,190
That's not fair to me.

66
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,790
Why? Why is it so?

67
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,870
Why?

68
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,960
My parents

69
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,270
treated you so kindly.

70
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,390
Why?

71
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,790
Who is truly behind you?

72
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,310
Even if you know, what could you do?

73
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,030
An ant can't shake a tree.

74
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,750
Commoners can't fight the powerful.

75
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,950
No matter how you struggle,

76
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,470
you're still like meat,

77
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,700
waiting to be carved up.

78
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,950
Go to hell!

79
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,130
Jiang Leyao met with a man in secret,

80
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,270
bringing shame to Ning Family.

81
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,990
She's overwhelmed with guilt

82
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,600
and took her own life.

83
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,630
Anyway, your legs are broken by me.

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,840
Just stay here.

85
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,430
Wait for the fire to claim you alive.

86
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,150
I won't let you get away with this.

87
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,430
(The Phoenix falls into the abyss,)
Yet reborn in the Fires of Nirvana.

88
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,270
(Tempered by the Fires,)
Her fate may be changed.

89
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,380
=Episode 1=
=Rebirth=

90
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,190
Didn't I die in the fire?

91
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,230
This is my birthday gift from Mother.

92
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,470
Did I return to a month ago?

93
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,520
Honey, hurry up.

94
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,940
Quick, give it to Leyao.

95
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,710
Hmm? What is it?

96
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,030
What do you mean?

97
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,590
Mother, what exactly is it?

98
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,950
Happy birthday.

99
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,850
(Rong'er will set the village on fire
at Wu Hour.)

100
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,310
(It shouldn't be Wu Hour yet.)

101
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,390
(There's still time.)

102
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,630
Mother, it's too plain.

103
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,420
I don't like it. Return it.

104
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,190
But the vendor said,

105
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,710
she wasn't sure which girl it was,

106
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,190
but someone kept coming
to see this hairpin.

107
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,320
That's right.

108
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,190
And she also mentioned, once sold,

109
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,430
no refunds or exchanges.

110
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:31,810
Father.

111
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,950
Come, let me put it on for you.

112
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,510
Today is your birthday.

113
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,990
Rong'er is nowhere to be found.

114
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,590
Could she be hiding somewhere

115
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,910
just to surprise you?

116
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,710
Mother, you and Father eat first.

117
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,650
I'll go look for her.

118
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,230
I want her to see my hairpin first.

119
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,120
This child, not even eating.

120
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,800
Leyao, don't run so fast.

121
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,800
(Father, Mother, villagers,)

122
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,380
(this time, I will save you all.)

123
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,840
Father, Mother!

124
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:41,450
Mother, Father, Mother!

125
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,800
(Something's off.)

126
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,630
(Chang Rong'er confessed
to setting the fire.)

127
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,070
(It's not yet Wu Hour.
Why did the fire start early?)

128
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,030
(Could she have been reborn too?)

129
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,040
(Heaven truly favors me,)

130
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,670
(letting me live once more.)

131
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,750
I've set the village ablaze.

132
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,630
I wonder, Noble Lords,
are you satisfied?

133
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,870
Well done. Here is your reward.

134
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,110
(I indeed turned back in time.)

135
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,350
(It seems fate knows it wronged me)

136
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,690
(and sent me back in time.)

137
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,350
(This time,)

138
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,670
(I will figure out who killed me)

139
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,110
(and claim all that I desire.)

140
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,770
Let's keep a bit more,
then I must return it.

141
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,980
If my mother finds out,
I'll be in trouble.

142
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,410
Mmm.

143
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,310
(So it really is her.)

144
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,910
(Once again, it was too late.)

145
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,590
(She set the fire early
and took the jade pendant.)

146
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,590
(She wants to use my identity
to marry into Ning Family.)

147
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,470
(Chang Rong'er, you wish.)

148
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,550
Step aside!

149
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,070
Ruyi House used gambling
as a cover for fraud.

150
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,830
You colluded with the Black Bank
to transfer silver notes.

151
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,140
I acted alone.

152
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,430
I admit my fault, My Lord.
Please show mercy.

153
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,950
It seems
you don't truly regret your deeds.

154
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:24,860
All you need to know is,
your end is near.

155
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,580
(Ning Manor)

156
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,830
Back when Old Master Ning
was near death,

157
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,920
my grandfather risked his life
to save him.

158
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,070
That's why Ning Family thrives today.

159
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,330
Will the Nings acknowledge
this jade pendant?

160
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,240
And will you accept
this marriage arrangement?

161
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,030
Miss, please wait here.

162
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,740
(Ning Manor)

163
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,790
(This time,)

164
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,630
(the position of Young Madam is mine.)

165
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,990
Chang Rong'er!

166
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,110
