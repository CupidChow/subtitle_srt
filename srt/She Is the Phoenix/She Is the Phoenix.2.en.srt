11
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,470
Take them to Xuanyin Division
for questioning.

12
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,510
If they keep silent,

13
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,510
then

14
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,350
pull their teeth out one by one.

15
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,270
- Take him away.
- Move.

16
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,110
Move.

17
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,910
My Lord, someone used a silver note

18
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,140
from the Black Bank
to buy clothes yesterday.

19
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,380
Where is this person?

20
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,620
Her name is Rong'er.

21
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,560
She's in the Ning Manor.

22
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:17,940
My Lord.

23
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,540
Ning Family is the top in the Capital.

24
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,660
Should we notify Duke Ning first?

25
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,740
The Xuanyin Division is on duty.

26
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,580
Anyone who blocks us will pay dearly.

27
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,940
=Episode 2=
=Entering the Manor=

28
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,460
(Ning Manor)

29
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,860
Back when Old Master Ning
was near death,

30
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,940
my grandfather risked his life
to save him.

31
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,100
That's why Ning Family thrives today.

32
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,410
Will the Nings acknowledge
this jade pendant?

33
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,170
And will you accept
this marriage arrangement?

34
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,060
Miss, please wait here.

35
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,260
(This time,)

36
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,100
(the position of Young Madam is mine.)

37
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,460
Chang Rong'er!

38
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,580
Why did you hit me?

39
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,740
At last, I've caught you.

40
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,180
(Why wasn't she burned in the village?)

41
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,690
(I meant to
marry into Ning Family in her place.)

42
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,820
(What should I do now?)

43
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,580
You...

44
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,980
So you knew all along.

45
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,330
What do you think I should know?

46
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,460
The Jiangs have always treated me well.

47
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,340
Father and Mother loved me as their own.

48
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,060
Who would have thought
they'd perish in a fire...

49
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,980
I grieved so deeply.

50
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,260
You were so heartbroken

51
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,460
that you took my jade pendant
and married in my place.

52
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,860
(Looks like she knows nothing.)

53
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,220
(She's here for the pendant.)

54
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,260
Yes, I took the jade pendant.

55
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,860
You dare admit it so easily.

56
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,660
That pendant was your mother's keepsake.

57
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,060
I only took it because...

58
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,040
the Second Young Master
of Ning Family is retarded

59
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,120
(Ning Manor)
and violent.

60
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,500
You were like a real sister to me.

61
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,180
How could I bear
to see you suffer there?

62
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,820
(Playing sisterly love, huh?
I'll play along.)

63
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,460
So you took the jade pendant,

64
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,380
hoping to marry into Ning Family
in my stead.

65
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,860
For your sake, I'd do anything.

66
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,180
Rong'er, such deep kindness,

67
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,260
I'll repay you with all my heart.

68
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,060
(Ning Manor)

69
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,300
The Duke said the pendant is genuine.

70
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,190
But the masters have left
to visit their kin.

71
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,140
They don't have time,

72
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,040
so I will oversee things for now.

73
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,680
Everyone, prepare to welcome the bride.

74
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,260
Welcome.

75
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,660
Rong'er,

76
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,260
I've heard Ning Manor is a grand place,

77
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,420
with dangers lurking.

78
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,420
I can't bear to let you

79
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,500
face it alone.

80
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,340
Why not let me be your maid?

81
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,580
So I can protect you.

82
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,460
(Last life, you were the madam,
I the maid.)

83
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,540
(This time, let me step on you instead.)

84
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,500
Then you must listen to me, Leyao.

85
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,900
Don't worry, Leyao.

86
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,140
I'll serve you well, I promise.

87
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,280
(Since I have this second chance,)

88
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,020
(I'll uncover who's behind Rong'er,)

89
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,660
(who ordered her to set the fire.)

90
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,620
An ant can't shake a tree.

91
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,620
Commoners can't fight the powerful.

92
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,900
No matter how you struggle,

93
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,220
you're still like meat,

94
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,820
waiting to be carved up.

95
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,220
Break her legs!

96
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,340
(I want all these fiends of Ning Manor)

97
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,540
(to pay for the blood they've spilled.)

98
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,660
(The Nings only care for status.)

99
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,130
(So I used the silver note
from the Noble Lord)

100
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,340
(to buy myself new clothes.)

101
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,700
You may stay here for now.

102
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,780
All formalities await the Duke's return.

103
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,060
Chang Rong'er.

104
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,740
You're suspected of a gambling case.

105
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,530
(Ning Manor)
Xuanyin Division summons you.

106
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,180
What gambling? What Xuanyin Division?

107
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,980
I did nothing. You can't arrest me.

108
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,380
(Token)

109
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,620
Another stubborn one.

110
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,980
Take her away.

111
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,620
(It's him, Reaper Yanluo, Xiao Jingchu.)

112
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,220
Careful.

113
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,940
You're the one who should be careful.

114
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,100
(If Rong'er is taken away,)

115
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,180
(I'll lose my only lead.)

116
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,340
(I'll never avenge my parents.)

117
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,140
You have no proof.

118
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,620
Why did you arrest my sister?

119
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,460
We owe no explanations to anyone.

120
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,740
Step aside.

121
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,570
My Lord,

122
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,450
Rong'er is...

123
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,140
Since she's the Young Madam
of Ning Family,

124
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,100
I can let her go,

125
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,850
but you dared defy me.

126
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,860
If you want to reclaim this,

127
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:54,260
come to Xuanyin Division tonight
for questioning.

128
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,260
Withdraw.

129
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,460
Rong'er.

130
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,100
Now I'm the Madam, and you're a servant.

131
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,900
Don't you know how to address me?

132
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,220
Madam Rong'er.

133
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,030
Madam Rong'er, please have some tea.

134
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,700
Go dig up that flower pot.

135
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,700
Jiang Leyao, how dare you.

136
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,820
You stole Madam's favorite golden hairpin.

137
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,720
I...

138
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,250
Nanny, I truly don't know.

139
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,800
Nanny, I really have no idea.

140
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,260
Bring out the family discipline!

141
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,900
Nanny, I swear I'm innocent, Nanny.

142
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:28,030
Nanny, I did nothing wrong, Nanny!

143
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,220
Rong'er,

144
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,940
how did you know
a golden hairpin was there?

145
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,150
Don't worry about it.

146
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,610
It's all that old woman's doing.

147
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,940
She wants to frame me for theft,

148
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,490
so that she can throw me out

149
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,620
before the Duke returns.

150
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,720
So what should we do now?

151
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,970
(I'm not like you,)

152
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,470
(always letting others walk over you.)

153
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,740
You sneak this golden hairpin

154
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,800
into that old woman's room.

155
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,450
We'll turn her own trick against her.

156
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,770
Then hurry back to the Xuanyin Division.

157
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,700
Mind your words over there.

158
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,560
Don't get that scary one riled up again.

159
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,370
Understood, Rong'er.

160
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,210
(Rong'er, oh Rong'er.)

161
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,480
(This hairpin)

162
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,660
