=She Is the Phoenix=

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,210
- My Lady.
- Kneel.

12
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,750
What's wrong, My Lady?

13
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,030
I am mistress, you are servant.

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,910
I tell you to kneel, so you must obey.

15
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,190
I once thought we were like sisters,

16
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,190
so I always planned on your behalf.

17
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,070
But in your eyes,

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,190
I am nothing but a servant.

19
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,910
What are you, really?

20
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,850
You think you're worthy to be my sister?

21
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,350
Nanny Qi's son, Li Yong,

22
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,390
used Master Tao's name

23
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,270
to run an illegal gambling den.

24
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,910
There are countless victims.

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,150
Just for this alone,

26
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,510
you could bring down Nanny Qi.

27
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,070
Old woman, your days are numbered.

28
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,190
It hurts!

29
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,410
I said, it hurts.

30
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,590
I said it hurts, do you hear me?

31
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,790
Go around her, just avoid her.

32
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,420
Madam Rong'er,
you truly command respect.

33
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,750
My best days are yet to come.

34
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,470
Pity you won't get to see them.

35
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,430
We'll see about that.

36
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,670
Let's see who holds the power
in the Second Courtyard.

37
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,230
Send my orders down.

38
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,350
I'm hosting a Peony Banquet.

39
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,310
To welcome
Young Lady Ning Bingqing home.

40
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,510
The illegal gambling den.

41
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,070
Plus, she's angered Lady Bingqing.

42
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,430
Let's see how she deals with all this.

43
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,240
Yes.

44
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,580
Father.

45
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,950
One day, I shall be Empress.

46
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,830
With this,
how can I face the Crown Prince?

47
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,710
(Future Crown Princess,)

48
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,910
(paragon praised by the Empress Dowager,)

49
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,910
(Ning Bingqing.)

50
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,230
(Everyone has finally arrived.)

51
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,180
=Episode 6=
=Seeking One's Kin=

52
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,640
My Lord.

53
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,310
Lady Bingqing of Ning Family

54
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,630
has just returned home.

55
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,610
She's holding a banquet.

56
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,820
Here's the invitation.

57
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,520
I don't have time.

58
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,070
I'll decline.

59
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,720
By the way,

60
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,070
Miss Jiang has sent a letter.

61
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,390
Since it's a show worth seeing,

62
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,640
I won't miss it.

63
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,170
Leave the invitation here.

64
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,030
So you're not busy at all.

65
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,430
You're the idle one.

66
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,390
Sort out all the cases

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,230
cases related to Ruyi House

68
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,590
over the past three years.

69
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,950
Yes, My Lord.

70
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,790
(Ning Manor)
I'm Madam Rong'er.

71
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,350
Lady Bingqing, welcome home.

72
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,950
Lady Bingqing, nice to see you again.

73
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,470
(They've known each other long.)

74
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,950
You truly are skilled.

75
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,830
Thank you for your praise.

76
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,070
Your journey must have been tiring.

77
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,510
I've prepared a Peony Banquet for you.

78
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,950
Please honor us with your presence.

79
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,960
Are you expecting me?

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,110
Lord Xiao.

81
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,390
I thought you wouldn't come, My Lord.

82
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,830
Why miss a good show?

83
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,670
Especially when you set the stage.

84
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,950
Rest assured, you won't be let down.

85
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,640
Very well.

86
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,350
This Peony Banquet is quite well done.

87
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,310
Bingqing is weary from travel,
so she won't join.

88
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,510
You see to the guests.

89
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,430
Thank you for your praise.

90
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,390
I will...

91
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,240
Your Grace.

92
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,150
Madam Rong'er has never hosted before.

93
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,190
She may not receive everyone well.

94
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,910
Why not let me handle it?

95
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,520
That could work.

96
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,790
No need to rush, Nanny Qi.

97
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,790
You may not get the chance today.

98
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,670
Please, Your Grace, grant me justice.

99
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,610
Help me, I beg you.

100
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,550
Your Grace.

101
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,550
I want to accuse Master Tao.

102
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,410
He opened an illegal gambling den,

103
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,330
causing my family's ruin.

104
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,310
Please, Your Grace, grant me justice.

105
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,190
Everyone,

106
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,030
this concerns the honor of Ning Family.

107
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,350
I will see this matter investigated.

108
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,070
Take them away for now.

109
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,430
Settle them properly.

110
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,790
Didn't expect Miss Jiang to hand us

111
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,710
such a vital clue.

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,590
Turns out Li Yong is one of the owners

113
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,270
of Ruyi House.

114
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,230
It gets more interesting.

115
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,440
Hold on.

116
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,830
Since this involves a murder case,

117
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,070
it's no longer just a family affair.

118
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,110
If you have any proof,

119
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,320
present it now,

120
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,470
so the Duke may see for himself.

121
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,030
(So, your presence at the banquet)

122
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,870
(wasn't just to watch the show, was it?)

123
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,870
Your Grace, see the truth.

124
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,150
Li Yong from Ruyi House

125
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,630
brought Ning Manor's guards along,

126
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,270
and used my family's female members

127
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,230
as collateral.

128
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,590
To this day, their fate is unknown.

129
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,430
Please, grant us justice.

130
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,270
Spare me, Your Grace!

131
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,470
It was all me. I was tempted by money.

132
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,350
My son only acted on my orders.

133
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,070
Please forgive me, Your Grace.

134
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,870
Your Grace,
this concerns your reputation.

135
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,950
Such rot must be dealt with firmly.

136
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,240
Guards!

137
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,950
Take Qi Zhen away and beat him to death.

138
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,390
Let justice be served.

139
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,870
Your Grace!

140
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,590
You don't need to, Your Grace.

141
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,360
Guards.

142
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,070
Take them back to the Xuanyin.

143
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,400
Wait.

144
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,510
Qi Zhen is my servant.

145
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,070
This is against the rules, right?

146
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,600
Rules?

147
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,910
Xuanyin Division sets the rules.
Take them.

148
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,390
Your Grace, the guests are still here.

149
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,390
Why not let me I entertain our guests?

150
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,950
(It seems you've raised your true rival)

151
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,470
(to such a high position.)

152
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,870
(The higher she stands,
the harder she falls.)

153
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,950
Thank you all for attending the banquet.

154
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,470
Now, please...

155
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,710
How unfilial you are!

156
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,950
Do you even recognize your own father?

157
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,150
