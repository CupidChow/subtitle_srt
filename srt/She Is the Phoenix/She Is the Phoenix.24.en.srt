11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,640
Xiao Jingchu.

12
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,310
It's your first day on duty today.

13
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,710
I'll take you to Dali Court.

14
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,030
Does it hurt?

15
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,900
It didn't hurt before.

16
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,150
But now that you ask, it does a little.

17
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,670
Don't worry.
I'll look out for you from now on.

18
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,550
Oh dear,

19
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,280
I lost a wife,

20
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,520
but gained someone to rely on.

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,040
I can't tell if Grandmother

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,830
is helping me or punishing me.

23
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,230
Of course she's helping you.

24
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,470
And honestly, she's helping me too.

25
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,600
Alright.

26
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,030
The truth will soon be revealed.

- Go, go.
- Go.

29
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,790
- Bite it, bite it.
- Bite, bite.

30
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,620
Bite it, bite.

31
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,030
- Come on.
- Easy, easy.

32
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,310
Bite it, go on, bite it now.

33
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,630
- Bite, bite.
- Come on.

34
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,510
- Bite.
- Go, go.

35
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,590
Go, go.

36
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,010
Bite, bite, bite.

37
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,030
I am Jiang Leyao.

38
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,870
So you are the Lady Inspector
appointed by Her Majesty.

39
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,270
You're the first female official
of our dynasty.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,840
Welcome.

41
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,120
I'm flattered.

42
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,230
May I ask where I will work?

43
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,150
Let us handle this rough task.

44
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,790
You should just take a rest.

45
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,230
I am paid to serve the court,

46
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,150
and must remain loyal.

47
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,110
The Empress Dowager entrusted me.

48
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,530
How could I think of resting?

49
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,950
But does a woman like you

50
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,530
know how to investigate?

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,840
Oh?

52
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,990
Then are you skilled in investigation?

53
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,230
Lady Liu's been wrongly accused.

54
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,970
Why did you close the case hastily?

55
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,030
You...

56
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,520
And you, sir.

57
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,550
You delayed the Silk Shop theft case

58
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,830
for social calls.

59
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,990
Is that proper?

60
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,240
And as for you,

61
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,430
the maidservant murder case
at Zhao Manor.

62
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,910
The scene was utter chaos.

63
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,030
You muddled the facts,
making careless guesses.

64
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,670
Is this what you call an investigation?

65
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,560
Now,

66
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,200
all of you,

67
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,910
bring me every case file, one by one.

68
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,950
Today, I will review the case myself.

69
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,720
Get back to work.

70
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:40,300
(Case Files)

71
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,990
Those fiends,

72
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,150
it wasn't their first village arson.

73
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,870
If I can find recent records

74
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,270
of all the village arson cases' files,

75
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,630
I'll surely spot a pattern.

76
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,550
(In just half a year,)

77
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,030
(twelve village arson cases
hit the outskirts.)

78
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,830
(All occurred on New Moon
or Full Moon Days.)

79
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,870
(A total of)

80
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,750
(2,731 lives lost.)

81
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,470
(In the end, all were deemed accidents.)

82
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,990
(In three days, it's Full Moon Day.)

83
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,910
You... Why are you here?

84
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,550
I missed you.
Hope you don't mind me sneaking in.

85
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,910
Is Lord Jiang inside?

86
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,790
They already resent me for the order

87
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,640
from Her Majesty.

88
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,110
If they find out you're here,

89
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,190
who knows what they'll say.

90
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,920
Hurry, hide.

91
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,350
Hide? Where can I go?

92
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,270
Be gentle.

93
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,440
Lord Jiang.

94
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,550
Is there something else?

95
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,350
Lord Jiang, you're new here,

96
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,950
so you aren't familiar with these files.

97
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,470
I came to help you on purpose.

98
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,350
Take a look at this.

99
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,460
(Year of Xinchou, January)

100
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,340
Before the New Year...

101
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,950
This...

102
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,800
What's wrong?

103
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,070
It's fine, let's keep going.

104
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,440
There's more here.

105
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:33,910
Look at this one.

106
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,950
In this year...

107
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,910
Lord Jiang, are you alright?

108
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,390
Go fetch me a cup of water.

109
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,150

I'm leaving.

Rascal.

121
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,790
Greetings, Your Majesty.

122
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,520
Leyao.

123
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,670
What brings you to visit me today?

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,430
Is all well at the Dali Court?

125
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,870
Thanks to you, everything is fine.

126
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,270
I trust my own judgment.

127
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,390
The Crown Prince sent word,

128
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,310
he's feeling unwell,

129
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,790
and plans to rest at the outskirts
for three days,

130
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,950
so he won't visit you for now.

131
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,350
Unwell again, is he?

132
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,950
Did he call for the Imperial Physician?

133
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,710
Every time he's ill,
he heads to the outskirts.

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,150
Can that help him recover?

135
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,870
Perhaps he just needs some air.

136
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,110
And he'll bring you

137
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,550
Jing pears when he returns.

138
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,510
Jing pears?

139
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,390
They're said to be fragrant and sweet.

140
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,870
Only the palace
at the outskirts has them.

141
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:21,980
Is that so?

142
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,850
That's right.

143
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,070
No other estate grows Jing pears.

144
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,760
When he returns,

145
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,350
I'll have Jingchu bring you some to try.

146
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,630
Thank you, Your Majesty.

147
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,800
(Crown Prince,)

148
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,350
(It's time to remove your mask.)

149
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,230
I'll give you one last chance.

150
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,710
Is the man behind you

151
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,830
the Crown Prince?

152
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,430
You can't win against him.

153
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,240
Is that so?

154
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,710
Still, I want to try.

155
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,480
Father,

156
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,190
you've lost much weight lately.

157
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,270
Have some soup
to restore your strength.

158
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,510
Thank you for thinking of me.

159
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,590
Now that Rong'er is gone,

160
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,870
the duty regarding our Ning Family

161
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,750
falls to you now.

162
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,680
I know.

163
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,830
Father,

164
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,950
the Crown Prince is the Heir Apparent.

165
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,950
If we don't mend our ties

166
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,110
with the Crown Prince soon,

167
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,070
the days ahead for us

168
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,230
will likely be even harder.

169
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,310
Leyao, what do you think?

170
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,070
Now that our Ning Family
holds no real power,

171
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,230
to win back the Crown Prince's favor,

172
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,270
apart from a marriage alliance,

173
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,630
there's no other way.

174
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,230
You're quite ambitious.

175
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,340
Father,

176
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,150
I only wish to ease your worries.

177
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,150
You truly are a devoted child.

178
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,790
I'll see you enter
the Crown Prince's manor.

179
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,350
Rest assured, Father,

180
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,510
from now on,

181
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,990
I must always put our family
and Father first.

182
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,390
Here, Father.

183
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,400
Have some tea.

184
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,150
(The Crown Prince is thorough,)

185
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,670
(only by stepping in myself,)

186
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,190
(can I find the evidence.)

187
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,110
It's okay, just practice more.

188
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,030
Look.

189
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,390
I heard you're unwell.

190
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,470
Yet you still visit the Ning Family.

191
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,040
And you,

192
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,590
Inspector Jiang,

193
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,330
shouldn't you be at Dali Court?

194
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,190
You seem unhappy about this.

195
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,430
Jingyou,

196
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,480
you may not know

197
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,190
- she and I...
- Lord Xiao.

198
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,870
A woman's reputation matters most.

199
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,030
Besides, I'll soon marry His Highness.

200
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,750
Please choose your words carefully.

201
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,430
What did you say?

202
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,790
Leyao will soon be my concubine.

203
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,870
Jingchu, be sure to come

204
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,670
for the wedding ceremony.

205
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,440
Leyao,

206
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,350
seems there are some misunderstandings.

207
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,560
You should talk it through.

208
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,190
Why this sudden change?

209
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,830
Is there something you can't share?

210
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,710
I'm marrying him
to repay Nings' kindness.

211
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,640
Ning Family?

212
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,450
What kindness did they show you?

213
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,030
Even so,

214
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,110
why didn't you pick me?

215
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,510
I'm a prince too.

216
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,270
But he is the Heir Apparent,
the future Emperor!

217
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,600
Jiang Leyao,

218
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,390
I misjudged you.

219
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,270
What about your dreams?

220
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,670
You're just...

221
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,270
another commoner chasing favor.

222
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,470
Let Beasts Garden know.

223
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,950
There's a newcomer arriving.

224
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,390
(Xiao Jingyou,)

225
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,430
(I've got nothing left to lose.)

226
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,070
