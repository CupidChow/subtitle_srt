11
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,560
My Lord, please return my hairpin.

12
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,670
Xuanyin Division is much worse than hell.

13
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,090
It's just a worn hairpin.

14
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,110
Jiang Leyao, you'd risk your life.

15
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,630
I want my life,
but I want the hairpin too.

16
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,510
I know you never meant to kill me.

17
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,030
Otherwise, at the gates of Ning Manor,

18
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,390
you could've ended me.

19
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,520
You're wrong.

20
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,030
I only wanted to do it here.

21
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,230
Let's see

22
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,800
how you handle this.

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,670
I also know the silver notes

24
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,430
and the Black Bank are tied to the Nings.

25
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,950
But Duke Ning holds great power,

26
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,030
so it's not easy for you to act.

27
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,220
My Lord, if you return my hairpin

28
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,690
and spare my life,

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,030
I'm willing to be your pawn to shake

30
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,390
the Ning Family.

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,470
You're just a maid

32
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,490
yet you dare speak of alliance with me?

33
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,670
You're courting death.

34
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,190
(Rumor has it Xiao Jingchu is celibate.)

35
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,910
(Could it be true?)

36
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,190
As long as you return my hairpin,
My Lord,

37
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,860
I'll do whatever you ask of me.

38
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,550
Rough as sackcloth, thin as a twig,

39
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,470
yet you think I'd fall for you?

40
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,670
(It's said none can leave here alive.)

41
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,790
My Lord, you didn't.

42
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,430
You only...

43
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,870
let emotions stir.

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,840
Nonsense.

45
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,750
I spoke out of turn.

46
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,750
My Lord, urgent news!

47
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,710
Get dressed at once.

48
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,920
Must you really

49
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,390
let others see you like this?

50
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,310
I'm already in your grasp.

51
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,750
If you insist, My Lord,

52
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,950
I have no choice but to obey.

53
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,760
My Lord.

54
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,700
Leave.

55
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,560
Understood.

56
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,060
You protect me so.

57
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm truly grateful.

58
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,090
You...

59
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,400
You leave too.

60
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,390
A fine moment was spoiled.

61
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,180
It truly is unpleasant.

62
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,230
My Lord, if you wish to continue,

63
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,300
come to Ning Manor at Hai hour tonight.

64
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,280
I'll be waiting for you.

65
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,990
(The scented sachet is worn,
yet always carried with.)

66
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,430
(It must be a gift from someone dear.)

67
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,950
(You must come.)

=Countermove=

69
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,070
Rong'er, how bold you are!

70
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,230
You dared steal Madam's golden hairpin.

71
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,730
(I can't wait to see you
turn on each other.)

72
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,580
Nonsense.

73
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,900
What proof do you have

74
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,060
that I stole it?

75
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,500
I could say you took it instead.

76
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,980
You stubborn girl, stop talking back.

77
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,780
Let's see how I deal with you
when I find it.

78
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,060
Search!

79
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,460
Leyao.

80
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,530
Here.

81
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,100
Search Nanny Qi's room.

82
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,500
Yes.

83
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,780
Very well, I'll wait right here today.

84
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,340
Let's see who holds the golden hairpin.

85
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,340
Rong'er.

86
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,300
Nanny.

87
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,500
Madam Rong'er, the proof is clear.

88
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,020
Do you have anything left to say?

89
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,920
Jiang Leyao, did you steal it?

90
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,390
Madam Rong'er.

91
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,350
Was it the maid who took it,

92
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,940
or did you take it yourself?

93
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,940
(Chang Rong'er,
you never change your ways,)

94
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,060
(accusing me again.)

95
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,820
(Then I have no choice, but to play along)

96
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,220
(with the self-injury ruse.)

97
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,340
I did not, My Lady.

98
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,540
We'll know after questioning.

99
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,250
Guards, bring out the family discipline.

100
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:25,930
It hurts.

101
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,700
(Xiao Jingchu, are you not coming?)

102
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,100
My Lord, the Hai hour has come.

103
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,540
You have a date. Will you not go?

104
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,420
I won't go.

105
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,060
My Lord, the gambler we've watched

106
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,140
just entered Ning Manor.

107
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,660
Let's go. Follow me to catch him.

108
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,180
My Lord, that's the Ning Manor.

109
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,140
Is it wise to barge in like this?

110
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,220
Xuanyin Division arrests as needed.

111
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,180
Even the palace would not stop us.

112
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,260
Yes, My Lord.

113
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,180
Dear Leyao,

114
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,500
if you wish to avoid more pain,

115
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,660
then confess quickly.

116
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,540
I will plead for you.

117
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,500
You never would.

118
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,460
Bring forth the aphrodisiac.

119
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,020
Put her in a sack, strip her down,

120
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,860
and release the mice and cats inside.

121
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,020
Even a strong man can't take it.

122
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,740
Leyao, your fate is uncertain now.

123
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,460
Clear out,
Xuanyin Division is on the case.

124
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,780
(I won the bet.)

125
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,340
Lord Xiao,
my master is away honoring ancestors.

126
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,340
You've broken into Ning Manor twice.

127
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,540
Aren't you afraid he will be angry?

128
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,540
If a suspect is found in Ning Manor,

129
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,260
Duke Ning should be the one

130
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,780
to worry.

131
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,620
Search the place.

132
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,460
Xiao Jingchu.

133
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,140
Help me.

134
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,500
Please, help me.

135
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,960
Please.

136
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,380
Help me, please.

137
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:43,570
Lord Xiao.

138
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,910
Lord Xiao!

139
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,630
Let go of me.

140
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,500
No, don't.

141
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,180
Hurry, put her in the sack.

142
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,080
No, please.

143
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,020
Don't!

144
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,050
Stop, please.

145
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,780
Let me go.
