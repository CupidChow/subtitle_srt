11

Bingqing,

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,400
why must we watch this so late at night?

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,720
Haven't you heard that saying?

14
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,720
"Night parade of a hundred ghosts."

15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,200
"Spirits at play among mortals."

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,240
(At last, I'll find out)

17
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,200
(what you evil spirits truly are.)

18
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,120
Let's go.

19
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,220
=Episode 14=
=Begonia Snow=

20
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,280
Do you see who's lying on the stage?

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,960
Why does she look so lifeless?

22
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,320
Like someone waiting to be ordered around.

23
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,880
Anyone who takes Furong Elixir

24
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,080
ends up just like that.

25
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,600
The real show is about to start. Enjoy.

26
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,280
Bingqing, we're both women,

27
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,440
yet you can still smile at this?

28
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,080
This world spares no one, man or woman.

29
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,800
Where are you going?

30
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,240
I'm not feeling well. I'll head back.

31
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,800
If you can't stand it, just leave.

32
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,720
Something's wrong! There's a fire!

33
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,170
Go, go, go!

34
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,670
There's a fire.

35
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,040
- Hurry!
- Move!

36
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,640
Quickly!

37
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,080
It's really you.

38
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,520
Go! Hurry, get out!

39
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,680
Hurry up!

40
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,520
The show's only halfway through.

41
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,920
I've got nowhere to vent my anger.

42
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,320
What's happening inside?

43
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,560
There...

44
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,160
There's a fire.

45
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,680
Little lady, here I come.

46
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,720
Let me go, please?

47
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,120
Back then when I begged you

48
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,280
to let me go,

49
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,000
do you remember what you told me?

50
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,840
Just endure it, it'll pass.

51
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,960
Now, I'm giving back

52
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,720
those same words to you.

53
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,560
Jiang Leyao.

54
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,640
Xiao Jingchu,
aren't you with Xuanyin Division?

55
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,440
What are you waiting for? Seize her!

56
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,640
Hand him over to me.

57
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,120
I'll see justice is done for you.

58
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,640
My Lord.

59
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,640
You may leave now.

60
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,160
Do you want it or not?

61
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,080
Get some more rest now.

62
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,480
You're truly not arresting me?

63
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,720
I'm not.

64
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,680
You don't ask me why?

65
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,640
I won't ask.

66
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,000
But I want to tell you.

67
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,840
After Begonia Snow,

68
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,960
I was given a second chance.

69
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,280
Yet the pain from that night

70
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,440
still haunts me to this day.

71
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,760
Though my body was unharmed,

72
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,520
the ache inside never left.

73
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,600
Only by scratching myself,

74
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,120
could I feel any relief.

75
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,880
From now on, I'll help you.

76
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,320
I'll seek the justice myself.

77
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,360
Besides,

78
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,320
My Lord, what I truly want

79
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,160
has never been just someone's pity.

80
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,920
What I want

81
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,840
is something you can't offer.

82
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,000
Jiang Leyao,

83
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,560
from now on, I'll be your armor.

84
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,400
Just be yourself, that's enough.
