11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,190
Inform the Beasts Garden,

12
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,510
a newcomer is arriving.

13
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,220
Must we really act this way?

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,270
He'll strike again very soon.

15
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,400
I have to

16
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,670
seize this chance.

17
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,640
Trust me.

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,790
Risking yourself isn't wise.

19
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,230
But I know one thing.

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,150
You'll always keep me safe.

21
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,500
=Episode 26=
=King of Beasts=

22
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,550
So you followed Duke Ning

23
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,830
just to get close to me.

24
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,900
What else could it be?

25
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,470
Did you think I liked you?

26
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,390
Xiao Jingyou,

27
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,510
you've slaughtered the innocent.

28
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,790
You show no regard for lives.

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,800
It's unforgivable.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,840
Now,

31
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,710
come back to the palace with me

32
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,190
and report this to Father.

33
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,190
They're just commoners.

34
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,430
Who would ever care?

35
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,150
If they're not rich by words,

36
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,110
nor warriors in battle,

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,390
what use are their lives?

38
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,630
I burned them all

39
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,430
to reduce the court's cost.

40
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,910
I'm only trying to
ease Father's worries.

41
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,070
A nation stands on its people,

42
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,990
no matter rich or poor,

43
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,910
yet you see them as nothing.

44
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,110
You're unworthy to be Crown Prince!

45
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,350
That's not for you to decide.

46
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,070
You two

47
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,510
are indeed clever,

48
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,110
but far too naïve.

49
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,670
Do you really think

50
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,750
I'd let both of you walk out alive?

51
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,470
I think

52
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,680
you would.

53
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,320
Wang Yan,

54
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,990
are you not coming out?

55
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,310
Your Highness,

56
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,670
please allow us

57
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,230
to escort you back to the palace.

58
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,710
Jingyou, do you admit your fault?

59
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,310
Father,

60
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,680
I...

61
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,750
I was just being careless.

62
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,110
Please forgive me.

63
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,990
You are not a child anymore.

64
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,250
You should know better.

65
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,360
Well,

66
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,470
you're grounded for three months.

67
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,800
Reflect on it.

68
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,230
Thank you, Father.

69
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,350
I will reflect as you command.

70
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,600
Father,

71
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,040
this concerns

72
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,750
the lives of 2,731 people.

73
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,550
I am well aware of that.

74
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,030
But he is the Crown Prince,

75
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,870
my legitimate heir,

76
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,210
the foundation of the realm.

77
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,790
Even if he sometimes

78
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,430
strays from the right path,

79
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,310
I will guide him myself.

80
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,150
You have no right to judge him.

81
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,590
Your Majesty, everyone is equal

82
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,910
before the law.

83
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,550
If he gets away with it,
the people won't be appeased.

84
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,270
Esteemed Ministers,

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,110
what are your thoughts?

86
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,870
Your Majesty, he is young and has erred,

87
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,230
but he now shows true remorse.

88
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,750
As the Crown Prince of our nation,

89
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,390
his confinement

90
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,910
will allow him
to study the principles of governance,

91
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,430
and someday rule the nation.

92
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,070
We agree.

93
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,620
Very well.

94
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,270
You both witnessed it.

95
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,870
He is the Crown Prince,

96
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,750
and in the future,

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,910
he will be the sovereign
you must protect.

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,470
It's sheer folly

99
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,750
to oppose him.

100
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,510
Your Majesty,
it's a life-and-death matter.

101
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,990
You speak of this so lightly.

102
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,110
Aren't you afraid
you'll lose their hearts?

103
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,960
Silence.

104
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,910
Matters of the imperial court

105
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,990
are not for a woman to discuss,

106
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,630
let alone meddle here as you please.

107
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,310
If you two cause more trouble,

108
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,590
I will not show mercy.

109
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,480
Dismissed.

110
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,830
Don't you see by now?

111
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,990
You're not fighting me,

112
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,070
but fate itself.

113
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,190
So you see,

114
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,390
defeat is certain.

115
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,390
Father, Father.

116
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,310
I beg you, Father.

117
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,550
Please save my mother.

118
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,950
- Enough.
- Father.

119
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,170
She is but an imperial consort.

120
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,590
Her death means nothing.

121
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,350
Is it because it concerns me

122
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,950
that he shows no care at all?

123
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,390
His Majesty cares only for himself,

124
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,970
not a single person else,

125
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,870
only for his own power.

126
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,950
He is unjust.

127
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,270
He sees lives as nothing.

128
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,150
All the imperial court shields itself.

129
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,790
Loyalty and deceit are now blurred.

130
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,070
Is there truly no justice left,

131
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,500
no truth in this world anymore?

132
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,520
Jingchu,

133
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,350
the Crown Prince will never let you go.

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,230
If you face him head-on,

135
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,350
there's no chance you'll win.

136
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,870
Let me issue an order instead,

137
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,550
sending you to the Northwest for now.

138
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,790
The Northwest?

139
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,950
Am I to hide there my whole life?

140
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,910
The Emperor favors the Crown Prince.

141
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,070
No matter what happened,

142
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,790
the Emperor never blamed him.

143
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,910
Is that true affection,

144
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,270
or is it praise to harm?

145
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,470
All of you useless, get out!

146
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,390
That's the third round tonight.

147
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,030
Whoever comes won't help.

148
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,080
Don't you know?

149
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,910
Everyone says it's the Crown Prince...

150
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,080
Guards!

151
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,030
Cut out those two's wicked tongues,

152
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,350
right now!

153
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,880
Yes.

154
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,870
I feel unwell.

155
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,150
Summon the physician.

156
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,050
Call for the Imperial Physician.

157
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,980
Call for the Imperial Physician.

158
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,440
Your Highness.

159
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,750
Where is your master?

160
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,880
Why?

161
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,350
Have I lost all sway with him now?

162
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,550
Please calm yourself.

163
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,190
The seventh prince's caught a chill.

164
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,510
My master's ordered to look after him.

165
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,190
Father treats him

166
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,670
with such care.

167
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,950
Your pulse is steady.

168
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,830
My master said,

169
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,110
consistent medication
will lead to results.

170
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,440
Come here.

171
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,240
Closer.

172
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,710
It's been ten years.

173
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,030
It has never had any effect.

174
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,030
Today, you shall try it for me.

175
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,790
See if this medicine is true or not.

176
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,030
Why did you spit it out?

177
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,760
Please spare me.

178
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,640
This medicine

179
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,630
only makes people weaker and weaker.

180
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,110
How dare you plot against me!

181
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,150
(No. You wouldn't dare.)

182
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,910
Come here, son.

183
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,230
Good child.

184
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,350
If you listen and take your medicine,

185
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,310
everything in Father's room

186
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,590
will one day be yours.

187
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,630
Even the Imperial Seal?

188
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,480
Look at you.

189
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,470
Always so impatient.

190
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,880
Don't worry,

191
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,670
