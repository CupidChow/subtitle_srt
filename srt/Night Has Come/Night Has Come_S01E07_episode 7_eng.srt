1
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:15,040


2
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,600
   

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,780
   

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,930
   

5
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,950
   

6
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:39,410
   

7
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,840
   

8
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,310
   

9
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,620
   

10
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,190
Where are you going?

11
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,650
To the restroom.

12
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,770
So someone will come in the morning, right?

13
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,720
Let's just leave if no one does.

14
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,610
   

15
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,140
   

16
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,100
   

17
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,150
What are we going to do?

18
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,180
It's almost 6 a.m.

19
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,090
Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing?

20
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,980
Hey.

21
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,630
Choi Ju Won! What are you doing?

22
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,630
Ju Won! Choi Ju Won!

23
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,410
I guess we really do die if we don't kill.

24
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,290
What are we going to do?

25
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,690
Hey!

26
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,960
Hold on. Hold on.

27
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,040
Hold on a second!

28
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,500
Let go of me!

29
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,440
Please… No! No…

30
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,990
It's because of you.

31
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,360
It's all because of you.

32
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,840
 Follow the mafia's rule. 

33
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:27,610
 You must have a Mafia meeting and unanimously choose a person to execute. 

34
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,710
   

35
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,020
 You must have a Mafia meeting and unanimously choose a person to execute. 

36
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:49,380
   

37
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,280
I should have told you...

38
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,470
that I liked you.

39
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,700
That I really liked you.

40
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:32,400
 Before the previous voting ended, 

41
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,590
 the Doctor decided to use their healing ability on Kim Jun Hui. 

42
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:42,770
 Kim Jun Hui was revived by the Doctor's healing ability. 

43
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,400
Jun Hui…

44
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,690
What a relief.

45
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,990
It's such a relief.

46
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:35,210
I was so scared.

47
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,710
I'm glad.

48
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,140
I'm so glad.

49
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,370
Does any of this make sense? The Class President is alive?

50
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,230
Wow, even if you are the doctor…

51
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,220
Kim Jin Ha?

52
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:10,130
 Last night, Shin Seung Bin was executed by the mafia. 

53
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,460
- What? 
 - Hey, hey, Kim Jin Ha.

54
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,810
 Shin Seung Bin was a civilian. 

55
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,370
 Morning has come. 

56
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,500
- Geez, you scared me. 
 - What's this?

57
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,470
- Why aren't you wearing your shirt? 
  - Please find the mafia and start voting. 

58
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,380
What's that blood?

59
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,590
Whose blood is it?

60
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,720
It's nothing.

61
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,890
Hey.

62
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,310
What's wrong with him? Wasn't that blood?

63
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,340
It's 100%. It is 100% blood.

64
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,860
- What? 
 - Let's have a look.

65
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,010
Jun Hui!

66
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,370
I thought you were dead. I was so scared!

67
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,650
Are you okay? Are you injured at all?

68
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,200
I'm okay.

69
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,100
- Let's go. 
 - Hold on.

70
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,990
Have you seen that photo from yesterday?

71
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,230
The one Yun Seo had.

72
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,200
What?

73
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,290
You threw it away here yesterday, didn't you?

74
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,100
You must be kidding.

75
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,160
Do you still believe what she said?

76
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,160
You died because of her. Pull yourself together!

77
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,050
- Kim So Mi. 
 - It's true.

78
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,050
Am I mistaken?

79
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,730
Shit!

80
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,250
What?

81
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,550
Hey!

82
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,410
Did you kill him?

83
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,990
It wasn't me. I didn't kill him.

84
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,870
I found him like that in the morning.

85
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,990
It wasn't me.

86
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,520
Guys, it really wasn't me.

87
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,170
Hey, Lee Yun Seo.

88
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,550
The three were always together.

89
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,810
What disloyal bastards.

90
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,450
Let's go. The smell of blood makes me want to throw up.

91
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,390
Seung Bin…

92
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,480
has been stabbed countless times.

93
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,260
Why did they have to go so far?

94
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,110
Let's not talk about it. I don't want to know.

95
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,020
It gives me the shivers.

96
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:25,040
I think they kept stabbing him even after he died.

97
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,090
The others weren't as badly injured

98
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,170
but this time,

99
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,680
I feel like they killed him with intention.

100
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:49,750
Shin Seung Bin was dead, covered in blood, and I had all that blood on me.

101
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,340
I was so freaking shocked.

102
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,670
It really, wasn't you?

103
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,940
It wasn't.

104
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,170
Shit...

105
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:10,280
Everyone seems suspicious of me, right?

106
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,700
- Yes. 
 - Shit.

107
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:17,210
Why did that bastard Shin Seung Bin have to die while he was with me?

108
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:27,450
Gyeong Jun, please tell everyone that I'm not the mafia.

109
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,500
They all listen to you.

110
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,250
You said we should help each other.

111
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,710
Okay.

112
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:44,060
Thank you, Gyeong Jun. I'll be really nice to you.

113
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,130
   

114
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,860
Hey, did you write this?

115
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,700
I didn't do it.

116
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,170
What's going on?

117
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,660
Was this actually written by the police officer?

118
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,570
It wasn't here yesterday, was it?

119
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:08,370
No. I don't think I've seen it.

120
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,590
   

121
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,940
- It wasn't me. 
 - Then who wrote it?

122
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,490
Really, who is the police officer?

123
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,540
- Was it you? 
 - How could it be me?

124
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:29,070
Yesterday, I had no choice but to lie.

125
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,620
I am really a civilian. I don't know who the doctor is,

126
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,050
but thank you.

127
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:39,700
Hey, your revival is a separate issue.

128
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,810
We don't know if you're a civilian or not.

129
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,570
It's true.

130
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,560
Why didn't they mention Jun Hui's occupation?

131
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,900
They usually tell you when they die.

132
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,450
They probably didn't tell us because he didn't actually die.

133
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:59,690
You really didn't write that message on the wall?

134
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,870
I didn't.

135
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,240
I didn't have the time either.

136
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,020
You must have written it at dawn.

137
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:10,540
Hey, why would he lie about being a mafia? Unless he's crazy.

138
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,550
Let's just vote for him.

139
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,300
Hey, Jun Hui is a civilian.

140
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,640
What if it was actually written by the police officer?

141
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,280
Exactly. The doctor could have used his ability. He knows he's a civilian.

142
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:29,450
Shouldn't we look for Seung Bin's killer first?

143
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,310
I said it wasn't me.

144
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:41,090
I said I found him dead in the morning.

145
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,970
You said you were alone with him, didn't you?

146
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,870
Did you notice anything strange?

147
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,330
I don't know.

148
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:52,890
The mafia put blood on me while I slept.

149
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,450
Isn't that right, Gyeong Jun?

150
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,760
You do know that I am a civilian, right?

151
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,400
How would I know that?

152
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,430
What?

153
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:11,110
You showed up covered in blood. That's evidence.

154
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:16,060
You killed him because he always made fun of you. Didn't you?

155
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,640
Hey, you're all suspicious of Kim Jin Ha, too.

156
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,480
Let's just vote for him.

157
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,120
What kind of friend are you? You son of a bitch!

158
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,890
Mafia bastard. Do you want to die? Son of a bitch.

159
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,010
Son of a bitch.

160
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,500
Son of a bitch. You...

161
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,930
- Hey. 
 - Geez. Vote for him right now!

162
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,710
Hey. You don't even know for sure.

163
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,490
Shut up and just vote already!

164
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,940
Give that to me.

165
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,860
Will you continue doing whatever you want?

166
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,440
Motherfucker, just give it back.

167
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:03,220
If you keep behaving like this, you might get all the votes.

168
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,580
Let's regroup at 11 p.m.

169
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,780
We'll delay voting until then.

170
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,320
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

171
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,730
Hey, Kim So Mi.

172
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,160
Let's talk for a second.

173
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,500
Hey!

174
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,730
It really wasn't me.

175
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,620
Don't vote for me.

176
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,740
I'll find the bastard who killed Shin Seung Bin.

177
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,510
All of you, just wait and see.

178
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,360
Do you think that Jin Ha really did kill him?

179
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,980
He must have known we would suspect him because of the blood.

180
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,080
He has no reason to behave like this.

181
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,530
I know.

182
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:36,220
He should've just told us. Why did he run away?

183
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,700
It made him look suspicious.

184
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,060
By the way, Go Gyeong Jun is also quite good.

185
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,500
He dumped Kim Jin Ha on the spot.

186
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,790
Wow, what a bunch of disloyal bastards.

187
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,660
From the way he acts, Go Gyeong Jun, that idiot, is definitely Mafia.

188
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,350
   

189
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,900
Guys.

190
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:00,190
If the police officer really wrote this,

191
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,950
why did he only mention Jun Hui?

192
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:07,170
The police officer must know someone else's occupation since the ability was used twice.

193
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,950
Maybe there's something written somewhere else.

194
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,190
Why not write who the mafia is instead?

195
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,890
Don't accuse Yun Seo or others of being a mafia to me.

196
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,280
Jun Hui, I was trying to save you…

197
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,350
I was trying to help you.

198
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,550
I never asked for help.

199
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,420
Don't use me as an excuse.

200
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,610
You did all that for yourself.

201
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,240
Hey, Kim Jun Hui!

202
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,160
Do you know what I've done for you all this time?

203
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:49,550
Who stood by your side when everyone suspected you? It was me!

204
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:53,190
Hey, come to your senses.

205
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:58,460
Then it won't matter if I think of you as the mafia from now on, will it?

206
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,730
Think whatever you want.

207
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,780
Yu Jun.

208
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,070
Eat even if you don't want to.

209
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,110
You've been starving all this time.

210
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:38,430
My laptop. It's down in the basement.

211
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:41,110
Oh, right.

212
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,770
Let's go together.

213
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:14,200
Look. Their position hasn't changed.

214
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,880
Isn't it strange?

215
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,450
Look.

216
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,160
What's this?

217
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,280
How's that possible?

218
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,960
Exactly…

219
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,690
Let me see.

220
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,570
Hold on.

221
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,040
Yun Seo.

222
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,920
Which bastard was it?

223
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,700
I didn't notice anything weird.

224
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,170
 Yesterday when we ran away… 

225
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,760
 Hey! What about us? 

226
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,670
 It's more dangerous when we're together. 

227
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:26,740
 Where are we supposed to go? 

228
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,000
 Go to the arcade or wherever. 

229
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,990
Only Go Gyeong Jun…

230
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,750
knew we were hiding in here.

231
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,130
For once, you didn't follow Kim Jun Hui.

232
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,740
Don't mention him in front of me anymore.

233
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,250
Na Hui, you're done eating, right?

234
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,740
Let's go.

235
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,700
She's so freaking sensitive. What's going on?

236
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,170
She had a fight with Kim Jun Hui earlier. Don't they get along?

237
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,680
Leave when you're done stuffing yourself.

238
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,690
We haven't eaten yet.

239
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,330
Don't you know what it means to have a break?

240
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,220
We're closed.

241
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,210
Let me rest, too.

242
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:39,600
What's the matter with him now?

243
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,450
Hey, shut the door behind you.

244
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,000
   

245
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:38,740
   

246
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:48,040
The host?

247
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,780
Yun Seo.

248
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,180
What are you doing?

249
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,130
This is doing the same thing.

250
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,980
What is that?

251
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,010
Well…

252
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:29,380
It was fine when we filmed it,

253
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,360
but now our faces look weird.

254
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:35,530
It looks just like the group photo, does it not?

255
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,230
Why is it like this?

256
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,630
I saw that ghost earlier,

257
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,310
and I found this, too.

258
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,940
What is it for?

259
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,360
I'm not sure, but

260
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,630
we even got a message, so it must be important.

261
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,910
What message?

262
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,920
The message that tells us to find the host.

263
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,950
Didn't you get it?

264
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:11,160
   

265
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,460
No, I didn't.

266
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,330
How about you guys?

267
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,700
I didn't get it.

268
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,970
Me, neither.

269
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,730
What?

270
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,920
Am I the only one?

271
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,630
What is it? Let me see.

272
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:35,030
It's gone now.

273
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,000
Anyway, there must be a reason they want us to find the host.

274
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,730
Let's tell everyone and look together.

275
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:43,480
Do we need to tell them now?

276
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:49,890
Honestly, I'm not sure what you're talking about.

277
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,480
Yesterday we went to the pool, but there was nothing there, either.

278
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,100
You don't want them to think again that you're mafia by telling them about this.

279
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,410
This has nothing to do with the mafia.

280
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:06,530
- I said, I also got a message. 
 - You said it disappeared.

281
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:09,430
There's nothing we can do if they don't believe you.

282
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,500
You don't believe me, either, do you?

283
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,790
Well, it's not that.

284
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,710
The situation is a bit…

285
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:30,230
Yes. I'm only saying that until we find clear evidence,

286
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:34,420
we should be careful or we might arouse suspicion.

287
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,640
Yun Seo, I believe you,

288
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,600
but Jeong Won is right, too.

289
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,390
Let's not worry others and keep it to ourselves for the time being.

290
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,890
Okay.

291
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:51,530
I just have to find the photo album and show it, right?

292
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:44,310
 The game must be played within the designated area. 

293
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,210
   

294
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,860
Fuck. Go Gyeong Jun!

295
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:51,090
I was wondering who was following me. You were the rat.

296
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,650
You bastard.

297
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,060
You were hiding an ax.

298
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,460
What's this now?

299
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,260
What the fuck is this?

300
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,260
You tried to burn it and remove the evidence, right?

301
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,630
It really was you, wasn't it?

302
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,350
You're the one who killed Shin Seung Bin!

303
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,230
Fuck! I was a victim, too!

304
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,780
Victim, my foot.

305
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:25,080
You tried to frame me for it. You crazy Mafia bastard.

306
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,380
Can you still call yourself a human?

307
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,300
Fuck!

308
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,200
Hey! Damn!

309
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,250
Give it to me!

310
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,590
Give it to me! Shit!

311
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,510
That fucker!

312
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,600
Come here, you son of a bitch! Fuck!

313
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,770
Let go, you fuckers.

314
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,560
Let go!

315
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,500
Let go, you Mafia bastards!

316
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:07,130
You killed Shin Seung Bin and Ji Su…

317
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:09,360
You killed Ji Su, too, didn't you? You sons of bitches!

318
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,090
I told you I didn't!

319
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,050
Guys! Go Gyeong Jun and Kim Jin Ha are—

320
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:15,070
Hey, shut up!

321
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,070
Shut his mouth!

322
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:30,020
   

323
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,330
Shit, why did you have to push him like that?

324
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:40,280
Then you should have held him tight.

325
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,440
Hey, hey, hey.

326
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,520
What are you doing?

327
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:10,920
We'll be fucked if he tells everyone.

328
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:14,700
Do you think they'll believe us?

329
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:53,620
What are you doing?

330
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:56,550
Kill him.

331
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,470
Shit.

332
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,730
   

333
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:29,150
   

334
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,700
   

335
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:40,000
