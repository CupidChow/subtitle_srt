1
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,570
   

2
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,730
   

3
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,010
   

4
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,260
   

5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,460
   

6
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,730
   

7
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,000
   

8
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:03,970


9
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,850
Yun Seo, are you okay?

10
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,920
 Before the last voting ended, the police officer used their power. 

11
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,120
 Park Ji Su was executed by the mafia overnight. 

12
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,960
 Park Ji Su was a civilian. 

13
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,450
 Participants, please find the mafia and start voting. 

14
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,270
Here we go again.

15
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,760
Will we be able to get out of here?

16
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,770
We must.

17
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:17,380
Let's find a way quickly and go home.

18
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,710
Okay.

19
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,320
Let's get out.

20
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,590
Ji Su...

21
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,820
Ji Su...

22
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,330
Ji Su...

23
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,110
Ji Su...

24
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,110
   

25
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,680
   

26
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,890
   

27
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,040
Why did you want to see us?

28
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,440
   

29
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,990
"Park Wu Ram was the mafia."

30
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,440
See?

31
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,050
What did I tell you?

32
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,070
Go Gyeong Jun, you have damn good instincts.

33
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,130
What's the police officer doing?

34
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,520
Watch and learn.

35
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,170
You saw, right? Do what I tell you to do if you want to catch the mafia quickly.

36
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,810
What do you want us to do?

37
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:15,820
Let's hear who you think the mafia is one by one, and then I'll pick.

38
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,310
Why would you decide that?

39
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,630
We should decide together.

40
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,780
Yes. Who do you think you are?

41
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,070
Didn't you see Park Wu Ram flipping out, trying to kill me last night?

42
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,900
Is there anyone else who is more clearly a civilian?

43
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,670
In my opinion,

44
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,530
the mafia is among the ones who voted for me yesterday.

45
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,170
No.

46
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,220
We really aren't the mafia.

47
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,220
You teamed up with Park Wu Ram and tried to kill me.

48
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,590
What's more clear evidence than that?

49
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,640
We really didn't know, either.

50
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,490
Don't just judge based on what happened yesterday.

51
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,640
Fuck, then how do you want me to judge?

52
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,660
You guys are the only ones who voted for me.

53
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,880
Is that all?

54
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,150
Your logic is freaking weak.

55
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,610
- Hey. 
 - What?

56
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,230
That's enough.

57
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,030
How about Ji Su then?

58
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,850
We were close to her. Why would we kill her?

59
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,080
There was no reason to kill her.

60
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,860
We're about to die. Why would you care if you're close?

61
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,770
Wasn't Ji Su the doctor?

62
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,520
Look carefully.

63
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,310
It says she was a civilian.

64
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,780
Yu Jun must be the doctor.

65
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,080
He pretended like he wasn't.

66
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:44,760
But, yesterday, why didn't the doctor use their power when the police officer did?

67
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,320
You're right.

68
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,240
Ji Su would've lived if they used their power.

69
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,740
Only Ji Su and Yu Jun were on the third floor, right?

70
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,510
Then why did only Ji Su die then?

71
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,490
Could Cha Yu Jun be the mafia?

72
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,000
Geez. Did he kill his girlfriend?

73
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,880
If that's true, that's freaking creepy.

74
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,880
Ji Su did nag on him often.

75
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,900
He always got yelled at by her.

76
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,740
Damn it. This is fucking frustrating.

77
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,410
I'll just pick someone for you.

78
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,660
Always does whatever he wants.

79
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,300
Kim Jun Hui, this bastard is the mafia.

80
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,400
Think about how he ran around with an ax because of Park Wu Ram.

81
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,570
He thought he was a civilian and tried to help him.

82
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,160
We just got betrayed by someone we trusted.

83
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,950
We were all played.

84
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,250
We're victims, too.

85
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,650
I agree.

86
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,960
I-I don't think we should vote for Jun Hui because of that.

87
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,430
Should I pick one of you then?

88
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,640
Go ahead and vote now.

89
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,150
Hey.

90
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,300
Haven't you heard of the presumption of innocence?

91
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,690
You don't even have solid evidence. Stop insisting.

92
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,810
What?

93
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,640
This isn't about picking someone you dislike.

94
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,550
How is this not a witch hunt?

95
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,110
My hunch is the evidence. You fucker.

96
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:37,510
Is there evidence this asshole isn't the mafia? No.

97
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,810
Evidence?

98
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,670
There is.

99
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,450
There's a place you can see the CCTV footage in the basement.

100
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,690
I'm sure everything was recorded there.

101
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,360
   

102
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,140
We'll catch all the mafia members at once.

103
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,320
This is insane.

104
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,430
Hey, Mensa. Hurry. You're so freaking slow.

105
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,850
It's Mensan, I said.

106
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,940
I just turned it on. Wait a bit.

107
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,370
What's this?

108
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,990
Hold on a second.

109
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,080
What?

110
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,550
There are no files. I think someone deleted them.

111
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,150
Maybe they were saved somewhere else. Look again.

112
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,990
It's not that. There really is nothing.

113
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:39,030
It's not like an automatic reset was set up.

114
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,750
Someone deleted them on purpose.

115
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,630
Hey, Lee Yun Seo. What is this?

116
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,150
You're so aggravating.

117
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,220
Wow. The mafia bastards. Their teamwork is impressive.

118
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,610
You deleted them, didn't you?

119
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,040
It's not like that.

120
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,710
Don't deny it.

121
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,860
You always defended Park Wu Ram with the Class President.

122
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,300
Obviously, you came late because you deleted the files.

123
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,690
You deleted them, and you're acting innocent.

124
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,510
- I said it's not like that! 
 - Lee Yun Seo.

125
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,240
How did you know you can watch CCTV footage here?

126
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,600
What?

127
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,110
You obviously know about this place because you tried to delete the footage.

128
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,430
Am I wrong?

129
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,440
Wait...

130
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,710
I found this place by chance, too.

131
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,660
Why would she have suggested coming here if she did?

132
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,180
That's right. And she doesn't know how to do this kind of stuff.

133
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,980
It's game over then.

134
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,810
- I voted. 
 - Hey, Go Gyeong Jun.

135
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:37,460
 - Go Gyeong Jun voted for Lee Yun Seo.  
 - Hold on.

136
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:43,680
 Kim Jin Ha and Shin Seung Bin voted for Lee Yun Seo. 

137
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,230
 Cha Yu Jun voted for Lee Yun Seo. 

138
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,740
Guys, hold on.

139
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,260
I'm really a civilian.

140
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,810
I'll prove that I am. Okay?

141
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,250
Just give me a chance until tonight. Please.

142
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,810
Yun Seo really isn't the mafia.

143
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:08,090
I'll restore the CCTV files. Give me some time.

144
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,400
You're right. We can vote at night.

145
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,260
Yes. We can find out who the mafia is once we restore the files.

146
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,230
Okay.

147
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,920
Let's go.

148
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,150
Yun Seo.

149
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,530
 I'll restore the CCTV files by 11. Let's vote then. 

150
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,960
So we're meeting back up at 11?

151
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,160
Yes. She'll restore the footage and show it to us.

152
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,200
Seriously. They're desperate to buy time.

153
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,950
But it'd be crazy if it really was recorded.

154
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,940
Yes. That'd be indisputable.

155
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,570
   

156
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,070
I should've voted for Lee Yun Seo immediately earlier.

157
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,790
Why?

158
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:32,320
Go Gyeong Jun keeps suspecting us because of Wu Ram.

159
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,990
That's why it's easy to just go with the majority.

160
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,930
Do you want to just vote now?

161
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,820
What if we vote for Yun Seo and she's a civilian?

162
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,310
What?

163
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,230
We'd be guilty of killing her.

164
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,710
What do we do then?

165
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,740
What do you mean?

166
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,360
There's nothing you can do about it.

167
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,080
So?

168
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,160
Will you keep following Go Gyeong Jun's orders?

169
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,450
What if he tells you to vote for me or Jun Hui? Will you do that, too?

170
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,820
Hey, don't be like that.

171
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:12,680
And to be honest, we don't know who's the mafia and who's civilian.

172
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,950
So Mi...

173
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,180
you just don't like Yun Seo, isn't that it?

174
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,540
Hey.

175
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,430
Could you be the mafia, by chance?

176
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,750
What?

177
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:40,450
You've been getting along with Lee Yun Seo and Oh Jeong Won lately.

178
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:45,720
I wonder if it's because you're the mafia together.

179
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,330
Hey, Kim So Mi.

180
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,710
H-Hey, that's enough.

181
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,330
So Mi, just relax.

182
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:58,110
She must be having a hard time since Hyeon Ho died.

183
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,270
Hey, Na Hui.

184
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,230
A-Are you angry?

185
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,510
Hey, Ahn Na Hui!

186
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,380
Jeong Won, will you be able to restore the files by 11?

187
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:29,400
No. Not all of them. I need to choose a few from yesterday.

188
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,370
Hey. I didn't say I couldn't.

189
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:39,030
I'll restore the one from the third-floor hallway no matter what.

190
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,690
Yes. Let's not worry too much.

191
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,320
Jeong Won is more than capable.

192
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,270
You have a laptop, right?

193
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,190
Why?

194
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,270
I'll use yours, too. Go get it right now.

195
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,780
All right.

196
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,610
Hey.

197
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,680
Let me go check something out.

198
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,220
Where are you going?

199
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,910
Keep at it.

200
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:31,410
The CCTV was definitely working yesterday.

201
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,300
I saw the guys in the rooms, too.

202
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,320
But there is no CCTV in the room...

203
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,940
This is too weird.

204
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,440
Same with this.

205
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,830
Jun Hui.

206
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,490
I'm really not lying,

207
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,470
and I wasn't mistaken, either.

208
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,020
Yun Seo.

209
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,250
I believe you.

210
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,340
Let's do everything we can.

211
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:15,810
I need to go back to see if it connects to another place.

212
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,040
- Yes, let's check it out. 
 - Wait.

213
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,690
I'll go on my own. It's too narrow to get through.

214
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,930
It's scary to go alone.

215
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,020
You need a witness, too.

216
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,010
I'll go first.

217
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,520
Be careful.

218
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,040
Jun Hui.

219
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,230
If I were...

220
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,600
the mafia, what would you do?

221
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,980
I don't care.

222
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,600
Why don't you care?

223
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,970
Because I won't vote for you, anyway.

224
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,360
We're at the end.

225
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,330
But it's blocked.

226
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:52,300
What? Look again carefully.

227
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,020
I fell through the floor.

228
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,290
The floor is blocked, too.

229
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,900
For some reason,

230
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,320
I've been having dreams about...

231
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,980
me dying since we got here.

232
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,210
They're just dreams...

233
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,980
but it was scary.

234
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,160
Since I've been sick often,

235
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,750
I did...

236
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,430
think that...

237
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,670
I could die, but...

238
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,770
I never thought about dying here...

239
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,140
like this. Not even once.

240
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,040
Jun Hui.

241
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,530
I don't want to die.

242
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,900
You won't die.

243
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,450
I won't ever let you die.

244
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,610
We have to go home.

245
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,280
Are you not going to go?

246
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,170
I want to.

247
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,150
I want to go home.

248
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,710
Okay.

249
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,580
And don't worry, even if we can't get the CCTV footage.

250
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,910
We can find other ways.

251
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,010
Yun Seo.

252
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,060
Could there be other evidence?

253
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,900
Other evidence?

254
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,300
What's that?

255
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,700
It's blood.

256
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,970
I've read this in a book.

257
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,650
You can see it if you use this light.

258
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,090
What?

259
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,070
They must've broken in with an ax since the door was locked.

260
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,280
This blood is probably Wu Ram's from the ax.

261
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,400
It might be on the person who touched the ax.

262
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,610
We can find the person if we check everyone, right?

263
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:53,840
But the blood splashed on me since I was next to Wu Ram yesterday.

264
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,110
That could've happened to the others, too.

265
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,320
So we don't know for certain.

266
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,250
And even if they had blood on them, we don't know if it's Wu Ram's.

267
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,220
Innocent people might get framed.

268
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:17,410
 I think I can restore the footage from the third floor. 

269
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,480
I got it!

270
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,910
What the...

271
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:44,690
I restored the one from yesterday, so we just need to see who entered Ji Su's room.

272
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,270
It's okay.

273
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,320
What...

274
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,350
What's going on?

275
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,120
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Move!

276
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,150
Shit!

277
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,230
The fire, the fire!

278
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,390
Did you try to fucking burn all of us to death?

279
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,820
I really didn't do it.

280
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,410
Hey.

281
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,300
What's that?

282
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:47,970
Shit.

283
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,350
What's that?

284
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,290
Is that for real?

285
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,320
T-There must be a ghost.

286
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,300
Look.

287
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,450
Look at this!

288
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,770
This is the ghost we're seeing there.

289
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,230
I really think...

290
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:19,930
there's someone here other than us.

291
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:24,680
I think that ghost has to do with the mafia game.

292
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,130
Don't bullshit us. You're trying to fool us right now.

293
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,780
You idiot. Look at the timecode.

294
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,090
It's being filmed right now.

295
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,280
So...

296
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,080
do you want to play the murdering game quietly as you're told to?

297
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,050
What if you win?

298
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,410
Do you really think we could leave this place alive?

299
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:59,760
Do you still think that after seeing everyone die?

300
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,980
Get it together.

301
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,010
We need to find out who's making us play the game.

302
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,500
If we find the connection between that ghost and the Mafia game,

303
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,240
we might actually be able to get out.

304
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,690
   

305
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,110
Hey, it's almost midnight. Aren't you going to vote?

306
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,670
What if we try to vote a little differently?

307
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,950
Jun Hui, there's no time right now.

308
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,030
How would you vote differently, exactly?

309
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,790
Everyone almost died because of you. What nonsense is this now?

310
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,390
Yes, you Class President bastard.

311
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,340
All of us almost died because of you.

312
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,080
We can listen to him and make a decision.

313
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:16,150
What is it? Let's hear it.

314
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,900
Yun Seo got four votes out of thirteen, right?

315
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,530
You die if you get the majority of the votes. And you live if you don't.

316
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,970
We just need to split the remaining votes so no one gets the majority.

317
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:35,890
You want to cast four votes for someone, so it's a tie, right?

318
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,210
Yes.

319
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,220
That still counts as voting,

320
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,290
since we're not refusing to.

321
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,000
Who will tie with her then?

322
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,400
Vote for me.

323
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,140
What?

324
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,830
   

325
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:17,030
 Jin Da Beom voted for Kim Jun Hui. 

326
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:20,640
 Kim Jun Hui voted for Oh Jeong Won. 

327
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,040
 Im Eun Chan voted for Nam Yeon Wu. 

328
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:28,010
 Nam Yeon Wu voted for Im Eun Chan. 

329
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:35,410
 Ahn Na Hui and Oh Jeong Won voted for Kim Jun Hui. 

330
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:41,100
 Lee Yun Seo voted for Kim Juin Hui. 

331
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,280
 The voting will end in one minute. 

332
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:52,390
 Choi Mi Na voted for Kim So Mi. 

333
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:57,990
 Kim So Mi voted for Choi Mi Na. 

334
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,390
 The voting has ended. 

335
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,480
   

336
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,460
It worked!

337
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,820
I-It worked!

338
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,000
It worked! It worked! It worked!

339
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,570
Did it really work?

340
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:15,550
Really?

341
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:18,350
It worked! I-It worked!

342
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,770
It worked.

343
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,050
Let's go. Damn.

344
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:35,180
 Since Lee Yun Seo and Kim Jun Hui received the same number of votes, 

345
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:39,520
 there will be a second voting between them for five minutes. 

346
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:45,870
 Only the ones who didn't vote for them will vote again. 

347
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:50,430
 If it's a tie again, everyone will be executed. 

348
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,790
We'll all die?

349
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,890
Fuck. I knew it. Let's just vote for him and be done with it.

350
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,320
Only five people need to vote, right?

351
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,300
Me, Yeon Wu, Mi Na, and So Mi. Who else?

352
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,900
I-It's the Class President. He voted for Oh Jeong Won earlier.

353
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,870
Shit. Lee Yun Seo will get one vote already.

354
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:13,650
It's already been a minute!

355
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,000
- Shit! 
 - What do we do? Who do we vote for?

356
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,100
   

357
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,730
 - Kim So Mi...  
 - Hey, Kim So Mi.

358
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:35,680
 voted for Lee Yun Seo. 

359
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:44,190
It was suspicious when she dragged us here talking about a ghost.

360
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:47,460
We were supposed to vote for Lee Yun Seo. Hurry and vote!

361
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:51,730
This isn't right!

362
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,760
Don't vote for her.

363
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,090
- Don't do it. 
 - Don't.

364
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:59,230
Fuck! Just vote for anyone!

365
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,740
 Hey... 

366
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,610
 Are you okay now? 

367
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:14,740
 You quit swimming because you couldn't go in the water. 

368
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,990
 I'm okay. I'm all better now. 

369
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,370
 Hey! 

370
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:38,000
 I said I'm a civilian. 

371
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:44,150
 It's all my fault. 

372
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,200
 I'll take responsibility for everything. 

373
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,280
It's me.

374
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,650
I'm the mafia.

375
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,270
So vote for me.

376
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,650
Hey.

377
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,900
- What are you doing? 
 - Are you crazy?

378
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:08,970
I suggested collecting the phones so no one could vote,

379
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,350
and I deleted the CCTV files, too.

380
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,150
No.

381
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,140
I'm sorry.

382
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,720
I did it because I wanted to live, but–

383
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,750
No.

384
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,840
I can no longer...

385
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,500
kill people.

386
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,500
I knew it when he was running around with an ax.

387
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,750
Just vote for him and be done with it!

388
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,050
Hold on!

389
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,740
Hey.

390
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,810
I know you're not.

391
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:43,210
What are you doing? It's not true.

392
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,390
   

393
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:50,100
Hey, you're not. What are you doing?

394
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,450
 Choi Mi Na voted for Kim Jun Hui... 

395
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:57,640
Hey, don't do it. It's not Jun Hui! Don't!

396
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,700
Hey, it's not true.

397
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,300
- You really aren't! 
   - Im Eun Chan... 

398
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,240
 voted for Kim Jun Hui. 

399
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,350
We need to go.

400
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,810
Jun Hui, I know you aren't. Please...

401
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,100
- Let's go. 
 - Hold on! No!

402
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,870
You're not.

403
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:19,590
Hold on. Hold on.

404
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:22,250
- Yun Seo. 
 - Jun Hui!

405
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:27,030
 Kim Jun Hui, the one with the most votes, will be executed. 

406
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,680
No! No!

407
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,820
Kim Jun Hui!

408
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,160
Let go of me!

409
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,380
No, no, no...

410
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,420
No, no!

411
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:25,050


412
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:56,550
   

413
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,970
   

414
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:05,410
