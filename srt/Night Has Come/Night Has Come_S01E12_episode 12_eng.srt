1
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:15,080


2
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,590
   

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,770
   

4
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,900
   

5
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,960
   

6
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,370
   

7
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,660
   

8
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,620
 A mafia can't kill another mafia. 

9
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,160
Fuck.

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,150
You know what happens if you break the rules, right?

11
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,590
If you kill me,

12
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,730
you'll die, too.

13
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,510
Fuck. Hey!

14
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,790
I'll kill you, you fuckking bitch.

15
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,760
Where are you? Where are you?

16
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,410
Hey! Open the door!

17
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,820
 Hey! 

18
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,490
Open the door, I said! Fuck!

19
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,870
 Just give up. 

20
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,460
Everything will be over in thirty minutes, anyway.

21
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,050
Fuck. What are you saying?

22
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,160
Where... Where did this go? Why?

23
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,490
We're a team. You can't do this to me.

24
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,150
It's almost over. Why are you doing this? Please...

25
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,240
 Get it together! 

26
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,580
 There's no point saving Lee Yun Seo and Kim Jun Hui. 

27
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,700
They're civilians, and you're a mafia. You can't live together!

28
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,670
Fuck. Oh Jeong Won.

29
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,340
 When people die... 

30
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,610
hearing is the last sense you lose. You know that, right?

31
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,670
Listen carefully.

32
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,440
Fuck. Lee Yun Seo. You die, too.

33
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,700
Fuck...

34
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,330
Ahn Na Hui?

35
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,610
 Check if she died after thirty minutes and message me. 

36
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,530
It's so cold.

37
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,340
The blanket. The blanket...

38
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,200
Shit.

39
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,560
Fuck.

40
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,590
Shit.

41
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,900
Shit.

42
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:41,140
What? What's going on?

43
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,440
Why did it turn off?

44
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,590
Why...

45
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,050
Who's this?

46
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,520
Who's there!

47
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,500
Shit...

48
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,870
What are you doing? Don't do it. Don't do it.

49
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,490
Shit.

50
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,430
Shit, who's this?

51
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,760
Why are you doing this to me?

52
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,400
Fuck!

53
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,170
Don't come. Don't come, you bastard!

54
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,860
Fuck. Why? Why...

55
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,920
Why are you doing this even in death!

56
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,310
You were going to kill me if I didn't kill you!

57
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,720
Hey! Get lost!

58
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,510
Fuck! Get lost!

59
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,100
   

60
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:25,470
 Im Eun Chan and Choi Mi Na were executed by the mafia overnight. 

61
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:31,490
 Im Eun Chan and Choi Mi Na were civilians. 

62
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:37,840
 All participants, please find the mafia and begin voting. 

63
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,500
You should've killed me, too, if you were going to do this.

64
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,960
Why did you let me live?

65
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,500
I need to die if you want this to end the way you guys want.

66
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,670
So why did you let me live?

67
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,560
Why did you let me live?

68
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,570
What are you thinking, exactly?

69
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,880
I can't talk for long right now.

70
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,440
Let me take care of Jin Da Beom first.

71
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,270
What...

72
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,310
are you talking about?

73
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,490
Did you kill them?

74
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,570
Answer me.

75
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,500
Hey.

76
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,550
Say something!

77
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,290
Hey. Please calm down.

78
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,940
Let's talk later.

79
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,970
Hey, Oh Jeong Won.

80
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,600
Hey!

81
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,360
Jun Hui.

82
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,880
How could she do this to us?

83
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,050
   

84
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,890
   

85
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,480
   

86
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,770
 Jin Da Beom will try to kill you guys if he runs into you. Be careful. 

87
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,540
Why do you think...

88
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,800
Jeong Won didn't kill us?

89
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,040
Whatever. Don't think about that anymore.

90
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,000
We can't trust either of them anymore, anyway.

91
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,440
Let's vote for Jin Da Beom for now and think about what to do.

92
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,010
What do you mean?

93
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:32,070
He won't just sit still if we vote for him, too.

94
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,170
He'll do whatever he can.

95
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,920
And even if he dies, there will be Oh Jeong Won.

96
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,420
We'll be in danger at night.

97
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,710
We need to take care of things before that.

98
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,330
What...

99
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,160
are you thinking of doing?

100
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,900
If necessary,

101
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,490
we will have to kill her to stop her.

102
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,880
I'll go to the storage in case something might happen.

103
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,470
I'll come with you.

104
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,920
No. Get some rest.

105
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,390
- Why? I'll go, too. 
 - Please listen to me.

106
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,840
You know they're on the second floor.

107
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,710
I'll be right back. Keep the door locked.

108
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,220
Okay.

109
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,730
   

110
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:46,960
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

111
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,470
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

112
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,650
 What's this? 

113
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,410
 It's a birthday present. 

114
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,510
 Put it on me. 

115
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,240
 - Thank you. 
 - Do you like it? 

116
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,140
 I like it a lot. 

117
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,510
Jeong Won isn't here.

118
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,970
   

119
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,270
   

120
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,880
 But why did you let me live? 

121
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,270
 Why did you let me live? 

122
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,740
 I can't talk for long right now. 

123
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,190
No way.

124
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,180
Jin Da Beom is missing.

125
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,200
I'll look for him. Stay with Yun Seo–

126
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,170
That's enough.

127
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,540
I won't be fooled by you guys anymore.

128
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,680
He's really planning to kill us all.

129
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,530
- He's dangerous. 
 - That's enough, I said!

130
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,450
Hey.

131
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,520
I heard you guys are the mafia.

132
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,200
You and Jin Da Beom are the same to me and Yun Seo.

133
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,830
 Come to the rooftop if you want to save Lee Yun Seo.
  

134
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,970
Shit...

135
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,210
Yun Seo!

136
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,400
What the hell? I thought I'd seen it all.

137
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,940
Don't come.

138
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,650
Don't do that, you crazy bastard.

139
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,470
That's enough. Let go of Yun Seo.

140
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,650
Did you kill Go Gyeong Jun and Shin Seung Bin, too?

141
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,810
Are you happy you ended up just like them?

142
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,160
Shut up, you fucking bitch.

143
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,760
You don't have to go this far.

144
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,030
How does it feel to see me again?

145
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,890
- Happy to see me, right? 
 - I'm the one you want to kill.

146
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,760
Let go of Yun Seo.

147
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,140
I wish I could.

148
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,730
But what can I do?

149
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,460
I can't fucking stab you, you know.

150
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,120
- So what do you want? 
 - What else?

151
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,380
I should finish what I couldn't do yesterday.

152
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,510
Go upstairs.

153
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,890
- Do you want me to jump? 
 - Yes.

154
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,840
You have to die if I can't kill you.

155
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,540
No. No–

156
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,810
Shut your mouth!

157
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:29,830
Fuck! That's enough. You son of a bitch.

158
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,290
Hey. Do that to me instead.

159
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,220
Fuck. You stay out of this.

160
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,030
Shut up and just watch!

161
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,810
By the way,

162
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,000
what will you do after I die?

163
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,940
- Will you let go of Yun Seo? 
 - No...

164
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,490
As for that...

165
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,550
it depends on how you behave.

166
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,640
You won't let her live even if I die.

167
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,590
You don't want to jump? Should I kill her right now?

168
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,400
It's not that!

169
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,850
I wish I could do it, too, but...

170
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:05,790
I can't do it because this is against the rule, too.

171
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,090
What are you saying?

172
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,680
A mafia can't commit suicide.

173
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,100
They can't kill themselves.

174
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,500
Why not? What about Choi Ju Won then?

175
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,900
He got executed because he broke the rules.

176
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,570
This is a different situation.

177
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,640
Don't fucking come, I said.

178
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,810
I'd be dying because you threatened me, so you'd be killing me.

179
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,990
Shut up and jump!

180
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,460
Don't you remember my warning at the freezer last night?

181
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,600
Do you want to die together?

182
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,900
Don't come, fuck! Just jump!

183
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,910
Son of a bitch!

184
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,610
Die, you son of a bitch!

185
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,610
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

186
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,500
Let go, you son of a bitch.

187
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,880
Fuck!

188
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,110
Let's...

189
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,470
just die together.

190
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,660
Yun Seo.

191
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,700
Yun Seo!

192
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,820
Hey, you crazy son of a bitch!

193
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,710
You son of a bitch!

194
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,530
Fuck.

195
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:14,300
 Jin Da Beom has died. 

196
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:19,010
 Jin Da Beom was a mafia. 

197
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,670
Hang in there.

198
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,610
You need to stay awake.

199
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,280
Did you get hurt at all?

200
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,280
I'm okay.

201
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,130
It hurts! It hurts!

202
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,450
Okay...

203
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,770
- Don't talk. 
 - Yes.

204
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:49,600
- I'm okay. I'm okay. 
 - Don't talk.

205
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,520
I was going to take care of it.

206
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,110
Why did you do that? Why?

207
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,450
I'm sorry.

208
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,340
I think I know who you are now.

209
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,610
I missed you...

210
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,170
Se Eun.

211
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,270
But...

212
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,510
please stop now.

213
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,350
I'm sorry.

214
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,510
I...

215
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,400
I had no choice, either.

216
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,360
I know.

217
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,410
It's okay.

218
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,360
So...

219
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,420
please stop now.

220
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,230
Yun Seo. Yun Seo!

221
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:01,450
Wake up! Wake up, Yun Seo!

222
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,120
Yun Seo!

223
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,950
Hang in there for a bit.

224
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,130
I'll let you get out of here.

225
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,080
No.

226
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,830
Jeong Won.

227
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,450
No...

228
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,470
Yun Seo.

229
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,220
Yun Seo!

230
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,960
Hey, Yun Seo! Yun Seo!

231
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,590
Hey! Yun Seo!

232
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,650
 Oh Jeong Won has died. 

233
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:59,580
 Oh Jeong Won was a mafia. 

234
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:06,010
 The mafia game has ended with the civilian team's victory. 

235
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:13,820
Jun Hui. Jun Hui.

236
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,900
Wake up.

237
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,270
Kim Jun Hui!

238
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,990
Just leave him!

239
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:34,500
He might end up in a coma if you interrupt him while connected to the server.

240
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,200
   

241
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,520
   

242
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,640
   

243
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,730
   

244
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,690
Do you...

245
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,380
remember us?

246
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:10,740
You're Se Eun's parents.

247
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,810
What...

248
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,070
What is all this?

249
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,210
How was the game?

250
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:36,010
Was the dying experience scary and painful enough?

251
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,820
What did you say?

252
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,120
What happened to everyone?

253
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,990
What did you do?

254
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,530
Don't worry.

255
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,690
They're only asleep.

256
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,680
They're unconscious,

257
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,110
but the pain is real.

258
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,500
Was all of this a game?

259
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,780
You came here only recently,

260
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:16,170
but you've played the game dozens of times already.

261
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:19,140
Time moves at a different pace in the game.

262
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:25,900
But Jeong Won is supposed to be the sole winner in all games.

263
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,610
You guys won for the first time.

264
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:33,640
What did you do to Jeong Won that she helped you?

265
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,310
Tell me.

266
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:40,390
We need to know so we can fix it.

267
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:43,370
I woke you up to ask you that.

268
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,060
Why...

269
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,160
Why are you doing this? Why?

270
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,600
In the world my daughter created,

271
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,030
you all need to pay for your sins.

272
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,070
What sins?

273
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:06,320
What sins?

274
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,630
Did you really ask "what sins" just now?

275
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,810
The sin of bullying Se Eun, who was innocent.

276
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:24,240
The sin of putting her in hell by believing in the baseless rumor!

277
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,130
Those are your sins.

278
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,560
 Hey, get out of here. 
   

279
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,180
 Wh-Wh-What? What is it? 

280
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,790
 - What are you doing? 
 - Do you still collect porn? 

281
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:57,480
 Give it back! Give it back to me. 

282
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,770
 - Give it back to me, I said. 
 - Hold on, hold on. 

283
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,990
 Look what he's into. 

284
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:06,600
 Give me my phone back! 

285
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,300
   
   

286
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,990
   

287
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,120
   

288
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,440
   

289
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,550
   

290
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,310
 Wow, it's sexy. So sexy. 

291
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,070
 She's like a celebrity. A celebrity. 

292
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,530
 Where are you going? 

293
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,340
 Se Eun. 

294
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,440
Park Se Eun!

295
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,260
Hey, did something happen to her?

296
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,760
I don't know.

297
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,230
   

298
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,010
 Thanks to our CM: damiechan 

299
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,020
 Your classmate died. 

300
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,730
 But why... 

301
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,710
did no one try to take responsibility?

302
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:24,150
Everyone's afraid they'd be in trouble.

303
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:28,500
You say it was a joke, a misunderstanding, that you didn't know. They're all excuses.

304
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,780
No one owned up to their fault.

305
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,570
No one did.

306
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,680
That's why we created this game.

307
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:43,640
I wanted you to feel the pain

308
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,630
just like how our Se Eun felt.

309
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:56,730
To teach you what you've done.

310
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,700
   

311
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,210
   

312
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,370
Yes.

313
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:27,020
I know you were a special friend to Se Eun.

314
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,250
You should've saved her, then!

315
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:33,500
Why did you leave her to die?

316
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,090
You're just like the rest of them.

317
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:41,750
The memories get erased every time.

318
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:45,860
So you'll never get used to the pain.

319
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,580
It'll feel new every time.

320
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:59,470
Live in this game forever.

321
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,780
Wait...

322
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,900
I also...

323
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,500
miss...

324
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,770
Se Eun a lot.

325
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,530
I want to tell her...

326
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:49,200
she suffered so much alone.

327
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,910
I want to apologize for not knowing.

328
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,310
If someone has to be responsible,

329
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,430
I will.

330
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:09,620
So please let the rest of them go home. Please?

331
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,760
You're not entirely back to normal now.

332
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,590
It might hurt if you strain yourself.

333
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,250
I...

334
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,770
don't care about being in pain at all.

335
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:33,780
So just choose me.

336
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:39,800
Please let everyone go...

337
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,430
Everyone...

338
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:45,150
Let everyone go. Please...

339
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:49,170
Please...

340
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,880
   

341
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:12,070
She got her memories back because Jeong Won helped her.

342
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:16,060
She changed the setting as a birthday present, so she could get her memories back.

343
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:24,140
What are you trying to say?

344
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,850
Committing suicide wasn't one of the options.

345
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,480
Jeong Won took action, believing she was Se Eun.

346
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,720
She chose to save them.

347
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,810
Get it together!

348
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:40,850
That's not our daughter!

349
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:44,210
It's just an error caused by the setting.

350
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:50,360
- Let go. 
 - That wasn't a simple error! It was Jeong Won's will!

351
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:55,650
What if Se Eun doesn't want to play this game like Jeong Won?

352
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:00,470
What if we're taking revenge just for ourselves?

353
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,480
No.

354
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,630
We aren't even close.

355
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,580
We aren't even close yet.

356
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,810
She bet her life to save her friend.

357
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:16,730
Not everyone did, but some of them felt guilty toward Se Eun.

358
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:20,770
We could give them another chance at this point.

359
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:26,580
Let's have all of them go and keep an eye on them.

360
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,200
No, I can't do that.

361
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,110
Move.

362
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:38,470
Move, I said!

363
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:45,560
Our Se Eun...

364
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:49,960
is dead and gone now.

365
00:38:54,010 --> 00:39:00,950


366
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:31,950

 Thank you for watching! 

372
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:44,010
Shit! I lost again!

373
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:46,050
You scared me.

374
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,810
What's this?

375
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:51,370
Yes, Ms. Kim.

376
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:52,950
Where?

377
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,340
The bus stopped?

378
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,090
H-Hello? Hello?

379
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,390
No.

380
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:24,480
   

381
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:31,100
   

382
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,540
   

383
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,980
