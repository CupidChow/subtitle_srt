[Episode 3]

6
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,390
Kim Dong Hyeon was a civilian.

7
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,600
They're here.

8
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,110
What happened to Dong Hyeon?

9
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,250
H-Hey, say something.

10
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,670
Where's Dong Hyeon? What on earth happened?

11
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,500
He thought...

12
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,760
the white line disappeared...

13
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,220
and went to check on it.

14
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,200
But he slipped...

15
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,390
What about the village?

16
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,430
How far did you go?

17
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,460
You said you'd find people and ask for help! Did you?

18
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,140
We can't go.

19
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,420
It's all blocked by the lines.

20
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,810
We're completely trapped.

21
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,470
Then...

22
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,570
we're...

23
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,840
really trapped here until we finish the game?

24
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,950
Yeah.

25
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,760
Are you crying?

26
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,760
If I hadn't...

27
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,200
suggested going...

28
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,520
to the mountains,

29
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,600
they wouldn't have died.

30
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,600
If I had just stayed quiet...

31
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,100
Dong Hyeon died because of me.

32
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,550
It's not like you forced anyone.

33
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,400
They volunteered.

34
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,900
No one knew there was no path.

35
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,450
No one knew. What could we have done?

36
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,440
So...

37
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,340
what will you do now?

38
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,600
We can't leave here until the game is over.

39
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,650
Are you going to stay like this?

40
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,970
No.

41
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,090
I'm going to find another way.

42
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,590
Hello? Hello?

43
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,420
Hello? Hey. Hey!

44
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,510
Where are you going?

45
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,090
Gyeong Joon and the others called me.

46
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,750
Don't go if you don't want to.

47
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,950
I should still go.

48
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,870
Shit!

49
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,210
Damn it!

50
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,790
Hey, Kim Joon Hee!

51
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,850
What are you doing?

52
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,790
Isn't that a phone call?

53
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,830
What's wrong?

54
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,540
Hello?

55
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,940
Just leave it.

56
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,770
What's wrong?

57
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,280
It's all fake.

58
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,610
What?

59
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,560
The wire wasn't even connected.

60
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,770
What the heck?

61
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,300
Look at this.

62
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,310
It's empty.

63
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,490
You love sesame.

64
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,740
Yeah, thanks.

65
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,010
Our taste in ramen is the only thing we have in common.

66
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,040
Then, do you have different tastes in music?

67
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,170
F***! You want to die?

68
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,410
How dare you shove a pervert's music at me?

69
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,840
All right! I won't.

70
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,210
Hey, Otaku.

71
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,550
Games are your expertise.

72
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,500
Did this game previously exist?

73
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,500
No, I've never seen it before, either.

74
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,660
And I'm not an Otaku.

75
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,230
All right, sorry.

76
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,870
Anyway, what do we have to do to win this game?

77
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,160
It's the same as the mafia game.

78
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,530
You've never played it before?

79
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,190
Who doesn't know that, you f***?

80
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:06,590
You're the only one who knows if you're a civilian or the mafia until you die.

81
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:10,080
You need to find out who is what role in the other tea.

82
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,490
Doctors and police are on the same side as civilians.

83
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,830
The team that kills the other team first wins.

84
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,620
F***, when are we going to find all the mafia?

85
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,980
Hey,

86
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,550
what if we just kill whoever?

87
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,510
Then the game will end.

88
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,480
You said you're also a civilian.

89
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,780
We just need to kill all the mafia. Why kill everyone?

90
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,840
It says to kill them all, you dumbass.

91
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,120
Why would you kill your own team?

92
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,790
You can't even kill anyone. You're just bluffing.

93
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,260
You were freaking scared when others died...

94
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,740
You f***er! When was I ever scared-

95
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,030
Shit! Shut up, will you?

96
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,290
Choi Joo Won!

97
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,990
Why did he die if he was the mafia?

98
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,350
I don't really know, either.

99
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:12,120
It says the mafia must kill someone.

100
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,080
There must've been a reason that Joo Won was killed instead of a civilian.

101
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,560
What if a civilian kills the mafia?

102
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,420
Is that allowed?

103
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,660
That's not in the rules, so I don't know.

104
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:36,590
Let's just round up all the mafia and tell them to kill their own teammates.

105
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,540
- Good idea.
- Right? I'm a genius.

106
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,920
- Sounds good, right?
- Sounds good.

107
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,000
Gosh, you morons.

108
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,460
What part of that sounds good?

109
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,130
You think that'll work?

110
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:01,060
What if someone dies today like Choi Joo Won did?

111
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,270
We'll have to hide and lock the doors or something.

112
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,420
Are you going to vote?

113
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,400
We have to.

114
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,910
How many of us are mafia?

115
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,080
I don't know. It doesn't say.

116
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,700
Oh, yeah. The police!

117
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,930
The notice this morning said the police used his power. He must know, then!

118
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,240
Are you all really civilians?

119
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,600
There's no police here?

120
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,830
Hold on! It's so hectic.

121
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,560
If we'll really vote, let's call Joon Hee, too.

122
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,310
Go bring Joon Hee.

123
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,640
She should bring him herself.

124
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,400
What about Na Hee?

125
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,370
Who knows? She's probably sleeping in the infirmary.

126
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:07,030
Hey, Park Woo Ram! Bring Na Hee, too!

127
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,960
When I got hurt,

128
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,680
I should've said it hurt and convinced them to come back.

129
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,720
That wouldn't have happened if we came back right away.

130
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,370
No.

131
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,650
Even if you asked them to come back,

132
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:38,240
they could've just kept going.

133
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,210
It's not your fault.

134
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,630
Even so...

135
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,320
The fault lies with everyone.

136
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,810
Even when I saw Dong Hyeon die right before my eyes,

137
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,070
I couldn't do anything.

138
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,430
Hyeon Ho,

139
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,810
let's survive and get out of here.

140
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:13,300
I'll protect you, no matter what.

141
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,240
You will?

142
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,400
Once we escape,

143
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,310
I want to watch your game.

144
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,790
Just don't fall for me.

145
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:56,540
Why on earth do you think the person

146
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,340
who created the Mafia game is doing this?

147
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,200
We need to first figure out who created this game and why.

148
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,870
Where do you think the creator of this game is?

149
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,270
We're the only ones here right now.

150
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,210
What if they come once we fall asleep?

151
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,960
That's when they killed Joo Won, too.

152
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,460
They said the mafia killed Joo Won.

153
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,940
But our class students are the only ones on the participant list.

154
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,150
Any other participants would've been on the list.

155
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,980
You're right.

156
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,660
The mafia would've been selected when roles were being assigned.

157
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,420
Then...

158
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:48,400
does that mean one of us killed Joo Won?

159
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,540
If it's according to the rules,

160
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,160
I guess so.

161
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:06,850
In your opinion, who do you think the mafia are?

162
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:11,030
Seeing as how Choi Joo Won died, wouldn't it be Go Gyeong Joon's group?

163
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:14,570
She's right. They harassed Choi Joo Won all the time.

164
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:19,290
I think Jin Ha and Seung Bin even borrowed a lot of money from Choi Joo Won.

165
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,760
I don't know anything about Choi Joo Won.

166
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,490
But the mafia usually tries to kill citizens,

167
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,260
so we might be able to tell from yesterday's votes.

168
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,860
Let's kill Heo Yool first.

169
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,790
Wait, why are you looking at me?

170
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:48,730
Well, Eun Ha, you're the one who suggested we all vote off Heo Yool yesterday.

171
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,520
I just listened to you and voted.

172
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,740
Hey, Choi Mi Na!

173
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,540
Are you saying I'm a mafia?

174
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,620
Eun Ha,

175
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,300
why exactly did you accuse Yool of being a mafia?

176
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,870
It's not me.

177
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,140
Are you saying I intentionally killed Yool?

178
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,240
Yool got all the votes under your lead!

179
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,810
It's true!

180
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,170
That is true.

181
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,670
What's wrong with you guys?

182
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,080
Hey, Kim So Mi.

183
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,950
Then why did you do that?

184
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,290
Me?

185
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,430
Do what?

186
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,110
I saw you push Dong Hyeon in the mountains.

187
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,680
He died because of you!

188
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,650
Are you crazy?

189
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,560
I pushed him?

190
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,620
Hey, that's not true!

191
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:03,080
I almost died trying to grab Kim Dong Hyeon as he fell!

192
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,440
Everyone else saw it happen, so stop bullshitting!

193
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,890
Guys, I really had no idea. It was just a joke.

194
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,440
But she knew he'd die and still pushed him!

195
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,290
I told you I didn't.

196
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,780
Hey, call Joon Hee and the others.

197
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,550
Ask the other guys!

198
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,680
Hey! Both of you, that's enough.

199
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,830
Nice!

200
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,340
What are you doing?

201
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:47,180
We can eat with you once we've confirmed whether you're an ally or foe.

202
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,360
What are you saying? Give me my phone!

203
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,000
Is it good?

204
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,090
F***ing shit!

205
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,970
Stay the f*** still!

206
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,790
You're dead if you make me spill.

207
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,160
One hit per drop, got that?

208
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,560
[Ballot Box]
Shit.

209
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,470
It's the same as ours. The role doesn't show up.

210
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,020
Shit.

211
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,280
F***! I got some on me, you son of a bitch!

212
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,860
G-Give it back now.

213
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,730
Hold on. I still need to check something.

214
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,520
Check what?

215
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,280
If I can use someone else's phone to vote,

216
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,320
I can target the votes as I please.

217
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,400
Kneel!

218
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,240
Let go! Let go of me! Let go!

219
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,220
Hey,

220
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,900
choose someone. I'll press it for you.

221
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,640
I don't want to.

222
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,770
Then I'll vote for you.

223
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,610
Hey, stop it. S-Stop it!

224
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:09,820
I said, stop it! Stop it!

225
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,630
I said, stop it! Seriously, stop it-
[Will you vote for Jin Da Beom? / Yes]

226
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,670
[Voting has failed]

227
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:18,440
Shit, I guess you can't vote on someone's behalf.

228
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,920
Hey, I looked everywhere for you.

229
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,310
Let's go. Everyone's about to vote.

230
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:37,450
They're going to vote again after Yool died?

231
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,160
The game has to end for us to leave.

232
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,320
We have no choice.

233
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,490
Even so, how can we do that again?

234
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,600
We need to stop them.

235
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,320
We shouldn't vote.

236
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,100
How can we stop them?

237
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,190
We need a plan to persuade them.

238
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,150
I'll persuade them. Are they all gathered?

239
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,790
No, they're in several rooms.

240
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,490
Let's gather everyone first.

241
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,840
I'll help, too.

242
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,590
Where's Da Beom?

243
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,600
Go Gyeong Joon's group called him earlier.

244
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,780
Geez, those damn bastards.

245
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,010
They really get on my nerves.

246
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,260
I said, let go!

247
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,490
Hold on, will you?

248
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,100
Okay. Stay still.

249
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,320
F***, it doesn't work.

250
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,420
Hey!

251
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,610
That's enough.

252
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,990
What are you guys doing?

253
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,680
What the f***?

254
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,100
- Da Beom, get up.
- Get up.

255
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,130
Stand up.

256
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,470
One against three?

257
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,170
Aren't you embarrassed of yourselves?

258
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,860
Where do you think you're going?

259
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,330
Hey, hey, hey!

260
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,210
Hey, that's enough.

261
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,280
Come with us. We need to discuss something.

262
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,670
Why should I listen to you? Hey, you!

263
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,110
Damn it! Hey.

264
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,490
You motherf***er.

265
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,990
Why should I listen, you son of a bitch? Come here.

266
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,990
F***ing bastards.

267
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,100
Words don't get through to you, huh?

268
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,370
You need a beating.

269
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,600
You son of a bitch!

270
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,630
Son of a bitch!

271
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:09,070
Let the f*** go! Let go, you son of a bitch.

272
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,820
Will you listen?

273
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,570
Will you do as we say?

274
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,500
All right, you motherf***er!

275
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,820
Let's go.

276
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,530
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

277
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,760
Let the f*** go. Come here!

278
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:49,000
Hey! Just stop it, will you?

279
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,850
Should I tell everyone what you guys just did?

280
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,330
What will they all think?

281
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,220
Get it together.

282
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,360
Why are you wasting your breath?

283
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:09,140
I think they'll all start voting once we give them the go.

284
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,830
How about it?

285
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,320
Should I click your name?

286
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,470
You f***ing bitch.

287
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:17,010
Put this down.

288
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:20,510
We won't tell anyone, so put this down.

289
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,840
Just stop it now, please.

290
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,290
F***.

291
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,170
We'll all gather in the auditorium.

292
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,830
You guys should come, too.

293
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,200
Keep the snack bar open

294
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,870
for everyone.

295
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:23,170
[Participant List]

296
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,210
The reason we gathered everyone

297
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,860
isn't to choose who to vote for.

298
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,810
It's to convince you not to vote at all.

299
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,140
Don't vote at all?

300
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,080
Can we do that?

301
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,890
If we vote, someone will die, no matter what.

302
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,750
But if no one votes, everyone can live.

303
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,680
What if someone secretly votes after we all agree not to?

304
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,090
What happens then?

305
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,200
She's right. How can we trust everyone?

306
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,060
We'll have to make everyone trust each other.

307
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,840
We can collect all the phones so no one can vote.

308
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:00,150
Yeah, no one can vote if we collect all the phones.

309
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,500
We can do that.

310
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,430
Who's going to manage the phones?

311
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,720
That person might change their mind.

312
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,520
We can collect them and leave them in the middle for all to see.

313
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,210
Yeah, we can all keep an eye on them.

314
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,870
What if someone steals them?

315
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,220
I don't want to. I'm not handing mine in.

316
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:22,680
This sounds like a good idea. Let's hand in ours.

317
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,750
Are you crazy?

318
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,950
Who'd steal your phone? Just hand it in!

319
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,950
- I said, I don't want to!
- Are you a f***ing phone addict?

320
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,770
- Don't.
- What?

321
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,360
Why the f*** are you giving me shit?

322
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,690
No one will die if we hand them in.

323
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:37,680
You guys are f***ing noisy.

324
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:42,350
Class President is saying something right for f***ing once.

325
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,560
Why aren't you all cooperating?

326
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,520
You need to hand your phone in, so no one can vote.

327
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:54,150
Every one of you better hand them in.

328
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:58,080
Hand it in while I say it nicely.

329
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,960
What are you waiting for? Hurry up.

330
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,510
Come on, hurry up!

331
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,150
Hurry up. We're running out of time.

332
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:50,870
One minute left until voting ends.

333
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,060
Gosh...

334
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:03,120
Seriously, f***!

335
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,510
Hey, Class President! Are you sure this is okay?

336
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,200
Let's wait for now.

337
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,480
It's not even midnight yet.

338
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,320
Hey...

339
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,990
Hey, hey! It's past midnight, and there's no announcement.

340
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,670
Did... Did it work?

341
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,460
We're fine now, right?

342
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,470
We did it!

343
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,120
- We did it!
- We're okay!

344
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,950
We're okay!

345
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,840
We're okay now, right?

346
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:15,360
Participants must vote to track down the mafia.

347
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:29,470
Hey! What are you doing?

348
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,120
What do you think?

349
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,640
If I don't do anything and die, will you f***ing take responsibility?

350
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,090
She's right.

351
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,210
Guys, hold on! Hold on!

352
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,190
We don't know yet.

353
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,010
Know what?

354
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,980
The game will just progress as it did.

355
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,350
If we die because of you, will you take responsibility?

356
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,900
Hey, hey!

357
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,890
Don't blame Joon Hee for no reason, and calm down.

358
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:17,500
Lee Soo Bin and Park Ji Hoon will be executed for violating the rules.

359
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:41,360
Lee Soo Bin and Park Ji Hoon were civilians.

360
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,230
Everyone handed theirs in, right?

361
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:50,730
Participants must vote to track down the mafia.

362
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,660
What the f*** are you doing?

363
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,660
