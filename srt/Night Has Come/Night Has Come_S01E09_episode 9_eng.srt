1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,050


2
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,620
   

3
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,750
   

4
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,810
   

5
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,960
   

6
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,430
   

7
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,700
   

8
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,300
Ju Won, I'll be quick. 
    

9
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,000
Stand right there. Here we go.

10
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,930
   

11
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,960
Damn!

12
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,570
Here.

13
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,480
Let's kill him.

14
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,800
Will you be okay?

15
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,030
If Go Gyeong Jun dies, too, they'll suspect you immediately.

16
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,880
And if I don't kill him?

17
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,530
Do you think he will leave us alone?

18
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,620
That bastard knows I'm also a mafia.

19
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,010
What?

20
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,380
So everyone agrees to kill Go Gyeong Jun, right?

21
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,030
Now we must catch the police officer.

22
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,750
It's almost over.

23
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,120
   

24
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,780
Are you okay?

25
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,350
Yes.

26
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:02,030
 Go Gyeong Jun was executed by the mafia overnight. 

27
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:06,180
 Go Gyeong Jun was a civilian. 

28
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:12,450
 All participants, please locate the mafia and begin voting. 

29
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,410
Yesterday they were freaking out.

30
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,970
How did they die together?

31
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,910
I know.

32
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:34,430
Still, did he have to be killed so cruelly?

33
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:41,090
Let's move them for now.

34
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,200
I don't want to. I won't do it.

35
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,420
You can do it.

36
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,450
Hey, Kim So Mi, where are you going?

37
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,980
Let's go.

38
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,410
We agreed to stay together before the voting.

39
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,000
We can regroup at night.

40
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,450
It's weird being together. We don't even know who the mafia is.

41
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,310
We must find the mafia today.

42
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,210
If another civilian dies, we'll be fu***d.

43
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,050
Gosh, who could it be?

44
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,670
I've been thinking.

45
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,380
Something is strange.

46
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,590
Gyeong Jun and Jin Ha

47
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,880
died right after Yun Seo pointed them out.

48
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,940
What?

49
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,350
Are you saying Lee Yun Seo is a mafia?

50
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,760
Maybe she isn't.

51
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,170
Yet she keeps moving the bodies in a hurry, too.

52
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,560
I just think it's kind of weird.

53
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,250
I wish the police officer would step in at times like this.

54
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,520
Guys, who will you vote for?

55
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,870
I suspected Lee Yun Seo from the beginning.

56
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,440
She also brought up the CCTV and the ghost. I think…

57
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,650
she's preventing us from playing on purpose.

58
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:02,580
But she doesn't seem like someone who would lie.

59
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,550
How do you know that?

60
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,930
Go Gyeong Jun said she's a mafia, too.

61
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,770
He guessed Wu Ram was also a mafia. I'm sure he is right.

62
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,320
Don't you agree?

63
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,560
Mi Na.

64
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,220
- Oh? 
 - Don't you agree?

65
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,970
I don't know.

66
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,120
Let's talk for a second.

67
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,870
About what?

68
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,240
Come out for a second.

69
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,360
   

70
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,270
Now there are nine people left.

71
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,960
We must find the mafia member tonight.

72
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,490
What do we do?

73
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,140
Even if we survive tonight,

74
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,800
in the end, one of us will die tomorrow.

75
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,750
What if this was the game's mission?

76
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,990
If we find the host, we may be able to leave immediately.

77
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,920
Let's find the host first.

78
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,660
We must try everything we can.

79
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:16,740
Okay, but if we can't find the host by sundown, we'll find a Mafia member.

80
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,890
We can't vote for another civilian.

81
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,450
Yes.

82
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,960
We'd also be in danger if we couldn't find a mafia member.

83
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,810
Okay.

84
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,070
There may be something else besides this photo.

85
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,090
Let's look in here first.

86
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,250
What now?

87
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:50,260
Jin Da Beom. I think he's the mafia.

88
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,100
- Jin Da Beom? 
 - Yes.

89
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,560
Why?

90
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,330
Only three of us knew that we trapped Go Gyeong Jun in the warehouse.

91
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:06,040
Honestly, he was the only one among us who wanted revenge on Go Gyeong Jun.

92
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,620
We're the ones who suggested stealing the keys in the first place.

93
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:17,050
What if he tells everyone and they suspect us? What will we do then?

94
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,980
But there is a strange look in his eyes!

95
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,140
It's kind of creepy, like Park Wu Ram.

96
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,920
What?

97
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,730
What are you guys doing here?

98
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,100
What?

99
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,510
Aren't those Go Gyeong Jun's keys?

100
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,300
Yes, you see...

101
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,590
I saw him hiding them in the fire extinguisher box yesterday.

102
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,300
What?

103
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,010
Then why didn't you tell us?

104
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,470
What?

105
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,700
You guys.

106
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,410
No way…

107
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,000
You two tried to eat everything here, didn't you?

108
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,150
That's unbelievable.

109
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,940
Do you think everyone's like you?

110
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,490
Gyeong Jun had died, and we were hungry.

111
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,410
We did it because we were scared.

112
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,240
Yeon Wu, aren't you hungry?

113
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,690
I'm not hungry.

114
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,000
Yun Seo, can you open this with that key?

115
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,290
This isn't it.

116
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,620
What is it then?

117
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,480
Hold on.

118
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,320
It doesn't work.

119
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,510
Let's open it, just in case. We can break it.

120
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:25,150
Yes. There must be tools in the storage. I'll go get them.

121
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,710
 We'll give it back when we vote. 

122
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:08,850
   

123
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,010
 This is our class. 

124
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,970
   

125
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,860
   

126
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,600
Park Se Eun?

127
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,570
   

128
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,740
   

129
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,070
Park Se Eun?

130
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,710
Park Se Eun?

131
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,290
 Hey, Park Se Eun! 

132
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,470
   

133
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,090
 Park Se Eun? 

134
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,310
 The one who committed suicide? 

135
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,530
What is this?

136
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,390
Is this for real? 
    

137
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,560
Se Eun was the host.

138
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:44,020
S-Se Eun is dead.

139
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,160
But why…

140
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,550
You're right.

141
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,080
How can a dead person be the host?

142
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,620
It must be because of the game, too.

143
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,950
Our memories are back since Yun Seo found the host.

144
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,810
But still,

145
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:05,130
how could we lose and regain our memory?

146
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,260
This is driving me crazy.

147
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,940
Hold on.

148
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,890
So was the ghost you saw Park Se Eun?

149
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,380
Whatever. So all of this happened because of Park Se Eun?

150
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,930
Hey.

151
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,200
You found that photo.

152
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,900
Are you deliberately withholding information?

153
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,420
You were close to her!

154
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,500
Other than being in the same class, we had nothing to do with her.

155
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,410
Why should we go through this?

156
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,690
She's right.

157
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,060
I barely spoke to her.

158
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,760
- Me, too.
 - What's with Park Se Eun?

159
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,280
She's the one who killed herself. Why is she trying to kill us?

160
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,630
There was a rumor that it wasn't a suicide

161
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,710
and someone actually killed her.

162
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,300
Someone killed her?

163
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,780
I heard that, too.

164
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,230
Someone apparently pushed her.

165
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,350
Wasn't that just a rumor?

166
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:35,010
It was. The police also said it was a suicide.

167
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,120
What does it matter now? We have to worry about the mafia game.

168
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,480
Hold on.

169
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,460
Why did Se Eun start this game?

170
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:53,410
What if she didn't commit suicide as the rumor says,

171
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,310
and she's trying to tell us she was killed by one of us?

172
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:05,700
So are you saying that one of us killed Se Eun?

173
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,620
One of us?

174
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,680
What are you looking at?

175
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,030
How does that make sense?

176
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:22,320
What's the deal? Does it have something to do with the mafia?

177
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,970
Hey.

178
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,190
Who were the mafia?

179
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,710
 Wu Ram. Ju Won. Ye Won. 

180
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,860
We don't know the rest.

181
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:40,070
Hey, Park Wu Ram also killed Ju Yeong.

182
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:43,770
He said he wanted to kill her because she looked down on him.

183
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:49,200
Could he have killed Park Se Eun, too?

184
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:54,920
Those two. Did something happen between them?

185
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,620
Don't you guys know?

186
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,740
We don't know, either.

187
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,190
Park Wu Ram was into numerous girls.

188
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:06,930
I guess he made a move on Park Se Eun, too.

189
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,440
Then…

190
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,100
is this all Park Wu Ram's fault?

191
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,770
But…

192
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,070
if Wu Ram killed Se Eun,

193
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,210
what about the other mafia members?

194
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,280
What about them?

195
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,030
What is it?

196
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,330
What are you trying to say?

197
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,030
S-Se Eun.

198
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,930
Did Se Eun die because of us?

199
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,530
Are you crazy?

200
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,990
Why would you say that right now?

201
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:48,110
She wouldn't have died if it wasn't for that incident.

202
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:52,190
Let's go tell everyone and ask Se Eun to forgive us.

203
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,480
Then she might let us live.

204
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,030
What incident?

205
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:04,240
That was just a joke. It was nothing.

206
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,050
We didn't do anything wrong. Why—

207
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,860
Why do we have to apologize?

208
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,520
So Mi, let's just tell them. I'm so scared.

209
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,390
Please!

210
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,720
Shut up, Na Hui.

211
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,350
Okay?

212
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:31,260
If you tell them, they'll all vote for us.

213
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,700
Apology or no apology, we'll just die today.

214
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,990
So…

215
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:46,930
stop saying weird things and get it together.

216
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,830
Na Hui.

217
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,130
Wipe your tears before you come in.

218
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,710
What are you doing?

219
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,180
What if someone sees you?

220
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:28,910
I think Ahn Na Hui will cause trouble. What do we do?

221
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:32,220
- What trouble? 
 - Park Se Eun!

222
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,020
I think she'll talk about that incident.

223
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,960
What if everyone finds out?

224
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,690
So what about it?

225
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,340
Hey.

226
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,590
So you should've taken it easy.

227
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,330
Why did you bully her so openly?

228
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,250
- Hey! 
 - Ahn Na Hui…

229
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:57,180
is your f***ing responsibility.

230
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:01,500
You should've been more careful.

231
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,570
Didn't you get careless while you were busy with Choi Mi Na?

232
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:09,070
Fuck. You're the one who threatened her.

233
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,490
Now, you're acting as if it's none of your concern.

234
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:18,600
Who knows about it other than you?

235
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,790
What will you do when everyone who knows is dead?

236
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,100
I don't care about it anymore.

237
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:41,330
You damn loser. Do you want to die?

238
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:00,910
If the Park Se Eun story gets out,

239
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,790
we won't be able to protect you.

240
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,140
Behave yourself.

241
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,770
Fuck…

242
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,770
This is Gyeong Jun's.

243
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,510
I found it here.

244
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,290
I thought you guys should see it, too.

245
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,570
Why was it here?

246
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,090
I went to Jin Ha.

247
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,380
And Da Beom gave Gyeong Jun his phone back.

248
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:01,860
I think he hit the door with a chair.

249
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,680
It wasn't like this yesterday.

250
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,420
No.

251
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,100
Is it because of Go Gyeong Jun?

252
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,050
Something is strange.

253
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:23,330
Jin Ha and Gyeong Jun blamed each other for Seung Bin, and they both ended up dying.

254
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:30,110
What if the mafia planned to kill both of them from the beginning?

255
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,490
We all fell into their trap.

256
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,860
What took you so long?

257
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,310
I was so scared. I thought the ghost would come out.

258
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:58,200
Aren't you scared? Park Se Eun turned into a ghost, and she's forcing us to play the game.

259
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,410
Stop saying the word ghost. Seriously!

260
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,620
Why are you yelling at me?

261
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:11,740
Hey, we don't even know how the voting will go tonight. Who cares about the ghost right now?

262
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,970
So what do we do now?

263
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,990
Who will you vote for?

264
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,540
I've been thinking a lot, after hearing what you said.

265
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,630
Jin Da Beom…

266
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,610
is really suspicious.

267
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:48,100
The death of Gyeong Jun and the others and…

268
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,050
when we pretended Park Se Eun was invisible,

269
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,900
he kept talking to her. Don't you remember?

270
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,710
 Give that to me. 

271
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,380
You're right.

272
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:01,410
So everyone accused him of liking her.

273
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:08,500
Then should we vote for Jin Da Beom?

274
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:12,950
No.

275
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,790
If we vote for him now, everyone will suspect us because of the keys.

276
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:21,460
Then what are you suggesting?

277
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,150
Besides him…

278
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:32,360
there is another person I'm suspicious of.

279
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,790
Whom?

280
00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:00,670
Did you go to the second-floor storage room last night?

281
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,560
N-No. Why?

282
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,110
I found Gyeong Jun's phone there.

283
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:15,290
You're the last one that saw him yesterday.

284
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:19,390
I was wondering if you knew anything.

285
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,730
Well, I don't really know,

286
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,370
but I didn't go to him by myself.

287
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:30,630
I went with So Mi and Mi Na.

288
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,370
You did?

289
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:40,320
Didn't you guys see where Go Gyeong Jun went last night?

290
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:46,350
I knew it.

291
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:50,030
Hey, you lied about finding those keys, didn't you?

292
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,140
 Aren't those Go Gyeong Jun's keys? 

293
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,550
 Yes, the thing is… 

294
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,180
No.

295
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,720
We didn't lie.

296
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,420
What keys?

297
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,400
They had Gyeong Jun's keys.

298
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,320
I saw them in the snack bar earlier.

299
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,130
It's a misunderstanding.

300
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,640
I explained everything.

301
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,880
Tell us what happened then.

302
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,130
Gyeong Jun couldn't have just given you the keys.

303
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,950
I saw him hiding them in the fire extinguisher box. That's all.

304
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,600
Hey.

305
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,380
You guys didn't get along with Se Eun, either.

306
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,570
What do you mean?

307
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:34,550
You guys didn't talk to her and totally looked down on her.

308
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,040
When did we do that?

309
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,700
I've never done that.

310
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,920
Whoa, stop lying.

311
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,980
You girls always talked trash about her.

312
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,130
Eun Ha told me everything.

313
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,220
What the hell are you talking about?

314
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:56,000
The more I think about it, the more suspicious it is.

315
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,690
Aren't you guys…

316
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:00,290
the mafia?

317
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,260
Hold on.

318
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,080
To be honest,

319
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,810
I know…

320
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:25,040
who spread the rumor about Se Eun's weird video.

321
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,420
What?

322
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:44,280
 Kim So Mi voted for Ahn Na Hui. 

323
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:50,190
 Choi Mi Na voted for Ahn Na Hui. 

324
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,560
What are you guys doing?

325
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:57,550
She said Wu Ram showed her the video and…

326
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:02,590
I should've told her not to do that.

327
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,740
She's the one who spread the video, too.

328
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,880
Na Hui, did you do that?

329
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,510
Hey, was the video real?

330
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,240
Yes.

331
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,650
Ahn Na Hui spread the rumor and the video, too.

332
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,580
When did I do that?

333
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,500
You guys are the ones who made the video.

334
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,210
You're the one who hated Se Eun because of Jun Hui.

335
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:30,160
You started the rumor. Why are you framing me?

336
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,640
That's enough! Please!

337
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,630
Do we all have to die because of you?

338
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,350
It wasn't me…

339
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:05,890
Are you saying I'm the mafia?

340
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,260
Can you…

341
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,930
take responsibility for what you said?

342
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:21,270
You should be taking responsibility.

343
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,810
Okay.

344
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:26,400
We'll see who's telling the truth.

345
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:33,600
Now I can check your occupation, right?

346
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,460
How are you going to do that?

347
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,390
Just show it to them.

348
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,810
I'm a police officer.

349
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,860
What are you talking about?

350
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,400
Stop lying!

351
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:00,090
   

352
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:15,040


353
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,740
Now is the time to take responsibility.

354
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:34,630
   

355
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,130
   

356
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,610
