1
00:00:09,252 --> 00:00:12,662
(Lee Jae In, Kim Woo Seok, Choi Ye Bin)

2
00:00:13,292 --> 00:00:16,761
(Cha Woo Min, An Ji Ho, Jung So Ri)

3
00:00:27,071 --> 00:00:31,372
(Night Has Come)

4
00:00:31,442 --> 00:00:34,842
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

5
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:40,952
(in this drama are fictitious.)

6
00:00:42,122 --> 00:00:43,291
Take responsibility for what you said now.

7
00:00:45,192 --> 00:00:46,421
Are you the Police?

8
00:00:55,531 --> 00:00:56,632
Na Hee.

9
00:00:57,502 --> 00:00:59,301
I'm sorry. I was fooled by So Mi too.

10
00:00:59,302 --> 00:01:00,400
I knew you were not the Mafia.

11
00:01:00,401 --> 00:01:01,901
No. You're the same.

12
00:01:02,172 --> 00:01:03,172
No, Na Hee.

13
00:01:03,173 --> 00:01:06,112
I knew that you were not the Mafia. I believed in you.

14
00:01:06,382 --> 00:01:08,011
What the heck is going on?

15
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:12,922
No. Something must be wrong.

16
00:01:13,022 --> 00:01:14,252
Is that a reason why you used me?

17
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:16,821
- To kill Kyung Jun? - Hey.

18
00:01:17,022 --> 00:01:18,451
Yes, you crazy witch.

19
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:21,091
You said we should steal the key first.

20
00:01:21,491 --> 00:01:22,991
Did you kill Kyung Jun as well?

21
00:01:25,091 --> 00:01:27,062
- No. - The heck...

22
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:29,871
You did that to Eun Ha when you were the Mafia?

23
00:01:30,672 --> 00:01:32,871
If it hadn't been for you, she wouldn't have died.

24
00:01:33,642 --> 00:01:35,401
How can you do that if you're a human?

25
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:39,711
I had no choice.

26
00:01:42,951 --> 00:01:45,681
I just wanted to survive. Why?

27
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:52,091
I didn't want to become the freaking Mafia either.

28
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:55,422
Stop with your nonsense.

29
00:01:55,522 --> 00:01:56,632
Does it not matter as long as you survive?

30
00:01:58,832 --> 00:02:01,632
What about us? Do we deserve to die?

31
00:02:02,132 --> 00:02:03,132
Do we?

32
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:07,902
I didn't kill anyone.

33
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,271
The other guys killed them.

34
00:02:10,242 --> 00:02:12,912
What happened to Se Eun has nothing to do with me.

35
00:02:13,011 --> 00:02:14,011
Hey.

36
00:02:15,242 --> 00:02:17,182
Don't use Se Eun for your own sake.

37
00:02:17,782 --> 00:02:19,182
You don't deserve to do that.

38
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:21,622
Who are you to say that?

39
00:02:22,252 --> 00:02:23,652
No one believes you now.

40
00:02:24,592 --> 00:02:26,161
- Shut up. - Hey.

41
00:02:26,162 --> 00:02:27,192
Enough.

42
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:38,171
Jun Hee.

43
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,472
Save me. Please.

44
00:02:50,551 --> 00:02:52,282
Take responsibility as you said.

45
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:00,820
- Kim Jun Hee... - No.

46
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:03,592
voted for Kim So Mi.

47
00:03:04,162 --> 00:03:06,800
- No. - Oh Jung Won...

48
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:09,431
- Hold on. - voted for Kim So Mi.

49
00:03:09,432 --> 00:03:12,100
- Don't do it. - Ahn Na Hee...

50
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:14,841
- voted for Kim So Mi. - Don't vote.

51
00:03:14,842 --> 00:03:15,842
Give me the phone.

52
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:18,372
- Give me the phone. - Just stop.

53
00:03:33,722 --> 00:03:35,731
You're all fooled.

54
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:40,101
Do you know who the Mafias are?

55
00:03:54,382 --> 00:03:59,521
You can't reveal the identities of other Mafias to Citizens.

56
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:05,891
Darn it.

57
00:04:09,932 --> 00:04:11,161
You're doing all sorts of things.

58
00:04:11,562 --> 00:04:12,562
Hey.

59
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:15,732
Just die.

60
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:24,812
Im Eun Chan voted for Kim So Mi.

61
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:29,812
Nam Yeon Woo voted for Kim So Mi.

62
00:04:30,612 --> 00:04:31,852
Why did you do that?

63
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:35,622
You brought it on yourself.

64
00:04:38,492 --> 00:04:39,761
(Will you vote for Kim So Mi?)

65
00:04:43,632 --> 00:04:48,302
Lee Yoon Seo voted for Kim So Mi.

66
00:04:51,102 --> 00:04:53,102
We need to hide. Let's hurry up and go.

67
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:22,461
- Se Eun. - Voting is over.

68
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:26,401
With the most votes, Kim So Mi will be executed.

69
00:07:35,062 --> 00:07:36,602
(Ahn Na Hee is a Police Officer.)

70
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:40,102
(You can find out the identity of a selected participant.)

71
00:07:48,942 --> 00:07:49,981
(Jang Hyun Ho)

72
00:07:49,982 --> 00:07:52,080
(Will you use your Skill on Jang Hyun Ho?)

73
00:07:52,081 --> 00:07:53,081
(Yes.)

74
00:07:53,082 --> 00:07:55,081
(Jang Hyun Ho is a Citizen.)

75
00:07:59,821 --> 00:08:01,391
Hyun Ho.

76
00:08:20,442 --> 00:08:22,182
I know...

77
00:08:23,682 --> 00:08:24,752
your identity.

78
00:08:39,191 --> 00:08:40,632
(Will you use your Skill on Kim Jun Hee?)

79
00:08:40,862 --> 00:08:42,602
(Kim Jun Hee is a Citizen.)

80
00:08:44,002 --> 00:08:46,242
Yes, it's me. I'm the Mafia.

81
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,301
Just vote for that jerk and end this!

82
00:08:51,112 --> 00:08:52,541
(Kim Jun Hee)

83
00:08:53,712 --> 00:08:55,281
(Jun Hee is a Citizen. From Police)

84
00:09:42,161 --> 00:09:43,592
It's just you and me now.

85
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:47,862
Let's deal with the Police first.

86
00:09:56,572 --> 00:09:58,612
(Be mindful of your safety when cleaning the pool!)

87
00:10:00,681 --> 00:10:01,742
Yoon Seo.

88
00:10:02,882 --> 00:10:04,712
Wake up, Yoon Seo.

89
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,921
What's the matter? Did you have a dream?

90
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:23,430
During the night, Ahn Na Hee...

91
00:10:23,431 --> 00:10:25,771
was executed by the Mafia.

92
00:10:25,972 --> 00:10:29,842
Ahn Na Hee was a Police Officer.

93
00:10:30,112 --> 00:10:32,440
All participants,

94
00:10:32,441 --> 00:10:35,441
identify the Mafia and begin to vote.

95
00:10:38,452 --> 00:10:39,452
No.

96
00:10:41,181 --> 00:10:42,891
Darn it!

97
00:10:48,622 --> 00:10:49,661
Why?

98
00:10:50,661 --> 00:10:53,031
Why?

99
00:10:53,462 --> 00:10:54,632
Why?

100
00:11:09,952 --> 00:11:11,112
What do we do with Na Hee?

101
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:13,722
There's no Police now.

102
00:11:14,322 --> 00:11:15,551
How can we find the Mafias?

103
00:11:16,151 --> 00:11:19,421
We found out who had spread the rumor about Se Eun.

104
00:11:20,092 --> 00:11:21,322
Why is the game not over?

105
00:11:22,061 --> 00:11:23,791
Do we have to find all the Mafias to end this game?

106
00:11:25,492 --> 00:11:26,661
I don't know either.

107
00:11:27,261 --> 00:11:28,462
Oh, gosh.

108
00:11:48,722 --> 00:11:49,722
Hey.

109
00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:51,092
Se Eun!

110
00:12:01,761 --> 00:12:02,761
Hey.

111
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,901
There aren't many of us now.

112
00:13:13,141 --> 00:13:14,202
What do we do?

113
00:13:16,271 --> 00:13:18,612
Where are the other guys?

114
00:13:19,112 --> 00:13:20,141
Are they upstairs?

115
00:13:21,781 --> 00:13:22,842
I didn't see them.

116
00:13:23,311 --> 00:13:24,911
Mi Na and Da Bum...

117
00:13:25,911 --> 00:13:27,082
are nowhere to be seen.

118
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:30,391
Are they planning a strategy?

119
00:13:31,122 --> 00:13:32,691
The three of them stole the key.

120
00:13:33,061 --> 00:13:34,061
Those jerks.

121
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:36,832
Who are they going to kill this time?

122
00:13:37,531 --> 00:13:38,531
Hey.

123
00:13:39,362 --> 00:13:41,061
Don't we have to prepare something as well?

124
00:13:41,931 --> 00:13:43,031
Prepare what?

125
00:13:44,472 --> 00:13:47,002
We should do something to stop the Mafias from killing us.

126
00:13:47,301 --> 00:13:48,742
We should tie our limbs while sleeping...

127
00:13:48,872 --> 00:13:51,472
so that no one can move. We should do something like that at least.

128
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,712
Let's talk about it when everyone gathers.

129
00:14:07,862 --> 00:14:09,261
Did you get changed?

130
00:14:33,011 --> 00:14:35,151
- Why? - What's the matter?

131
00:14:40,322 --> 00:14:42,661
You told me how to find blood last time.

132
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,462
I want to find this instead of blood.

133
00:14:51,002 --> 00:14:52,271
Na Hee asked me...

134
00:14:54,271 --> 00:14:55,372
to find out who killed her...

135
00:14:56,411 --> 00:14:58,112
if she died.

136
00:15:00,582 --> 00:15:04,051
I don't know who I should trust. So I called you out only.

137
00:15:07,222 --> 00:15:08,952
The Mafias will come to kill me first.

138
00:15:10,092 --> 00:15:11,122
Help me.

139
00:15:11,492 --> 00:15:12,992
Okay, I will.

140
00:15:13,051 --> 00:15:14,122
Let's hide first.

141
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,521
Not that.

142
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:17,891
Help me find out who they are.

143
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:19,431
What?

144
00:15:19,832 --> 00:15:22,161
Just like how Yoon Seo identified the footprint,

145
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:24,301
if we're prepared beforehand...

146
00:15:24,431 --> 00:15:26,572
to figure out the identity of Mafias when they came to kill me,

147
00:15:27,102 --> 00:15:28,202
you will be able to find out.

148
00:15:34,181 --> 00:15:36,212
I had many chances,

149
00:15:37,551 --> 00:15:38,911
but I ruined them all.

150
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:42,680
If I had used my Skill as the Police,

151
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:44,322
I would've saved the others.

152
00:15:46,051 --> 00:15:47,561
I ruined everything.

153
00:15:50,092 --> 00:15:51,161
Jun Hee.

154
00:15:52,332 --> 00:15:54,232
I want to do it properly this time.

155
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:07,112
Thank you, Jun Hee.

156
00:16:07,742 --> 00:16:09,411
I'll come to take you in the morning.

157
00:16:11,811 --> 00:16:12,852
See you tomorrow.

158
00:16:57,362 --> 00:16:59,062
We mixed air freshener with neon paint.

159
00:17:00,961 --> 00:17:02,931
The one who killed Na Hee must have the paint on their shoes.

160
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:13,582
(Jin Da Bum)

161
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:18,312
Did Na Hee really ask you to do this?

162
00:17:18,911 --> 00:17:20,882
- It's not a lie? - Right.

163
00:17:22,282 --> 00:17:23,522
Na Hee's dead too.

164
00:17:23,891 --> 00:17:25,522
How can we believe you?

165
00:17:56,151 --> 00:17:57,191
Do you believe me now?

166
00:17:59,022 --> 00:18:00,891
There's no reason to object if you're not Mafia.

167
00:18:01,421 --> 00:18:02,461
Am I wrong?

168
00:18:23,112 --> 00:18:24,451
Does that actually work?

169
00:18:53,171 --> 00:18:54,681
What's this? Why is it glowing?

170
00:19:00,221 --> 00:19:01,221
It's her.

171
00:19:01,852 --> 00:19:02,981
No wonder.

172
00:19:03,622 --> 00:19:05,891
I found it weird when she wanted to steal Kyung Jun's keys.

173
00:19:08,421 --> 00:19:11,161
No, this isn't right. It wasn't me.

174
00:19:11,632 --> 00:19:12,891
Did you kill Na Hee?

175
00:19:13,532 --> 00:19:14,802
I didn't kill her!

176
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:17,572
How could I kill her when I didn't know where she was?

177
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:19,200
Why is it on your shoe if you didn't kill her?

178
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:21,401
How the heck would I know that?

179
00:19:22,641 --> 00:19:24,012
I'm a Citizen.

180
00:19:24,471 --> 00:19:25,941
- Can you prove it? - What?

181
00:19:26,641 --> 00:19:28,082
Is there proof...

182
00:19:28,882 --> 00:19:29,911
you're a Citizen?

183
00:19:33,651 --> 00:19:35,022
I think we found a Mafia.

184
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:37,292
Let's vote now.

185
00:19:38,951 --> 00:19:40,262
Have you all lost your minds?

186
00:19:41,092 --> 00:19:43,122
It's not me. I'm a Citizen.

187
00:19:43,362 --> 00:19:45,160
We agreed to vote tonight.

188
00:19:45,161 --> 00:19:46,191
Why?

189
00:19:46,491 --> 00:19:48,401
Why wait when we're sure it's her?

190
00:19:48,862 --> 00:19:49,961
Let's vote now.

191
00:19:50,072 --> 00:19:52,132
Get your hands off me!

192
00:19:52,802 --> 00:19:54,401
How many times must I say it wasn't me?

193
00:19:54,842 --> 00:19:57,112
You haven't yet explained how you took Kyung Jun's keys.

194
00:19:57,971 --> 00:19:59,410
So Mi put me up to...

195
00:19:59,411 --> 00:20:00,882
As if she did.

196
00:20:01,782 --> 00:20:03,681
You tried to gang up on me and kill me.

197
00:20:03,852 --> 00:20:04,852
No.

198
00:20:05,451 --> 00:20:07,521
So Mi used me just the same.

199
00:20:07,522 --> 00:20:08,852
Let's calm down.

200
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:10,751
Give me that.

201
00:20:11,592 --> 00:20:12,651
Show me the bottom.

202
00:20:21,532 --> 00:20:23,061
If she were really there,

203
00:20:23,062 --> 00:20:24,532
the paint would be on the bottom too.

204
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:27,171
It's weird how it's just a bit to the side.

205
00:20:28,441 --> 00:20:30,812
Someone could've got it on her. We can't be sure.

206
00:20:30,911 --> 00:20:32,512
(Jin Da Bum)

207
00:20:36,751 --> 00:20:37,751
Yes.

208
00:20:38,282 --> 00:20:39,711
Let's vote tonight as planned.

209
00:20:40,882 --> 00:20:42,522
We should vote when we're all up for it.

210
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:52,491
Jun Hee.

211
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:07,842
- Get the light. - Okay.

212
00:21:10,651 --> 00:21:11,651
(Keep off during daytime)

213
00:21:20,691 --> 00:21:21,721
Look.

214
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:24,562
The paint's everywhere,

215
00:21:25,161 --> 00:21:27,201
but there was just a drop on Mi Na's shoe.

216
00:21:27,961 --> 00:21:30,201
Everyone else's shoes were clean.

217
00:21:31,632 --> 00:21:33,772
The Mafia could've come in barefoot.

218
00:21:34,441 --> 00:21:35,700
(Oh Jung Won)

219
00:21:35,701 --> 00:21:36,872
That's possible.

220
00:21:59,691 --> 00:22:01,762
Look at this. There's something here.

221
00:22:02,832 --> 00:22:03,901
Step down for a second.

222
00:22:11,812 --> 00:22:13,171
- Turn on the light. - Okay.

223
00:22:18,352 --> 00:22:19,382
It's blood.

224
00:22:20,552 --> 00:22:21,552
Blood?

225
00:22:22,782 --> 00:22:23,822
Yes.

226
00:22:26,022 --> 00:22:28,092
I'd say someone was badly hurt.

227
00:22:29,461 --> 00:22:31,292
Na Hee had no wounds.

228
00:22:32,792 --> 00:22:33,802
Then...

229
00:22:34,401 --> 00:22:35,661
whose blood is that?

230
00:22:53,451 --> 00:22:55,951
Can you go check on Mi Na?

231
00:22:57,451 --> 00:22:59,151
I'll talk to Jun Hee.

232
00:23:00,391 --> 00:23:01,391
Okay.

233
00:23:05,491 --> 00:23:06,491
Jun Hee.

234
00:23:08,102 --> 00:23:11,731
(Muryeong Retreat Center)

235
00:23:17,072 --> 00:23:19,971
The Mafia could've gotten hurt while looking for Na Hee.

236
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:23,410
I don't think...

237
00:23:23,411 --> 00:23:25,651
it's right to corner Mi Na because of her shoes.

238
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:28,782
Okay.

239
00:23:30,522 --> 00:23:31,721
We'll check,

240
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,552
but if we don't find anything,

241
00:23:34,562 --> 00:23:36,262
we'll vote for Mi Na anyway.

242
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,431
Jun Hee.

243
00:23:41,161 --> 00:23:44,501
The Mafia could be using her like they did Jin Ha.

244
00:23:45,832 --> 00:23:47,440
We'll miss out on getting them again.

245
00:23:47,441 --> 00:23:49,572
The evidence points to Mi Na right now.

246
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,641
We can't let the Mafia be in control forever.

247
00:23:56,012 --> 00:23:57,012
Jun Hee.

248
00:24:01,181 --> 00:24:02,852
I'm sick of seeing people die.

249
00:24:09,092 --> 00:24:10,431
Let's get out of here.

250
00:24:13,491 --> 00:24:16,062
Let's go home, Yoon Seo.

251
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:24,341
If it's only on her shoe,

252
00:24:24,342 --> 00:24:25,612
then it must be her.

253
00:24:27,082 --> 00:24:28,342
Darn Yoon Seo.

254
00:24:29,711 --> 00:24:30,711
My point exactly.

255
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:32,911
What's the point in waiting until tonight?

256
00:24:41,161 --> 00:24:42,161
Why are you here?

257
00:24:44,931 --> 00:24:46,231
I brought some food...

258
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:49,032
because I thought you'd be hungry.

259
00:24:52,872 --> 00:24:54,171
My gosh...

260
00:24:56,641 --> 00:24:57,941
Are you hungry, Yeon Woo?

261
00:24:58,241 --> 00:24:59,342
Have some ramyeon.

262
00:25:01,112 --> 00:25:02,181
Get lost!

263
00:25:04,552 --> 00:25:07,122
You got soup all over your shoes.

264
00:25:11,391 --> 00:25:12,522
What are you doing?

265
00:25:14,421 --> 00:25:15,421
I don't mind.

266
00:25:19,832 --> 00:25:21,701
Yeon Woo, I swear I'm not Mafia.

267
00:25:22,602 --> 00:25:25,332
I really am not. Will you help me out?

268
00:25:28,872 --> 00:25:30,771
Shouldn't you believe me at least?

269
00:25:30,772 --> 00:25:32,240
We used to be friends.

270
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:33,981
Don't vote for me, Eun Chan.

271
00:25:34,711 --> 00:25:35,881
I'm not Mafia.

272
00:25:35,882 --> 00:25:38,651
You and So Mi made Eun Ha look like Mafia and killed her!

273
00:25:39,512 --> 00:25:42,121
No, that was because she said we should vote for Yul.

274
00:25:42,122 --> 00:25:44,220
I had no choice but to vote. I'm really not Mafia.

275
00:25:44,221 --> 00:25:47,091
Guys, let's talk. Will you hear me out?

276
00:25:47,092 --> 00:25:49,262
- Get lost! Go! - Please.

277
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:06,112
What jerks.

278
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:08,612
Wait and see what I do.

279
00:26:14,251 --> 00:26:15,322
Choi Mi Na.

280
00:26:25,661 --> 00:26:26,661
You mean...

281
00:26:27,201 --> 00:26:29,602
the person who got hurt in the toilet is the Mafia?

282
00:26:30,332 --> 00:26:31,332
Yes.

283
00:26:32,302 --> 00:26:34,701
We're not sure yet, so keep it to yourself.

284
00:26:35,102 --> 00:26:36,572
Don't tell the others.

285
00:26:37,671 --> 00:26:38,671
Okay.

286
00:26:40,012 --> 00:26:43,612
Hey, look over my body. I have no wounds.

287
00:26:44,852 --> 00:26:46,611
Look. I wasn't hurt.

288
00:26:46,612 --> 00:26:47,951
- I'm really not... - Okay.

289
00:26:48,451 --> 00:26:49,481
I got it.

290
00:26:56,191 --> 00:26:57,931
Thanks for helping me, Jung Won.

291
00:27:02,161 --> 00:27:05,272
I really wanted to be friends with you.

292
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:06,971
And Yoon Seo too.

293
00:27:07,941 --> 00:27:08,970
Just like that?

294
00:27:08,971 --> 00:27:11,711
No. I'd wanted to be friends for a long time.

295
00:27:12,971 --> 00:27:15,711
It feels like I finally got to know you.

296
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:17,552
It's so nice.

297
00:27:28,322 --> 00:27:30,322
You should keep this.

298
00:27:30,931 --> 00:27:32,792
I'll just follow you around.

299
00:27:35,262 --> 00:27:36,332
Why give me this?

300
00:27:37,062 --> 00:27:39,031
Because we're both Citizens.

301
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:41,501
Why would I give it to you if I were the Mafia?

302
00:27:41,842 --> 00:27:42,901
I'm not stupid.

303
00:27:48,941 --> 00:27:51,012
Will you believe me just this once, Jung Won?

304
00:27:52,112 --> 00:27:53,651
I'm not the Mafia.

305
00:28:06,161 --> 00:28:08,862
I didn't see any wounds on Mi Na's body.

306
00:28:09,862 --> 00:28:12,772
We talked for a while and I didn't notice anything odd.

307
00:28:14,171 --> 00:28:15,901
I'll check the others.

308
00:28:19,911 --> 00:28:21,981
The Mafia kept deceiving us.

309
00:28:24,651 --> 00:28:25,651
How about...

310
00:28:27,112 --> 00:28:28,481
we do the same?

311
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:30,251
What?

312
00:28:30,522 --> 00:28:31,552
How?

313
00:28:34,461 --> 00:28:37,062
What if we say we found a camera Na Hee set up in secret,

314
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,532
but it's dead so we're charging it?

315
00:28:40,661 --> 00:28:43,562
They'll do anything to destroy it like they did the camera footage.

316
00:28:46,971 --> 00:28:49,272
We found a camera Na Hee set up before she died.

317
00:28:49,802 --> 00:28:52,441
We're charging it and we'll soon find out who's Mafia.

318
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,181
Let's meet up in 30 minutes.

319
00:29:02,421 --> 00:29:03,851
(We found a camera Na Hee set up before she died.)

320
00:29:03,852 --> 00:29:05,420
(We're charging it and we'll soon find out who's Mafia.)

321
00:29:05,421 --> 00:29:07,262
(Let's meet up in 30 minutes.)

322
00:29:12,491 --> 00:29:14,430
(Kim Jun Hee)

323
00:29:14,431 --> 00:29:16,001
(Jin Da Bum)

324
00:29:18,471 --> 00:29:20,700
We'll separate the two most suspicious people...

325
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:22,042
and create a situation.

326
00:29:25,911 --> 00:29:27,612
They'll have to show themselves.

327
00:29:38,191 --> 00:29:39,322
Do you think it'll work?

328
00:29:40,352 --> 00:29:42,221
We must force them to make a move.

329
00:29:43,191 --> 00:29:44,191
Yes.

330
00:29:45,332 --> 00:29:46,391
Let's do it.

331
00:29:56,272 --> 00:29:57,312
Hey.

332
00:29:58,572 --> 00:30:00,012
Where's the camera?

333
00:30:01,542 --> 00:30:03,681
Oh, we're charging it in the cafeteria.

334
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:08,751
I'll go out for a bit.

335
00:30:09,251 --> 00:30:10,451
Okay. See you.

336
00:30:18,832 --> 00:30:20,032
Darn it.

337
00:30:27,102 --> 00:30:28,872
Let's wait in the cafeteria.

338
00:30:46,651 --> 00:30:47,792
Is it done charging?

339
00:30:48,391 --> 00:30:49,460
Where do we meet?

340
00:30:49,461 --> 00:30:50,660
In the cafeteria.

341
00:30:50,661 --> 00:30:51,991
We're on our way now.

342
00:30:52,332 --> 00:30:53,362
I'll come with you.

343
00:30:55,262 --> 00:30:57,201
Where's Nam Yeon Woo?

344
00:30:59,332 --> 00:31:01,741
He went to the infirmary saying he felt sick.

345
00:31:02,941 --> 00:31:05,372
The person who got hurt in the toilet is the Mafia?

346
00:31:06,042 --> 00:31:07,140
Yes.

347
00:31:07,141 --> 00:31:08,711
Get your hands off me!

348
00:31:27,931 --> 00:31:28,931
Look.

349
00:31:29,731 --> 00:31:30,931
Why would you check...

350
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,701
What are you doing?

351
00:31:46,651 --> 00:31:48,052
What are you doing? Let's see.

352
00:31:50,122 --> 00:31:51,251
Look at this.

353
00:31:54,322 --> 00:31:55,491
Nam Yeon Woo.

354
00:31:56,961 --> 00:31:58,431
What's that cut?

355
00:31:58,961 --> 00:32:00,191
It's nothing.

356
00:32:00,691 --> 00:32:03,062
(Jin Da Bum)

357
00:32:03,161 --> 00:32:05,201
(No file)

358
00:32:07,001 --> 00:32:08,001
Why is it blank?

359
00:32:09,042 --> 00:32:10,572
What's that cut?

360
00:32:11,572 --> 00:32:12,842
I got hurt.

361
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:18,012
Why? Were you afraid it caught you?

362
00:32:18,852 --> 00:32:20,782
No, it's not that.

363
00:32:22,451 --> 00:32:24,552
Something's not right.

364
00:32:26,622 --> 00:32:27,920
Get over here, Mafia scum.

365
00:32:27,921 --> 00:32:30,362
- You psycho! - Let him go.

366
00:32:33,532 --> 00:32:35,362
Guys, it's not like that.

367
00:32:36,532 --> 00:32:37,671
It's not.

368
00:32:45,141 --> 00:32:46,911
Darn it.

369
00:32:47,512 --> 00:32:49,441
