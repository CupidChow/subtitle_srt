1
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,580
   

3
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,760
   

4
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,830
   

5
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,010
   

6
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,450
   

7
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,710
   

8
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,590
   

9
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,280
What's this?

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,660
It says I'm a civilian. How about you?

11
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,720
Me, too.

12
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,280
   

13
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,730
   

14
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,060
   

15
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,040
Ji Su.

16
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,410
   

17
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,780
   

18
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,250
I can't touch her...

19
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,560
   

20
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,540
   

21
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,940
   

22
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,550
Ji Su...

23
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,200
Ji Su...

24
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,190
 I don't want to die. 

25
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,900
 You won't die. 

26
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,910
 I won't ever let you die. 

27
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,270
 We have to go home. 

28
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,920
 Aren't you going to? 

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,230
 I want to. 

30
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,140
 It's me. 

31
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,450
 I'm the mafia. 

32
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,140
 You're not. 

33
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,420
 You really aren't! 

34
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,700
 Don't do it. It's not Jun Hui! 

35
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,910
   
 Don't! 

36
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,330
   

37
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,240
 Hey... 

38
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,230
 Take it back. Say you aren't! 
   

39
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,050
   

40
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,760
Did you find the photo album?

41
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,580
It wasn't on the first floor.

42
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,160
No.

43
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,440
It was definitely here.

44
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,810
It must be somewhere. Let's look further.

45
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,870
 - Cha Yu Jun has died.  
 - Yu Jun?

46
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,950
 - Cha Yu Jun was a doctor.  
 - But why?

47
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:25,640
 All participants, please find the mafia and begin voting. 

48
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,540
He didn't break the rule, either.

49
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,580
But why? Why...

50
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,430
Did he fall?

51
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,830
He didn't fall.

52
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,080
Someone killed him.

53
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,860
There are many signs of resisting,

54
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,740
and he has a lot of wounds on his head.

55
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,120
Someone attacked him.

56
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,220
The mafia must've killed him.

57
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,460
I don't know about this...

58
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,890
Even if they were mafia, this isn't right.

59
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,510
It's not even nighttime yet. Why would they kill someone?

60
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,810
What will you do now?

61
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,150
We need to find out who did it.

62
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,770
Why do you think Yu Jun came here?

63
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,760
Yun Seo.

64
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,580
The crazy mafia bastards.

65
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,710
They kill people during the day now?

66
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,480
Even if Yu Jun was a doctor,

67
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,050
this is going too far.

68
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,410
Let's just catch the mafia bastards. Fuck.

69
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:57,400
Seriously, who was it? Shit!

70
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,690
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

71
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,430
What?

72
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,740
- Come here. 
 - Geez, why?

73
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,750
What's this?

74
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,160
What is it?

75
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,760
   

76
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,130
Jun Hui and you are the mafia?

77
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,940
N-No, I'm really not the mafia.

78
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,400
Guys, I'm really not... I'm a civilian.

79
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,330
Who wrote this? I'm really not.

80
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,890
The police officer used the ability twice.

81
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,820
So there being two mafia seems right.

82
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,080
But they said Jun Hui was a civilian earlier.

83
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,680
I'm not the mafia, either.

84
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,970
Don't lie.

85
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,980
The police must've written it again because the one earlier was fake.

86
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,790
Yes. The true police officer should reveal the mafia, not a civilian.

87
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,360
No.

88
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,180
This might be fake.

89
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,110
It's weird it appeared right after Yu Jun died.

90
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:12,120
The one who killed Yu Jun might be trying to frame them as the mafia.

91
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,850
You two. What took you guys so long to get back?

92
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,190
Maybe you guys wrote this.

93
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,550
If we did, Yun Seo wouldn't have said what she did.

94
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,400
Fuck, what's this?

95
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:36,390
Police Officer, cut the bullshit and come clean.

96
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,190
Take out your phones. Let me check your abilities.

97
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,470
That won't be necessary.

98
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,100
I think I know...

99
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,350
who killed Yu Jun.

100
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,220
You said you'd tell us who it was.

101
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,290
Why did we come here?

102
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,350
In the warehouse,

103
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,890
I found a footprint.

104
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,890
This was found next to it.

105
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,800
I think it fell off the shoe of the person who killed Yu Jun.

106
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,760
These match, too.

107
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,170
I remembered because it was disconnected in the middle.

108
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,500
It was because of this.

109
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,460
This is usually used for basketball shoes.

110
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,140
Basketball shoes?

111
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,010
What? Why?

112
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,900
Are these yours?

113
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,830
Crazy bitch, what the hell are you talking about?

114
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,050
Let me see your shoes. Let's check.

115
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,300
Fuck. I don't use stuff like that.

116
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,720
We can check, then.

117
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,520
Fuck it. Take a look at them.

118
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,890
They don't match.

119
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,350
Fuck. I said I don't use those.

120
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,060
What? What?

121
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,400
It's not me, either. Why do you keep being suspicious of me?

122
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,160
You can just show them if you're innocent.

123
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,740
- Yes. Let's look. 
 - No! I didn't do it!

124
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,320
I said I didn't do it!

125
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,980
Don't do it, you bastards!

126
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,080
Damn.

127
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,230
Who bit you?

128
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,780
Fuck.

129
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,080
It really was you, wasn't it?

130
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,310
Why did you it?

131
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,110
No.

132
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,270
I didn't kill him.

133
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:17,130
We found the murder weapon, too. Don't lie.

134
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,730
Fuck.

135
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,810
Do you want me to tell you the truth?

136
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,190
Go Gyeong Jun, this bastard killed him. I didn't do it!

137
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,740
Crazy bastard, what are you saying? If they found the shoe print and the brick, it's obviously you!

138
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,980
How did you know that?

139
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,490
I didn't say it was a brick. How did you know?

140
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,740
What?

141
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,210
There was someone other than Jin Ha in the warehouse.

142
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:45,420
There was another footprint with the same pattern without the padding.

143
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,390
That was you, right?

144
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,420
Go Gyeong Jun...

145
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,700
Guys, it really wasn't me.

146
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,180
This bastard killed him.

147
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,140
He killed Seung Bin, too.

148
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,270
You have the fucking ax, too.

149
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,600
You crazy bastard. Son of a bitch.

150
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,550
You, motherfucker!

151
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,080
Hey, stop!

152
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,630
Stop that, I said!

153
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,040
Let go of me! You killed him, motherfucker!

154
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,800
Let go! Let go, I said.

155
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:20,010
- Gyeong Jun! 
 - Let go. Let go! Fuck.

156
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,050
You crazy bastard!

157
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,830
Stop.

158
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,020
Let go. Get lost, fuck!

159
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,290
You son of a bitch!

160
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,130
Jun Hui!

161
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:45,200
Motherfucker! Come at me. Fucker!

162
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,800
Come at me! Come at me, you son of a bitch!

163
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,060
Fuck!

164
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,980
Fine. Move.

165
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,960
Hey.

166
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,900
What the fuck is that?

167
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,180
You've got to be kidding me.

168
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,810
You wrote with that, didn't you?

169
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,010
Will you still say he's not the mafia?

170
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,240
He wrote it 100%.

171
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,540
What's this? Did you write who the mafia is?

172
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,900
No. I didn't do it.

173
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,330
Hey, guys. Hold on.

174
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:39,270
Hold on. Don't! I...

175
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,330
I've never seen this before! Jun Hui.

176
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,640
We have the damn answer. Vote now.

177
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,410
Jun Hui, it wasn't me.

178
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:52,350
Hey, you're the class president!

179
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,160
I really don't know what this is.

180
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,190
Guys, please. Jeong Won, please... wait a minute...

181
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,410
What a freaking joke.

182
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,980
This is so unfair.

183
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,780
This bastard is the mafia 100%. Vote for him and be done with it!

184
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,950
That's enough!

185
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,090
You killed Yu Jun, too.

186
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,330
We'll vote at 11 p.m.

187
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,970
You both go to your rooms.

188
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,730
You'd better not leave your rooms.

189
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,500
Damn. What is this, a prison cell?

190
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,510
What?

191
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,770
- Give me the keys. 
 - Why?

192
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,000
What if you run away?

193
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,330
We don't know if you'll kill someone again.

194
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,650
We'll share the snack bar now. Hand them over.

195
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,150
I don't have them. I lost them.

196
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,040
Stop bullshitting and hand them over.

197
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,940
Fuck. I said I don't have them.

198
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,330
Give me your phone, then. We'll keep it as collateral.

199
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,550
You can't go anywhere without your phone.

200
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:18,860
You two killed someone. You need to do this for us to trust you.

201
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,450
Fuck. Da Beom.

202
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,140
We'll give it back when we vote.

203
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,340
Guys.

204
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,840
I'm really not the mafia.

205
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,790
I didn't kill Seung Bin.

206
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,740
Don't vote for me. Please?

207
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,490
I-It really isn't me.

208
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,060
I'm a civilian.

209
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,020
I need to live for you to live.

210
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,400
Hey. T-This is the men's room.

211
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,440
I know.

212
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:32,950
- What?
- What do you think is the safest place here?

213
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,410
What are you talking about?

214
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:38,730
Go ahead and answer. What is it?

215
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,800
I'm not sure.

216
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,780
Gosh, you're so slow.

217
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,400
It's the snack bar.

218
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,740
- The snack bar? 
 - Yes.

219
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,290
You can't break the shutter even with an ax.

220
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,590
So?

221
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,610
What do you mean, "So"?

222
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:56,460
Let's take Go Gyeong Jun's keys.

223
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,830
We'll include you.

224
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,800
Let's do it together.

225
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,900
- Did it hurt? 
 - I'm okay.

226
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,370
Are you okay?

227
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,910
Yes.

228
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,490
Thank you.

229
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,090
Let's go if you're done putting on the ointment.

230
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,610
They'll get suspicious again if we get back late.

231
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,280
Okay.

232
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,150
Yes. Let's go.

233
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,510
Let's go.

234
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,430
   

235
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:07,020
   

236
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,780
We really need to vote now.

237
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,850
What do you want to do?

238
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,290
No matter what, I think Gyeong Jun is a civilian,

239
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,990
but we don't know what Jin Ha is.

240
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:34,320
Then we should let Gyeong Jun live.

241
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,750
But Go Gyeong Jun is weird, too.

242
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:41,650
Why would he kill the doctor if he was a civilian?

243
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,810
Right. He had an ax too.

244
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,790
Geez, are you stupid?

245
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,670
He has the keys. Why would he destroy the door?

246
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,620
Do you have a hole in your head?

247
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,040
He must've intentionally broken it, so we don't suspect him.

248
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,780
Fuck, you don't even know.

249
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,840
No.

250
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,510
Jin Ha is even more suspicious.

251
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:10,420
He pretended to be a police officer and wrote down names.

252
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,070
I know.

253
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:18,080
Jin Ha borrowed a lot of money from Ju Won, too, to buy a lotto.

254
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,590
He could've killed him so he doesn't have to pay him back.

255
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,690
That's it.

256
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,580
Yun Seo.

257
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,430
Who do you think is the mafia?

258
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:36,160
There's actually something that bothers me.

259
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,580
What is it?

260
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:43,950
When the mafia kills someone, they say "executed."

261
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:47,350
But why did they say Yu Jun "died"?

262
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:50,530
It could be because he died during the day,

263
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:56,720
but what if both Jin Ha and Gyeong Jun are civilians?

264
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,820
What would we do then?

265
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,300
Why are you making it so complicated?

266
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,410
They killed Yu Jun together.

267
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,940
Just...

268
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,490
tell them not to vote.

269
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,150
No.

270
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,300
If we kill everyone that way, we'd be no different from them.

271
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,000
Yes. Don't be so ridiculous.

272
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,620
Why doesn't the police officer use their power then?

273
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,670
Save whoever is the civilian between them.

274
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,770
That's right.

275
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,910
That'd be the best way.

276
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,580
No.

277
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,470
The doctor died, too.

278
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,760
The police officer must feel pressured right now.

279
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,430
Don't force them.

280
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,240
They sent us a message, too.

281
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,600
Things got more complicated because of that.

282
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,620
It's okay. It's okay.

283
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:52,500
 Let's decide who we'll vote for first. 

284
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:25,850
 We've all decided, then. Okay? 

285
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,150
By the way,

286
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,790
what about these?

287
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,950
We should give them back.

288
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,030
We need to tell them the voting result, too.

289
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,750
Then...

290
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,070
who will take these to them?

291
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,730
Do you want all of us to go?

292
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,530
I'll do it.

293
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,380
You guys can vote and hide.

294
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:58,280
I'll take the phones to them once everyone hides.

295
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,820
I'll come with you.

296
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,840
We can each give one back.

297
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,080
Take it.

298
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,570
Go Gyeong Jun, son of a bitch.

299
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,200
   

300
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,910
   

301
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,370
What about you?

302
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,380
Did you vote?

303
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,570
Fuck.

304
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:26,490
   

305
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,610
   

306
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:28,760
   

307
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,040
Please...

308
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,710
Jun Hui...

309
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,770
Jun Hui. I swear...

310
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,270
I swear I'm not.

311
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,650
I'm a civilian!

312
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,470
Please spare me just once.

313
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:48,200
I really don't want to die. Please?

314
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,200
- Jun Hui, please...
- Jin Ha.

315
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:59,030
I'm sure Yu Jun wanted to live, too.

316
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:50,990
   

317
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:53,890
That's why you should have had insurance.

318
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,670
What did you say?

319
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,200
Nothing.

320
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,660
Tell them to bring my phone.

321
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,830
We don't have your phone.

322
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:15,090
Tell us where the keys are. I'll give it to you then.

323
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,910
Are you crazy, you son of a bitch?

324
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,960
You'll never find it on your own.

325
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,740
You know what happens if you don't vote, right?

326
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,750
Where are the keys?

327
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:34,390
Our Da Beom is all grown up now.

328
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:38,250
You know how to threaten people, too.

329
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,910
Follow me. There's no time.

330
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,900
Go.

331
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,200
What? I-It's not here.

332
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,440
Happy now?

333
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,440
Give me my phone now.

334
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,200
You should've told me you needed the keys.

335
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,690
You scared me for no reason.

336
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,460
Where is it?

337
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,270
Over there.

338
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,450
You go get it.

339
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,810
How do I know if that's real or not?

340
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,480
Do whatever you want. I'm leaving.

341
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,500
Bring it to me, you motherfucker.

342
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,460
There's no time. Will you be okay?

343
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,900
Having fun, you motherfucker?

344
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,750
Hey, open it.

345
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,260
Open it, you son of a bitch! Fucker!

346
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,330
 Open it! Open it, you son of a bitch! 

347
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,070
Open it, you son of a bitch!

348
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:25,540
 Hey, open it! Hey! 

349
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:29,070
You fucker! Jin Da Beom, you motherfucker!

350
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,940
I'll kill you when I get out. You fucker!

351
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,850
Open it! Fuck.

352
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,270
Shit.

353
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:37,880
Hey, Jin Da Beom! Fuck!

354
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,620
Hey! Fuck.

355
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,160
Damn!

356
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,220
 The voting has ended. 

357
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:18,350
 Kim Jin Ha, the one with the most votes, will be executed. 

358
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,460
Fuck.

359
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,540
No!

360
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:25,680
 Kim Jin Ha was a civilian. 

361
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,110
What? Kim Jin Ha was a civilian.

362
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,270
He was a civilian?

363
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,970
Fuck. We're screwed.

364
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,400
Mafia bastards. I'll kill you tomorrow.

365
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:26,100
I'll kill you, you motherfucker.

366
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,440
How does it feel to be bullied by a loser?

367
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,720
It feels like shit, right?

368
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,420
Gyeong Jun.

369
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,330
The mafia...

370
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:14,420
unanimously chooses a target.

371
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,390
Everyone's coming.

372
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:26,310
You motherfucker!

373
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,360
Shit.

374
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,670
You fuck!

375
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,880
Son of a bitch.

376
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:07,450
Hey! Die. Fuck.

377
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:31,340
Fuck! Time's up, you idiot.

378
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:35,460
It fucking hurts. That motherfucker.

379
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:06,190
What the fuck?

380
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:14,140
What the fuck? Stop!

381
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,950
Shit.

382
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:27,490
He fucking scared me.

383
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:59,040
Gyeong Jun, when people die,

384
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,090
they say hearing is the last sense you lose.

385
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:19,280
Think of me while listening to this.

386
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:39,970


387
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:47,890
   

388
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:54,360
   

389
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,890
