Then, we can all get out of here, and no one has to die.

00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,840
Why do we have to go through this?

183
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,450
Let's come clean.

184
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,840
Speak up if you're the mafia.

185
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,930
Would you speak up if it were you?

186
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,890
F*** you.

187
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,730
Then let's do it again.

188
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,260
Who do you think is definitely the mafia?

189
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:05,400
The police should at least speak up. The police!

190
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,160
Come clean!

191
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,300
I don't think the police will speak up, either.

192
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,160
Of course, they won't.

193
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,330
F***, why won't anyone f***ing cooperate?

194
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,190
Hey, Class President. It's you, isn't it?

195
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,010
You didn't let us vote, so all the civilians died.

196
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,950
This was the mafia's scheme to kill civilians, wasn't it?

197
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,900
What are you saying?

198
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,900
Didn't you see the notice?

199
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,210
Civilians weren't the only ones who died. The mafia died, too.

200
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,920
At least we can guess who the doctor is.

201
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,470
It's not me!

202
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,310
It's not me, either.

203
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,770
It is you two.

204
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,170
Who else would save Cha Yoo Joon if not you two?

205
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,890
I don't know why they used it on me, either. But it's really not me!

206
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,960
[Baek Eun Ha | 10 votes]

207
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,840
Hey, Kim So Mi.

208
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,010
Eun Ha said you were the mafia yesterday.

209
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,110
Did you choose her because she exposed you?

210
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,790
Hey, I...

211
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:36,330
I had no choice but to choose her since she tried to vote for me!

212
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,150
What about you? Are you the mafia?

213
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,410
W-What about me?

214
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,310
Joo Young.

215
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,810
You two had a big argument yesterday.

216
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,560
An argument is an argument!

217
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,610
Why would I kill her over that?

218
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:58,470
You acted like a maid in front of Joo Young

219
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,250
but cursed her behind her back, saying she was annoying.

220
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,470
Maybe you wanted to kill her.

221
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:08,060
T-That's not true!

222
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:12,810
I guess Lee Joo Young did keep bossing Choi Mi Na around.

223
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,640
I said that's not true!

224
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,580
You talk too f***ing much.

225
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,860
Come clean before you see blood.

226
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,430
Go Gyeong Joon.

227
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,470
Why'd you do that, then?

228
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,940
Do what, you f***er?

229
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,190
Why were you the only one who hid your phone?

230
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,830
You knew the kids would die if we didn't vote

231
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,640
and you kept quiet so they would all die, huh?

232
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,460
I told you...

233
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,680
how could I trust that bastard?

234
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,420
Why did you force us to trust him when you couldn't?

235
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,370
You're the one who killed Lee Joo Young, you bastard.

236
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,390
You think I didn't know?

237
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,150
What?

238
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:20,750
You were shit on online after you confessed your feelings to Lee Joo Young and got rejected.

239
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:25,040
- Joo Young and I were just joking-
- Stop bullshitting, you dumbass!

240
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,050
You got on your knees and begged Lee Joo Young to take it down.

241
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,760
Is there anyone here who doesn't know about that?

242
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,840
Hey, Choi Mi Na! Speak up. You recorded that.

243
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,390
Y-Yeah.

244
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,230
How does that matter right now?

245
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:44,270
It f***ing matters since you're the mafia, you motherf***er!

246
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:48,420
You trashed Lee Joo Young behind her back, calling her a sly fox.

247
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,580
You killed Choi Joo Won first since it would be obvious

248
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,270
if you killed Lee Joo Young right away, didn't you?

249
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,410
That's not true.

250
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:58,530
H-How could I be the mafia? I-It's you!

251
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,690
F*** you.

252
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,100
F***...

253
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:10,630
Go Gyeong Joon has voted for Park Woo Ram.

254
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,940
I'm not! Don't do it!

255
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,600
- I can tell from his eyes. He's the mafia.
- Hey, hey! Hey!

256
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,310
Hey, hey! Hey!

257
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,220
[Will you vote for Park Woo Ram? / Yes]

258
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,440
Shin Seung Bin and Kim Jin Ha

259
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,970
have voted for Park Woo Ram.

260
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:38,390
Hey, you sons of bitches!

261
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:43,130
Hurry up and vote for this bastard, too.

262
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,970
Hey, Choi Mi Na! This bastard is pretty pissed with you, too.

263
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:49,910
Since Lee Joo Young died, it's your turn today.

264
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:59,200
Hey. Hey, Go Gyeong Joon!

265
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,190
Move!

266
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:09,130
How dare the motherf***er try to kill me?

267
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:20,330
Hey, you don't think they'll turn against us, do you?

268
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:23,040
That's nonsense.

269
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,460
There are 15 people left.

270
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,840
Even if the three of us vote for Park Woo Ram,

271
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,610
a lot more kids haven't voted yet.

272
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,180
F***, should we get insurance?

273
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:55,590
Hey, where are you going? Hey!

274
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,840
Guys...

275
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,100
Guys, where are you going?

276
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,890
Hey!

277
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,310
Wait, wait!

278
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,410
We should talk before you go.

279
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:20,180
We can gather after a little rest.

280
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,570
What?

281
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:47,830
Choi Mi Na has voted for Park Woo Ram.

282
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,460
Choi Mi Na!

283
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,270
What the hell?

284
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,520
What?

285
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:57,080
After some thought, Go Gyeong Joon has a valid point.

286
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,940
No wonder...

287
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,540
The way he was looking at Joo Young yesterday was freaking off.

288
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:10,200
- What?
- That crazy bitch!

289
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,440
Hey, Woo Ram!

290
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,760
Don't. I'll convince her.

291
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,240
Aren't you hungry?

292
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,090
Hey, Ji Soo!

293
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,890
You're really not a doctor, right?

294
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,920
I'm not.

295
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,080
I know. I trust you.

296
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:06,360
- But who in the world-
- I said, I'm really not!

297
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,620
- Trust me.
- Yoo Joon,

298
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,200
I'm really confused right now.

299
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,740
What's going on?

300
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,850
What happened?

301
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,760
Go Gyeong Joon got the better of us.

302
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,020
I should've stopped them from voting.

303
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,500
Even if you had, would they have listened?

304
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,880
Instead of sitting here like this,

305
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,840
shouldn't we at least ask the others to vote for someone else?

306
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,540
Who would you suggest they vote for?

307
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,590
I don't know!

308
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:49,860
As long as it's not one of us.

309
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,820
We just need to know who the mafia is.

310
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:02,420
You think they wouldn't vote for you just because you save Park Woo Ram?

311
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,430
They'll do whatever it takes to stay alive.

312
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,520
The fact that Baek Eun Ha got targeted,

313
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,830
Park Woo Ram and Kim So Mi made that happen.

314
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,710
You should get revenge.

315
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:20,110
Hey, we need to stick together.

316
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:25,420
You even get a free pass to the snack bar. How great is this?

317
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,680
Huh?

318
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:37,310
Park Woo Ram, that bastard, is definitely the mafia.

319
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:42,140
He's getting upset because he's guilty of something.

320
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,640
Eat.

321
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,640
Hey, eat up. It's going to get soggy.

[Im Eun Chan has voted for Park Woo Ram.]
[Nam Yeon Woo has voted for Park Woo Ram.]

323
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,460
What the hell is this?

324
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,810
- What's with them?
- Those bastards...

325
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:14,660
How could they do this to me? Huh?

326
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:22,120
Yeah, Ji Soo and Yoo Joon are on our side.

327
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,430
It'll be all right. Don't worry.

328
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,490
I'll find a way.

329
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,920
Okay?

330
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,550
A way?

331
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,370
F***!

332
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,730
There's no other choice.

333
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,950
It's either Go Gyeong Joon or me now.

334
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:44,500
One of us has to die for this to end. Am I wrong?

335
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,730
Let's do the same thing as him.

336
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,770
Let's vote for Go Gyeong Joon.

337
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,240
What?

338
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,590
He's always harassing the kids.

339
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:01,010
That son of a bitch deserves to die.

340
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,150
That bastard will do anything to stay alive.

341
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:15,660
Fine, let's say it's me today. What about tomorrow?

342
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,390
Who will he choose tomorrow?

343
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,730
It's one of you guys!

344
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,110
Is it Go Gyeong Joon or me?

345
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,740
Make your choice.

346
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,650
Woo Ram is right.

347
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,850
I'll vote for Go Gyeong Joon.

348
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:38,140
Me, too.

349
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,230
Judging by his actions yesterday, he's no good.

350
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,050
I'll vote for him, too.

351
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,570

353
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,790
If you don't help me, I'm going to die.

354
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:04,870

355
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,030

See?

360
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:32,900
I knew this would happen. Shit.

361
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:41,620
That crazy bastard has a death wish.

362
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,180
Only Yoo Joon and Ji Soo are left, right?

363
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,170
Yeah, they should be in their room.

364

Okay.

I'll go.

It's a bit scary here.

369
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,760
Must you go inside?

370
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,900
We don't even know what's there.

371
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,460
All the more reason to.

372
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,160
I'll be quick.

Okay.

376
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,450
Hey, Lee Yoon Seo!
