(Cha Woo Min, An Ji Ho, Jung So Ri)

(Director: Im Dae Woong)

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,549
(Night Has Come)

6
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,388
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

7
00:00:33,389 --> 00:00:34,749
(in this drama are fictitious.)

8
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:09,220
Yoon Seo. Are you okay?

9
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:37,618
Before the last vote closed,

10
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,789
Police used their Skill.

11
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,558
During the night, Park Ji Soo...

12
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:45,660
was executed by Mafia.

13
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:49,630
Park Ji Soo was a Citizen.

14
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,198
All participants,

15
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:55,170
identify the Mafia and begin to vote.

16
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,869
It's on again.

17
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,670
Can we even get out of here?

18
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:03,179
We must.

19
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,409
Let's find a way out and go home.

20
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,420
Yes.

21
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:16,790
Let's go outside.

22
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:50,119
Ji Soo.

23
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:53,760
Ji Soo.

24
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,429
Ji Soo.

25
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,670
Ji Soo, no.

26
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,540
Ji Soo.

27
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,540
Ji Soo.

28
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,980
(Let's Focus on Safety!)

29
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:28,490
Why did you want to see us all?

30
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,439
"Park Woo Ram was Mafia."

31
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,369
See? What did I tell you?

32
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,350
Ko Kyung Jun has a great hunch.

33
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,450
What's the Police doing?

34
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,490
Learn from him.

35
00:03:54,589 --> 00:03:55,589
Did you see that?

36
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,520
If you want to catch the Mafia, do as I say.

37
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:01,730
What do we do?

38
00:04:02,899 --> 00:04:05,928
You'll take turns saying who you think is Mafia,

39
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:07,129
and I'll pick for you.

40
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,540
Why do you get to decide?

41
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,740
We should decide together.

42
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:14,869
Yes. Who do you think you are?

43
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:19,379
Didn't you see Woo Ram try to kill me last night?

44
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,319
Who other than me is definitely Citizen?

45
00:04:28,749 --> 00:04:30,019
I think...

46
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,460
Mafia's among the people who voted for me yesterday.

47
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:35,660
No.

48
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,860
We're really not Mafia.

49
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:41,829
You sided with Woo Ram and tried to kill me.

50
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:44,139
What clearer evidence is there?

51
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,369
We really didn't know.

52
00:04:46,809 --> 00:04:48,439
Don't judge based on last night.

53
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,639
Then what should I judge you on?

54
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,550
You're the only people who voted for me.

55
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,850
Is that it?

56
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:57,050
Your logic is crap.

57
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,579
- Hey. - What?

58
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,819
Stop it.

59
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:03,160
What about Ji Soo, then?

60
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,058
Why kill someone we were all friends with?

61
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:07,329
We had no reason to.

62
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,170
Who cares how close you are when you could die?

63
00:05:20,369 --> 00:05:21,939
Wasn't Ji Soo a Doctor?

64
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,240
Read the notice properly.

65
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,009
It says she was a Citizen.

66
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,879
Yu Jun must be the Doctor.

67
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,220
He pretended not to be.

68
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,350
Yesterday,

69
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:35,790
the Police used their Skill, so why didn't the Doctor?

70
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,790
Yes. If they'd used their Skill,

71
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:42,460
Ji Soo could've lived.

72
00:05:48,869 --> 00:05:52,439
On the third floor, weren't Ji Soo and Yu Jun alone?

73
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,569
Then why kill just Ji Soo?

74
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,809
Could Cha Yu Jun be Mafia?

75
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,710
Darn it.

76
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:02,780
He killed his girlfriend?

77
00:06:03,179 --> 00:06:04,879
That's really freaky if it's true.

78
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,050
Ji Soo did give him a hard time.

79
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,290
Always telling him off.

80
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,069
You lot are so frustrating.

81
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:31,110
I'll pick someone for you.

82
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,679
He thinks he's in charge.

83
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:36,319
Kim Jun Hee's Mafia.

84
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,220
You can tell when he got the ax and went crazy to save Woo Ram.

85
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,720
He did it to save him thinking he was a Citizen.

86
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,329
We were all betrayed by someone we trusted.

87
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,129
He really got us good.

88
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,530
We're victims too.

89
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:58,300
Yes. I don't think we should vote for Jun Hee just because of that.

90
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:00,470
Then shall I pick one of you?

91
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:03,340
Go and vote already.

92
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,809
Hey.

93
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,449
Don't you know about presuming innocence?

94
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:10,879
Don't insist when you don't have proof.

95
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:12,749
What?

96
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,220
We're not voting for whom you dislike most.

97
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:17,920
This is just like a witch hunt.

98
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:23,360
My hunch is proof, darn it.

99
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:27,499
Is there proof he's not Mafia?

100
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:28,900
There isn't.

101
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,509
Proof?

102
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:41,710
There's proof.

103
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,780
There's a surveillance room in the basement.

104
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,019
I'm sure everything was filmed.

105
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,300
We can get the Mafia in one go.

106
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,369
That's awesome.

107
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,069
Mensa, work faster. You're so darn slow.

108
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,670
It's "Mensan."

109
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:10,040
I just turned it on. Wait.

110
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:16,350
What's this? Hang on.

111
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:18,920
What's wrong?

112
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,819
There are no files. Someone deleted them.

113
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,889
Are they saved somewhere else? Look again.

114
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,430
It's not that. They're really gone.

115
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,830
It wasn't even formatted automatically.

116
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:32,730
Someone deleted them on purpose.

117
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,369
Lee Yoon Seo. What's going on?

118
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,539
You trolled us all.

119
00:08:38,869 --> 00:08:41,570
Gosh, you Mafia jerks.

120
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,210
Nice team-play. Did you delete them?

121
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:46,109
It's not like that.

122
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,350
As if it isn't.

123
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,680
You and Jun Hee defended Woo Ram from the start.

124
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:53,119
You showed up late because you deleted the files.

125
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,888
You're just pretending you didn't.

126
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:56,820
- It's not like that! - Lee Yoon Seo.

127
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:02,759
How did you know you could see the footage from here?

128
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,360
What?

129
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:07,570
You knew because you went looking to delete the files.

130
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:09,169
No?

131
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,570
What...

132
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,839
I came across this place by chance.

133
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,878
If she'd deleted the files, why would she have brought us here?

134
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:19,440
Yes. And she doesn't know how to do this.

135
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,480
It's game over.

136
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,918
- I voted. - Hey, Ko Kyung Jun!

137
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,819
- Ko Kyung Jun... - Wait.

138
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,649
voted for Lee Yoon Seo.

139
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:32,418
Kim Jin Ha, Shin Seung Bin...

140
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:35,289
voted for Lee Yoon Seo.

141
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:40,200
Cha Yu Jun voted for Lee Yoon Seo.

142
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:41,470
Guys, wait.

143
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,669
I'm really a Citizen.

144
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,009
I'll prove that I am.

145
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,539
Give me until today. Please.

146
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,850
Yoon Seo really isn't Mafia.

147
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:57,649
I'll restore the files.

148
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,180
Give me some time.

149
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,288
Yes. We can vote later at night.

150
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:04,319
Right.

151
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,490
Once the files are restored, we'll know who's Mafia.

152
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,529
Okay.

153
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:13,700
Let's go.

154
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:32,919
Yoon Seo.

155
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:36,589
I'll restore the files by 11pm.

156
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,860
Let's vote then.

157
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,830
So, we're gathering at 11pm?

158
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:44,460
Yes. She'll restore the footage and show us.

159
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:47,700
She's doing all she can to stall.

160
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:51,899
It would be awesome if something was filmed.

161
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:54,210
Yes. That would be clear-cut.

162
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:11,690
(Jang Hyun Ho)

163
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,259
I should've voted for Yoon Seo then.

164
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:19,200
Why?

165
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,199
Because of Woo Ram,

166
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
Kyung Jun suspects us too.

167
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:27,110
It's easiest to go with the flow.

168
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:30,779
Shall we just vote now?

169
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,110
What if we do and she's a Citizen?

170
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:35,950
What?

171
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,080
That makes us murderers.

172
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,049
What'll you do then?

173
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,889
Who cares?

174
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:46,330
It can't be helped.

175
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,560
So what?

176
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,200
You'll keep doing what Kyung Jun says?

177
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:55,499
If he tells you to pick me or Jun Hee, will you?

178
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,799
Hey, don't say that.

179
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:00,539
To be honest,

180
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:03,840
how do we know who's Mafia and who's a Citizen?

181
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,480
So Mi, you just...

182
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:11,080
don't like Yoon Seo, that's why.

183
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:20,190
Hey.

184
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:25,259
Are you Mafia?

185
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,570
What?

186
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:31,600
You've been really close with Yoon Seo and Jung Won lately.

187
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,779
I'm wondering if it's because you're all Mafia.

188
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,879
Kim So Mi.

189
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,149
Stop it.

190
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,480
So Mi, don't go too far.

191
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,220
She's not doing well because Hyun Ho's dead.

192
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,629
Hey, Na Hee.

193
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,259
Are you sulking?

194
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,830
Ahn Na Hee!

195
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:12,680
Jung Won.

196
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,409
Can you restore the files by 11pm?

197
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:17,580
No.

198
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,619
I can't restore them all. I must pick a few from yesterday.

199
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,930
Hey. I didn't say I can't do it.

200
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,629
I'll restore the clip from the third-floor hallway.

201
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:33,200
Yes. Let's not worry too much.

202
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:35,570
I'm sure Jung Won can manage.

203
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,700
Do you have a laptop?

204
00:13:41,369 --> 00:13:42,369
Why?

205
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,610
Let's use yours too. Go get it.

206
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,340
Okay.

207
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,470
Hey.

208
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,999
I'll go check something.

209
00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:12,970
Where are you going?

210
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,369
Keep working on this.

211
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,480
The security cameras were on yesterday.

212
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,519
I saw the guys in their rooms.

213
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:29,590
But there are no cameras in the rooms.

214
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:33,190
It's so weird.

215
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,799
I found this too.

216
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,100
Jun Hee.

217
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,240
I'm really not lying,

218
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,110
and I didn't hallucinate.

219
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:52,539
Yoon Seo.

220
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:55,909
I believe you.

221
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,680
Let's do all we can.

222
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,019
Is the room connected to something else?

223
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:07,159
I have to look again.

224
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,499
- Okay, let's go. - No.

225
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,769
I'll go on my own. It's too narrow for you.

226
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:16,200
You'll be scared on your own.

227
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,200
And you'll need a witness.

228
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:20,409
I'll go in first.

229
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:38,019
Watch your step.

230
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,529
Jun Hee.

231
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,499
What would you do...

232
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:56,909
if I were Mafia?

233
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,379
It doesn't matter.

234
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,950
Why doesn't it matter?

235
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,350
I won't vote for you anyway.

236
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,850
We reached the end.

237
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:40,649
It's blocked.

238
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,820
What? Look carefully.

239
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,990
I fell through the floor.

240
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:49,659
The floor's firm too.

241
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,319
It's weird, you know.

242
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,660
Ever since I came here,

243
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:20,160
I've been dreaming of myself dying.

244
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,559
It was just a dream.

245
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:26,400
But I was scared.

246
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:30,440
I often got sick.

247
00:17:31,269 --> 00:17:32,339
So I...

248
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,609
did think...

249
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,579
I might die.

250
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:44,180
But dying here like this?

251
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:48,420
I've never imagined it.

252
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,559
Jun Hee.

253
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,930
I don't want to die.

254
00:17:57,099 --> 00:17:58,200
You won't die.

255
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:01,630
I'll never let you die.

256
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,499
We should go home. Don't you want to go home?

257
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:11,710
I do.

258
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,579
I want to go home.

259
00:18:17,349 --> 00:18:18,380
Yes.

260
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,950
And don't worry even if we can't restore the footage.

261
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,190
We can find another way.

262
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,430
Yoon Seo.

263
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:38,339
Do you think there will be another proof?

264
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,370
Another proof?

265
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:52,880
(Rebuild communication.)

266
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:16,880
What is it?

267
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,410
Blood.

268
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:20,009
I saw it in a book.

269
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:22,778
You can see it with this light.

270
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:23,849
What?

271
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,789
The door is locked.

272
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,390
So they would've broken it with an ax.

273
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:33,559
This blood must be Woo Ram's that was on the ax.

274
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,829
His blood might be on the person who touched the ax as well.

275
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,430
Then...

276
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:41,630
it means we can find who it is if we check everyone.

277
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,599
But his blood got splashed on me when I was next to him yesterday.

278
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,910
The same thing might've happened to the other guys too.

279
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:50,479
So we can't be sure.

280
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,150
Even if there's blood on them, we don't know if it's Woo Ram's.

281
00:19:55,349 --> 00:19:57,450
Innocent people might be suspected for no reason.

282
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,660
I think we can restore the security camera footage on the third floor.

283
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,220
- It's done. - What?

284
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,288
The footage from yesterday is restored.

285
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:36,089
All we should do is check who entered Ji Soo's room.

286
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:37,859
Where is it?

287
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:41,930
It's glitching.

288
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:48,499
- What's this? - What's the matter?

289
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:51,069
What is wrong?

290
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,209
- It's dangerous. - No.

291
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,879
- My gosh. - What's this?

292
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,909
- No. - Darn it.

293
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,410
- Move over. - It's fire.

294
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:19,200
Were you freaking trying to burn all of us to death?

295
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:21,069
It really wasn't me.

296
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:31,710
Hey. What's that?

297
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,018
- Darn it. - Oh, no.

298
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:42,620
What's that? Is that real?

299
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,559
I think there really is a ghost.

300
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:48,759
This is unbelievable.

301
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,730
Look.

302
00:21:57,269 --> 00:21:58,399
Look at this.

303
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,009
She's the ghost in the footage.

304
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:06,640
I think...

305
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:11,220
there really is something other than us.

306
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:15,890
That ghost must have to do something with the Mafia Game.

307
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:20,288
Stop with your nonsense.

308
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:22,089
It's a fake video you guys made.

309
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,559
You idiot. Look at the timecode.

310
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,430
It's filming in real time.

311
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,799
Then...

312
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,309
will you play the game that kills people as they say?

313
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,480
What if you win?

314
00:22:42,749 --> 00:22:45,650
Do you think we can survive and get out of here?

315
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:50,690
Do you still think you can even after seeing how others died?

316
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,289
Get a grip.

317
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,259
We should find out who made us play the game.

318
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,269
If we only find the relation...

319
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:09,670
between the ghost and the Mafia Game,

320
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:13,509
we might be able to get out of here for real.

321
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:24,759
(No diving)

322
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:40,440
Hey. It's almost midnight. Will you not vote?

323
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,839
How about we vote...

324
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:48,079
in a different way?

325
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,980
Jun Hee, we don't have time right now.

326
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:53,849
How can we do it differently?

327
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,390
You almost killed us all. What nonsense are you saying now?

328
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:59,518
Right, you stupid class president.

329
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:01,329
We almost died because we listened to you.

330
00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:03,359
We can listen to him first before we decide.

331
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:07,400
What is it? Tell us.

332
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,700
Out of 13 votes, Yoon Seo received 4.

333
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,740
You die when the majority votes for you. Otherwise, you won't die.

334
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,339
We can divide the remaining votes...

335
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:22,380
so that she isn't voted by the majority.

336
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:25,778
So you want to make another person receive four votes like Yoon Seo...

337
00:24:25,779 --> 00:24:27,220
to make it a tie.

338
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:29,890
Yes.

339
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:33,220
That way, all of us will vote...

340
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,690
without abstaining.

341
00:24:37,829 --> 00:24:38,930
But...

342
00:24:39,829 --> 00:24:41,299
who will become the one to receive the same number of votes?

343
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:51,779
Vote for me.

344
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:55,579
What?

345
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:03,519
(Will you vote for Kim Jun Hee?)

346
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,589
(Jin Da Bum voted for Kim Jun Hee.)

347
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:06,588
Jin Da Bum...

348
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:08,429
voted for Kim Jun Hee.

349
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,788
- Voted. - Kim Jun Hee...

350
00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:11,828
voted for Oh Jung Won.

351
00:25:11,829 --> 00:25:13,429
- Voted. - For...

352
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:16,729
- Voted for Nam Yeon Woo. - Nam Yeon Woo...

353
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:19,940
voted for Im Eun Chan.

354
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:23,608
Ahn Na Hee and Oh Jung Won...

355
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:26,579
voted for Kim Jun Hee.

356
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,248
Lee Yoon Seo...

357
00:25:29,249 --> 00:25:32,180
voted for Kim Jun Hee.

358
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:38,019
A minute left to vote.

359
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:43,859
Choi Mi Na voted for Kim So Mi.

360
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:49,130
Kim So Mi voted for Choi Mi Na.

361
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:53,700
Voting is over.

362
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,640
(Voting is over.)

363
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,180
It worked.

364
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:04,579
It worked. It actually worked!

365
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,549
Are you sure it worked?

366
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,690
- Did it really work? - It worked.

367
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:11,220
It worked.

368
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:14,089
We did it.

369
00:26:16,289 --> 00:26:17,430
Let's go.

370
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:24,139
As Lee Yoon Seo...

371
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:27,268
and Kim Jun Hee received the same number of votes,

372
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:31,509
hold the 2nd round of voting for the 2 for 5 minutes.

373
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:36,008
Only those who didn't vote for either of them in the first round...

374
00:26:36,009 --> 00:26:37,979
will vote again.

375
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:42,420
If they're tied again, everyone will be executed.

376
00:26:42,589 --> 00:26:44,120
They're going to kill us too?

377
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:51,430
I knew it. Let's just vote for that scumbag and end this.

378
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,298
Only the five of us should vote, right?

379
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:56,528
Me, Yeon Woo, Mi Na, So Mi,

380
00:26:56,529 --> 00:26:57,598
and who else is it?

381
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:00,170
The class president. He voted for Jung Won earlier.

382
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:03,038
It means Yoon Seo received one less vote already.

383
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,980
One minute has passed already.

384
00:27:07,749 --> 00:27:10,210
What do we do? Who should we vote for?

385
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:18,159
(Vote)

386
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,460
(Will you vote for Lee Yoon Seo?)

387
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,858
- Hey, Kim So Mi. - Kim So Mi...

388
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:26,900
voted for Lee Yoon Seo.

389
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:35,839
It was strange when she talked about the ghost and dragged us into this.

390
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:38,940
We were going to vote for Yoon Seo. Hurry up!

391
00:27:41,579 --> 00:27:43,109
This is not right.

392
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:46,380
Don't vote for her.

393
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,348
Seriously...

394
00:27:48,349 --> 00:27:50,519
Just freaking vote for anyone!

395
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,529
Hey.

396
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,299
Are you okay now?

397
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,940
You quit swimming because you couldn't enter water anymore.

398
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,470
I'm fine. I'm all good now.

399
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,329
I said I was a Citizen.

400
00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:34,799
It's all because of me.

401
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,599
I'll take the responsibility.

402
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,870
It's me.

403
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:45,180
I'm Mafia.

404
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:50,049
So vote for me.

405
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:51,349
Hey.

406
00:28:52,749 --> 00:28:53,919
Why are you saying that?

407
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,289
Are you crazy?

408
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,190
I told you to hand in your phones so that you can't vote.

409
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,200
I was the one who deleted the security camera footage.

410
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:05,700
No.

411
00:29:08,499 --> 00:29:09,630
I'm sorry.

412
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,069
I did it because I wanted to survive.

413
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,940
No.

414
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:17,210
But killing people...

415
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,880
I can't do it anymore.

416
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,220
I knew it when he was running around with an ax.

417
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:26,879
Just vote for that jerk and end this!

418
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,950
Wait.

419
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:32,120
Hey. It's not you.

420
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,630
Why are you doing this? It's not you.

421
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:41,370
Hey. It's not you.

422
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,869
- Why are you doing this? - Choi Mi Na...

423
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:47,199
- Hey. Don't. It's not him. - voted for Kim Jun Hee.

424
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,440
Don't do it.

425
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,640
Hey. It's not you.

426
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,449
- It's really not you. - Im Eun Chan...

427
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:57,519
voted for Kim Jun Hee.

428
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:00,449
We should go.

429
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:02,389
- Jun Hee, it's not you. - Nam Yeon Woo...

430
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:04,219
- voted for Kim Jun Hee. - Please.

431
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,619
- Let's go. - Don't do it.

432
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,990
Don't!

433
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,829
- Let's hurry up and go. - Jun Hee.

434
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:11,099
Just a second.

435
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,459
Yoon Seo.

436
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,328
Jun Hee. No!

437
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:18,299
Kim Jun Hee got the most votes and he will be executed.

438
00:30:25,109 --> 00:30:26,410
No.

439
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:27,980
Jun Hee.

440
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,339
Let go of me.

441
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,539
No.

442
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,049
No.

443
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,769
Please.
