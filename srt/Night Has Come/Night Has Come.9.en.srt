00:00:09,228 --> 00:00:12,638
(Lee Jae In, Kim Woo Seok, Choi Ye Bin)

2
00:00:13,368 --> 00:00:16,667
(Cha Woo Min, An Ji Ho, Jung So Ri)

3
00:00:17,568 --> 00:00:20,838
(Scriptwriter: Kang Min Ji)

4
00:00:21,638 --> 00:00:24,977
(Director: Im Dae Woong)

5
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:31,447
(Night Has Come)

6
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,317
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

7
00:00:33,318 --> 00:00:34,717
(in this drama are fictitious.)

8
00:00:36,257 --> 00:00:38,388
Ju Won. Let me give this a shot.

9
00:00:39,297 --> 00:00:40,297
Stand right there.

10
00:00:40,298 --> 00:00:41,327
Here it goes.

11
00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:45,498
(Jin Da Bum)

12
00:00:53,007 --> 00:00:54,808
(Jin Da Bum, your identity is the Mafia.)

13
00:01:22,407 --> 00:01:24,168
Darn it. Die!

14
00:01:25,267 --> 00:01:26,278
Die!

15
00:02:31,008 --> 00:02:32,038
Let's kill him.

16
00:02:33,978 --> 00:02:35,077
Are you sure?

17
00:02:36,807 --> 00:02:40,047
If he dies too, they might be onto you.

18
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:42,077
So say that we don't.

19
00:02:42,948 --> 00:02:44,617
Do you think he won't come after us?

20
00:02:48,587 --> 00:02:50,027
Besides, this jerk...

21
00:02:51,557 --> 00:02:52,927
knows that I'm the Mafia.

22
00:02:53,658 --> 00:02:54,658
What?

23
00:02:57,527 --> 00:02:59,598
So everyone agrees that we kill Ko Kyung Jun, right?

24
00:03:04,638 --> 00:03:06,177
We just need to catch the Police now.

25
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:09,077
It'll be over soon.

26
00:04:45,908 --> 00:04:46,978
Are you okay?

27
00:04:47,778 --> 00:04:48,807
Yes.

28
00:04:49,377 --> 00:04:54,047
During the night, Ko Kyung Jun was executed by the Mafia.

29
00:04:54,078 --> 00:04:57,387
Ko Kyung Jun was a Citizen.

30
00:04:58,148 --> 00:05:03,358
All participants, identify the Mafia and begin to vote.

31
00:05:13,297 --> 00:05:15,197
They were at each other's throats yesterday.

32
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:17,908
Yet, they both died on the same day.

33
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:20,038
Exactly.

34
00:05:20,978 --> 00:05:22,547
I know that the Mafia had to execute someone.

35
00:05:23,877 --> 00:05:25,578
But did they have to be this cruel?

36
00:05:26,817 --> 00:05:28,848
(Jin Da Bum)

37
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:30,518
We should...

38
00:05:31,218 --> 00:05:32,487
move the guys first.

39
00:05:33,057 --> 00:05:34,088
No.

40
00:05:34,687 --> 00:05:35,828
I won't do it.

41
00:05:36,228 --> 00:05:37,458
If you want to do it, you do it.

42
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:39,728
Hey, where are you going?

43
00:05:41,427 --> 00:05:42,427
Let's go.

44
00:05:42,997 --> 00:05:44,567
We were supposed to stay together until the vote.

45
00:05:46,268 --> 00:05:48,137
We can reassemble at night.

46
00:05:50,908 --> 00:05:52,167
We don't even know which one of us are Mafia.

47
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:53,578
Staying together sounds riskier.

48
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:54,937
Come on.

49
00:06:19,497 --> 00:06:21,598
We must identify the Mafia today.

50
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:25,437
If another Citizen dies, we'll be doomed.

51
00:06:28,338 --> 00:06:29,408
Who could it be?

52
00:06:41,718 --> 00:06:43,028
I thought about it.

53
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,658
Then I realized something weird.

54
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:52,328
Kyung Jun and Jin Ha...

55
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:55,838
They both died on the day Yoon Seo suspected them.

56
00:06:58,437 --> 00:06:59,478
What?

57
00:07:01,078 --> 00:07:02,538
Are you saying Yoon Seo is the Mafia?

58
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,877
Well, I might be wrong.

59
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:10,317
But it's odd that she's always hurrying to move the bodies.

60
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:13,658
I just thought that was weird.

61
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:19,358
It'd be nice if the Police would step up at times like this.

62
00:07:34,677 --> 00:07:36,608
Who are you going to vote out?

63
00:07:38,778 --> 00:07:40,778
I told you Yoon Seo seemed off from the get-go.

64
00:07:41,947 --> 00:07:44,917
Think about the security cameras and the ghost she rambled about.

65
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:47,887
I think she's trying to distract us from playing the game on purpose.

66
00:07:49,528 --> 00:07:50,528
But...

67
00:07:50,858 --> 00:07:53,257
Yoon Seo didn't seem like the type to lie.

68
00:07:54,658 --> 00:07:56,168
How could you possibly know that?

69
00:07:57,627 --> 00:07:59,797
Kyung Jun also said she was the Mafia.

70
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:02,397
Besides, he was right about Woo Ram.

71
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,668
So naturally, Kyung Jun must be right again.

72
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:05,768
Don't you agree?

73
00:08:08,737 --> 00:08:09,778
Mi Na.

74
00:08:10,507 --> 00:08:12,608
- What? - Don't you agree?

75
00:08:14,047 --> 00:08:15,278
I don't know.

76
00:08:18,487 --> 00:08:19,887
Can we talk?

77
00:08:21,117 --> 00:08:22,187
Talk about what?

78
00:08:24,527 --> 00:08:25,688
Come out for a second.

79
00:08:31,867 --> 00:08:33,437
(Ahn Na Hee, Lee Yoon Seo, Oh Jung Won, Jin Da Bum,)

80
00:08:33,438 --> 00:08:35,068
(Kim Jun Hee, Choi Mi Na, Kim So Mi, Nam Yeon Woo, Im Eun Chan)

81
00:08:35,397 --> 00:08:36,708
There are only nine of us left.

82
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,068
We must identify the Mafia tonight by all means.

83
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:42,808
What should we do?

84
00:08:43,507 --> 00:08:45,348
Even if we were to make it through the night,

85
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:48,978
someone would end up dead by tomorrow anyway.

86
00:08:52,887 --> 00:08:54,657
If this is truly the mission of this game,

87
00:08:55,688 --> 00:08:58,287
we might be able to get out of here as long as we find the host.

88
00:08:58,987 --> 00:09:00,298
Let's find the host first.

89
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,428
We must do whatever we can.

90
00:09:03,598 --> 00:09:04,598
Yes.

91
00:09:04,867 --> 00:09:06,497
But if we can't find the host before the sun goes down,

92
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:07,997
we must try to identify the Mafia.

93
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:11,938
We can't afford to vote out another Citizen.

94
00:09:13,938 --> 00:09:14,978
Yes.

95
00:09:15,578 --> 00:09:18,048
If we don't identify the Mafia, we'll be in danger too.

96
00:09:20,218 --> 00:09:21,218
Okay.

97
00:09:22,818 --> 00:09:25,616
There might be another clue other than the picture.

98
00:09:25,617 --> 00:09:27,088
- Right. - Let's search this room first.

99
00:09:35,198 --> 00:09:36,367
What is it?

100
00:09:38,468 --> 00:09:41,237
I think Jin Da Bum is the Mafia.

101
00:09:44,808 --> 00:09:46,608
- Jin Da Bum? - Yes.

102
00:09:47,178 --> 00:09:48,208
Why?

103
00:09:49,877 --> 00:09:51,276
Only the three of us know...

104
00:09:51,277 --> 00:09:52,647
that we locked Kyung Jun up in the storage room.

105
00:09:53,318 --> 00:09:54,646
To be honest, among the three of us,

106
00:09:54,647 --> 00:09:57,147
he's the only one who must want to get revenge on Kyung Jun.

107
00:10:01,387 --> 00:10:03,527
But it was us who wanted to steal the keys first.

108
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,897
What if he tells the others and we end up being suspected?

109
00:10:07,558 --> 00:10:08,698
What will you do then?

110
00:10:09,228 --> 00:10:11,328
I'm serious. There's something off about his gaze.

111
00:10:12,068 --> 00:10:15,237
It's creepy. It's the same gaze I saw from Woo Ram.

112
00:10:22,637 --> 00:10:23,747
What's going on?

113
00:10:24,808 --> 00:10:26,007
What are you doing here?

114
00:10:27,718 --> 00:10:28,747
What?

115
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:33,657
Aren't those Ko Kyung Jun's keys?

116
00:10:36,987 --> 00:10:38,328
Yes. So...

117
00:10:41,157 --> 00:10:43,527
I saw him hiding them behind the indoor fire hydrant.

118
00:10:44,598 --> 00:10:45,627
What?

119
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:47,897
How come you didn't tell us that?

120
00:10:48,938 --> 00:10:49,938
What?

121
00:10:52,037 --> 00:10:53,137
No way.

122
00:10:54,938 --> 00:10:56,007
You guys...

123
00:10:57,348 --> 00:10:59,208
wanted all the food to yourselves, didn't you?

124
00:11:00,848 --> 00:11:02,617
You guys are unbelievable.

125
00:11:04,088 --> 00:11:05,948
Hey, not everyone is a glutton like you.

126
00:11:07,757 --> 00:11:09,417
Kyung Jun is dead.

127
00:11:10,188 --> 00:11:11,387
We were hungry.

128
00:11:12,627 --> 00:11:14,497
We didn't tell anyone because we were scared too.

129
00:11:19,537 --> 00:11:20,598
Yeon Woo.

130
00:11:21,338 --> 00:11:22,438
Aren't you hungry?

131
00:11:24,468 --> 00:11:25,737
I'm not hungry.

132
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:43,987
Yoon Seo, can we open this up with that key you found?

133
00:11:58,708 --> 00:11:59,838
This isn't it.

134
00:12:00,308 --> 00:12:01,308
What?

135
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:02,737
Wait.

136
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:07,478
It won't open.

137
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,917
Let's open this up just in case.

138
00:12:12,247 --> 00:12:13,358
We can just break it.

139
00:12:13,588 --> 00:12:15,958
Yes. There must be tools in the storage room. We'll get them.

140
00:12:43,948 --> 00:12:45,348
You'll get it back at voting time.

141
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:51,987
This is our class.

142
00:14:00,627 --> 00:14:03,928
(Check the name of the game host.)

143
00:14:07,568 --> 00:14:08,767
(Park Se Eun)

144
00:14:12,637 --> 00:14:13,708
"Park Se Eun?"

145
00:14:19,448 --> 00:14:21,178
(Swimming Pool Cafeteria)

146
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:34,897
(Oh Jung Won)

147
00:14:37,027 --> 00:14:38,027
(Check the name of the game host.)

148
00:14:43,037 --> 00:14:44,037
(Park Se Eun)

149
00:14:46,438 --> 00:14:47,478
Park Se Eun?

150
00:14:47,978 --> 00:14:49,037
"Park Se Eun?"

151
00:14:58,348 --> 00:14:59,448
Hey, Park Se Eun!

152
00:15:07,358 --> 00:15:10,367
(Park Se Eun)

153
00:15:13,737 --> 00:15:14,838
"Park Se Eun?"

154
00:15:15,137 --> 00:15:16,267
The girl who committed suicide?

155
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:22,478
What's this?

156
00:15:23,277 --> 00:15:24,507
Is this real?

157
00:15:29,848 --> 00:15:31,588
Se Eun was the host.

158
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,157
But she's dead.

159
00:15:37,387 --> 00:15:38,428
How?

160
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:40,897
Yes.

161
00:15:41,657 --> 00:15:43,298
How can a dead girl be the host?

162
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:45,897
I bet it's all because of the game too.

163
00:15:46,598 --> 00:15:49,437
Anyway, thanks to Yoon Seo who figured out the host,

164
00:15:49,438 --> 00:15:50,468
our memories came back too.

165
00:15:51,007 --> 00:15:52,068
But still.

166
00:15:52,838 --> 00:15:56,078
How could our memories disappear and come back?

167
00:15:59,818 --> 00:16:01,078
This is crazy.

168
00:16:02,277 --> 00:16:03,318
Wait.

169
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:07,358
Yoon Seo, you said you had seen a ghost before.

170
00:16:07,987 --> 00:16:09,157
Was it Park Se Eun?

171
00:16:10,358 --> 00:16:11,487
(Im Eun Chan)

172
00:16:11,627 --> 00:16:12,787
Whatever.

173
00:16:12,987 --> 00:16:15,757
So this is happening because of Park Se Eun, right?

174
00:16:16,428 --> 00:16:17,428
Hey.

175
00:16:19,497 --> 00:16:21,137
You were the one who found the picture.

176
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:23,637
Is it possible that you know more,

177
00:16:24,468 --> 00:16:25,938
but you're not telling us?

178
00:16:28,108 --> 00:16:30,178
You and Park Se Eun were close!

179
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,477
We were just her classmates. We had nothing to do with her.

180
00:16:32,478 --> 00:16:34,277
Why are we playing this game?

181
00:16:38,147 --> 00:16:39,147
Come on.

182
00:16:40,657 --> 00:16:41,657
Yes.

183
00:16:42,688 --> 00:16:44,728
I've barely talked to her.

184
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,198
- Me too. - What's wrong with Park Se Eun?

185
00:16:47,828 --> 00:16:50,867
Why is she trying to kill us after committing suicide?

186
00:16:56,907 --> 00:16:58,437
Park Se Eun didn't commit suicide.

187
00:17:00,677 --> 00:17:02,508
The rumor says she was killed.

188
00:17:06,617 --> 00:17:08,377
Someone killed her?

189
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:16,558
I heard that too.

190
00:17:16,788 --> 00:17:18,288
I heard someone pushed her.

191
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,957
Isn't that just a rumor?

192
00:17:22,358 --> 00:17:23,367
Yes.

193
00:17:23,998 --> 00:17:25,697
The police said she committed suicide.

194
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:29,866
What does that have to do with this?

195
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:31,338
Mafia Game is what we have to worry about.

196
00:17:32,137 --> 00:17:33,207
Wait.

197
00:17:34,477 --> 00:17:38,048
Why did Se Eun start this game?

198
00:17:39,447 --> 00:17:40,548
If...

199
00:17:42,078 --> 00:17:44,488
she didn't commit suicide like the rumor says,

200
00:17:47,687 --> 00:17:50,558
and she was trying to tell us that she died because of one of us...

201
00:17:51,328 --> 00:17:52,358
Are you saying...

202
00:17:53,328 --> 00:17:56,358
that one of us killed her?

203
00:17:57,667 --> 00:17:58,798
One of us?

204
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:05,437
What are you looking at?

205
00:18:06,677 --> 00:18:07,738
How does that make sense?

206
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:11,548
What could it be?

207
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:12,947
Does it have something to do with the Mafia?

208
00:18:14,248 --> 00:18:15,278
Hey.

209
00:18:15,977 --> 00:18:17,217
Who were the Mafias?

210
00:18:19,617 --> 00:18:20,617
Woo Ram.

211
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,917
Ju Won. Ye Won.

212
00:18:23,758 --> 00:18:24,828
The rest are unknown.

213
00:18:28,227 --> 00:18:31,197
Hey, Park Woo Ram killed Ju Young.

214
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:33,127
He said he wanted to kill him...

215
00:18:33,128 --> 00:18:34,798
because Ju Young always disregarded him.

216
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:36,907
Did he...

217
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,207
kill Park Se Eun too?

218
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:43,977
Between the two,

219
00:18:44,947 --> 00:18:46,078
did anything happen?

220
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:47,977
Do you know anything?

221
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:52,187
We wouldn't know.

222
00:18:52,788 --> 00:18:54,818
Park Woo Ram wasn't committed.

223
00:18:55,187 --> 00:18:58,028
Maybe he flirted at Park Se Eun too.

224
00:18:58,988 --> 00:19:00,028
Then...

225
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:03,157
did all this happen because of Park Woo Ram?

226
00:19:04,098 --> 00:19:05,098
But...

227
00:19:07,098 --> 00:19:09,268
if Woo Ram killed Se Eun,

228
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:12,167
what about the other Mafias?

229
00:19:14,207 --> 00:19:15,338
What did they do?

230
00:19:23,447 --> 00:19:24,447
What?

231
00:19:25,088 --> 00:19:26,187
What do you want to say?

232
00:19:27,217 --> 00:19:28,217
About Se Eun.

233
00:19:29,657 --> 00:19:31,627
She died because of us, didn't she?

234
00:19:31,887 --> 00:19:32,927
Are you crazy?

235
00:19:33,528 --> 00:19:35,157
Why would you bring that up now?

236
00:19:36,028 --> 00:19:38,367
She wouldn't have died unless that happened.

237
00:19:40,068 --> 00:19:41,597
We should tell everyone...

238
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:43,707
and beg Se Eun for forgiveness.

239
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:46,308
Then she might save us.

240
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:50,108
Tell everyone about what?

241
00:19:51,877 --> 00:19:54,877
It was just a joke. It wasn't a big deal.

242
00:19:56,248 --> 00:19:57,788
We did nothing wrong. Why...

243
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:01,358
would we beg for forgiveness?

244
00:20:02,818 --> 00:20:04,656
So Mi, let's just confess.

245
00:20:04,657 --> 00:20:06,187
I'm scared.

246
00:20:06,528 --> 00:20:07,558
Please...

247
00:20:10,768 --> 00:20:14,397
keep your mouth closed, will you?

248
00:20:19,238 --> 00:20:22,278
If you tell everyone, they'll all vote us out.

249
00:20:23,308 --> 00:20:25,447
We'll die today even before we get to apologize.

250
00:20:31,848 --> 00:20:33,088
So,

251
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:37,858
don't say anything stupid and get a grip.

252
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:39,588
Okay.

253
00:20:55,008 --> 00:20:56,078
Na Hee.

254
00:20:59,477 --> 00:21:00,778
Wipe your tears before you go in.

255
00:21:14,098 --> 00:21:15,197
What are you doing?

256
00:21:15,697 --> 00:21:16,897
What if someone sees us?

257
00:21:17,227 --> 00:21:18,697
Ahn Na Hee's going to cause trouble.

258
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:20,167
What do we do?

259
00:21:20,937 --> 00:21:22,798
- What trouble? - About Park Se Eun!

260
00:21:24,238 --> 00:21:25,838
She's going to tell everyone about what happened.

261
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:28,377
What if other kids find out?

262
00:21:30,078 --> 00:21:31,147
So what?

263
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:33,748
Hey.

264
00:21:35,778 --> 00:21:37,518
You shouldn't have crossed the line.

265
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:40,687
Why did you have to bully her so much?

266
00:21:41,318 --> 00:21:43,187
- Hey! - Ahn Na Hee!

267
00:21:46,528 --> 00:21:47,998
You're in charge of that wench.

268
00:21:50,627 --> 00:21:52,498
So you should've paid attention to her.

269
00:21:53,538 --> 00:21:55,838
You neglected her for too long while hanging out with Choi Mi Na.

270
00:21:57,637 --> 00:21:59,667
You're the one who threatened her.

271
00:22:01,078 --> 00:22:02,838
Now you make it sound like it's none of your business?

272
00:22:07,477 --> 00:22:09,177
Who else knows other than you?

273
00:22:16,318 --> 00:22:18,427
Too bad I already killed everyone who knows.

274
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,068
It has nothing to do with me now.

275
00:22:29,768 --> 00:22:31,937
Do you really want to die, loser?

276
00:22:49,957 --> 00:22:51,727
If she talks about Park Se Eun,

277
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:55,598
we can't protect you anymore.

278
00:23:04,238 --> 00:23:05,268
Better take care of it.

279
00:23:13,578 --> 00:23:14,917
Dang it.

280
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:26,058
This is Kyung Jun's.

281
00:23:26,957 --> 00:23:28,197
I found it here.

282
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:29,998
I thought you needed to see it too.

283
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,667
What was that doing here?

284
00:23:32,598 --> 00:23:34,197
I went to see Jin Ha,

285
00:23:36,137 --> 00:23:38,068
and Da Bum went to give the phone to Kyung Jun.

286
00:23:50,617 --> 00:23:52,447
I think the door was slammed with a chair.

287
00:23:54,217 --> 00:23:55,417
It wasn't like this yesterday.

288
00:23:56,788 --> 00:23:57,828
No.

289
00:24:02,758 --> 00:24:04,068
Was it Ko Kyung Jun?

290
00:24:06,068 --> 00:24:07,197
Something's strange.

291
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,167
Jin Ha and Kyung Jun suspected each other of killing Seung Bin,

292
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:14,137
and they both ended up dying.

293
00:24:16,508 --> 00:24:17,548
What if...

294
00:24:18,778 --> 00:24:21,177
the Mafia planned to kill both from the start?

295
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,488
We fell for it too.

296
00:24:26,887 --> 00:24:28,318
Dang it.

297
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:38,768
What took you so long!

298
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:42,167
I was petrified to see a ghost.

299
00:24:44,238 --> 00:24:45,308
Hey.

300
00:24:45,608 --> 00:24:47,976
Park Se Eun is forcing us to play a game after becoming a ghost.

301
00:24:47,977 --> 00:24:49,137
Aren't you scared?

302
00:24:52,308 --> 00:24:54,446
Stop talking about a ghost!

303
00:24:54,447 --> 00:24:56,348
Why are you yelling?

304
00:24:57,588 --> 00:24:58,617
Hey.

305
00:24:58,917 --> 00:25:01,156
We don't even know what's going to happen after voting tonight.

306
00:25:01,157 --> 00:25:02,617
Who cares about the ghost?

307
00:25:10,528 --> 00:25:11,897
What now?

308
00:25:15,137 --> 00:25:16,897
Who are you going to vote out?

309
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:28,177
After listening to you, I thought about it.

310
00:25:30,788 --> 00:25:31,788
And Jin Da Bum...

311
00:25:33,387 --> 00:25:34,687
looks suspicious.

312
00:25:37,588 --> 00:25:39,927
On top of Kyung Jun and the other kids being dead,

313
00:25:40,058 --> 00:25:42,558
even when Park Se Eun treated him like he was invisible,

314
00:25:43,058 --> 00:25:44,896
do you remember how he kept talking to her?

315
00:25:44,897 --> 00:25:47,238
- Stop it. - Wait.

316
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:48,697
Right.

317
00:25:49,437 --> 00:25:52,167
So other kids thought he had a crush on her.

318
00:25:55,738 --> 00:25:57,348
Then what?

319
00:25:58,308 --> 00:25:59,548
Vote Jin Da Bum out?

320
00:26:03,318 --> 00:26:04,318
No.

321
00:26:06,018 --> 00:26:07,457
If we vote him out now,

322
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:10,358
other kids will suspect us because of the keys.

323
00:26:10,858 --> 00:26:12,088
What do you want to do then?

324
00:26:17,268 --> 00:26:18,298
There is...

325
00:26:20,738 --> 00:26:23,268
one more suspicious person apart from him.

326
00:26:25,068 --> 00:26:26,068
Who?

327
00:26:47,927 --> 00:26:49,457
Did you go to the storage room...

328
00:26:50,058 --> 00:26:51,367
on the second floor last night?

329
00:26:55,098 --> 00:26:56,637
No. Why?

330
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:02,608
Kyung Jun's phone was there.

331
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:05,947
You were the last person who saw Kyung Jun yesterday.

332
00:27:08,778 --> 00:27:10,048
We were wondering if you knew anything.

333
00:27:12,617 --> 00:27:14,687
No, I don't.

334
00:27:16,788 --> 00:27:19,028
I didn't go see Kyung Jun alone.

335
00:27:19,427 --> 00:27:21,427
So Mi and Mi Na came along too.

336
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:28,038
Yes?

337
00:27:28,467 --> 00:27:31,068
Did you see where Ko Kyung Jun went last night?

338
00:27:36,308 --> 00:27:37,748
I knew it.

339
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:39,446
Hey.

340
00:27:39,447 --> 00:27:41,477
You were lying when you said you found the keys, weren't you?

341
00:27:42,048 --> 00:27:44,088
Aren't those Ko Kyung Jun's keys?

342
00:27:44,187 --> 00:27:45,717
Yes. So...

343
00:27:48,518 --> 00:27:51,028
No, it's true.

344
00:27:51,828 --> 00:27:53,157
What keys?

345
00:27:53,457 --> 00:27:55,157
They have Kyung Jun's keys.

346
00:27:55,457 --> 00:27:56,697
I saw them in the cafeteria earlier.

347
00:27:57,298 --> 00:27:58,697
It's a misunderstanding.

348
00:28:00,127 --> 00:28:01,538
I already explained everything yesterday.

349
00:28:01,697 --> 00:28:03,568
Tell us what happened.

350
00:28:04,838 --> 00:28:06,667
Kyung Jun wouldn't have given you the keys for no reason.

351
00:28:13,707 --> 00:28:16,748
I saw him hiding them behind the indoor fire hydrant. That's all.

352
00:28:16,947 --> 00:28:17,947
Hey.

353
00:28:18,647 --> 00:28:21,417
You didn't get along with Se Eun.

354
00:28:22,318 --> 00:28:23,387
What do you mean?

355
00:28:23,657 --> 00:28:26,088
You never talked to Se Eun, and you always ignored her.

356
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:27,957
When did we?

357
00:28:31,998 --> 00:28:33,768
I never did that.

358
00:28:35,437 --> 00:28:37,207
Stop lying.

359
00:28:37,937 --> 00:28:39,937
You always gossiped about her with other girls.

360
00:28:40,068 --> 00:28:41,407
Eun Ha told me.

361
00:28:42,108 --> 00:28:44,078
What kind of nonsense is that?

362
00:28:44,248 --> 00:28:45,977
The more I think about it, the stranger it is.

363
00:28:48,048 --> 00:28:49,078
Are you...

364
00:28:50,318 --> 00:28:51,387
the Mafias?

365
00:29:04,568 --> 00:29:05,568
Wait.

366
00:29:08,197 --> 00:29:09,298
To be honest,

367
00:29:10,907 --> 00:29:11,937
I know...

368
00:29:13,508 --> 00:29:16,207
who started the rumor about Se Eun's video.

369
00:29:17,008 --> 00:29:18,048
What?

370
00:29:30,588 --> 00:29:32,226
Kim So Mi voted...

371
00:29:32,227 --> 00:29:35,098
for Ahn Na Hee.

372

Choi Mi Na...

(Voting announcement)

375
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,697
What are you doing?

376
00:29:44,568 --> 00:29:45,608
She said...

377
00:29:45,937 --> 00:29:48,637
Woo Ram showed her the video.

378
00:29:51,348 --> 00:29:53,477
I should've stopped them.

379
00:29:55,677 --> 00:29:57,348
She's the one who spread the rumor.

380
00:30:01,818 --> 00:30:02,916
Na Hee, did you?

381
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:05,157
Hey, is there really a video?

382
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:07,598
Yes.

383
00:30:08,258 --> 00:30:11,467
Ahn Na Hee spread the rumor and the video.

384
00:30:11,568 --> 00:30:12,867
When did I?

385
00:30:13,697 --> 00:30:15,838
You created the video.

386
00:30:16,598 --> 00:30:18,637
You hated Se Eun because of Jun Hee.

387
00:30:19,407 --> 00:30:22,206
You started the rumor. Why are you framing me?

388
00:30:22,207 --> 00:30:23,677
Stop it for goodness' sake!

389
00:30:26,207 --> 00:30:27,417
Do we all have to die...

390
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:29,717
because of you?

391
00:30:40,157 --> 00:30:41,427
It wasn't me.

392
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:56,778
I'm the Mafia?

393
00:31:00,477 --> 00:31:01,477
Are you...

394
00:31:06,848 --> 00:31:08,687
going to take responsibility for what you said?

395
00:31:09,988 --> 00:31:11,427
You're the one who needs to take responsibility.

396
00:31:13,157 --> 00:31:14,157
Sure.

397
00:31:14,897 --> 00:31:17,328
We'd know who's telling the truth if we checked.

398
00:31:22,467 --> 00:31:24,367
Can I check your identity now?

399
00:31:29,238 --> 00:31:30,437
How are you going to check that?

400
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:33,447
I'll show you.

401
00:31:35,778 --> 00:31:36,877
I'm the Police.

402
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:42,957
What are you talking about?

403
00:31:46,227 --> 00:31:47,397
Stop lying!

405
