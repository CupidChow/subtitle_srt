1
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,600
   

3
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,750
   

4
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,640
   

5
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,910
   

6
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,410
   

7
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,650
   

8
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,430
Lee Yun Seo!

9
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,670
Are you okay? Answer me.

10
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,240
What if something happened?

11
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,680
Why don't we bring the rest over?

12
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,030
Let me try to go in.

13
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,370
If you don't hear from me in five minutes, call them over.

14
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,940
Okay.

15
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,040
Lee Yun Seo!

16
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,740
Where are you?

17
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,530
Answer me, please.

18
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,170
 I'm on the second floor right now. Something's wrong.
   

19
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,590
 Come quickly. 

20
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,770
   

21
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,900
Lee Yun Seo.

22
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,460
    
    

23
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,270
Since there are six people,

24
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,270
it would be over if we only voted for two more people.

25
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,150
Hey, what do we do?

26
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,290
What do you mean?

27
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,350
We must prove that Park Wu Ram, that son of a bitch, is Mafia.

28
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,620
Let's go.

29
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,190
But I'm glad,

30
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,740
you two are the ones left.

31
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,520
- Hurry. 
 - Okay. I'll do it right now.

32
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,930
I don't want to.

33
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,790
Don't force us.

34
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,190
What?

35
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,260
Ji Su.

36
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm definitely not forcing you.

37
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,810
- We are in a bad situation. 
 -Think from our perspective.

38
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,690
Now it's either you or Go Gyeong Jun.

39
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:00,390
When you pressure us like this, we can't even think straight.

40
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,630
Don't be like that.

41
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,530
Do you…

42
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,430
happen to think I'm the mafia?

43
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,030
I wouldn't know.

44
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,990
Could you leave so we can think alone?

45
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,130
Fuck!

46
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,100
Hey, Wu Ram!

47
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,000
Wu Ram.

48
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,500
How could they do this to me? Huh?

49
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,190
Fuck! Seriously.

50
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,620
Ji Su must be the one doing this because it's all too sudden.

51
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,020
Let me try to talk to her.

52
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,480
So wait in the room, okay?

53
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,700
Hello? Hello?

54
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,330
 This is from our school. 

55
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,130
   

56
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,740
Why?

57
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,170
Hey, Choi Mi Na.

58
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,400
Where's that Park Wu Ram bastard?

59
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,060
He's on the fourth floor.

60
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,010
Hold on.

61
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,610
Is he with the rest of the group?

62
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,240
No, they're talking on the third floor.

63
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,580
You were in the same boat as us.

64
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,120
Let's all row.

65
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,110
What are you talking about?

66
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,750
Bring that Mafia bastard.

67
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,740
Okay?

68
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,440
Ji Su, think about it some more.

69
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,270
Yu Jun.

70
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,300
Why don't you vote for Go Gyeong Jun first?

71
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,110
Okay, got it.

72
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,180
I told you not to force us.

73
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,070
We need some time to think this through.

74
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,100
What is the point of even thinking?

75
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,310
- It's none other than Wu Ram. 
 - What about him?

76
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,210
He always spoke badly of Ju Yeong.

77
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,710
That's a separate issue.

78
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:09,800
Wu Ram is our friend, right?

79
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,950
Yes, Ji Su. Let's support him.

80
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,180
Cha Yu Jun. Get it together.

81
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:18,680
We have to find the mafia to go home! Seriously.

82
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,050
I don't trust anyone, whether they're friends or not.

83
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:26,090
And we don't know if she pushed Dong Hyeon or not.

84
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,840
Hey, what did you just say?

85
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,870
That's enough.

86
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,500
We shouldn't be fighting each other right now.

87
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,940
Park Ji Su is not who I thought she was.

88
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,690
She's just trying to save herself.

89
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,890
And Yu Jun is also a pushover.

90
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,290
Wu Ram.

91
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,270
Park Wu Ram!

92
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,220
Isn't he here?

93
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,750
Where is Wu Ram?

94
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,140
I told him to stay in the room.

95
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,420
Let's look for him.

96
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,890
Is Yu Jun by himself?

97
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:37,040
Y-Yes. He wanted to talk to you alone about voting without Ji Su.

98
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,330
Hey, Cha Yu Jun—

99
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,980
Shit. Move him.

100
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,130
Buy some more time. I'll show you how you can catch the mafia.

101
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,450
 Fuck. 

102
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,910
 Shit. 

103
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,990
 Put him away quickly. 

104
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,360
Shit...

105
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,540
Wu Ram.

106
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,630
- Park Wu Ram! 
 - Park Wu Ram!

107
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,240
Hey, Wu Ram.

108
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,940
He's not here, either.

109
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,090
This is not good. Let's split up.

110
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,500
Okay.

111
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,420
Park Wu Ram!

112
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,290
Hey, Wu Ram!

113
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,110
Speak up, you fucker.

114
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,180
Shit!

115
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,260
Speak up, I said!

116
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,470
P-Please don't… Please…

117
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:14,280
You fucker! How dare you try to kill me? You fuck!

118
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,990
Hey…

119
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,480
What?

120
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,370
I think he passed out.

121
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,950
Hey. Hey.

122
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,010
He may be pretending.

123
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:04,040
Ji Su, it's past 11 o`clock. Aren't you going to vote?

124
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:08,470
Let's just vote for Go Gyeong Jun.

125
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,470
H-Hey, hold on.

126
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:16,640
You said that you needed time to think. Why the sudden rush?

127
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,130
All you have to do is vote before midnight.

128
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,600
Think about it some more.

129
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,880
Park Wu Ram!

130
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,930
Hey, Wu Ram.

131
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,620
Park Wu Ram!

132
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,730
Jeong Won.

133
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,210
Wh-Where's Yun Seo?

134
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,850
I don't know. I didn't see her.

135
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,300
I went as far as I could, but it was blocked off.

136
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,330
- "It was blocked off"? 
 - Yes.

137
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,880
I think we need to look outside.

138
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,490
Okay.

139
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,150
Jeong Won. Oh Jeong Won!

140
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,850
What?

141
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,420
Yun Seo.

142
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,420
Yun Seo, we were worried about you.

143
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,930
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

144
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,310
I fell into the basement,

145
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,410
and there was a room with CCTV.

146
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:05,430
When I got out, all of a sudden I was on the second floor.

147
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:11,100
I kept circling around, but I ended up in the same place.

148
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,890
I was barely able to get out of there.

149
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:17,360
If you fell into the basement, how could you be on the second floor?

150
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,060
And it was all…

151
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,660
blocked off in there.

152
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,040
I'm serious.

153
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,790
I found this, too.

154
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,690
Is this from our school?

155
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,640
I think they're our seniors,

156
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,720
but I'm not sure.

157
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,680
What happened to their faces?

158
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,660
How upsetting.

159
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,850
I think she's the ghost I saw.

160
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,280
What?

161
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,700
Yun Seo.

162
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,390
Did Wu Ram come here?

163
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,000
- No. 
 - He said he would be in the room.

164
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,340
He suddenly disappeared.

165
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:17,070
There's no time. You'd better tell us.

166
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,890
There's no time! You fucker!

167
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,270
Look how stubborn he is.

168
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,620
He's the mafia. I'm telling you.

169
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,080
Grab him.

170
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,770
Grab him!

171
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,450
Don't do it.

172
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,080
Don't do it, you son of a bitch.

173
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,490
Don't do what? We haven't even started yet.

174
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,420
D-Don't do it, I said!

175
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:25,220
I really hate your eyes.

176
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,510
Should I take them out?

177
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,640
You should've just died quietly. How dare you provoke me?

178
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,750
Wu Ram.

179
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,510
Wu Ram!

180
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,240
Hey, Park Wu Ram!

181
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,450
Is he not on the second floor, either?

182
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,610
No.

183
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,890
He wasn't on the first floor or the basement, either.

184
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,800
Should we check the annex?

185
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,890
 This is Park Wu Ram. 

186
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,290
What?

187
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,910
I am Mafia.

188
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:26,320
 I killed Lee Ju Yeong. 

189
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,560
What's Wu Ram doing?

190
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,200
What's this?

191
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,020
- The broadcasting room. 
  - I… 

192
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,010
 didn't like her that much, 

193
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,200
but I got angry because she humiliated me.

194
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:45,540
 I wanted to freaking kill her because she always looked down on me. 

195
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,760
That lunatic.

196
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:55,190
- Park Wu Ram? 
 - What is he saying?

197
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,600
He said he is Mafia.

198
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,990
Are you happy?

199
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,500
Are you happy? You fucker!

200
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,080
Fucker. You should've talked sooner.

201
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,010
 Wu Ram! Park Wu Ram! 

202
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,150
 Hey! 

203
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,850
Hey! Open the door!

204
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,640
Hey! Open the door, I said!

205
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,070
G-Guys, I'm in here!

206
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,300
Hey! Hey!

207
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,640
Damn it!

208
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,630
Get out of the way.

209
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,150
Fuck! Kim Jun Hui!

210
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,270
You crazy bastards!

211
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:30,090
You're all crazy. You're crazy!

212
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,620
Are you okay?

213
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,840
Shit.

214
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,500
Fuck! I'm not the crazy one.

215
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,760
He's the mafia. He killed Lee Ju Yeong!

216
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,090
You freaking bastard.

217
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,780
Get it together, you idiot.

218
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,580
Look.

219
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,510
It's all over.

220
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,810
   

221
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,260
F***!

222
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,350
I should've killed that asshole Go Gyeong Jun first.

223
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,080
I was just a damn loser.

224
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,410
Fuck.

225
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,840
Hey, hey!

226
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,930
- Hey! 
 - Wu Ram. Hey, hey, hey!

227
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:02,750
You must come with me. You son of a bitch.

228
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,170
Hey, be careful.

229
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:07,660
- You crazy bastard! 
 - Try to stop him!

230
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:14,040
I'll fucking kill you before I die!

231
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:18,870
The other Mafia members will kill you, anyway.

232
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:22,180
You fucker. Die!

233
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:26,150
 The voting has ended. 

234
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:34,540
 Park Wu Ram, the one with the most votes, will be executed. 

235
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,510
 Park Woo Ram was the mafia. 

236
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,620
See? I told you.

237
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,080
- Run! 
 - Go!

238
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,620
Come on!

239
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,540
Help Yun Seo.

240
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:06,960


241
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:43,400
   

242
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:50,030
   

243
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,450
