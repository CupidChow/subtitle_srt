1
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,520
   

2
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,710
   

3
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,910
   

4
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,030
   

5
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,430
   

6
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,680
   

7
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,080
   

8
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,490
 Kim Dong Hyeon was a civilian. 

9
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:14,320


10
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,700
They're here.

11
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,110
What happened to Dong Hyeon?

12
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,150
H-Hey, say something.

13
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,470
Where is Dong Hyeon? What on earth happened?

14
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,600
He thought…

15
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,760
the white line had disappeared…

16
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,220
and he went to check on it...

17
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,200
but he slipped.

18
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,390
What about the village?

19
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,430
How far did you go?

20
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,460
You said you were going to find people and ask for help! Did you?

21
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,470
We can't go.

22
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,420
Everything is blocked by the lines.

23
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,910
We're completely trapped.

24
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,470
Then...

25
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,570
we are really…

26
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,840
trapped here until we finish this game?

27
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,950
Yes.

28
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,760
Are you crying?

29
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,760
If I hadn't

30
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,200
suggested…

31
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,520
that we go to the mountains...

32
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,600
they wouldn't have died.

33
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,600
If I had just kept quiet…

34
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,100
Dong Hyeon died because of me.

35
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,450
It's not like you forced anyone.

36
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,400
They volunteered.

37
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,900
No one knew there was no path.

38
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,550
No one knew. What could we have done?

39
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,240
So…

40
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,340
what will you do now?

41
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,500
We can't leave here until the game is over.

42
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,750
Are you going to stay like this?

43
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,970
No.

44
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,090
I will find another way.

45
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,590
Hello? Hello?

46
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,520
Hello? Hey. Hey!

47
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,610
Where are you going?

48
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,090
Gyeong Jun and the others called me.

49
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,650
If you don't want to go, then don't go.

50
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,050
I think I should go anyway.

51
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,870
Shit!

52
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:50,210
Damn it!

53
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,990
Hey, Kim Jun Hui!

54
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,950
What are you doing?

55
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,790
Isn't that a phone call?

56
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,730
What's wrong?

57
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,540
Hello?

58
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,940
Just leave it.

59
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,770
What's wrong?

60
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,280
It's all fake.

61
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,610
What?

62
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,560
The wire wasn't even connected.

63
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,770
What the heck?

64
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,850
   

65
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,300
Look at this.

66
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,310
It's empty.

67
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,390
You love sesame.

68
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,740
Yes, thank you.

69
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,910
The only thing we have in common is our love of ramen.

70
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,040
Then do you have a different kind of taste in music?

71
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,170
Fuck! Do you want to die?

72
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,410
How dare you force a pervert's music on me?

73
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,940
All right! I won't.

74
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,210
Hey, Otaku.

75
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,550
Games are your area of expertise.

76
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,500
Did this game exist before?

77
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,500
No, I've never seen it before, either.

78
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,760
And I'm not an Otaku.

79
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,230
All right, sorry about that.

80
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,870
Anyway, what do we need to do to win this game?

81
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,160
It's the same as the mafia game.

82
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,530
Have you never played it before?

83
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,190
Who doesn't know that, you fucker?

84
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:06,590
 You're the only one who knows if you're a civilian or a mafia until you die. 

85
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:10,080
 You need to find out who plays what role on the other team. 

86
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,490
 Doctors and Police Officers are on the same side as Civilians. 

87
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,830
 The team that kills the other team first wins. 

88
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,620
Fuck, when will we find all the mafia members?

89
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,880
Hey,

90
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,550
what if we just kill whoever we want?

91
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,510
Then the game will end.

92
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,480
You said you're also a civilian.

93
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,680
We only need to kill all the mafia. Why kill everyone?

94
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,840
It says to kill everyone, you fool.

95
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,120
Why would you kill your own team?

96
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,790
You can't even kill anyone. You're just bluffing.

97
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,260
You were scared to death when others died…

98
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,740
You fucker! When was I ever scared–

99
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,030
Shit! Shut up, would you?

100
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,290
Choi Ju Won!

101
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,990
Why did he die if he was the mafia?

102
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,350
I don't really know, either.

103
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:12,120
He says that the mafia has to kill someone.

104
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,980
There must have been a reason why Ju Won was killed instead of a civilian.

105
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,760
What happens when a civilian kills a member of the mafia?

106
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,420
Is that allowed?

107
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,660
It's not in the rules, so I don't know.

108
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:36,590
Let's just gather all the mafia members and tell them to kill their own teammates.

109
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,540
- Good idea. 
 - Isn't it? I'm a genius.

110
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,820
- That sounds good, doesn't it? 
 - It does.

111
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,000
Gosh, you morons.

112
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,360
What part of that sounds good to you?

113
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,130
Do you think this will work?

114
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:01,060
What if someone like Choi Ju Won dies today?

115
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,270
We will have to hide and lock the doors or something.

116
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,420
Are you going to vote?

117
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,400
We have to.

118
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,810
How many of us are Mafia?

119
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:22,080
I don't know. It doesn't say.

120
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,600
Oh, yes. The police officer!

121
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,830
The message this morning said that the police officer used his power. He should know!

122
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,240
Are you all really civilians?

123
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,600
Aren't there any police officers here?

124
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,730
Hold on! Things are getting hectic.

125
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,560
If we're really going to vote, let's call Jun Hui as well.

126
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,410
Go and get Jun Hui.

127
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:54,840
She should get him herself.

128
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,500
What about Na Hui?

129
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,370
Who knows? She's probably asleep in the infirmary.

130
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:07,130
Hey, Park Wu Ram! Get Na Hui, too!

131
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:18,760
When I got hurt,

132
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,680
I should have said it was painful and convinced them to come back.

133
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,820
This wouldn't have happened if we had returned immediately.

134
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,370
No.

135
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,550
Even if you asked them to come back,

136
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,240
they could've just kept going.

137
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,210
It's not your fault.

138
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,630
Even so…

139
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,320
Everyone is to blame.

140
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:51,810
Even when I saw Dong Hyeon die right before my eyes,

141
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,070
I couldn't do anything.

142
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,430
Hyeon Ho,

143
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,710
let's survive and get out of here.

144
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:13,300
I'll protect you, no matter what.

145
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,140
Will you?

146
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,400
Once we escape,

147
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,210
I want to watch your game.

148
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,790
Don't fall for me after you've watched the game.

149
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,900
   

150
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:56,640
Why on earth do you think

151
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,340
the person who created the Mafia game is doing this?

152
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,000
First, we need to find out who created this game and why.

153
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,670
Where do you think the creator of this game is?

154
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,370
We are the only ones here right now.

155
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,210
What if they come when we fall asleep?

156
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,960
That's when they killed Ju Won, too.

157
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,460
They said the mafia killed Ju Won,

158
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,940
but our class is the only one on the list of participants.

159
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,150
Any other participants would've been on the list.

160
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,980
You're right.

161
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,860
The mafia would have been selected when the roles were assigned.

162
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,420
Then…

163
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:48,400
does this mean that someone among us killed Ju Won?

164
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,540
If it's according to the rules,

165
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,160
I guess so.

166
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,850
Who do you think is the mafia?

167
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:11,030
Seeing as how Choi Ju Won died, wouldn't it be Go Gyeong Jun's group?

168
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:14,570
She's right. They harassed Choi Ju Won all the time.

169
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:19,190
I think Jin Ha and Seung Bin even borrowed a lot of money from Choi Ju Won.

170
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,660
I don't know about Choi Ju Won,

171
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,490
but mafia members usually try to kill civilians.

172
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,260
We might be able to tell from yesterday's votes.

173
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,860
 Let's kill Heo Yul first. 

174
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,790
Wait, why are you looking at me?

175
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:48,630
Well, Eun Ha, you're the one who suggested that we all vote for Heo Yul yesterday.

176
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,520
I just listened to you and voted.

177
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,640
Hey, Choi Mi Na!

178
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,540
Are you saying I'm the mafia?

179
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,620
Eun Ha,

180
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,400
why exactly did you accuse Yul of being Mafia?

181
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,870
It's not me.

182
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,140
Are you saying that I killed Yul on purpose?

183
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,240
Yul got all the votes under your guidance!

184
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,810
It's true!

185
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,170
That is true.

186
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,670
What's wrong with you guys?

187
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,080
Hey, Kim So Mi.

188
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,950
Then why did you do that?

189
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,290
Me?

190
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,430
Do what?

191
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,210
I saw how you pushed Dong Hyeon in the mountains.

192
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,680
He died because of you!

193
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,550
Are you crazy?

194
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,560
Did I push him?

195
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,420
Hey, that's not true!

196
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:03,080
I almost died trying to grab Kim Dong Hyeon as he fell!

197
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,340
Everyone else saw it happen. Stop bullshitting!

198
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,890
Guys, I honestly had no idea. It was just a joke.

199
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,440
She knew he was going to die, and she pushed him anyway!

200
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,290
I told you I didn't.

201
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,780
Hey, call Jun Hui and the others.

202
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,450
Ask the other guys!

203
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,780
Hey! Both of you, that's enough.

204
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,830
Nice!

205
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,340
What are you doing?

206
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:46,780
We can eat with you once we've confirmed whether you're an ally or foe.

207
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,860
What are you saying? Give me my phone!

208
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,400
Is this good?

209
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,790
Fucking shit!

210
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,970
Stay the fuck still!

211
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,790
You're dead if you make me spill it.

212
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,260
One hit per drop. Understood?

213
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,560
Shit. 
    

214
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,670
It's the same as ours. The role doesn't show up.

215
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,220
Shit.

216
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,380
Fuck! You son of a bitch, I got something on me!

217
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,760
G-Give it back now.

218
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,830
Hold on. I still need to check something.

219
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,720
Check what?

220
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,280
If I can use someone else's phone to vote,

221
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,520
I can target the votes as I please.

222
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,400
Kneel!

223
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,340
Let go! Let go of me! Let go!

224
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,120
Hey,

225
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,900
choose someone. I'll press it for you.

226
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,740
I don't want to.

227
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,670
Then I'll vote for you.

228
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:06,510
Hey, stop it. S-Stop it!

229
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,720
I said, stop it! Stop it!

230
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,630
I said, stop it! Seriously, stop it— 
    

231
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,670
   

232
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:18,640
Shit, I guess you can't vote on someone's behalf.

233
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,820
Hey, I have been looking for you everywhere.

234
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,210
Let's go. Everyone's about to vote.

235
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:37,350
Are they going to vote again after Yul's death?

236
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,960
The game has to end so we can go.

237
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,220
We have no choice.

238
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,290
Still, how can we do it again?

239
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,500
We have to stop them.

240
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,220
We shouldn't vote.

241
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,100
How can we stop them?

242
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,990
We need a plan to convince them.

243
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:56,050
I'll convince them. Are they all gathered?

244
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,690
No, they are in different rooms.

245
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,490
First, let's get everybody together.

246
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,740
I'm going to help you, too.

247
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,490
Where's Da Beom?

248
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,500
Go Gyeong Jun's group called him earlier.

249
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,780
Geez, those damn bastards.

250
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,770
They really get on my nerves.

251
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,160
I said, let go!

252
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,690
Hold on, will you?

253
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,400
Okay. Stay still.

254
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,520
Fuck, it doesn't work.

255
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,420
Hey!

256
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,710
That's enough.

257
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,990
What are you guys doing?

258
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,680
What the fuck?

259
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,900
- Da Beom, get up. 
 - Get up.

260
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,030
Stand up.

261
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,370
One against three?

262
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,070
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

263
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,860
Where do you think you're going?

264
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,330
Hey, hey, hey!

265
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,110
Hey, that's enough.

266
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,180
Come with us. We need to discuss something.

267
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,570
Why should I listen to you? Hey, you!

268
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,210
Damn it! Hey.

269
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,590
You motherfucker.

270
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,190
Why should I listen to you, you son of a bitch? Come here.

271
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,990
Fucking bastards.

272
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,100
Words don't get through to you, right?

273
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,570
You need a beating.

274
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,000
You son of a bitch!

275
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,630
Son of a bitch!

276
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:08,970
Let the fuck go! Let go, you son of a bitch.

277
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,820
Will you listen?

278
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,570
Will you do as we say?

279
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,600
All right, you motherf*cker!

280
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,120
Let's go.

281
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,430
Hey, hey, hey!

282
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,960
Let him go. Come here!

283
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:49,000
Hey! Just stop it, will you?

284
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:55,050
Should I tell everyone what you guys just did?

285
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,130
What will everyone think?

286
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:00,990
Get it together.

287
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,560
Why are you wasting your breath?

288
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:09,040
I think they'll all start voting once we give them the go-ahead.

289
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,930
How about it?

290
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,220
Should I click your name?

291
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,470
You fucking bitch.

292
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,910
Put this down.

293
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:20,610
We won't tell anyone, so put this down.

294
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,840
Just stop it now, please.

295
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,490
F***.

296
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,370
There will be a meeting in the auditorium.

297
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:46,130
I think you should come as well.

298
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,000
Keep the snack bar open for everyone.

299
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:23,070
   

300
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:26,050
The reason we gathered everyone

301
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,860
isn't to choose whom to vote for.

302
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,710
It's to convince you not to vote at all.

303
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,140
"Not to vote at all"?

304
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,880
Can we do that?

305
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,790
If we vote, someone will die, no matter what,

306
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,650
but if no one votes, everyone can live.

307
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:43,680
What if someone votes secretly after everyone agrees not to?

308
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,090
What happens then?

309
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,200
She's right. How can we trust everyone?

310
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,960
We have to get everyone to trust one another.

311
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,940
We can collect all the phones. Then no one can vote.

312
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:00,150
Yes, if we collect all the phones, no one will be able to vote.

313
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,500
We can do it.

314
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,330
Who will be in charge of the phones?

315
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,620
This person may change his or her mind.

316
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,520
We can collect them and leave them in the center of the room for all to see.

317
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,210
Yes, we can all keep an eye on them at all times.

318
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,970
What if someone steals them?

319
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:19,010
I don't want to. I'm not giving you mine.

320
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:22,680
This sounds like a good idea. Let's hand in ours.

321
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,750
Are you crazy?

322
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,850
Who would steal your phone? Just hand it over!

323
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,950
- I said, I don't want to! 
 - Are you a phone addict?

324
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,670
- Don't. 
 - What?

325
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:33,260
Why the fuck are you giving me all this shit?

326
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,590
No one will die if we hand them in.

327
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:37,880
You guys are fucking noisy.

328
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:42,250
The Class President is saying something right for once.

329
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,860
Why aren't you all cooperating?

330
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,720
You have to hand in your phone so no one can vote.

331
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,350
Every one of you better hand them in.

332
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:58,280
Hand it in while I say it nicely.

333
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,960
What are you waiting for? Hurry.

334
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,410
Come on, hurry!

335
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,450
Hurry. We're running out of time.

336
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:50,970
 One minute left until voting ends. 

337
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,760
Gosh…

338
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:03,120
Seriously, fuck!

339
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,410
Hey, Class President! Are you sure this is okay?

340
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:08,100
Let's wait for now.

341
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,680
It's not even midnight yet.

342
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,320
Hey…

343
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,890
Hey, hey! It's past midnight, and there's no announcement.

344
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,870
Did… Did it work?

345
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,460
We're fine now, right?

346
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,370
We did it!

347
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,220
- We did it! 
 - We're okay!

348
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,050
We're okay!

349
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,940
We're okay now, right?

350
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,360
 Participants must vote to track down the mafia. 

351
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,370
Hey! What are you doing?

352
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:31,020
What do you think?

353
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:35,640
If I do nothing and die, will you take the responsibility?

354
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,990
She's right.

355
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,210
Guys, hold on! Hold on!

356
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,090
We don't know that yet.

357
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,010
Know about what?

358
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,880
The game will simply continue as before.

359
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,250
If we die because of you, will you take responsibility?

360
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,100
Hey, hey!

361
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,290
Don't accuse Jun Hui for no reason. Calm down.

362
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:17,600
 Lee Su Bin and Park Ji Hun will be executed for violating the rules. 

363
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:41,360
 Lee Su Bin and Park Ji Hun were civilians. 

364
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,230
Everyone handed in their phones, right?

365
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:50,630
 Participants must vote to locate Mafia members. 

366
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,560
What the are you doing?

367
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,580
Find your phone unless you want to die.

368
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,730
Fuck!

369
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:01,170
We must vote! If we don't, we'll die!

370
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:10,790
 Oh Jin Seo will be executed for violating the rules. 

371
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:25,230
Kim Jun Hui, hurry!

372
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,170
Jun Hui.

373
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,880
What are you doing?

374
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:38,370
Kim Jun Hui!

375
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:07,970
 Oh Jin Seo was a civilian. 

376
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:22,900


377
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:29,340
Idiots.

378
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:35,990
   

379
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,540
   

380
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,010
