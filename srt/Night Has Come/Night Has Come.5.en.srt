00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,501
Are you okay? Answer me!

10
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,270
What if something happened to her?

11
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:09,770
Or should we get more people here?

12
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:12,680
I'm going in.

13
00:01:14,081 --> 00:01:15,880

Say something!

18
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:00,420
What was that?

19
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:31,480
I'm on the second floor. Something is off.

20
00:03:32,251 --> 00:03:33,251

You have six votes.

26
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:59,181
So if two more people vote, it will be over.

27
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,551
Hey, what should we do?

28
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:07,380
Isn't it obvious?

29
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,991
We must show them Park Woo Ram, that jerk, is the Mafia.

30
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,890
- Let's go. - Come on.

31
00:04:22,671 --> 00:04:25,671
I'm glad that you two are the last ones to vote.

32
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,700
- Vote now. - Okay. I'll do it now.

33
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
No.

34
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:32,140
Don't force us.

35
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,911
What?

36
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,510
Ji Soo.

37
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,380
I'm not...

38
00:04:40,921 --> 00:04:42,590
forcing you or anything.

39
00:04:43,251 --> 00:04:44,649
I'm just in a tight spot.

40
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,361
Put yourself in my shoes.

41
00:04:46,921 --> 00:04:48,621
It's either you or Ko Kyung Jun.

42
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,430
You barged in here, asking me to help you.

43
00:04:50,431 --> 00:04:52,260
How do you expect me to think clearly with all the pressure?

44
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,630
Don't be like that.

45
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,130
Don't tell me...

46
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:01,541
you think...

47
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,171
I'm the Mafia.

48
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,710
Who knows?

49
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,041
Can you leave, so we can think by ourselves?

50
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:14,150
Darn it.

51
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:20,161
Hey, Woo Ram.

52
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,340
Woo Ram.

53
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,611
How could they do this to me?

54
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,080
How?

55
00:05:46,751 --> 00:05:47,880
Darn it. Come on.

56
00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:51,491
It all happened very fast. Ji Soo must be just flustered.

57
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,921
I'll try to talk to her.

58
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:55,720
Why don't you stay in the room for now?

59
00:05:56,191 --> 00:05:57,231
Okay?

60
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,830
Okay.

61
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,751

76
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,631

77
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,771

No. They're talking on the third floor.

Yu Jun.

86
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,941
You should vote for Kyung Jun now.

87

Okay. I'll do that.

88
00:10:42,311 --> 00:10:43,551
Don't force him.

89
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:46,220

90

What's more to think about?

91
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,020
It's not just anyone. It's Woo Ram.

92
00:10:51,021 --> 00:10:52,021
Why not?

93
00:10:52,421 --> 00:10:54,320
Let's be honest. He badmouthed Ju Young all the time.

94
00:10:55,161 --> 00:10:56,860
This has nothing to do with that.

95

Right, Ji Soo. Let's side with Woo Ram.

We need to find the Mafia, so we can go home! Seriously.

100
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,641
I don't trust anyone. It doesn't matter if he's my friend.

101
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,881

103
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,120

113
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:02,860
Where's Woo Ram?

114
00:12:05,431 --> 00:12:06,700
I told him to stay in the room.

115
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:08,330
Let's go and look for him.

116
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,340
Yu Jun is alone?

117
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,181
Yes.

118
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:28,020
He wanted to talk to you in private about the vote without Ji Soo.

119
00:12:28,021 --> 00:12:29,720
So...

120
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:41,401
Hey, Yu Jun.

121
00:12:45,801 --> 00:12:48,200
Darn it. Hey, move him.

122
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:51,411
Stall a bit more time.

123
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,080
I'll show you how I take down the Mafia.

124
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,990

125
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,360
Hey, turn on the light.

126
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,661
- Hurry up. - Check there.

127
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:13,561

128
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:16,830

132
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,411
He's not in here either.

133
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,480
That's it. Let's split up and look for him.

134
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,151
Okay.

135
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,921
Woo Ram!

136
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,691
Woo Ram!

137
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,901
Just tell the truth, you jerk.

138
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
Stop it.

139
00:13:49,301 --> 00:13:50,370
Come on.

140
00:13:51,271 --> 00:13:52,531
Say it!

141
00:13:53,671 --> 00:13:56,141
Stop it. Please.

142
00:14:02,881 --> 00:14:05,210
You jerk! How dare you try to kill me?

143
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,220
Hey.

144
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:15,021
Wake up.

145
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:18,460
I think he passed out.

146
00:14:19,431 --> 00:14:21,161
Hey. Wake up.

147
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,131
He might be pretending.

148
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,000
Ji Soo, it's past 11pm. Are you going to vote?

149
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,401
Let's just vote for Ko Kyung Jun.

150
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,171
Wait.

151
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,369
I thought you needed time to think.

152
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,681
Why are you in a rash?

153
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,281
We just have to vote before midnight.

154
00:15:12,151 --> 00:15:13,480
Spend some more time to think.

155
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,891
Park Woo Ram.

156

Park Woo Ram.

159
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:52,090
Jung Won.

160
00:15:55,891 --> 00:15:57,031
Where's Yoon Seo?

161
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:58,791
I don't know. I didn't see her.

162
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,500
I went all the way, and it was a dead end.

163
00:16:02,401 --> 00:16:04,271
- A dead end? - Yes.

164
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,171
I think we have to look for her outside.

165
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:08,970
Okay.

166
00:16:29,161 --> 00:16:31,261
Jung Won. Oh Jung Won.

167
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,360
What?

168
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,870
Yoon Seo.

169
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,301
Yoon Seo, I was worried about you.

170
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,311
- Are you okay? - Yes.

171
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,710
I fell to the basement.

172
00:16:50,411 --> 00:16:52,651
Then I found a room with CCTVs.

173
00:16:53,521 --> 00:16:55,980
When I got out, I was suddenly on the second floor.

174
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,520
I walked...

175
00:16:59,091 --> 00:17:01,621
for a long time, but I kept circling around.

176
00:17:03,161 --> 00:17:04,691
I barely escaped.

177
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,300
You fell to the basement, but how did you get to the second floor?

178
00:17:09,331 --> 00:17:10,770
And it was...

179
00:17:12,171 --> 00:17:13,401
a dead end.

180
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,040
I'm telling you the truth.

181
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:20,911
And I found this.

182
00:17:23,411 --> 00:17:24,411
Are they from our school?

183
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,411
I think they were our seniors.

184
00:17:27,621 --> 00:17:28,651
But I'm not sure.

185
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,790
What happened to their faces?

186
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,790
It's creepy.

187
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,431
I think she is...

188
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,131
the ghost I saw.

189
00:17:43,931 --> 00:17:44,970
What?

190
00:17:47,141 --> 00:17:48,171
Yoon Seo.

191
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,671
Is Woo Ram here?

192
00:17:52,441 --> 00:17:54,641
- No. - He said he'd wait in his room.

193
00:17:55,081 --> 00:17:56,310
He suddenly disappeared.

194
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:06,760
There's no time.

195
00:18:07,091 --> 00:18:08,361
Spill it out already.

196
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,230
There's no time, jerk!

197
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,441
Look how dogged he is.

198
00:18:35,421 --> 00:18:36,750
He's the Mafia for sure.

199
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,240
Grab him.

200
00:18:55,171 --> 00:18:56,200
Grab him!

201
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,881
Stop it.

202
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,010
Don't do this.

203
00:19:07,621 --> 00:19:10,120
Stop it, jerk.

204
00:19:10,121 --> 00:19:12,020
Stop what? I haven't even started yet.

205
00:19:12,621 --> 00:19:13,990
No!

206
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,931
I never liked your eyes.

207
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,631
Should I shove them out?

208
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:29,670
So you should've cooperated.

209
00:19:29,671 --> 00:19:31,071
Why did you get on my nerves?

210
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,210
Woo Ram.

211
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,790
Woo Ram!

212
00:19:44,621 --> 00:19:45,750
Park Woo Ram!

213
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,161
Is he on the second floor?

214
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,530
No.

215
00:19:52,661 --> 00:19:54,200
He's not on the first floor or in the basement.

216
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,161
Should we check the other building?

217
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:02,300
I'm Park Woo Ram.

218
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,040
What's that?

219
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,050
I'm the Mafia.

220
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:17,121
I killed Lee Ju Young.

221
00:20:18,391 --> 00:20:19,450
What's Park Woo Ram doing?

222
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,621
What's he saying?

223
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:24,591
- To the studio. - I wasn't...

224
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,361
planning to do that at first,

225
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,371
but I got upset because he humiliated me.

226
00:20:33,371 --> 00:20:35,040
Because he always belittled me,

227
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,340
I wanted to kill him.

228
00:20:37,341 --> 00:20:38,871
He's crazy.

229
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,681
- Park Woo Ram? - What's he saying?

230
00:20:47,321 --> 00:20:48,881
He said he's the Mafia.

231
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:12,441
Happy now?

232
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,810
Are you happy now, jerk!

233
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,151
You should've confessed in the first place.

234
00:21:23,621 --> 00:21:25,891
Woo Ram. Park Woo Ram!

235
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,060
Hey!

236
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,290
Hey. Open the door.

237
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,431
Hey! Open the door now.

238
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,131
Guys. I'm in here.

239
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,810
Hey!

240
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:45,571
Hey!

241
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,050
Move.

242
00:21:57,391 --> 00:21:58,421
Give me that.

243
00:21:58,921 --> 00:21:59,990
Stay away.

244
00:22:09,131 --> 00:22:10,131
Shoot.

245
00:22:10,132 --> 00:22:11,500
Darn it, Kim Jun Hee.

246
00:22:14,341 --> 00:22:15,500
You crazy junks!

247
00:22:16,071 --> 00:22:17,071
Gosh.

248
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:19,911
You're crazy.

249
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,480
You're lunatics!

250
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:26,111
Are you okay?

251
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:27,450
My goodness.

252
00:22:27,921 --> 00:22:29,821
Who's real crazy here?

253
00:22:30,621 --> 00:22:33,020
He's the Mafia. He killed Lee Ju Young.

254
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,460
Cut it out.

255
00:22:36,091 --> 00:22:38,131
Come to your senses, idiot.

256
00:22:59,881 --> 00:23:00,881
Look.

257
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:02,651
It's over now.

258
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:05,949
(Park Ji Soo voted for Park Woo Ram.)

259
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,760
(Cha Yu Jun voted for Park Woo Ram.)

260
00:23:20,571 --> 00:23:21,641
Shoot!

261
00:23:23,641 --> 00:23:26,470
I should've killed Ko Kyung Jun first.

262
00:23:30,141 --> 00:23:32,280
I'd be an idiot if I just die.

263
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,560
Shoot.

264
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,900
Hey.

265
00:23:49,901 --> 00:23:50,999
- Hey. - Hey.

266
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,831
- Hey. - Come with me.

267
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:54,371
Jerk!

268
00:23:54,871 --> 00:23:55,970
Be careful.

269
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
Are you crazy?

270
00:23:57,241 --> 00:23:58,740
Do something.

271
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,280
I'll kill you before I die!

272
00:24:07,681 --> 00:24:09,921
Even if it weren't me, someone would kill you.

273
00:24:10,921 --> 00:24:13,421
Die, you jerk!

274
00:24:15,391 --> 00:24:17,331
Voting is over.

275
00:24:22,101 --> 00:24:25,631
Park Woo Ram with the most votes will be executed.

276
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:39,950
What the...

277
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:47,861
Oh, no.

278
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,601
Park Woo Ram was the Mafia.

279
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,770
See? I told you.

280
00:25:44,851 --> 00:25:46,410
Get out of my way.

281
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:47,651
- Go. - Don't touch me.

282
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,651
Hurry up.

283
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,020
Come on.

284
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:55,621
No.

285
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,040
Stay here.
