1
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:15,590


2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,590
   

3
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,760
   

4
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,890
   

5
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,030
   

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,370
   

7
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,680
   

8
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,640
- Crazy bitch! 
 - Just let go and talk. 
  

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,270
How can you say that after having seeing this?

10
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,060
It's not me!

11
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,440
P-Please hear me out. Really…

12
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,470
What's wrong?

13
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,900
What's there to hear? You're a mafia.

14
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,390
Nam Yeon Wu is wounded.

15
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,810
I swear it isn't me.

16
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,300
It isn't me.

17
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,480
It really isn't.

18
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,150
Hey, Loser Beom, why did you check the camera by yourself?

19
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,720
- You're a mafia, aren't you? 
 - I'm not a mafia!

20
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,390
Stop lying, you Mafia bastard!

21
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,070
I was just checking if it was done charging!

22
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,870
Why did you get injured?

23
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,360
I really don't know.

24
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,220
I was like this when I woke up in the morning.

25
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,770
Does this make sense?

26
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,440
- You're a mafia, aren't you? 
 - Fucking seriously…

27
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,340
 Nam Yeon Wu… 

28
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,680
 - voted for Jin Dae Beom.  
 - What are you doing?

29
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,190
 Jin Dae Beom voted for… 

30
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,880
 - Nam Yeon Wu.  
 - Hey.

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,430
Just like yesterday.

32
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,310
You also came out late this morning.

33
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,630
Those two plotted together, okay?

34
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,250
So Mi, Na Hui, Gyeong Jun, Wu Ram, and Ju Yeong.

35
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,750
They are all connected to them.

36
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,830
Crazy bastard. Why would I kill Ju Yeong?

37
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,490
Because you're a mafia!

38
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,620
That's why that stuff was only on your shoes.

39
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,560
Then what about that wound?

40
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,210
You put it on my shoes behind my back. You pig!

41
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,950
Shut up, you Mafia bitch!

42
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,740
Fuck.

43
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,180
Fuck!

44
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,700
 - Choi Mi Na voted for Nam Yeon Wu.  
 - The one with the wound is the mafia, right?

45
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,110
Why aren't you voting?

46
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,730
Yes, that bastard is part of the mafia!

47
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,710
Hey, why don't you hurry?

48
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,290
Shut up.

49
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,180
Did you really come to check if it was charged?

50
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,430
I told everyone to wait. Why did you come alone?

51
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,710
Hey, I was worried because no one was here.

52
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,130
A mafia member could have come in and touched it.

53
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,070
They deleted the CCTV footage. They could've messed up the camera, too.

54
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,990
If you thought that, you wouldn't have come alone.

55
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,570
You would have told me to avoid looking suspicious.

56
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:15,120
Maybe you tried to delete the camera footage like you did with the CCTV!

57
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,390
You didn't come to check if it was charged.

58
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,760
You wanted to see if you were caught and tried to delete it!

59
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,810
I said it's not like that!

60
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,120
Hey. I didn't delete anything. I was just looking!

61
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,760
You can't accuse me of being part of the mafia.

62
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,460
You're the only bastard looking for a camera!

63
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,330
- What are you doing? 
  - Lee Yun Seo… 

64
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,430
 - voted for Jin Da Beom.  
 - I said it's not me. I'm not a mafia!

65
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,940
 Kim Jun Hui voted for… 

66
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,230
 - Jin Da Beom.  
 - Yes. I'm saying these guys are the mafia.

67
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,070
Hey. Hurry.

68
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,340
Vote for that bastard today,

69
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,600
and vote for Choi Mi Na tomorrow.

70
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,840
Then it would be game over.

71
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,910
By the way, Nam Yeon Wu.

72
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,790
You have a wound, and you don't even know how you got it.

73
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,520
So why did you hide it?

74
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,480
You even hid it from Im Eun Chan.

75
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,860
Because you might have found it's suspicious if I told you—

76
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,550
You should've been honest.

77
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,660
Why did you complicate things?

78
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,650
Shit. Why are you doing this now, too?

79
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:25,230
None of us knew a mafia member had a wound in the morning,

80
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,870
but it's strange that you hid it all day to avoid suspicion.

81
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:34,380
Yes. He couldn't tell us because he felt guilty about being Mafia.

82
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,630
Hey. You'd better be careful,

83
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,790
he will kill you today.

84
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,330
Shut up, you Mafia bastard!

85
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:46,040
They're putting on a show when they're both the mafia.

86
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,740
Just vote for one of them! Hurry!

87
00:04:54,630 --> 00:05:00,250
 Oh Jeong Won voted for Nam Yeon Wu. 

88
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,900
Hey.

89
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,490
You killed Na Hui, didn't you?

90
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,180
Fuck!

91
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,300
- Hey. 
 - Jeong Won.

92
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,920
This time it's definitely Nam Yeon Wu.

93
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,060
He has a wound, too.

94
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,560
- You b*tch! 
 - Don't.

95
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,830
- Let go, you bastard! 
 - What are you doing?

96
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,270
Hey, move!

97
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,350
Hey. Nam Yeon Wu.

98
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,470
Why aren't you voting for that bastard?

99
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,560
Why are you hesitating?

100
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,900
Are you suspicious of me, too?

101
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,430
I-It's not that, but you are the only one injured. So explain…

102
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,100
Shit. Explain what?

103
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,150
If that's the case, you and I were together last night. How come I was the only one stabbed?

104
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,520
Did you stab me?

105
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,480
- What? 
 - Isn't that why you told everyone

106
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,130
that I went to the clinic?

107
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,470
You Mafia bastard!

108
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,330
That's enough! Please stop.

109
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,170
Fucking hell!

110
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,880
Fucking seriously.

111
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,930
Why?

112
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,630
Why are you doing this to me

113
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,090
instead of finding the mafia who stabbed me?

114
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:19,620
The pain is killing me.

115
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:32,270
 Im Eun Chan voted for Nam Yeon Wu. 

116
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,640
You're the one who hid it. Why?

117
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,930
You should've been honest with me, at least.

118
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,440
You couldn't tell me because it's true, right?

119
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,930
Hey.

120
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,290
I don't know about everyone else,

121
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,300
but how could you be suspicious of me…

122
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,120
and vote for me?

123
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,350
H-Hey, it's not like that—

124
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,330
How could you vote for me?

125
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,730
Aren't you guys going to hide?

126
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,420
Hey.

127
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,860
Hey, Jin Da Beom.

128
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,360
Hey!

129
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,110
Hey!

130
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,840
Why me?

131
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,800
Aish!

132
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,780
Fuck!

133
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,720
Aish...

134
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,110
Those assholes…

135
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,660
Mom…

136
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:32,800
Please spare me. Mom…

137
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,950
   

138
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,720
Look at this. There's something here.

139
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,320
We must also go now. There's no time.

140
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,180
Jin Da Beom. It's that bastard.

141
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,810
I saw him smiling earlier.

142
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,070
He smiled because Yeon Wu was targeted as the mafia.

143
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,520
We're already done with the voting. What can we do?

144
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,080
Let's go for now.

145
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,780
I'm leaving.

146
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,460
You guys should hide as well.

147
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,410
Aren't you coming with us?

148
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,870
Being together is more dangerous.

149
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,860
Let's hide separately today.

150
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,600
See you in the morning.

151
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,750
Yun Seo, we have to hide, too. There's no time.

152
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,130
Jeong Won,

153
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,950
how did you know Na Hui hid in there?

154
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,100
Jun Hui never told us. Did he?

155
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,310
Hey, Jin Da Beom.

156
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,950
Shit!

157
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,690
Hey!

158
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,460
What are you doing?

159
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,600
Why did you do that?

160
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,610
Why did you do that to the innocent kids?

161
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,430
Hey, I'm a civilian. Why are you doing this to me?

162
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,530
Give me a damn break!

163
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,270
You killed her.

164
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,230
Why won't you believe me?

165
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,440
You'll find out once you die.

166
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,100
- Hey… 
 - Hey!

167
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,750
Aish!

168
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,250
Aish!

169
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,350
Fuck.

170
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,910
We are just trying to survive together.

171
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,380
I'm not your friend or anything like that,

172
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,640
so you think I can just die. Don't you?

173
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,220
You're the one who actually thinks that way.

174
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,270
It's you.

175
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:40,010
You killed everyone so you can survive alone.

176
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,880
Fuck. How are you any different from Gyeong Jun?

177
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,450
Fuck. Don't bring Go Gyeong Jun up.

178
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,190
What do you know?

179
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,230
Look.

180
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,780
Just look. Fuck!

181
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,410
Look at this!

182
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:11,330
I have tried to kill myself several times over Gyeong Jun and his gang.

183
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,000
You paid no attention to me

184
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,940
when I was being tortured.

185
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,600
What the fuck did you do?

186
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,750
You just pretended to be nice in front of everyone. You haven't fixed anything.

187
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,350
You weren't even interested in actually helping me!

188
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:34,100
What right do you have to say such a thing?

189
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,410
Someone like you is way more… disgusting

190
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,950
than Gyeong Jun and his gang.

191
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,660
Do you know that?

192
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,980
If you can't kill me, at least beg for your life.

193
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,700
I guess I might die a second time.

194
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,410
Just don't hurt Yun Seo and the rest.

195
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,810
Aish.

196
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,150
Fuck!

197
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,330
Anyone could've guessed that.

198
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:40,300
It was the only place she could have hidden.

199
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,910
How could…

200
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,000
How could anyone find that spot?

201
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:53,910
She must've hidden somehow since she wanted to live.

202
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,950
Yeon Wu's wound…

203
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,010
Did you do it?

204
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,850
Na Hui…

205
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,070
 Hold on. 

206
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,060
 What's that? 

207
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,750
And Yeon Wu…

208
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,850
The CCTV…

209
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:17,330
 If you kill Lee Yun Seo or Go Gyeong Jun now, 

210
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,910
 you guys will be suspected first. 

211
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,650
 So what are we supposed to do? 

212
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,570
 If we are lucky, we can deal with Go Gyeong Jun, 

213
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:37,550
 Kim Jin Ha, and Shin Seung Bin. All three at once. 

214
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,130
 Do you want to give it a try? 

215
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,690
 Did you kill them? 

216
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,380
Why…

217
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,700
won't you say anything?

218
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,780
You didn't, right?

219
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,730
Say you didn't do it,

220
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,160
and I'll believe you.

221
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,770
Say you didn't!

222
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:14,280
Say you didn't, please! Say you didn't! Please!

223
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,890
Why did you do it? Why? Why?

224
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,190
It's true.

225
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,920
If you knew that,

226
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,720
you should have just run away.

227
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,580
Shit. The keys.

228
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,400
Fuck!

229
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,220
Die.

230
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,630
Die.

231
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,010
Let's go together, you Mafia bitch.

232
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,490
- Die. 
 - I'm not Mafia, fuck…

233
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,140
I don't care.

234
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,120
You're a murderer because you voted for me.

235
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,170
Die.

236
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,380
D-Don't kill me…

237
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,030
 The voting has ended. 

238
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:13,820
 Nam Yeon Wu, the one with the most votes, will be executed. 

239
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,470
 Nam Yeon Wu is a Civilian. 

240
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:35,700
Y-Y-Yeon Wu... Y-Yeon Wu...

241
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,500
Yeon Wu…

242
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,760
Please let them live.

243
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,660
I…

244
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:52,040
I don't want to watch them die anymore.

245
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,680
It's too exhausting.

246
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,830
I want to stop playing the game.

247
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,340
Please don't kill them.

248
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:40,920
 Follow Mafia's rule. 

249
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:52,460
 You must have a Mafia meeting and unanimously pick a person for execution. 

250
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,400
Gosh! Fucking hell!

251
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,790
Hey.

252
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,180
What's with the camera?

253
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,440
Why didn't you tell me?

254
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,950
It happened all of a sudden.

255
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,670
I didn't think that variable existed, either.

256
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,640
You should've told me what was going to happen!

257
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,950
I thought I was going to die.

258
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,290
That's why I helped you.

259
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:34,300
- You didn't die, thanks to me. 
 - What?

260
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,100
The three of us are always together. What could I have done?

261
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:41,530
I would've looked suspicious if I came to see you.

262
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,170
Okay.

263
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,400
What happened to your face?

264
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,650
Fuck!

265
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,860
The class president asked me to kill him

266
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,580
but not to hurt you guys.

267
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,120
So…

268
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,350
did you see where everyone went?

269
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,250
The Class President is in the restroom,

270
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,370
and the rest are in the annex.

271
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,380
What will you do now?

272
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,740
No matter who you kill, tomorrow you'll be suspected.

273
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,660
Damn.

274
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,280
There's really no answer.

275
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,860
As you said, no matter who I kill,

276
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,710
everyone will vote for me tomorrow.

277
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:02,490
By the way, do you think you can win without me?

278
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,240
She's a civilian, too.

279
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,070
She's not on your side.

280
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,660
There aren't that many people left.

281
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,070
Of course, they'll be suspicious of you, too.

282
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,690
You can never win on your own.

283
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,850
The longer you drag it, the worse off you'll be.

284
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,130
This time we do things my way.

285
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,660
How?

286
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,930
Well…

287
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,320
we don't have to kill just one person.

288
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,570
You want to kill everyone today?

289
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,130
Look what happened to Yu Jun.

290
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:42,380
They killed him during the day, but nothing happened.

291
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,530
Let's just…

292
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,130
kill everyone.

293
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,270
Okay.

294
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,370
Then I'll take care of Yun Seo and Jun Hui.

295
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,520
You can go to the annex.

296
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,210
- Do you want me to go alone? 
 - There's no time.

297
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,470
We can't even check the CCTV. How do we find them all?

298
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,510
We need to move separately.

299
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,100
By the way, you've only planned so far.

300
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,770
You haven't killed anyone yourself yet.

301
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,550
Are you really able to kill Lee Yun Seo?

302
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,390
If we're going to kill them anyway, it's better I do it than you.

303
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,820
All right.

304
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:57,990
Good luck.

305
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,340
Stabbing with a knife is quick. Should I do it for you?

306
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,890
I said I don't want to do stuff like that.

307
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,600
It doesn't matter how. We just have to kill her.

308
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,020
It's not just anyone.

309
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,500
It's Yun Seo.

310
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,080
Let me do at least this much.

311
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:58,350
If we leave her here, she'll die in thirty minutes anyway.

312
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,460
Fine.

313
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,890
Check if she died after thirty minutes and message me.

314
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:10,400
Make sure to take care of the class president, too.

315
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,380
What's this?

316
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,090
Shit.

317
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,310
 I took care of Jun Hui. 

318
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,490
So we can kill everyone.

319
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,490
Shit. It got cold.

320
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,620
 Did you find everyone? 

321
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,530
 I'm still looking for the two. 

322
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,110
 Wait a moment. 

323
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:00,410
 How about Lee Yun Seo? How did that go? 

324
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,450
 She's dead. 

325
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,360
 Are you sure she's dead? 

326
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,760
 If you don't trust me, come to the freezer and check yourself. 

327
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:06,290
    
    

328
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,060
 I'm on my way now. 

329
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:23,910


330
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:31,400
Check quickly, and let's go find the rest.

331
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,960
Hey.

332
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,140
Move that sheet.

333
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,260
What?

334
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:47,980
Fucking get moving!

335
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,810
Why are you doing this?

336
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,280
You can check for yourself.

337
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,830
Fuck!  Seriously.

338
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,590
You can't…

339
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:08,420
still consider me a loser and a pushover, Jeong Won.

340
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,830
Well?

341
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,950
Why would this turn on if she's dead?

342
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,350
Why didn't you kill Lee Yun Seo?

343
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:24,380
Fuck! Why didn't you kill her?

344
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,270
If you really can't kill her,

345
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,650
you should die, too.

346
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:02,450
   

347
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,100
   

348
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,500
