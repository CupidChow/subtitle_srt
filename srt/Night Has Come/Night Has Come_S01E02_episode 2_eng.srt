1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:09,020


2
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,520
   

3
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,690
   

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,730
   

5
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,930
   

6
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,410
   

7
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,720
   

8
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:10,300
   

9
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,870
   

10
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,720
   

11
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,380
   

12
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,790
What happened?

13
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,430
   

14
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,310
I don't know...

15
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:48,340
What do we do with Yul? Yul...

16
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,540
What do we do...

17
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:19,310
 Before the last voting ended, the police officer used their power. 

18
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,820
 Choi Ju Won was executed by the mafia. 

19
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,390
 Choi Ju Won was the mafia. 

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,420
 All participants, please find the mafia and start voting. 

21
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,900
Where is Ju Won?

22
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,610
The announcement...

23
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,170
Who is making this announcement?

24
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,110
Why do we keep hearing this right now?

25
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,900
The broadcasting room is on the second floor.

26
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,810
Let's go there! Let's go.

27
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,170
Shit.

28
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,890
Hey!

29
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,740
Shit. Class President, go and open it.

30
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,770
What?

31
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,050
What? What is it?

32
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,870
   

33
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,550
He's dead...

34
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,280
The mafia...

35
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,390
T-This is because of the mafia game.

36
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,640
What if we all die, too?

37
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,770
Shut up, you jerk. No one's dying.

38
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,580
Hey, Lee Yun Seo.

39
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,420
Hey, what are you doing?

40
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,860
The blood hasn't dried yet.

41
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,680
It hasn't been long since he died.

42
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,040
Hey, Class President.

43
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,070
What will you do now?

44
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,790
What will you do now?

45
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,970
First...

46
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,780
we need to get out of here.

47
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:13,880
Tell everyone that we need to get out of here.

48
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,880
Yun Seo.

49
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,120
 Everyone, get out of the building. Hurry! 
   

50
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,260
Let's hurry and get out of here!

51
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,900
Hurry.

52
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,580
   

53
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,470
   

54
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,640
Where do we go now that we're out?

55
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,730
I saw a gas station over there. Let's go there.

56
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,790
Your phone isn't working, right?

57
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,170
No, it isn't.

58
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,020
What's that?

59
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,810
 The game has to be played within the designated area. 

60
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,670
 The game has to be played within the designated area. 

61
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,520
What does that mean?

62
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,740
Wh-What is it saying?

63
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,520
   

64
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,860
Fuck. Seriously.

65
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,780
   

66
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,420
I think it's telling us not to leave.

67
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,590
What do we do?

68
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,740
Guys, hold on.

69
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,270
Don't leave and stay for a moment.

70
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,060
Why?

71
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,250
Something is strange.

72
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,660
Are you going to believe this bullshit?

73
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,520
Fuck, whatever! Let's just go!

74
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,340
 Sang Hwan! No! 

75
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,940
- Hey, hey! 
 - No!

76
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,570
Don't just leave like that!

77
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,940
Sang Hwan, I told you not to.

78
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:24,410
 Lee Sang Hwan is being executed for breaking the rule. 

79
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:31,150
 Kim Hyeong Seok is being executed for breaking the rule. 

80
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,070
Stop.

81
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,000
Gosh, don't go...

82
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,570
Hyeong Seok!

83
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,420
Hyeong Seok!

84
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,440
Hyeong Seok...

85
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,280
Hey! Hey! Hey!

86
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,040
Sang Hwan!

87
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,780
Lee Sang Hwan!

88
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,780
Guys, what are you doing? What's wrong?

89
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,640
- What the hell? 
 - Hold on.

90
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,980
What are you doing? Stop!

91
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,950
- Stop! 
 - Stop doing that!

92
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,250
Stop!

93
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,210
I said stop!

94
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,310
Why are they doing this?

95
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,950
Don't do that!

96
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,990
Fuck! Stop!

97
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,850
Stop, I said!

98
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,430
Stop! Please!

99
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,620
Hey, hey, stop that.

100
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,110
- Hyeong Seok. 
 - Stop, I said!

101
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,530
Don't do that.

102
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,750
No, no!

103
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,290
Don't do that, you bastard...

104
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:41,930
 Lee Sang Hwan and Kim Hyeong Seok were civilians. 

105
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,720
Fuck. Seriously. Why is the phone not working? Fuck!

106
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,110
What do we do now?

107
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,080
Won't we die, too, if we stay here?

108
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,440
The teacher will come back soon.

109
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,160
Let's wait.

110
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,300
No one is coming.

111
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:36,090
How long do we have to stay with the dead bodies? I don't want to!

112
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:40,200
Don't call them the dead bodies.

113
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,710
But they're dead.

114
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,290
They're dead. What am I supposed to call them?

115
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:49,220
Hey, say something. We need to go home!

116
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,140
Hey,

117
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,230
please be quiet.

118
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:57,210
You saw what happened to them when they tried to leave. And you still say that?

119
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,450
Then leave by yourself.

120
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:08,540
Kim So Mi, do you really not know when the teacher is coming back?

121
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,590
I don't. He can't be reached. How should I know?

122
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,410
This fucking sucks.

123
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,670
   

124
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,560
   

125
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,010
   

126
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,920
What are you doing?

127
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,200
Just in case it worked.

128
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,750
What did it say earlier?

129
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,490
It said not to leave the area, right?

130
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:36,810
"The game has to be played within the designated area."

131
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,750
What if that area is...

132
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,820
defined by that line?

133
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,410
We heard the announcement when they tried to cross the line.

134
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,360
You're right. We can't cross the line.

135
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,560
How far does it go?

136
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,730
Which line is the real one?

137
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,400
Maybe we can leave through where the line disconnects.

138
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,020
Let's go.

139
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,340
The mountains are accessible between the trails.

140
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,200
If you keep going, there's a village.

141
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,910
We just need to go where the people are and ask for help.

142
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,150
Be careful!

143
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,510
 The game has to be played within the designated area. 

144
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,170
What if you leave and die like they did earlier?

145
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,950
- What will you do then? 
 - I know.

146
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,790
Isn't it too dangerous?

147
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,320
Let's go somewhere else.

148
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,700
Okay.

149
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,130
No, it's safe as long as you don't cross the line.

150
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,390
 I think we can keep walking to the end while staying inside the line. 

151
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,390
- You're not getting a notification, right? 
 - No.

152
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:00,330
Is the line really the only thing we need to worry about?

153
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,290
   

154
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,170
It sucks to keep waiting.

155
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,640
It won't be a bad idea to try going, too.

156
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,710
But do we all need to go? It'd be fucking inefficient.

157
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,270
You're right;

158
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,010
we can't all go. I'll go on my own.

159
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,580
I'll come with you then.

160
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,090
No, you should stay. The trail might be treacherous.

161
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:28,700
Yes, you don't want to slow him down.

162
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,980
- Let's just stay. 
 - He can't go alone.

163
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,690
We'll come with you.

164
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,150
Wh-Why me?

165
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,300
Na Hui, Ji Su,

166
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,900
- and Cha Yu Jin, you're coming too, right? 
 - No, I'm not going.

167
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,440
Well, then I won't go, either.

168
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,130
Don't you have any sense of loyalty?

169
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,170
Na Hui, are you not coming, either?

170
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,600
Look at you guys.

171
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,780
You're too weak to hike properly.

172
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,290
We'll come, too.

173
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,920
I-I'll go, too.

174
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,400
Why?

175
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,240
Are you going?

176
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,530
You don't know what'll happen if you go.

177
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,290
It's dangerous.

178
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,430
You guys should stay here.

179
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,770
Jun Hui,

180
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,880
be careful.

181
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,110
Okay, I'll be right back.

182
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:50,980
Everyone, be careful.

183
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,620
Be careful.

184
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,820
Hey. Let's go, guys.

185
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,410
Okay.

186
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:08,530
   

187
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,990
 Yun Seo. 

188
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,270
   

189
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,810
- What did you say? 
 - What?

190
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,470
What do you mean?

191
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,350
Didn't you call me?

192
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,790
Me?

193
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,710
I didn't.

194
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,010
Aren't you coming?

195
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,520
Coming.

196
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,510
Push me.

197
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,370
Be careful.

198
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,610
Wow.

199
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,870
This is amazing.

200
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:00,610
   

201
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:05,570
All cafeterias have freezers, right?

202
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,230
Yes, probably.

203
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,760
Why do you ask?

204
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,240
Ju Won and Yul...

205
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,670
Let's move them there.

206
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,060
What?

207
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,450
How are we supposed to do that?

208
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,450
I thought we weren't supposed to touch them before the police came.

209
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,610
Just think about it.

210
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:29,130
We don't even know when the police will come.

211
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,930
It's hot out. I don't think we should leave them there like that.

212
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,560
Hold on.

213
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,830
Why do you keep taking photos?

214
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,980
I'm done.

215
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,820
We need to take photos so we can catch the culprit later.

216
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,820
Why are you doing the police's job?

217
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,570
What is it?

218
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,590
I found the phone.

219
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,460
They must've hit Ju Won's head with this.

220
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,760
Let's finish it quickly and go.

221
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,260
Okay.

222
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,610
Give me the blanket.

223
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,370
Hold on.

224
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,230
He only has wounds on his forehead.

225
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,970
He must've been hit from the front.

226
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,270
Did they wait until he came out and hit him?

227
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:02,520
That's enough. What's the point of us knowing about that right now?

228
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,730
Because it's strange.

229
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:09,170
People instinctively dodge when someone hits them.

230
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:14,210
His head was hurt badly, but his hands and arms are fine.

231
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,690
There's no sign of protecting himself.

232
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,500
If this was really because of the game,

233
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,210
he would have been awake since he was in the mafia.

234
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,780
Why did he get beaten without protecting himself?

235
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,710
It's strange.

236
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:37,720
But why did they kill their fellow mafia member?

237
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,240
You go first.

238
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:17,630
Be careful.

239
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,860
Are you okay?

240
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,310
Yes.

241
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,860
Na Hui, are you okay?

242
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,340
Yes.

243
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,040
Hey! Na Hui!

244
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,620
- What? 
 - Na Hui!

245
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,640
Are you okay?

246
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,680
I think she sprained her leg.

247
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,420
She can't walk like this. We need to stabilize it.

248
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,230
She should've been careful.

249
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,610
Na Hui, are you okay?

250
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,300
Yes.

251
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,450
She doesn't seem okay.

252
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,780
Let's go back since she got injured.

253
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,750
Do you want to go back now?

254
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:20,930
But we came all the way here. Let's go a little further. Please?

255
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,990
But she can't walk right now.

256
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:26,950
She'd be in pain whether she goes back or keeps going.

257
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:31,620
She should keep going if she can endure.

258
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,790
Na Hui.

259
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,140
- Na Hui. 
 - What?

260
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,870
You're really okay, right?

261
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,760
Yes.

262
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:53,840
Try going a little further, and let us know if it hurts too much.

263
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,430
We can either take a break or go back then.

264
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:00,030
That'd be okay, right?

265
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,360
Yes.

266
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,840
Na Hui says she's okay.

267
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,540
Let's go.

268
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:12,280
Hyeon Ho, you should help her.

269
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,080
Are you really okay?

270
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,210
Yes, I'm okay.

271
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,110
Let's get going, guys.

272
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:40,600
This isn't turning on.

273
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,440
This is Ju Won's, right? This won't turn on, either.

274
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,940
Let me check it out. Could you give it to me?

275
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,210
Sure. Give it back when you're done.

276
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,060
But it doesn't feel very cold in here.

277
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,310
Well, the temperature...

278
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,430
What are you supposed to set it to?

279
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,290
It's minus one degrees Celsius right now.

280
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:25,570
We probably need to lower it. Maybe minus 10.

281
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,560
Are your phones doing that, too, by the way?

282
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,000
What do you mean?

283
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,880
I didn't even charge it yesterday, but it's staying at 56 percent.

284
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,910
It seems like the battery isn't running out.

285
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,490
Oh? Mine was like that, too.

286
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,300
Mine, too.

287
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,350
What's the deal?

288
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,250
   

289
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,840
 Yun Seo. 

290
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,580
Where are you going?

291
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:20,750
Just one second. I need to go to the restroom.

292
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,610
What took you so long?

293
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,910
Did you fall asleep in the restroom?

294
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:26,800
I just had to do something.

295
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:35,110
Gosh, seriously.

296
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,760
Why isn't it working? 
    

297
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,710
What's wrong?

298
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:44,100
I tried to get the code information through the back end, but it's not working.

299
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,510
I can't figure out the source.

300
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,250
And...

301
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:52,460
I couldn't even check these because they won't turn on.

302
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,560
- Neither of them? 
 - Yes.

303
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,670
They won't charge, either. They're totally dead.

304
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:02,480
Maybe if you die, your phone won't work, either.

305
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:12,260
Have you noticed anything strange since you got here?

306
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:16,540
This, the game, and everything is strange.

307
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:19,230
No, not stuff like that.

308
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,310
Then what?

309
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,750
Actually...

310
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:28,580
I saw something in the pool yesterday.

311
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:33,740
And I saw it again in the basement earlier.

312
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,670
What did you see?

313
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,520
You know, Yul...

314
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:49,700
said there's a ghost here, right?

315
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:54,150
I wonder if that's what I saw.

316
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:58,830
What? What do you mean, a ghost? You must've been mistaken.

317
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,210
Right.

318
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,240
The line, the line, the line! The line.

319
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,370
Shit. 
    

320
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,380
It's blocked.

321
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,100
Jun Hui, there is another one there.

322
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,970
Let me try going that way.

323
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,140
What?

324
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,820
Wait here for a second.

325
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,610
Kim Dong Hyeon!

326
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,220
Dong Hyeon. 
    

327
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,910
Kim Dong Hyeon!

328
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,290
It's blocked.

329
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,100
There's no path.

330
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,800
Hey, hey.

331
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,510
Hey! Hey! There's a person! A person!

332
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:25,060
It doesn't seem blocked there, does it?

333
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,200
Here.

334
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,040
Over there, over there. Straight ahead.

335
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,810
Over there.

336
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,920
Hello! Hello! There are people here!

337
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,860
- There are people here! 
 - Hello!

338
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,350
- Hello! 
 - Hello!

339
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,240
There are people here!

340
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,290
I don't think there's a line.

341
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:00,200
 - Hello! 
 - There are people here! 

342
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,330
- Hey. 
 - There are people here!

343
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:06,040
Hold on, hold on. This is kind of strange.

344
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,480
What's wrong?

345
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,180
Look at this.

346
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,130
This person's pose hasn't changed.

347
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,660
What?

348
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,410
- His pose hasn't changed. 
 - Over here!

349
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,640
He's not moving his arm.

350
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,190
And...

351
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,000
look at the seagulls.

352
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,180
They're just floating there.

353
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,090
No, this is wrong.

354
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,460
No, I need to leave.

355
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,910
Have a look.

356
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,110
Is there a line or not?

357
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,290
Is it not there?

358
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,820
I don't think it is.

359
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,070
Look carefully!

360
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:02,630
Shit. I think we can just go.

361
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:05,430
Hey! Hey!

362
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,160
Hey, hey!

363
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:14,600
 The game has to be played within the designated area. 

364
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:24,900
 Kim Dong Hyeon is being executed for breaking the rule. 

365
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,390
No!

366
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,280
Dong Hyeon!

367
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,840
Dong Hyeon, what's wrong?

368
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,830
- Dong Hyeon, did you– 
 - Grab him, you bastard.

369
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:42,920
- Dong Hyeon! 
 - Grab him, you bastard!

370
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:47,070
Dong Hyeon! Dong Hyeon! Come here!

371
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:51,830
- Dong Hyeon! 
 - Come back! Come back!

372
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,650
Dong Hyeon.

373
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:56,070


374
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:10,600
   

375
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:17,190
   

376
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:19,570
