1
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:12,789
(Lee Jae In, Kim Woo Seok, Choi Ye Bin)

2
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,829
(Cha Woo Min, An Ji Ho, Jung So Ri)

3
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:31,340
(Night Has Come)

4
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,579
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

5
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,650
(in this drama are fictitious.)

6
00:01:04,279 --> 00:01:06,249
(Cha Yu Jun is a Doctor.)

7
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,749
What's this?

8
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,450
- I'm a Citizen. What about you? - I'm...

9
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:13,289
(You can select 1 participant and use your Heal Skill.)

10
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,790
(The selected participant will be protected from Mafia's attack.)

11
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,929
Oh, no.

12
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,358
(Will you use it on Cha Yu Jun? Yes)

13
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,359
(Heal Skill used on Cha Yu Jun.)

14
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:28,028
Ji Soo.

15
00:01:28,029 --> 00:01:29,498
(The selected participant will be protected from Mafia's attack.)

16
00:01:29,499 --> 00:01:30,969
(You can revive someone who was voted for and executed.)

17
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,639
No.

18
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:39,510
(Will you use it on Park Ji Soo? Yes)

19
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:41,409
(48 hours have not yet passed since you last used Heal.)

20
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:42,719
(Adhere to the cooling time.)

21
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:43,919
What's this?

22
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,120
Ji Soo.

23
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,719
Ji Soo.

24
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,559
I don't want to die.

25
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,329
You won't die.

26
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,730
I'll never let you die.

27
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:02,169
We should go home.

28
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:04,369
Don't you want to go home?

29
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:07,739
I do.

30
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,510
It's me.

31
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,310
I'm Mafia.

32
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,750
It's not you.

33
00:02:14,179 --> 00:02:15,579
It's really not you.

34
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:17,849
Don't.

35
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,118
It's not him. Don't do it.

36
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:21,149
(Heal Skill used on Kim Jun Hee.)

37
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:22,419
Hey.

38
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,489
Take it back. Say you're not Mafia.

39
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,579
Did you find the photo album?

40
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,049
It's not on the first floor.

41
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,750
No.

42
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,450
I swear it was here.

43
00:02:54,649 --> 00:02:57,089
It must be somewhere. Let's keep looking.

44
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,858
Cha Yu Jun...

45
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:06,898
- has died. - Yu Jun?

46
00:03:06,899 --> 00:03:09,199
- Cha Yu Jun was... - Why?

47
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,669
the Doctor.

48
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,638
All participants,

49
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:16,839
identify the Mafia and begin to vote.

50
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:23,179
He didn't break any rules.

51
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,850
So why did he...

52
00:03:27,649 --> 00:03:28,820
Did he fall?

53
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,989
He didn't fall.

54
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,260
Someone killed him.

55
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,200
There are lots of signs of a struggle,

56
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,760
and there are wounds on his head.

57
00:03:39,899 --> 00:03:41,399
Someone attacked him.

58
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,500
I bet it was the Mafia.

59
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,639
I don't know.

60
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,070
Even if it was, this is wrong.

61
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,079
How could they kill during the day?

62
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,079
What will you do now?

63
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,380
Find out who did it.

64
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,519
Why do you think Yu Jun was here?

65
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,260
Yoon Seo.

66
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,880
The Mafia has gone insane.

67
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:34,479
They're killing during the day now?

68
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:37,750
Even if Yu Jun was the Doctor,

69
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,389
this is too much.

70
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:44,659
Let's just catch the darn Mafia.

71
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,659
Who on earth is it? Darn it.

72
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,870
- Hey, guys. - What?

73
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,079
- Come over here. - What the heck for?

74
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,209
What's this?

75
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,250
What is it?

76
00:06:09,251 --> 00:06:12,079
(Jun Hee is Mafia. Da Bum is Mafia. From Police)

77
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,920
Jun Hee...

78
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,690
and you are Mafia?

79
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,659
No. I'm really not Mafia.

80
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,559
Guys, I'm not Mafia. I'm a Citizen.

81
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,070
Who wrote this and why? It's really not me.

82
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,269
Police used their Skill twice.

83
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:30,469
I think two people makes sense.

84
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:34,240
But earlier it said Jun Hee was a Citizen.

85
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,010
I'm not Mafia either.

86
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,880
Don't lie.

87
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:46,649
I bet the Police wrote this because the last one was a lie.

88
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,888
Yes. The real Police would name the Mafia.

89
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:51,389
Why would they name a Citizen?

90
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,930
No.

91
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:55,829
This could be fake.

92
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:58,760
It's weird how it appeared right after Yu Jun died.

93
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:00,669
The person who killed him...

94
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,940
could've written this to frame them as Mafia.

95
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,170
You guys. Why did you get here so late?

96
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:10,179
Didn't you write this?

97
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,639
If so, Yoon Seo wouldn't have said what she just did.

98
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,079
What the heck is this anyway?

99
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,279
(Jun Hee is a Citizen. From Police)

100
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,219
Police.

101
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:27,360
Quit this crap and show yourself.

102
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,870
Show your phones. Let's see your Skills.

103
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:37,870
There's no need to do that.

104
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:40,240
The person who killed Yu Jun.

105
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:43,740
I think I know who it is.

106
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,680
You said you'd tell us who did it.

107
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,479
Why did you bring us here?

108
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,950
In the warehouse...

109
00:07:57,389 --> 00:07:58,990
I found a footprint.

110
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:03,029
And this was next to it.

111
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,529
I think it's from the shoe of Yu Jun's killer.

112
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,750
This is the same one.

113
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,020
It stood out because I found it weird there was a blank.

114
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,890
I think this explains it.

115
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:37,329
This is an accessory lots of basketball shoes have.

116
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,629
Basketball shoes?

117
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,270
Why? What?

118
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:56,719
Is this yours?

119
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,949
Why would you say that, you witch?

120
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,650
Show us your shoes so we can check.

121
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,160
I don't use that, okay?

122
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:04,820
Let's see and find out.

123
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:13,700
Screw it. Take a look then.

124
00:09:17,469 --> 00:09:18,499
It's not his.

125
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:20,910
I told you so.

126
00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:24,180
What?

127
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,478
It's really not me. Why the heck do you suspect me?

128
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:30,780
If you're innocent, show us, then.

129
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,718
- Yes, let's see. - No. It's not me.

130
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:35,690
Screw you guys. It's not me.

131
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:37,989
Will you stop it?

132
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:45,430
Darn you.

133
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:51,940
Who bit you?

134
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,379
It really was you.

135
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,749
Why did you do it?

136
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:05,378
It wasn't me. I didn't kill him.

137
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:08,119
We found the weapons you used. Don't try to lie.

138
00:10:09,719 --> 00:10:10,790
Darn it.

139
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,089
Shall I tell the truth?

140
00:10:13,859 --> 00:10:16,429
Ko Kyung Jun killed him. It wasn't me!

141
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,598
What are you saying, psycho?

142
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:19,599
The shoe and brick says it's you!

143
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,030
How do you know that?

144
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:26,170
We never mentioned a brick. How did you know about it?

145
00:10:27,469 --> 00:10:28,509
What?

146
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:31,810
Jin Ha was with someone else in the warehouse.

147
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:36,280
We found another identical footprint but without the heel pad.

148
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:39,420
It was you, wasn't it?

149
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:41,550
Ko Kyung Jun.

150
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,060
Guys. It really wasn't me.

151
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,030
He killed Yu Jun.

152
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:49,129
He killed Seung Bin too.

153
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:51,429
You have the effing ax too.

154
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,770
You lunatic. Darn you.

155
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:56,498
- Screw you. - Hey!

156
00:10:56,499 --> 00:10:58,169
- Darn you. - Stop it!

157
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,508
- Will you stop! - Get your hands off me!

158
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:02,269
You killed him, you dirtbag.

159
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,739
Let go. I said let go of me.

160
00:11:08,849 --> 00:11:09,949
Kyung Jun!

161
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,118
Will you all get off me?

162
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:13,390
You lunatic!

163
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:23,930
Hey.

164
00:11:23,931 --> 00:11:27,269
Let go. Stay away from me.

165
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,430
You scumbag!

166
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,409
Jun Hee!

167
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,338
Come at me! I'll take you on!

168
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:39,848
Get off me! Come and get me, you!

169
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:41,009
Darn you!

170
00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:47,690
I'm cool.

171
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,530
Hey.

172
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,160
What's that?

173
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,270
What a mess.

174
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:14,050
Did you write it with this?

175
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,650
And you still say he's not Mafia?

176
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,550
When he wrote the sign?

177
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,290
What's this? Did you name them as Mafia?

178
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:25,420
No. I didn't write that sign.

179
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,229
Hey. Guys, wait.

180
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,499
Wait. Don't do anything.

181
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,498
I don't know what's going on!

182
00:12:35,499 --> 00:12:37,598
- Honestly. - We have the answer.

183
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:38,968
Vote already.

184
00:12:38,969 --> 00:12:41,339
Hey, Jun Hee. It wasn't me.

185
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,810
You're class president!

186
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,239
I don't know what's happening.

187
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,320
Hey, wait. Please, Jung Won. Don't.

188
00:12:52,349 --> 00:12:53,549
What a joke.

189
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,149
I'm innocent.

190
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,919
He's a hundred percent Mafia! Let's vote and be done with it!

191
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,119
Will you stop it?

192
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:03,160
You killed Yu Jun too.

193
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,499
We'll vote at 11pm.

194
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,070
You two should wait in a room.

195
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,579
Don't leave the room.

196
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,719
This is an effing prison cell.

197
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,729
What?

198
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:36,160
- Hand over the keys. - Why?

199
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,359
What if you get out?

200
00:13:39,099 --> 00:13:41,129
How are we to know you won't kill again?

201
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,669
We'll all use the cafeteria now. Hand over the keys.

202
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,170
They're gone. I lost them.

203
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,378
Don't lie. Hand them over already.

204
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:53,040
I don't have them, okay?

205
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:59,249
Then give me your phone. I'll keep that as collateral.

206
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,589
You can't go anywhere without your phone.

207
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:08,189
You murdered someone.

208
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,589
It's the least you can do to make us trust you.

209
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,598
What the heck, Da Bum?

210
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:21,040
You'll get it back at voting time.

211
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,790
Guys.

212
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,300
I really am not Mafia.

213
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,329
I didn't kill Seung Bin.

214
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,700
Don't vote for me, okay?

215
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,640
I really am not Mafia.

216
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:01,650
I'm a Citizen.

217
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,820
I must live if you're to live.

218
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,498
This is the men's room.

219
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,629
I know that.

220
00:15:20,369 --> 00:15:22,498
- What? - Where do you think...

221
00:15:22,499 --> 00:15:23,800
is the safest place here?

222
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:27,209
What do you mean?

223
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:28,540
Speak up.

224
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,180
Where is it?

225
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:31,909
I don't know.

226
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,450
What a moron.

227
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,280
It's the cafeteria.

228
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,180
- The cafeteria? - Yes.

229
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:39,719
No ax can get through the shutters.

230
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,420
So what?

231
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,190
What do you mean "so what?"

232
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:47,629
Kyung Jun's keys. Let's take them from him.

233
00:15:50,859 --> 00:15:52,129
We'll let you in.

234
00:15:52,859 --> 00:15:54,030
Join us.

235
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,979
- Did it hurt? - I'm fine.

236
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,160
- Are you okay? - Yes.

237
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,969
Thanks.

238
00:16:29,229 --> 00:16:30,700
If you're done, let's go.

239
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,640
They'll suspect us of being late again.

240
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:35,739
Okay.

241
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,579
Yes. Let's go.

242
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:39,910
Let's go.

243
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,820
(Povidone)

244
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,560
(From Police)

245
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,729
(Kim Jun Hee is Mafia. Jin Da Bum is Mafia. From Police)

246
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:03,499
Now we really have to vote.

247
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,969
What do you want to do?

248
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,950
Anyway,

249
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,380
Kyung Jun seems to be a Citizen.

250
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:20,920
But we don't know about Jin Ha yet.

251
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:23,090
Then...

252
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,459
it's right to save Kyung Jun.

253
00:17:26,489 --> 00:17:28,259
But Kyung Jun is weird too.

254
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,660
Why did he kill the Doctor if he were a Citizen?

255
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:34,830
Right.

256
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,039
He had an axe too.

257
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,440
Are you stupid?

258
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,380
He had the key. Why would he break the door?

259
00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:47,180
Do you have a hole in your head?

260
00:17:47,749 --> 00:17:50,380
He must've broken it not to be suspected.

261
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,880
You dumbhead know nothing.

262
00:17:54,749 --> 00:17:55,789
No.

263
00:17:56,989 --> 00:17:58,289
Jin Ha is weirder.

264
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,729
He wrote the others' names as if he were a Police.

265
00:18:02,489 --> 00:18:03,499
I know.

266
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:06,360
Jin Ha often borrowed money from Ju Won...

267
00:18:07,229 --> 00:18:09,100
to buy lottery tickets too.

268
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:12,469
He might've killed him because he didn't want to pay him back.

269
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:13,840
That must be the reason.

270
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,479
Yoon Seo.

271
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:22,580
Who do you think is the Mafia?

272
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,090
Actually, something is bothering me.

273
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,120
What is it?

274
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:34,989
When the Mafia kills someone, it says they're "executed."

275
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,160
But why did it say Yu Jun has "died?"

276
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:41,430
It's probably because he died in the daytime.

277
00:18:43,469 --> 00:18:44,469
But what if...

278
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,940
both Jin Ha and Kyung Jun are Citizens?

279
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,110
What are you going to do then?

280
00:18:50,979 --> 00:18:52,779
Why do you make it so complicated?

281
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,350
The two killed Yu Jun together.

282
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,620
Just...

283
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,120
tell them not to vote.

284
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,620
No.

285
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:05,689
If we kill everyone like that,

286
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,229
we're no different from them.

287
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:10,229
Yes. Stop saying nonsense.

288
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,100
The Police should use their Skill.

289
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,170
Then out of the two, we can save the one who is a Citizen.

290
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,870
Right.

291
00:19:19,969 --> 00:19:21,039
That's a safe way to do it.

292
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,039
No.

293
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,209
After the Doctor died,

294
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,680
the Police would be under even bigger pressure now.

295
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,279
Don't force them.

296
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,349
There is that message too.

297
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:36,249
That's why it became more complicated.

298
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:37,759
That's enough.

299
00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:43,459
Let's decide who to vote for first.

300
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,630
Then all of us...

301
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,489
agree with it,

302
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,430
right?

303
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:20,769
But...

304
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:23,840
what do we do about this?

305
00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:26,069
We should bring it to them.

306
00:20:28,969 --> 00:20:30,640
We should tell them about the result of the voting as well.

307
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,180
Then...

308
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:37,120
who should go?

309
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,350
Are we all going?

310
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:42,920
I'll go.

311
00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:45,860
You guys should hide after voting.

312
00:20:46,489 --> 00:20:47,559
When everyone is hiding,

313
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,459
I'll give the phones to them.

314
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:53,160
I'll go with you.

315
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,840
We should give these to each of them.

316
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,469
Take it.

317
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:43,549
Ko Kyung Jun, you scumbag.

318
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,019
(Will you vote for Ko Kyung Jun?)

319
00:21:47,249 --> 00:21:48,819
(Kim Jin Ha voted for Ko Kyung Jun.)

320
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:54,830
How about you?

321
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,860
Did you vote?

322
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:16,450
Please.

323
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:19,248
(Jun Hee, So Mi, Mi Na, Eun Chan, Yeon Woo, Jung Won, Da Bum,)

324
00:22:19,249 --> 00:22:20,920
(Na Hee, Yoon Seo voted for Jin Ha. Jin Ha voted for Kyung Jun.)

325
00:22:22,989 --> 00:22:24,259
Please.

326
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,660
Jun Hee.

327
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:27,830
Jun Hee.

328
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,390
I...

329
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,959
I'm really not.

330
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,329
I'm really a Citizen.

331
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,969
Please save me just once.

332
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:39,469
I really don't want to die.

333
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,140
- Jun Hee, please. - Jin Ha.

334
00:22:48,009 --> 00:22:50,180
Yu Jun must've wanted to live too.

335
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,080
Please.

336
00:23:34,729 --> 00:23:35,759
(Kim Jun Hee)

337
00:23:39,529 --> 00:23:40,829
(Kim Jun Hee is Mafia. Jin Da Bum is Mafia. From Police)

338
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,400
(From Police)

339
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:44,969
This is why you should've gotten insurance.

340
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:47,039
What did you say?

341
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,469
Never mind.

342
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,680
Tell them to bring my phone.

343
00:24:00,749 --> 00:24:01,850
We didn't bring your phone.

344
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:05,160
Tell us where the keys are.

345
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:07,059
I'll give it to you then.

346
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,989
You scumbag. Have you lost your mind?

347
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,029
You will never find it by yourself.

348
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:17,100
You know what happens when you can't vote.

349
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,039
Where are the keys?

350
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,410
Da Bum, you've grown a lot.

351
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,110
Right?

352
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,309
You know how to threaten me now.

353
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,819
Follow me. We don't have time.

354
00:24:44,529 --> 00:24:45,559
Go.

355
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:53,269
What? It's not here.

356
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,650
Are you happy now?

357
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,489
Give me my phone now.

358
00:25:14,729 --> 00:25:16,930
You should've told me you needed the keys.

359
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:18,930
You scared me for no reason.

360
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:21,870
Where is it?

361
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:25,799
Over there.

362
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,239
You bring it.

363
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,309
How would I know if it's real or not?

364
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,548
Do whatever you want. I'm leaving.

365
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:40,519
I told you to bring it, you scumbag.

366
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:45,390
We don't have time. Will you be okay?

367
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:50,959
Darn it.

368
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,840
Is it fun? You piece of trash.

369
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:08,350
Hey. Open it.

370
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,179
