(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

(Lee Yoon Seo)

9
00:01:16,503 --> 00:01:20,572
(Day One)

10
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:49,672
Where are you going?

11
00:01:53,103 --> 00:01:54,202
The restroom.

12
00:02:06,152 --> 00:02:07,182
So...

13
00:02:07,882 --> 00:02:10,592
Someone will come to the retreat center in the morning, right?

14
00:02:10,852 --> 00:02:12,092
If no one comes for us,

15
00:02:13,122 --> 00:02:14,122
let's just leave.

16
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:19,562
(You must follow the rules of Mafia.)

17
00:02:19,662 --> 00:02:22,002
(If you don't execute one of the players until 6am,)

18
00:02:22,162 --> 00:02:23,972
(one of you will be executed instead.)

19
00:02:28,243 --> 00:02:29,312
Oh, no.

20
00:02:31,173 --> 00:02:32,342
It's 6am now.

21
00:02:49,092 --> 00:02:51,062
Hey, what are you doing?

22
00:02:56,573 --> 00:02:57,573
Hey.

23
00:03:00,773 --> 00:03:02,673
Hey! What are you doing?

24
00:03:04,442 --> 00:03:05,743
Hey, stop that!

25
00:03:22,363 --> 00:03:25,333
If we don't kill anyone, we'll be the ones who die.

26
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,472
Oh, no.

27
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:31,832
- Let's hurry up and go. - Jun Hee.

28
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,042
Just a second.

29
00:03:34,043 --> 00:03:36,212
- Wait. No! - Hey!

30
00:03:36,213 --> 00:03:37,573
Let go of me.

31
00:03:40,613 --> 00:03:42,652
No.

32
00:03:48,023 --> 00:03:49,152
It's your fault.

33
00:03:51,293 --> 00:03:52,562
This is all your fault.

34
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,742
You must follow the rules of Mafia.

35
00:04:12,982 --> 00:04:14,911
You must hold a meeting...

36
00:04:14,912 --> 00:04:18,883
to come to a unanimous decision on the player you will execute.

37
00:04:20,282 --> 00:04:21,752
(You must follow the rules of Mafia.)

38
00:04:21,753 --> 00:04:23,122
(You must hold a meeting...)

39
00:04:23,123 --> 00:04:24,592
(to come to a unanimous decision on the player you will execute.)

40
00:04:29,463 --> 00:04:30,862
(Lee Yoon Seo)

41
00:05:52,943 --> 00:05:54,443
I should have at least told him.

42
00:06:00,383 --> 00:06:01,583
That I had feelings for him.

43
00:06:06,693 --> 00:06:07,823
That I really...

44
00:06:08,563 --> 00:06:09,893
liked him.

45
00:06:19,443 --> 00:06:21,041
Before the last vote closed,

46
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:24,512
the Doctor nominated whom to Heal.

47
00:06:24,513 --> 00:06:27,443
The nominated player was Kim Jun Hee.

48
00:06:28,683 --> 00:06:30,851
Thanks to Doctor's ability to Heal,

49
00:06:30,852 --> 00:06:33,883
Kim Jun Hee has been brought back to life.

50
00:07:00,612 --> 00:07:01,943
Are you okay?

51
00:07:16,063 --> 00:07:17,092
What a relief.

52
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,232
I'm so relieved.

53
00:07:24,602 --> 00:07:26,373
I was really scared.

54
00:07:30,912 --> 00:07:34,412
I'm so relieved you're back.

55
00:07:39,552 --> 00:07:42,052
Gosh. How does this make sense? The class president came back?

56
00:07:43,052 --> 00:07:44,453
Even a Doctor...

57
00:07:44,823 --> 00:07:45,852
Hey.

58
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:52,662
Kim Jin Ha?

59
00:07:57,802 --> 00:08:00,471
During the night, Shin Seung Bin...

60
00:08:00,472 --> 00:08:02,372
was executed by the Mafia.

61
00:08:02,373 --> 00:08:06,111
- Hey. Kim Jin Ha! - Shin Seung Bin was...

62
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:07,282
a Citizen.

63
00:08:07,943 --> 00:08:09,713
Morning has come.

64
00:08:10,112 --> 00:08:12,551
- You startled me. - What's going on?

65
00:08:12,552 --> 00:08:14,582
- Why did you take off your shirt? - Identify the Mafia...

66
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:15,583
and begin to vote.

67
00:08:15,584 --> 00:08:16,792
Where did the blood come from?

68
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:18,792
Whose blood is it?

69
00:08:26,362 --> 00:08:27,903
It's nothing.

70
00:08:29,602 --> 00:08:30,602
What's going on?

71
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,471
What was that? Wasn't that blood?

72
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:36,673
I'm certain it was blood. Right?

73
00:08:38,443 --> 00:08:39,842
- What's going on? - It was blood.

74
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,252
Jun Hee!

75
00:08:54,193 --> 00:08:56,333
I was so scared that you were really dead.

76
00:08:57,563 --> 00:08:59,731
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

77
00:08:59,732 --> 00:09:00,762
I'm okay.

78
00:09:03,102 --> 00:09:04,703
- Let's go. - Wait.

79
00:09:06,102 --> 00:09:08,502
Did you see the photo from yesterday?

80
00:09:09,043 --> 00:09:10,342
The photo Yoon Seo had.

81
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,371
What?

82
00:09:12,372 --> 00:09:14,443
You threw it out here yesterday, right?

83
00:09:17,153 --> 00:09:18,413
She's driving me crazy.

84
00:09:19,213 --> 00:09:20,953
Do you still believe her?

85
00:09:21,252 --> 00:09:24,392
You died because of her. Get a grip!

86
00:09:26,592 --> 00:09:28,892
- Kim So Mi. - You know I'm right.

87
00:09:29,063 --> 00:09:30,262
Am I wrong?

88
00:09:42,403 --> 00:09:43,772
Goodness!

89
00:10:08,102 --> 00:10:09,102
Hey!

90
00:10:11,573 --> 00:10:12,673
Did you kill him?

91
00:10:15,673 --> 00:10:18,612
It wasn't me. I didn't kill him!

92
00:10:19,112 --> 00:10:22,083
When I woke up this morning, that's how I found him.

93
00:10:25,382 --> 00:10:26,482
It wasn't me.

94
00:10:27,122 --> 00:10:28,722
Guys, it really wasn't me.

95
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,293
Hey, Yoon Seo.

96
00:11:46,563 --> 00:11:48,232
The three of them were inseparable.

97
00:11:51,472 --> 00:11:52,972
Talk about some loyal friends.

98
00:11:56,342 --> 00:11:58,543
Let's go. The smell of the blood makes me want to puke.

99
00:12:00,612 --> 00:12:01,913
Seung Bin...

100
00:12:03,382 --> 00:12:05,183
was stabbed a lot of times by a knife.

101
00:12:06,522 --> 00:12:08,053
Why take things that far?

102
00:12:08,423 --> 00:12:10,923
Don't talk about that. No one wants to know.

103
00:12:11,153 --> 00:12:12,293
This is morbid.

104
00:12:14,022 --> 00:12:16,222
I think he was stabbed even after he had died.

105
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:22,333
The Mafia didn't take things far with the other kids.

106
00:12:24,002 --> 00:12:25,433
But this time,

107
00:12:27,502 --> 00:12:29,713
I get the feeling the Mafia really wanted him dead.

108
00:12:37,752 --> 00:12:39,782
Seung Bin was dead in a pool of blood.

109
00:12:39,783 --> 00:12:41,522
Then my body was covered in blood.

110
00:12:41,852 --> 00:12:43,522
I was so shocked.

111
00:12:47,663 --> 00:12:48,762
It really wasn't you?

112
00:12:49,762 --> 00:12:51,193
No!

113
00:12:57,673 --> 00:13:01,543
It looked like they were suspecting me, right?

114
00:13:03,142 --> 00:13:04,173
Yes.

115
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,641
Darn it. Come on, Seung Bin. That jerk.

116
00:13:06,642 --> 00:13:08,482
Why did he have to die when he was with me?

117
00:13:13,522 --> 00:13:14,553
Kyung Jun.

118
00:13:15,122 --> 00:13:18,923
Can you tell them that I'm not the Mafia? Please?

119
00:13:19,522 --> 00:13:21,063
They listen to you.

120
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,492
You said we should have each other's back.

121
00:13:29,232 --> 00:13:30,232
Okay.

122
00:13:32,132 --> 00:13:35,173
Thank you, Kyung Jun. I'll really be good to you.

123
00:13:42,443 --> 00:13:44,183
(Jun Hee is a Citizen. From Police)

124
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,022
Hey, did you write that down?

125
00:13:49,683 --> 00:13:50,793
It wasn't me.

126
00:13:51,823 --> 00:13:52,852
What's this?

127
00:13:53,323 --> 00:13:54,992
Did the Police really write this?

128
00:13:55,762 --> 00:13:57,132
It wasn't here yesterday, right?

129
00:13:57,663 --> 00:13:59,663
No. I don't remember seeing it.

130
00:14:04,203 --> 00:14:06,771
(Police)

131
00:14:06,772 --> 00:14:08,803
- It wasn't me. - Who wrote that?

132
00:14:09,043 --> 00:14:10,572
Who on earth are the Police?

133
00:14:10,573 --> 00:14:12,713
- Is it you? - You think?

134
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:19,783
I had no choice but to lie yesterday.

135
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,251
I'm a Citizen.

136
00:14:22,252 --> 00:14:23,823
I don't know who the Doctor is.

137
00:14:26,252 --> 00:14:27,262
Thank you.

138
00:14:28,122 --> 00:14:31,193
Hey, you coming back to life is a separate matter.

139
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,833
We can't be sure if you're a Citizen or not.

140
00:14:34,903 --> 00:14:35,933
Right.

141
00:14:36,632 --> 00:14:38,803
How come his identity wasn't revealed yesterday?

142
00:14:40,872 --> 00:14:42,803
The identities are usually revealed when they die.

143
00:14:44,012 --> 00:14:46,372
It wasn't revealed because he wasn't out of the game.

144
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,352
It really wasn't you who wrote the message on the wall?

145
00:14:51,713 --> 00:14:53,083
I didn't.

146
00:14:53,982 --> 00:14:55,351
It's not like I had time to write that.

147
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,252
You probably wrote that in the middle of the night.

148
00:14:58,053 --> 00:14:59,122
Hey.

149
00:14:59,352 --> 00:15:02,122
Why would he lie to us that he was the Mafia unless he was crazy?

150
00:15:02,592 --> 00:15:03,732
Let's just vote him out.

151
00:15:04,592 --> 00:15:07,132
Hey, he's a Citizen.

152
00:15:07,463 --> 00:15:09,632
What would you do if the Police really wrote that?

153
00:15:09,732 --> 00:15:10,772
Right.

154
00:15:11,002 --> 00:15:14,102
The Doctor might have saved Jun Hee, knowing he was a Citizen.

155
00:15:14,403 --> 00:15:15,703
Isn't finding the person...

156
00:15:16,742 --> 00:15:18,713
who killed Seung Bin a more pressing matter...

157
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,713
than interrogating Jun Hee?

158
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,583
It wasn't me.

159
00:15:30,423 --> 00:15:32,423
When I woke up, I found him dead.

160
00:15:33,153 --> 00:15:34,892
You said it was just you and him. Right?

161
00:15:35,063 --> 00:15:36,262
Did you see anything unusual?

162
00:15:37,663 --> 00:15:38,663
I don't know.

163
00:15:40,563 --> 00:15:44,033
The Mafia put blood on me on purpose when I was asleep.

164
00:15:46,303 --> 00:15:47,472
Right, Kyung Jun?

165
00:15:48,472 --> 00:15:50,943
You know that I'm a Citizen. Right?

166
00:15:56,612 --> 00:15:57,813
How would I know that?

167
00:15:58,382 --> 00:15:59,382
What?

168
00:15:59,553 --> 00:16:02,522
You came out, covered in blood. That's evidence.

169
00:16:03,222 --> 00:16:06,052
Seung Bin kept picking on you.

170
00:16:06,053 --> 00:16:07,293
You got angry. Isn't that why you did it?

171
00:16:11,693 --> 00:16:14,463
Hey, you're suspecting Jin Ha too.

172
00:16:14,762 --> 00:16:15,862
Let's just vote him out.

173
00:16:17,632 --> 00:16:20,403
How could you call yourself a friend, you jerk?

174
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:26,172
You darn Mafia. You must have a death wish.

175
00:16:26,173 --> 00:16:29,112
You scumbag.

176
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,553
- Hey. - Move! Darn it.

177
00:16:31,913 --> 00:16:33,152
Vote him out now!

178
00:16:33,153 --> 00:16:35,653
Hey. You don't know that for sure.

179
00:16:35,852 --> 00:16:37,852
Shut your mouth, and just do it.

180
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:44,433
Give it back.

181
00:16:45,063 --> 00:16:46,833
You'll keep doing whatever you want?

182
00:16:47,063 --> 00:16:48,732
Darn you. Just give back my phone.

183
00:16:50,703 --> 00:16:52,403
If you keep this up,

184
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,403
you might end up getting all the votes.

185
00:17:04,353 --> 00:17:05,913
Let's reconvene at 11pm.

186
00:17:06,722 --> 00:17:08,082
Let's not vote until then.

187
00:17:23,472 --> 00:17:24,673
- Are you okay? - Yes.

188
00:17:33,012 --> 00:17:34,143
Kim So Mi.

189
00:17:40,423 --> 00:17:41,522
Can we talk?

190
00:17:49,992 --> 00:17:51,062
Guys.

191
00:17:56,163 --> 00:17:58,732
It really wasn't me. Don't vote me out.

192
00:17:59,772 --> 00:18:02,173
I'll find out who killed Seung Bin.

193
00:18:02,742 --> 00:18:03,972
You just wait.

194
00:18:14,822 --> 00:18:16,522
Do you think Jin Ha killed him?

195
00:18:17,552 --> 00:18:20,093
He must have known we'd suspect him because of the blood.

196
00:18:21,193 --> 00:18:22,463
He has no reason to do that.

197
00:18:23,193 --> 00:18:24,193
Exactly.

198
00:18:24,732 --> 00:18:27,463
Then he should've told us. Why would he run away?

199
00:18:28,302 --> 00:18:29,363
That makes him look suspicious.

200
00:18:30,802 --> 00:18:33,002
By the way, Ko Kyung Jun is unbelievable.

201
00:18:34,203 --> 00:18:35,502
He abandoned Kim Jin Ha right away.

202
00:18:35,703 --> 00:18:36,772
Seriously...

203
00:18:36,943 --> 00:18:38,113
Those backstabbing jerks.

204
00:18:39,972 --> 00:18:42,542
Considering his actions, Ko Kyung Jun is the Mafia.

205
00:18:42,742 --> 00:18:45,382
(Jun Hee is a Citizen. From Police)

206
00:18:45,383 --> 00:18:46,383
Guys.

207
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:51,423
If the police wrote this,

208
00:18:53,052 --> 00:18:54,292
why wrote only Jun Hee?

209
00:18:55,762 --> 00:18:58,093
The skill was used twice. There must be more than one.

210
00:18:59,393 --> 00:19:01,232
Maybe it's written somewhere else.

211
00:19:02,762 --> 00:19:04,373
He should've written who the Mafia is.

212
00:19:07,403 --> 00:19:10,143
Don't frame Yoon Seo or anyone else for me.

213
00:19:10,972 --> 00:19:12,512
Jun Hee, I was only trying to save you.

214
00:19:15,082 --> 00:19:16,512
I was trying to help you.

215
00:19:18,453 --> 00:19:19,913
I never asked for your help.

216
00:19:21,482 --> 00:19:22,653
Don't blame me.

217
00:19:23,593 --> 00:19:24,893
You did it for yourself.

218
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:31,633
Kim Jun Hee.

219
00:19:34,732 --> 00:19:36,633
Don't you remember what I did for you?

220
00:19:37,832 --> 00:19:39,831
Who sided with you when you were suspected?

221
00:19:39,832 --> 00:19:40,903
It was me!

222
00:19:41,742 --> 00:19:42,772
Hey.

223
00:19:43,203 --> 00:19:44,673
Get a hold of yourself.

224
00:19:46,982 --> 00:19:49,742
Do you want me to consider you a Mafia?

225
00:19:51,582 --> 00:19:52,782
Suit yourself.

226
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:05,292
Yu Jun.

227
00:20:09,262 --> 00:20:10,502
Eat even if you don't want to.

228
00:20:11,173 --> 00:20:12,332
You haven't eaten anything.

229
00:20:24,052 --> 00:20:25,782
(Jin Da Bum)

230
00:20:27,052 --> 00:20:29,582
My laptop is in the basement.

231
00:20:30,623 --> 00:20:32,093
Oh, right.

232
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:34,363
I'll go with you.

233
00:20:39,492 --> 00:20:41,863
(Lee Yoon Seo)

234
00:21:02,982 --> 00:21:03,992
Watch.

235
00:21:04,393 --> 00:21:05,853
They didn't move.

236
00:21:06,222 --> 00:21:07,292
Isn't that strange?

237
00:21:09,463 --> 00:21:11,363
- Watch. - What's that?

238
00:21:12,262 --> 00:21:13,532
How is that possible?

239
00:21:14,433 --> 00:21:15,463
I know.

240
00:21:16,903 --> 00:21:18,203
- Let me see. - Okay.

241
00:21:36,923 --> 00:21:37,923
One sec.

242
00:21:39,492 --> 00:21:40,593
Yoon Seo.

243
00:21:44,992 --> 00:21:47,203
Dang it. Who was it?

244
00:21:56,403 --> 00:21:57,913
I didn't notice anything strange.

245
00:22:09,552 --> 00:22:11,292
When I ran yesterday,

246
00:22:14,022 --> 00:22:15,562
Hey, what about us?

247
00:22:15,923 --> 00:22:17,163
If we stay together, it's more dangerous.

248
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:18,831
Where are we supposed to go?

249
00:22:18,832 --> 00:22:20,093
Go to the arcade.

250
00:22:35,143 --> 00:22:36,312
Only Ko Kyung Jun knew...

251
00:22:38,713 --> 00:22:39,913
we were hiding in here.

252
00:22:50,123 --> 00:22:52,292
How come you didn't go with Kim Jun Hee?

253
00:22:53,262 --> 00:22:54,802
Don't talk to me about him anymore.

254
00:22:57,472 --> 00:22:59,772
Na Hee, you done eating?

255
00:23:00,302 --> 00:23:01,343
Let's go.

256
00:23:07,143 --> 00:23:09,683
So sensitive. What's her problem?

257
00:23:10,812 --> 00:23:12,552
She was fighting with Kim Jun Hee earlier.

258
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,552
Do they have issues?

259
00:23:16,282 --> 00:23:18,222
If you're done, leave.

260
00:23:18,792 --> 00:23:19,923
I haven't eaten yet.

261
00:23:23,262 --> 00:23:24,633
Don't you know a break time?

262
00:23:25,393 --> 00:23:26,593
It's closed.

263
00:23:27,262 --> 00:23:28,502
Give me a break.

264
00:23:29,363 --> 00:23:30,802
What's his deal now?

265
00:23:40,582 --> 00:23:41,782
Close the door behind you.

266
00:25:27,722 --> 00:25:30,722
(Find the game host.)

267
00:25:32,623 --> 00:25:33,693
(Find the game host.)

268
00:25:38,193 --> 00:25:39,193
Host?

269
00:27:03,242 --> 00:27:04,252
Yoon Seo.

270
00:27:10,693 --> 00:27:11,722
What are you doing?

271
00:27:12,222 --> 00:27:13,423
It's doing the same thing.

272
00:27:15,062 --> 00:27:16,123
What do you mean?

273
00:27:17,022 --> 00:27:18,032
I mean,

274
00:27:19,133 --> 00:27:21,163
when I just took pictures, it was fine.

275
00:27:21,633 --> 00:27:23,363
But only our faces look weird.

276
00:27:25,173 --> 00:27:26,772
Just like that group photo.

277
00:27:27,603 --> 00:27:28,643
What's wrong?

278
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,582
I saw a ghost earlier.

279
00:27:38,713 --> 00:27:39,812
And I found this.

280
00:27:40,413 --> 00:27:41,482
What's that key for?

281
00:27:42,123 --> 00:27:43,782
I don't know what it's for,

282
00:27:44,552 --> 00:27:46,693
but if there's a message for it, It must be something important.

283
00:27:47,762 --> 00:27:48,863
What message?

284
00:27:51,393 --> 00:27:53,093
To find a host.

285
00:27:54,103 --> 00:27:55,163
Didn't you get it?

286
00:28:01,042 --> 00:28:03,203
(No new messages)

287
00:28:03,843 --> 00:28:06,012
No, I didn't get any.

288
00:28:07,512 --> 00:28:08,512
What about you?

289
00:28:12,213 --> 00:28:13,282
Not for me.

290
00:28:14,022 --> 00:28:15,282
Me too. I didn't get any.

291
00:28:16,123 --> 00:28:17,183
What?

292
00:28:18,923 --> 00:28:19,992
Was it just me?

293
00:28:21,963 --> 00:28:23,292
What did it say? Show me.

294
00:28:24,762 --> 00:28:26,292
It disappeared.

295
00:28:27,963 --> 00:28:30,903
Anyway, there must be a reason to find a host.

296
00:28:31,203 --> 00:28:32,932
Let's tell everyone and search together.

297
00:28:32,933 --> 00:28:34,173
Do we have to tell them now?

298
00:28:37,972 --> 00:28:40,613
To be honest, I don't know what you're talking about.

299
00:28:43,413 --> 00:28:45,853
When we went to the swimming pool yesterday, we didn't find anything.

300
00:28:46,653 --> 00:28:47,923
What if you get suspected as a Mafia...

301
00:28:48,453 --> 00:28:50,252
for saying that?

302
00:28:52,292 --> 00:28:54,463
This has nothing to do with Mafia.

303
00:28:56,363 --> 00:28:57,561
I even got a message.

304
00:28:57,562 --> 00:28:58,592
You said it disappeared.

305
00:28:58,593 --> 00:29:00,262
If other people don't believe it, there's nothing you can do.

306
00:29:06,603 --> 00:29:08,472
You don't trust me either.

307
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:12,913
It's not that we don't trust you.

308
00:29:14,582 --> 00:29:15,782
That's what the situation says.

309
00:29:17,883 --> 00:29:18,913
Right.

310
00:29:19,353 --> 00:29:22,153
I was saying, we should be careful...

311
00:29:22,383 --> 00:29:24,853
until we find solid evidence.

312
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:28,893
Yoon Seo, I trust you.

313
00:29:29,762 --> 00:29:31,062
But Jung Won also has a point.

314
00:29:31,762 --> 00:29:33,792
Let's not make other people anxious...

315
00:29:34,203 --> 00:29:35,502
and keep it between us for now.

316
00:29:37,232 --> 00:29:38,302
Okay.

317
00:29:39,703 --> 00:29:42,343
Do you want me to find the album the photo was in?

318
00:30:31,193 --> 00:30:35,363

321
00:31:39,123 --> 00:31:40,552
I wondered who was following me.

322
00:31:40,822 --> 00:31:42,093
That rat was you.

323
00:31:42,322 --> 00:31:43,893
Darn jerk.

324
00:31:46,933 --> 00:31:48,062
You hid an ax.

325
00:31:50,262 --> 00:31:51,433
What's this?

326
00:31:57,173 --> 00:31:59,173
What the heck is that?

327
00:32:00,373 --> 00:32:02,082
Were you going to burn it to get rid of evidence?

328
00:32:03,312 --> 00:32:04,582
It really was you.

329
00:32:05,782 --> 00:32:07,481
You killed Shin Seung Bin!

330
00:32:07,482 --> 00:32:09,282
I was framed too!

331
00:32:10,082 --> 00:32:11,752
Framed for what?

332
00:32:12,893 --> 00:32:14,662
You tried to frame me.

333
00:32:14,663 --> 00:32:15,822
You crazy Mafia.

334
00:32:17,163 --> 00:32:18,933
Do you still call yourself a human?

335
00:32:19,532 --> 00:32:21,133
- Darn you. - Shoot.

336
00:32:23,203 --> 00:32:24,432
Let it go.

337
00:32:24,433 --> 00:32:27,072
- You jerk. - Let it go.

338
00:32:27,373 --> 00:32:28,703
You Mafia.

339
00:32:34,042 --> 00:32:35,512
You prick.

340
00:32:39,153 --> 00:32:40,812
Come here, you punk.

341

342
00:32:43,883 --> 00:32:44,953

343
00:32:47,052 --> 00:32:48,393
Let go of me, you Mafia jerks.

344
00:32:50,022 --> 00:32:51,032
Dang it.

345
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:58,972
You killed Shin Seung Bin and Ji Soo...

346
00:32:59,272 --> 00:33:01,173
You killed Ji Soo too!

347
00:33:01,502 --> 00:33:02,542
It wasn't me.

348
00:33:03,173 --> 00:33:04,203
Guys!

349

- Ko Kyung Jun and... - Be quiet!

350
00:33:07,272 --> 00:33:08,582
Stop him.

(Check for safety before work. Clean up after work.)

352
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:26,792
Shoot.

353

Why did you have to push him?

354
00:33:29,463 --> 00:33:31,433
Why didn't you hold him tight?

355
00:33:52,522 --> 00:33:53,593
Hey.

356
00:33:55,593 --> 00:33:56,693
What are you going to do?

357
00:33:58,332 --> 00:33:59,792
If he tells everyone,

358
00:34:00,693 --> 00:34:02,062
we're doomed.

359
00:34:04,102 --> 00:34:05,633
Do you think they'll buy us?

360
00:34:44,102 --> 00:34:45,213
What are you doing?

361
00:34:46,973 --> 00:34:48,013
Kill him.

362
00:34:55,582 --> 00:34:56,622
Gosh.
