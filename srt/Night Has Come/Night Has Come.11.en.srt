00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,238
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

7
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:34,669
(in this drama are fictitious.)

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,410
- I'm telling the truth! - Let's talk it out. Let go of him!

9
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:40,650
You say that after you saw his stomach?

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,779
It wasn't me!

11
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,378
Will you hear me out?

12
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:46,488
What's going on?

13
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:48,620
Why should we listen? You're Mafia.

14
00:00:48,959 --> 00:00:50,360
There's a gash on Yeon Woo's body.

15
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,160
It wasn't me.

16
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:57,429
It's not me. I swear.

17
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,140
Hey, Jin Da Bum.

18
00:01:12,649 --> 00:01:14,509
But why did you go there alone to check the camera?

19
00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:16,419
You're the Mafia, aren't you?

20
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,779
I'm not the Mafia!

21
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,488
Stop lying, Mafia jerk.

22
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:22,019
I was just checking if it was fully charged.

23
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:24,959
Why did you get hurt then?

24
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:28,190
I really don't know.

25
00:01:28,429 --> 00:01:30,258
When I woke up, I found myself like this.

26
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:31,330
That doesn't make sense.

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,030
- You're the Mafia, aren't you? - Darn it.

28
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,700
(Jin Da Bum)

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,469
Nam Yeon Woo...

30
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,410
- voted for Jin Da Bum. - What do you think you're doing?

31
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,919
- Come on. - Jin Da Bum...

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,789
- voted for Nam Yeon Woo. - Hey.

33
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,360
Yesterday too.

34
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:00,889
You two came out late this morning.

35
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:02,660
I bet those two are behind this.

36
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:05,699
So Mi, Na Hee, Kyung Jun, Woo Ram, and Ju Young.

37
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,828
They all have to do with those two.

38
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:09,999
You psycho. Why would I kill Ju Young?

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,370
Because you're the Mafia!

40
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:13,310
That's why the luminous paint only got on your shoes.

41
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,539
Then how do you explain your wound?

42
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,538
You must have put it on my shoes during the night.

43
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:19,878
- You pig! - Shut your mouth, you Mafia!

44
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:20,910
Darn it.

45
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:26,049
Darn it.

46
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,089
- Choi Mi Na voted... - You said the Mafia had a wound.

47
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,298
- Nam Yeon Woo. - Come on! Vote now!

48
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:37,960
Yes! I'm sure he's the Mafia!

49
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:40,769
Hey, you guys should vote too.

50
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,829
Shut your mouth.

51
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,470
Are you sure you went there to check if it was charged?

52
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,109
I told you to wait. Why did you go there alone?

53
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,379
Hey, you said no one was there.

54
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:52,449
I was just worried!

55
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,479
The Mafia could have gone there and tampered with it.

56
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,878
The Mafia deleted the security camera footage too.

57
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,219
There was no guarantee the Mafia wouldn't touch the camera.

58
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,449
If that's what you thought, you couldn't have gone there alone.

59
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:03,460
You would have told me because you wouldn't want to be suspected.

60
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,359
Just like the security footage, you wanted to delete the video too.

61
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,229
You didn't go there to check if the camera was charged.

62
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,858
You wanted to check if you were on camera and to delete it!

63
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,500
That's not true!

64
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,899
Hey.

65
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,340
I didn't delete it. I simply took a look at it!

66
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:19,840
You can't call me Mafia for that.

67
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,210
You were the only jerk who tried to find the camera!

68
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,378
- Lee Yoon Seo... - What are you doing?

69
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:31,179
- voted for Jin Da Bum. - I swear. It's not me.

70
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,489
I'm not the Mafia!

71
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,119
Kim Jun Hee...

72
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,090
- voted for Jin Da Bum. - Yes. Those two are the Mafia.

73
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,990
Hey, vote him out now.

74
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:42,560
Let's vote him out tonight.

75
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,729
Then let's vote her out tomorrow.

76
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:47,829
- We'll be done with this game then. - But Yeon Woo.

77
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:49,970
You...

78
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:53,139
You woke up with a wound you didn't know how you got.

79
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,870
Why did you hide it?

80
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,280
You even hid it from Im Eun Chan.

81
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,750
That's because if I told you, you would have suspected me.

82
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:06,319
You should have been honest with us.

83
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,390
Why did you complicate things?

84
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,820
Darn it. Not you too.

85
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:15,188
None of us knew that the Mafia was wounded...

86
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:16,559
in the morning.

87
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,770
It's odd that you hid it because you didn't want to be suspected.

88
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:21,999
Right.

89
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,538
He probably couldn't tell us...

90
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:24,770
because he was the Mafia and he knew he'd look guilty.

91
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,609
Hey, watch your six.

92
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,879
That jerk will kill you tonight.

93
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,479
Shut your mouth, Mafia scum!

94
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,210
- Darn you. - Hey.

95
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,949
I bet both of them are the Mafia.

96
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,749
They're just putting on a show.

97
00:04:38,179 --> 00:04:40,390
Just vote for one of them. Hurry!

98
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:51,530
Oh Jung Won voted for Nam Yeon Woo.

99
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:53,999
Hey.

100
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:56,200
You killed Na Hee, didn't you?

101
00:04:57,499 --> 00:04:58,539
Darn you.

102
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,869
- Hey. - Jung Won.

103
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,839
I'm certain it's Yeon Woo this time.

104
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,179
Look at the wound on his body.

105
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,409
Darn you!

106
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,650
- No, stop it. - Come on.

107
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:09,880
- Let go of me! - What are you doing?

108
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:18,189
Hey. Yeon Woo.

109
00:05:19,429 --> 00:05:20,890
Why won't you vote him out?

110
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,929
Why are you hesitating?

111
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:24,799
Are you suspecting me too?

112
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
It's not that.

113
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,598
You're the only one with the wound. You should explain...

114
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:31,900
Darn it. Explain what?

115
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,169
Then how about this?

116
00:05:33,609 --> 00:05:36,080
You and I were together last night. How come only I got stabbed?

117
00:05:39,549 --> 00:05:40,650
Did you stab me?

118
00:05:42,549 --> 00:05:44,780
- What? - Is that why you told the others...

119
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,220
that I went to the infirmary?

120
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,618
You Mafia jerk!

121
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:51,260
That's enough! Stop it!

122
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,999
Come on!

123
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,429
Come on. Are you serious?

124
00:05:59,929 --> 00:06:00,970
Why?

125
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:04,340
Why won't you try to find the Mafia who stabbed me?

126
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,010
Why are you doing this to me?

127
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,710
Darn it.

128
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,510
This wound hurts like crazy.

129
00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:23,260
Im Eun Chan voted for Nam Yeon Woo.

130
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,530
Why did you hide it from me then?

131
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,700
You should have told me the truth at least!

132
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:39,169
Maybe, you couldn't because you were the Mafia.

133
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:41,539
Hey.

134
00:06:46,049 --> 00:06:47,349
I expected this from the others.

135
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:50,080
But how could you suspect me?

136
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,119
How could you vote me out?

137
00:06:58,119 --> 00:07:00,260
Hey, it's not that.

138
00:07:00,489 --> 00:07:02,260
How could you vote me out?

139
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,590
Aren't you going to hide?

140
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:25,939
Hey.

141
00:08:32,819 --> 00:08:33,919
Hey, Jin Da Bum.

142
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,919
Hey!

143
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,419
Hey!

144
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:49,299
Darn it!

145
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,870
No!

146
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,770
Darn it.

147
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,110
This is...

148
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:14,429
This is so not fair.

149
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,760
Mom...

150
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,199
Let me live.

151
00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:24,039
Mom!

152
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,510
(Jun Hee is a Citizen. From Police)

153
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:37,150
(Jin Da Bum)

154
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,669
Look over here. I found something here.

155
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,438
(Oh Jung Won)

156
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:37,809
We should get going too. We don't have much time left.

157
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,679
It's that jerk, Jin Da Bum.

158
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,650
I saw him smirk earlier.

159
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:44,880
He smirked when Yeon Woo got suspected of the Mafia.

160
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,750
Everyone finished voting. There's nothing we can do.

161
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,549
We should go now.

162
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:51,719
I'll get going first then. You two should hide.

163
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,589
You won't come with us?

164
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,500
It's more dangerous if we stay together.

165
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,100
Let's hide separately today.

166
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,699
See you in the morning.

167
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,870
Yoon Seo.

168
00:11:08,469 --> 00:11:09,709
We must hide now.

169
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,039
We don't have much time.

170
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,579
Jung Won.

171
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:17,120
How...

172
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:19,990
did you know Na Hee hid up there?

173
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,089
I don't remember Jun Hee telling us that.

174
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:04,559
Hey, Jin Da Bum.

175
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:12,000
You!

176
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,339
What are you doing?

177
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,510
Why did you do it?

178
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,339
Why did you kill them? They've done nothing wrong!

179
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,279
I'm a Citizen. Why are you taking it out on me?

180
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,579
Don't give me that nonsense!

181
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,350
You killed them.

182
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,419
Why won't you believe me?

183
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,730
I'll find out once you die.

184
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Hey.

185
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:49,809
Darn it.

186
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:01,750
Come on.

187
00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:07,030
You just want to stay alive with your friends.

188
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm neither your friend nor do you care about me.

189
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,740
You don't care if I die or not. Isn't that what you think?

190
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:25,380
Look who's talking.

191
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,280
That's what you're thinking.

192
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,919
Hey. You're killing everyone so you can stay alive alone.

193
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:33,889
How are you so different from Kyung Jun?

194
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,490
Darn it. Don't bring him up!

195
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,490
What do you know?

196
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,160
Look.

197
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,530
Look at this. Darn it.

198
00:13:57,709 --> 00:13:59,280
Because of him and his crew,

199
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,949
do you know how many times I tried to kill myself?

200
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:05,120
When I was getting bullied by them,

201
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:09,120
you didn't even show any concern.

202
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,459
Darn it. What have you done for me?

203
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,458
You only acted nice in front of the class.

204
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:15,890
What have you actually fixed?

205
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:20,299
You had no real intention of helping me!

206
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,770
What right do you have to accuse me of that?

207
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,610
People like you disgust me...

208
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,110
more than Kyung Jun and his crew.

209
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:34,350
Did you know that?

210
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:49,829
If you can't kill me,

211
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,230
beg me to spare you.

212
00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:55,900
It's not my first time dying anyway.

213
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,569
But don't kill Yoon Seo or the others.

214
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:13,549
Darn it.

215
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,199
Anyone can put 2 and 2 together.

216
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,900
That was the only place anyone could have hidden.

217
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,439
There...

218
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,240
How can anyone guess she'd hide there?

219
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:42,250
She must have found a good place to hide...

220
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:44,750
because she wanted to stay alive.

221
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:47,250
Yeon Woo's wound...

222
00:15:49,219 --> 00:15:50,289
Did you do that?

223
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:53,959
Na Hee too?

224
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,900
Wait.

225
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,260
What's that?

226
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,100
And Yeon Woo too?

227
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,900
The security footage!

228
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,839
(Do you want to delete the files?)

229
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,140
If you kill Yoon Seo or Kyung Jun,

230
00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:10,980
you'll be the first ones to be suspected.

231
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,679
Then what do you want to do?

232
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,959
If we play this right, there might be a way...

233
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,289
to get rid of Ko Kyung Jun, Kim Jin Ha,

234
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,429
and Shin Seung Bin in one go.

235
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,699
Do you want to try it?

236
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:46,780
Did you kill our classmates?

237
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,549
Why...

238
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:52,620
won't you say anything?

239
00:16:55,219 --> 00:16:56,219
You didn't, right?

240
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,959
Tell me you didn't.

241
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,890
Then I'll believe you.

242
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,459
Tell me you didn't!

243
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,229
Please tell me it wasn't you!

244
00:17:14,969 --> 00:17:16,810
Why is it you?

245
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:27,689
Yes.

246
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,060
If you figured that out,

247
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:34,959
you should have run away.

248
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,590
Dang it. The keys.

249
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,360
Shoot.

250
00:18:10,499 --> 00:18:11,529
I'll kill you.

251
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:21,209
Die.

252
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:23,070
Let's die together, Mafia.

253
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:28,410
- Shoot. - I'm not the Mafia.

254
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,650
It doesn't matter.

255
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,650
You voted me out. You're a murderer.

256
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,218
Die.

257
00:18:34,219 --> 00:18:35,620
Help...

258
00:18:58,939 --> 00:19:00,679
Voting is over.

259
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:04,749
With the most votes, Nam Yeon Woo will be executed.

260
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:21,469
Nam Yeon Woo is a Citizen.

261
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:24,939
Yeon Woo...

262
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:28,540
Yeon Woo...

263
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,979
(Restricted Area)

264
00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:35,910
Don't kill them.

265
00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:39,209
Please.

266
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:43,080
I don't want to see anyone dying anymore.

267
00:20:44,949 --> 00:20:46,279
I'm tired of it.

268
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,719
I want to stop playing this game.

269
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:51,459
Please don't kill them.

270
00:21:29,459 --> 00:21:31,999
Mafia, you must follow the rules.

271
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,938
You must hold a meeting...

272
00:21:41,939 --> 00:21:44,539
to come to a unanimous decision on the player you will execute.

273
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,479
Dang it!

274
00:22:06,499 --> 00:22:07,499
Hey.

275
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,900
Why is there a camera?

276
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:11,640
Why didn't you tell me?

277
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:14,040
It just happened.

278
00:22:14,969 --> 00:22:16,809
I didn't see this coming either.

279
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:19,310
Still, you should've told me what was going on!

280
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,079
I thought I was going to die.

281
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,580
So I helped you.

282
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,519
And you didn't die.

283
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,380
What?

284
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:28,320
The three of us never fell apart. What could I possibly do?

285
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:32,719
If I visited you, they would've suspected me too.

286
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:40,800
Fine.

287
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,679
What happened to your face?

288
00:22:58,479 --> 00:22:59,519
Shoot.

289
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:04,259
Dang it.

290
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,090
Jun Hee told me to kill him...

291
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,429
and never to lay a hand on you.

292
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:12,529
So?

293
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:15,469
Did you see where they all went?

294
00:23:17,169 --> 00:23:18,669
Jun Hee is in the restroom.

295
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:20,340
The rest are in the other building.

296
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,570
What now?

297
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,739
Whoever we kill, you'll never get to avoid their suspicion tomorrow.

298
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,419
Shoot.

299
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,429
I'm stuck.

300
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:43,560
Like you said, whoever I kill,

301
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,600
they're all going to vote me out tomorrow.

302
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,570
By the way, do you think you'd win without me?

303
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,580
She's a citizen after all.

304
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:01,350
She's not on your side.

305
00:24:02,979 --> 00:24:04,779
There aren't that many people left now.

306
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,120
They'll eventually suspect you.

307
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,529
You'll never get to win this game on your own.

308
00:24:14,729 --> 00:24:16,290
The more time you waste, the more disadvantageous it'll be.

309
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:18,229
Do as I say this time.

310
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,199
And that is?

311
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:22,469
Well,

312
00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:25,769
we don't have to kill only one.

313
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,570
You want to kill everyone today?

314
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,439
Hey, remember Yu Jun?

315
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:33,140
Even though he got killed in broad daylight, nothing happened.

316
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,410
Let's just...

317
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:37,519
kill them all.

318
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,630
Okay.

319
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:49,890
I'll kill...

320
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,729
Yoon Seo and Jun Hee.

321
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,529
You should head to the other building.

322
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:56,800
Are you telling me to go alone?

323
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,238
There's no time.

324
00:24:58,239 --> 00:25:00,340
How are we going to find them all when we can't check the CCTVs?

325
00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:01,669
We have to move separately.

326
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,120
By the way,

327
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:16,050
you've only made plans until now.

328
00:25:18,459 --> 00:25:19,719
You never killed anyone before.

329
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,590
Are you sure you can kill Yoon Seo?

330
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,570
If she has to die,

331
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,469
I'd rather kill her than let you do it.

332
00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:42,509
Fine.

333
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,449
Good luck.

334
00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:27,790
It's faster if you stab her.

335
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:30,699
- Do you want me to do it? - I said I don't want that.

336
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,630
All we need to do is to kill her somehow.

337
00:26:36,969 --> 00:26:38,239
It's not just anyone...

338
00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:40,810
but Yoon Seo.

339
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,209
Let me do this for her at least.

340
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:49,410
If we leave her here like this, she'll die in 30 minutes.

341
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,590
Sure.

342
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:58,620
Check if she's dead in 30 minutes and message me.

343
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,529
Make sure to kill Jun Hee too.

344
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,800
(Muryeong Youth Retreat Center)

345
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,820
What?

346
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,419
My goodness.

347
00:29:17,429 --> 00:29:18,459
Gosh.

348
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:21,370
Goodness.

349
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:34,910
(Restricted Area)

350
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:01,540
Jun Hee is dead.

351
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:15,749
So we can kill them all.

352
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:20,580
It's cold now.

353
00:31:41,739 --> 00:31:42,810
Did you find them?

354
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,310
I'm still looking for the two. Give me some time.

355
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:51,519
What about Lee Yoon Seo?

356
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,819
She's dead.

357
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,429
(She's dead.)

358
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,560
Are you sure she's dead?

359
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,900
If you can't trust me, see it for yourself in the freezer.

360
00:32:58,249 --> 00:32:59,249
I'm on my way.

361
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,570
Hurry up and check, so we can go find the rest.

362
00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:25,509
Hey.

363
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,350
Remove that sheet.

364
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,890
What?

365
00:33:36,989 --> 00:33:39,189
I said go remove it!

366
00:33:39,989 --> 00:33:40,989
What are you doing?

367
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,360
