1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:11,270


2
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,540
   

3
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,780
   

4
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,910
   

5
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:33,060
   

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,420
   

7
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,720
   

8
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,760
   

9
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,960
Take the responsibility now.

10
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,240
Were you the police officer?

11
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,540
N-Na Hui.

12
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,330
I'm sorry. I was fooled by Kim So Mi, too. I knew you weren't the mafiaâ€“

13
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,110
Whatever. You're the same.

14
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,580
No, Na Hui. I knew you weren't the mafia. I trusted you.

15
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,840
Fuck. What's going on?

16
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,980
No. There must've been a mix-up.

17
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,140
Is that why you used me?

18
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,050
- To kill Gyeong Jun? 
 - Hey.

19
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:29,520
Yes, you crazy bitch. You suggested stealing the keys first.

20
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,950
Did you kill Gyeong Jun, too?

21
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,060
- No. 
 - Fuck.

22
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,680
Did you do that to Eun Ha when you were the mafia?

23
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,590
She wouldn't have died if it weren't for you.

24
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,310
How could you have done that to Eun Ha?

25
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,570
What else could I have done?

26
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,480
I did that because I wanted to live. Okay?

27
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,770
I didn't want to be the fucking mafia, either!

28
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,570
Stop spewing bullshit.

29
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,610
You only care about your survival?

30
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:11,720
What about us then? Can we just die? Well?

31
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,010
I swear I didn't kill anyone.

32
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,280
Others did.

33
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,050
I have nothing to do with Park Se Eun, either.

34
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,480
Hey.

35
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,750
Don't use Se Eun just so you can live.

36
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,450
You don't have the right to do that.

37
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,260
Who do you think you are? Well?

38
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,600
No one believes you anymore.

39
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,930
- You'd better shut up. 
 - Hey, that's enough!

40
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,800
Jun Hui.

41
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,930
Please spare me.

42
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,390
Please?

43
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,010
Be responsible, like you said.

44
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:12,210
 - Kim Jun Hui voted for Kim So Mi.  
 - No.

45
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:17,220
- No. No. Please don't! 
  - Oh Jeong Won voted for Kim So Mi. 

46
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,800
- Please don't. Don't vote. 
 -  Ahn Na Hui voted for Kim So Mi. 

47
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,220
Give me your phone.

48
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,450
- Give me your phone! 
 - That's enough!

49
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,710
You're all being fooled right now.

50
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,100
Do you know who the mafia is? Well?

51
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:08,510
 You cannot tell the civilians who else is the mafia. 

52
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,700
Fuck.

53
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,540
You have to be kidding.

54
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,010
Hey.

55
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,530
Just die.

56
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:33,210
 Im Eun Chan voted for Kim So Mi. 

57
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:38,550
 Nam Yeon Wu voted for Kim So Mi. 

58
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,760
Why did you do that?

59
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,540
You did this to yourself.

60
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,770
   

61
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:57,320
 Lee Yun Seo voted for Kim So Mi. 

62
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,080
We should hide. Let's get going.

63
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,660
- Park Se Eun. 
  - The voting has ended. 

64
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,390
 Kim So Mi, the one with the most votes, will be executed. 

65
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,140
   

66
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,550
   

67
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,940
   

68
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,110
   

69
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,010
   

70
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,330
 Hyeon Ho! No! 

71
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,320
 Hyeon Ho! 

72
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:33,390
 I know what your occupation is. 

73
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,990
   

74
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,590
   

75
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,420
 It's me. I'm the mafia. 

76
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,210
 Just vote for him and be done with it! 

77
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,400
   

78
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,240
   

79
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,500
Only you and I are left now.

80
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,740
Let's get rid of the police officer first.

81
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,830
Yun Seo.

82
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,520
Get up, Lee Yun Seo.

83
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,800
What's wrong? Did you have a dream?

84
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,890
 Ahn Na Hui was executed by the mafia overnight. 

85
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:38,110
 Ahn Na Hui was a police officer. 

86
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:44,280
 All participants, please find the mafia and begin voting. 

87
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,160
No.

88
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,840
Aish! Seriously...

89
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,720
Why...

90
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,420
Why...

91
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,460
Why... Why?

92
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,860
Poor Na Hui...

93
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,220
The police officer is gone now. How do we find the mafia now?

94
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,140
We found out who spread the rumor about Se Eun.

95
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,960
But why isn't the game over?

96
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,730
Does it end only if we find all the mafia members?

97
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,370
I don't know, either.

98
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,360
Gosh, seriously.

99
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,960
 Hey. 

100
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,950
 Hey, Park Se Eun! 

101
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,350
 Hey! 

102
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,150
There aren't that many people left now.

103
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,920
What do we do?

104
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,190
Where are the other guys, by the way?

105
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,890
Are they upstairs?

106
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,300
I didn't see them.

107
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,950
You're right. I don't see both Choi Mi Na and Jin Da Beom.

108
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,120
Maybe they're devising a plan.

109
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,110
The three of them stole the keys together, too.

110
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,180
Those bastards.

111
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,540
Who will they kill this time?

112
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,330
Hey.

113
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,920
Shouldn't we prepare something, too?

114
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,310
Prepare what?

115
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:55,350
We need to do something so the mafia bastards can't kill us.

116
00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:00,240
Let's tie our hands and feet to bed so no one can move or something.

117
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,470
Let's talk about it when everyone's here.

118
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,030
Did you change your clothes?

119
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,940
What? What's going on?

120
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:52,160
You showed me how to check for blood last time.

121
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,300
We'll find this instead of blood this time.

122
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,050
Na Hui asked me.

123
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:06,950
She asked me to find the one who killed her if she died.

124
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:12,970
 I'm only talking to you since I didn't know who to trust. 

125
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,090
 The mafia will come to kill me first. 

126
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,460
 Please help me. 

127
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,050
 Okay. I will. 

128
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,270
 Let's hide first. 

129
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,490
 Not that. 

130
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,410
 Help me find the mafia. 

131
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,880
 What? 

132
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,430
 Just like how Yun Seo found the footprints, 

133
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,340
 I just need to set things up 

134
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:37,070
 so you can identify who killed me if they come to kill me. 

135
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,520
 There have been many opportunities, 

136
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,730
 but I ruined everything. 

137
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:53,140
 I could've saved more people if I used my ability better. 

138
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,530
 But I ruined everything. 

139
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,310
 Jun Hui. 

140
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:03,110
 I want to do things properly this time. 

141
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,780
 Thank you, Jun Hui. 

142
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,320
 I'll come for you first thing in the morning. 

143
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,650
 See you tomorrow. 

144
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,050
I added glow-in-the-dark paint to the room freshener.

145
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,920
This must be on the shoes of Na Hui's killer.

146
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:26,870
Are you sure Na Hui asked you to do this?

147
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,290
Aren't you lying?

148
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,150
I agree.

149
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:34,460
Now that Na Hui's dead, how are we supposed to believe you?

150
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,860
You believe me now, right?

151
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,960
You won't oppose it unless you're the mafia, right?

152
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,330
That's real, right?

153
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,510
What? What's wrong with this?

154
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,910
I said it was her.

155
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:14,810
I thought you were suspicious when you suggested stealing Gyeong Jun's keys.

156
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:19,600
No, something went wrong. I-It wasn't me.

157
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,550
Did you kill Na Hui?

158
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,930
I didn't kill her!

159
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,590
I didn't even know where she was. How was I supposed to kill her?

160
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,410
Why is that on you if you didn't?

161
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:30,630
How am I supposed to know that?

162
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,370
I'm a civilian, I said.

163
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,540
- Do you have evidence? 
 - What?

164
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,410
Do you have evidence that you're a civilian?

165
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,170
I think we found a mafia member.

166
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,100
Let's vote now.

167
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,120
Are you out of your mind?

168
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,410
I said it wasn't me. I'm a civilian.

169
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,140
We agreed to vote at night.

170
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,800
What for? It's clear. What's the point of waiting?

171
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,770
- Let's just vote now. 
 - Fuck. Stop, I said.

172
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,830
How many times did I say I didn't do it?

173
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,870
You still can't explain why you stole Gyeong Jun's keys.

174
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,490
It's because Kim So Mi made meâ€“

175
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,750
She didn't make you do anything.

176
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,740
You plotted together to kill Na Hui.

177
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,460
I said I didn't.

178
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,380
I was used by Kim So Mi, too.

179
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,600
Please calm down.

180
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,630
Give me that.

181
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,420
Let me see the bottom.

182
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,490
This one, too.

183
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,980
It should've been on the sole, too, if she was actually there.

184
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,370
It's suspicious how there's only a little on the side.

185
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:39,740
Someone might've put it on there. It's not clear.

186
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,200
Fine.

187
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,820
Let's vote at night as planned.

188
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,480
We need to vote when everyone's on board.

189
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,210
Jun Hui.

190
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,740
- Turn off the light. 
 - Okay.

191
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,900
Look.

192
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,170
It sprayed so much...

193
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,950
but there was only a little bit on Mi Na's shoes.

194
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:39,620
Since there was none on everyone else's shoes,

195
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,780
the mafia member might not have had their shoes on.

196
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,790
That's a possibility.

197
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,640
Look at this. There's something in here.

198
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,430
Hold on.

199
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,150
- Turn on the light. 
 - Okay.

200
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,550
This is blood.

201
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,830
Blood?

202
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,170
Yes.

203
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,470
They must've gotten injured a lot,

204
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:40,740
but Na Hui didn't have a wound.

205
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,410
Then whose blood is that?

206
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:05,420
Could you go check on Mi Na?

207
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,380
I'll talk to Jun Hui a bit.

208
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,100
Okay.

209
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,090
Jun Hui.

210
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:29,190
The mafia member might've gotten injured looking for Na Hui.

211
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:34,630
I think it's wrong to blame Mi Na because of her shoes.

212
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,430
Okay.

213
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,340
We can check,

214
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:45,180
but we'll vote for Mi Na if we still can't find one.

215
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,320
But Jun Hui...

216
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:53,700
The mafia might be using Mi Na the way they used Jin Ha.

217
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:58,850
- We'll fail to catch the mafia again then. 
 - The evidence only points to Mi Na.

218
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,690
Until when will you let the mafia fool you?

219
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,580
Jun Hui.

220
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,010
I can't stand to see the kids dying anymore.

221
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,500
Please let us get out of here.

222
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,960
Let's go home, Yun Seo.

223
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:35,060
Of course, it was her if that was only on her shoes.

224
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,630
What's with Lee Yun Seo?

225
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:42,130
That's what I'm saying. What's the point of waiting until the night comes?

226
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,740
What's this?

227
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,910
I thought you might be hungry.

228
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,330
So I bought these for you.

229
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,240
Wow, shit.

230
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:08,320
Yeon Wu, you must be hungry. Have some ramen.

231
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,030
Get lost!

232
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:16,390
It's all over your shoes. My gosh.

233
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,460
What are you doing?

234
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,090
It's okay.

235
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:30,490
Yeon Wu, I swear I'm not the mafia.

236
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:35,410
Yeon Wu, I swear I'm not mafia. Please spare me just once.

237
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:40,040
Shouldn't you guys believe me? We used to be close.

238
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,520
Eun Chan, please let me live.

239
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,740
I swear I'm not the mafia.

240
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:47,410
You framed Eun Ha as a mafia with Kim So Mi!

241
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:51,440
No. Eun Ha suggested voting for Yul, so I had no choice.

242
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,890
I swear I'm not the mafia, guys. Please, just this once. Please listen to me.

243
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:58,030
Get out. Get lost, I said!

244
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,870
Sons of bitches.

245
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:17,820
Just wait and see what I'd do.

246
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,090
Hey, Choi Mi Na.

247
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:38,320
So the one who got injured in the bathroom is the mafia, right?

248
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,220
Yes.

249
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,130
But we aren't sure yet. Just keep that in mind.

250
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:45,640
Don't go around telling people.

251
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,870
Okay.

252
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:52,770
Anyway, look. I have no wounds at all.

253
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:56,430
Look at this. I didn't get injured anywhere. I'm not a mafiaâ€“

254
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,170
Okay.

255
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,970
Thank you for helping me, Jeong Won.

256
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,690
I actually really wanted to be friends with you.

257
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,880
Same with Yun Seo.

258
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,910
All of a sudden?

259
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:20,930
No, I've actually thought that for long.

260
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:26,320
But I'm happy because it feels like we finally got close.

261
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,820
You should hold onto these.

262
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,810
I'll just follow you around.

263
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,670
Why are you giving these to me?

264
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,870
It's because we're both civilians.

265
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:51,790
I wouldn't give this to you if I were the mafia. I'm not stupid.

266
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,090
Please believe me just once, Jeong Won.

267
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,740
I'm really not the mafia.

268
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,750
Choi Mi Na didn't have any noticeable wounds.

269
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,950
I didn't notice anything strange talking to her, either.

270
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,810
I'll check the others, then.

271
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:31,020
The mafia kept fooling us, right?

272
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,000
How about...

273
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,130
we try fooling them this time?

274
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:38,440
What?

275
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,230
How?

276
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,600
I found the camera Na Hui set up secretly.

277
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,620
What if we tell them it died and it's being charged?

278
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:52,680
 They'll try to get rid of it just like the CCTV last time. 

279
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,760
 We found the camera Na Hui set up before she died. 

280
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,770
 It's charging now. We'll find out who the mafia is soon. 

281
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:04,300
 Let's meet up in thirty minutes. 

282
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,830
   

283
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,420
   

284
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,250
   

285
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,310
   

286
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:31,120
We'll separate the most suspicious pair and create a situation.

287
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,830
 Who will end up revealing themselves? 

288
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,300
Do you think that would work?

289
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,110
We'll give them no choice but to make a move.

290
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,590
Yes.

291
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,970
Let's try it.

292
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:08,810
So where's the camera again?

293
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:12,830
Hey. It's charging in the cafeteria.

294
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,230
I'll step out for a second.

295
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,410
Okay. See you.

296
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,740
Aish.

297
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:37,990
Hey, let's just wait in the snack bar.

298
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,400
Is it done charging?

299
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,380
Where are we meeting up?

300
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,260
In the snack bar. We're on our way, too.

301
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,200
I'll come with you.

302
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:06,390
By the way, where's Nam Yeon Wu?

303
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,810
He went to the clinic because he was in pain.

304
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:13,970
 So the one who got injured in the bathroom is the mafia, right? 

305
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:17,780
 - Yes. 
 - Fuck. Stop, I said. 

306
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,670
Look.

307
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:40,130
What do you want to check...

308
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,570
What are you doing?

309
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:57,230
What's this? Let me look.

310
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:00,240
Hey, look at this bastard.

311
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,880
Hey, Nam Yeon Wu.

312
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,710
What's with that wound?

313
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,160
I-It's nothing.

314
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,100
Why is this empty?

315
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,270
I asked what that wound was.

316
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,800
I got hurt, okay?

317
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,630
What is it? Are you worried you got filmed?

318
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:30,320
Well, hey. It's not that...

319
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,700
No, something went wrong with this.

320
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:35,750
Hurry, you mafia bastard!

321
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,890
Hey, you crazy bitch!

322
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:39,460
Just let go and talk.

323
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,440
Hey, guys. Y-You're mistaken.

324
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,680
It's not me.

325
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,520
Shit...

326
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,110
How can you say that after seeing this?

327
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,920
It's not me!

328
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,100
P-Please hear me out.

329
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,280
What's wrong?

330
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,700
What's there to hear? You're the mafia.

331
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,070
Nam Yeon Wu has a wound.

00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:33,190
   

337
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,650
