(Oh Jung Won)

9
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:39,905
Darn it.

10
00:00:45,414 --> 00:00:49,615
A Mafia can't kill another Mafia.

11
00:00:51,755 --> 00:00:52,755
Darn it.

12
00:00:54,185 --> 00:00:55,425
You know what happens...

13
00:00:56,355 --> 00:00:57,795
when you violate the rules, don't you?

14
00:00:59,165 --> 00:01:00,195
If you kill me,

15
00:01:01,665 --> 00:01:02,695
you'll die with me.

16
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:07,805
Darn it. Hey!

17
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:11,974
I'll kill you, you scumbag!

18
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,415
Where are you?

19
00:01:30,355 --> 00:01:31,394
Open the door!

20
00:01:33,295 --> 00:01:34,594
Open the door, darn it!

21
00:01:42,264 --> 00:01:43,335
Give up.

22
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:46,874
It'll be over in 30 minutes anyway.

23
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,014
What the heck are you talking about?

24
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:53,215
Why isn't it here? Why?

25
00:01:55,185 --> 00:01:57,314
We're on the same side. You can't do this.

26
00:01:59,325 --> 00:02:00,985
It's coming to an end. Why are you doing this?

27
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,155
Please get it together!

28
00:02:04,455 --> 00:02:06,265
Even if you save Yoon Seo and Jun Hee,

29
00:02:06,694 --> 00:02:10,134
they're Citizens and you're a Mafia. You can't survive together.

30
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:12,664
Darn you, Oh Jung Won!

31
00:02:14,465 --> 00:02:15,735
You know...

32
00:02:16,474 --> 00:02:18,634
the sense of hearing is the last one to go...

33
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:21,004
when you die, don't you?

34
00:02:23,775 --> 00:02:24,914
Listen up.

35
00:02:26,485 --> 00:02:28,314
Darn it. If I die, I'll take Yoon Seo with me.

36
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:49,574
Na Hee?

37
00:03:05,215 --> 00:03:08,185
Check if she's dead after 30 minutes and send me a message.

38
00:03:25,435 --> 00:03:26,844
Gosh.

39
00:04:39,284 --> 00:04:40,344
It's cold.

40
00:04:45,755 --> 00:04:48,255
The blanket.

41
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:05,575
My goodness.

42
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:07,744
Oh, my gosh.

43
00:05:08,304 --> 00:05:09,315
Gosh.

44
00:05:11,575 --> 00:05:12,614
Darn it.

45
00:05:21,025 --> 00:05:22,025
Please.

46
00:05:27,965 --> 00:05:30,565
What's going on?

47
00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:34,664
Why has it turned off?

48
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:41,674
What is it?

49
00:05:42,645 --> 00:05:43,645
Who is it?

50
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:45,614
Who is it?

51
00:05:50,515 --> 00:05:52,755
Why are you doing this? Don't do this.

52
00:05:55,724 --> 00:05:56,724
Gosh.

53
00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:00,794
Who the heck are you?

54
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:02,494
Why are you doing this to me?

55
00:06:40,335 --> 00:06:41,364
Darn it!

56
00:06:43,835 --> 00:06:44,835
Don't come.

57
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,304
Don't come near me, you jerk.

58
00:06:47,244 --> 00:06:49,544
Darn it. Why?

59
00:06:49,945 --> 00:06:51,875
Why are you messing with me even when you're dead?

60
00:06:53,744 --> 00:06:56,585
If I hadn't killed you, you would've killed me!

61
00:06:58,054 --> 00:06:59,054
Get lost!

62
00:06:59,684 --> 00:07:01,385
Darn it! Get lost!

63
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:13,223
During the night, Im Eun Chan...

64
00:08:13,224 --> 00:08:17,065
and Choi Mi Na were executed by the Mafia.

65
00:08:17,635 --> 00:08:22,465
Im Eun Chan and Choi Mi Na were Citizens.

66
00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:25,933
All participants,

67
00:08:25,934 --> 00:08:28,775
identify the Mafia and begin to vote.

68
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,265
If you were going to do this,

69
00:08:48,324 --> 00:08:49,464
you should've killed me as well.

70
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:51,895
Why did you keep me alive?

71
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:56,235
For the game to end in the way you guys want, I should die anyway.

72
00:08:58,574 --> 00:09:00,304
Why did you save me?

73
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,475
Why did you keep me alive?

74
00:09:05,314 --> 00:09:07,645
What on earth are you thinking?

75
00:09:12,655 --> 00:09:14,084
I can't have a long talk right now.

76
00:09:15,684 --> 00:09:18,424
For now, I should deal with Da Bum.

77
00:09:20,564 --> 00:09:21,564
What...

78
00:09:25,135 --> 00:09:26,204
does that mean?

79
00:09:35,204 --> 00:09:36,444
Did you kill them?

80
00:09:39,885 --> 00:09:40,885
Answer me.

81
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:44,115
Hey.

82
00:09:46,554 --> 00:09:47,784
Tell me!

83
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,495
Calm down.

84
00:09:52,095 --> 00:09:53,125
Let's talk later.

85
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:57,294
Jung Won.

86
00:09:58,034 --> 00:09:59,034
Hey!

87
00:09:59,434 --> 00:10:00,464
Jun Hee.

88
00:10:02,464 --> 00:10:03,834
How can she do this to us?

89
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:40,975
(Cleaning Tools)

90
00:10:47,515 --> 00:10:48,615
(Will you vote for Jin Da Bum?)

91
00:10:48,985 --> 00:10:50,554
(Oh Jung Won voted for Jin Da Bum.)

92
00:10:57,755 --> 00:11:00,865
Da Bum will try to kill you guys when he sees you guys. Be careful.

93
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:05,265
Why do you think...

94
00:11:06,635 --> 00:11:08,204
Jung Won kept us alive?

95
00:11:08,964 --> 00:11:10,875
Forget it. Don't think about it anymore.

96
00:11:11,174 --> 00:11:12,674
Now, we can't trust either of them anyway.

97
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,274
Let's vote for Da Bum...

98
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,615
and think about what we will do.

99
00:11:18,475 --> 00:11:19,684
What do you mean?

100
00:11:20,145 --> 00:11:22,544
If we both vote for Da Bum as well, he won't stay still.

101
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,385
He will try whatever he can.

102
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:30,294
And even if he dies, Jung Won will still be alive.

103
00:11:31,054 --> 00:11:32,125
Things will work against us at night.

104
00:11:32,495 --> 00:11:33,625
We should sort it out before that.

105
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,765
What...

106
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:38,834
are you thinking?

107
00:11:40,235 --> 00:11:41,405
If it doesn't work,

108
00:11:45,235 --> 00:11:46,574
we should kill her to stop her.

109
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,984
I'll go to the warehouse. Something might happen.

110
00:11:53,985 --> 00:11:54,985
I'll go with you.

111
00:11:55,544 --> 00:11:57,584
No. You take a rest.

112
00:11:57,954 --> 00:12:00,025
- Why? I want to go too. - Just listen to me.

113
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:02,084
The other guys are upstairs.

114
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,694
I won't take long. Lock the door.

115
00:12:09,735 --> 00:12:10,735
Okay.

116
00:13:21,505 --> 00:13:22,765
(Oh Jung Won)

117
00:13:35,084 --> 00:13:38,655
Happy birthday to you

118
00:13:39,584 --> 00:13:42,525
Happy birthday to you

119
00:13:43,525 --> 00:13:45,424
- What's this? - A birthday gift.

120
00:13:52,595 --> 00:13:53,804
(Happy birthday, Se Eun. I got a lucky bracelet for you.)

121
00:14:02,905 --> 00:14:03,914
Can you put it on me?

122
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:10,114
- Thank you. - Do you like it?

123
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,355
Very much.

124
00:14:24,194 --> 00:14:25,664
Jung Won's not there.

125
00:14:29,804 --> 00:14:30,875
(Game Development Contest)

126
00:14:31,034 --> 00:14:33,275
(Oh Jung Won)

127
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:36,375
Why did you save me?

128
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:38,544
Why did you keep me alive?

129
00:14:39,275 --> 00:14:40,745
I can't have a long talk right now.

130
00:14:47,385 --> 00:14:48,424
No way.

131
00:15:11,015 --> 00:15:12,444
Da Bum disappeared.

132
00:15:13,214 --> 00:15:15,283
I'll search for him. You go to Yoon Seo and...

133
00:15:15,284 --> 00:15:16,284
No.

134
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:18,755
I'm not going to let you guys fool me anymore.

135
00:15:19,684 --> 00:15:21,725
He's going to kill all of us.

136
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,694
- It's dangerous. - Enough!

137
00:15:27,095 --> 00:15:29,595
Hey, I heard you're a Mafia as well.

138
00:15:32,694 --> 00:15:35,265
You and Da Bum are no different to Yoon Seo and me.

139
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:46,914
If you want to save Yoon Seo, come to the rooftop.

140
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:49,954
Darn it.

141
00:16:05,635 --> 00:16:06,635
Yoon Seo!

142
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,505
You guys are pathetic.

143
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:15,574
Don't come near me.

144
00:16:16,174 --> 00:16:17,245
Don't do it, you crazy punk.

145
00:16:17,814 --> 00:16:19,745
Stop this and release her.

146
00:16:21,385 --> 00:16:23,355
Did you kill Kyung Jun and Seung Bin?

147
00:16:24,714 --> 00:16:26,724
Are you happy that you became just like them?

148
00:16:26,725 --> 00:16:28,125
Shut your mouth.

149
00:16:29,184 --> 00:16:30,725
You don't have to take it this far.

150
00:16:36,534 --> 00:16:37,635
How do you feel about seeing me again?

151
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,064
You're glad, aren't you?

152
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,803
It's me who you want to kill.

153
00:16:41,804 --> 00:16:42,934
Let go of her.

154
00:16:46,235 --> 00:16:47,804
I seriously want to do that.

155
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:49,174
But I have no choice.

156
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,975
I can't stab you, darn it.

157
00:16:52,414 --> 00:16:54,444
- So what do you want? - What do I want?

158
00:16:55,184 --> 00:16:56,484
I will do what I couldn't do yesterday.

159
00:16:58,855 --> 00:16:59,855
Get up there.

160
00:17:05,194 --> 00:17:06,865
- Do you want me to fall? - Yes.

161
00:17:08,024 --> 00:17:09,964
If I can't kill you, you should kill yourself.

162
00:17:16,164 --> 00:17:17,574
No.

163
00:17:17,575 --> 00:17:18,733
Shut your mouth.

164
00:17:18,734 --> 00:17:20,905
Enough is enough, you piece of trash.

165
00:17:21,944 --> 00:17:24,075
Hey. Just do it to me.

166
00:17:24,274 --> 00:17:25,714
You stay out of this.

167
00:17:26,174 --> 00:17:27,714
Just shut up and watch!

168
00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:29,045
But...

169
00:17:31,714 --> 00:17:33,014
what happens after I die?

170
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,125
Are you going to release her?

171
00:17:37,895 --> 00:17:38,994
That...

172
00:17:40,464 --> 00:17:41,523
depends on you.

173
00:17:41,524 --> 00:17:43,464
You won't keep her alive even if I die.

174
00:17:44,635 --> 00:17:45,663
Do you not want to jump?

175
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,565
- Do you want me to kill her now? - That's not what I'm talking about!

176
00:17:51,535 --> 00:17:52,934
I'd love to do that,

177
00:17:53,944 --> 00:17:56,575
but I can't because it's against the rules.

178
00:17:57,645 --> 00:17:58,974
What are you talking about?

179
00:17:59,174 --> 00:18:00,615
Mafias can't commit suicide.

180
00:18:01,785 --> 00:18:02,885
We can't kill ourselves.

181
00:18:03,145 --> 00:18:05,385
What do you mean we can't? What about Ju Won?

182
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,825
She was executed because she violated the rules.

183
00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:10,194
She was in a different situation.

184
00:18:10,595 --> 00:18:12,095
Darn it. I told you not to come.

185
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:14,424
I'm dying because you threatened me.

186
00:18:14,764 --> 00:18:15,923
So it's you who are killing me.

187
00:18:15,924 --> 00:18:17,234
Shut up and jump right now!

188
00:18:18,095 --> 00:18:20,605
Don't you remember the warning in the freezer yesterday?

189
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:23,905
Do...

190
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:25,703
you want to die with me?

191
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:28,045
Don't come. Just jump!

192
00:18:30,014 --> 00:18:31,045
You jerk!

193
00:18:41,825 --> 00:18:43,694
Just die!

194
00:18:46,454 --> 00:18:47,865
- Are you okay? - Yes.

195
00:18:52,135 --> 00:18:53,535
Let go, you piece of trash.

196
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:07,944
Darn it!

197
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,694
Let's just...

198
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:19,754
die together.

199
00:19:38,014 --> 00:19:39,075
Yoon Seo.

200
00:19:50,895 --> 00:19:51,954
Yoon Seo.

201
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,865
You crazy jerk!

202
00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:12,914
You scumbag!

203
00:20:36,664 --> 00:20:37,905
Darn it.

204
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:05,635
Jin Da Bum has died.

205
00:21:06,295 --> 00:21:10,135
Jin Da Bum was a Mafia.

206
00:21:10,974 --> 00:21:11,974
Hang on.

207
00:21:12,734 --> 00:21:13,875
You should stay awake.

208
00:21:17,345 --> 00:21:18,444
It hurts.

209
00:21:21,885 --> 00:21:23,585
Are you not hurt?

210
00:21:24,385 --> 00:21:25,714
I'm fine.

211
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:32,625
It hurts.

212
00:21:37,494 --> 00:21:39,233
- Don't speak. - Okay. I'm okay.

213
00:21:39,234 --> 00:21:40,763
- Don't talk. - I'm fine.

214
00:21:40,764 --> 00:21:41,865
Don't talk.

215
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:45,274
I was going to resolve it.

216
00:21:46,674 --> 00:21:49,045
Why did you do that?

217
00:21:53,714 --> 00:21:54,785
I'm sorry.

218
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,484
I think I know who you are now.

219
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:02,684
I missed you.

220
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:06,524
Se Eun.

221
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:10,395
But...

222
00:22:11,295 --> 00:22:12,565
stop it now.

223
00:22:21,504 --> 00:22:22,504
I'm sorry.

224
00:22:26,815 --> 00:22:27,845
I had...

225
00:22:29,645 --> 00:22:31,414
no choice.

226
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:34,825
I know.

227
00:22:36,754 --> 00:22:37,795
It's okay.

228
00:22:40,464 --> 00:22:41,464
So...

229
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,535
stop it now.

230
00:22:47,264 --> 00:22:48,305
Yoon Seo.

231
00:22:48,905 --> 00:22:49,934
Yoon Seo!

232
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:51,433
Stay with us.

233
00:22:51,434 --> 00:22:52,934
Stay awake!

234
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:54,444
Yoon Seo.

235
00:23:07,924 --> 00:23:09,085
Hang in there.

236
00:23:10,954 --> 00:23:12,224
I'll get you out of here.

237
00:23:16,494 --> 00:23:17,565
No.

238
00:23:25,105 --> 00:23:26,105
Jung Won.

239
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:29,904
(Oh Jung Won)

240
00:23:29,905 --> 00:23:30,914
Hey.

241
00:23:35,885 --> 00:23:36,914
Yoon Seo.

242
00:23:39,815 --> 00:23:40,825
Yoon Seo.

243
00:23:41,285 --> 00:23:42,385
Lee Yoon Seo!

244
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:44,055
Yoon Seo!

245
00:23:51,434 --> 00:23:52,635
Yoon Seo!

246
00:24:14,184 --> 00:24:17,224
(Lee Yoon Seo)

247
00:24:34,504 --> 00:24:37,774
(Oh Jung Won)

248
00:24:42,684 --> 00:24:45,984
Oh Jung Won has died.

249
00:24:46,815 --> 00:24:50,594
Oh Jung Won was a Mafia.

250
00:24:50,595 --> 00:24:51,625
Yoon Seo!

251
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:57,065
The Mafia Game has ended. The Citizens are victorious.

252
00:26:01,924 --> 00:26:02,964
Jun Hee.

253
00:26:04,035 --> 00:26:05,065
Jun Hee.

254
00:26:05,835 --> 00:26:06,865
Get up.

255
00:26:10,264 --> 00:26:11,274
Kim Jun Hee.

256
00:26:12,335 --> 00:26:13,405
Leave him alone.

257
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:23,645
If you wake him while he's on the server,

258
00:26:24,184 --> 00:26:25,655
he could fall into a coma.

259
00:26:32,055 --> 00:26:33,124
(Ko Kyung Jun)

260
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:37,294
(Kim So Mi, Park Woo Ram)

261
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,694
(Lee Yoon Seo)

262
00:26:47,244 --> 00:26:48,575
(Kim Jun Hee)

263
00:26:53,274 --> 00:26:54,285
Do you...

264
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:56,615
remember us?

265
00:27:00,155 --> 00:27:01,754
You're Se Eun's parents.

266
00:27:06,355 --> 00:27:07,395
What is...

267
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:10,164
all this?

268
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:17,375
How was the game?

269
00:27:23,305 --> 00:27:24,444
Was death...

270
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:27,385
scary and painful enough?

271
00:27:28,115 --> 00:27:29,145
What?

272
00:27:34,184 --> 00:27:35,724
(Ahn Na Hee)

273
00:27:37,224 --> 00:27:38,355
Why are they like that?

274
00:27:39,895 --> 00:27:41,224
What did you do?

275
00:27:42,724 --> 00:27:43,764
Don't worry.

276
00:27:45,494 --> 00:27:46,764
They're all just asleep.

277
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:52,805
They're unconscious.

278
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:55,974
But the suffering is real.

279
00:27:57,214 --> 00:27:58,474
All of this was a game?

280
00:28:01,315 --> 00:28:03,014
You guys haven't been here for long,

281
00:28:03,914 --> 00:28:06,914
but you played the game dozens of times already.

282
00:28:08,184 --> 00:28:10,224
Time moves at a different speed within the game.

283
00:28:11,224 --> 00:28:13,295
We had set up the game...

284
00:28:14,164 --> 00:28:17,194
so Jung Won would always be the last one standing.

285
00:28:17,994 --> 00:28:19,734
This is the first time you've won.

286
00:28:21,704 --> 00:28:23,663
What did you do to Jung Won...

287
00:28:23,664 --> 00:28:24,704
that she helped you?

288
00:28:27,744 --> 00:28:28,774
Tell me.

289
00:28:29,444 --> 00:28:30,845
I must know, so I can fix it.

290
00:28:32,474 --> 00:28:34,385
I woke you up to ask you that.

291
00:28:37,815 --> 00:28:38,855
Why on earth...

292
00:28:40,214 --> 00:28:42,155
are you doing this? Why?

293
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:47,095
In the world my daughter created,

294
00:28:47,795 --> 00:28:49,524
you all must pay the price.

295
00:28:51,095 --> 00:28:52,234
For what?

296
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,434
"For what?"

297
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,674
Did you just say, "For what?"

298
00:29:07,385 --> 00:29:10,385
For bullying my innocent Se Eun.

299
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:13,513
For believing the groundless rumors...

300
00:29:13,514 --> 00:29:15,024
and driving her to her death!

301
00:29:16,285 --> 00:29:17,295
That's your crime.

302
00:29:35,305 --> 00:29:36,374
(Original copy)

303
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:37,714
(Applying changes)

304
00:29:38,315 --> 00:29:40,474
Hey. Get lost.

305
00:29:42,585 --> 00:29:44,253
What's this?

306
00:29:44,254 --> 00:29:45,814
- What are you doing? - Is he watching porn?

307
00:29:45,815 --> 00:29:46,884
Give it back!

308
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,655
- Give it to me! - Let go.

309
00:29:49,484 --> 00:29:50,693
- What's this? - It's my phone.

310
00:29:50,694 --> 00:29:51,723
Hey, look.

311
00:29:51,724 --> 00:29:52,954
- Look. - Darn it.

312
00:29:53,994 --> 00:29:54,994
Look at that.

313
00:29:56,024 --> 00:29:57,664
- Hey. - I want my phone back!

314
00:30:03,004 --> 00:30:05,135
(Park Se Eun)

315
00:30:21,924 --> 00:30:23,085
(Kang Ye Won)

316
00:30:37,234 --> 00:30:38,273
(Send it quickly!)

317
00:30:38,274 --> 00:30:39,274
(Spread it fast, you punk!)

318
00:30:39,274 --> 00:30:40,274
(Or else, we'll send out yours!)

319
00:30:50,585 --> 00:30:52,585
(Sexy dance debut, shows hot body, come watch)

320
00:30:54,224 --> 00:30:56,085

321

322
00:31:00,494 --> 00:31:01,494
(Sending)

323
00:31:07,664 --> 00:31:10,334
- It's the celebrity. - Hey, sexy.

324
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:11,405
The celebrity's here.

325
00:31:19,315 --> 00:31:20,645
Hey, look.

326
00:31:21,184 --> 00:31:22,315
Nice.

327
00:31:22,845 --> 00:31:23,885
Let me see.

328
00:31:25,714 --> 00:31:27,315
- Nice curves. - Hey.

329
00:31:52,014 --> 00:31:53,075
Where are you going?

330
00:31:55,545 --> 00:31:56,615
Se Eun.

331
00:32:00,454 --> 00:32:01,555
Park Se Eun.

332
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:04,655
Is that her?

333
00:32:09,724 --> 00:32:10,994
What's up with her?

334
00:32:12,234 --> 00:32:13,234
I don't know.

335
00:32:14,664 --> 00:32:16,234
(You have a new message.)

336
00:32:20,974 --> 00:32:22,004
(I want to see more!)

337
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:44,264
(Play the live video!)

338
00:33:06,655 --> 00:33:08,285
Your classmate had died.

339
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:10,184
So why...

340
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:12,895
didn't anyone take responsibility?

341
00:33:13,855 --> 00:33:15,464
They feared a backlash.

342
00:33:16,325 --> 00:33:17,733
"It was a joke. It was a misunderstanding."

343
00:33:17,734 --> 00:33:19,764
"I don't know anything." They all made excuses.

344
00:33:20,535 --> 00:33:22,565
No one admitted to what they'd done.

345
00:33:22,905 --> 00:33:23,934
No one.

346
00:33:26,335 --> 00:33:27,805
So we created this game.

347
00:33:32,514 --> 00:33:34,714
The pain that our Se Eun felt!

348
00:33:36,885 --> 00:33:39,684
You all had to feel it too.

349
00:33:44,224 --> 00:33:47,795
We wanted to show you what you had done.

350
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:52,795
(A new game will begin.)

351
00:34:01,345 --> 00:34:02,345
(A new game will begin.)

352
00:34:02,346 --> 00:34:04,415
(Im Eun Chan)

353
00:34:05,515 --> 00:34:06,714
(Heo Yul)

354
00:34:12,915 --> 00:34:13,915
Yes.

355
00:34:14,455 --> 00:34:18,095
I know you and Se Eun were close.

356
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,394
You should've saved her!

357
00:34:23,064 --> 00:34:24,234
Why did you let her die?

358
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:27,194
You're no different from them.

359
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:32,975
Their memories are wiped each time.

360
00:34:33,834 --> 00:34:36,975
They'll never get used to the suffering.

361
00:34:37,174 --> 00:34:39,814
(Jin Da Bum)

362
00:34:42,285 --> 00:34:43,584
It'll feel fresh every time.

363
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:48,285
For eternity,

364
00:34:49,285 --> 00:34:50,584
you can live in the game.

365
00:35:18,314 --> 00:35:19,314
Please.

366
00:35:26,055 --> 00:35:27,095
I also...

367
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:30,894
miss Se Eun...

368
00:35:33,194 --> 00:35:34,765
so much.

369
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:36,865
I want to tell her that...

370
00:35:38,535 --> 00:35:40,234
she suffered so much on her own.

371
00:35:43,305 --> 00:35:46,015
That I'm sorry I didn't know.

372
00:35:49,745 --> 00:35:51,955
If someone must take responsibility,

373
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:54,455
let me.

374
00:35:56,725 --> 00:35:59,495
So will you send the others home?

375
00:36:00,194 --> 00:36:01,225
Please?

376
00:36:04,834 --> 00:36:05,834
You're not...

377
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:09,104
completely awake yet.

378
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,305
You could fall ill if you fight it.

379
00:36:11,705 --> 00:36:12,734
I don't care...

380
00:36:14,674 --> 00:36:16,845
about being sick at all.

381
00:36:23,345 --> 00:36:24,854
So pick me.

382
00:36:28,385 --> 00:36:31,024
Please let the others go.

383
00:36:31,854 --> 00:36:32,894
Let them...

384
00:36:33,595 --> 00:36:35,595
Let them go. They...

385
00:36:52,745 --> 00:36:54,444
(Oh Jung Won)

386
00:36:58,785 --> 00:37:00,354
Her getting her memory back.

387
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,685
Jung Won helped her with that.

388
00:37:04,084 --> 00:37:05,154
Jung Won changed the setting,

389
00:37:05,155 --> 00:37:07,024
so she'd get her memory back from the birthday present.

390
00:37:13,595 --> 00:37:14,935
What are you trying to say?

391
00:37:16,205 --> 00:37:17,935
Suicide wasn't an option.

392
00:37:20,575 --> 00:37:23,274
Jung Won actually acted as if she were Se Eun.

393
00:37:24,644 --> 00:37:26,245
She chose to save the kids.

394
00:37:26,874 --> 00:37:28,385
Get a grip!

395
00:37:29,845 --> 00:37:32,084
That's not our daughter.

396
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:35,185
It's just an error caused by a setting.

397
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:38,155
Hands off.

398
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:40,854
It wasn't just an error. It was Jung Won's will.

399
00:37:42,365 --> 00:37:43,624
What if, like Jung Won,

400
00:37:44,794 --> 00:37:46,694
Se Eun doesn't want this game either?

401
00:37:49,535 --> 00:37:51,575
What if getting revenge is just what we want?

402
00:37:53,475 --> 00:37:54,544
No.

403
00:37:55,604 --> 00:37:56,674
We have a long way to go.

404
00:37:57,745 --> 00:37:58,874
We're not done yet.

405
00:37:59,615 --> 00:38:01,885
They risked their lives to save a friend.

406
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:04,754
Maybe not all of them,

407
00:38:05,354 --> 00:38:07,854
but some of them felt bad for what happened to Se Eun.

408
00:38:08,725 --> 00:38:11,754
We've seen enough to give them a chance.

409
00:38:15,064 --> 00:38:17,624
Let's let them all go and see what happens.

410
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:20,464
No.

411
00:38:21,234 --> 00:38:22,334
I can't do that.

412
00:38:26,774 --> 00:38:27,774
Move.

413
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:29,475
Move out of the way!

414
00:38:35,644 --> 00:38:36,814
What about our Se Eun?

415
00:38:39,254 --> 00:38:41,015
She's dead and gone.

417
00:40:32,535 --> 00:40:33,834
Darn it! I lost again!

418

- Gosh. - You startled me.

419
00:40:38,075 --> 00:40:39,705
- Shut up. - What's wrong?

420
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:42,074
- I'm tired. - Hello, Ms. Kim.

421
00:40:42,075 --> 00:40:43,244
- Hey. - What?

422
00:40:43,245 --> 00:40:44,405
- Join in. - Where?

423
00:40:45,115 --> 00:40:46,575
- The bus broke down? - Take a look.

424
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:51,144
Hello?

426
