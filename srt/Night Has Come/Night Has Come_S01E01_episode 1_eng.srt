1
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,620
   

2
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,740
   

3
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,930
   

4
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,410
   

5
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,510
   

6
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,790
   

7
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:56,080


8
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:56,050
   

9
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,960
   

10
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,450
   

11
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,260
I'm not. I said I'm not.

12
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,680
Don't lie. I know it's you.

13
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,090
Really. I'm telling you. It's true.

14
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,390
I'm not, okay?

15
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,210
If I were the Mafia, why did I try to stop you from getting caught?

16
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,550
- It's not that, I— 
 - It's Heo Yul, I said.

17
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,730
- You— 
 - Okay, okay, okay.

18
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,810
Now, so…

19
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,520
the innocent Civilians lost, and the Mafia won.

20
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,270
- Yes! 
 - What?

21
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,300
I said, I'm a Civilian.

22
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,750
Gosh, he's so annoying.

23
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,040
You were so good.

24
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,290
I said that Heo Yul is the Mafia.

25
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,880
- Let's do it again. Do it again. 
  - Do it again. Do it again. 

26
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,670
They're so freaking loud.

27
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,320
Next time, I'll…

28
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,580
How about us? The next time?

29
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,760
 - Oh, deal, deal, deal. Let's start now.  
 - Hey.

30
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,100
Tell them to shut up.

31
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,570
In the next round, I will kill Heo Yul first.

32
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,950
- Hey! 
 - Hurry, hurry.

33
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,950
Gyeong Jun is sleeping.

34
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,180
It's too loud.

35
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,870
Those douchebags.

36
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,400
Hey, don't do it.

37
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,650
Na Hui.

38
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,300
Don't talk to Na Hui.

39
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,730
Stop talking to Na Hui.

40
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,360
Let's switch. Let's switch right now.

41
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,400
Come on, let's switch.

42
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,680
Hey, isn't this crazy? It's like a fashion photo, right?

43
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,050
How does he look like this?

44
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,880
I'll tell Jun Hui that you took his picture.

45
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,760
Could you? I'll take the opportunity to seduce him.

46
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,630
You've been saying that since last year. When will you do it?

47
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,620
- Seduce him now. 
 - It's happening soon.

48
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,360
- Jun Hui. 
 - Don't do that.

49
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,450
Take a look at this.

50
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,890
Just sit next to him if you're going to keep staring like that.

51
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,920
I wasn't staring.

52
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,600
   

53
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:07,690
   

54
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,050
   

55
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,050
Yes, Ms. Kim.

56
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,740
 Sir, did you just arrive… 

57
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,610
- Pardon? Hello? 
  - Sir. 

58
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,450
 - Our location is—  
 - What did you say?

59
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,470
 - You just arrived, did you?  
 - Hello?

60
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,890
 - Can't you hear me?  
 - No.

61
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,460
I can't hear you well. Hello?

62
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,790
Shall we?

63
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,860
Pardon?

64
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,950
- Hyeon Ho. Help me. 
 - Only our class arrived?

65
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,290
Give it to me.

66
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:12,490
Hey, have we been here before? Why do I have the feeling we did?

67
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,100
All the youth centers look the same.

68
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,490
Hey, Lee Yun Seo.

69
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,980
I'm leaving.

70
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,410
Okay.

71
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,450
- Lee Yun Seo. 
 - What?

72
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,050
What are you doing? Let's go.

73
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,470
Okay.

74
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,730
Geez, this is so annoying.

75
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,300
   

76
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:12,370
Do you know what you want as a birthday present yet?

77
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:15,220
Tell me today. I won't get you anything if you tell me after midnight.

78
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,730
Gosh, you're so cheap.

79
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,800
I haven't decided yet.

80
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,190
A detective novel?

81
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,420
Yes, that's it.

82
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,010
Okay.

83
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,570
Gosh, seriously.

84
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:32,710
I'm not getting a good phone signal. Is it usually like this?

85
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,740
Could I make a phone call by chance?

86
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,680
It's not working right now.

87
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,030
What should I do? Do we have to leave?

88
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,100
   

89
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:56,140
Look how flirtatious So Mi is.

90
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,920
- Hey. 
 - What?

91
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,240
Stop looking. You're making it obvious.

92
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,550
I wasn't looking.

93
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,830
Of course, you were.

94
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,980
   

95
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,450
This really sucks.

96
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,040
I can do something like this in a day.

97
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,550
What do you mean?

98
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,710
Didn't you scan the QR code?

99
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,820
It was installed automatically.

100
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,120
Give me your phone. I'll do it for you.

101
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,280
What? No.

102
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,240
I can just have a look at this.

103
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,750
Do you want to carry that around for two days?

104
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,540
- Class President. 
 - Yes?

105
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,850
I have to pick up the students from another class.

106
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,310
Don't do anything else and go to your rooms.

107
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,290
Make sure they don't cause trouble, okay?

108
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,730
Okay, I understand.

109
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,430
- You, too, Class Vice President. 
 - Okay.

110
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,520
We have to take a group photo tonight when I get back.

111
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,630
Tell them to keep their uniform on.

112
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,080
- Okay. 
 - I'm leaving now.

113
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,510
Okay.

114
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,230
What's going on? Why is he so busy?

115
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,920
The Wi-Fi in here doesn't even work. It sucks.

116
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:19,600
By the way, why are we taking a group photo at night?

117
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,110
I know.

118
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,370
I'm not getting any signal.

119
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,150
   

120
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,540
 Hey. He's filming us again. 

121
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,700
Seriously, though. At least he has good taste.

122
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,900
It's not us. It's me. Me.

123
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,880
What can I do? This is all my fault.

124
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,870
She's so annoying.

125
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,330
Hey!

126
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,440
 Why did you turn the lights off? 

127
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,540
Turn the lights on.

128
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,030
Hey, stop fooling around.

129
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,800
Seriously.

130
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,570
Hey!

131
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,710
Geez.

132
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:43,500
Gosh, that psycho.

133
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,210
Hey, listen. Listen carefully.

134
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,890
I heard something about this place.

135
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,640
A female high school student once committed suicide here.

136
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,460
There is one thing that you absolutely cannot do.

137
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,460
After midnight, don't look behind you after you have looked in the mirror.

138
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:03,000
And don't look if someone grabs your ankle while you're sleeping.

139
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,760
If you don't follow these rules…

140
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,750
It's a ghost!

141
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,700
- Hey! 
 - Get lost! You psycho.

142
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,390
 Hey, you psycho. You psycho. 

143
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,940
Did you get scared?

144
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,190
Now, let's go to our room.

145
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,640
Okay.

146
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,220
Excuse me.

147
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,700
When will you pay me?

148
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,040
I need to pay for the Academy tuition.

149
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,420
Ju Won, why are you doing this to your friend?

150
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,130
I said, I will also pay you interest.

151
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,300
Wait a little longer.

152
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,840
- I need it by next week— 
 - Shut it! Seriously.

153
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,330
Are you a debt collector?

154
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,190
We're here to have fun. Why do you ask for money? F***…

155
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:04,030
Did you buy lottery tickets again?

156
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:11,610
Da Beom, did you also lend me money?

157
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,960
What?

158
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,140
Well, yes.

159
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,360
But you can take your time to pay me back.

160
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,970
I'm not in a rush.

161
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,780
How much is it in total?

162
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,470
I'll pay you.

163
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,660
How about…

164
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,110
a basketball match instead? Is it a deal?

165
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,010
   

166
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,600
I have to take the coding class.

167
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,860
   

168
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,130
Why isn't it working?

169
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,720
What are you doing?

170
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,250
You yelled at me for reading.

171
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:29,030
Who studies during a school trip?

172
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,000
Stop showing off that you're the best in class.

173
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,650
That's why they call you…

174
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:35,100
What was it? Mensa.

175
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:40,350
Mensa is the name of the organization. It's "Mensan" for people.

176
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,240
How many times did I tell you?

177
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:48,200
   

178
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,960
What's this?

179
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,460
I told you I don't need this.

180
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,490
I didn't do it.

181
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:12,290
   
   

182
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:19,760
   

183
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,950
What's this? 
    

184
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,810
I'm apparently a civilian.

185
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,460
- How about you? 
 - Me, too.

186
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,740
   

187
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,970
   

188
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,740
   

189
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,990
   

190
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,740
   

191
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:55,350
   

192
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,250
   

193
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,390
   

194
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,580
   

195
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,130
   

196
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,900
   

197
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:17,030
Ju Won, I'll make it quick.

198
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,240
Stand right there.

199
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,010
Here we go. 
    

200
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:25,810
   

201
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,080
Hold still. 
    

202
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,170
   

203
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,040
Mafia?

204
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,810
What is this?

205
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,640
What the fuck is this?

206
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:55,930
   

207
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,850
   

208
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:08,420
   

209
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:18,240
   

210
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,720
   

211
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,380
   

212
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,700
Is it my time to shine?

213
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,460
 Hi, losers. Let the game begin now. 
   

214
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,210
 Isn't Baek Eun Ha the mafia? 

215
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,110
He really loves it.

216
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:40,200
Hey. This is no good. Let's kill him.

217
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,640
Vote for him unanimously? Go for it?

218
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,160
 Go! 

219
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,060
Okay.

220
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,830
Heo Yul is the mafia.

221
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,540
Let's kill him.

222
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,450
Okay.

223
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,690
   

224
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,900
   

225
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,620
When you click a name, a vote is cast.

226
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,160
Really?

227
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,790
   

228
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,820
   

229
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,140
But… I didn't even sign up.

230
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,910
How do they know all of our names?

231
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,710
The internet isn't working, either.

232
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,320
How can we play the game?

233
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,500
What? Hasn't he come back yet?

234
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,250
The teacher left a long time ago.

235
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,880
Nothing could've happened, right?

236
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,760
What if he got into an accident?

237
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,650
Jun Hui, you don't know when the teacher is coming back, do you?

238
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,290
No, I don't know. I can't reach him.

239
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:56,710
Are your cell phones working?

240
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,810
No, they aren't.

241
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,660
Where is the staff?

242
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,330
I guess they all went with the teacher. There is no one else here.

243
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,310
What? So what do we do?

244
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,380
How long do we have to wait?

245
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,580
The office must have a phone. Let's check it out.

246
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,030
Okay.

247
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,320
It's not working.

248
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,050
The coffee hasn't been touched.

249
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,390
Have you really not seen anyone?

250
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:38,320
No, I haven't.

251
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,000
Hello?

252
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,870
It has been cut off.

253
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,810
Call the police, 119, or whatever.

254
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,220
Okay.

255
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,680
   

256
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,170
 Lee Yun Seo, come to the pool in the annex right now. It's urgent. 

257
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,060
Do you know what this is about?

258
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,040
Well, the thing is...

259
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,550
For tomorrow's event,

260
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,520
we're interviewing everyone and asking them about the trip.

261
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,040
Why would you interview in this situation?

262
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,170
Let's go.

263
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,250
Ju Won.

264
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,580
Where are you going?

265
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,440
Well, the guys wanted to see me for a second, so…

266
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,200
I will have a talk with Ju Won and join you guys.

267
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,780
Let's go.

268
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:58,600
It's okay. Let's go.

269
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,600
Here we go.

270
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,370
 A… 

271
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:17,290
 ce! 

272
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,750
Hey!

273
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,590
What are you guys doing?

274
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,690
Hey, Jin Da Beom. Get up.

275
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,710
Get up, I said.

276
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,560
Jeez.

277
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,810
- Go Gyeong Jun. 
 - Yes?

278
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,250
You're taking your prank too far.

279
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,770
What prank?

280
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,960
I'm freaking serious right now.

281
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,700
Da Beom agreed to help with the event tomorrow.

282
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,380
I can take him with me, right? We're leaving.

283
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,480
I-I…

284
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,270
I'm o-okay.

285
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,510
He's okay, apparently.

286
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,250
Gosh, you son of a bitch.

287
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:14,100
I hate how you act so superior because of your pretty face.

288
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,740
Shit. Who was that?

289
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,530
Seung Bin. You got rather big.

290
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,540
Have you been working out?

291
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:28,420
Shit, Jang Hyeon Ho. You son of a bitch.

292
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,400
Why are you all here acting like this?

293
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,350
We wanted to get some exercise.

294
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,710
Why?

295
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,270
Can't we do that?

296
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,790
You losers couldn't even get into the national team.

297
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:56,710
Fuck. Sure, go ahead. Work your asses off.

298
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,980
   

299
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,600
- Let's go. 
 - Those sons of bitches.

300
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,740
Jeez, those assholes. Seriously…

301
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,910
Don't, don't, don't.

302
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,810
Don't do it.

303
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,930
   

304
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,520
Are you okay?

305
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,860
Hide, hide, hide.

306
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,770
You're here. Go inside.

307
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,820
Wait, Yun Seo, you go inside first.

308
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,160
Okay.

309
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,360
They want to film Yun Seo first.

310
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,620
Let's go in a little later.

311
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,720
Can't we just be done with it?

312
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,230
Oh, my God!

313
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,970
Surprise.

314
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,710
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

315
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:09,060
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

316
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,840
♪  Happy birthday dear Yun Seo  ♪

317
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,070
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

318
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:17,520
Think of it as a candle and blow it out.

319
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,970
Since when have you been doing this kind of thing?

320
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:24,010
Most of the time you don't even talk to her.

321
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,010
Thank you.

322
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,710
Don't mention it.

323
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:31,460
We should celebrate. We are friends.

324
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,250
We also brought a present.

325
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,430
Let's give her a birthday beating.

326
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,550
What should we do?

327
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,600
Throw her. Throw her. Here we go. Here we go.

328
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,730
Stop!

329
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,710
- Should we throw her or not? 
 - Put her down. Put her down.

330
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,540
She's about to cry.

331
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,820
We've gone too far, haven't we?

332
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,960
Happy birthday.

333
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,970
Are you crazy? How could you push her?

334
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,400
Yun Seo, are you okay?

335
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,210
I-I'm okay.

336
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,290
Hurry, hurry.

337
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:20,210
- You go in. 
 - I can't go in there.

338
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,730
Lee Yun Seo.

339
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,640
Lee Yun Seo!

340
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,160
Hey, do something!

341
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,630
Sh*t.

342
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:16,350
Hurry. Help him. Help him. Hurry.

343
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,300
Yun Seo.

344
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,980
Lee Yun Seo!

345
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,670
Hurry and help me.

346
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,890
I think that we have gone a bit too far.

347
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:39,470
She'll be okay, right?

348
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,540
Yun Seo, are you okay?

349
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,410
Are you in any pain?

350
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:53,810
No, I'm okay.

351
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,860
Why are you sitting here like this?

352
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,550
You should have at least changed your clothes.

353
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:11,170
I was waiting for you to wake up.

354
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:14,560
Do you know how worried I was?

355
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,660
I was dying while I was waiting.

356
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,140
What exactly happened?

357
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,700
I don't know.

358
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,030
Are you okay now?

359
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,230
What?

360
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:37,390
You gave up swimming because you couldn't get in the water.

361
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,930
 Let go! 

362
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:43,280
 Seung Won! 

363
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,020
Oh, that?

364
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,540
I'm okay. I'm all better now.

365
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,310
Really?

366
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,660
I should gather everyone and talk to them.

367
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,970
You can rest here.

368
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,380
Okay.

369
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,260
Apologize to her right now.

370
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,700
A birthday beating?

371
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:16,770
Hey, you have gone too far with this one.

372
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,450
I'm sorry.

373
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:24,990
We really just wanted to wish you a happy birthday.

374
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:29,200
Well, it's okay. Don't cry.

375
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,110
Really? Will you forgive us?

376
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,430
Yes.

377
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,050
I'm sorry, Yun Seo.

378
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:42,440
It's really all right.

379
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,820
You better do this quickly.

380
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,940
Oh? They're here.

381
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,150
Class President, what should we do?

382
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,860
We can't reach the teacher. Our phones aren't working either.

383
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,700
I know. So what are we going to do?

384
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,950
Let's go back to our rooms and sleep for now.

385
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,490
I will be going out early in the morning or something.

386
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,080
Okay.

387
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,280
Guys! Go to your rooms and get some sleep.

388
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,080
Don't just hang around here.

389
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,010
Yes, let's go to sleep for now.

390
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,600
Jun Hui and I are going out tomorrow morning.

391
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,780
Go ahead. Go inside.

392
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,550
Okay, go inside.

393
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,850
Kim So Mi definitely faked crying when she said that.

394
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,610
Forget it. She said she was sorry.

395
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:41,640
She did that because you continue to tolerate her.

396
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,170
So what can I do about it?

397
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,000
I really don't like her.

398
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,560
Geez, we were supposed to hang out all night.

399
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,630
Do you feel like you want to in this situation?

400
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,480
Just go to bed.

401
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,130
 The voting ends in one minute. 

402
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:02,190
What is this? 
    

403
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,570
Wow, they even made an announcement.

404
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:10,080
It's so cool. Don't you agree?

405
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,050
Yes, I agree. But it was you who created this.

406
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,100
- No. 
 - Did you see it?

407
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,860
- Did you see it? 
 - Isn't that freakin' cool?

408
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,510
- It was him. 
 - No, that's not me.

409
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,790
Did you do it?

410
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:26,460
- Yes. 
 - Who did you vote for?

411
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,900
Heo Yul.

412
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,820
 The voting has ended. 

413
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,480
I'm sure everyone voted for him.

414
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,480
We know that this is all your doing anyway.

415
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,250
What are you talking about?

416
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,600
And why did you all vote for me in the first place?

417
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,910
Why are you making it so boring?

418
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,890
Come on.

419
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:50,680
 Heo Yul, the one with the most votes, will be executed. 

420
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,920
What is this?

421
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,380
Bye.

422
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:02,480
Gosh, he is begging for attention again.

423
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,850
That's enough.

424
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,310
Are you acting again?

425
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,470
It's not funny. Stop.

426
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:21,390
Hey, Yul. What's wrong?

427
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:30,310
Hey. What's wrong?

428
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,700
- Hey, are you okay? 
 - He's okay, right?

429
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,670
Yul! That's enough, I said.

430
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,720
Shit.

431
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,240
- What? 
 - Hey.

432
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,260
What's going on with him?

433
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,830
No!

434
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,280
Stop that!

435
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,930
Yul!

436
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,440
Yul!

437
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,780
Yul!

438
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,190
Yul!

439
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:42,120
Wh-What's going on?

440
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,040
Hey!

441
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:49,150
- No! 
 - Stop!

442
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,920
 Heo Yul was a civilian. 

443
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:07,490
- What? 
 - What's going on?

444
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:36,460


445
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:03,530
   

446
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:10,070
   

447
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:12,510
