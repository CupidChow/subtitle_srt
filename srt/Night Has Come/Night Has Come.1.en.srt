00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,740
(The police officer can find out the occupation of the participant of their choice)

182
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:55,250
(2. Starting at 8 a.m. to midnight, the participants)

183
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,250
(will select the mafia members through voting)

184
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:03,390
(3. At midnight, the participants with the most votes will get executed)

185
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,580
(and their occupation will be revealed)

186
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,030
(4. After the voting ends at midnight)

187
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,900
(all participants except for the mafia members will go to sleep)

188
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,930
Joo Won, I'll make it quick.

189
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,240
Stand right there.

190
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,010
Here we go.<br>(5. During the night, while the participants are asleep)

191
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:25,810
(by 6 a.m., the mafia must)

192
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,080
(execute someone themselves)<br>Hold still.

193
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,170
(The Mafia game starts now. Check your occupation now.)

194
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,040
The Mafia?

195
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,810
What's this?

196
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,640
What the f*** is this?

197
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:56,030
(6. When either team civilians or team mafia)

198
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,950
(kill all of the other team and win, it's game over)

199
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:08,420
(Civilians, the doctor, and the police officer are on the same team)

200
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:18,240
(Participants, please find the mafia and start voting now)

201
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,620
(Participants, please find the mafia and start voting now)

202
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,380
(Hi! Losers!)

203
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,700
Is it my time to shine?

204
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,460
(Let the game begin now)<br><i>Hi, losers. Let the game begin now.</i>

205
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,210
<i>Isn't Baek Eun Ah the mafia?</i>

206
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,110
He's really loving this.

207
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:40,200
Hey. This is no good. Let's kill him.

208
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,640
Vote for him unanimously? Go for it?

209
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,160
<i>Go!</i>

210
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,160
Okay.

211
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,930
Heo Yool is the mafia.

212
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,540
Let's kill him.

213
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,450
Okay.

214
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,690
(Will you vote for Heo Yool? / Yes)

215
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,620
If you push a name, a vote gets cast.

216
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,160
Really?

217
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,790
(Will you vote for Heo Yool? / Yes)

218
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,820
(Lee Yoon Seo voted for Heo Yool)

219
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,240
By the way, I didn't even sign up.

220
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,910
How do they know all of our names?

221
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,710
The internet isn't working, either.

222
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,320
How are we able to play the game?

223
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,600
What? He hasn't come yet?

224
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,250
The Teacher left a long time ago.

225
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,980
Nothing could've happened, right?

226
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,860
What if he got into an accident?

227
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,750
Joon Hee, you don't know when the Teacher is coming back, right?

228
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,390
No, I don't know because I can't reach him.

229
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,810
Are your phones working?

230
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,910
No, they aren't.

231
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,660
Where's the staff here?

232
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,430
I guess they all went with the Teacher. No one's here.

233
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,310
What? What do we do, then?

234
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,480
How long do we have to wait?

235
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,580
There must be a phone in the office. Let's check it out.

236
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,930
Okay.

237
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,220
It's not working.

238
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,050
The coffee hasn't been touched.

239
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,490
You really didn't see anyone?

240
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:38,320
No, I didn't.

241
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,000
Hello?

242
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,870
It cut off.

243
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,810
Call the police, 911, or whatever.

244
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,220
Okay.

245
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,170
<i>Lee Yoon Seo, come to the pool in the annex right now. It's urgent.</i>

246
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,060
Do you know what this is about?

247
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,040
Well, the thing is...

248
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,650
For the event tomorrow,

249
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,620
we're interviewing everyone and asking about the trip.

250
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,040
Why would you interview in this situation?

251
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,170
Let's go.

252
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,250
Joo Won.

253
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,580
Where are you going?

254
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,440
Well, the guys wanted to see me for a second. So...

255
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,200
I'll talk to Joo Won and join you.

256
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,780
Let's go.

257
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:58,600
It's okay. Let's go.

258
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,600
Here we go.

259
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,370
<i>A...</i>

260
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:17,290
<i>ce.</i>

261
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,750
Hey!

262
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,590
What are you guys doing?

263
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,690
Hey, Jin Da Beom. Get up.

264
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,710
Get up, I said.

265
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,760
Geez.

266
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,910
- Go Gyeong Joon.<br>- Huh?

267
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,250
You're taking your prank too far.

268
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,770
Prank?

269
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,060
I'm f***ing serious right now.

270
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,700
Da Beom agreed to help with the event tomorrow.

271
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,380
I can take him with me, right? We're leaving.

272
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,480
I-I...

273
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,270
I'm o-okay.

274
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,510
He's okay, apparently.

275
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,150
Gosh, you son of a bitch.

276
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,100
I hate how you act superior because of your pretty face.

277
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,740
Shit. Who was that?

278
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,530
Seung Bin. You got pretty big.

279
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,540
Have you been working out?

280
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:28,420
Shit, Jang Hyeon Ho. You son of a bitch.

281
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,400
Why are you all gathered here and flipping out?

282
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,040
We wanted to exercise.

283
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,710
Why?

284
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,370
Can't we?

285
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,790
You losers couldn't even get into the national team.

286
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:57,180
F***. Sure, work your asses off, then.

287
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,400
- Let's go.<br>- Those sons of bitches.

288
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,740
Geez, those assholes. Seriously...

289
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,910
Don't, don't, don't.

290
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,810
Don't do it.

291
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,420
Are you okay?

292
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,760
Hide, hide, hide.

293
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,770
You came. Go inside.

294
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,820
Wait, Yoon Seo, you go inside first.

295
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,160
Okay.

296
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,360
They want to shoot Yoon Seo first.

297
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,620
Let's go in a little later.

298
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,720
Can't we just be done with it?

299
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,230
Oh, my God!

300
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,970
Surprise.

301
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,710
♫ <i>Happy birthday to you</i> ♫

302
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:09,060
♫ <i>Happy birthday to you</i> ♫

303
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,840
♫ <i>Happy birthday dear Yoon Seo</i> ♫

304
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,270
♫ <i>Happy birthday to you</i> ♫

305
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,520
Think of it as a candle and blow it.

306
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,970
Since when have you done stuff like this?

307
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:24,010
You usually don't even talk to her.

308
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,010
Thank you.

309
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,710
Don't mention it.

310
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:31,460
We should celebrate since we're friends.

311
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,250
We brought a present, too.

312
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,430
Let's give her a birthday beating.

313
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,550
What should we do?

314
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,600
Throw her. Throw her. Here we go. Here we go.

315
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,730
Stop!

316
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,710
- Throw her or not?<br>- Put her down. Put her down.

317
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,540
She's about to cry.

318
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,820
We went too far, didn't we?

319
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,960
Happy birthday.

320
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,970
Are you crazy? How could you push her?

321
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,680
Yoon Seo, are you okay?

322
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,310
I-I'm okay.

323
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,390
Hurry, hurry.

324
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,510
- You go in.<br>- I can't go in there.

325
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,730
Lee Yoon Seo.

326
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,640
Lee Yoon Seo!

327
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,760
Hey, do something!

328
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,630
Shit.

329
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:16,350
Hurry. Help him. Help him. Hurry.

330
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,400
Yoon Seo.

331
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,980
Lee Yoon Seo!

332
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,670
Hurry up and help me.

333
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,890
I think we went a bit too far.

334
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:39,470
She'd be okay, right?

335
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,540
Yoon Seo, are you okay?

336
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,410
Are you in pain at all?

337
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:53,610
No, I'm okay.

338
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,860
Why are you sitting there like that?

339
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,550
You should've gotten changed, at least.

340
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:11,170
I waited to see you wake up.

341
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:14,560
Do you know how much I worried?

342
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,660
I thought you were dying.

343
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,140
What happened exactly?

344
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,700
I don't know.

345
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,130
Are you okay now?

346
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,330
What?

347
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:37,390
You quit swimming because you couldn't go in the water.

348
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,730
Let go!

349
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,480
Seung Won!

350
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,820
Oh, that?

351
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,640
I'm okay. I'm all better now.

352
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,210
Really?

353
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:52,660
I should gather everyone and talk.

354
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,970
Rest here.

355
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,380
Okay.

356
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:11,260
Apologize to her right now.

357
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,700
Birthday beating?

358
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:16,770
Hey. You went too far with it.

359
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,450
I'm sorry.

360
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:24,990
We really just wanted to wish you a happy birthday.

361
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:29,300
Well, it's okay. Don't cry.

362
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:33,110
Really? Will you forgive us?

363
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,430
Yes.

364
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,050
I'm sorry, Yoon Seo.

365
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:42,440
It's really okay.

366
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,820
You'd better do this quickly.

367
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,940
Oh? They're here.

368
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,250
Class President, what do we do?

369
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:03,860
We can't reach the teacher, and our phones aren't working, either.

370
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,700
I know. What do we do?

371
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,950
Let's sleep in our rooms for now.

372
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,590
I'll go out early in the morning or something.

373
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,080
Okay.

374
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,380
Guys! Go inside and go to sleep.

375
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,080
Don't just hang out here.

376
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,110
Yes, let's sleep for now.

377
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,600
Joon Hee and I will go out tomorrow morning.

378
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,780
Go ahead. Go inside.

379
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,650
Okay, go inside.

380
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,850
Kim So Mi definitely faked her tears.

381
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,610
Forget it. She said sorry.

382
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:41,540
She did that because you keep tolerating her.

383
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,770
What can I do, then?

384
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,500
Anyway, I don't like her.

385
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,660
Geez, we were supposed to hang out all night.

386
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,630
Do you feel like it in this situation?

387
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,280
Just go to bed.

389
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,690
What's this?

390
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,670
Wow, they're even making an announcement.

391
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,180
It's so cool. Don't you agree?

392
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,050
Yes, I agree. But you created this.

393
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,100
- No.<br>- Did you see it?

394
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,960
- Did you see it?<br>- Isn't it so freaking cool?

395
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,510
- It was him.<br>- No, it's not me.

396
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,790
Did you do it?

397
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:26,460
- Yes.<br>- Who did you vote?

398
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,900
Heo Yool.

400
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,480
I'm sure everyone voted for him.

401
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,580
We know you did this.

402
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,250
What are you talking about?

403
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,600
And why did you guys vote for me?

404
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,910
Why are you making it so boring?

405
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,790
Come on.

406
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:50,680
<i>Heo Yool, the one with the most votes, will be executed.</i>

407
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,920
What's this?

408
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,380
Bye.

409
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:02,480
Gosh, he's begging for attention again.

410
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,850
That's enough.

411
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,310
Are you acting again?

412
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,370
It's not funny. Stop.

413
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:20,790
Hey, Yool. What's wrong?

414
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:30,310
Hey. What's wrong?

415
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,700
- Hey, are you okay?<br>- He's okay, right?

416
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,670
Yool. That's enough, I said.

417
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,520
Shit.

418
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,540
- What?<br>- Hey.

419
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,430
No!

420
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,180
Stop that!

421
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,830
Yool.

422
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,440
Yool!

423
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,280
Yool!

424
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,190
Yool.

425
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:42,120
W-What's going on?

426
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,040
Hey!

427
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:48,850
- No!<br>- Stop!
