Hurry!

00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,430
This is the wrong one!

10
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,080
Na Hui!

11
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,920
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

12
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,820
- Do you have your phone? 
 - No.

13
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,250
- What about you? 
 - Me, neither.

14
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,580
 Where is my phone? 

15
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,960
Hurry and find your phone!

16
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,350
- What about yours? 
 - I found mine.

17
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,600
Let's hurry and find yours!

18
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:35,430

20
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,470

22
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,690

23
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:06,010
G-Guys, we have to vote! Vote, or we'll die!

24
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,720
Who do we fucking vote for? Huh?

25
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,840
Who do we vote for?

26

27

28
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,690
- Found it! 
 - You found it?

29
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,510
- What about you? 
 - You vote first!

30
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,270
- I'll look somewhere else. 
 - What?

31
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,690
Hyeon Ho!

32
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,000
It's yours.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,440
- Give it to me. 
 - Get lost, you son of a bitch!

34
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,980
Shit! You motherfucker!

35
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,850

00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,620
 Baek Eun Ha has voted for Kim So Mi. 

42
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,920

Hyeon Ho! Hyeon Ho, I'll do it.

50
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,990
Jun Hui, I found your phone. Hurry and vote.

51
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,060
Hurry!

52
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,960
What about the others? We need to find Yun Seo's phone, too.

53
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,280
I'll find it, so hurry and vote first!

 Cha Yu Jun has voted for Baek Eun Ha. 

55

56
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,070
It's Baek Eun Ha anyway. We will die if we don't vote.

57
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,920
She'll get all the votes if we vote, too.

58
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,570
Then what do you suggest?

59
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,570
We can split the votes.

60
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,040
Each of us has to vote for someone else.

61
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,080
You two vote for each other!

62
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,270
Jun Hui... Kim Jun Hui...

63
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,570
We just need to vote for each other. Okay?

64
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,090
 - Jin Da Beom...  
 - Hurry!

65
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,470

71
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:16,290
  - Jang Hyeon Ho will be executed for violating the rules.  
 - Hurry and vote for me!

72
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,540
Hyeon Ho!

73
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,980
Hyeon Ho!

74
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,770
Hyeon Ho!

75
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,480
Hyeon Ho!

76
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,790
 Jang Hyeon Ho was a civilian. 

77
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,160
 The voting has ended. 

78
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,460
 By popular vote of ten votes, Baek Eun Ha will be executed. 

79
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,890
 Baek Eun Ha is a civilian. 

80
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,280
I told you I was a civilian!

81
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,410
I told you I wasn't the mafia!

82
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,490
I said I wasn't!

83
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,340
Why me?

84
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,640
Why?

85
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,060
   

86
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,630
 Night has come. 

87
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,390
   

88
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,030
Ju Yeong.

89
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,900
Ju Yeong...

90
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,030
Hey...

91
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,210
Ju Yeong.

92
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,510
Hey, Lee Ju Yeong!

93
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,510
What's wrong?

94
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,520
Something's wrong with J-Ju Yeong.

95
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,710
   

96
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:21,220
 Lee Ju Yeong was executed by the mafia last night. 

97
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,580
 Lee Ju Yeong was a civilian. 

98
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:30,200
 Before the previous voting ended, the doctor chose to use his healing ability 

99
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,100
 on Cha Yu Jun. 

100
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,030
 Morning has come. 

101
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:45,110
 All participants, please find the mafia and begin voting. 

102
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,020
I think she was strangled with this.

103
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,330
I told you I didn't want to hand in my phone!

104
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,250
I said I didn't want to!

105
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,780
We wouldn't have slept here if we hadn't collected the phones.

106
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,540
And no one would've died.

107
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,580
You killed them all, Kim Jun Hui. Take responsibility!

108
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,470
That's enough.

109
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,890
If Hyeon Ho had voted sooner,

110
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,070
he wouldn't have died, either.

111
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:21,160
They're not wrong.

112
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,020
We survived because we were lucky.

113
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,550
How will you and Go Gyeong Jun take responsibility?

114
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,820
Did I fucking suggest we should collect them?

115
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,670
Kim Jun Hui, you son of a bitch! You said we only had to collect the phones!

116
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,820
We all ended up like this because of you.

117
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,140
Take responsibility!

118
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,920
I'm sorry...

119
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,630
 The game has to be played within the designated area. 

120
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,110
 The game has to be played within the designated area. 

121
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,330
Whatever. This happened because of the Class President.

122
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,490
Let's just vote for him today.

123
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:51,360
You're the one who took all our phones, saying it was a good idea.

124
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,840
Why are you acting like you didn't?

125
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,960
You were quite relaxed last night.

126
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,860
Why did you secretly keep your phone?

127
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,750
You're the most suspicious one here.

128
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,430
Hey...

129
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,320
isn't it obvious?

130
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,340
How should I trust Kim Jun Hui, that bastard? He might be the mafia.

131
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,430
Hey!

132
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,330
This is a game of life or death.

133
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:26,540
Why should I put my life in someone else's hands? I just used my brain.

134
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,710
I just used my brain. If I hadn't, I could've died.

135
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,990
Hey,

136
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,280
that's enough. Please.

137
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,740
Do you really want to argue in this situation?

138
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:45,230
How long will you argue over a game that kills people?

139
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,930
Don't you want to go home?

140
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,240
How can we go home?

141
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,120
We can't escape.

142
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,590
If we can find out who created

143
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:59,560
the mafia game and why, we can figure out how to get out of here.

144
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,350
Then we can all get out of here, and no one will have to die.

145
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,010
We can figure that out later.

146
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,560
Let's move them first.

147
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,600
Move what?

148
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,880
We can't leave them like this.

149
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,910
We need to move them to a freezer.

150
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,960
Hey, Go Gyeong Jun!

151
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,870
Let go, you crazy bitch.

152
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,680
Don't leave.

153
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,260
You guys help, too.

154
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,930
Everyone should help if we're doing this.

155
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,840
Are you slipping away again, y-you cheapskate?

156
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,710
What did you say?

157
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,000
I shouldn't have collected the phones.

158
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,730
It's not your fault.

159
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,670
We didn't know there was a rule like that.

160
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,260
No...

161
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,970
It's all because of me.

162
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,810
Kim Jun Hui,

163
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:33,330
people will keep dying until the game truly ends.

164
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,550
If you really want to take responsibility,

165
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:41,720
think about how you can get these kids out of here as soon as possible.

166
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,190
Okay?

167
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,160
Okay.

168
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,120
   

169
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,780
   

170
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,950
Yun Seo!

171
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,890
- Yun Seo, what's wrong? 
 - Yoon Seo!

172
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,610
Yun Seo!

173
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,570
Are you okay?

174
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,810
The inhaler!

175
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,340
- Yun Seo! 
 - Are you okay?

176
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,170
Breathe! Breathe.

177
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,010
Are you okay?

178
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,910
Yun Seo. Yun Seo!

179
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:45,230
Yun Seo, are you okay?

180
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,810
What happened?

181
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,300
You probably don't remember.

182
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,310
You fainted earlier.

183
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:55,040
You don't know how scared we were.

184
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,530
I'm all right.

185
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:03,020
Are you wrapping your bandage? I'll help you.

186
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,490
Why did the kids have to die?

187
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,440
Na Hui...

188
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,920
Hyeon Ho was helping me...

189
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,040
Why do we have to go through this?

190
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,350
Let's come clean.

191
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,740
Speak up if you're the mafia.

192
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,030
Would you speak up if it were you?

193
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,990
F*** you.

194
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,730
Then let's do it again.

195
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,560
Who do you think is definitely the mafia?

196
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:05,400
The police should at least speak up. Police!

197
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,260
Come clean!

198
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:13,300
I don't think the police will speak up, either.

199
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,360
Of course, they won't.

200
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:20,430
Damn, why won't anyone freaking cooperate?

201
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,190
Hey, Class President. It's you, isn't it?

202
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,010
You didn't let us vote, so all the civilians died.

203
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,950
It was the mafia's scheme to kill civilians, wasn't it?

204
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,800
What are you saying?

205
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,900
Didn't you see the notice?

206
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,110
Civilians weren't the only ones who died. The mafia died, too.

207
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:44,120
At least we can guess who the doctor is.

208
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,570
It's not me!

209
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,310
It's not me, either.

210
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,670
It is you two.

211
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,170
Who else would save Cha Yu Jun if not you two?

212
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:04,290
I don't know why they used it on me, either, but it really isn't me!

213
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,960
   

214
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,140
Hey, Kim So Mi.

215
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,310
Eun Ha said you were the mafia yesterday.

216
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,310
Did you choose her because she exposed you?

217
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,890
Hey, I...

218
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:36,630
I had no choice but to choose her since she tried to vote for me!

219
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,150
What about you? Are you the mafia?

220
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,510
Wh-What about me?

221
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,410
Ju Yeong,

222
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,710
you two had a big argument yesterday.

223
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,560
An argument is an argument!

224
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,610
Why would I kill her over that?

225
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:58,470
You acted like a maid in front of Ju Yeong

226
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,250
but cursed her behind her back, saying she was annoying.

227
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,870
Maybe you wanted to kill her.

228
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,960
T-That's not true!

229
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,710
I guess Lee Ju Yeong did keep bossing Choi Mi Na around.

230
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,640
I said that's not true!

231
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,580
You talk too freaking much.

232
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,860
Come clean before you see blood.

233
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,530
Go Gyeong Jun.

234
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,470
Why did you do that then?

235
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,940
Do what, you fucker?

236
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,090
Why were you the only one who hid your phone?

237
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,730
You knew the kids would die if we didn't vote,

238
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,640
and you kept quiet so they would all die, huh?

239
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,360
I told you...

240
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,980
how could I trust that bastard?

241
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,520
Why did you force us to trust him when you couldn't?

242
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,270
You're the one who killed Lee Ju Yeong, you bastard.

243
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,290
Did you think I didn't know?

244
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,050
What?

245
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:20,650
You were shit on online after you confessed your feelings to Lee Ju Yeong and got rejected.

246
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:25,040
- Ju Yeong and I were just joking 
 - Stop bullshitting, you dumbass!

247
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,050
You got on your knees and begged Lee Ju Yeong to take it down.

248
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,760
Is there anyone here who doesn't know about that?

249
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,040
Hey, Choi Mi Na! Speak up. You recorded that.

250
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,290
Y-Yes...

251
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,130
How does that matter right now?

252
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:45,090
It fucking matters since you're the mafia, you asshole!

253
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:48,520
You trashed Lee Ju Yeong behind her back, calling her a sly fox.

254
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,480
You killed Choi Ju Won first since it would be obvious

255
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,170
if you killed Lee Ju Yeong right away, didn't you?

256
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,410
That's not true.

257
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:58,530
H-How could I be the mafia? I-It's you!

258
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,790
Fuck you.

259
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,400
Damn.

260
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,730
 Go Gyeong Jun has voted for Park Wu Ram. 

261
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,940
I'm not! Don't do it!

262
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,700
- I can tell from his eyes. He's the mafia. 
 - Hey, hey! Hey!

263
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,510
Hey, hey! Hey!

264
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,240
   

265
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,340
 Shin Seung Bin and Kim Jin Ha 

266
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,870
 have voted for Park Wu Ram. 

267
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,590
Hey, you sons of bitches!

268
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,130
Hurry and vote for this bastard, too.

269
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,970
Hey, Choi Mi Na! This bastard is pretty pissed with you, too.

270
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:50,310
Since Lee Ju Yeong died, it's your turn today.

271
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:59,400
Hey. Hey, Go Gyeong Jun!

272
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,190
Move!

273
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:09,330
How dare the motherfucker try to kill me?

274
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:20,230
Hey, you don't think they'll turn against us, do you?

275
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,240
That's nonsense.

276
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,360
There are fifteen people left.

277
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,740
Even if the three of us vote for Park Wu Ram,

278
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,810
a lot more kids haven't voted yet.

279
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,380
Fuck, should we get insurance?

280
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,690
Hey, where are you going? Hey!

281
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,940
Guys...

282
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,400
Guys, where are you going?

283
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,090
Hey!

284
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,070
Wait, wait!

285
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,710
We should talk before you go.

286
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:20,080
We can gather after a little rest.

287
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,570
What?

288
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,390
   

289
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,830
 Choi Mi Na has voted for Park Wu Ram. 

290
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,560
Choi Mi Na!

291
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,270
What the hell?

292
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,720
What?

293
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:57,180
When I thought about it, Go Gyeong Jun has a valid point.

294
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,940
No wonder...

295
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,940
The way he was looking at Ju Yeong yesterday was freaking off.

296
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:10,000
- What? 
 - That crazy bitch!

297
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,440
Hey, Wu Ram!

298
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,860
Don't. I'll convince her.

299
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,340
Aren't you hungry?

300
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,090
Hey, Ji Su!

301
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,890
You're really not a doctor, right?

302
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,820
I'm not.

303
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,180
I know. I trust you.

304
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:06,360
- But who in the world– 
 - I said, I'm really not!

305
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,620
- Trust me. 
 - Yu Jun,

306
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,400
I'm really confused right now.

307
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,640
What's going on?

308
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,850
What happened?

309
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,660
Go Gyeong Jun got the better of us.

310
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,820
I should've stopped them from voting.

311
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,600
Even if you had, would they have listened?

312
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,880
Instead of sitting here like this,

313
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,840
shouldn't we at least ask the others to vote for someone else?

314
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,540
Whom would you suggest they vote for?

315
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,690
I don't know!

316
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,860
As long as it's not one of us.

317
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:53,120
We just need to know who the mafia is.

318
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,620
Do you think they wouldn't vote for you just because you saved Park Wu Ram?

319
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,830
They'll do whatever it takes to stay alive.

320
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,420
The fact that Baek Eun Ha got targeted,

321
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,730
Park Wu Ram and Kim So Mi made that happen.

322
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,810
You should get revenge.

323
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:20,110
Hey, we need to stick together.

324
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:25,320
You even get a free pass to the snack bar. How great is this?

325
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,880
Well?

326
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:37,210
Park Wu Ram, that bastard, is definitely the mafia.

327
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:42,240
He's getting upset because he's damn guilty of something.

328
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,640
Eat.

329
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,740
Hey, eat up. It's going to get soggy.

330
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:06,270
  
  

331
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,360
What the hell is this?

332
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,810
- What's with them? 
 - These bastards...

333
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:14,860
How could they do this to me? Huh?

334
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:22,020
Yes, Ji Su and Yu Jun are on our side.

335
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,430
It'll be all right. Don't worry.

336
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,590
I'll find a way.

337
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,920
Okay?

338
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,050
A way?

339
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:34,470
Fuck!

340
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,930
There's no other choice.

341
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:40,950
It's either Go Gyeong Jun or me now.

342
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:44,700
One of us has to die for this to end. Am I wrong?

343
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,930
Let's do the same thing as him.

344
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,970
Let's vote for Go Gyeong Jun.

345
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,240
What?

346
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,590
He's always harassing the kids.

347
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:01,410
That son of a bitch deserves to die.

348
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,050
That bastard will do anything to stay alive.

349
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:15,560
Fine, let's say it's me today. What about tomorrow?

350
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,290
Who will he choose tomorrow?

351
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:19,730
It's one of you guys!

352
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,110
Is it Go Gyeong Jun or me?

353
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,940
Make your choice.

354
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,850
Wu Ram is right.

355
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,050
I'll vote for Go Gyeong Jun.

356
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,800
Me, too.

357
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,230
Judging by his actions yesterday, he's no good.

358
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,250
I'll vote for him, too.

359
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,470
Guys...

360
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,520
Guys.

361
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,790
If you don't help me, I'm going to die.

362
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:04,970
Are you going to kill me? Please...

363
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,130
Please help me, will you?

364
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:17,000
   
   

365
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,200
   

366
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,700
   

367
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,470
See?

368
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:33,100
I knew this would happen. Shit.

369
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:41,720
That crazy bastard has a death wish.

370
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:47,080
Only Yu Jun and Ji Su are left, right?

371
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,170
Yes, they should be in their room.

372
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,710
Okay.

373
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:58,240
You guys should rest since you're not feeling well.

374
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,190
I'll go.

375
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:08,780
Want to go to the infirmary?

376
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:11,200
It's a bit scary here.

377
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,760
Must you go inside?

378
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,800
We don't even know what's there.

379
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,360
All the more reason to.

380
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,980
I'll be quick.

381
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,800
Yun Seo...

382
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,830
be careful.

383
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,940
Okay.

384
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,450
Hey, Lee Yun Seo!

385
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,580
Yun Seo!

386
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,810
Are you okay?

387
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,790
Lee Yun Seo!

388
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:02,710
   

389
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,160
   

390
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,660
   

391
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:29,000
