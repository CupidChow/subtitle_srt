1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,540
However

2
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,840
That promise is instrumented

3
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,360
Don't care for your seat

4
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,840
To see his win

5
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,200
We all know

6
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,820
that I'll never stop

7
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,240
In infidelity

8
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:17,880
Which can handle a few

9
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,500
Make Zi marries

10
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,140
Extra

11
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,440
My dear

12
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,200
Relationships

13
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,580
Appear

14
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,380
Please

15
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:26,940
Instant

16
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,600
blindly

17
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,600
Episode 16

18
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,320
Miss A-Sou is drunk.

19
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,840
We should send her back.

20
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,040
I haven't finished drinking.

21
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,400
If you still have something to do,

22
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,400
just continue.

23
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,520
I'll send her away.

24
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,560
I...

25
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,520
I can still drink.

26
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,480
I'm not drunk.

27
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,520
Hurry up. Come here.

28
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,640
I'm not drunk.

29
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,400
Thank you for sending our Miss A-Sou back.

30
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,640
Miss A-Sou is drunk.

31
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,040
Take good care of her.

32
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,560
That guy...

33
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,880
He's not drunk.

34
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,920
He's not still drinking, right?

35
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,000
Here.

36
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,200
Sir.

37
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,760
Where is the mansion?

38
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,240
Do you need to be sent back?

39
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,680
Mansion?

40
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,920
Home?

41
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,360
They left me behind.

42
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,840
I'm not going back.

43
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,840
Let's go.

44
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,880
You're still young.

45
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,120
Why do you have to be so sad?

46
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,960
Go back early.

47
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,160
You'll forget everything after a nap.

48
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,600
She won't talk to me when I go back.

49
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,320
We've always been

50
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,840
best friends.

51
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,560
We agreed to live and die together.

52
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,560
You're a liar.

53
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,720
You don't even talk.

54
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,640
Liar.

55
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,800
You must have done something

56
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,600
that you're sorry for your friend.

57
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,480
I shouldn't have guessed her.

58
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,280
It's fate to meet people.

59
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,680
You should cherish it.

60
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,840
Life is unpredictable.

61
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,200
It's enough to have a close friend.

62
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,560
Especially,

63
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,440
you're a good friend.

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,040
It's even more valuable.

65
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,880
Valuable?

66
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,720
It's okay if you misunderstand.

67
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,720
Just talk to each other.

68
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,640
Close friend.

69
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,800
I really want to be her friend.

70
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,360
Brother Tao.

71
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,760
Brother Jiang, here.

72
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,120
How is it?

73
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,320
I just picked it.

74
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
Brother Xing.

75
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,080
How did I come back last night?

76
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,880
Brother E'erhe sent you back.

77
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,600
You should drink good wine in the future.

78
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,320
Don't drink that wine every day.

79
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,600
It'll hurt your body the most.

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,320
I see.

81
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,680
But she...

82
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,760
She sent you back last night.

83
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,440
Let's go.

84
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,120
Here.

85
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,000
Was it you who sent me home last night?

86
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,560
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,200
I drank too much and I don't remember anything.

88
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,240
Thanks a lot.

89
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,280
We have to send them all out

90
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,760
So won't it take too much effort

91
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,240
This

92
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,160
No need

93
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,480
A torture

94
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,400
Let'sJohn

95
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:48,920
This

96
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,080
No, no

97
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,000
We must go now

98
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:55,920
So do we

99
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,160
to collect each and everyone present

100
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,280
Great

101
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,780
Nice

102
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,300
Good shot

103
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,060
Great

104
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,060
Good.

105
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,060
Good.

106
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,060
Good.

107
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,060
Good.

108
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,060
Good.

109
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,060
Good.

110
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,060
Good.

111
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,060
Good.

112
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,060
Good.

113
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,060
Good.

114
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,060
Good.

115
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,060
Good.

116
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,060
So good.

117
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,060
Not good.

118
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,060
So good.

119
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,060
Not good.

120
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,060
Not good.

121
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,060
What's wrong?

122
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,060
Tomorrow's

123
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,060
Gao Mei's wedding banquet

124
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,060
and Li Bei's revenge

125
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,060
will be held tomorrow.

126
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,060
Li Bei's revenge.

127
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,060
Prince Chong and his wife

128
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,060
are coming.

129
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,060
Prince Chong is coming?

130
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,060
What's wrong?

131
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,060
Yes.

132
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,060
I heard that

133
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,060
they are not close.

134
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,060
Gao Mei Ji is just

135
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,060
a former disciple of the ten ancestors

136
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,060
of the Eastern Realm.

137
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,060
Although they have been invited

138
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,060
to help the princes of the dukes,

139
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,060
they often come to the banquet.

140
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,060
They are just emissaries.

141
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,060
This time, the duke of the Northern State

142
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,060
came to attend the banquet in person.

143
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,060
I wonder what he is thinking.

144
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,060
Dong Lu's matter

145
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,060
with the princes' camp

146
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,060
is at the peak of the storm.

147
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,060
Anyway,

148
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,060
you'd better be careful.

149
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,060
I'm sorry.

150
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,060
The princes of the dukes

151
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,060
came from afar

152
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,060
and came here to welcome you.

153
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,060
No wonder.

154
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,060
General Jiang, you're welcome.

155
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,060
We are not like Dong Lu in the Northern State.

156
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,060
We don't pay attention to these false details.

157
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,060
The wedding banquet of Gao Mei Ji

158
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,060
is a small matter in the Eastern Realm.

159
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,060
How can I trouble you

160
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,060
to come to the banquet in person?

161
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,060
I came here

162
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,060
to do something more important

163
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,060
besides the wedding banquet of Gao Mei Ji.

164
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,060
General Jiang, have you forgotten

165
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,060
that the Emperor Chong Ying Biao

166
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,060
is still in charge of the banquet?

167
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,060
As your brother,

168
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,060
I just want to visit you.

169
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,060
I wonder if you

170
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,060
don't welcome me.

171
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,060
Of course I do.

172
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,060
I'm very welcome.

173
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,060
I'm very happy to see you.

174
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,060
The dukes have prepared the banquet

175
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,060
to welcome you.

176
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,060
Please, Your Highness.

177
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,060
Miss A'Si.

178
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,060
Are you Miss A'Si?

179
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,060
Why are you here?

180
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,060
What a coincidence!

181
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,060
I live in the Eastern Marquis Mansion

182
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,060
and live in Gao Mei Ji.

183
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,060
I'm here

184
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,060
because of General Jiang's invitation.

185
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,060
Your clothes...

186
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,060
Why is your face so red?

187
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,060
But your body is not...

188
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,060
A'Si.

189
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,060
Miss A'Si

190
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,060
is really clean and well-mannered today.

191
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,060
She is very beautiful.

192
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,060
Mr. Deshun, you're too kind.

193
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,060
Yes, I'm a little too kind.

194
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,060
Right, A'Si?

195
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,060
Look at your face.

196
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,060
Even Mr. Deshun

197
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,060
doesn't want to talk to you.

198
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,060
Right, A'Si?

199
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,060
Let's go.

200
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,060
Li A'Si.

201
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,060
Don't be so unreasonable.

202
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,060
Wait for me.

203
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,060
Let go of me.

204
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,060
Run! Run!

205
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,060
The banquet is about to start.

206
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,060
Listen to me.

207
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,060
This Nüfei is running fast.

208
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,060
Run!

209
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,060
This woman is really

210
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,060
the sister-in-law of Chong Yi Biao.

211
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,060
The Crown Princess of the North Marquis.

212
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,060
Not bad.

213
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,060
I, the Crown Prince, on behalf of the North,

214
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,060
wish the ceremony of the Eastland High-Mirror Festival

215
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,060
to be held smoothly.

216
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,060
The dance of the inner son

217
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,060
is the most high-class dance of the North.

218
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,060
It's a tribute.

219
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,060
The Crown Prince has come from afar

220
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,060
to show his gratitude to the Eastland.

221
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,060
He ordered his wife to present this dance

222
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,060
to make the Eastland Marquis

223
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,060
more proud.

224
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,060
That's right.

225
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,060
The Crown Princess is both talented and handsome.

226
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,060
She is a rare beauty.

227
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,060
The Crown Prince didn't want his wife

228
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,060
to perform a dance for us.

229
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,060
It's really a great blessing.

230
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,060
That's right.

231
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,060
The Crown Princess's dance

232
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,060
is really something we haven't seen before.

233
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,060
That's right.

234
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,060
It's really a blessing.

235
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,060
That's right.

236
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,060
The dance of the Eastland High-Mirror Festival

237
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,060
Brother,

238
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,060
you haven't seen your wife for a long time.

239
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,060
Have you ever missed your wife's dance?

240
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,060
The dance of the Eastland High-Mirror Festival

241
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,060
is a great blessing.

242
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,060
The Crown Princess is both talented and handsome.

243
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:28,060
She is a rare beauty.

244
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,060
That's really a blessing.

245
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,060
The Crown Prince is really blessed

246
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,060
to have such a good wife.

247
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,060
Your Highness, a toast to you.

248
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,060
Thank you for your gift, Your Highness.

249
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,060
The banquet has begun.

250
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,060
Please enter the banquet.

251
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,060
Will Chong Yiwu

252
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,060
really follow our plan?

253
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,060
The hatred between them

254
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,060
has never been resolved.

255
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,060
As long as Chong Yiwu is alive,

256
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,060
he will definitely disturb the Crown Prince's peace.

257
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,060
Are you sure?

258
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,060
Of course.

259
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,060
The first toast to you tonight

260
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,060
is to General Jiang.

261
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,060
But the second toast

262
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,060
is to...

263
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,060
the savior of Chong Yiwu,

264
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,060
Prince Shun.

265
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,060
What?

266
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,060
If you are not good at it,

267
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,060
you don't have to be polite.

268
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,060
You may not know that

269
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,060
on the day of my wedding,

270
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,060
the snake emperor Chong Yingbiao

271
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,060
stabbed me in the back.

272
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,060
He asked me to save him

273
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,060
before I escaped.

274
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,060
Could it be that

275
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,060
Chong Yiwu was the one

276
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,060
who hurt his chest?

277
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,060
No wonder Chong Yiwu

278
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,060
was always against him.

279
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,060
So, he is such a good man.

280
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,060
How could he bear

281
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,060
such a deep hatred?

282
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:10,060
Please, Brother Shun.

283
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,060
Since you are so nostalgic,

284
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,060
do you still remember

285
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,060
the promise I made to you

286
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,060
on the day of my wedding?

287
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,060
If you are to return to the throne again,

288
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,060
the Nanbo House of Fire

289
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:31,060
will be yours forever.

290
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,060
May I ask you,

291
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,060
is the trade route of Libei

292
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,060
still in order?

293
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,060
I have been waiting for you

294
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,060
for a long time.

295
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:46,060
Is the trade route still in order?

296
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,060
It is true that all these years,

297
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,060
you are the one who

298
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:54,060
set up Libei.

299
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,060
It seems that the snake emperor

300
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,060
is not cruel enough to cut your knife.

301
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,060
The evil snake emperor

302
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,060
is still so worried about him.

303
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,060
Why do I think

304
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,060
your kindness

305
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,060
is being treated as a donkey's liver?

306
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,060
You are just doing

307
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,060
what you want to do.

308
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,060
You are just doing what you want to do.

309
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,060
It has nothing to do with others.

310
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,060
As for the trade route of Libei,

311
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,060
as long as it doesn't work,

312
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,060
I'm afraid you can't

313
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,060
really make it in Libei.

314
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,060
You...

315
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,060
Even though you saved my life,

316
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,060
why did you

317
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,060
get so angry?

318
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,060
Please go back to the wedding.

319
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:34,060
Wait!

320
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,060
It was Childe Jiang.

321
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,060
You reminded me of something.

322
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,060
Since you saved my life,

323
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,060
you should use Libei

324
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,060
to treat the guests with the highest etiquette.

325
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,060
Come on!

326
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:50,060
Bring the wine!

327
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,060
The dragon tiger is too big.

328
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,060
I've never heard of this rule.

329
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,060
Such a big wine cup for drinking,

330
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,060
isn't it just one cup?

331
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,060
It's obviously a miscarriage.

332
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,060
In our Libei,

333
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,060
treating the guests

334
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,060
with the dragon tiger,

335
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,060
wine and wine

336
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,060
is considered a miscarriage.

337
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,060
Oh no!

338
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:15,060
How can he drink so much?

339
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:20,060
Please, Brother Xian.

340
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,060
What?

341
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,060
After you hit the trade route,

342
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,060
you can't even drink?

343
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,060
I didn't expect Brother E's ability to drink.

344
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,060
I don't think I can drink

345
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,060
such a big bottle of wine.

346
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:47,060
Can Brother E's body hold it?

347
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:52,060
Brother E's wine is really good.

348
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,060
This is the second cup.

349
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:59,060
Please.

350
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,060
Wait!

351
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,060
Wait!

352
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,060
Your Highness.

353
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,060
No need.

354
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,060
Brother Xian's body is very hard.

355
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,060
The last cup.

356
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,060
Please.

357
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,060
Wait!

358
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,060
The rule of Libei.

359
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,060
The third cup can be treated.

360
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,060
Isn't that right, Brother?

361
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,060
I drank Brother Xian's wine.

362
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,060
I think he received the thank you gift.

363
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,060
It's almost enough.

364
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:33,060
Wait!

365
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:36,060
You drank Brother's wine.

366
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,060
But you haven't drunk

367
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:45,060
your sister-in-law's wine.

368
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,060
Xing'er.

369
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,060
Come and toast to me.

370
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,060
Xing'er.

371
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,060
What are you waiting for?

372
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,060
What are you waiting for?

373
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,060
Come and toast to me.

374
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,060
Please, Brother.

375
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,060
My good brother.

376
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,060
You didn't drink this cup of wine.

377
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,060
You really let your sister-in-law down.

378
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,060
After all, all these years,

379
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,060
she has been thinking about you.

380
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:20,060
Xing'er, toast to her.

381
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,060
Second Young Master, please.

382
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,060
Brother Chong's clothes are wet.

383
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,060
Go back and change.

384
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,060
This family's wine.

385
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,060
It won't be too late to drink again.

386
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,060
Everyone, look.

387
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:56,060
Everyone, look.

388
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,060
Everyone, open your eyes and look.

389
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,060
What is this?

390
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,060
Why is there a name of Chong Yibiao on this handkerchief?

391
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,060
Could it be that her sister-in-law and her husband

392
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,060
really have a relationship?

393
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,060
This is a great loss.

394
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,060
Yes.

395
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,060
Give it back to me.

396
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,060
Give it back to me.

397
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,060
You can't get on the stage.

398
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,060
You humiliated me.

399
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,060
How can you hit a woman?

400
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:18,060
Young Master, this is my wine.

401
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,060
This is not appropriate for your wife.

402
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,060
General Jiang, I teach my wife family affairs.

403
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,060
General Jiang insists on interfering.

404
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,060
I'm afraid it's not good.

405
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,060
Young Master, it's not like that.

406
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,060
Then what is this?

407
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,060
How dare you use this kind of thing

408
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,060
to dirty my eyes?

409
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,060
Don't think that by using a few colors,

410
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,060
you can cover your own background

411
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,060
by marrying into our North Marquis's mansion.

412
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,060
The first beauty

413
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,060
is just a dance machine

414
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,060
on the grassland.

415
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,060
As expected,

416
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:56,060
you are a bitch.

417
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,060
You just like to do this kind of

418
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,060
dirty and dirty things.

419
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,060
Since there are some things that you can't get rid of,

420
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,060
why do you have to search for them?

421
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,060
For example,

422
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,060
you are destined to marry someone you love.

423
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,060
You are trying to hide it again.

424
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,060
You are a couple of dogs.

425
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,060
You are born to be a bitch.

426
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,060
Enough!

427
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,060
What? You feel bad?

428
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,060
I hit my own woman.

429
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,060
How dare you stop me?

430
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,060
Say it again.

431
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:42,060
I said you are a bitch.

432
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,060
Good job!

433
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:48,060
Chong Yibiao, stop it.

434
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,060
Chong Yibiao,

435
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,060
stop right there!

436
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,060
Chong Yibiao!

437
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,060
Chong Yibiao!

438
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,060
Chong Yibiao!

439
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,060
Stop right there!

440
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,060
Great.

441
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,060
I've waited for so long, and finally I can do it.

442
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,060
My good brother,

443
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:22,060
do you want to kill me very early?

444
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,060
You and that bitch,

445
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,060
you all want to kill me?

446
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,060
If I die,

447
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,060
you can take the throne.

448
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,060
Don't think I don't know

449
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:40,060
that you and her colluded in secret.

450
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,060
You want to take the throne.

451
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,060
Chong Yibiao,

452
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,060
you always want to kill your brother.

453
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,060
You are not a bitch.

454
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,060
I should be punished.

455
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,060
Shut up!

456
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,060
Chong Yibiao,

457
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,060
stop right there!

458
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,060
You want me to shut up,

459
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:12,060
but everyone knows that your mother

460
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,060
is a slave of that despicable man.

461
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,060
She used those dirty tricks to seduce my father.

462
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,060
Otherwise, you wouldn't be the king.

463
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,060
Now, you use those dirty tricks

464
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,060
to make a deal with your sister-in-law.

465
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,060
You are a close friend of your mother.

466
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,060
Chong Yibiao,

467
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,060
do you know that your existence

468
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,060
is a stain on the North Marquis's mansion?

469
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:38,060
You are an unforgivable sinner.

470
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,060
You and your bitch mother

471
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,060
are all scoundrels.

472
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,060
Chong Yibiao,

473
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,060
I won't allow you to insult my mother.

474
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,060
Chong Yibiao,

475
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,060
how could he come here

476
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,060
and kill the bitch?

477
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,060
You are the bastard of the South Marquis.

478
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,060
What do you want?

479
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,060
You want to rebel?

480
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,060
What do you want?

481
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,060
Are you a bastard?

482
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,060
Chong Xiu,

483
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,060
don't ruin yourself

484
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,060
because of them.

485
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,060
You are not worthy.

486
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:10,060
So I'll do whatever you say.

487
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,340
I hope you don't take it to heart.

488
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,180
You should be patient,

489
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,340
and you'll make a big mistake.

490
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,420
You're not the one to talk.

491
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,740
Uncle Yin told me

492
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,780
that you went to see him.

493
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,780
So I said

494
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,740
what I said to him for someone else.

495
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,060
It's hard to find a friend.

496
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,340
It's a pity to be apart.

497
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,620
Xia Yu,

498
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,300
go to bed early.

499
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,980
Damn he is not awake.

500
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,300
It's spring

501
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,180
Why is it so cold at night?

502
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,420
It's cold at night

503
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,900
You should rest early

504
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,660
I want to hear the rain sound

505
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,340
You can go

506
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:56,780
Yes

507
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,900
My gut feels so cold

508
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,940
But my fades clearly

509
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,900
You are my right hand

510
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,060
L wooden sword

511
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,860
지고 이 doen

512
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,180
L ten years

513
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,660
60 years

514
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:34,140
No oneано

515
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,300
I am far away from you

516
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,500
And I can't ignore your fragrance

517
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,740
In breast

518
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:47,740
I will definitely make you pay for your sins.

519
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,740
For three years, the Crown Prince drank the bitter medicine and was punished.

520
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,740
He only left one life.

521
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:59,740
Now the Crown Prince is weak and weak.

522
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,740
He needs to be punished by the Great Chang.

523
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:09,740
My Crown Prince said that Childe Chong was young and was heavily bullied.

524
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,740
He was very strong.

525
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,740
Now he left the Northern Realm and the Heavenly Realm is open.

526
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:18,740
He only wishes that Childe Chong can let go of his hand and fight against the red earth.

527
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:31,740
Even if it's like this, you still speak like a man.

528
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:16,740
I will definitely make you pay for your sins.

529
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:21,740
For three years, the Crown Prince drank the bitter medicine and was punished.

530
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,740
He only left one life.

531
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:28,740
Now the Crown Prince is weak and weak.

532
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,740
He only wishes that Childe Chong can let go of his hand and fight against the red earth.

533
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:36,740
He only wishes that Childe Chong can let go of his hand and fight against the red earth.

534
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,740
He only wishes that Childe Chong can let go of his hand and fight against the red earth.

535
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:44,740
He only wishes that Childe Chong can let go of his hand and fight against the red earth.

536
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:48,740
He only wishes that Childe Chong can let go of his hand and fight against the red earth.

537
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,740
He only wishes that Childe Chong can let go of his hand and fight against the red earth.

538
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,740
He only wishes that Childe Chong can let go of his hand and fight against the red earth.

539
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:00,740
He only wishes that Childe Chong can let go of his hand and fight against the red earth.

540
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,740
He only wishes that Childe Chong can let go of his hand and fight against the red earth.

541
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,740
He only wishes that Childe Chong can let go of his hand and fight against the red earth.

542
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:42,740
He only wishes that Childe Chong can let go of his hand and fight against the red earth.

543
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,740
He only wishes that Childe Chong can let go of his hand and fight against the red earth.

544
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:50,740
He only wishes that Childe Chong can let go of his hand and fight against the red earth.

545
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:54,740
He only wishes that Childe Chong can let go of his hand and fight against the red earth.

546
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:58,740
He only wishes that Childe Chong can let go of his hand and fight against the red earth.

547
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:02,740
He only wishes that Childe Chong can let go of his hand and fight against the red earth.

548
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:06,740
He only wishes that Childe Chong can let go of his hand and fight against the red earth.

549
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:11,740
I miss him the most.
