1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The love and dreams are endless

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,600
Never give up

3
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,400
Only for the end in our hearts

4
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,000
Until the dawn breaks

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Never stop

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Episode 15

7
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The Love and Dreams

8
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Little girl, why are you here?

9
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Here, little girl, have some soup.

10
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Brother Jiang, who is she?

11
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I forgot to introduce her to everyone.

12
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This is my sister, Jiang Yi Yao.

13
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Wu Yi from Donglu City.

14
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Everyone take the antidote.

15
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
After an hour, you can move freely.

16
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I didn't expect Brother Jiang to have a fairy sister who is good at art and plants.

17
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What a blessing.

18
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Thank you, little girl.

19
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
If you didn't come,

20
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm afraid that the brothers would be in the wilderness.

21
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But, didn't you go to the mountains with your master?

22
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Why are you here?

23
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Brother asked me to come.

24
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What does this mean?

25
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You mean, Brother asked you to be a military doctor?

26
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No, the journey is long, it's hard to predict.

27
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's too dangerous.

28
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's more dangerous, so Brother needs me more.

29
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But...

30
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Brother will protect me.

31
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Besides, I'm here.

32
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's more dangerous to go back alone.

33
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay, then follow us.

34
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Don't worry.

35
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
If these guys bully you,

36
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
tell me anytime.

37
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Brother Jiang, what you said is

38
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yi Yao is kind and kind.

39
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We can't spoil her.

40
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And bully her, right?

41
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes, that's right.

42
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Sister Yi Yao, how old are you?

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Do you have a lover?

44
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What do you think of me?

45
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Stop talking nonsense.

46
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm lucky to have a big brain.

47
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You are black and pale.

48
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I didn't expect that.

49
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Impossible, you're wrong.

50
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Look again.

51
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
By the way, my sister is very smart.

52
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But she couldn't hear or speak

53
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
because of some problems.

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
She can't speak.

55
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
If you want to talk to her,

56
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
you can speak slowly.

57
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
She can speak pure language.

58
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You can communicate with her.

59
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
This time, Sister Yi Yao

60
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
will go with us.

61
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Take care of her.

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Of course.

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yes, we need her to take care of us.

64
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Brother Jiang's sister is our sister.

65
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Be careful.

66
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Hurry.

67
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Brother Chong, you're bitten by a snake.

68
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Brother Chong, are you okay?

69
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You need to be treated.

70
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Get out of the way.

71
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What are you doing?

72
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm helping you to treat your wound.

73
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Brother Chong, my sister is smart.

74
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's okay.

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Get it.

76
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Do you want this?

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Hold on, Chong.

78
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Are you okay?

79
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's late.

80
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Let's go back and rest.

81
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Thank you.

82
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's okay.

83
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Let's go.

84
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You're not sleeping?

85
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm not.

86
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Brother Jiang.

87
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What's wrong?

88
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Something on your mind?

89
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
No.

90
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I just feel

91
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
something is wrong.

92
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yes.

93
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm not sleeping.

94
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm not sleeping.

95
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm not sleeping.

96
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Yes.

97
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Why is there such a big

98
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
gas in the wilderness?

99
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
How do you know it's poisonous?

100
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Is it hard to read?

101
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I did some research before I came to the village.

102
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So I know.

103
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I see.

104
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But this gas

105
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
is special for Zhongli.

106
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But gas often appears in the forest.

107
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It shouldn't appear here.

108
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And this poisonous snake.

109
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's afraid of fire.

110
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
How did it come here?

111
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It seems

112
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
we've been

113
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
watched.

114
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Anyway,

115
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
once we enter Zhongli,

116
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
we'll know it's not.

117
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
No.

118
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Once we're out of here,

119
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
the wind and clouds will rise.

120
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I suddenly feel

121
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
you're full of worry.

122
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You're getting more and more like

123
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
my father.

124
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Okay.

125
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Don't be so sad.

126
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We're in the same boat.

127
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Why are you afraid?

128
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You're not sleepy?

129
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm fine.

130
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Fine?

131
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Then don't sleep.

132
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Stay with me.

133
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Let's go.

134
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'll go up.

135
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Don't go up and down.

136
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Stay safe.

137
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Look.

138
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
This is Zhongli.

139
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Qingqing,

140
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'll lure the bad guy away.

141
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Don't go.

142
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Don't worry.

143
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'll come back for you.

144
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Kunwu, you're a good person.

145
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Remember,

146
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Kun's army

147
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
will never be defeated.

148
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Father, what's wrong?

149
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Father!

150
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Father!

151
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Let's go.

152
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's right ahead.

153
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What's so urgent?

154
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's a big deal.

155
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Uncle,

156
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
what happened ahead?

157
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Why are you so hasty?

158
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You're not locals.

159
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Today is the day of

160
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
the Saintess of Zhongli.

161
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Hurry up.

162
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Saintess?

163
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You're here early.

164
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Hurry up.

165
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Where is this?

166
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Hurry up.

167
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Where is it?

168
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Wait, didn't they say there's a Saintess?

169
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Where is she?

170
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Look.

171
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Is there really a Saintess?

172
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Saintess!

173
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Saintess!

174
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Go.

175
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Go.

176
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's stopped raining.

177
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Put out all the flowers of the King.

178
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's been half an hour.

179
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
When will the King of Zhongli see us?

180
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's about time.

181
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Hasn't the King of your country

182
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
come to the court yet?

183
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
When will the King of your country come?

184
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
How dare we know?

185
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Please forgive us.

186
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Please be patient.

187
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
King of Zhongli is so arrogant.

188
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
He clearly doesn't

189
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
take our camp seriously.

190
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Although our camp is

191
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
out of the way,

192
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
it represents the King.

193
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
King of Zhongli is so arrogant.

194
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't know

195
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
if he's trying to do this or not.

196
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But Zhongli is a small country.

197
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
He doesn't dare to

198
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
act like a guard.

199
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But I heard that King of Zhongli is so useless.

200
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
He's all under the control of the State Preceptor.

201
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It doesn't seem like he's just a joke.

202
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm sorry.

203
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm sorry, King of Zhongli.

204
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm sorry, King of Zhongli.

205
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
What are you talking about?

206
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You're so annoying.

207
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
How could you be so generous?

208
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Such a wonderful flower.

209
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You're so generous.

210
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
This little flower is just a gift for you.

211
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's not that bad.

212
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
If you hurt him, you'll die.

213
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Come on.

214
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Let him go.

215
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Kill them all.

216
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Stop.

217
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
This is the messenger of Shangshan.

218
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You're the son of the duke.

219
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You don't want to hurt Sheng Wei.

220
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Please forgive me.

221
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
State Preceptor.

222
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
They destroyed my night-burning altar.

223
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You have to help me.

224
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Please go back to the hall and change your clothes.

225
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
This is the master of Zhongli State.

226
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Please.

227
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Treasurer's Office

228
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
We don't know that you came.

229
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
We're sorry for our rudeness.

230
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Please forgive us.

231
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,400
In this way becomes the

232
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,580
unfolding moment,

233
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,960
practically without any

234
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,920
explanation anymore.

235
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,080
Officials in this position

236
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,640
don't expect

237
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,560
the winners

238
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,000
to stand in their technically

239
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,460
better manner.

240
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,200
At least,

241
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,560
Xi Neng,

242
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,500
straight away,

243
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,400
lives the life

244
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,080
of the peek.

245
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,080
I'm here to find the immortality elixir for His Majesty.

246
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,560
We've just arrived.

247
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,560
I hope that all of you in Zhongli

248
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,560
can help us.

249
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,560
Don't worry, Your Highness.

250
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,160
All of us will do our best to cooperate.

251
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,560
But this matter is very important.

252
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,560
Besides, there's no clue.

253
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,560
Since you've come from afar,

254
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,060
why don't you stay in the courier house?

255
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,060
When we find the clue,

256
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,060
we'll inform you immediately.

257
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,060
I'll leave it to you, State Preceptor.

258
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,060
I'm tired.

259
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,060
For this matter,

260
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,060
you can handle it yourself.

261
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,060
This is Prince of Nandu,

262
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,060
Mr. E-Shun, right?

263
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,060
Has Mr. E-Shun been to Zhongli?

264
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,060
No.

265
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,060
Although Zhongli is located in the remote area,

266
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,060
it's not a place where you can't visit.

267
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,060
It's a place where you can't visit.

268
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,060
It's a place where you can't visit.

269
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,040
Although Zhongli is located in the remote area,

270
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,040
it's not a place where you can't visit.

271
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,040
But the scenery is beautiful and the people are simple.

272
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,040
Mr. E-Shun, you can visit it.

273
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,040
I'll leave it to you.

274
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,040
I'm really unlucky.

275
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,040
I'm really unlucky.

276
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,020
You're talking nonsense.

277
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,020
Did I say something wrong?

278
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,020
We're all dukes and princes.

279
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,020
We've never seen anything like this.

280
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,020
Have you ever seen anything like this?

281
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,020
I'm telling you,

282
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,020
Zhongli will be destroyed sooner or later.

283
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,020
Brother Xin, you haven't left the palace.

284
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,020
Say a few words.

285
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,020
I won't say it.

286
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,020
I've been to Zhongli,

287
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,020
but I haven't seen a beauty.

288
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,020
I almost died once.

289
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,020
Don't you think so?

290
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,020
She said she was going to see a beauty.

291
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,020
Isn't this the saint girl today?

292
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,020
Hurry up.

293
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,020
Make way for the door.

294
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,020
Go, go, go.

295
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,020
Hurry up, go, go.

296
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,020
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

297
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,020
Please wait, young masters.

298
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,020
You're a famous man.

299
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,020
You're a hero.

300
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,020
Why are you making fun of me?

301
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,020
Miss.

302
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,020
You lost something.

303
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,020
I didn't take it.

304
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,020
If you don't believe me,

305
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,020
you can search.

306
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,020
This handkerchief was made by me.

307
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,020
So it's very real.

308
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,020
I hope you can return it.

309
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,020
Thank you for your plan.

310
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,020
Hurry up and thank me.

311
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,020
I let you take a chance

312
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,020
to get close to the beauty.

313
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,020
Go.

314
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,020
Hurry up.

315
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,020
Go.

316
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,020
I'm tired.

317
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,020
You let them all go.

318
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,020
Yes.

319
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,020
Qingqing.

320
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,020
Brother gave you.

321
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,020
Do you like it?

322
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,020
Is it really him?

323
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,020
It seems that the news from the south capital is true.

324
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,020
Brother Jiang.

325
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,020
The station is here.

326
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,020
What are you doing?

327
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,020
What's going on?

328
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,020
I am under the order of the state.

329
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,020
I am here to protect the princes.

330
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,020
We are all men who practice martial arts.

331
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,020
Why do we need your protection?

332
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,020
The state teacher said

333
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,020
the princes are the body of the Golden Jade.

334
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,020
They must not make any mistakes in the middle of the forest.

335
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,020
Otherwise, they can't be told about the injury.

336
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,020
The soldiers are watching.

337
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,020
I don't know if the state teacher is trying to protect

338
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,020
or monitor.

339
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,020
Retreat.

340
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,020
Retreat.

341
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,020
Brother.

342
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,020
Brother Jiang.

343
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,020
Did you see the soldiers at the gate?

344
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,020
Yes.

345
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,020
They all stood like gods.

346
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,020
But you don't have to worry.

347
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,020
They have been driven away by us.

348
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,020
But they didn't go far.

349
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,020
They are just arranging around.

350
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,020
They are just changing their names.

351
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,020
We are the messengers.

352
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,020
How can we be so far from them?

353
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,020
The state teacher was so kind and

354
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,020
said he would help us.

355
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,020
He is so ungrateful.

356
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,020
The state teacher said

357
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,020
there was no clue about the medicine.

358
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,020
He will tell us when he has the news.

359
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,020
Anyway, the whole Zhongli is so strange.

360
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,020
We should

361
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,020
keep a few more eyes on this trip.

362
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,020
Brother Xinjia.

363
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,020
What's wrong with your neck?

364
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,020
Since you asked me,

365
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,020
I have to tell you

366
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,020
I have been walking around the Ghost Gate today.

367
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,020
Right, Brother Chong?

368
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,020
Tell him.

369
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,020
Forget it.

370
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,020
Brother Eishun saw that

371
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,020
I was standing outside the hall.

372
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,020
It was like a jade tree was flying.

373
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,020
Right?

374
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,020
Look.

375
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,020
The first warrior of the Liyi grassland

376
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,020
was beaten by En.

377
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,020
I will tell you later.

378
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,020
Brother Jiang.

379
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,020
Can you tell us

380
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,020
if they don't tell us?

381
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,020
Look.

382
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,020
Look.

383
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,020
You tell us.

384
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,020
You are so rude.

385
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,020
I will beat you today.

386
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,020
Eishun.

387
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,020
Tell us.

388
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,020
You are so loyal to that Saintess Zhongli.

389
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,020
I didn't expect that

390
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,020
the crown prince of the southern capital

391
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,020
would be in the crowd.

392
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,020
But he was just

393
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,020
saying a few words to her.

394
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,020
He was so scared.

395
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,020
If you like her,

396
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,020
just tell me.

397
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,020
I will help you.

398
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,020
I will help you.

399
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,020
Saintess Dol персон

by the killing of the Perfect и

408
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,980
The cantilever Tao

409
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,020
By the Perfect Tao

410
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,020
My talent is being Science esteemed.

411
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,440
I Gan Ma

412
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,480
with the wife and child

413
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,780
of Change Iím pretty

414
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,780
Sister.

415
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,780
Sister.

416
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,420
Coming.

417
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,900
Be careful, Shou Ni.

418
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,420
Ling Er.

419
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,660
Ling Er.

420
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,340
Ling Er.

421
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,780
Water is the rock, fire is the pear.

422
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,900
Water, fire, and fire.

423
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,540
Zhen Ren.

424
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,780
Go and save Ling Er.

425
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,340
You've been waiting for years.

426
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,060
Finally, you're back.

427
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,380
If you fall, it's because of her.

428
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,300
Save her.

429
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,020
It's useless.

430
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,740
She was killed in the battlefield.

431
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,540
No one can save her.

432
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,460
I've set up the six-leaf-hook tonight.

433
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,700
I knew you would come.

434
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,700
I also knew she would die.

435
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,420
If she dies here,

436
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,460
it's her destiny.

437
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,900
You can't save her.

438
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,420
I can't either.

439
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:42,900
Zhen Ren.

440
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,980
Do you really want to die?

441
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,660
It's hard to be a god.

442
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,180
Saintess should know better than me.

443
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,100
If that's the case,

444
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,260
what about me?

445
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,340
I should have been dead.

446
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,180
But I'm still alive.

447
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,740
Can you tell me

448
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,060
what's the point of my death?

449
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:07,860
It's almost time.

450
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,460
Go back.

451
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:33,440
Did you sound out the earth Imma 10 LYD

452
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,500
The government affair

453
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,940
The war tá is taken care of.

454
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,100
Su Ying's blood is only left by Su Qingqing.

455
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,020
If she dies, there will be no one to follow her.

456
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,500
For the sake of this Saintess,

457
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,460
I've already made the person who should die live for too long.

458
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,020
Pass on my order.

459
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,460
Prepare for the Holy Wedding.

460
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,900
But the Holy Wedding is not a small thing.

461
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,060
It must have a perfect reason to make the people happy.

462
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,900
A perfect reason? What's so hard about that?

463
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,180
The King's body is in need of a family recently.

464
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,740
Isn't that right?

465
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,260
Su Qingqing knows too much.

466
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,740
If that person comes back now,

467
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:31,260
Su Qingqing's death will surely lead her out.

468
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,220
So that we can get rid of her.

469
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,180
Gu Xi,

470
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:43,980
you've always been good at war secrets.

471
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,380
You're my stronghold.

472
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:51,020
That's why I've put my attention and attention to you.

473
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,940
If I succeed in the future,

474
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,460
the position of State Preceptor of Zhongli

475
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,980
will be yours.

476
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,740
I won't let you down.

477
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,980
I've checked all the bricks in Zhongli City.

478
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,060
I can't find anything.

479
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,780
Do you think the Immortal Immortal is reliable?

480
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:27,820
How could we possibly find the people behind us?

481
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,660
That's right. Why don't we change the person?

482
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,980
I'm tired of seeing these people.

483
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,860
Why don't we change the taste?

484
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,660
What taste?

485
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,260
What taste?

486
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,460
Stop!

487
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,980
Stop!

488
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,260
If I don't chase them, they'll only chase me.

489
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,060
Do you think I'm easy to bully?

490
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:06,860
Come down.

491
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,860
White team, take your hands.

492
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,860
Attack!

493
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,060
Big! Big!

494
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,460
Excuse me! Excuse me!

495
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,260
Don't hit me!

496
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,260
Where are you going?

497
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,740
Where are you going?

498
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,740
That way.

499
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,740
Go!

500
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,740
Go! Go!

501
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,740
You want to fight with me?

502
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,740
You're so stubborn.

503
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,740
Why is it you?

504
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,740
Young Master, I'm not good at this.

505
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,740
I really can't repair this chain.

506
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,740
You have to repair it.

507
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,740
Do you want to repair it or not?

508
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,740
No.

509
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,740
No.

510
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,740
Don't follow me around anymore.

511
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,020
Otherwise, the leader will not be the one who will be broken

512
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:52,020
Hit it! Hit it! Hit it! Hit it!

513
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,020
Sorry, brothers

514
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,020
I'm sorry

515
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,020
Isn't this a good thing?

516
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,020
Yes

517
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,020
Brother, are you interested in gambling?

518
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,020
What gambling? Tell me

519
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,020
There is a big game in the west

520
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:07,020
Let's bet on whether the wedding in Zhongli City will go smoothly

521
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,020
What?

522
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,020
Wedding?

523
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,300
Yes

524
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,300
Get out of the way

525
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,300
We have no chance to win these days

526
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,300
This state preceptor is really in the game

527
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,300
I heard that this state preceptor is from Shangshan

528
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,300
But now he wants to persuade us to find him

529
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,300
I really don't know what he is thinking

530
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,300
Everyone, go and have a look

531
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,300
It seems that I am going to hold a wedding ceremony

532
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,300
What is it?

533
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,300
Look

534
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,580
Look

535
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,580
It says that Zhongli City is in a good shape every year

536
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,580
Our country's chief is seriously ill

537
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,580
The state preceptor ordered that the saint girl will hold the wedding ceremony three days later

538
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,580
and the blessing will be granted to Zhongli City

539
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,580
How many years has the wedding ceremony not been held?

540
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,580
Yes

541
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,580
That will take decades

542
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,580
But since the Kunsu family

543
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,580
What is this?

544
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,860
Brother

545
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,860
What does the wedding mean?

546
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,860
No one knows the meaning of the wedding

547
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,860
The wedding

548
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:08,860
No

549
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,860
Where are you going?

550
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,860
What wedding?

551
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,860
It's actually a person's death ceremony

552
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,860
What?

553
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:16,860
Say it again

554
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,860
It's a person's death ceremony

555
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,140
The wedding ceremony

556
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,140
How is it?

557
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,140
How is it?

558
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,140
Did you find any clues?

559
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,140
No clues

560
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,140
It's already a small matter to be able to get rid of those scouts

561
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,140
I am very clever

562
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,140
Jiu Lv, do you have any clues?

563
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,420
I heard that

564
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:52,420
the saint girl of Zhongli City will hold the wedding ceremony three days later

565
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,420
You heard it too?

566
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,420
You heard it too?

567
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,420
Nonsense

568
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,420
Everyone on the street is talking about it

569
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:03,420
It seems that the wedding ceremony is a big thing for the people of Zhongli

570
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,420
Brother Cheng, Brother Xingjia

571
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,420
What is the wedding ceremony?

572
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:07,560
The wedding is due to the

573
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,420
The wedding is due to the

574
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,420
the marriage of the saint girl of Zhongli

575
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,420
It is an important ceremony in the state of Zhongli

576
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,420
The important thing is eight words

577
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,700
White water is a sharp heart, the sun and the moon can be seen clearly

578
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,700
Do you know what it means?

579
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,700
The white water refers to the water and silver

580
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,700
Brother He Cheng

581
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,700
The so-called wedding ceremony

582
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,700
is actually to use the water and silver to make the saint girl suffer

583
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,700
and then preserve a body that is not attached to the body to the sky

584
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,700
This is too inhumane

585
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,700
The saint girl family actually treats her family so badly

586
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,700
But I heard that this ceremony was done by the saint girl family

587
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,980
Now the people are guessing whether it can be done smoothly

588
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,980
Brother Jiang, do you have any clues?

589
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,980
Is it possible that I said it?

590
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,980
What's wrong with you?

591
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,980
