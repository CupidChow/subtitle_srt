1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,520
swallow Beck coisas

2
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,720
celebrate the love and permit

3
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,040
till their ears are blocked

4
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,140
in the

5
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,520
heaven hell

6
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,440
the song big

7
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,420
song

8
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,520
neverAlways

9
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,000
One day

10
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,480
in the

11
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,120
I don't get tired

12
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,620
a man who is about to die

13
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,920
I am shredded

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Saintess, it's time to take your medicine

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I don't want to take it

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's fine

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's all about how to serve Saintess

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Take her out and put her on the ground

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Please spare us

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Please spare us

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Please spare us

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Please spare us

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Please spare us

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'll take it

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Please

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Please

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
All right

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You can take care of Saintess

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
There's poison in the medicine

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
No

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's the doctor who made it

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It has nothing to do with me

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Somebody

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm going to see the doctor

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Somebody

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Saintess wants to see the doctor

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Go and tell her

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Saintess, be careful

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Wait

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Wait

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I don't think it hurts that much

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm tired

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I want to go back and rest

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You can stay outside

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
No

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
How can no one take care of Saintess?

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's the wedding three days later

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
If something bad happens to me

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Aunt can afford it

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Then we'll stay outside

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Saintess, rest in peace

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No one

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You come out

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Brother

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Brother

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Come here, Sister

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Sister

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Sister

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Qingqing

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's me

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm back

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Brother Guangwu

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm sorry

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
All these years

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Thank you

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Brother, you've lost weight

70
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Your beauty has grown

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You're taller

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's been seven years

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Of course

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But last time in the palace

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I recognized you at a glance

76
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I know

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's brother who came back

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
By the way

79
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This is the only thing left when my father left

80
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Keep it

81
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What did they give you?

82
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Nothing

83
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's just a magic trick

84
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm not a Qingqing who can't do anything

85
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
All these years

86
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You've been quiet

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I thought you were gone

88
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Until the Nandu people found me

89
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
They said they'd let me wait for you

90
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's been seven years

91
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I can see you're alive

92
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I have no regrets

93
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Don't worry

94
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I know about the marriage

95
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I won't let you die

96
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Brother Guangwu

97
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Brother Guangwu

98
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's not easy for you to go out alone

99
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
If you bring me along

100
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm afraid you and I can't leave

101
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Our Kun family

102
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Can't be left alone

103
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm Wanfu

104
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm Wanfu

105
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm here late at night

106
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What's the matter?

107
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I heard that you were sick tonight

108
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's just a small problem

109
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Thank you for your concern

110
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Before the wedding

111
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I hope you can take care of yourself

112
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm fine

113
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm fine

114
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm fine

115
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm fine

116
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You must take care of yourself

117
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You're kidding

118
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You send people to protect me every day

119
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll be fine

120
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Do you have guests here?

121
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
How can I have guests?

122
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm the only one

123
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Really?

124
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Guests

125
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Stop

126
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Hurry

127
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Stop

128
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Don't run

129
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Stop

130
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Go

131
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Go

132
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Hurry

133
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Go

134
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Go

135
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Go

136
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Where are they?

137
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Master, they ran away

138
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You're a bunch of assholes

139
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Where's the medicine box?

140
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'll go get it

141
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Do you have anything to ask me?

142
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I guess you've guessed it

143
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm not the son of the Duke of Nanbo, He Shun

144
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But the slave you saved on the East Road

145
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:58,000
you must have grown up

146
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
At that time

147
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I was taken away by the people of Duke Nanbo's mansion.

148
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,760
I then decided on his identity.

149
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,000
I...

150
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I went to the East Road to search for him.

151
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,240
I never thought that I would meet you again.

152
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,240
All this time, I wanted to confess to you.

153
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,480
But I couldn't.

154
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,760
Because I had to fulfill my mission.

155
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,760
Only by doing this, could I have the chance to return to my homeland.

156
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,000
You are the only family I have in this world.

157
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You are the Saintess of Zhongli, Su Jingjing.

158
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,000
Brother Jiang.

159
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I lied to you.

161
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Why?

162
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Since I didn't ask you why you wanted to tell me why,

163
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
you have been so stubborn all this time.

164
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Why are you still trying to get rid of me?

165
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Why don't you keep lying to me?

166
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Do you know what your words mean?

167
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I know.

168
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Brother Jiang, you have always been my best friend.

169
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
But I'm more like a brother.

170
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But now, I can't

171
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
or don't want to

172
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
lie to you anymore.

173
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Brother Jiang.

174
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Brother.

175
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Brother Jiang.

178
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Brother.

179
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You know me.

180
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You are stupid.

181
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
How dare you!

182
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
How dare you try to be my brother!

183
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Brother Jiang.

184
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Don't forget.

185
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You are no longer the Prince of Nambu House.

186
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You are no longer the lowly servant I got from the street.

187
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
If you want to be my brother,

188
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
you are not qualified.

189
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm Kunwu.

190
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I know I'm ashamed of you.

191
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
If you could save me,

192
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I would kill you

193
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
and let you die.

194
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
How dare you!

195
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You are the one who framed the Crown Prince

196
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and implicated me.

197
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Now you want to set me up.

198
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I will pay for it.

199
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Stop thinking about it!

200
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I won't reveal my identity.

201
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
If there is an accident,

202
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I will never implicated you.

203
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Until now,

204
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I don't believe you.

205
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Why should I believe you?

206
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You have implicated me for so long.

207
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What did you do

208
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
to wrong Shen Ziying?

209
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I didn't do anything

210
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
that has nothing to do with you.

211
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's not me.

212
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
If you don't believe me,

213
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
kill me.

214
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You saved my life anyway.

215
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Kill me!

216
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Kunwu.

217
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Kunwu.

218
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
This is your name.

219
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
We fought side by side.

220
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I thought you had hidden it.

221
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
But I wouldn't ask you.

222
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I hope

223
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I can treat you with all my heart.

224
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
One day,

225
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
you will be my wife.

226
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I treat you

227
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:14,120
as a life-saving

228
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,120
But I don't know your real name.

229
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,120
It's ridiculous.

230
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,120
I told you.

231
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,120
As long as you believe me,

232
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,120
I will fight with you

233
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,120
no matter what.

234
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,120
But why did you...

235
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,120
Because I don't want to.

236
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,120
We are

237
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,120
far apart.

238
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,120
There shouldn't be any conflict.

239
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,120
I am a man

240
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,120
who risked my life for blood.

241
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,120
No matter what,

242
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,120
I should fight with you

243
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,120
for blood.

244
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,120
I should fight with you

245
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,120
as a prince of Eastland.

246
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,120
It's okay.

247
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
I don't care about blood,

248
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,120
hatred, and hatred.

249
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,120
I don't care about your life.

250
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,120
I can decide

251
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,120
who you live for.

252
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,120
Jiang Luolian.

253
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,120
I buried your life.

254
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,120
I can decide

255
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,120
how you live for.

256
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,120
Now,

257
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,120
I want you to live for yourself.

258
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,120
Do you understand?

259
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,120
Wow, that's interesting.

260
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,120
I didn't expect that guy

261
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,120
had other identities.

262
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,120
Brother Chu, wait for me.

263
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,120
Brother Jiang and Brother He Shen,

264
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,120
what happened?

265
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,120
Brother He,

266
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,120
we were in the wrong place.

267
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,120
Brother He,

268
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,120
I didn't mean to hurt you.

269
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,880
Nothing major.

270
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,720
Rest for a few days and we'll be fine.

271
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,060
speech

272
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
If not make things clear

273
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,760
Today, don't try to leave the door

274
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,560
Just conduct ourselves.

275
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,000
It will only drag everyone in this image.

276
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,000
You could not stop me..

277
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,620
the One and only...

278
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,360
You are the Wiegzfin

279
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,180
and the Greatrique.

280
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,780
You can't stop me.

281
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,700
Then you can try.

282
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,420
Everyone has seen Brother Cheng's good moves.

283
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,900
There's no need to be dramatic.

284
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,060
No.

285
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,620
Brother.

286
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,980
We are brothers.

287
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,500
Can't I even hear you say a few words of truth?

288
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,980
Brothers?

289
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,380
You are too naive.

290
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,180
Stop being so angry, okay?

291
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,660
Just listen to him first.

292
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,740
Brother.

293
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,340
I'm not that stupid.

294
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,540
I know you don't want to tell the truth

295
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,660
because you're afraid of getting us involved.

296
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,220
But now we are all in the same boat.

297
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,900
If you don't tell the truth,

298
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,700
it will only make us a mess.

299
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,700
It's hard to prevent.

300
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,460
Tell me.

301
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,980
One

302
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,140
My name is Kun Wu,

303
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,340
a citizen of Zhongli State.

304
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,580
I'm姆m all the 받아 when it comes to Zhongli

305
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,980
and have only me, Young General.

306
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,980
Our Kun family has been in the military for generations.

307
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,980
We are the leaders of the Kun family army.

308
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,980
This picture is the memorial of our Kun family army.

309
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,980
My mother Su Ying

310
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,980
is the daughter of the Song and Li dynasty.

311
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,980
Her father is a respected official.

312
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,980
If there is no change,

313
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,980
I should have inherited my father's position as the fifth general

314
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,980
and guard the Wang family in the capital.

315
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,980
My sister Su Qingqing's bloodline

316
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,980
will be the new born of the Yousu clan.

317
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,980
However,

318
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,980
a few years ago,

319
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,980
the Wang family went to Shangshan to meet them.

320
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,980
They were released a few months later.

321
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,980
When they came back,

322
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,980
the Wang family's carriage

323
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,980
was sent back by the Shangshan iron ring.

324
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,980
On the first day of the new year,

325
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,980
my father was ordered to enter the palace to welcome the state.

326
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,980
I didn't expect that

327
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,980
everything

328
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,980
changed because of this.

329
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,980
I

330
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,980
welcome the state master.

331
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,980
The state master is here to see the king.

332
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,980
Today is the day of his return.

333
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,980
The journey must be tiring.

334
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,980
I wonder what the state master

335
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,980
called me to come here.

336
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,980
Who are you?

337
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,980
Where is the state master?

338
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,980
General Kun,

339
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,980
please don't leave.

340
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,980
I am Shangshan's envoy,

341
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,980
Xian Xuanji.

342
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,980
According to the king's order,

343
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,980
there is a secret notice

344
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,980
to announce first.

345
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,980
Cheng,

346
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,980
Shang Wang Yi,

347
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,980
the state master of Zhongli,

348
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,980
committed a crime

349
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,980
and attempted to assassinate

350
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,980
by the opportunity of the close sword.

351
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,980
He was killed on the spot.

352
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,980
However,

353
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,980
the king is the most important person in the world.

354
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,980
He is the most important person in the world.

355
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,980
He decided to forget the past.

356
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,980
He changed the state of Zhongli to the state of Zhu Hou.

357
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,980
From today on,

358
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,980
Xian Xuanji will be the state master

359
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,980
and assist the right master in Zhongli.

360
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,980
In the spring and autumn of Zhongli,

361
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,980
he will pay tribute to Shangshan

362
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,980
to show his loyalty.

363
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,980
Not only that,

364
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,980
General Kun

365
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,980
will also hand over his military power

366
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,980
and take the opportunity

367
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,980
to die to serve Shangshan.

368
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,980
You are quite stubborn.

369
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,980
Mother,

370
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,980
you are

371
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,980
ordering the Su Village to be destroyed.

372
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,980
What happened?

373
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,980
Nothing.

374
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,980
Just in case.

375
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,980
Your father hasn't returned for a long time.

376
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,980
I will go to the palace to find him.

377
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,980
You two stay at home.

378
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,980
Mother, mother.

379
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,980
When will you come back?

380
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,980
Qingqing,

381
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,980
do you remember

382
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,980
the fate of the Saintess of the Yousu Clan?

383
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,980
I remember.

384
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,980
The Saintess of the Yousu Clan

385
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,980
is in a different shape and shape.

386
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,980
The Saintess is in a different shape and shape.

387
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,980
She is supposed to change her body and power

388
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,980
to protect Zhongli.

389
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,980
If you can't protect her,

390
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,980
what should you do?

391
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,980
What should you do?

392
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,980
Tell me.

393
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,980
Mother,

394
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,980
don't scare Qingqing.

395
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,980
Don't expect your brother to plead for you.

396
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,980
Your brother has his mission.

397
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,980
The Saintess of the Su family

398
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,980
has our own destiny.

399
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,980
We can't forget her

400
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,980
even if we die.

401
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,980
Tell me.

402
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,980
If you can't protect her,

403
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:17,980
what should you do?

404
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,980
Change her body into a fire

405
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,980
to protect her?

406
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,980
Mother,

407
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,980
what does she mean?

408
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,980
Why did you make such an urgent oath?

409
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,980
She has the blood of the Saintess of the Yousu Clan.

410
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,980
This is our destiny.

411
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,980
I don't want such an oath

412
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,980
to happen one day.

413
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,980
Let's go.

414
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,980
Let's go back to our room for dinner.

415
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,980
Kunwu,

416
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,980
you must take good care of Qingqing.

417
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,980
Yes, mother.

418
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,980
I might have been too worried today.

419
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,980
I'll go get your father back.

420
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,980
Alright.

421
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,980
Let's go for dinner.

422
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,980
Let's go.

423
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:09,980
Let's go for dinner.

424
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,980
Hurry up.

425
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,980
Can he go faster?

426
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,980
I didn't expect

427
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,980
that on the way

428
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,980
to Zhongli Palace

429
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,980
after my mother left Kunwu,

430
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,980
I met my father.

431
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,980
I killed all my mother

432
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,980
and the Sun family.

433
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,980
And my mother

434
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,980
was also kidnapped by them.

435
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,980
Back off.

436
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,980
Young Master.

437
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,980
Qian Xuanji,

438
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,980
where is the Young Master of Zhongli?

439
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,980
What happened next?

440
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,980
What did General Kun see in the palace?

441
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,980
I heard

442
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,980
what happened that day

443
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,980
from the video

444
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,980
that escaped from the palace.

445
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,980
But they were outside the palace.

446
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,980
No one knew

447
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,980
what my father saw

448
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,980
and did in the palace.

449
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,980
They said

450
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,980
that they could only see

451
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,980
when they pushed the palace away.

452
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,980
What did they see? Tell me.

453
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,980
They saw

454
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,980
my mother's body

455
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,980
lying in my father's arms.

456
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,980
My mother's head

457
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,980
was cut off by my father.

458
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,980
Well,

459
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,980
maybe

460
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,980
there is some misunderstanding.

461
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,980
Maybe someone framed her.

462
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,980
My father and mother

463
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,980
were so sharp and sharp.

464
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,980
They were so wise.

465
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,980
It must have been strange.

466
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,980
Did you see General Kun later?

467
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,980
Did you ask him?

468
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:43,980
That day,

469
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,980
I stayed with my sister

470
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,980
at home.

471
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,980
I was eager to bring my mother and father

472
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,980
back to guard the palace.

473
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,980
But the change that happened that night

474
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,980
made Kun's mansion

475
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,980
a sacred place.

476
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,980
Run!

477
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,980
No!

478
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,980
A Yan!

479
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,980
A Yan!

480
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,980
A Yan!

481
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,980
A Yan!

482
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,980
A Yan!

483
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,980
A Yan!

484
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:22,980
A Yan!

485
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,980
A Yan!

486
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,980
A Yan!

487
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,980
A Yan!

488
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,980
A Yan!

489
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,980
A Yan!

490
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,980
What happened?

491
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,980
Qianqian, let's go.

492
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,980
A Yan!

493
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,980
A Yan!

494
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,980
What happened outside?

495
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,980
What happened to Uncle Lin and others?

496
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,980
What?

497
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,980
General Lin also became like this?

498
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,980
Is General Kun not...

499
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,980
A Yan, where is mother?

500
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,980
Where is mother?

501
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,980
Qianqian,

502
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,980
it was A Yan

503
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,980
who took your mother away.

504
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,980
A Yan, what happened?

505
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,980
A Yan!

506
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,980
A Yan!

507
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,980
A Yan!

508
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,980
A Yan!

509
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,980
A Yan!

510
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,980
A Yan, what happened to you?

511
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,980
A Yan!

512
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,980
This is Jingqiu, A Yan!

513
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,980
This is Jingqiu, A Yan!

514
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,980
A Yan!

515
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,980
A Yan!

516
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,980
A Yan!

517
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,980
A Yan!

518
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,980
A Yan!

519
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,980
I'm sorry.

520
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,980
I can't do it.

521
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,980
A Yan!

522
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,980
A Yan!

523
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,980
A Yan!

524
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,980
A Yan!

525
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,980
Let's go.

526
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,980
Let's go.

527
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,980
A Yan!

528
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,980
No matter what happens,

529
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,980
don't come out.

530
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,980
Do you hear me?

531
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,980
A Yan.

532
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,980
A Yan,

533
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,980
you are the descendant of the Kun family.

534
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,980
You must remember,

535
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,980
the Kun family will never be defeated.

536
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,980
Live on.

537
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,980
Live on.

538
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,980
Go in.

539
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,980
A Yan!

540
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,980
A Yan!

541
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,980
A Yan!

542
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,980
A Yan!

543
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,980
A Yan!

544
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:40,980
A Yan!

545
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,980
A Yan!

546
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,980
The leader of the Zhongli,

547
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,980
the rebel of the Kun family,

548
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,980
the genius of the Tianqian,

549
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,980
the demon of the Quan clan,

550
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,980
the holy woman of the Four Killings,

551
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,980
and the wife of Hulu.

552
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,980
Pass on the imperial decree,

553
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,980
the Kun family is not guilty.

554
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,980
All the family members are killed.

555
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,980
A Yan!

556
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:10,980
The Kun family will never be defeated.

557
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,980
Soldiers, listen to my order.

558
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,980
Follow me to the mansion

559
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,980
to investigate the remains of the Kun family.

560
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,980
Hurry up, search.

561
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,980
Yes.

562
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,980
Search carefully.

563
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,980
Yes.

564
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,980
Search carefully.

565
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,980
Brother,

566
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,980
I'm scared.

567
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,980
Don't be scared.

568
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,980
Search carefully.

569
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,980
I'm here.

570
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,980
The imperial decree

571
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,980
doesn't allow anyone to leave the goods.

572
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,980
Search carefully with the eye patch.

573
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:48,980
Yes.

574
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,980
Kunwu, you must take good care of your sister.

575
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,980
Wu'er, live on.

576
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:53,980
Protect Qingqing.

577
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:57,980
Hurry up, search carefully.

578
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,980
Qingqing, I'll lure the bad guys away.

579
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,980
Wait for me here.

580
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,980
Brother, don't go.

581
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,980
Don't worry.

582
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,980
I'll come back to find you.

583
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,980
You must protect yourself.

584
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,980
Remember,

585
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,980
no matter what happens outside,

586
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,980
you must protect yourself.

587
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:12,980
Don't make any noise.

588
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,980
Wait for me here.

589
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,980
Brother.

590
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,980
Give these bad guys back to Wu'er.

591
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,980
Stop.

592
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,980
Stop.

593
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,980
Chase.

594
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:38,980
Chase.

595
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,980
Stop.

596
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,980
Stop.

597
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,980
Don't run.

598
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,980
Hurry up.

599
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,980
Stop.

600
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,980
Chase.

601
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,980
Hurry up.

602
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:02,980
Come here.

603
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,980
Hurry up.

604
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:01,980
Go.

605
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,980
Go.

606
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,980
Go.

607
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,980
