1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We are willing to be good friends, but we love each other and dream of each other for the rest of our lives.

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,520
We are not confident in the world,

3
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,320
only for the end in our hearts.

4
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,760
Until our fates are broken, we will never stop.

5
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,560
Episode 16

6
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,640
Oh no!

7
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,320
This is the ghostly signal!

8
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,320
They are going to attack the city!

9
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,040
Brother Chong asked if we should wait.

10
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,520
I thought it's okay to wait.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,720
It seems that we can wait until the day we break through the city.

12
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,640
General!

13
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,200
What's going on?

14
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,040
We are tricked!

15
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,240
This brat dared to lie to us!

16
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,960
What should we do now?

17
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,360
Retreat!

18
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,960
Oh no! The army of Donglu is coming!

19
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,320
Retreat over there!

20
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,320
Retreat!

21
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,360
Oh no! General!

22
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,640
The army of Donglu is coming this way!

23
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,880
General, we are surrounded!

24
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,000
General Jiang, you are here in time.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,480
General Bogu, the army of Donglu is already around here.

26
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,400
Why don't you lead the army to attack?

27
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,280
You are not lying.

28
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,280
I was careless when I was attacked by a few brats.

29
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,360
But I'm afraid it's too early to admit defeat.

30
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,000
The Ghost Army has been waiting outside the city.

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,560
As long as they get my signal,

32
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,720
no matter how strict your army is,

33
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,960
it will be a battle of death.

34
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,520
We don't know who will win or lose yet.

35
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,040
Guards, bring him here.

36
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,160
General, we are not strong enough.

37
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,600
The army of Donglu has been attacked.

38
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,440
Five thousand soldiers are dead.

39
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,680
This is a big loss!

40
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,040
No way!

41
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,320
General Bogu,

42
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,480
it's the general's way to use your army to make a change.

43
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,080
General of the Ghost Army, listen to my order!

44
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,520
Kill them!

45
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,800
Kill them!

46
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,560
It seems that the army of the Ghost Army has retreated.

47
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,640
Donglu City has been out of our way.

48
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,720
Why do you say so?

49
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,160
These are the signs of our retreat.

50
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,640
It should be Master and Brother to help us out.

51
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,720
What?

52
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
You didn't wait for me for nothing, did you, Brother Chong?

53
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,720
So what?

54
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,840
You mean that you will take Yao Shuliang back to the camp no matter what?

55
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,640
That's right.

56
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,480
That's not easy to do.

57
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,200
I'll get rid of Yao Shuliang.

58
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,320
Then you should try.

59
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,760
Don't fight.

60
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,240
Just talk to him.

61
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,160
Brother Jiang, let him go.

62
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,520
I will.

63
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,920
Don't worry.

64
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,040
Then you decide if you want to let him go or not.

65
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,760
I don't care.

66
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,200
What's so hard about that?

67
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,040
Since we can't get a result,

68
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,840
why don't we let God take the blame?

69
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,720
If you get the white one, let him go.

70
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,760
If you get the black one, take him back.

71
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,960
Life and death are both in the hands of the rich.

72
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,520
What do you think?

73
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,680
I think that's a great idea.

74
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,400
Brother Chong, we've bet on the Ghost Army once.

75
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,520
It's not like we lost this time.

76
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,600
That's right.

77
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,320
You didn't get a result for half a day.

78
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,800
Why don't you bet on it?

79
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,800
It depends on whether God will let Yao Shuliang go or not.

80
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,480
I'll let you decide.

81
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,920
What do you think?

82
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,840
You don't dare to bet, do you?

83
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,200
Don't be so mean.

84
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,040
I'm not afraid.

85
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,000
it's fine, I'll go back.

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:49,220
The

87
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,980
I'm willing to accept the bet.

88
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,060
Let him go.

89
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,580
Everyone, I'll take the punishment for what I did today.

90
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,700
I, Jiang Wenhuan, will take the responsibility.

91
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,820
Let's go.

92
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,820
Miss A-Sid, you're so impulsive.

93
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,260
It seems that I, the king of gambling...

94
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,540
What are you saying, Young Master Jin Xia?

95
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,140
I don't understand.

96
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,500
You don't understand?

97
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,660
Forget it then.

98
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,220
The King of Gambling

99
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,900
This is the communication order.

100
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,980
Go and return quickly.

101
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,460
Brothers and sisters.

102
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,380
I, Yao Shuliang, owe you all today.

103
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,180
I will surely repay you with my life.

104
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,220
The King of Gambling

105
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,300
Take care.

106
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,700
Take care.

107
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,500
Go and return quickly.

108
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,500
Go and return quickly.

109
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Take care.

110
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,180
Go.

111
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,380
Kneel.

112
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,060
You people of Eastland are indeed very cunning.

113
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,300
You used a fake city defense map as bait

114
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,300
and made our Ghost Realm fall into a trap.

115
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,260
Who can blame for being a coward?

116
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,740
Even if you succeed this time

117
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,700
and get the city defense map

118
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,700
don't think of taking my Eastland at all.

119
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,780
The winner is decided.

120
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,980
The winner will be decided by the general.

121
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,900
General Bogu thinks that

122
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,300
our Eastland

123
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,620
can only be established in the borderland

124
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,620
by this dense city defense map.

125
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,580
What else?

126
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,580
That's right.

127
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,900
The city defense map made by the He Luo disciple

128
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,820
is indeed the strength of our Eastland.

129
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,220
But our Eastland has been built for hundreds of years.

130
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,900
It's the Eastland warriors

131
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,100
who have been born and raised in the face of death.

132
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,900
This is the key to our Eastland.

133
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,900
It's a pity that you Ghost Realm will never be able to do it.

134
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,900
But I still have one thing that is unclear.

135
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,900
I want to ask you to answer me.

136
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,500
The Ghost Realm and the Eastland are indeed attacking and invading.

137
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,300
This time, you have made great efforts

138
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,100
to set up traps

139
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,100
and even tried to disturb the peace of our Prince Camp.

140
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,900
It's indeed unlike the Ghost Realm.

141
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,100
What do you mean?

142
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,500
Could it be that

143
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,500
there is another expert behind General Bogu's back?

144
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,300
You...

145
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,700
Who is it?

146
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,700
Chase after him!

147
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,700
Chase after him!

148
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,700
Hurry!

149
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,500
The person behind this is very suspicious.

150
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,300
It seems that this matter is not that simple.

151
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,500
Oh no!

152
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,500
Hua!

153
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,900
Hua!

154
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,700
She's awake again.

155
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,500
My quote from yesterday Tsubasa Shinobu

156
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:30,340
It's not a new

157
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,620
What a god

158
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,400
How to bite

159
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,660
Two

160
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,420
Be careful!

161
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,020
I'll send you to hell!

162
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:05,940
Han Shou!

163
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,860
Xiu, don't move!

164
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,380
Be careful!

165
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,660
Be careful!

166
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,620
There's no one here.

167
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,900
Where did you get the sword?

168
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:37,980
Could it be

169
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,380
that this is the skill of the Qimen Dunjia

170
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,380
that Master mentioned?

171
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,300
What is it?

172
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,300
The Qimen Dunjia

173
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,820
is an ancient weapon

174
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,220
that is used in the formation of the army.

175
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,140
The main eight gates

176
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,180
are

177
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,620
Xiu, Sheng, Shang, Du, Jing, Si, Jing, Kai.

178
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:55,700
If you break in,

179
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,140
the secret weapons will be triggered.

180
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,220
It's a matter of life and death.

181
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,460
Who set up such a formation

182
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,100
to capture us?

183
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,020
Could it be the Guifeng people?

184
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:06,820
I don't know.

185
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:08,620
But

186
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,740
the stone tablet we just saw

187
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,380
should represent one of the directions.

188
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,460
Each direction

189
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,580
represents a gate.

190
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,260
Only by finding the gate

191
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,300
can we break in.

192
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,820
You'll break in.

193
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,140
Brother Jiang, how sure are you?

194
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,580
Not even a single one.

195
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,340
It's over.

196
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,140
Brother Zhang,

197
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,020
today, the two of us

198
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,220
are destined to die together.

199
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,980
Can we find the holy gate?

200
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,260
Let's try it.

201
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,620
This is the Mao clan.

202
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,180
The sunrise is the east.

203
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,820
The east gate is where the Shang gate is.

204
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,420
This is the Shang gate.

205
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,460
Look.

206
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,580
There are stone tablet in the east.

207
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,060
The north gate is empty.

208
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,060
It's where the Shang gate is.

209
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,900
There must be a mechanism.

210
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:14,780
It's true.

211
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,260
This is the Shang gate.

212
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,020
The sword rain came from this direction.

213
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,020
The Shang gate is the same as the earth.

214
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,940
It's in the northeast.

215
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,460
The stone tablet of the Shang gate

216
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,100
should be between the two.

217
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,260
I can't see anything.

218
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,860
I'm getting stronger.

219
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,500
Look.

220
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,020
There's another stone tablet.

221
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,140
That's right.

222
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,700
Between the two,

223
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,180
there's the holy gate.

224
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,180
Great.

225
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,420
You're really a hero, Jiang Xiao.

226
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,420
Take the formation.

227
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,820
Break the gate together.

228
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,220
Why is the sword rain coming out?

229
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,780
The method to break the gate is wrong.

230
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,020
Jiang Xiao, there's a trick here.

231
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,820
It seems that we can't break it from the inside.

232
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,300
From the inside?

233
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,340
What about from the outside?

234
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,420
Yes.

235
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,820
Someone broke it from the outside.

236
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:26,940
Maybe we can break it.

237
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,860
The sound of the flute.

238
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,020
The sound of the flute.

239
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,220
Why is there a sound of the flute here?

240
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,780
Our Eastland Army

241
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,940
calls it the sound of the flute.

242
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,860
The sound of the flute is the sound of the world.

243
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,100
The sound of the flute.

244
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,100
The sound of the flute is the sound of the world.

245
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,860
Did Jiang Xiao and the others

246
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,660
get into trouble?

247
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,220
The sound of the flute.

248
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,380
The sound of the flute.

249
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,580
The sound of the flute.

250
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,540
What should I do?

251
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,900
The motherland is in danger.

252
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,260
But I can't

253
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,580
just sit back and watch.

254
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,180
I don't believe it.

255
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,700
What should I do?

256
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:38,860
Let it go.

257
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,260
Let it go.

258
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,660
Let go!

259
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:45,980
Let go!

260
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,420
Let go!

261
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,140
Let go!

262
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,020
Let go!

263
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,460
Let go, let go!

264
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,460
Let go!

265
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,100
Let go!

266
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,280
I can't hold it in Бenerе

267
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,320
It's him

268
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,780
A girl in the woods

269
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,540
The animal mom are here

270
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,620
After I kill the goat

271
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,880
I'll sit and wait in the sequoia

272
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,660
To....

273
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,880
This golem

274
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,480
This is the north

275
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,060
This is right

276
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,180
Sha!

277
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:53,700
Two frost clamps are a

278
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,580
Thanktrall-They are up there

279
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,300
Get them all Scott

280
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,300
Either way

281
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,420
We should turn a fullback around

282
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:01,460
Go

283
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:03,580
Hurry

284
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,620
But it's going to rain

285
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,460
Dao

286
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,780
Dao

287
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,180
What are they not crying for?

288
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:20,780
Dad

289
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,460
What are they?

290
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,340
Not bad.

291
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,780
It's convenient to come at a critical time.

292
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,340
Yeah.

293
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:27,940
Yeah.

294
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,020
I didn't expect you to come back.

295
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:29,580
Yeah.

296
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,340
Yeah.

297
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,180
Thanks to you.

298
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:31,580
Yeah.

299
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,180
Thanks.

300
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:52,040
Little

301
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,620
Could I

302
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,620
beg for order

303
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,860
in case…

304
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:14,740
How could this happen?

305
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,300
Eagle Eaters.

306
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,140
You're just flippant and easy going.

307
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,700
Why are you so friendly?

308
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,700
I'm sorry.

309
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,700
I didn't expect

310
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,700
that I would harm everyone.

311
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,700
Brother Jiang,

312
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,700
I must go back to the Mo State.

313
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,700
My father

314
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,700
and my mother

315
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,700
were all taken by Guanyun.

316
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,700
Promise me

317
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,700
that you will go back to the Mo State.

318
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,700
Okay.

319
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,700
I promise you

320
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,700
that I will send you back

321
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,700
and take the throne for your Mo State.

322
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,700
I will not disappoint you

323
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:20,700
and will not disappoint you.

324
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,700
I will not disappoint you.

325
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,700
Mother

326
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,700
is still young.

327
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,700
Little Red Riding Hood!

328
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,700
Little Red Riding Hood!

329
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,700
Brother Yang!

330
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,700
Mother

331
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,700
Little Red Riding Hood!

332
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,700
I, Jiang Wenhuan,

333
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,700
ask for your order to go to war.

334
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,700
I will go to the Mo State

335
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,700
and save the Queen of Mo State.

336
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,700
I, Eishun, ask for your order to go to war.

337
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,700
Xinjia,

338
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,700
ask for your order to go to war.

339
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,700
Tao Yanzhong, Wang Yuanji, Zun Yuanxiao,

340
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,700
Tai Tian, ask for your order to go to war.

341
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,700
Chong Yibiao,

342
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,700
what about you?

343
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,700
Do you know

344
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,700
that His Majesty has ordered

345
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,700
that all the troops

346
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,700
are not allowed to send troops without permission?

347
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,700
If you go to war,

348
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,700
you will break the rules.

349
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,700
But today,

350
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,700
you are not only soldiers of our Eagle Division,

351
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,700
but also brothers of Yao Shuliang

352
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,700
who dare to challenge us.

353
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,700
In this battle,

354
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,700
you are brothers

355
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,700
who dare to challenge us.

356
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,700
In this battle,

357
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,700
you are brothers

358
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,700
who dare to challenge us.

359
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,700
You have nothing to do with us.

360
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,700
Whether you live or die,

361
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,700
it's up to the fate.

362
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,700
Thank you, General Jiang.

363
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,700
Thank you, General Jiang.

364
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,700
Get up.

365
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,700
Huan,

366
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,700
be careful.

367
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,700
Come back safely.

368
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,700
Let's go.

369
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,700
Go.

370
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,700
My father and mother

371
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,700
were all bitten by the ghost.

372
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,700
Promise me

373
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,700
that you won't

374
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,700
let me die.

375
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,700
I promise you

376
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,700
that I won't

377
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,700
let you die.

378
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,700
I promise you

379
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,700
that I won't

380
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,700
let you die.

381
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,700
Brother.

382
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,700
Brother.

383
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,700
Kill.

384
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,700
Kill.

385
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,700
Kill.

386
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,700
Father and mother,

387
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,700
I'm glad to see you.

388
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,700
Since the spring of this year,

389
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,700
we have been apart for months.

390
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,700
I miss you so much.

391
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,700
Everything is fine in Eastland.

392
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,700
Father and mother are worried about you.

393
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,700
I have been timid since I was a child.

394
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,700
I don't have many friends around me.

395
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,700
I know that going to Eastland alone

396
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,700
is like breaking into the desert alone

397
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,700
and worrying about my son.

398
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,700
I can't rest or cry

399
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,700
when I'm not at ease.

400
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,700
I don't know

401
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,700
where to go

402
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,700
when I'm not at ease.

403
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,700
However, the brothers in the camp

404
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,700
treat me very well.

405
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,700
They treat me like their own children.

406
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,700
I'm very grateful.

407
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,700
Brother Jia is a kind man.

408
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,700
He is very kind.

409
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,700
I feel very close

410
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,700
when I enter the camp.

411
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,700
Brother Le is very kind.

412
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,700
He is very kind.

413
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,700
I feel very grateful.

414
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,700
Brother Chong is cold-hearted.

415
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,700
But he is brave and cruel.

416
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,700
He is like a fire.

417
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,700
And Jiang Sheng.

418
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,700
He dares to take two steps.

419
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,700
He is very brave.

420
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,700
He is more tired and tired.

421
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,700
I feel very grateful.

422
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,700
The brothers in the camp have all been overtaken.

423
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,700
They are very good.

424
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,700
But fighting with them

425
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,700
makes me feel very sad.

426
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,700
I believe

427
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,700
when we go back to our hometown,

428
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,700
the people standing in front of our parents

429
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,700
will no longer be like the old Xibai.

430
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,700
They will be the real

431
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,700
men who will fight against the world.

432
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,700
The book is short and strange.

433
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,700
It's not as good as the prophecy.

434
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,700
I hope that the others

435
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,700
can return to their hometown

436
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,700
and be filial.

437
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,700
I hope that my parents

438
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,700
and my sister can reunite soon.

439
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,700
Therefore,

440
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,700
I hope that

441
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,700
the second brother will be able to fight against the world.

442
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,700
Thank you, young heroes.

443
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,700
My son can fight with you

444
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,700
in this life.

445
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,700
He can die without regrets.

446
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,700
The End

447
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,700
I caused it.

448
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,700
Drink it.

449
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,700
I shouldn't have let him come back.

450
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,700
If you didn't let him come back,

451
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,700
he might be in Yaogu now

452
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,700
and eat with his family

453
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,700
the food made by his mother

454
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,700
and chat with his family.

455
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,700
But guess what?

456
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,700
Will he remember

457
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,700
the dozens of brothers

458
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,700
who died on the East Road?

459
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,700
In the rest of his life,

460
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,700
will he not question himself

461
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,700
for a moment?

462
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,700
I could have saved them.

463
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,700
Why didn't I?

464
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,700
I didn't want to die.

465
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,700
I didn't want to die.

466
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:06,700
It's not easy to live and die.

467
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,700
But sometimes,

468
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,700
it's harder to live than to die.

469
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,700
When the people around you

470
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,700
all die in front of you,

471
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,700
but you can't do anything about it,

472
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,700
when you're in danger,

473
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,700
you can only remember their faces

474
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,700
in the night

475
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,700
Remember,

476
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,700
Kun's Army will never be defeated.

477
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,700
Kun Wu.

478
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,700
Get down.

479
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,700
When those smiles

480
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,700
always appear in front of you,

481
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,700
you can't escape

482
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,700
and you can't forget them.

483
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,700
The world knows

484
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,700
you have no way out

485
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,700
and no home.

486
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,700
You said

487
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,700
you want to live alone.

488
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,700
Is that okay?

489
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,700
Brother,

490
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,700
I've known you for so long.

491
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,700
Suddenly, I feel

492
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,700
I don't know you that well.

493
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,700
Really?

494
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,700
At first,

495
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,700
I thought

496
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,700
you were the noble prince

497
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,700
of the southern capital.

498
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,700
But later I found

499
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,700
although you respect Chu You,

500
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,700
you have Qiu He in your heart.

501
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,700
You're the most beautiful girl in the world.

502
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,700
I admire you.

503
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,700
But recently,

504
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,700
I feel

505
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,700
I know you

506
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,700
as not the real you.

507
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,700
You're from a noble family.

508
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,700
You're graceful and talented.

509
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,700
But you also have

510
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,700
the rare Cang Cang Lian

511
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,700
and the broad sword skills.

512
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,700
It's like you've been

513
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,700
practicing for years.

514
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,700
Brother,

515
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,700
I've seen you

516
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,700
in the world.

517
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,700
Brother,

518
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,700
you're the most special

519
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,700
and the most contradictory person

520
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,700
I've ever seen.

521
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,700
Sometimes, I even think

522
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,700
you're really just

523
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,700
the prince of the southern capital.

524
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,700
The prince of the eastern capital

525
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,700
is smart and smart.

526
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,700
Don't reveal your identity.

527
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,700
Otherwise,

528
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,700
we'll all be in trouble.

529
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,700
Jiang Xiao Miao, what about us?

530
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,700
No.

531
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,700
It's just my words.

532
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,700
I'm sincere.

533
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,700
I won't lie.

534
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,700
What about you?

535
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,700
Have you ever lied to me?

536
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,700
No.

537
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,700
Jiang Xiao Miao,

538
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,700
you...

539
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,700
I'm just kidding.

540
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,700
You're not a man.

541
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,700
I hope I'm overthinking.

542
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,700
Your Highness.

543
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,700
Ding.

544
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,700
Ding.

545
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,700
Your Highness,

546
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,700
you asked me to come here.

547
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,700
Is there anything wrong?

548
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,700
Ding,

549
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,700
do you remember the slave

550
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,700
I saved last time

551
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,700
in the slave market?

552
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,700
I think I do.

553
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,700
But didn't that guy

554
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,700
run away?

555
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,700
Yes.

556
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,700
Help me investigate this.

557
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,700
See where he is now.

558
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,700
Okay.

559
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,700
None of them are men.

560
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,700
None of them is a human.

561
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,700
I didn't know what was beneath his skin.

562
00:35:54,700 --> 00:36:02,260
We can use

563
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,940
some poison repair times.

564
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,700
Then your sword will be better.

565
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,700
That's my friend.

566
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,700
Send it to me.

567
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,700
Do you have any idea about the last thread?

568
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,700
This sword

569
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,700
is Taiwan's special

570
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,420
Could it be the Guifang clan?

571
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,260
Are they fighting against their own people?

572
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,620
I heard that for years,

573
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:27,460
there have been two clans of the Guifang clan fighting each other.

574
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:30,940
General Fugui's five ministers have been fighting each other.

575
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,100
They have suppressed the old nobility's power.

576
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,860
But this time, the Guifang clan has lost.

577
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:40,580
I'm sure the five ministers have been separated.

578
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:45,180
It seems that the Eastern Continent has been taken as a sword.

579
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:50,060
It has become a tool to suppress the Guifang clan's power.

580
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,380
You mean...

581
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,380
General Fugui has been used by others too?

582
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,980
He can use General Fugui as a sword against the Eastern Continent.

583
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:03,180
He has defeated the five ministers' power and can suppress the Eastern Continent.

584
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,180
He has joined forces with Marquis Ning to make the Crown Prince Camp restless.

585
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:10,660
It seems that this person who can call the storm in the Guifang clan

586
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,900
is not that simple.

587
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:19,180
Have you heard that in the past two years,

588
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:23,180
the Guifang clan has been showing off their skills?

589
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,580
Not really.

590
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,780
How is the Eastern Marquis's house?

591
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,380
Don't worry, Young Master.

592
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:39,980
The Guifang clan's five ministers' power has already suppressed the old nobility's power.

593
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:43,180
The Eastern Continent won't investigate anymore.

594
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,180
That's good.

595
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:53,180
Soon, the Crown Prince Camp will be lively again.

596
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:19,180
zhėer

597
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:35,780
What are you doing here?

598
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,780
Catch you later.

599
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,780
You have my word.

600
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,440
Time goes by like aabbled

601
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,980
еще,换一支命运的气温

602
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,020
叫唤的行人 vary

603
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,480
退 astray

604
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,760
他的

605
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:32,900
一半

606
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,300
曲

607
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,520
伪

608
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,360
痴分

609
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,320
待

610
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:44,900
年
