1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,040
We will never stop loving each other

2
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,600
We will never give up

3
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,440
We will never stop until we are old

4
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,840
We will never stop until we are old

5
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,860
��pel

6
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,800

7
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:41,500
little

8
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,880
war

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,160
Friedan,忠哲

10
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:15,260
I have left the

11
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,200
Members have remained

12
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,040
that old

13
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,000
testing

14
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,360
It's terrible

15
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,200
Only three of them

16
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,040
Can you do it?

17
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,720
Jiao Xiong, I'm coming!

18
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,040
Monster!

19
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,240
Look at me!

20
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,760
Monster!

21
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,440
Come on! Look at me!

22
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,680
You're a killer!

23
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,040
You can see me first if you're capable!

24
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,640
Come on!

25
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,400
I... I'm warning you!

26
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,320
Don't come over!

27
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,800
I didn't expect you to be so obedient

28
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,480
when you're a monster!

29
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,600
I'm warning you! Don't come over!

30
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,840
Zi Yu

31
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,560
Father

32
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,040
Get up, kid

33
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,480
Are you okay?

34
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,440
I'm fine

35
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,120
But why did you call me out in such a hurry?

36
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,520
Yu'er

37
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,040
You don't have to ask

38
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,200
and don't worry about it

39
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,160
Master, something happened

40
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,680
Some scholars don't know what strategy they used

41
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,080
and have defeated that evil monster

42
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,920
So fast?

43
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,640
Yes

44
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,160
I'm afraid they're not going to make it

45
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,160
I'm afraid they're not going to make it

46
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,160
I'm afraid they're not going to make it

47
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,160
I'm afraid they're not going to make it

48
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,080
So fast?

49
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,280
Follow me

50
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,080
This bronze medal

51
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,040
doesn't look like the one in Marquis Dongwu's mansion

52
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,640
What is that?

53
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,400
ком, com myra

54
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,920
My God

55
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,560
The man on the carriage

56
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,160
The man on the carriage

57
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,480
has certain black Pizza

58
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,640
I can't believe the picture

59
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,480
He's too good

60
00:04:59,480 --> 00:04:59,960
Come on!

61
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,840
Come on!

62
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,840
This picture

63
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,920
Is the person on the carriage

64
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,680
all related to this evil thing?

65
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,140
General Zhang is evennego Xing

66
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,140
Others are here

67
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,320
Let's go back and help my brother

68
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,240
Go

69
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,600
General Shu, how are you

70
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,180
I shall not be sent by them

71
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,320
Where are the monsters

72
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,720
fell off by a single brush

73
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,800
How is it going

74
00:05:46,800 --> 00:06:04,500
Give 230,000 salutes to General

75
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,180
A expose

76
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,800
Give me more

77
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,140
No

78
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,660
It's too late

79
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,380
General

80
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:16,780
Rock on

81
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,800
After all, there are many suspicious people in this fight.

82
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,800
Let's see Brother Jiang.

83
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,200
Where is he?

84
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,400
Why did he disappear after we chased him?

85
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,800
Miss, are you looking for me?

86
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,600
Who are you? Why are you following us?

87
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,800
I want to ask who you are.

88
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,600
How dare you let evil things disturb my Eastland.

89
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,200
Hurry, kill him.

90
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,600
You are a lord of a family.

91
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,600
How can you bully a little girl?

92
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,400
It's not good.

93
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,200
Why is it you?

94
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,000
Brother Jiang.

95
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,200
As for the missed call meaners...

96
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,200
Just He amend those people.

97
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,800
What is your promise?

98
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,280
Little mashed potatoes,

99
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,880
I feel happy to eat it.

100
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,680
Here your crown prince.

101
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,200
Is he a straient?

102
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
So you are the ones who stole the birth certificate

103
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
What did I tell you last time?

104
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
If I see you again

105
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
You can't take this hand and foot

106
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
This time, I will take it with your master

107
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Don't move

108
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
Otherwise I will kill her

109
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
What are you laughing at?

110
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
Of course I am laughing at you guys

111
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
You are stupid

112
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Old man, this girl is a thief

113
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
Do you think I will care about

114
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
The life of a thief?

115
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Jiang Wen Hua?

116
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
You are a bad person

117
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
You can remember such a big thing

118
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Even if I am in hell

119
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
I will take revenge on you

120
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
What's the use of taking revenge on me?

121
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
They are the ones who want to kill you, not me

122
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
They will kidnap me without you

123
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,800
This is your unreasonable

124
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,800
Did I ask you to come?

125
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,800
Did I ask them to hit you?

126
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,800
Did I ask them to kidnap you?

127
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,800
I don't care, it's because of you

128
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,800
It's really not me

129
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,800
It's you again

130
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
Be careful

131
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
Are you okay?

132
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Let's go

133
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
This is not a good thing

134
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
It really hurts

135
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
I will find out the cause and cause

136
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
And give you an explanation

137
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
I think we should report to the king

138
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Please decide

139
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
The king will decide

140
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Yes, let's go to the palace

141
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
Go to the palace

142
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
Wait, calm down

143
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
You want to find justice, right?

144
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
We don't

145
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
If you want to find it, you have to find this person

146
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,800
Ning Bo, who released the monster

147
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
What's going on?

148
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
Everyone, this

149
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
Is found in the box of the monster

150
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
The mark on it

151
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
Is Ning Jia Jiahui

152
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
Right?

153
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Ning Bo, what's going on?

154
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
Ning Bo

155
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
It's really him

156
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,800
It's Ning Bo

157
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,800
Why?

158
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,800
Stop asking

159
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,800
What should I do?

160
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
The king wants me to cut off my grandson

161
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,800
I did this

162
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,800
To stop Dou Shou

163
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
To stop the opening of Zhizi Camp

164
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,800
What? Open Zhizi Camp?

165
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
What?

166
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
I received a secret report a few days ago

167
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,800
The day of the battle

168
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
Is the opening of Zhizi Camp

169
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
How do you want to do it?

170
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
Father

171
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
Do I really want to be like my brother

172
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
To be the Zhizi in the capital?

173
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
The king has killed

174
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
My son

175
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,800
I can't let Ning family

176
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
Cut off his grandson

177
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
The king is really decisive

178
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
I will help you

179
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
I promise

180
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
I will show you my secret

181
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
I will open it

182
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
Father

183
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
Father

184
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
It's all because of the king

185
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
Don't blame me

186
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,800
For being unkind

187
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,800
And being ungrateful

188
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
The emperor is ungrateful

189
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
Lord Gongsun

190
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
Is what your mother said true?

191
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
The king really wants to reopen Zhizi Camp?

192
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
The king really wants to reopen Zhizi Camp?

193
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
The king

194
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
Is going to open Zhizi Camp

195
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
But not Zhizi Camp

196
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
What's the difference?

197
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
Isn't it a hostage?

198
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
Yes, isn't it a hostage?

199
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
Listen to me

200
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
Recently

201
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
The king has been guided by the heaven

202
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
He knows the medicine of immortality has been returned to the world

203
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
And the person who can find it

204
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Is among the princes of the dukes

205
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,800
So the king plans to open Zhizi Camp in East Lugh

206
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
Just to find

207
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
The national treasure that has been lost for many years

208
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
East Lugh?

209
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
You mean Zhizi Camp is not in the capital?

210
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,800
Yes, this is the emperor's first edict

211
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
For the dukes

212
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,800
This

213
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
This is true

214
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
So if Zhizi Camp is in East Lugh

215
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
The lives of the princes are guaranteed

216
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
If you can find the treasure for the king

217
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,800
The king will reward the dukes

218
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
And will take the country

219
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
You are so stupid

220
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
You believe the lies of Yuan Yang?

221
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
You are the fake men

222
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
You are the fake men

223
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Brother Yi

224
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
You are all complaining about Shang Shan

225
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
I am different from you

226
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
I am willing to do what I want

227
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
I am willing to sacrifice my life

228
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
To fight against the evil army

229
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
Ning Bo Hou

230
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,800
You are so talented

231
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
But such a good talent

232
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
You don't go to the capital to fight against the king

233
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,800
You are here to support the innocent

234
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
You are not a real man

235
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,800
Now, just by your guess

236
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
You have such a big trouble

237
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
What's the difference

238
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,800
With the evil army you talk about?

239
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
Your family's life is life

240
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
Others' life is just a grass

241
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Like you

242
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
You are so narrow-minded

243
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
You are so narrow-minded

244
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:45,660
And you are so

245
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,660
Dad

246
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,660
Innocent

247
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,660
As long as you can save my son's life

248
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,660
You all will die

249
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,660
Dad

250
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,660
Zeyu

251
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,660
Leave these people to me

252
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,660
Go

253
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,660
Dad

254
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,660
Zeyu

255
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,660
Zeyu

256
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,660
God wants to kill me

257
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,660
My son is innocent

258
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,660
It's my house

259
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,660
I am not well taken care of

260
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,660
Come back to the city with me

261
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,660
Wait

262
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,660
Dad

263
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,660
Dad

264
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,660
Dad

265
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,660
Dad

266
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,660
Dad

267
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,660
Dad

268
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,660
Dad

269
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,660
Dad

270
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,660
Dad

271
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,660
Dad

272
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,660
Dad

273
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,660
Dad

274
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,660
Dad

275
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,660
Dad

276
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,520
Dad

277
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,520
Dad

278
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,520
If I had found out the truth earlier

279
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,520
If I had not done things on my own

280
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,520
If before the action

281
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,520
I had informed brother the clues in time

282
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:41,520
Will all this be different?

283
00:16:45,660 --> 00:17:05,560
I webinared for you on the

284
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:11,460
next divination

285
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,460
Prince!

286
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,140
Big brother, hit me!

287
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,140
Get out!

288
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,140
You're not allowed to talk here!

289
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,140
Let go of me!

290
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,140
Stop it!

291
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,340
His Majesty has ordered

292
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,340
that although the fight was caused by Marquis Ningbo

293
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,340
the Eastern Wu's House also has the crime of not investigating.

294
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,340
This time, not only will you punish your big brother

295
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,340
but also take back the personally-killed moth

296
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,340
and punish it with the world.

297
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,220
This is the result of the punishment

298
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,220
for the great contribution of the Jiang family.

299
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,340
You are innocent.

300
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,340
You are humiliated.

301
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,340
You are the victim of your past.

302
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,340
You are humiliated!

303
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,340
The glory of the Jiang family, the hero of the Eastland.

304
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,340
I don't know if you will become one day.

305
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,340
But there is one thing

306
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,340
that I am very sure of.

307
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,340
Since the day I met your brothers

308
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,340
you have been the most important person

309
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,340
in my life.

310
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,340
You are the most important person in my life.

311
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,340
This is your brother's pride.

312
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,340
I will prepare some medicine

313
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,340
for my big brother.

314
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,340
I will help you.

315
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:38,340
Please take good care of my big brother.

316
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,340
Get up.

317
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,340
Please hear my message, big brother.

318
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,340
I will not let him down.

319
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,340
The Nicolas family should realize

320
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:34,000
that Emperor Tuberp 이제

321
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,900
wants to give this imperial conspiration

322
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,340
in April.

323
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,340
IClub of Chen reverses controversial thinking

324
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,340
and needs initial consideration.

325
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,340
It was all sudden. It's not what we wanted.

326
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,340
Thank you.

327
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,340
You're welcome.

328
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:53,340
You're the one to choose for everything.

329
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,340
Thank you for helping me.

330
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,340
You saved my life and Shui'er's.

331
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,340
You're being too polite.

332
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:08,340
This is also what Huan'er asked me to give you.

333
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,340
This is...

334
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,340
This is what Huan'er got from the mysterious person who took the imperial edict.

335
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,340
This is the unique bronze mine of Gui Fang.

336
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,340
Gui Fang State?

337
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:23,340
That's right. The monster that appeared in the fight.

338
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,340
If I remember correctly,

339
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:30,340
it should be a ghost master made by the secret arts of Gui Fang.

340
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:34,340
I didn't expect that you would join hands with Gui Fang.

341
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,340
Gui Fang is a Fang state around Eastland.

342
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,340
He hasn't returned to Shu yet.

343
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:43,340
He's been fighting with Eastland for years because of the battle.

344
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,340
But after the great change in Ning Zhou 16 years ago,

345
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,340
Gui Fang has been quiet for many years.

346
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,340
This time, the incident again

347
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,340
might be because my Eastland

348
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,340
is about to open up the Crown Prince's Eagle.

349
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,340
But Gui Fang has always been good at doing many things.

350
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:05,340
The relationship between the ghost master and the imperial edict is not that special.

351
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,340
I'm afraid that there will be a lot of trouble in the future for the Eastland to open up the Crown Prince's Eagle.

352
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,340
The camp will be opened tomorrow.

353
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,340
We can only wait and see.

354
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:19,340
Protect Eastland. Protect the children.

355
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,340
Mother, you're not well.

356
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,340
Go back to your room.

357
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,340
Go back.

358
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:37,340
Child, I'm worried about you.

359
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,340
Brother, this is for you.

360
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:45,340
I hope you can be safe in Eastland.

361
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,340
Mother is not well.

362
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,340
You have to be filial to me.

363
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,340
I'm leaving, father.

364
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,340
Go back.

365
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,340
Don't worry.

366
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,340
Take care of yourself.

367
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,340
What are you looking at?

368
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,340
No one came to the North Marquis's Mansion?

369
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,340
You're jealous?

370
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,340
No one came to West Chuan either.

371
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:14,340
It seems that we are both very unlucky.

372
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,340
In the future, in the Crown Prince's Eagle,

373
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,340
we can only warm each other up.

374
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,340
Let go.

375
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,340
He's always pulling a face.

376
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,340
Brother, warm each other up.

377
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,340
After entering the camp,

378
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,340
I can't accompany you anymore.

379
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,340
Your Heir Apparent and I have an agreement.

380
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,340
As long as I help him,

381
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,340
he will help me find my sister.

382
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,340
Childe, don't worry.

383
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:10,340
As long as you stay in the Eagle's Eagle,

384
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:14,340
one day, you will be able to return to your original self.

385
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:18,340
He didn't mention the Eagle's Eagle before.

386
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:23,340
It shouldn't be too late to mention it now.

387
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:28,340
I don't want to agree.

388
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,340
Childe, do you think

389
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,340
you still have a choice?

390
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,340
Childe is a smart person.

391
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,340
He should understand

392
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,340
that once the plan to steal food and exchange for help begins,

393
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,340
he can't turn back.

394
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,340
Otherwise, the situation will be exposed.

395
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:54,340
You and my master are both dead.

396
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,340
My sister, how is she now?

397
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,340
Is she alive or dead?

398
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:08,340
Your sister is still alive.

399
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:16,340
But sometimes, being alive is more painful than being dead.

400
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,340
Childe, don't worry.

401
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,340
As long as you keep your promise,

402
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:25,340
I will help you save your sister.

403
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,340
Wu Er, live on.

404
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,340
Take care of Qingqing.

405
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,340
Ayi!

406
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,340
Ayi!

407
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,340
Ayi!

408
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,340
Ayi!

409
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,340
Okay, I promise you.

410
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,340
Duanhuang.

411
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,340
Come on, drink with me.

412
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,340
Come on.

413
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,340
Come on.

414
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,340
Why did you drink so much?

415
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,340
I didn't drink much.

416
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,340
This way.

417
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,340
This way.

418
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,340
You want another sip?

419
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,340
Drink.

420
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,340
Jiang Xiong.

421
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,340
Drink less.

422
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,340
I'm drunk.

423
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,340
It's good to be drunk.

424
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,340
Drunk.

425
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,340
You don't have to regret it.

426
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:45,340
Everything that happened at the factory was an accident.

427
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,340
It's not your fault.

428
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,340
I know.

429
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,340
Everyone says so.

430
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,340
It's not my fault.

431
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,340
But you know what?

432
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,340
I'm the son of the Marquis of Dongwu.

433
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,340
I can't lie.

434
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,340
I can't stop Ningbo from being a traitor.

435
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:17,340
In the end, my brother punished me.

436
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,340
Tell me.

437
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,340
Okay?

438
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,340
Tonight, everyone is saying goodbye to their families.

439
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:30,340
I want to say goodbye to someone else too.

440
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,340
Who?

441
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,340
Me.

442
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,340
You?

443
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,340
From now on,

444
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,340
I, Jiang Wenhuan, can't be willful anymore.

445
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,340
I can't be ungrateful anymore.

446
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,340
I can't not understand my brother's pain.

447
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,340
I want to say goodbye.

448
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,340
That guilty person,

449
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,340
that person who can't save himself,

450
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,340
that person who can't save himself.

451
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,340
Okay.

452
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,340
Jin'er, that person who can't save himself.

453
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:26,340
Buy a lantern.

454
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,340
Wait for me.

455
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,340
Buy a lantern.

456
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,340
Uncle.

457
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,340
You want a lantern?

458
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,340
I want a lantern.

459
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,340
Here.

460
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,340
Buy a lantern.

461
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,340
Lantern?

462
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,340
Lantern.

463
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,340
In the southern capital,

464
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,340
if a family passes away,

465
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,340
everyone will use a lantern to pray for their death.

466
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,340
Life is short and endless.

467
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,340
The water is endless.

468
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,340
People hope that this water that is not knowingly precious,

469
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,340
can bring their grief and grief

470
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:34,340
to send their loved ones.

471
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,340
The last journey.

472
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:43,340
What if I send this lantern to save my family?

473
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:47,340
For the sake of the people who will live on.

474
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,340
One who kills for the sake of the living,

475
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,340
one who kills for the sake of the dead.

476
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,340
Very good.

477
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,340
Very good.

478
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,340
The Lion Camp will be opening in Dongwu tomorrow.

479
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,340
What are you planning to do?

480
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:22,340
Looks like Brother Jiang has plans too.

481
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,340
Of course.

482
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:28,340
The Lion Camp was established to find the immortality medicine.

483
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,340
If we can find the medicine,

484
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,340
then...

485
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,340
I want to bring the Jiang family back to glory.

486
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:42,340
I want to make the memorial tablet representing the Jiang family

487
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,340
hang on the doorstep of our family.

488
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,340
Also,

489
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:55,340
I want my big brother to be the master of the Dongwu family.

490
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,340
Brother Jiang has a lot of wishes.

491
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,340
What about you?

492
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,340
Are you going to build a memorial tablet,

493
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,340
protect the country,

494
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,340
fight the US soldiers, or...

495
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:13,340
I want to live on.

496
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,340
Live on?

497
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,340
Okay.

498
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,340
Then let's go to the Lion Camp.

499
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,340
Live on.

500
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,340
Okay.

501
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,340
Okay.

502
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,340
Dongwu, are you drunk?

503
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,340
I know.

504
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,340
I know.

505
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,340
I know.

506
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,340
It's this way.

507
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,340
Are you sure?

508
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,340
I'm sure.

509
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,340
I'm sure.

510
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:02,340
You men are not that good at drinking.

511
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:05,340
Of course you're better than Brother Jiang.

512
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,340
Brother Jiang!

513
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,340
Are you okay?

514
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,340
What is this?

515
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,340
Be careful.

516
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,340
Look.

517
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,340
We have several faces.

518
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,340
We met each other by chance.

519
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,340
We were in a critical situation.

520
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:29,340
But you didn't hesitate to live or die.

521
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,340
Really.

522
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,340
But to be honest,

523
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:44,340
I didn't expect you to save me on the battlefield today.

524
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,340
Didn't Brother Jiang say

525
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,340
that I'm like a friend when I was your age?

526
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,340
You mean Da Huang?

527
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,340
I call you Da Huang.

528
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,340
Do you dare to say yes?

529
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,340
Da Huang.

530
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,340
Da Huang.

531
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:14,340
It's normal to help each other.

532
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:18,340
Didn't Brother Jiang

533
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:22,340
save the one he met by chance?

534
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,340
But it's okay.

535
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,340
I'll take you home tomorrow.

536
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,340
Home?

537
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,340
It's refreshing.

538
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,340
It's refreshing.

539
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,340
We met by chance.

540
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:47,340
We're friends.

541
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,340
But

542
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,340
you saved me today.

543
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:59,340
From now on, you're my brother.

544
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,340
My good brother.

545
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,340
It's not an honor.

546
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,340
It's better to be a man than a man.

547
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,340
Let's be a match.

548
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,340
We're sworn brothers.

549
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,340
Sla...brothers?

550
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,340
Yes.

551
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,340
Slaver.

552
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:22,340
It's a good match to be Da Huang's brother.

553
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,340
You're drunk.

554
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,340
No.

555
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,340
I'm not drunk.

556
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,340
If you keep lying here,

557
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,340
I'll go.

558
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,340
Don't go.

559
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,340
I'm going.

560
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,340
I'm going.

561
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,340
Don't go.

562
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,340
Da Huang.

563
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,340
Don't go.

564
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,340
Brother?

565
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,340
Brother?

566
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,340
How are you?

567
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,340
I'm fine, ...

568
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,340
Are you okay?

569
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,340
Brother.

570
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,340
I'm fine, ...

571
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,340
Brother.

572
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,340
Brother.

573
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,340
Brother!

574
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,340
Brother!

575
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,340
Brother!

576
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,340
Brother!

577
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,340
Brother!

578
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,340
Brother!

579
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,620
and you are in the Marquis of Dongwu's mansion.

580
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,900
You don't want to live anymore?

581
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,100
Today,

582
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,260
I will teach you a good lesson.

583
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,820
I'm afraid that you will be crazy in the future.

584
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,020
Li Laowu.

585
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,700
Hit me.

586
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,700
Hit me.

587
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,380
You all leave.

588
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,260
Yes.

589
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,100
I don't want to hit you.

590
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,340
But your bad temper.

591
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:08,700
Look.

592
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,820
Look at them.

593
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,180
Dad, it's all for your own good.

594
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,500
If you have a good future,

595
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,900
how can I live in the future?

596
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,380
Dad.

597
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,300
I've told you many times.

598
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,140
I don't want to get married.

599
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,340
I want to be your right hand in the future.

600
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,940
I've told you many times.

601
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,180
The Prime Minister of Qian Kun

602
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,700
has his own place.

603
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,180
Don't mention it again.

604
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,700
Dad.

605
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:46,700
And,

606
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,620
don't find out about the Marquis of Dongwu's mansion.

607
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,500
Why?

608
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,780
Those princes are not that simple.

609
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,140
In the future,

610
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,380
don't get mixed up with them.

611
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,380
Silly girl.

612
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:04,580
What do you want?

613
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,980
A girl.

614
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,100
How is it going?

615
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,060
A prince Ning.

616
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,180
Any chance left,

617
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,940
This guy is really smart.

618
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,580
His Majesty will be satisfied.
