1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,960
The love and dreams of love will never end

2
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,520
Never give up on the road of love

3
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,320
Only for the end in each other's hearts

4
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,920
Until the dawn breaks

5
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,920
Never stop

6
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,520
The Long Ballad

7
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,880
The Long Ballad

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Long Ballad

9
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,080
Why is there the Long Ballad in the ball?

10
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,600
Why not?

11
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,560
Why are you still awake?

12
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,560
You are still awake, too

13
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,960
I can't sleep

14
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,120
What?

15
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,760
Are you thinking about the medicine?

16
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,720
The Long Ballad

17
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,720
By the way

18
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,440
You just said

19
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,720
the Long Ballad can never be in the bell

20
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,040
Have you been to the bell?

21
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,640
It's far from my hometown

22
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,400
Of course I haven't been there

23
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,280
You haven't?

24
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,360
I'm just thinking

25
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,900
the bell had been in the mountain

26
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,080
more than ten years ago

27
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,960
But the Long Ballad

28
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,960
It's said that during the time of Sheng An,

29
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:32,960
why did the ancestors of Sheng An hide the sacred objects of Mount Shang in a place that is unsatisfactory?

30
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,960
I found that you have a habit.

31
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,960
When others are in a bad mood, they use their eyes to look around.

32
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,960
You like to stare at others without looking.

33
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,960
Do you?

34
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,960
Yes.

35
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,960
But it doesn't matter.

36
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,960
You said you haven't been there.

37
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
It's true that you haven't been there.

38
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,960
As long as it's what you said, I believe it.

39
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,960
It's just that you have to remember.

40
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,960
As long as you have any worries, don't hide anything from me.

41
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,960
No matter what you want to do, I will do my best to help you.

42
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:27,960
Don't forget that if there is something hidden between brothers,

43
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,960
it will be a big deal.

44
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,960
Okay.

45
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,960
That's right. You are my best brother.

46
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,960
I will take care of you.

47
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,960
How is it? Are you happy?

48
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,960
I'm leaving Donglu soon.

49
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,960
Can you still look after me?

50
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,960
No matter where I go, as long as I have Jiang Wenhuan, I can look after you.

51
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,960
Enough.

52
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,960
By the way, do you have to return Asi's horse whip to him?

53
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,960
Tomorrow.

54
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,960
I have to tell him.

55
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,960
Okay.

56
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,960
This whip was made by my father.

57
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,960
I didn't expect him to come back.

58
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,960
Thank you.

59
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,960
This whip is badly burnt.

60
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,960
I tried my best to repair it.

61
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,960
But I'm afraid it's not as good as Li Lang's craft.

62
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,960
No.

63
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,960
You repaired it very well.

64
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,960
I like it very much.

65
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,960
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,960
I didn't mean to hurt you.

67
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,960
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,960
I'm sorry for Donglu.

69
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,960
I didn't know that Qian Kunxiang was related to Ning Zhou.

70
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,960
I...

71
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,960
You shouldn't bear the grudge of the previous generation.

72
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,960
I'll take you back to Ning Zhou.

73
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,960
Eh?

74
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,960
I can only go back to Ning Zhou.

75
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,960
I can only go back to Ning Zhou.

76
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,960
I can only go back to Ning Zhou.

77
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,960
So I decide to go back to Ning Zhou to find out.

78
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,960
Ning Zhou?

79
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,360
Six years ago, the King sent people to find a place to protect the holy treasure

80
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,000
There is a longevity fairy medicine in Ning Zhou

81
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,840
But we received the King's order today

82
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,440
He said he would let us go to Zhongli to find it

83
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,920
Zhongli

84
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,080
Yes

85
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,600
This longevity fairy medicine

86
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,280
Is it in Ning Zhou or Zhongli?

87
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,760
No matter where this longevity fairy medicine is

88
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,040
What it brings

89
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,200
Is always the blood and the heart

90
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,920
Although 16 years ago

91
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,280
I escaped from the chaos

92
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,880
But I still can't escape the shadow it brought to me

93
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,640
So I decided to go back and see

94
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,040
Find out the truth

95
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,240
It's a good thing

96
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,640
Donglu has been taking care of the Li's Mansion for years

97
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,080
I didn't expect you to have this kind of insight

98
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,000
It's been a few days

99
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,240
I'm really impressed

100
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,640
I'm a person who wants to do big things

101
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,600
Look

102
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,840
So beautiful

103
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,680
You like this

104
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,560
Wait

105
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,720
Hold on

106
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,160
What are you doing?

107
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,480
This...

108
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:21,960
Don't let go

109
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,960
There's no need for

110
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,320
It's okay

111
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,760
Really fancy

112
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,880
This is reallyuspicious

113
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,880
Why not

114
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,240
You are the first one to ignore Tian Îœj declare

115
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,480
Aze

116
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,840
Aze

117
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,480
I don't have time to say I regret it.

118
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,680
Take care.

119
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,140
Qian iced paste.

120
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,720
The ceremony will be open to the whole city.

121
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,360
The ceremony will be a prayer.

122
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,480
The guests will be able to feel the fragrance of the fruit and fragrance.

123
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,440
Half of the ceremony will be passed on.

124
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:22,160
If I could have seen Zi Yu's ghost behind me earlier

125
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,400
things wouldn't have turned out like this.

126
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,600
Brother, I'm sorry.

127
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,160
I'm sorry for my mother and father.

128
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,600
Do you remember when we were in the ritual

129
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,400
Father would say something to us here?

130
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,600
Of course I remember.

131
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,080
For hundreds of years, the Jiang family's descendants

132
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,320
have been the guardians of the world.

133
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,680
Yes. Father also said

134
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,440
the Jiang family protected the Eastland

135
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,960
without fear of power or wealth.

136
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,840
They were not afraid of life and death.

137
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,880
Life is a place of blood and flesh.

138
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,640
Protecting one's homeland.

139
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,160
Death is a place of loyalty and loyalty.

140
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,400
Giving blessings to the people.

141
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,200
Although the ceremony was destroyed

142
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,640
the soul of the Jiang family

143
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,480
will be protected as always.

144
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,160
Giving blessings to the people

145
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,760
is also giving blessings to you.

146
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,200
I've prayed for you on this journey.

147
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,440
You are the only successor of the Jiang family.

148
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,120
The ancestors will protect you.

149
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,800
I'm not the only child of the Jiang family.

150
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,880
The only successor of the Jiang family is you.

151
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,960
You...

152
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,520
Brother, you're scolding me again?

153
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,600
I have to go far today.

154
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,760
Or else, I'll leave this memorial

155
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,320
to the two of us before we meet again.

156
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,440
I promise you.

157
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,880
This time, I will find the Long-Living Immortal Medicine

158
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,080
to build a temple for the Shang Mountain.

159
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,240
Rebuild the ancestral temple of the Eastern Courtyard.

160
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,800
Let the generations of meritorious people

161
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,360
be re-created in the name of the Dongwu House.

162
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,080
Do you still remember

163
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,800
what Father said when he passed on the story of the Long-Living Immortal Medicine?

164
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,560
I remember.

165
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,040
The Long-Living Immortal Medicine of the Jiang family

166
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,720
can kill the enemy's enemies

167
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,960
and seal the evil spirits.

168
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,880
That's right.

169
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,280
The Long-Living Immortal Medicine of the Jiang family

170
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,800
is the king of the hundred soldiers.

171
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,200
It can break through the barrier

172
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,560
and defeat the enemies and the dragon to conquer the world.

173
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,000
But do you know

174
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,560
that the ancestral temple of the Jiang family has been relying on it for a hundred years

175
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,680
but it has never been a mere way to achieve its goal.

176
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,520
It's the courage of the ancestors of the Jiang family

177
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,080
who dared to die and live after it.

178
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,320
They are very brave and brave.

179
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,520
They are very loyal.

180
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,040
For hundreds of years,

181
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,120
the descendants of the Jiang family

182
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,520
have been the heroes of the Jin State.

183
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,240
They have been the heroes of the Jin State.

184
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,280
They have been the heroes of the Jin State.

185
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,280
They have been the heroes of the Jin State.

186
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,000
Even after they died on the battlefield,

187
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,360
there are no remains of the dead.

188
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,840
Only this scar

189
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,520
and the long-lived spirit

190
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,280
are left on the ancestral temple.

191
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,400
Look at the last hot-blooded glory.

192
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,240
Among the best artists of the Jiang family,

193
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,120
there is only a good living soul.

194
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,920
I'll protect you

195
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,400
if you are safe.

196
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
But the soul will last forever.

197
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,400
Take this.

198
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,400
From now on, you are the real warrior of the Jiang family.

199
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:57,400
You must know good and evil, know right and wrong, and stand by your own limits.

200
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,400
The soul of the Jiang family will surely help you to win in battles and achieve great achievements.

201
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,400
Do what you want to do and protect the people you want to protect.

202
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:17,400
The most important thing is that you must return safely.

203
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,400
Let's go.

204
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
I'll send you to the gate.

205
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
The Zhejiang City

206
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,400
Brother, wait for me.

207
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,400
Little rascal, it's not too late to find the medicine.

208
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,400
The so-called treasure of the country is also a piece of cake.

209
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,400
You must be careful.

210
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,400
Okay, I already know.

211
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,400
I will remember your orders.

212
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,400
The Zhejiang City

213
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,400
You are the elite soldiers and generals that I and General Jiang selected.

214
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,400
This trip to the south represents the whole Shizi Camp.

215
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,400
Remember, even though the path is long, it is accompanied by the heart.

216
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
If the heart is determined, it will not be afraid.

217
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,400
No matter what difficulties you encounter on the way,

218
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,400
as long as you are united, you can move forward.

219
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,400
Mr. Gongsun and General Jiang, don't worry.

220
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
We are both trained by the two of you.

221
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,400
We will not lose the face of the Eastland.

222
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Jiang Wenhuan.

223
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
Jiang Wenhuan is here.

224
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
Today, you go with the team.

225
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,400
We will be together in the future.

226
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,400
None of you can be missing.

227
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
I will obey your orders.

228
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,400
Today, we will be together.

229
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,400
We will be together in the future.

230
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,400
Today, we will be together.

231
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,400
We will be together in the future.

232
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,400
Okay, let's go.

233
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,400
Huan'er.

234
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,400
Master.

235
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
I have something to remind you.

236
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,400
This trip is very difficult.

237
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,400
It is very difficult to predict.

238
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,400
Remember to be wise.

239
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Don't let your ancestors die.

240
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Master, what do you mean?

241
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,400
Don't forget the teachings of Ningbo Marquis.

242
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:50,400
The anger of the capital is not something that the Marquis can bear.

243
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:56,400
You must remember that behind you is the whole Eastland.

244
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,400
Go.

245
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,400
Start the horse.

246
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,400
Go.

247
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
The Eastland is closed.

248
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
Let's go.

249
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,400
Look.

250
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,400
What is that?

251
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,400
It is a horse.

252
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
It is a horse.

253
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,400
It is a horse.

254
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
Huan'er.

255
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,400
But...

256
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,400
Now, she is dead.

257
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,400
She did not eat anything.

258
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,400
Let's go.

259
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,400
Let's go.

260
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Huan'er.

261
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
Huan'er.

262
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,400
Let's go.

263
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,400
Let's go.

264
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,400
Let's go.

265
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,400
Let's go.

266
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,300
H modesty and trickery will

267
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:08,940
help us escape from the

268
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:14,620
hands of God of War.

269
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,860
He went to Yu Diana andims light up the alley.

270
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,940
After then he was with Vasham ditung Ø§Ù„Ø¯ÑƒÐºÐ°

271
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,180
Speaking of what burning in my heart

272
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,260
Place a mere justice for yourself

273
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,220
windows

274
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,420
Only slightly

275
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,540
And I don't want to begin this love

276
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,420
Let's make one

277
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,340
joined together

278
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,620
Every time I drink a cup of tea with you,

279
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,620
I feel that I have a lot of potential

280
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,620
and I can do my best to help you.

281
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,620
Even if you like me,

282
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,620
before I came back to the country,

283
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,620
I had to dry your blood.

284
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,620
When you were working in the art industry,

285
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,620
I made you a cup of tea.

286
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,620
But I only want to drink with you.

287
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,620
You are also going to leave?

288
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,620
Don't worry.

289
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,620
When I return to the capital,

290
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,620
I will inform His Majesty

291
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,620
to send the Taotie Army

292
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,620
to protect the children.

293
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,620
The capital is not like the Eastland.

294
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,620
It's cold and rainy.

295
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,620
Take it.

296
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,620
It's not necessary.

297
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,620
In a blink of an eye,

298
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,620
the situation in Annam is already so bad.

299
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,620
Do you still remember

300
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,620
the first time we met?

301
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,620
I'm leaving.

302
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,620
When will you turn back?

303
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,620
I want to say

304
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,620
that if you leave for a long time,

305
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,620
I will be able to see you again.

306
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,620
I will be able to see you again.

307
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,620
I will be able to see you again.

308
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,620
If you leave for a long time,

309
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,620
I will go get more of the medicine

310
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,620
that Anna gave me.

311
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,620
Thank you.

312
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,620
Wu Yu, I...

313
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,620
When the jade flower blooms,

314
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,620
we will meet again.

315
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,620
Go.

316
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,620
The weather this year is colder than in previous years.

317
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,620
But the jade flowers that bloom in autumn

318
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,620
are in full bloom.

319
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,620
Don't be afraid.

320
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,620
I am Jiang Wen Feng,

321
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,620
aged eighteen,

322
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,620
from the Eastland.

323
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,620
I am from a military family.

324
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,620
I have no parents since I was little.

325
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,620
I am fortunate to have the honor of being a son

326
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,620
to the Marquis of Eastland.

327
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,620
I am serving the Eastland now.

328
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,620
The Second Young Master is so arrogant.

329
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,620
He is the first son of the first marquis of Eastland.

330
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,620
He's the first son of the second marquis of the second marquis of Eastland.

331
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,620
You're still so stubborn!

332
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,620
You're so stubborn!

333
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,620
Great General, it's time to marry.

334
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:58,620
I just want to marry the person I love most.

335
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,620
Sir! Sir, wait!

336
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,620
General, why are you here?

337
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,620
Sir.

338
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,620
What do you think of me?

339
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:19,620
General, you saved my life.

340
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,620
I thought...

341
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,620
I thought so.

342
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,620
Stop the carriage! Stop the carriage!

343
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,620
Two years ago, the Eastern Province was in chaos.

344
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,620
I and Gui Fang fought for three days and fell into a trap.

345
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,620
Do you know what I was thinking at that moment?

346
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:00,620
Father, I have Wen Huan, Yi Yao, Cheng Huan, and Xi Xia. I'm not worried.

347
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,620
I was thinking if I died,

348
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,620
would you be sad?

349
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:08,620
Would you forget me? Would you marry someone else?

350
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,620
I don't want you to forget me.

351
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,620
So I used my last strength to get out of the trap.

352
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,620
I was so angry.

353
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,620
I'm Jiang Wen Fang.

354
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:21,620
I'm from the 32nd Eastland of Yan.

355
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,620
I'm the son of Marquis Dong Wu.

356
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,620
I'm serving the Eastland now.

357
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,620
I haven't married yet.

358
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,620
I'm waiting for someone.

359
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,620
I want to take her away,

360
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,620
take her home,

361
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,620
love her,

362
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,620
protect her,

363
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,620
and take care of her child with her.

364
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,620
Chun Hua and Qiu Yue are in the same boat.

365
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,620
They are on the same journey.

366
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,620
They know how to do everything.

367
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:01,620
Actually, you don't have to answer me in a hurry.

368
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,620
But I've thought about it.

369
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,620
No matter what you do now,

370
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,620
no matter where you go,

371
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:14,620
I, Jiang Wen Fang, will never give up.

372
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,620
General.

373
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,620
I didn't expect that

374
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,620
the Crown Prince would lose Zhong Li

375
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:08,620
because of this.

376
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,620
I'm worried that

377
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,620
once Prince Kun Wu enters Zhong Li,

378
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,620
he will know about his sister.

379
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:18,620
Prince, what's your plan?

380
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,620
If that's the case,

381
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,620
I'll go to the capital.

382
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,620
I'll go to the capital.

383
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,620
I'll go to the capital.

384
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,620
I'll go to the capital.

385
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,620
I'll go to the capital.

386
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,620
If that's the case,

387
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,620
I'll send someone to inform Qi Mei

388
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,620
and tell her brother

389
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,620
that he's back.

390
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:41,620
So that they can meet soon.

391
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:45,620
If they meet,

392
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,620
I'm afraid that I'll reveal my identity.

393
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,620
Now, the south capital is in a state of prosperity.

394
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,620
If Prince is weak,

395
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,620
he will find a way to get a job.

396
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,620
The country is in a state of prosperity.

397
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,620
He will enter it with a weak will.

398
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,620
Then the south capital will be in danger.

399
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,620
I've thought about it.

400
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,620
But he helped me this time.

401
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,620
I owe him.

402
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,620
Now, if I let him go back to Zhong Li,

403
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:18,620
I may not be able to stop him.

404
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:22,620
I might as well be a good person.

405
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,620
Let him meet his only family

406
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:29,620
to fulfill my promise to him.

407
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,620
I know.

408
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,620
According to the top secret report,

409
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:40,620
there seems to be a ghost house behind this.

410
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,620
Did you find any clues?

411
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,620
No.

412
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,620
This person is quite mysterious.

413
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,620
The person we sent out

414
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,620
is either missing or missing.

415
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,620
This person is between

416
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,620
the ghost house, Ning Zhou and Dong Ru.

417
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,620
What kind of clues?

418
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,620
What kind of clues?

419
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,620
The clues that are not good for the person.

420
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,620
He is from the ghost house.

421
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,620
It's always right to check the ghost house.

422
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,620
Let's investigate the ghost house.

423
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,620
Yes.

424
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,620
I always feel that

425
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,620
Zhong Li's action this time

426
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,620
will not be easy.

427
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,620
The ghost house.

428
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,620
Did you see it?

429
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,620
Its soul hole is the sun, the moon and the stone.

430
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,620
and the stars will be born.

431
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:59,620
The stars will be born, and the sky will be clear.

432
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,620
The stars will be born, and the sky will be clear.

433
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,620
This is the God's command.

434
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,620
Has anything important happened in Zhongli recently?

435
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,620
The Crown Prince of Shuangshan sent a camp to Zhongli

436
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,620
to find the Long-Lifing Immortal Medicine.

437
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,620
It will come, it will come.

438
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,620
But Gu Xi,

439
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:44,260
you still missed the last part of the star-like

440
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:53,620
The Long-Lifing Immortal Medicine

441
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,620
Here.

442
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,620
The Long-Lifing Immortal Medicine

443
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,620
I'm so hungry.

444
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,620
Yes, I'm so hungry.

445
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,620
After a mountain,

446
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,620
we should be able to get to Zhongli tomorrow.

447
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,620
I heard that Zhongli is a remote place,

448
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,620
but it is a high place.

449
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,620
It's a thousand miles away from the cold and sunny desert.

450
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,620
The Sang Si is not close to it.

451
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,620
Isn't it?

452
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,620
Otherwise, why did I, Shang Shang,

453
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,620
have to take it back

454
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,620
after all the hard work?

455
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,620
Do you know

456
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,620
why Zhongli is so rich?

457
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,620
Why?

458
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,620
It's said that Zhongli is a rich country,

459
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,620
and it's rich in food and clothing.

460
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,620
They are very lucky.

461
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,620
They think it's the will of heaven

462
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,620
that makes Zhongli so rich.

463
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,620
But that's exactly why

464
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,620
Zhongli has a king,

465
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,620
but it's actually the fault of the state teacher.

466
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,620
It's said that the state teacher has boundless power,

467
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,620
but he is the most powerful.

468
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,620
Many years ago,

469
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,620
the general of Zhongli, Kun Ze,

470
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,620
started an army to rebel.

471
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,620
It was the state teacher

472
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,620
who used his power to subdue the thousands of soldiers.

473
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,620
Actually...

474
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,620
What?

475
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,620
What's wrong, Oshun?

476
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,620
Have you heard of Zhongli?

477
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,620
I've studied it a little before I set out.

478
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,620
Then tell us about it.

479
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,620
I heard that

480
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,620
there is a river

481
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,620
that flows through the city

482
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,620
and becomes the Blue Mountain.

483
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,620
The river is blue,

484
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,620
and it flows into the light.

485
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,620
When dusk comes,

486
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,620
the jade and ash scatter on the river surface.

487
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,620
The water is bright.

488
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,620
Wu, over there!

489
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,620
Second Master, I caught it!

490
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,620
Wu, good job!

491
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,620
Go back at night

492
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,620
and let your mother burn it.

493
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,620
Okay, it looks delicious.

494
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,620
What else?

495
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,620
Only these.

496
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,620
I don't know about the others.

497
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,620
What else?

498
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,620
I don't know.

499
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,620
I don't know.

500
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,620
I don't know.

501
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,620
You've said so much.

502
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,620
None of you has said the key point.

503
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,620
What is the key point?

504
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,620
Beauty.

505
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,620
Really.

506
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,620
The legend says that Zhongli State is as beautiful as the clouds.

507
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,620
This time,

508
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,620
I, the young master of Xichuan, will go out of the Jianghu

509
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,620
and take back the beauty.

510
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,620
How is it, Brother Chong?

511
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,620
How about I take you to see the flowers?

512
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,620
No.

513
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,620
Brother Chong,

514
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,620
why are you so ignorant?

515
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,620
You're not into women.

516
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,620
Could it be that

517
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,620
Brother Chong

518
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,620
has something to say?

519
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,620
Right? Did you hear that?

520
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,620
Come here.

521
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,620
Have you ever seen Brother Chong flirt with a woman?

522
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,620
Come here.

523
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,620
No wonder he didn't react

524
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,620
when he danced this for you.

525
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,620
Is it true, Brother Chong?

526
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,620
I really haven't seen Brother Chong flirt with a woman.

527
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,620
I'm going to shut up.

528
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,620
Brother Chong.

529
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,620
Brother Chong, teach him a lesson.

530
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,620
Three.

531
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,620
I'm going crazy.

532
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,620
Crazy.

533
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,620
Go over there.

534
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,620
I told you to drink water.

535
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,620
I'm not going to say it.

536
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,620
I'm not going to say it.

537
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,620
I'm not going to say it.

538
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,620
Brother Chong, be gentle.

539
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,620
I'm not going to say it.

540
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,620
Stop it.

541
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,620
Where did the steam come from?

542
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,620
It's wrong.

543
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,620
It's wrong.

544
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,620
Everyone, cover your noses.

545
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,620
Zhang Qing has a poison.

546
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,620
Hurry.

547
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,620
You Yin, cover your noses.

548
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,620
Hurry.

549
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,620
Go over there.

550
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,620
I can't stand it.

551
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,620
Hurry up.

552
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,620
Go.

553
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,620
Go.

554
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:15,620
The fire in the mortal world has been protected.

555
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:35,620
I know the long-winded youth in this life

556
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:39,620
is most like this.
