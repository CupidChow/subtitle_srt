1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,960
The love and the dreams will never end

2
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,560
We will never give up

3
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,360
Only for the destination in our hearts

4
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,920
Until the dawn breaks

5
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,920
Never stop

6
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,920
Episode 15

7
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,520
How is it?

8
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,320
Is there anyone inside?

9
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:25,880
Is everyone out?

10
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,440
Be careful.

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You guys find a way to wake the others up.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll go in and have a look.

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Okay.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Be careful.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
By the way, Brother Chong.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Don't worry.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
When we arrived, we already had someone to report.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The army will be here soon.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Okay.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Wake up.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Wake up, Brother Chong.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Hurry.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What's wrong with Miss Ba Si?

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's okay.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
She passed out again.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Put it down.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Did you save everyone?

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Almost.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We just didn't find Zi Yu.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Brother E Sheng went back to check.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
He went back?

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Take care of A Si for me.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'll go back and find E Sheng.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Be careful.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Got it.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Anyone else?

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Anyone else?

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Don't even think about leaving.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Don't even think about leaving.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You...

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Let go.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Let go of me.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Let go of me.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Father.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm not filial.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm a coward.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
They all said they'd avenge me.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But in the end, they all lied to me.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Who wants to avenge you?

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Are you from the Ghost Realm?

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Don't ask me because you're a ghost.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm not a ghost.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm a ghost.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm a ghost.

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm a ghost.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm a ghost.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm a ghost.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Don't ask me because you're a ghost.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm a ghost.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm a ghost.

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You're the ones who died.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yes.

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You're unlucky.

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Let's die together today.

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You...

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
A Shuai.

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I won't forgive you again.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I won't forgive you again.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Zi Yu did so much.

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
In the end, he even sacrificed himself.

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's just for revenge.

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Do you know that your sister is still alive?

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You lived for years

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
just to return to your homeland

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
to see your old friend.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
When everything you love is taken away from you,

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,800
I don't know

81
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,000
what you left behind

82
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,160
is revenge

83
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,000
But hatred is like a maze

84
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,520
You tend to forget yourself

85
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,800
Where did it come from?

86
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,680
Is it really worth it?

87
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,960
But there are too many unworthy things in this world

88
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,720
You need to experience it yourself

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,920
before you understand

90
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,280
Although Ziyu is angry

91
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,360
she is also pitiful

92
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,000
Let her go back to Ning Zhou

93
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,480
Eeshun

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,960
can you still take care of your studies?

95
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,600
I shouldn't be so benefitted to you

96
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Life is very factions

97
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,680
Can you Lis?

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,900
Do we have to leave now?

99
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,300
Hurry!

100
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,200
Park your bike please.

101
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,800
It's really efectoch�도!

102
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,800
Park your bike please.

103
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,000
Why am I late?

104
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,800
As for his mother...

105
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,140
Is that what she does?

106
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,300
She works at a botanical wild China.

107
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,700
She lets some men and women oftenrob her.

108
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,900
Some are pretty scary.

109
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,820
It's also the noble good of our Jiang będzie

110
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,900
that suffers for people and community

111
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,460
Great

112
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,820
You come all the way

113
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,380
and ended up in such auated

114
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,020
It's my fault of being a eternally idiot

115
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,380
General Jiang, don't take that too seriously

116
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,740
We have to hope that the death totally depends on your fancy

117
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,940
I'm deeply sorry.

118
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,220
Thank you for your understanding.

119
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,940
Thank you for finding out the murderer

120
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,780
who killed my husband for Li Bei.

121
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,660
Please help my husband to get justice.

122
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,860
You're welcome, my lord.

123
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,580
You two came here

124
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,020
and killed your father in Donglu.

125
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,660
I'm sorry for that.

126
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,300
I hope Li Bei will not mind the past

127
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,700
and live in the past with Donglu.

128
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,020
Don't worry, general.

129
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,260
I know the background of the matter

130
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,060
and the source of the North Marquis.

131
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,460
I'm glad to see

132
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,540
your innocence.

133
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,060
I'll tell him

134
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,140
to work with Donglu in the future

135
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,220
to protect the mountain.

136
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,380
Thank you.

137
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,140
Please don't mind it.

138
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,540
Take care, general.

139
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,780
I'll leave now.

140
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,380
Take care, my lord.

141
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,180
It's such an important time.

142
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,700
I didn't expect

143
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,260
Mo anti-Japanese uprising this year

144
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,260
to be ruined by me.

145
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,620
I feel sorry for Donglu.

146
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,780
My lord

147
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,980
You've done your best

148
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,820
to protect the history of this country.

149
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,180
Everyone's safety

150
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,500
is what's most important.

151
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,380
These years,

152
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,340
Prime Minister Qian Kun has been colluding with Marquis Ning

153
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,300
to sell weapons and sell the private army.

154
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,900
Selling weapons and selling the private army

155
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,540
is a big crime.

156
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,940
This Li Lao is not related to Marquis Ning.

157
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,740
Why would he risk his life

158
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,180
to sell his life for him?

159
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,500
Maybe there are some reasons

160
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,180
between them that we don't know.

161
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,620
Now the people we know are gone.

162
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,100
You don't know many things.

163
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,500
Or maybe

164
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,380
Ning Zi Yu mentioned to him before he died

165
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,500
that the person who helped him to take revenge

166
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,380
is not only Li Lao.

167
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,620
Could it be that that person is also like Li Lao?

168
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,780
He is the old man of Marquis Ning?

169
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,860
Who do you think it is?

170
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,180
Since the opening of the Crown Prince's Camp,

171
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,100
I have always had a feeling

172
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,940
that the Gui Fang people's identity

173
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,500
has been hidden behind the scenes.

174
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,180
You are saying that the Gui Fang people did this?

175
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,500
I am not sure.

176
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,300
The most important thing is

177
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,100
how you are going to deal with the Li family.

178
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,580
According to the law of Eastland,

179
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,980
colluding with the rebels,

180
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,980
killing Chong Yi Wu,

181
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,580
and killing all the court officials.

182
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,980
But Li Lao is risking his life to change his fate.

183
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,060
Okay.

184
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:21,820
kill the pinned

185
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,820
Endon couldn't figure it out.

186
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,820
Why are you here?

187
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,180
General Qiang is going to investigate Li's family.

188
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,020
I'll go there with my own hands.

189
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,260
You...

190
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,260
I understand.

191
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,540
The law is against the law.

192
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,540
I can't be selfish.

193
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,060
But I'm worried.

194
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,940
I'm worried that A-Si...

195
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,220
Go.

196
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,380
Take good care of Miss A-Si.

197
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,940
Thank you, brother.

198
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,220
Father.

199
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,220
I can't go out.

200
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,260
Why are you standing here?

201
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,060
Take A-Si out.

202
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,820
Father.

203
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,940
I can't take care of you anymore.

204
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,100
I want to live

205
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,300
no matter what happens.

206
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:10,940
Father.

207
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,820
Where is my father?

208
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,420
Father.

209
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:58,940
Miss.

210
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:00,940
Miss.

211
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,220
It's impossible.

212
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,580
But he will protect me for the rest of my life.

213
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,780
I must ask his permission to do it.

214
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,460
Yes.

215
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,580
Let's withdraw.

216
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,060
OK.

217
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,620
Li Si, hereby orders

218
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,860
General,

219
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,780
what happened?

220
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,540
By the order of General integrate,

221
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,540
Li Wu, heated between death and oppression on the Eastland Cityiana kill

222
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,820
and really killed decedentgins,

223
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,620
the killed Jiuying Wu with sword

224
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,580
Wirtschaft

225
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,940
Asen

226
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,700
Miss

227
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,100
Let her go

228
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,980
What's wrong with me today?

229
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,860
Nothing.

230
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:21,680
Take care of your wedding

231
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,120
I need this to build myself a proper family.

232
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,020
How about this.

233
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,020
As for others,

234
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:18,660
fortress

235
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,860
the gift that you gave me,

236
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,460
One string is enough.

237
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,460
You should choose the one you like.

238
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,060
Father.

239
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,860
Let's go home.

240
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,060
Come on.

241
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,660
What is this?

242
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,660
The monster stone has been dug out.

243
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,260
Please have a look.

244
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,460
Wuyi, what is this?

245
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,660
Why is it out of the ground?

246
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:33,260
Is this the legendary blood crystal stone?

247
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,860
Blood crystal stone?

248
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,660
What is blood crystal stone?

249
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,260
Hua'er, you don't know it's also common sense.

250
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,460
It's said that the blood crystal stone has been in the world for a hundred years.

251
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,860
No one has seen it.

252
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,460
I only know one or two in ancient times.

253
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,460
It's said that the blood crystal stone was born in the Eastland and grew in the desert.

254
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,460
It's as red as a red

255
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,660
and it can be solidified with the blood of the body.

256
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,260
So it's called the blood crystal stone.

257
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,460
That's right.

258
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,260
It's good for the living.

259
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,860
But it can make the body full of ink.

260
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,460
So the people of the Eastland

261
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,660
used a fire to completely destroy it

262
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,060
a hundred years ago

263
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,860
to protect the bones of ancestors.

264
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,460
It has been passed down for a hundred years.

265
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,860
I didn't expect it to appear again in my Eastland.

266
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,060
I didn't expect that there is a stone in the world

267
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,660
that was made from the bones of the body.

268
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,860
There are so many things in the world.

269
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,860
Everything is born and goes.

270
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,460
Naturally, there are some unknowable fruits.

271
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,060
So it's said that the dead people used the body

272
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,260
to make up for the blood crystal stone.

273
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,260
That's why these blood crystal stones are scattered.

274
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,060
That's right.

275
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,060
So what should we do now?

276
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,860
We must eliminate it now.

277
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,260
Why?

278
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:56,060
It's said that there is a reason for eliminating it now.

279
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,660
The only way is to dig to the root

280
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,260
and then completely eradicate it.

281
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,660
General Jiang,

282
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,460
we found this when we were eliminating the stone.

283
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,460
Blindfold cafe

284
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,660
Isn't this the testament from the late Director Sheng An?

285
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,860
The Eastern pathway and the other parts of the hydrogen frame,

286
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,060
I &A Jean acted together to assist them to complete the menu.

287
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,460
But It is destined to Registration and forever Opinion.

288
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,660
I ask the Eastern pathway & steward to guard the blood crystal stone.

289
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,060
This is a serious matter.

290
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,900
It concerns the memory of the Prince.

291
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,220
Please remember,

292
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,500
the time when the Long-Living Deity wants to return to the mortal world

293
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,700
is the time of the Blood Crystal Stone and the time of the Immortal World.

294
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,020
If Uncle Zhao said that the Blood Crystal Stone has appeared,

295
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,500
then the Long-Living Deity will also appear.

296
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,300
Didn't he say where the Long-Living Deity is?

297
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,300
He didn't mention it.

298
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,500
If Donglu was ordered to guard the Blood Crystal Stone for generations,

299
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,300
then why would he burn it and bring it to the forbidden 100 years ago?

300
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,300
Perhaps it wasn't burnt.

301
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,300
Instead, he left some powder under the statue of the Immortal.

302
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:27,300
Perhaps this is the best way to protect the Blood Crystal Stone.

303
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,300
Master means that although the Blood Crystal Stone is used to nourish the body,

304
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,300
the common people think that it is inevitable,

305
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,300
but my ancestor Donglu was ordered to protect it.

306
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,300
Even if the powder is buried,

307
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,300
it won't easily reappear.

308
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,300
It's very dangerous.

309
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,300
This way, it will not only increase the king's life,

310
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,300
but also protect the crystal stone.

311
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,300
That's right.

312
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,300
The memorial is a sacred place.

313
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,300
No one will be there to kill.

314
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,300
But what does the Long-Living Deity's medicine have to do with the Blood Crystal Stone?

315
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,300
I always feel that Uncle Zhao is not a fool.

316
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,300
And it seems to have been torn.

317
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,300
I don't know what the other half wrote.

318
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,300
Although only half,

319
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,300
it's still a victory.

320
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,300
It's been ten years.

321
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,300
The Long-Living Deity's medicine has finally a new beauty.

322
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,300
Master, Big Brother, why are you not happy?

323
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,300
We have clues to the Long-Living Deity's medicine.

324
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,300
Sixteen years ago,

325
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,300
Ningbo Marquis was looking for the Deity's medicine.

326
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,300
He almost killed the people.

327
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,300
He said,

328
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,300
Si Er,

329
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,300
I made you a long-living chirn

330
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,300
to make you a lot longer!

331
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,300
You're hungry?

332
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,300
Okay.

333
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,300
Okay.

334
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,300
I'll go get you something to eat.

335
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,300
Miss, you haven't eaten since you woke up.

336
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,300
I made some porridge.

337
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,300
Drink some.

338
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,300
I'm not hungry.

339
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,300
Miss,

340
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,300
you should eat something.

341
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,300
I'll leave first.

342
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

343
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,300
I deserve to die.

344
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

345
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,300
I deserve to die.

346
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

347
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,300
I deserve to die.

348
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

349
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,300
I deserve to die.

350
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,300
I deserve to die.

351
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,300
I deserve to die.

352
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,300
I deserve to die.

353
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,300
Leave.

354
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,300
Si Er,

355
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,300
I no longer have any idea.

356
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,580
Some words are hard to express in person,

357
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,100
so I wrote a letter.

358
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,660
I hope one day,

359
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,300
you can know your real identity.

360
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,380
Sixteen years ago,

361
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,020
a rare word was found on the mountain.

362
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,420
The holy treasure of the protection of the country,

363
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,820
the immortality medicine,

364
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,740
was found in Tushan Village in Ningzhou.

365
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,180
So, the mountain order

366
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,500
ordered Ningbo Marquis of Ningzhou

367
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,420
to go to Tushan Village.

368
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,380
The mountain order ordered Ningbo Marquis of Ningzhou

369
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,300
to search for the immortality medicine.

370
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,420
At that time, Li Laowu

371
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,580
was just a guard of the bandits.

372
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,420
He usually took a group of brothers

373
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,420
to rob the nobles' houses and eat.

374
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,860
When he met the officers and soldiers chasing after him,

375
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,340
he separated with his brothers

376
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,340
and accidentally fell into Tushan.

377
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,020
He had no choice but to

378
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,900
find some white stuff in Tushan Village

379
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,940
and unexpectedly witnessed the death

380
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,980
of the Tushan clan.

381
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,180
No!

382
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,380
I'll spare your lives!

383
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,100
Tushan has an ancestral order.

384
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,660
The immortality medicine will appear and the world will be in chaos.

385
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,660
Even if you kill all Tushan's people,

386
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,220
you won't get the immortality medicine.

387
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:46,820
You!

388
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,140
Say that again!

389
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:48,820
No!

390
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,540
There's a cliff in the back mountain.

391
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,620
There's a cave in the back mountain.

392
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,380
Okay.

393
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,540
The immortality medicine must be in the cave.

394
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,340
You guys, go search.

395
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,220
Tushan Village's male and female prisoners are all dead.

396
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,020
Spare me!

397
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,900
I'll kill them!

398
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,580
I didn't expect

399
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,980
Ningbo Marquis to open a murder case.

400
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,900
I decided to go down the mountain secretly

401
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,300
before the soldiers found me.

402
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,060
But at that moment,

403
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,660
I heard a baby crying.

404
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,340
I wanted to throw away the baby

405
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,580
and run away alone.

406
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,340
But I don't know why

407
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,420
I couldn't let go of the baby.

408
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,340
So I had to hold it

409
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,420
and run away from Tushan Village.

410
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,140
And the baby still in the fortress

411
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,020
is you,

412
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,300
Sier.

413
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,580
At that time,

414
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,420
I saw you in my arms.

415
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,940
I thought maybe this is the baby.

416
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,180
I thought maybe this is the fate

417
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,820
that God gave me.

418
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,580
So I decided to adopt you.

419
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,860
We can be friends

420
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,820
even if we are daughters.

421
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,300
I also gave you my mother's name,

422
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,740
Sier.

423
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,980
I hoped

424
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,620
you could grow up safely.

425
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,860
But I didn't expect

426
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,260
a master

427
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,860
almost lost you.

428
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,420
Except for taking the medicine on time,

429
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,980
you could also build a golden lock

430
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,660
and live a long life.

431
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,300
If I had more skills,

432
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,860
I wouldn't have let Sier

433
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,260
lose a golden lock of Qi.

434
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,340
Take care, ladies.

435
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,300
Take my purse.

436
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,260
Catch him.

437
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,740
You're so bold.

438
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,940
How dare you take my purse?

439
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,060
I'm begging you.

440
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:09,860
I'm begging you.

441
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,180
I need the money

442
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,740
to save my daughter.

443
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,740
You're a lowly man.

444
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,660
Beat him.

445
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,620
Lady. Lady.

446
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:19,980
Beat him.

447
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,220
I'll beat him to death.

448
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,180
Stop.

449
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,340
Who are you?

450
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,620
Who are you?

451
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,220
My Lord.

452
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,420
Leave him to me.

453
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,140
Yes.

454
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,900
Li.

455
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,900
You're so lucky to find me.

456
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,700
Do you still remember

457
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,180
the thing you left in Tushan Village?

458
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,180
My Lord.

459
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,820
You're...

460
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,340
As long as you're loyal to me,

461
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,060
it's all yours.

462
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,740
I didn't expect

463
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,180
that you would find me

464
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,220
in the front line of Tushan Village

465
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,260
when I was in a hurry.

466
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,460
You even threatened me

467
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,860
as the descendant of Tushan.

468
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,980
You helped him

469
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,300
to open the underground business road

470
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,340
and collect information.

471
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,060
Besides,

472
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,740
I had to use this road

473
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,820
to transport military supplies and food.

474
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,660
That's a serious crime

475
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,060
that would kill a man.

476
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,260
But you were already

477
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,620
in a critical condition.

478
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,940
I promise you.

479
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:40,980
Okay.

480
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,180
From that day on,

481
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,860
I used this money

482
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,300
to open Qian Kun Lane

483
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,780
and trade with Ning Bo Hou secretly.

484
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,260
But I know that

485
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,380
Qian Kun Lane

486
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,500
will be a hidden danger sooner or later.

487
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,900
I didn't expect

488
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,740
it would come so soon.

489
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,140
Zi Yu used your life

490
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,900
and your identity as a threat

491
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,300
and asked me to avenge him.

492
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,740
I knew I had no other choice.

493
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,180
The only thing I could do

494
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,620
was to try to stop you

495
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,180
from getting hurt.

496
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,380
Now you know the source of the news.

497
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,340
I hope you won't blame me

498
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,300
for helping you.

499
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,660
How can I blame you?

500
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,180
All these years,

501
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,940
all kinds of

502
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,140
misdemeanors and complicated things

503
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,140
have been happening in Shang Shan.

504
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,740
All the sources

505
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,060
seem to be

506
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,220
the same as the one night of the Tushan Village.

507
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,500
Tushan Village?

508
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,020
Si Er,

509
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,980
you can go back to Tushan Village

510
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,340
and find out the truth behind all this.

511
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,820
You can also pretend that nothing happened

512
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,260
and live your life in hiding.

513
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,260
I wanted to help you before.

514
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,340
But from now on,

515
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,180
you can only decide

516
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,580
which path to take and which kind of person to be.

517
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,660
But no matter what choice you make,

518
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,780
I hope you will be happy.

519
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,540
Father.

520
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:22,180
I know what I should do.

521
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,820
Why are you sighing, Marquis?

522
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,380
Who is it?

523
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,700
So you're the one who saved me.

524
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,260
Why did you save me?

525
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,100
I saved you

526
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,580
to ask Marquis

527
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,460
if he still remembers someone.

528
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,700
Who is it?

529
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,820
Marquis,

530
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,140
do you remember the Kui Ba poem?

531
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,140
The Kui Ba poem?

532
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,940
What does it have to do with

533
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,540
your evil and dirty deeds?

534
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,860
Marquis, don't you think

535
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,340
that the words of the words are familiar?

536
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:36,980
You...

537
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,140
What do you mean?

538
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,420
Why are you so familiar

539
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,420
with the father and son?

540
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,500
Your First Son

541
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,860
is still very young.

542
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,300
You know the City of Ning Sang.

543
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,160
Isn't it functions to

544
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,260
go to the land of the Three Realms

545
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,660
the Ghost Goni?

546
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,540
You went on a long journey

547
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,460
after meeting Father.

548
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,460
But you've become

549
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,460
the father's plotter.

550
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,060
You're하

551
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,460
such a kid.

552
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,300
You are...

553
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,700
You are lying.

554
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,940
Marquis was too embarrassed

555
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,700
when he first saw the Void Sword.

556
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:20,100
Do you notice the birthmark on his left arm?

557
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,900
How could this be?

558
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,700
How could this be?

559
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,100
Who instigated you?

560
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,900
Why did you kill my son?

561
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,300
The Marquis is old.

562
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,900
His memory is bad.

563
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,300
The one who killed your son was me.

564
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:52,100
It was you who failed to make your son a drug.

565
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,500
But it's a pity that

566
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,300
the Marquis made the medicine for immortality

567
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,900
but it didn't fail.

568
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,900
Nonsense.

569
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,100
I made the medicine for the whole city.

570
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,700
It was fake.

571
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,500
There is no medicine for immortality in the world.

572
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,900
The medicine for immortality was made.

573
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,700
It's a pity that the Marquis was so greedy.

574
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,900
He couldn't make the medicine for immortality.

575
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,900
That's why he lost the wealth of the world.

576
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,300
He committed a crime in the mountains

577
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,700
and killed his own son.

578
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,700
Shut up.

579
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,300
The medicine for immortality is fake.

580
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,300
I'm just telling the truth.

581
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,300
I didn't...

582
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,100
I didn't kill my son.

583
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,500
Today is the birthday of the second son.

584
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,900
It's a pity that

585
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,300
the Marquis has been in the dungeon for a long time.

586
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,900
He may not know about the outside world.

587
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,100
He has escaped from the trouble.

588
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:57,300
But he killed his son to avenge you.

589
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,900
What a small child.

590
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,900
It's a pity.

591
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,700
Who sent you here?

592
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,300
Why did you do this?

593
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,700
The grudge between you and me

594
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,300
has come to an end.

595
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,100
Do you want to know who I am?

596
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,100
It's you.

597
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,300
I...

598
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,700
I'm going to die first.

599
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,300
The King of Ice has killed.

600
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,100
The star of the earth has risen.

601
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:20,100
I'm afraid the previous hang is already in operation.

602
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,300
That's great.

603
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,700
Finally, it's real.

604
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,300
But the Lord Gongsun just sent a letter

605
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,900
saying that the Ghost House is causing trouble.

606
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,100
The Ghost House?

607
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,700
The Ghost House?

608
00:34:41,500 --> 00:35:05,140
I've been looking for years to get the

609
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:33,100
Before theistling

610
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,140
to find medicine for the wise princes.

611
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,140
That's why they care about the motherland

612
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,140
and dare not take the medicine.

613
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,140
Your Majesty.

614
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,140
You are really thoughtful.

615
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,140
Don't worry.

616
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,140
I won't let anything happen to my son.

617
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,140
That's the only way.

618
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,140
I'm sorry.

619
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,140
Here is the report.

620
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,140
I heard that the Crown Prince Ying Zhu Zi

621
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,140
was ordered by the Emperor

622
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,140
to save the Eastern State from danger.

623
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,140
He drank the golden soup

624
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,140
and was crowned as the Emperor forever.

625
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,140
I also received the edict from the Holy Anxian

626
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,140
to restore my treasure.

627
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,140
The Emperor of the Immortal Medicine

628
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,140
has now ordered Zhu Zi

629
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,140
to be the ambassador of Shangshan.

630
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,140
He will take me to Dong Yi

631
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,140
to find medicine for me

632
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,140
to protect Shangshan and all the world.

633
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,140
Thank you for your kindness.

634
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,140
Thank you, Your Majesty.

635
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,140
Jiang Wenhuan.

636
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,140
On your way to the Eastern State,

637
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,140
His Majesty has appointed you as the Crown Prince Ying's vice-captain.

638
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,140
Go and receive the edict.

639
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

640
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,140
I will take the edict.

641
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,140
I have a way.

642
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,140
The one with the name on it

643
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,140
will go with you.

644
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,140
Master,

645
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,140
according to the edict,

646
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,140
the place where the Immortal Immortal is located

647
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,140
is it Dong Yi?

648
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,140
The edict doesn't say anything.

649
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,140
It's just that the material of the edict

650
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,140
is a special leather

651
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,140
made by Dong Yi, the State of Zhongli.

652
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,140
That is to say,

653
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,140
His Majesty sent you to Zhongli

654
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,140
with this clue.

655
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,140
Zhongli?

656
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,140
It was more than ten years ago

657
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,140
that I returned to my Shangshan.

658
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,140
All of this

659
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,140
is just a speculation.

660
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,140
Huan'er,

661
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,140
you must be very careful in going to Zhongli.

662
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,140
I understand.

663
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,140
I won't let you down.

664
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,140
The Immortal Immortal's medicine.

665
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,140
How could Zhongli have the Immortal Immortal's medicine?

666
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,140
The Immortal Immortal's medicine.

667
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,140
Dream comes true.

668
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,140
Thought comes true.

669
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,140
Who will ask about the past?

670
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,140
The stars in the world

671
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,140
are like the stars.

672
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,140
The white-haired man is like the white-haired man.

673
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:33,140
The youthful man is like the youthful man.

674
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:37,140
He is not ashamed of the world and his confidence.

675
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:41,140
He is very good at it.

676
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,140
Oh me.

677
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,600
I have heard of the

678
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,600
half-dead man

679
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,600
who is greedy for the old and the new.

680
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,600
He is not afraid of the world and the world.

681
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,600
He dares to take the empty city.

682
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,600
He is greedy for love and hatred.

683
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,600
He turns into a curse

684
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,600
and always leaves people behind.

685
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,600
He hopes that the mortal world

686
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,600
can be protected by a city.

687
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:48,360
Candied

688
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,140
The wind and the youthful man

689
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,260
reminds me of pendulum life.
