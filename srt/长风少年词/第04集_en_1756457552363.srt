00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,440
The selection of the candidate is for you to enter the card.

2
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,920
Episode 15

3
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,640
Thank you for your help today.

4
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,760
You helped me capture Ningbo and his son.

5
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,080
You really helped me a lot.

6
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,080
No.

7
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,720
You helped Dongwu a lot.

8
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,840
Didn't you call me a thief before?

9
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,800
I hope you can forgive me for all kinds of reasons.

10
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,080
Li Asi, wake up.

11
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,640
You have no bad thoughts about him.

12
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,760
Even if you have,

13
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,680
it's just to repay his life.

14
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,280
Yes.

15
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,560
That's it.

16
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,440
That's all.

17
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,200
It's all right.

18
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,120
Thank you for my help.

19
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,080
Li Asi,

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,040
τJu Zhu'er,

21
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,480
what good will it do for you to feel sad?

22
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,560
So,

23
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,960
how about looking at the seeds

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,680
that gigan habitually Bake?

25
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,920
That's what I am going to do.

26
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,480
You are finally back

27
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,120
Thank you

28
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,640
Give it back

29
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,880
She gave him

30
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,620
Finally a 보는

31
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,120
It should be that thief

32
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,440
Wait, Jiang Wenhuan, that idiot,

33
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,440
doesn't know how precious that pendant is, right?

34
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,440
It shouldn't be.

35
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,440
It doesn't look worth it.

36
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,440
We're finally here.

37
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,440
Tomorrow, the Crown Prince's camp will be opened.

38
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,440
These memorials will be handed over to His Majesty by the envoy.

39
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,440
I wonder if His Majesty will change his mind

40
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,440
when he sees these memorials.

41
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,440
He will give up on searching for the late medicine.

42
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
You're not being careful.

43
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,440
How could you change your mind so easily?

44
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,440
Today, the storm that started after you,

45
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,440
reminded me of the tragedy 16 years ago.

46
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,440
In that case,

47
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,440
Anna became like this

48
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,440
because of...

49
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,440
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,440
I really don't know

51
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,440
if the late medicine of the Great Wall

52
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,440
is the treasure of the nation or the source of the disaster.

53
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,440
In the past, His Majesty also established the Zhizi Camp

54
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,440
to look for the medicine for the country.

55
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,440
He made the Ningzhou of Fushu

56
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,440
become a prison in the mortal world.

57
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,440
Now,

58
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,440
His Majesty hasn't found the medicine to open again.

59
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,440
What is the purpose of this?

60
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,440
Your Majesty, please allow us to speculate.

61
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,440
But what I said is the truth.

62
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,440
Do you want me to pretend that nothing happened

63
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,440
to the tragedy 16 years ago?

64
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,440
Then you should understand

65
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,440
that I hate that tragedy more than you.

66
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
The same tragedy,

67
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,440
I certainly don't want it to happen again.

68
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
I don't want it to happen in the Eastern Wu's Mansion.

69
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,440
Wuyun,

70
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,440
I don't want it to happen in the Eastern Wu's Mansion.

71
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,440
Wuyun,

72
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,440
That's why I asked His Majesty

73
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,440
to arrange the Zhizi Camp in the Eastern Wu's Mansion.

74
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,440
The Zhizi Camp is the pre-ordained by His Majesty.

75
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
There is no return to the land.

76
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
But if it's in the Eastern Wu's Mansion,

77
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
there will be a chance.

78
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,440
You are in the Eastern Wu's Mansion.

79
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Only you are here,

80
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,440
Hua'er will be fine.

81
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,440
But now,

82
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,440
the situation is uncertain.

83
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,440
The land is in danger.

84
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,440
You need to be more cautious.

85
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,440
I just hope

86
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,440
that you don't have to marry alone.

87
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,440
I can...

88
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,440
Thank you for your kindness.

89
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
Shier and I have been together for so many years.

90
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,440
I can't let you go.

91
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,440
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
I'm used to it.

93
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,440
I just hope...

94
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,440
It's getting late.

95
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,440
You should go back.

96
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,440
I won't see you off.

97
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,440
Rest early.

98
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,440
The King of Cheng's will

99
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,440
in the Eastern Wu's Mansion

100
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,440
is ordered to open the Zhizi Camp.

101
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,440
I hope you can enter the camp.

102
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,440
The Heaven and Earth will be your slaves.

103
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
You will be cut off from its golden bones.

104
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,440
In the future,

105
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,440
you will be equipped with war armor,

106
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,440
and be forced to hunt horses.

107
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,440
I hope you can be of some help.

108
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,440
I order the Qing's Grand Master, Gongsun Wu Yu,

109
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,440
General Han Chi,

110
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,440
to send the imperial guards

111
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,440
to the capital.

112
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,440
I will wait for your order.

113
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,440
Gongsun Wu Yu,

114
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
General Han Chi,

115
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,440
Jiang Wen Feng,

116
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
will be the imperial guard.

117
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,440
We will supervise the Zhizi Camp together.

118
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,440
All the Zhizi must listen to the instructions in the camp.

119
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,440
They must not make any mistakes.

120
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,440
Why are there only you two?

121
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
Where are the others?

122
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
Beat them!

123
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,440
Beat them!

124
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,440
Beat them!

125
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,440
You are a loser!

126
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,440
I am a loser!

127
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,440
I am a loser!

128
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,440
Get up! Get up! Get up! I will do it.

129
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,440
If I win,

130
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,440
you can go back to the class with me.

131
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,440
Brother Jiang,

132
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,440
you are over-exaggerating.

133
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,440
I have never lost

134
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,440
the He Luo gambling board

135
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,440
in Xichuan.

136
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,440
He Luo gambling board?

137
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,440
The name is quite scary.

138
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,440
Are you afraid?

139
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,440
Let me tell you.

140
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,440
This He Luo gambling board

141
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,440
is made of ancient lotus soil.

142
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,440
If the dice is settled,

143
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,440
then we will be safe.

144
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
Stop talking.

145
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
You go first.

146
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,440
I will see you as a stone.

147
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,440
Look!

148
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,440
Beat them! Beat them!

149
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,440
11, 12, 13.

150
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,440
Come on, newbie.

151
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,440
Don't worry.

152
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
There are 14 and 15 left.

153
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
What are you afraid of?

154
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,440
For everyone's sake,

155
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
you don't need to go to class.

156
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,440
Let's go!

157
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,440
Beat them! Beat them!

158
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,440
11, 12, 13.

159
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,440
Come on.

160
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
Come on.

161
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,440
5, 3, 4.

162
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
There are 4 more.

163
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,440
Come on.

164
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,440
I will go first.

165
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,440
Come on.

166
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,440
I will go first.

167
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,440
Beat them! Beat them!

168
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,440
You little...

169
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
14.

170
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
14.

171
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,440
What?

172
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
Don't worry.

173
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
Don't worry.

174
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,440
I haven't turned yet.

175
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,440
I don't believe you can turn to 15.

176
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,440
Beat them! Beat them!

177
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
Taiding, blow it.

178
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,440
This one must be...

179
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,440
Beat them! Beat them!

180
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,440
16, 1.

181
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
I don't need to turn.

182
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,440
Enough.

183
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,440
Let's go back to class.

184
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,440
Let's go.

185
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
Let's go to class.

186
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,440
I am the hostage sent by the boss.

187
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,440
Why do you have to pretend to be a monster?

188
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,440
Fei Ye, Fei Ye.

189
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
Didn't you hear what Mr. Gong Song said?

190
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,440
This is the Lion's Camp, not the Chizil Camp.

191
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
Let's go to class.

192
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,440
Wait.

193
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
Brother Jiang,

194
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,440
do you know where my He Luo's gambling is?

195
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,440
How would I know your gambling?

196
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,440
It doesn't just need luck.

197
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,440
It also needs means.

198
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,440
You are the Crown Prince of Eastland.

199
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,440
Why do you have to help Qian?

200
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,440
Let me see.

201
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,440
You are not going to the dance studio.

202
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
What are you doing here?

203
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
Yes.

204
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,440
Isn't it the match between

205
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,440
Brother Wen Hua Xiu and Brother Xing Jiang?

206
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,440
Why are we being punished for this?

207
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,440
I am the one who is being punished.

208
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
I am the one who is being punished.

209
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440
Forget about the punishment.

210
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,440
He didn't go.

211
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,440
Why are we being punished?

212
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,440
Today's punishment

213
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
is the first lesson of your Lion's Camp.

214
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
I am just letting you know

215
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,440
that the Lion's Camp is a group.

216
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
One person is a great honor,

217
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,440
and the other is a great loss.

218
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,440
If one person makes a mistake,

219
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,440
he will be punished.

220
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,440
No one can be the only one to be punished.

221
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
Just like on the battlefield.

222
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,440
Do you understand?

223
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
Yes.

224
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,440
Louder.

225
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,440
Yes.

226
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,440
After you finish the horse,

227
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,440
go to General Chen.

228
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,440
Now there are five positions

229
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,440
in the camp.

230
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,440
They are the equipment manager,

231
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,440
the fire department manager,

232
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
the bedding manager,

233
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,440
the camp director

234
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440
and the horse manager.

235
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,440
The five positions need you to choose the positions.

236
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
Once you choose the positions,

237
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,440
you must do your best.

238
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,440
If you make a mistake,

239
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,440
the whole camp will be punished.

240
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
Brother Jiang,

241
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
this is your home.

242
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,440
You don't choose one?

243
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
I really can't.

244
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,440
I am not kidding.

245
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,440
When I was training with my brother

246
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,440
in the camp,

247
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,440
I did get the position.

248
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
I almost burned down Pan Chi's camp.

249
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,440
Then forget it.

250
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,440
Forget it.

251
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,440
So, for your safety,

252
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
everyone,

253
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
please choose the positions.

254
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
I will go first.

255
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,440
Brother Wang.

256
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
Brother Wang.

257
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
Good.

258
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,440
I am Wang Yuanji.

259
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,440
I will choose the fire department manager.

260
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,440
We have a lot of good food.

261
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,440
What kind of good food

262
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,440
is not in my stomach?

263
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,440
You don't look like it.

264
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,440
Not here.

265
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
But here.

266
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,440
I am Tao Yingzhong.

267
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,440
I have been training since I was young.

268
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
I am a hard worker.

269
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,440
I am not talented.

270
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,440
I want to be a chief.

271
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,440
I am Taidian.

272
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,440
I am a man.

273
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,440
My skills are not bad.

274
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,440
With me,

275
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,440
I can guarantee that

276
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,440
everyone will have new clothes to wear every day.

277
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,440
I will choose the fire department manager.

278
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,440
Brothers,

279
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,440
as long as I choose

280
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,440
the wine of the Crown Prince Camp today,

281
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
I will pay for it.

282
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,440
Good.

283
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,440
Wait.

284
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,440
No drinking in the army.

285
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,440
Yes.

286
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,440
Brothers,

287
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,440
you all understand.

288
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,440
Now,

289
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,440
there is only one left.

290
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,440
That is,

291
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,440
the horse manager who is in charge of the horses.

292
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
The horse manager must be

293
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
the brother of Chong from Libei.

294
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,440
He knows a lot about horses.

295
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,440
Well,

296
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,440
if no one chooses,

297
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,440
I will choose.

298
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
This guy wants to control the horses.

299
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,440
Can he do it?

300
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,440
My name is Yao Shuliang.

301
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,440
My motherland is not far from Donglu City.

302
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,440
But,

303
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,440
this is my first time

304
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,440
to travel far away from home.

305
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
I am a little timid.

306
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,440
But,

307
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,440
it's okay to deal with animals.

308
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,440
If everyone doesn't mind...

309
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,440
No problem.

310
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,440
The horse manager is here to save you.

311
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,440
Don't worry.

312
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,440
Really?

313
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,440
Really.

314
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,440
Good.

315
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,440
Good.

316
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,440
Good.

317
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,440
So far,

318
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,440
all five horses are in.

319
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,440
You can go back to the camp

320
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,440
to rest.

321
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,440
Thank you, General.

322
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,440
What should we do?

323
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,440
I hope you can get along well

324
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,440
with your colleagues and friends.

325
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,440
Colleagues and friends?

326
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,440
Didn't you say one person is one sword?

327
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,440
I don't care if I can't take the gambling cards.

328
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,440
I even asked my servants to leave.

329
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,440
I have to take the broken box myself.

330
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,440
I am also angry.

331
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,440
We are all dukes and princes.

332
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,440
And four people are in the camp.

333
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,440
Why?

334
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,440
How can we be polite?

335
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,440
Brother Xinjia,

336
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,440
you should be quiet.

337
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,440
If people hear this,

338
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,440
it will be bad.

339
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,440
What's wrong with that?

340
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,440
When I was in Xichuan,

341
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,440
I lived alone.

342
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
If they have any bad habits,

343
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,440
such as grinding teeth,

344
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,440
fighting, farting,

345
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,440
and having a sore throat,

346
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,440
what should I do?

347
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,440
Am I still alive?

348
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,440
Don't worry about this Mr. Xinjia.

349
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,440
Why?

350
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,440
The young masters who are in the camp

351
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,440
are all young masters of the Shi family.

352
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,440
Nothing will go wrong.

353
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,440
Forget it.

354
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,440
I don't have any hope.

355
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,440
No matter who I fight with,

356
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,440
as long as I don't meet

357
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,440
that bug-face who always

358
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
pulls the donkey's face,

359
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,440
and that bad guy who doesn't say a word,

360
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,440
that's enough.

361
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,440
Otherwise, I will be suffocated

362
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,440
before I reach the capital.

363
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
Mr. Xinjia, I am here.

364
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,440
Let's go.

365
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,440
God bless me.

366
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,440
God bless me.

367
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,440
I am the only one who is safe.

368
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,440
Don't let me

369
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
touch them.

370
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
Please, please.

371
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,440
You live here too?

372
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,440
Change it.

373
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,440
You want to

374
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,440
live with me?

375
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
I don't mean that.

376
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,440
Let's get off the street.

377
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
Aren't you afraid that I will kill you again?

378
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,440
You...

379
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,440
will you?

380
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,440
Excuse me.

381
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,440
This is also a sign.

382
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,440
This...

383
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,440
This is definitely not a disturbance.

384
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,440
Is there anyone?

385
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,440
Is there anyone?

386
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,440
Open the door.

387
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,440
This is the signboard room.

388
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,440
I didn't expect that

389
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,440
we are really

390
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,440
in the same room.

391
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,440
I am sorry.

392
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,440
I am sorry.

393
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,440
Same room?

394
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,440
Who is in the same room with you?

395
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,440
What a bad luck.

396
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,440
Brother He,

397
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,440
why does he always call you Xiaojie?

398
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,440
I am the same.

399
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
It's good that you don't mention it.

400
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,440
Alright.

401
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Let's just stay here.

402
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,440
Get in and eat.

403
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,440
Let's settle down.

404
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,440
With me here,

405
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
I can't just let you stay here.

406
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,440
Brother Jiang,

407
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,440
you live here too?

408
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,440
That's great.

409
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,440
We finally have

410
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,440
an interesting person

411
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,440
in our camp.

412
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,440
How about

413
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,440
we sleep in the middle?

414
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,440
That's the only way.

415
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,440
Brother Jiang.

416
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,440
Brother Jiang.

417
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,440
Brother Jiang.

418
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,440
The first man in the cave.

419
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,440
What?

420
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,440
You...

421
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,440
Did you hear anything?

422
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,440
What sound can there be in the middle of the night?

423
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,440
Sleep.

424
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,440
Did you hear that?

425
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,440
Then...

426
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,440
Open the door and take a look.

427
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,440
Why should I go?

428
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,440
This is your territory.

429
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,440
Even if it's some dirty stuff,

430
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,440
what if it's your old acquaintance?

431
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
What if that dirty stuff is a girl?

432
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,440
Girl?

433
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,440
Beauty.

434
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,440
Beauty.

435
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,440
What if it's a girl?

436
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,440
What if it's a girl?

437
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,440
What if it's a girl?

438
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,440
What if it's a girl?

439
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,440
What if it's a girl?

440
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,440
What if it's a girl?

441
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,440
What if it's a girl?

442
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,440
Beauty.

443
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,440
Beauty.

444
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,440
Go.

445
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,440
They didn't say it's a girl.

446
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,440
Go and take a look.

447
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,440
Go and take a look.

448
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,440
No wonder there's no girl.

449
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,440
Can you sleep now?

450
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,440
Sleep.

451
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,440
Sleep.

452
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,440
This...

453
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,440
Taoyun Bed.

454
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,440
What does it mean?

455
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,440
This might be the dream-like symptom in the book.

456
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,440
These symptoms only appear in sleep.

457
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,440
It will walk like a normal person.

458
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,440
But it's in the dream all the time.

459
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,440
It's not a dream.

460
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,440
It's a dream.

461
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,440
It's not a dream.

462
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,440
It's not a dream.

463
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,440
But it's in the dream all the time.

464
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,440
It doesn't matter if it's a dream or not.

465
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
Wait.

466
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,440
It's a dream.

467
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,440
It can't be awakened.

468
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,440
Now, the world is in control.

469
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,440
His Majesty is sitting on the throne.

470
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,440
800 lords of Zhenzhu are all over the mountain.

471
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,440
They are divided into four lords of Dazhu in the northeast, southwest and north.

472
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,440
They are called the living people of the four seas.

473
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,440
But they are all in defense.

474
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,440
We are soldiers of the mountain.

475
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,440
Brother Qi.

476
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,440
Wake up, Brother Qi.

477
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,440
Wake up, Brother Qi.

478
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,440
We are not wearing our guards.

479
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,440
We are in class.

480
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
Wake up.

481
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,440
Don't call me.

482
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,440
Brother Qi.

483
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,440
Brother Qi.

484
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,440
Brother Qi.

485
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,440
Wake up.

486
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,440
Brother Qi.

487
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
Brother Qi.

488
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,440
Brother Qi.

489
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,440
Wake up.

490
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,440
Brother Qi.

491
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,440
On the edge of my bombshell,

492
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,440
is there something going on within the palace?

493
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,440
What's going on?

494
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,440
General.

495
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,440
Don't you know what I have endured last night

496
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,440
just by looking at you.

497
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,440
You ?

498
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,760
Sorry.

499
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,160
You're just like the other three.

500
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,760
Look at them.

501
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,160
They're sitting straight. They have a good attitude.

502
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,160
Tai Dian.

503
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,280
Tai Dian!

504
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,560
I...I didn't sleep.

505
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,440
Not bad.

506
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,960
Continue with your class.

507
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,400
Brother Tao.

508
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
Today...

509
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400
Help me give this to Brother Jiang.

510
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
You came to my Donglu for training.

511
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,000
In the future,

512
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
you must become my elite soldiers and soldiers.

513
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,600
The security of the city will also be on your shoulders.

514
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Brother Jiang,

515
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
you must be careful not to let me give this to you.

516
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,800
You must be careful not to let me give this to you.

517
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,800
Okay.

518
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,600
Yesterday's class, we talked about the layout of the city.

519
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,760
I'll give you a few questions.

520
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,760
You can answer them.

521
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,760
What?

522
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,760
This horse is lost.

523
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,760
Jiang Wenhuan!

524
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,760
This morning,

525
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,760
I planned to go to class for the horse.

526
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,760
But I didn't think

527
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,920
that the Golden Jade War Horse was missing.

528
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,920
I was thinking

529
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,920
that the Golden Jade War Horse that His Majesty gave me

530
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,920
might have been stolen by the thief.

531
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,920
The Golden Jade War Horse was stolen.

532
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,920
It's a big deal.

533
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,920
Did you really search everywhere?

534
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,920
I really searched.

535
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,920
Otherwise, I wouldn't have arrived at the class so late.

536
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,920
These horses are not ordinary war horses.

537
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,920
Each one is a good horse from the capital.

538
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,920
It's a gift from His Majesty.

539
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,080
I'm afraid that our whole camp will be in trouble.

540
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,080
Then...

541
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,080
What should we do?

542
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,080
It's all my fault.

543
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,080
It's me, the head of the horse,

544
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,080
that has caused everyone to be in trouble.

545
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,080
The Crown Prince's camp is always in trouble.

546
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,080
Although you're the head of the horse,

547
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,080
it's not your fault that the horse is lost.

548
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,080
Today, the two supervisors will be sent away by the letter from the mountain.

549
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,080
They won't be able to return before nightfall.

550
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,240
We should have searched the horse before we arrived.

551
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,240
Really?

552
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,240
The Golden Jade War Horse is the leader.

553
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,240
It's not an ordinary thief

554
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,240
to have stolen it without any reason.

555
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,240
It's hard to find a common trick.

556
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,240
But there's one place

557
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,240
that must be useful.

558
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,240
What is it?

559
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,240
The first ghost in the Eastland is

560
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,240
the Prime Minister of the Qian Kun.

561
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,240
What's up?

562
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,240
The Prime Minister of Qian Kun is the first ghost in the Eastland.

563
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,240
It's said to be a man who can take on the world's hard-to-fail,

564
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,240
and is difficult to be found in the world.

565
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,240
Whatever you want,

566
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,640
to make the Qian Kun statue.

567
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,760
The first one to build the Qian Kun statue

568
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,840
is Dongwu Ju Gu, Li Lang.

569
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,560
His background is mysterious.

570
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,760
But he has been riding a horse alone for ten years.

571
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,520
He has a big body.

572
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,960
As a kid,

573
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,600
he knows all the tricks.

574
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,720
This is the Qian Kun statue?

575
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,160
It's really good.

576
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,520
It's good to go out without permission.

577
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:07,880
Well...

578
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,800
I'll tell Yao Shuling

579
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,840
to send me the message.

580
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,400
When did you tell Yao Shuling to do that?

581
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,080
Why don't I know?

582
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,560
If something happens,

583
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,240
is there a countermeasure?

584
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,440
The waterways in the back

585
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,400
are too steep.

586
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,840
When did you two

587
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,120
get on so well?

588
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,600
Wait for me.

589
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,400
I didn't expect Dongwu Ju

590
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,120
to have such a poor and barren place.

591
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,120
This is the place

592
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,360
where the song was sung.

593
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,200
What? Where?

594
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,800
The place where the song was sung.

595
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,840
You've been here too?

596
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,200
The name Qian Kun statue

597
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,760
is familiar even though I've lived in the capital for a long time.

598
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,040
I've never heard of it.

599
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,160
That's right.

600
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,080
In the Eastland,

601
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,800
the bandits will transport

602
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,560
valuable items here.

603
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,320
The price will be higher

604
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,880
if the song is sung.

605
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,760
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

606
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,360
Wait.

607
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,560
The five streets

608
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,280
where the song was sung are unknown.

609
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,120
It's always dark here.

610
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,480
It's not a familiar place.

611
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:16,880
You can't enter.

612
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,400
I can't go in for a long time.

613
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,480
Then,

614
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,320
let's go back.

615
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,200
I have another idea.

616
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,520
What? What idea?

617
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,040
Xingjiao.

618
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,840
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

619
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,520
Let's go. Let's go.

620
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,960
You said that a man can go and be in deep.

621
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,680
Why

622
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,320
do you think I can go alone?

623
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,480
You two are still in deep.

624
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,320
There is always a dance performance

625
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,400
in the factory.

626
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,840
It's easy to be

627
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,200
confused when it's done with a dance.

628
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,800
As for me,

629
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,560
I'll be the buyer

630
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,960
and work with you.

631
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,080
You...

632
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,080
Where did you get it?

633
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:03,920
I borrowed it.

634
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,680
You borrowed it?

635
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,160
You stole it.

636
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,360
You borrowed it?

637
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,280
What about him?

638
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,200
You stole it for him too?

639
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,040
No.

640
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,200
Then how did he get in?

641
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:26,640
Let's go.

642
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,640
Okay.

643
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,600
One has his own way.

644
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,320
One is wide enough.

645
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,000
What about me?

646
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,400
I'm beautiful.

647
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,000
Stop.

648
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,160
You.

649
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,080
Go in.

650
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,360
You two

651
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,160
are not regular customers of Xu Kongge.

652
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,640
I'm busy.

653
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,480
It's normal that you don't remember me.

654
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,240
I think the waist plate in your hand

655
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,600
is not yours.

656
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,680
Let me see.

657
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,280
I'm sorry.

658
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,360
I'm not familiar with Taishan.

659
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,040
I didn't know you two

660
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,560
are the guests of the First Miss.

661
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,760
I'm sorry.

662
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,000
Please come in.

663
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,080
Who?

664
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,920
Please come in.

665
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,040
Thank you.

666
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,840
Thank you for coming.

667
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,280
I'm a potsetsعل in Xu Kongge.

668
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,120
Next,

669
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,560
I want to sing

670
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,760
Today's lady of the warm household training time

671
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,800
The real Doc on the boat

672
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,280
Okay.

673
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,840
Look at this woman in the Golden Jade.

674
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,840
She is indeed different from the normal women.

675
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,840
She is much taller than the women of our Eastern Courtyard.

676
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
This is not a thief.

677
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,840
We must find the real seller.

678
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,840
How much did you bring?

679
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,840
How much do you want?

680
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,840
How is it, everyone?

681
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,840
This treasure is extraordinary.

682
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,840
Today, we will follow the old rules.

683
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,840
When I knock on the bell,

684
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,840
the time to start the auction

685
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,840
is the time to start the auction.

686
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,840
The starting price is 100.

687
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,840
110?

688
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,840
110.

689
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,840
150.

690
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,840
150.

691
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,840
200.

692
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,840
300.

693
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,840
400.

694
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,840
400.

695
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,840
500.

696
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,840
500.

697
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,840
This customer is so generous.

698
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,840
Good.

699
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,840
500 coins for one time.

700
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,840
500 coins for two times.

701
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,840
500.

702
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,840
1000.

703
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,840
This gentleman is so generous.

704
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,840
He is so generous at such a young age.

705
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,840
I don't know which noble man's salary is this.

706
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,840
1000.

707
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,840
1000.

708
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,840
1000 coins, everyone.

709
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,840
1500.

710
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,840
I will get it.

711
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,840
1500 coins.

712
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,840
1501.

713
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,840
1501.

714
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,840
2000.

715
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,840
2000 coins.

716
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,840
2001.

717
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,840
2500.

718
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,840
Plus one.

719
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,840
3000.

720
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,840
Plus one.

721
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,840
3500.

722
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,840
Plus one.

723
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,840
4000.

724
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,840
Plus one.

725
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,840
You always add one coin at a time.

726
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,840
You are really...

727
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,840
5000.

728
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,840
5000.

729
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,840
Everyone, listen carefully.

730
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,840
This gentleman has already paid 5000 coins.

731
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,840
How about it?

732
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,840
Can there be a higher price than 5000?

733
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,840
It's time.

734
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,840
Do it.

735
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,840
In this case,

736
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,840
5000 coins for one time.

737
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,840
5000 coins for two times.

738
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,840
Good.

739
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,840
5000 coins.

740
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,840
Wait a minute.

741
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,840
5000 coins is not a small number.

742
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,840
If you can really find a pure gold-plated horse, it's not bad.

743
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,840
But what if you can't?

744
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,840
This...

745
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,840
This gentleman is really joking.

746
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,840
If you know that you can get on my stage,

747
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,840
that is a real product.

748
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,840
How can there be a fake product?

749
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,840
You are thinking too much.

750
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,840
But this pure gold-plated horse,

751
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,840
no one has ever seen it.

752
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,840
How can I check it?

753
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,840
I can't say that

754
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,840
this is a pure gold-plated horse.

755
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,840
The pure gold-plated horse is real.

756
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,840
I tell you.

757
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,840
I, Xu Kongge, have been in the Qian Kun Lane for many years.

758
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,840
I rely on this genuine product.

759
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,840
I promise to pay 1000 gold coins.

760
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,840
Of course, there will be no fake.

761
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,840
Besides, in our place,

762
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,840
there is never a pure gold-plated horse.

763
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,840
Before the trade of the gold medal is successful,

764
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,840
we should check the value of the goods first.

765
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,840
As you know,

766
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,840
the pure gold-plated horse is rare.

767
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,840
But the ones from my Eastland are all the tribute of the capital.

768
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,840
Why don't you take this horse out and see

769
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,840
where it comes from?

770
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,840
So that everyone can be at ease.

771
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,840
After all,

772
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,840
5000 coins.

773
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,840
No rush.

774
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,840
This is not a small amount.

775
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,840
Sir.

776
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,840
That's right.

777
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,840
Since I spend a lot of money to buy a horse,

778
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,840
I should check the horse first.

779
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,840
Ask the horse seller to move the horse out

780
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,840
and show it to everyone.

781
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,840
Yes, show it to everyone.

782
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,840
Yes, show it to everyone.

783
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,840
Listen to me.

784
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,840
This is really hard for me.

785
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,840
We have rules here.

786
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,840
This is not...

787
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,840
Everyone.

788
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,840
Please.

789
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,840
Please.

790
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,840
Please.

791
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,840
Please.

792
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,840
Please.

793
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,840
Take it out.

794
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,840
Please.

795
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,840
Please.

796
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,840
Please.

797
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,840
Please.

798
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,840
Please.

799
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,840
Everyone, don't worry.

800
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,840
I swear on the blood of my tribe.

801
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,840
This horse

802
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,840
is a pure gold-plated horse.

803
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,840
As for where it comes from

804
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,240
there is no place for you to show your face.

805
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,520
Please forgive us.

806
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,920
Xu Kong Ge does have his rules.

807
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,440
But our money isn't from Da Feng.

808
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,920
That's right.

809
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,680
The horse is real or fake.

810
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,520
We'll know when we see it.

811
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,360
This young man has been making trouble.

812
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,560
Is there any other reason?

813
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,160
I'm just helping out with the horse.

814
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,760
I'll tell the owner of the horse in private.

815
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,040
It has nothing to do with you.

816
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,960
Who knows that you'll turn your back on me

817
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,360
and run away with the money?

818
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,240
If you're capable, show your horse.

819
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,440
So everyone can judge.

820
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,440
Yes, show it.

821
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,240
Who are you?

822
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,520
Who are you?

823
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,400
Why are you so

824
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,320
unruly?

825
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,520
I'm here to get you.

826
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,920
Someone, help!

827
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,120
Someone, help!

828
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,720
Speak.

829
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,720
Where's the horse?

830
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,640
Speak.

831
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,520
Who dares to make trouble in Xu Kong Ge?

832
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,520
Release them!

833
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,920
Release them!

834
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,200
These people are making trouble. Catch them!

835
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,600
Who are you?

836
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,800
How dare you make trouble in Xu Kong Ge?

837
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,520
What are you talking about?

838
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,200
Catch them first!

839
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,320
Catch them all!

840
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,000
Stop!

841
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,720
Miss.

842
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,800
Miss?

843
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,520
The dream has come true. The year has come true.

844
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,120
Who has heard of the past?

845
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,720
The stars in the world are like the stars.

846
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,720
The white swan is like the star.

847
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,320
The youthful encounter is like the shadow of the moon.

848
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,920
There's no regret for the world's great love.

849
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,520
The hatred is deep and deep.

850
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:39,520
My face is deeply drenched in sweat.

851
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,080
Who dares to make trouble in Xu Kong Ge?

852
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:46,120
The horse may be thrown away but the conductive treatment is avenged by war.

853
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,160
Who dares to be silent

854
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,920
about the dull gender rich scrappers and inhale wild crows?

855
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:59,840
Who dares to let treasure were Policyriage in the full addWoman momentarily
