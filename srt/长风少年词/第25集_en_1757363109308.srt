1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,440
We will be together forever

2
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,040
We will never stop loving each other

3
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,560
We will never give up

4
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,040
We will never stop

5
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,320
until we are old and dead

6
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,880
We will never stop

7
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,920
until we are old and dead

8
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,560
Why did you do this to me?

9
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,800
I'm afraid

10
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,440
it's not because I'm a good person

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,360
I'm afraid it's because I'm a good person

12
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,960
I want to know what you think

13
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,400
I'm afraid it's because I'm a good person

14
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,800
I'm afraid it's because I'm a good person

15
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
You mentioned his name

16
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,520
It seems that he saw your real face

17
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,760
Revenge

18
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,720
Shut up

19
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,200
Revenge

20
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,720
Shut up

21
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,840
A cruel and cold person like you

22
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,640
who has no feelings

23
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,960
How could the real person

24
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,880
stay with you willingly?

25
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,280
Shut up

26
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,880
I want you to shut up

27
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,720
Prince Jiang

28
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,520
I want to know what you think

29
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,640
You think you won't be saved

30
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,080
if you die?

31
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,640
Dream

32
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,320
This sword

33
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,200
won't let you die

34
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,400
It will make you

35
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,320
die

36
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,480
Let's go

37
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,840
Uncle Lian

38
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,600
Run

39
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,800
Leave other important

40
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,480
equestrian heroes

41
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,080
Run

42
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,800
Bring the destroyer down

43
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,720
First, we surely diplomat.

44
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:41,880
afore

45
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,720
I believe you.

46
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,280
Although fate is not something that can be done,

47
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,040
we must know what is right and what is wrong.

48
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,880
We must be able to distinguish right from wrong.

49
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,360
Also,

50
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,680
we must know what is right and what is wrong.

51
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,720
We must have the courage to do so.

52
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,280
The

53
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,240
Come quickly!

54
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,880
It's really too bad.

55
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:37,200
Oh, my! These people have disappeared

56
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,920
the

57
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,920
The

58
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,280
There

59
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,800
really

60
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:58,660
were

61
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,660
Come on.

62
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,660
One more pot.

63
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,660
You can drink like this?

64
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,660
I've been here for days.

65
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,660
I'm so drunk every day.

66
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,660
Who cares?

67
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,660
My wine.

68
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,660
Are you crazy?

69
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,660
I'm not crazy.

70
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,660
I'm crazy.

71
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,660
Kill me.

72
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,660
Kill me.

73
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,660
Go.

74
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,660
You're crazy.

75
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,660
You're useless.

76
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,660
Why are you so unwell?

77
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,660
Take him back.

78
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,660
He needs to live for a while.

79
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,660
Go.

80
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,660
Run.

81
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,660
You're here for yourself.

82
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,660
What's the use?

83
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,660
When you save Jiang Wenhuan,

84
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,660
you'll die.

85
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,660
Stop.

86
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,660
I can't do this.

87
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,660
Even if my family is useless,

88
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,660
I should take my brother back before I die.

89
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,660
I want to save Jiang.

90
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,660
I have to save Jiang.

91
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,660
Zhongli Palace is heavily guarded.

92
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,660
How can we save Jiang?

93
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,660
Brother Chong, you're finally back.

94
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,660
Where's Brother Xinjia?

95
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,660
He's gone.

96
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,660
It's no use coming back.

97
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,660
Who's there?

98
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,660
Why are you here?

99
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,660
You must cooperate with me

100
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,660
to save Jiang Wenhuan.

101
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,660
Why should we trust you?

102
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,660
Because of this.

103
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,660
Wen Tian.

104
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,660
Gu Xi.

105
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,660
You're finally married to me.

106
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,660
But why do you have to do this now?

107
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,660
If so,

108
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,660
I'll do as you say.

109
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,660
Open the door.

110
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,660
Yes.

111
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,660
You're here so soon.

112
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,660
Tomorrow is the wedding day

113
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,660
of the King and Gu Xi.

114
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,660
We'll celebrate the country's independence

115
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,660
and seek a bride.

116
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,660
You're lucky.

117
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,660
You're lucky.

118
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,660
I'm not.

119
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,660
I'm not.

120
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,660
I'm not.

121
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,660
I'm not.

122
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,660
I'm not.

123
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,660
I'm not.

124
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,660
I'm not.

125
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,660
I'm not.

126
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,660
I'm not.

127
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,660
What did you say?

128
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,660
Stop talking.

129
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,660
Eat. I'll eat.

130
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,660
Don't act rashly

131
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,660
at the wedding tomorrow.

132
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,660
Everything

133
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,660
is under my control.

134
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,660
What are you going to do?

135
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,660
I have my own way

136
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,660
to deal with Zhong Linyuan.

137
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,660
What do you want to say?

138
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,660
Brother Jiang mentioned

139
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,660
that the real man

140
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,660
is a man of life.

141
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,660
I don't want to believe it anymore.

142
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,660
What?

143
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,660
You want to count it?

144
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,660
It doesn't matter.

145
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,660
Is Eishun

146
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,660
your real name?

147
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,660
What do you think?

148
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,660
I was born in Yanggu

149
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,660
and was born in Xianchi.

150
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,660
I've been to all places

151
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,660
and I'm a decent person.

152
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,660
I was born

153
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,660
in Xiangyang.

154
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,660
The patient

155
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,660
is Guangming.

156
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,660
Brother Jiang is a man of life.

157
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,660
He has been

158
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,660
in every crisis.

159
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,660
Brother Jiang will stand up

160
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,660
and turn into a man of life.

161
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,660
Brother Jiang never

162
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,660
gives up

163
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,660
and goes through every crisis.

164
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,660
No matter where he is,

165
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,660
Brother Jiang will not give up easily.

166
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,660
He will not give up on himself

167
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,660
or anyone.

168
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,660
When he's with Brother Jiang for a long time,

169
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,660
he will think

170
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,660
if he can be

171
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,660
as good as him,

172
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,660
he will be fearless

173
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,660
and be fearless.

174
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,660
The physical and the physical are moving

175
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,660
and the physical and the physical are moving.

176
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,660
Everything is moving.

177
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,660
People are also

178
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,660
interacting with each other.

179
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,660
Do you know

180
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,660
that there is a star

181
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,660
in the seven stars of Beidou

182
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,660
called Yaoguang?

183
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,660
Yaoguang?

184
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,660
Yaoguang is the most eastern star

185
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,660
in the seven stars of Beidou.

186
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,660
It's also called the Star of Breaking the Army.

187
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,660
The Star of Breaking the Army

188
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,660
is not concerned with its own safety

189
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,660
and is alone in the enemy's hands.

190
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,660
It's a sign of a strong will to break the enemy's back.

191
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,660
You know that the enemy is the only one who can survive.

192
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,660
I thought

193
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,660
I had already broken my fate.

194
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,660
But now I realize

195
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,660
that I'm escaping from another kind of fate.

196
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,660
And this kind of possibility

197
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,660
may really be different.

198
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,660
Something's wrong.

199
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,660
What is this?

200
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,660
This is the safety rope.

201
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,660
I hope that the brothers will come back safely tomorrow.

202
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,660
Don't worry.

203
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,660
I will definitely save Jiang Wanwan back.

204
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,660
After we set out tomorrow,

205
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,660
you can go to the city to meet with Taotie Army.

206
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,660
I will wait for you.

207
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,660
I'm going to the city to meet with Taotie Army.

208
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,660
I'm going to meet with Taotie Army.

209
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,660
I'm going to meet with Taotie Army.

210
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,660
I thought I had already broken my fate.

211
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,660
But now I realize

212
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,660
that I'm escaping from another kind of fate.

213
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,820
I don't believe in heaven or hell

214
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,860
I only believe in myself

215
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:01,660
Go

216
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:04,980
Hurry up

217
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,500
Go

218
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,700
Lord Dong Hua

219
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,980
You are here, Lord Jiang

220
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,460
I invite a criminal to your wedding

221
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,020
I'm afraid that you will get bane

222
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,020
There are obstacles in good construction

223
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,060
Today's wedding is extraordinary

224
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,300
Lord Jiang, we should celebrate it together

225
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,300
The auspicious time has come.

226
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,700
He's here.

227
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,100
Open the door!

228
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,300
I'm not here to be king.

229
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,100
I'm here to fulfill my promise to someone.

230
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,300
The auspicious time has come.

231
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,300
Only then can I match this beautiful dress.

232
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,300
Open the door!

233
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:27,300
Gu Xie, what are you trying to do?

234
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,300
Take him away!

235
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,300
The grand ceremony begins!

236
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,300
Welcome, King of Zhongli!

237
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,300
Umm...

238
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,300
Send Almighty King over!

239
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,360
Let's drink the good wine!

240
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,100
Right.

241
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,060
Why don't you drink?

242
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,700
Are you afraid that I'll poison you?

243
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,900
Before the ceremony starts,

244
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,980
I want to say something to Jiang Wenhuan.

245
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,500
You really think I don't know

246
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,980
that the wedding banquet today

247
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,300
was a trap set by you to save Jiang Wenhuan?

248
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,380
Those scholars outside

249
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,060
were used to surprise me.

250
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,780
Guards, surround them.

251
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,780
Guards, surround them.

252
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,180
Guards, surround them.

253
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,380
Go ahead.

254
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,980
But

255
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,780
it's better not to act rashly.

256
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,380
Jiang Wenhuan,

257
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,380
didn't you say that you never believed in fate?

258
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,580
Then I'll show you

259
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,380
what fate is.

260
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,980
The picture you see now

261
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,780
is the path of fate.

262
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,380
In the future, one day,

263
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,380
you'll be able to see

264
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,580
the Great Wall

265
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,580
that Zhongli has been going through for a long time.

266
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,580
And the people

267
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,180
will be trapped in the water.

268
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,980
How could this be?

269
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,980
But you said

270
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,180
you didn't believe in fate.

271
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,580
You wanted to change your fate.

272
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,580
So Jiang Wenhuan,

273
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,180
I want you to promise me

274
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,980
that no matter what happens in the future,

275
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,780
you'll protect Zhongli for me.

276
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,780
I promise you.

277
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,180
What about you?

278
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,780
From now on,

279
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,580
I'll take care of Zhongli.

280
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,180
I'll take care of Zhongli people.

281
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,580
Today,

282
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,980
I'll be your wife.

283
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,180
You'll be my wife.

284
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,980
I'll be your wife.

285
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,180
I'll be your wife.

286
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,180
I'll be your wife.

287
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,380
Together,

288
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,180
we'll change the fate of the world.

289
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,180
What are you doing?

290
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,180
Don't do anything stupid.

291
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:45,180
Yuan.

292
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,180
No!

293
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,180
No!

294
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,180
No!

295
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,180
Kill them!

296
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,180
Kill them!

297
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,180
No!

298
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,180
It's a heart armor!

299
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,180
I knew it.

300
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,180
This guy won't be so careless.

301
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,180
No one can...

302
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,180
hurt my brother again!

303
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,180
Yiguan!

304
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,180
Call for Yiguan!

305
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,180
What did I do wrong?

306
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,180
Why did you leave me?

307
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,180
Why?

308
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,180
Gu Xi.

309
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,180
I'm not Gu Xi.

310
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,180
You promised me

311
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,180
that you would return my life

312
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,180
after Xianxuan's death.

313
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,180
Do you still remember

314
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,180
what I called you?

315
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,180
Gu Xi.

316
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,180
Gu Xi.

317
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,180
You forgot.

318
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,180
You forgot everything.

319
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,180
Help!

320
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,180
Yaoguang,

321
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,180
from today on,

322
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,180
you will be changed to Gu Xi.

323
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,180
You and I will live and die together

324
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,180
and fight together.

325
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,180
I'm Yaoguang.

326
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,180
I'm lost in the night.

327
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,180
I'm surprised.

328
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,180
I'm going to die.

329
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,180
But

330
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,180
how can I do it?

331
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,180
I...

332
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,180
Gu Xi.

333
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,180
Back then,

334
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,180
I killed 70 people

335
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,180
because of you.

336
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,180
But I believed you.

337
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,180
I believed that you could change everything

338
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,180
and save Zhongli.

339
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,180
All these years,

340
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,180
I never doubted

341
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,180
what the relationship between us was.

342
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,180
You slowly forgot Zhongli,

343
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,180
people

344
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,180
and our promise.

345
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,180
I let go of my promise

346
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,180
and my ambition and desire

347
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,180
to eat you up.

348
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,180
If we really

349
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,180
never met,

350
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,180
I would cry.

351
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,180
Yaoguang.

352
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,180
I beg you.

353
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,180
Don't leave me.

354
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,180
I'm afraid.

355
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,180
I'm afraid.

356
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,180
You are the only person

357
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,180
who cares about and trusts me.

358
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,180
You should know that

359
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,180
no matter what happens,

360
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,180
I will never harm you.

361
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,180
Are you okay?

362
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,180
I'm fine.

363
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,180
You are dead.

364
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,180
Can you come back

365
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,180
to me?

366
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:03,180
I hope the ice melts.

367
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,180
Night rain falls,

368
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,180
the heart is saying,

369
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,180
I don't want you and me.

370
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,180
The candlelight is lit,

371
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,180
the smile is bright.

372
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:23,180
There is no silence in the dream.

373
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:27,180
A heart is light,

374
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,180
the beauty is far away.

375
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,180
Don't worry.

376
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,180
I will be with you

377
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,180
on the road.

378
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,180
The yearning is long,

379
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,180
the dream is long.

380
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,180
We are separated.

381
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,180
The love is like a cloud.

382
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:47,180
I can't see you clearly.

383
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,180
I look back at you.

384
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:54,180
The love is like a cloud.

385
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,180
From now on,

386
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,180
I will take care of Zhong Linyuan.

387
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,180
I will take care of Zhongli people.

388
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,180
Gu Xie.

389
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,180
The rain is saying,

390
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:19,180
the hand is like you in the dream.

391
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,180
How can I go back?

392
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:27,180
There is a future for love.

393
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:30,180
How can I go back?

394
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:38,180
There is a future for love.

395
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,180
Are you awake?

396
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,180
Do you feel better?

397
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,180
Much better.

398
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,180
Zhongli is cold.

399
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,180
You just came out of the prison.

400
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,180
I will make a medicine for you and Anash.

401
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,180
In case you catch a cold.

402
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,180
You are thoughtful.

403
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,180
By the way,

404
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,180
your second brother's hand is poisoned.

405
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,180
Do you have a way to get rid of it?

406
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,180
I have a direction.

407
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,180
I will use the blood of Ba to make a medicine.

408
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,180
You want to poison with poison?

409
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:43,180
Poisoning with poison is a little risky.

410
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,180
I will go to see your brother.

411
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,180
Then I will help Anash to make a medicine.

412
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,180
Go.

413
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,180
What is this?

414
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,180
Isn't this wound the poison of Ba?

415
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,180
Is it that time?

416
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:32,180
My clothes were stained with blood crystal powder when I was making the medicine.

417
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,180
But Anash,

418
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,180
how could it be?

419
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,180
Could it be?

420
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,180
I will go to see your brother.

421
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,180
I will go to see him.

422
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,180

448
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,180
