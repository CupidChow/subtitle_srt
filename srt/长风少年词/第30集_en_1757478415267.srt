Swords of Legends II

00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,500
Episode 26

3
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,340
Leave An translation to me!

4
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,420
You'll destroy my flesh and blood!

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,920
wanted to subdue us.

6
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,160
But

7
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,120
he's mine.

8
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,680
It doesn't matter

9
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,000
who your choose.

10
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,480
Let's face him tear him up.

11
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:41,800
Come on!

12
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,760
Burst Me In The White Flame!

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,680
Vitäºº?

14
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,160
piggy!

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,800
I will definitely save Jiang Wanhuan back.

16
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,800
I...

17
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
will wait...

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,800
for you.

19
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,000
De...

20
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,200
I promise you.

21
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,800
I will wait for you.

22
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,800
I...

23
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,200
I will...

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,800
wait...

25
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,400
for you.

26
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The palace is in chaos!

27
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,780
His Majesty's shadow

28
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,000
is all over the place!

29
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,800
Why don't you just surrender?

30
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,200
Master,

31
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,200
you failed to control the evil.

32
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,000
Huan'er,

33
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,600
didn't I teach you?

34
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,400
You never know

35
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,000
what will happen at the last moment.

36
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't you find it strange?

37
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,600
You asked Donglu for help.

38
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,600
Why didn't your big brother's shadow

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,400
show up?

40
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,600
Follow me.

41
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,000
Follow me.

42
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,200
You will see your big brother.

43
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,600
Let her go.

44
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,200
Brother Qiang.

45
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,600
Let her go!

46
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,200
Why are you alone?

47
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
Where is An'an?

48
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,200
She will never come back.

49
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,200
She is still young.

50
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,400
Poor child.

51
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,400
My child is not coming back!

52
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,800
My An'an is gone.

53
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,800
My child is gone!

54
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,600
My child is gone!

55
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,800
My child is gone!

56
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,000
My child is gone!

57
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,600
My child is gone!

58
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,200
My child is gone!

59
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,200
My An'an

60
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,800
was chosen by the Nine-tailed Fox.

61
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,200
Her flesh and blood

62
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,200
can revive the dead.

63
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Her power

64
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,000
can rule over thousands of monsters.

65
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,200
Do you know what her name means?

66
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
An'an

67
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,800
is the king of the ten realms in the Ghost Faction.

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,600
My child is the king.

69
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,800
She is the only light

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,400
in this chaotic world.

71
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,400
Ghost Faction?

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,800
Your husband taught you, right?

73
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,000
Do you know that

74
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,400
the real meaning of An'an

75
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
is the first warrior of the heaven and earth?

76
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,800
This is the expectation of your husband for your child.

77
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,800
Under the Nine-tailed Fox,

78
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
is she really willing to see

79
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
your mother and son become so low?

80
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,200
Are you qualified to mention her?

81
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,400
She died under the care of Master Yuan Yang.

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,400
She was killed by you.

83
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,600
What about me?

84
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,800
Am I not qualified?

85
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,000
I've thought about it.

86
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,600
If An'an is cured,

87
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,800
you can teach her to play the qin and play the zither.

88
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,800
I'll teach her to ride a horse and shoot arrows.

89
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,600
Let her be a top-notch

90
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,400
and upright man

91
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,400
and talk to bad boys.

92
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,000
It's all her fault!

93
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,000
If she hadn't brought the people of the Eagle Division

94
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
to fight against me,

95
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
I wouldn't have lost.

96
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,200
My An'an would never die!

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Huan'er.

98
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,600
What's wrong with you?

99
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,400
What's wrong with you?

100
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,400
I really want to see

101
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,600
how you will show up

102
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,200
when she sees you now.

103
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,400
You asked me to make a wish.

104
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,200
I did it immediately.

105
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,600
You asked me to take the poison.

106
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,800
I didn't doubt it.

107
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,800
I trusted you so much.

108
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,600
Tell me.

109
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,200
Why did you do this?

110
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,200
Why did you do this?

111
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,600
Didn't you say

112
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,200
you wanted to marry me?

113
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,000
Didn't you say

114
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,200
you would wait for my answer?

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I can tell you now.

116
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,400
I want to be with you.

117
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,600
You don't understand now.

118
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
One day,

119
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,600
you will understand.

120
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,400
She should be here soon.

121
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,400
Huan'er.

122
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,000
Huan'er.

123
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,400
Huan'er.

124
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
Where is my brother?

125
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,400
Let me ask you.

126
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,400
Where is my brother?

127
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,600
I have been thinking

128
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,600
for so many years.

129
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
Why?

130
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Why am I the one who survived?

131
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,800
If I were the one who survived,

132
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,800
my father, my mother,

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
and my brother,

134
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,200
would they have been dead long ago?

135
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
Huan'er.

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,400
But God

137
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,000
made me survive.

138
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,400
So I can't lose.

139
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
This...

140
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,800
This is the bone of Granny Su?

141
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
That's right.

142
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,800
What a good face.

143
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,800
You could have ordered the world

144
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,000
to fall into the hands of a crazy woman

145
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,400
to take the sky and the earth.

146
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
Brother.

147
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Brother.

148
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
Brother.

149
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Brother.

150
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
I am Huan'er.

151
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,000
I am your Huan'er.

152
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Huan'er.

153
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
You are Huan'er.

154
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,800
Let's go home.

155
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Go home.

156
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Brother.

157
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,800
Go home.

158
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
Go.

159
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Go.

160
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
Brother.

161
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,600
Ji Su.

162
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
Huan'er.

163
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,900
How was your injury?

164
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,100
No, no no...

165
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,120
Listen, you shaft is broken,

166
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,200
and now it's broken.

167
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,740
Thanks for the doctor's treatment.

168
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,620
You still want to save people?

169
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,100
I know how it feels.

170
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,080
I will protect you.

171
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,820
I will protect you, Also,

172
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,440
help me take care of those characters.

173
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,080
Be a scholar and protect yourself.

174
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,520
Fuhua!

175
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,520
I, Jiang Wen Feng,

176
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,120
would rather die than be a puppet

177
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,120
of others.

178
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,720
Brother!

179
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,120
Brother.

180
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,920
Brother.

181
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
It's about to be over.

182
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,120
Now it's over.

183
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,720
We can be together forever.

184
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,720
Gongsun Wu Yu.

185
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,920
My brother is so sincere to you.

186
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,720
But you hurt him.

187
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,320
You really lost your life.

188
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,320
I, Jiang Wen Feng, was blinded

189
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,720
by your many years of failure.

190
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,920
Huan.

191
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,320
Don't you want to know

192
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,920
what is the immortal medicine?

193
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,920
I'll tell you now.

194
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,320
I,

195
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,520
the original name is Tushan Xuan Yin.

196
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,320
My clan

197
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,920
was a child of a three-year-old

198
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,520
who was possessed by an old man.

199
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,920
He died in the hands of the Marquis Ying.

200
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,720
I was pregnant with him.

201
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,720
It was between the two of us.

202
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,920
I was forced to take the medicine.

203
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,320
I was completely fine.

204
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,120
But I

205
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,520
gave birth to a dying baby.

206
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,720
I was so sad

207
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,720
that I wanted to go with my clan.

208
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,320
Look, he's still alive.

209
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,520
Who is it?

210
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,720
But at that time,

211
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,320
my baby

212
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,120
was actually alive.

213
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,720
And his blood

214
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,320
can turn the dead into

215
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,920
a living monster.

216
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,520
That's when I knew

217
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,920
the immortal medicine of Changshan

218
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,320
that Sheng An had was this.

219
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,520
The nine tails of the body, the immortal medicine spirit,

220
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,920
the mother is the medicine and the son is the body.

221
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,920
The so-called way to make the immortal medicine

222
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,120
is to take Tushan's daughter and make her pregnant.

223
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,520
When the moon comes,

224
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,720
let her drink

225
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,120
the nine tails of the body

226
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,920
that had been made for three days and three nights.

227
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,720
The baby

228
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,320
will be the immortal medicine spirit.

229
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,120
Enough.

230
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,320
I don't want to hear this kind of nonsense.

231
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,520
You have to hear it.

232
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,320
This is the sin that your ancestors made.

233
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,720
Your Shangshan

234
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,720
owes the blood of our Tushan clan.

235
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,120
You can't pay off the debt forever.

236
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,720
Ill-fated.

237
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,120
The sin of Sheng An, the grudge of Tushan,

238
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,120
the greed of Wang Shang,

239
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,720
how many innocent people are punished.

240
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,120
How can the blood of the people of Shangshan

241
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,520
wash away the blood of Tushan's ancestors?

242
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,920
It's just that the grudge is unpaid.

243
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,120
There is no end to it.

244
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,520
You don't have to pay for it.

245
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,520
You don't have to

246
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,320
use any means to

247
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,120
pay for it.

248
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,920
You have been walking on the wrong path.

249
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,720
What's the difference between you and the Martial Soul Army you talk about?

250
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,720
You call my world a palace.

251
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,320
The people are great.

252
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,520
It turns out that in your eyes,

253
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,320
it's all lies.

254
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
You're crazy.

255
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,920
I'm not crazy.

256
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,920
How can I live to this day?

257
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,520
At first,

258
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,520
I was the son of Duke Ning.

259
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,320
I was a lovelorn.

260
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,920
But I failed.

261
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,520
He bit off one of my fingers.

262
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,720
But when I told Duke Ning,

263
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,120
his son

264
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,520
was the one with the long tail.

265
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,120
Shut up!

266
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,520
It's not my son.

267
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,320
Even if I lose ten fingers,

268
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,720
it's worth it.

269
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,120
Later,

270
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,720
in order to get the Human Skin Bone,

271
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,320
I used the Xuan Xuan Skill

272
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,720
to destroy the Kun Family.

273
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,520
But that Saintess Su Ying was so active

274
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,720
that she destroyed all the Human Skin Bones.

275
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,720
I had to

276
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,520
use the Zhongli Skill

277
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,320
that I wanted to take revenge on

278
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,120
to let her take care of me secretly.

279
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,320
You knew

280
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,520
everything later.

281
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,120
You've been walking on the wrong path since the beginning.

282
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,920
What about us?

283
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,520
What's the difference between me and the demon?

284
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,120
We're your family.

285
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,520
I've tried to persuade you.

286
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,920
Many times,

287
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,720
whether you believe it or not,

288
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,320
I really don't want to hurt you.

289
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,920
Excuse me.

290
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,320
You always have a choice.

291
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,720
But the path you chose

292
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,520
is shameless.

293
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,920
It's a path that never ends.

294
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
Maybe.

295
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,920
Now you know

296
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,120
the origin of the Long-Living Deity Pill.

297
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,320
You also know

298
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,320
how to make the Long-Living Deity Pill.

299
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,720
So what?

300
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,320
Silly boy.

301
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,520
When you know all this,

302
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,120
you'll never be

303
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,520
the carefree Donglu Young Master.

304
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,520
In this world,

305
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,120
as long as someone knows

306
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,120
the existence of the Long-Living Deity Pill,

307
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,720
someone will always

308
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,320
get involved in the endless cycle of desire,

309
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,720
greed and death,

310
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,920
doubt and murder,

311
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,720
and live together.

312
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,720
I'm Jiang Wenfeng.

313
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,520
I'm 32 years old.

314
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,720
I'm from Donglu.

315
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,320
My father raised me in Donglu.

316
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,320
I want to serve Donglu in the army.

317
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,520
I haven't married yet.

318
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,920
I'm waiting for someone else.

319
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,320
I want to take him home

320
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,320
with a good reputation

321
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,120
and love him, protect him,

322
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,120
and take care of his child with him.

323
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,120
I want to be with him

324
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,520
in the whole of the world.

325
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,120
Until

326
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,920
I die.

327
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
Who taught you such a good word?

328
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,920
Who taught you such a good word?

329
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
I don't know.

330
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,520
Quan Lyu,

331
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,720
I didn't expect that in the end,

332
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,520
Quan Lyu,

333
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,520
let go.

334
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,920
Let go.

335
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,920
The wind blows the eyes of the beauty.

336
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,920
What are you looking at?

337
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,320
No one from the North Marquis's Mansion came.

338
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,120
No one from Xichuan either.

339
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,920
It seems that we are both hard-working people.

340
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,720
In the future, in the Crown Prince's Camp,

341
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,720
we can only warm each other up.

342
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,520
You're gone.

343
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,320
Who wants to drink?

344
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,720
I'm still waiting

345
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,720
to take you to find the beauty.

346
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:53,120
The wind blows the eyes of the beauty.

347
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,520
The tears of the past are left behind.

348
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,920
The wind blows the eyes of the beauty.

349
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:12,920
How many hearts are broken?

350
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:19,120
The rain water in the city

351
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,920
can't help but make people cry.

352
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,120
The great martial arts is broken.

353
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,920
Gongsun Wu is dead.

354
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,920
Everything is over.

355
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:43,320
The wind blows the eyes of the beauty.

356
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:51,520
The tears of the past are left behind.

357
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,320
The wind blows the eyes of the beauty.

358
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:04,520
The tears of the past are left behind.

359
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,320
We will meet again today and return together in the future.

360
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,720
The jade of eternity is left behind.

361
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,720
Have a sip.

362
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,320
How is it?

363
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,520
I told you that

364
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,520
the plum wine I made in Zhongli

365
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,520
is the best.

366
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,320
I didn't lie to you, did I?

367
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,720
This wine is really good.

368
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:47,920
I said,

369
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,520
but you are not a good person.

370
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,120
We agreed to live together until the end.

371
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,520
Why did you die first?

372
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,720
It's boring.

373
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,520
Anyway,

374
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,320
it's not the first time I've lied to you.

375
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,520
Brother Jiang, why do you need to get married?

376
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,320
That's right.

377
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,320
You are the only one who can

378
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,520
deceive me, Jiang Wen Huan, twice.

379
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,520
But,

380
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,320
just take it as I owe you in the past life.

381
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,320
You are the only one who can

382
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,720
deceive me, Jiang Wen Huan, twice.

383
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,920
I'm not a good person.

384
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,920
I'm not a good person.

385
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,120
I owe you in the past life.

386
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,320
You owe me in this life.

387
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,720
In the next life,

388
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,520
I will get it back one by one.

389
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,520
All right, I won't talk to you.

390
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,920
I'm going to send my brother and brothers home.

391
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,120
I still have my new mission to complete.

392
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,120
I still have a new path to walk.

393
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,520
I'm leaving.

394
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,520
Go forward.

395
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,720
Don't look back.

396
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,120
I knew you would come to see me off.

397
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,720
You are leaving again?

398
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,520
What about you?

399
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,320
I heard that His Majesty wants you to go to the capital to reward him.

400
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,520
I've already sent a letter of apology.

401
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,720
I won't go.

402
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,520
I'm leaving.

403
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,720
I'm leaving.

404
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,720
This time,

405
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,920
I should let you go, right?

406
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,520
Let's go.

407
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,720
Let's go.

408
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,120
There is a distance between Song's army and Qianli.

409
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,920
Let's stop here.

410
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,920
In this world,

411
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,520
there are only a few people I care about.

412
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,120
You must be fine.

413
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,720
Yes.

414
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,720
I'm leaving.

415
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,120
By the way,

416
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,320
what did you say when I left Donglu last time?

417
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,320
Did you hear that?

418
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:06,920
Nothing.

419
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,720
I wish you a safe journey.

420
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:14,920
I'm kidding.

421
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,120
I heard it.

422
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,120
His Majesty's imperial edict is coming soon.

423
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,120
Go back now.

424
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,920
See you.

425
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,520
I won't leave.

426
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,520
Take care.

427
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,720
His Majesty's imperial edict.

428
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,920
The imperial edict is coming soon.

429
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,520
The late emperor's death is coming soon.

430
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,520
The last day of the last year

431
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,520
is the end of the sword and the end of the white gourd.

432
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,720
The white gourd and the green wild gourd

433
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,120
are all due to the evil eye of immortality.

434
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,520
They should be self-sacrificed and self-sacrificed.

435
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,720
They are all because of the heart of God.

436
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,520
I will give this edict

437
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,720
to all the people and the world.

438
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,520
Since then,

439
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,920
there is no more witchcraft in the land of Shangshan.

440
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,320
There is no more death in the land of Putian.

441
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,920
Instructor.

442
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,520
Chaosator.

443
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:32,920
Look.

444
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,320
Dont play tricks at the gate.

445
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,920
Get in there and keep the door locked.

446
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,920
ç

447
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,440
Taikun,

448
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,200
bring the water here.

449
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,320
I didn't expect that a war

450
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,520
would ruin Zhongli's century-old business.

451
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,640
Your hand...

452
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,640
Here.

453
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,640
Here.

454
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,640
Here.

455
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,640
Here.

456
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,640
Take it to that side.

457
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,640
If it's gone, it's gone.

458
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,640
At least one life has been saved.

459
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,640
I think...

460
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,640
I think it's gone.

461
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,640
It's gone.

462
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,640
It's gone.

463
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,640
It's gone.

464
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,960
I think

465
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,960
this is good.

466
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,960
At least I borrowed my poison.

467
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,960
The mystery of Zhongli

468
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,960
should be gradually disbanded.

469
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,960
As long as someone is still here,

470
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,960
Zhongli is not really ruined.

471
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,960
Maybe

472
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,960
we all have to protect it.

473
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,960
Is it the fire of the mortal world?

474
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,960
Hero!

475
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,960
Heroes,

476
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,960
I

477
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,960
take our whole family

478
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,960
to thank you

479
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,960
for saving Zhongli from the fire.

480
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,960
This cake

481
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,960
is not something rare.

482
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,960
It's my little intention

483
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,960
to give it to you.

484
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,960
Thank you, old man.

485
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,960
You're welcome.

486
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,960
I remember

487
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,960
He Shen...

488
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,960
No.

489
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,960
It should be Kunwu.

490
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,960
He's the best.

491
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,280
This should be it.

492
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,280
Brother Qiang,

493
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,280

How come he legend?

574
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,280
You moral sense was so bad.

575
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,280
You're a good mirror if I can go there later.

576
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,280
I miss you the most
