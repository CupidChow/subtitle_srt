1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,640
The broken dream in the breath

2
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,360
Even time can be far away

3
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,520
Prepare to change

4
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,080
The most unscrupulous street

5
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,560
The nation is warm and the snow is melting

6
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,080
In the distance, I have no limits

7
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,840
Even if time is tired and determined

8
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,720
Look at the small and long night, the bitter and happy days

9
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,880
The years and months in front of you

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,640
The sky is made of a mountain

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,920
The clouds are open, the clouds are clear

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,520
The sky is made of a blade

13
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,080
Love and dreams are eternal

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,640
Unable to stop the heart from meeting the heaven and earth

15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,400
Only for the end in each other's hearts

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,960
Until the dawn breaks

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,920
Never stop

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,560
Episode 4

19
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,920
Prince Kun, you are the descendant of the Kun family.

20
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,480
You must remember that the Kun family will never be defeated.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,160
Bless me, A Yan.

22
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,320
Your Majesty, Kun family is surrounded by the Jin family.

23
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,680
Are they all dead?

24
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,680
What about Kun Ze's children?

25
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,480
There is a little boy who jumped into the river while chasing after the tribe.

26
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,200
Don't worry, he must not be able to live.

27
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,120
Your Majesty, there is a little girl here.

28
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,160
State Preceptor, there is a little girl here.

29
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,240
Isn't this Su Ying's daughter?

30
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,880
Is she the daughter of the Su family?

31
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,480
Heaven is really helping me.

32
00:02:47,760 --> 00:03:06,400
Did you collect the royal knot from Zhang Yan

33
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,400
I was forced to die in the river

34
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
and was forced to die in the dark.

35
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,400
I was so selfish and ungrateful.

36
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,900
I was so reckless.

37
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
The day I left Zhongli,

38
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,400
I found out that the God of Mountain Shang

39
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
was reporting to the world.

40
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,400
My father wanted to rebel.

41
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,900
He killed my mother in Zhongli Palace.

42
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
He also said that he was crazy

43
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,400
and killed the whole Kun family.

44
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,400
This crime was brought to the Heaven.

45
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,900
The whole Kun family became monsters.

46
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,400
The Kun family became monsters.

47
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,400
The Kun family died.

48
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
Since the death,

49
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,900
the Kun family became the support of Zhongli.

50
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
The Saintess died.

51
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,900
The Yousu Clan also died.

52
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
You just said that

53
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,400
the Yousu Clan was in danger.

54
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
The Saintess's pulse was changed by the God.

55
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
What does this mean?

56
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,900
The Yousu Clan

57
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
has a custom of practicing magical arts since ancient times.

58
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,900
However,

59
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,400
the Yousu Clan now

60
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,400
only plays tricks.

61
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,400
Only the Saintess pulse

62
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,400
is normal.

63
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,900
After the blood pulse is awakened,

64
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,400
she can master magical arts

65
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
and can seduce people

66
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,900
to create an illusion.

67
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,900
Su Qingqing has this ability?

68
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,900
Then why didn't she

69
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,400
think of a way to escape these years?

70
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,900
She has been controlled by the Xuan Xuan Skill for a long time.

71
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,900
She can't use magical arts.

72
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,400
So,

73
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,900
the only person who can save her

74
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,900
is me.

75
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,400
It seems that

76
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,900
you are not afraid of danger.

77
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,900
Yes.

78
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,900
Have you ever thought about

79
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
if you fail,

80
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,900
even if you die,

81
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,900
I must go.

82
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
You are not afraid of death.

83
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Are you afraid of me,

84
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
or of Zhen Er Shun?

85
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,400
If your identity is exposed,

86
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,900
how will the Nambuo Mansion kill itself?

87
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
The Nambuo Mansion uses you.

88
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,400
You can ignore their lives.

89
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,900
What about the Crown Prince Camp?

90
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Have you ever thought

91
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,900
if your actions

92
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,400
would involve the Crown Prince Camp?

93
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
My Lord,

94
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
the Secret Service of the Ghost House

95
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,400
has sent us a secret letter.

96
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Is the Crown Prince of Nambuo

97
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,900
really related to the Kun Family

98
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,400
as the secret letter said?

99
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
Zhong Li is thousands of miles away from the capital.

100
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,400
I've never heard of

101
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,400
any connection between the Kun Family and the Nambuo Marquis.

102
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
The message this person gave

103
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,900
is impossible to be wrong.

104
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,900
What we need to be sure is

105
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,900
whether the Crown Prince of Nambuo Marquis

106
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,400
is the son of the Kun family

107
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,900
or the son of Kun Ze,

108
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Kun Wu.

109
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,400
Has Mr. Er Shun

110
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,400
ever come to the Kun Mansion?

111
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,900
No.

112
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,900
This is a strange matter.

113
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,900
We must be careful.

114
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,900
Go and get someone here.

115
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,900
It seems that our plan is going to change.

116
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,900
Yes.

117
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,400
The person who should have died seven years ago...

118
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,900
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,900
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,900
This time,

121
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,400
we must

122
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
get rid of the grass and root.

123
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,900
I've thought about all of this.

124
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,400
I've let you down.

125
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,400
I once lost all my hope.

126
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
I've lived

127
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
for myself

128
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
and I've been longing for it.

129
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
Until one day,

130
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,400
I met you in the slave market.

131
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
You saved me that day

132
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,400
and said that you would train me

133
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,400
to be the bravest warrior in the Eastland.

134
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,400
I don't have to learn to be a slave anymore.

135
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
At that time, I realized

136
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
that I've knelt for too long

137
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
and forgot

138
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,900
how to be a dignified Kun family god.

139
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,900
So...

140
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,900
So you lied to me.

141
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,900
It's not like that.

142
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,900
I... I gave you a chance.

143
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,900
Didn't I? But you still

144
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,900
chose to go to Zhongli Palace alone.

145
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,900
But Qingqing is my last family.

146
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,900
I promised my father

147
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
that I would protect him.

148
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
I promised my father

149
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
that I would be Kunwu.

150
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,400
But who are you now?

151
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,400
You're the evil god of the Crown Prince Camp.

152
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
You're a slave I got from the street.

153
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Who are you?

154
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
You're right.

155
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
Who am I?

156
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,400
Kunwu

157
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
He Shun

158
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Chen Qing

159
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,900
or Jia Yi?

160
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,400
I can't tell.

161
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
Uncle.

162
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,900
He's already apologized.

163
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,900
Besides, he hasn't done anything

164
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,900
that he's sorry about the Crown Prince Camp for so long.

165
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,400
It's all because of the times.

166
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
If he did something that he's sorry about the Crown Prince Camp,

167
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,900
I can't let him live.

168
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,900
Then how should we call you?

169
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,900
He Shun or Kunwu?

170
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,900
You can call me Kunwu He Shun.

171
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,900
From now on,

172
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,900
I, He Shun, will only have the Crown Prince of Nanbo.

173
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,900
I'll never be Kunwu.

174
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,900
The Crown Prince Camp orders

175
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,900
the Crown Prince to open the door.

176
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,900
What did he say in the middle of the night?

177
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,900
Did they find out

178
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,900
He Shun's true identity?

179
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,900
If that's the case,

180
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,900
it has nothing to do with you.

181
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,900
You're being deceived by me.

182
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,900
I won't get you into trouble.

183
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,900
What trouble?

184
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Let me tell you.

185
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,900
We can solve this together.

186
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
We'll talk about this

187
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,900
in the future.

188
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
We'll talk about this

189
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
between brothers.

190
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
Wait.

191
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
If they really know

192
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
He Shun's identity,

193
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
they should have come in a long time ago.

194
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
He Shun orders

195
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
the Crown Prince to order

196
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
to open the door.

197
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

198
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,400
What are you doing

199
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,400
in the middle of the night?

200
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,400
This young man

201
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
is not sleeping at night

202
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,400
and is sitting in the yard with his weapon.

203
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
My brother likes to practice martial arts in the middle of the night.

204
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,400
Can't he?

205
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
Just like how the State of Zhongli

206
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
likes to pass the imperial edict at night.

207
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
What's wrong?

208
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
Is there a problem?

209
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,400
No.

210
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
You're really joking.

211
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,400
What's the plan of the State Preceptor?

212
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,400
His Majesty asked me to inform you

213
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,400
that the ceremony of the wedding

214
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
will be held in advance tomorrow.

215
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
I'm here to deliver the letter.

216
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
In advance?

217
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,400
Tonight, a thief broke into the palace.

218
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
The State Preceptor was shocked

219
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,400
and became worse.

220
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,900
In order to prevent any trouble,

221
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,900
I hope that all the young men

222
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,900
will be there tomorrow.

223
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,900
Retreat!

224
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,900
Your Majesty,

225
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,900
the letter has been delivered.

226
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,900
Did you find anything?

227
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,900
The Crown Prince of the South Marquis

228
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,900
does have the bloodstain.

229
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,900
I'm sure that

230
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,900
he's the one who broke into the palace tonight.

231
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,900
It seems that

232
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,900
the remnant of the Kun family

233
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,900
has appeared.

234
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,900
He turned around

235
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,900
and became the Crown Prince of the South Marquis.

236
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,900
He's the Crown Prince of the South Marquis.

237
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,400
Good.

238
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
No matter who you pretend to be,

239
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,400
I have to

240
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
tear off your mask.

241
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,400
At the ceremony of the wedding tomorrow,

242
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,400
arrange for the ambush and attack

243
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,400
around the palace.

244
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
Your Majesty, you want to

245
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
kill the enemy in the wind?

246
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
Yes.

247
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,900
There's not enough evidence

248
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,900
to make it easy to alert the enemy.

249
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,900
When the ceremony of the wedding

250
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,900
is held tomorrow,

251
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,900
if the evil young master doesn't come,

252
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,900
the wedding will be held as usual.

253
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,900
Let's talk about the remnant first.

254
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,900
But if the evil young master

255
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,900
dares to come to save the person,

256
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,900
I can reveal

257
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,900
the identity of the remnant of the Kun family.

258
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,900
I'll be careful.

259
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,900
Kill him on the spot.

260
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,900
Kill the Kun family

261
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,900
as soon as possible.

262
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,900
Yes.

263
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,900
Who is it?

264
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,900
What?

265
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,900
Are you going to be the god of the door?

266
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,900
This cup

267
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,900
is to offer you

268
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,900
to save me from the fire.

269
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,900
The End

270
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,520
Deроп because not want to protect me

271
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,520
And then I shall...

272
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:36,160
Insert this uσp intoCómo renuncio

273
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,960
Don't be afraid

274
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,960
Take this time to take care of myself

275
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,800
Don't be afraid

276
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,240
I will millimeter

277
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,280
And change

278
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,520
Ooh

279
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,440
これで

280
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:44,980
•

281
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,840
This glass

282
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,920
This glass

283
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,400
You are the first one.

284
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,880
Between us,

285
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,840
I owe you a lot.

286
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,480
I told Donglu with Fei Ge

287
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
that my identity

288
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,480
is not related to you.

289
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,480
My actions

290
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
are all from Si Chou.

291
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,480
It has nothing to do with the Lion's Camp.

292
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,480
I won't get you into trouble.

293
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,480
Tell them that I can come back safely tomorrow.

294
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,480
I owe you.

295
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,480
I'll pay you back slowly.

296
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,480
Tell them that I can't come back.

297
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
I'll pay you back.

298
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,480
I'll pay you back.

299
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,480
Do you mind?

300
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
I've fed this stupid pigeon.

301
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,480
I want to tell Donglu

302
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,480
that you don't care if I, the Crown Prince of Donglu, agree or not.

303
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,480
You know that

304
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
you can't stop me.

305
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,480
Then try to walk out of this room.

306
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,480
I'm sorry.

307
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,480
I can't let you take the risk.

308
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,480
It's useless.

309
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480
Brother Jiang's method of kidnapping

310
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,480
is quite old-fashioned.

311
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,480
What time is it?

312
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,480
Don't worry about the time.

313
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,480
Just stay here.

314
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,480
Brother Jiang said

315
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,480
as long as you can stay here for one day,

316
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,480
the Lion's Camp and you

317
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,480
will have a way to protect yourself.

318
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,480
Let me go.

319
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,480
Brother Jiang.

320
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,480
Don't waste your energy, Brother Kun.

321
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,480
Childe Chong.

322
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,480
Childe Chong.

323
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,480
You will never care about my life.

324
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,480
Let me go.

325
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,480
I don't have any doubts about you.

326
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,480
Brother Chong, he has a good identity.

327
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,480
The South Capital is the fire of the Mian Clan.

328
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,480
Helping him is helping your brother.

329
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,480
I don't care about your life.

330
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,480
But if you die,

331
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,480
that person can't live either.

332
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,480
Then you go back.

333
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,480
You go back to your house.

334
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,480
You go back to your room.

335
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,480
And leave here.

336
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,480
Go.

337
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,480
Go.

338
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,480
Where is Jiang Wenhuan?

339
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,480
Where is Jiang Wenhuan?

340
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,480
Jiang Wenhuan!

341
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,480
Jiang Wenhuan!

342
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,000
I will forget it.

343
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,320
The poisons in the bottle

344
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,960
are the antidotes I got from the pace

345
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,000
yesterday.

346
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,400
This is the medicine.

347
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,000
Thing Genesis lady has to deliver.

348
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,080
But there's a time limit.

349
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,080
The blood medicine my sister made

350
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,280
can only keep you half a minute away from the world.

351
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,240
Half a minute will be a lot of energy.

352
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,520
I've been to the altar last night.

353
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,720
There are fifty steps from the entrance to the altar.

354
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,960
I'll create a chaos in the crowd

355
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,360
to distract the priest from the entrance.

356
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,280
As long as you can use your magical powers

357
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,440
to make people unconscious,

358
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
someone will take you away

359
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,400
before half an hour.

360
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,040
I'll go.

361
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,520
Brother Xin Jia,

362
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
you have to let me go.

363
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,240
Before Brother Jiang left,

364
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,000
he told me many times

365
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,720
that I can't...

366
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,360
Jiang Wen Huan, you have to save him yourself.

367
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,640
I'll untie it for you.

368
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:52,880
Wait.

369
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,440
Brother Chong is at the door.

370
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,080
Watch me act later.

371
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,480
It's about to start.

372
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,480
His time has come.

373
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,560
No matter how you fight,

374
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,840
whatever you do, it's all for nothing.

375
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,080
Fate

376
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,360
can never change.

377
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,240
Go back.

378
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,840
Brother Chong, don't be impulsive.

379
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,560
Your life

380
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,440
will be changed by Jiang Wen Huan.

381
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,640
Go back.

382
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,760
Don't think I dare not kill you.

383
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,280
That's why

384
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,880
I can't let him take my risk.

385
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,720
I don't want to talk to you.

386
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,800
We're all brothers.

387
00:21:59,320 --> 00:21:59,760
Brother Chong,

388
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:00,840
Brother He Sheng,

389
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,000
why don't you go back first?

390
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,360
I can run.

391
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,840
I'm coming.

392
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,840
Let me go.

393
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,840
Let go.

394
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,800
One more time.

395
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,000
Let me go.

396
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:27,860
God gave his

397
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,240
life to us.

398
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,880
Keep your love high.

399
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,560
Jia Wenhui!

400
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,120
Why are you here?

401
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,160
Why did you save my life?

402
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,320
They are innocent and want to die.

403
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,280
I'm the leader of the Crown Prince's Battalion.

404
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,360
I promised to protect you and go back without a sound.

405
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,320
I'll do whatever I say.

406
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,620
far from their capital,

407
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,920
who is loyal to the people?

408
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,000
My Lord.

409
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,080
Is he here?

410
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,360
After seeing him,

411
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,160
the

412
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,720
he people

413
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,960
will be

414
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,680
married in advance

415
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,260
the

416
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,380
sword

417
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,480
Bring it here.

418
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,240
It's already happening...

419
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,160
Damn it...

420
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,980
Have our ritual started already?

421
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,960
Go away!

422
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,580
Go away!

423
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:07,980
Brother.

424
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,140
Brother Jiang?

425
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:36,660
families in Schwann46

426
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,720
I'm so worried!

427
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,320
God bless you!

428
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,440
God bless you!

429
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,600
Where is Jinxin?

430
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,800
Don't panic.

431
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,840
There is one more person who can save her.

432
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,600
God bless you!

433
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,520
God bless you!

434
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,680
God bless you!

435
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,440
God bless you!

436
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,840
God bless you!

437
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,120
God bless you!

438
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,000
God bless you!

439
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,280
God bless you!

440
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,040
God bless you!

441
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,960
God bless you!

442
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,680
God bless you!

443
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,640
God bless you!

444
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,440
God bless you!

445
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,440
God bless you!

446
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,840
God bless you!

447
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,040
What do you mean by God?

448
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,920
Listen to me carefully.

449
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,440
The fake crown prince and the imperial concubine who were wanted by the whole city

450
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,960
are all dead.

451
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,000
You have to find them back.

452
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,880
No matter they are alive or dead.

453
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,520
Yes.

454
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,360
Yes.

455
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,240
The fake crown prince and the imperial concubine who were wanted by the whole city

456
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,760
Kunwu,

457
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,640
you will not escape from my hands this time.

458
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,000
Su Jinxin's fate has changed.

459
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,040
How could it be?

460
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,240
Fate,

461
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,160
can it really change?

462
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,440
Stop!

463
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,640
Go after them! Don't let them escape!

464
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,640
Stop!

465
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,920
It's fake!

466
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,280
Sister Yiyou, why is it you?

467
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,640
Sister Yiyou,

468
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,960
are you okay?

469
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,720
You taught the girl.

470
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,840
Then, where is the girl?

471
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,680
You remember?

472
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,120
Look!

473
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,200
They won't escape!

474
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,400
Excuse me.

475
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,080
Go over there.

476
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,080
Testing.

477
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,520
It's weird.

478
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,520
I saw a shadow here just now.

479
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,520
Jingjing.

480
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,520
Brother Kuang Wu.

481
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,520
Are you okay?

482
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,520
I'm fine.

483
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,520
Okay.

484
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,520
Let's go.

485
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,520
You go first. I'll distract them.

486
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,520
What about you?

487
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,520
Don't worry. I can easily get rid of them by myself.

488
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,520
We'll meet outside the city.

489
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,520
But...

490
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,520
Don't say that.

491
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,520
After all,

492
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,520
you have to protect her no matter what.

493
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,520
Don't you?

494
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,520
Go check the box over there.

495
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,520
Yes.

496
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,520
Hurry.

497
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,520
Thank you.

498
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,520
See you later.

499
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,520
This way.

500
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,520
Is that you?

501
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,520
Yes.

502
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,520
Is that you?

503
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,520
It's really because of you.

504
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,520
Who are you?

505
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,520
You...

506
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,520
are the one I've decided on.

507
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,520
You are my destiny.

508
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,520
What is destiny?

509
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,520
You should tell me about this.

510
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,520
Who are you?

511
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,520
Why can't I see your destiny?

512
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,520
I don't know.

513
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,520
Why can you change your destiny?

514
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,520
I don't know.

515
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,520
What is destiny?

516
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,520
Mr. Jiang.

517
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,520
I wonder how is your injury?

518
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,520
Although you are not in a critical condition,

519
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,520
you still need to recuperate.

520
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,520
I'm injured.

521
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,520
I'm sorry.

522
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,520
I'm sorry.

523
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,520
I'm sorry.

524
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,520
I'm sorry.

525
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,520
I'm sorry.

526
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,520
I'm sorry.

527
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,520
I'm injured.

528
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,520
I can't do anything.

529
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,520
Please forgive me.

530
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,520
You are injured.

531
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,520
You don't need to worry about these things.

532
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,520
But I have one thing that I don't understand.

533
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,520
Why did you get injured

534
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,520
near the altar?

535
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,520
I saw the Saintess was robbed.

536
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,520
I wanted to go up and capture the robber.

537
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,520
But I didn't expect that I would be injured by the robber.

538
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,520
But the Saintess appeared and scared away those people.

539
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,520
She saved me.

540
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,520
I have to thank the Saintess for saving my life.

541
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,520
I don't know how to repay the Saintess.

542
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,520
I'm sorry.

543
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,520
I'm just doing what you told me to do.

544
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,520
If you want to thank me,

545
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,520
you can thank the State Preceptor.

546
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,520
You are a great man.

547
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,520
It's my duty to protect you.

548
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:44,520
You don't need to be polite.

549
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,520
If so,

550
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,520
then you should take care of yourself.

551
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,520
Remember,

552
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,520
the two robbers who robbed the Saintess

553
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,520
are the ones who hurt you today.

554
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,520
Is this real enemy?

555
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,520
Is he really hurting me

556
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,520
to clear my name?

557
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,520
We are here.

558
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,520
The carriage arranged by Mr. Jiang is over there.

559
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,520
Okay.

560
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,520
This is the direction to leave the bell tower.

561
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,520
Where are we going?

562
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,520
Where is Jiang Chongren?

563
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,520
Qian Qing,

564
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,520
Qian Qing,

565
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,520
you have something to hide from me.

566
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,520
I'm sorry, Kunwu.

567
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,520
What do you mean?

568
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,520
This is what Mr. Jiang asked me to give you.

569
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,520
When you see this book,

570
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,520
