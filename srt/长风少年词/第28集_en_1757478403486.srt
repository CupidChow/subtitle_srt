1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,040
I hope we can be good friends, love and dream forever

2
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,640
I will never give up, I will never give up

3
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,400
Only for the destination in our hearts

4
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,000
Until the dawn breaks, we will never stop

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Episode 15

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,880
Jiang Xiong, you said earlier you want the people and officials of Zhongli to enter the city first

7
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,000
But they insist on waiting for you to come out

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,920
We thank the Heir Apparent for saving our lives on behalf of Zhongli

9
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,400
Thank the Heir Apparent for saving our lives

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,600
Thanks, my lord.

11
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,960
No need, everyone.

12
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,060
Please get up.

13
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,260
Don't move.

14
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,380
If anyone

15
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,180
speak ill of me today,

16
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,780
I'll beat them to death.

17
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,040
A good adult aid

18
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,720
how can he be protect

19
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,300
by such excellent and protection

20
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,820
turned and speculated

21
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,920
to save all the world ?

22
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:27,780
And will he living

23
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,900
and wide-minded

24
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:29,880
if we don't study

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,600
I will protect the people of Zhongli.

26
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,360
Thank you for saving my life!

27
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,120
Thank you for saving my life!

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,380
coopant

29
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,560
Did you really give the order striple?

30
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,120
Help me get what I want

31
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,260
I

32
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,220
Return Yiyang alive to you

33
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,880
After Yiyang returns

34
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,880
I will kill you.

35
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,120
If you want to avenge Yiyang,

36
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,120
what you should do

37
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,880
is to get the supreme power

38
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,720
and change the unfair world.

39
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,720
I just want you to know

40
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,120
how easy it is to die.

41
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,320
I have asked for help from the Eastland.

42
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,760
But I don't know when the reinforcements will arrive.

43
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,200
I sent people to check.

44
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,000
The surrounding gates of Zhongli City

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,360
have been surrounded by Taotie Army.

46
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,000
When the Zhongli Alliance was captured,

47
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,320
most of the soldiers

48
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:11,840
who could be used in Zhongli

49
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,840
were also killed.

50
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,720
There were only a few left.

51
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,240
Although it is difficult to fight against

52
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,880
a man who is injured,

53
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,120
the equipment is not good enough

54
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,560
and the training is not finished.

55
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,120
It will be difficult to use.

56
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
I will go to the south.

57
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
I will go to the south.

58
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,120
I will go to the south.

59
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
I will go to the south.

60
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,120
It is useless.

61
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,120
The enemy is attacking us.

62
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,120
If Taotie Army attacks us,

63
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,640
I am afraid

64
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,120
it will be broken in three days.

65
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,800
Can't we

66
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,800
leave Zhongli alive?

67
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
The people of the Great Lian

68
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,120
can't leave alive.

69
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,640
But if the Crown Prince Battalion breaks out at night,

70
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,680
we can escape.

71
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,920
If it were before,

72
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,640
I would take the method

73
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,240
that Miss A-Si mentioned.

74
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,840
But now,

75
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,240
although I am afraid of death,

76
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
I know that

77
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,240
a man's promise is worth a thousand gold.

78
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,840
Since I promised to protect the people of Zhongli,

79
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,840
I will never back down.

80
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,640
The only way is to fight back.

81
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,640
Tell all the people

82
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,640
to retreat to Zhongli Palace.

83
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,840
The Crown Prince Battalion should split into three groups

84
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,440
and guard the city gates.

85
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,840
Brother Jiang,

86
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,040
most of the people in the city are here.

87
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,240
But the city is too far from Zhongli Palace.

88
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,040
It will take some time for the people to come here.

89
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,640
Let's go.

90
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,640
Let them speed up.

91
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,840
In addition,

92
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,840
organize the people.

93
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,840
Team One, Xinjia, lead the team.

94
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,240
Lead the people of Qingzhuang

95
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,240
to guard the gate.

96
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,240
Team Two, E-Shun, lead the Crown Prince Battalion

97
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,640
to repair the traps at the gate

98
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
and prepare to ambush.

99
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,240
What are you doing?

100
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,040
Team Three, A-Si, lead the team.

101
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,440
Protect the old and the weak.

102
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,040
Hide them in the palace.

103
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,240
Lord Gongsun,

104
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,240
the Crown Prince Battalion and the rest of Zhongli

105
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,440
will guard the city gates

106
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,840
and will not surrender.

107
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,240
If we attack,

108
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,640
how many cities do you think

109
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,040
can take Zhongli City?

110
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,240
Don't worry.

111
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,240
Under the strong attack of the Taotie Army,

112
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,840
no city can last more than a day.

113
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,240
Good.

114
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,840
General, tonight,

115
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,240
act according to the plan.

116
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,840
Tonight, we will attack the city gates.

117
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,040
We will attack the city gates.

118
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,240
Let's have a try.

119
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,040
Look!

120
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,040
It's on fire!

121
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
What's going on?

122
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,640
It's on fire!

123
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,440
It's on fire!

124
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,040
Has the Taotie Army entered the city?

125
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,440
If so,

126
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,840
the whole city can't hold on.

127
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,440
No!

128
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,040
No!

129
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,640
No!

130
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,440
No!

131
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,040
No!

132
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,840
No!

133
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
No!

134
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,240
No!

135
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,840
No!

136
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,840
No!

137
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
My sister!

196
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,060
I'm a

197
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,060
I'm a

198
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,060
I'm a

199
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,060
I'm a

200
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,060
I'm a

201
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,060
I'm a

202
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,060
I'm a

203
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,060
I'm a

204
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,060
Are you okay?

205
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,900
I'm sorry.

206
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,980
Kun's family is gone.

207
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,580
Uncle Lin is gone.

208
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,220
Kun's army is gone too.

209
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:36,860
Now

210
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,500
even Chongli City is gone.

211
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,100
But why

212
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,180
I'm still alive?

213
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,140
It's not your fault.

214
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,420
But again and again

215
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,700
I couldn't stop anything.

216
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,060
Yeah.

217
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,100
We couldn't stop anything.

218
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,060
Young Master.

219
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,660
Old Zhao, you are...

220
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,780
Dried plum cake.

221
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,180
Have you ever eaten the cake made by me?

222
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,100
I ate it with my family when I was a kid.

223
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,100
Then

224
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,460
have a try.

225
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,220
Have a try.

226
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,660
It still tastes like my childhood.

227
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:01,940
How is it?

228
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,540
Actually, this cake

229
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,740
was made by my grandson.

230
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,500
My father

231
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,860
has been making cakes in Chongli City

232
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,620
for more than 40 years.

233
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,940
After my father died

234
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,740
I also have been making cakes in Chongli City

235
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,580
for more than 30 years.

236
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,340
Then my son

237
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,820
and my grandson

238
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,060
never changed

239
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,940
the taste of the cake.

240
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,220
If people are alive

241
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,180
their hearts are still there.

242
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,740
The people who have left

243
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,740
their past days

244
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,380
are still in their hearts.

245
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,460
If the house is gone

246
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,140
we can just build it again.

247
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,100
If the city is gone

248
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,500
we can just build it again.

249
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,220
The people of this city

250
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,260
are the roots of our Chongli.

251
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,980
And the people left

252
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,300
are the ones

253
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,700
who risked their lives

254
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,780
to protect them.

255
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,860
I'm here

256
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,780
to thank you

257
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,660
on behalf of the people.

258
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,020
Thank you, Your Highness.

259
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,140
No need.

260
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,340
Get up.

261
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,580
Your Highness.

262
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,060
It's too cold outside.

263
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,420
You should go back and rest.

264
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,260
Young Master, take care.

265
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:27,820
I saw you doing the

266
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,660
most important thing

267
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,660
at the court.

268
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:32,700
Yes.

269
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,020
And I love you as much as I can.

270
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,980
Don't cry, Master.

271
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,140
You sound

272
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,140
I'm very happy

273
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,340
just to let you know

274
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,500
that in the next few days,

275
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,740
if you challenge me,

276
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:54,580
I will have never

277
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,940
put up with Imao.

278
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,280
OK.

279
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,140
Have pity on me.

280
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,160
Give this to me to help with the cake.

281
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,440
You might need this.

282
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,340
You don't have to give it to anyone.

283
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,980
Just keep it for yourself.

284
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:13,140
I didn't expect that the winter in the south is quite cold.

285
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,940
This is cold?

286
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,340
Then you haven't seen the snow in Zhongli?

287
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:30,540
When it snows, it's very cold, but very beautiful.

288
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,740
You South people are very beautiful.

289
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:37,540
Although it's very cold, it's very beautiful.

290
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,140
The snow in the south is also called snow?

291
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,340
The snow in the south is called snow.

292
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:50,340
If you are lucky enough to see it, you will understand what I mean.

293
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,340
Okay, then I have to see

294
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,940
what the snow in the south is like.

295
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,540
Go.

296
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,940
Your Excellency, we haven't seen anyone ahead.

297
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:27,340
Let everyone be careful and start attacking the city.

298
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,940
All the troops, advance!

299
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,740
Archers, prepare!

300
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,740
Attack!

301
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,740
Attack!

302
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,740
Attack!

303
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,340
Attack!

304
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,540
The former king and the former queen, brothers, come with me!

305
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,740
Attack!

306
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,140
Attack!

307
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,740
Attack!

308
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,540
Attack!

309
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,540
Attack!

310
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,740
Cheng Yibiao, you cold-blooded, heartless, and cruel!

311
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,140
I am not worthy of being your brother.

312
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,540
I am blind!

313
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,740
You always say that I am a useless person,

314
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,540
but even a useless person like me knows

315
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,140
that I can't do such a thing that will hurt the people.

316
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,740
Is this the right path that you have prepared for the lower warriors?

317
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,060
The

318
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,940
iron flag is the king's personal gift.

319
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,140
Seeing the flag is like seeing the king.

320
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,940
If you don't surrender,

321
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,740
you will be treated as traitors to your motherland.

322
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,740
You will be punished for your crimes.

323
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,740
The iron flag will be placed on the mountain.

324
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,740
In the future, you will be able to

325
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,940
destroy your motherland and your family.

326
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,340
If you're not willing to surrender,

327
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,100
you have already

328
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,340
моčĭčĐŠĆŦŪĹŤĜĘŽ poem for her.

329
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,140
exaggerated

330
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,060
Book 3

331
00:19:43,740 --> 00:20:02,900
the

332
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,140
Why don't you think of a way to fight against the outsiders?

333
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,140
I'm afraid of death, so I didn't do anything wrong!

334
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,140
Uncle, you're always talking about Kang Kai Qi.

335
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,140
Why are you always changing your ways when you encounter problems?

336
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,140
Speak!

337
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,140
We are not afraid of death,

338
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,140
but our family members are not willing to sacrifice their lives for us.

339
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,140
It's only right to protect the people of Zhongli.

340
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,140
But if we lose the five states,

341
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,140
we will be turned into a crime of unfilial piety.

342
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,140
Who would have thought that Gongsun Jian Chan would send out the royal flag?

343
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,140
You're afraid of that broken flag, aren't you?

344
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,140
I'll go and cut it right now!

345
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,140
No!

346
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,140
The symbol of the royal family of the Taotie Army

347
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,140
will be destroyed like a cat's tail!

348
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,140
It will surely affect the five states!

349
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,140
By then, all the nine clans will be destroyed!

350
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,140
I, Kun Wu,

351
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,140
ask for punishment from the head of the Crown Prince's Camp.

352
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,140
Ah Shun.

353
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,140
I ask for punishment.

354
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,140
Everyone.

355
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:08,140
Actually, I am not the son of the Crown Prince of the South Marquis, Ah Shun.

356
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,140
I am here to seek revenge

357
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,140
by taking the throne of the Crown Prince's Camp.

358
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,140
My true identity

359
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,140
is the son of the loyal general of the Zhongli State,

360
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,140
the son of Kun Ze,

361
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,140
Kun Wu.

362
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,140
This...

363
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,140
He... He is not Ah Shun.

364
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,140
What's going on?

365
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,140
How could this be?

366
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,140
What's going on?

367
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,140
I deceived the King.

368
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,140
I deceived everyone.

369
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,140
I am also guilty.

370
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,140
Right now,

371
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,140
all of you

372
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,140
only have me.

373
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,140
I have nothing to worry about.

374
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,140
My motherland is in danger now.

375
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,140
I will go and take the throne.

376
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,140
What's the best way?

377
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,140
Ah Shun.

378
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,140
Ah Shun.

379
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,140
Kun Wu.

380
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,140
I don't care what your name is.

381
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,140
If you want to go with me,

382
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,140
I won't let you die alone.

383
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,140
Although I deceived everyone,

384
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,140
I still hope that

385
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,140
everyone present here

386
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,140
can be my witnesses

387
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,140
for the sake of our friendship.

388
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,140
From today onwards,

389
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,140
I am no longer the son of the Crown Prince's Camp.

390
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,140
I am just a Kun Wu of the Zhongli State.

391
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,140
What I did

392
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,140
was only to avenge the state.

393
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,140
It has nothing to do with the death of the traitors.

394
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,140
Go.

395
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,140
From now on,

396
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,140
I don't know you.

397
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,140
You

398
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,140
also don't know me.

399
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,140
Everyone is the master of the chess.

400
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,140
The dust is dust.

401
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,140
The soil is soil.

402
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,140
Look at it.

403
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,140
I am the master of the chess.

404
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,140
The dust is dust.

405
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,140
The soil is soil.

406
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,140
Look at it.

407
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,140
The soil is soil.

408
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,140
I regret not having met you.

409
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,140
I regret not having met you.

410
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,140
Do you know

411
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,140
what regret is waiting for you?

412
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,140
Brother Qiang.

413
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,140
Wait!

414
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,140
Don't let the bag getfooted.

415
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,140
It's oh so drunken!

416
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,140
It's oh so drunken!

417
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,140
Give me the fiddle!

418
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,140
Brother Qiang

419
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,140
Brother Qiang

420
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,740
I'll wait for you to come home.

421
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,140
I'll wait for you to come home.

422
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:55,140
If one day, I'm destined to fight for the Mugu.

423
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,140
Brother Jiang, you will definitely understand my choice.

424
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,140
As a man from the Kun family,

425
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,140
guarding the Zhongli is my mission.

426
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,140
I will protect you.

427
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,140
I will protect you.

428
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,140
I will protect you.

429
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,140
Guarding the Zhongli is my mission.

430
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,140
The river of Mount Lilan is the one that nourishes me.

431
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:32,140
One day, I will definitely

432
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,140
return to her embrace.

433
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,140
Everyone, go to the tower to protect me!

434
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,140
Everyone, shoot!

435
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,140
Protect me!

436
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,140
Sincerity is the source of good quality.

437
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,140
The ending will not be very good.

438
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,140
Eashun, be careful!

439
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,140
I'm sorry that I didn't teach you well.

440
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,140
Eashun!

441
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,140
What a pity.

442
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,140
I'm sorry.

443
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,140
Eashun!

444
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,140
Eashun!

445
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,140
Eashun!

446
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,140
Eashun!

447
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,140
I'm sorry.

448
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,140
Protect Brother Jiang!

449
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,140
Eashun!

450
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,140
Childe Cheng, it's your turn.

451
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,140
Eashun!

452
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,140
Watch out for the Zhongli!

453
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,140
You see?

454
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,140
The skin is hard and the hand is hard.

455
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,140
You're more practical than them.

456
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,140
Eashun!

457
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,140
Brother Eashun!

458
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,140
Eashun!

459
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,140
If you have the guts, go out with me!

460
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,140
The brothers of the Fourteenth Camp will die together!

461
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:09,140
The Kun's Army will never retreat!

462
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,140
Eashun!

463
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,140
Guo Wu!

464
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,140
We're coming!

465
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,140
We're coming!

466
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,140
Don't come!

467
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,140
Eashun!

468
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,140
Eashun!

469
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,140
Eashun!

470
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,140
Even if the skin is rotten,

471
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:22,140
it can still be very sweet.

472
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,140
Eashun!

473
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,140
Eashun!

474
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,140
Eashun!

475
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,140
Eashun!

476
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,140
Eashun!

477
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,140
Eashun!

478
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,140
Eashun!

479
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,140
Eashun!

480
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,140
Eashun!

481
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,140
Eashun!

482
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,140
Eashun!

483
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,140
Eashun!

484
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,140
Eashun!

485
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,140
We've drunk together.

486
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,140
We're brothers who have been punished and killed.

487
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,140
If you need anything,

488
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,140
can we not trust you to help you?

489
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,140
May the God bless you!

490
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,140
I'm sorry.

491
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,140
I'm sorry.

492
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,140
I'm sorry.

493
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,140
I'm sorry.

494
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,140
I'm sorry.

495
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,140
I'm sorry.

496
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,140
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

500
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,140
I'm sorry.

501
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,140
I'm sorry.

502
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,140
I'm sorry.

503
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,140
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

518
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,140
