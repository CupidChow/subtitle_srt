1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,040
Even if we are separated, we will never stop loving each other.

2
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,600
We will never give up our hearts to each other.

3
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,400
We will always be together until the end.

4
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,000
Until our lives are over, we will never stop.

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The End

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Episode 18

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,320
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

8
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,320
Humph.

9
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,320
Where does the joy come from?

10
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,320
Congratulations, Your Majesty, on saving the country,

11
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,320
using the sword to kill people,

12
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,320
and achieving your dream.

13
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,320
You have become the master of Zhongli.

14
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,320
Now, I am the one who should be congratulating myself.

15
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,320
I am afraid that I have gone too far.

16
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,320
Jiang Wenhuan and others are still living in the human world.

17
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,320
If they don't die,

18
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,320
how can I, the ruler, be able to sit still?

19
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,320
What?

20
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,320
You didn't know about this?

21
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,320
I did follow the orders of His Majesty

22
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,320
and led them into the underground city.

23
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,320
But after they entered,

24
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,320
they came out again.

25
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,320
They really came out?

26
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,320
The real person looks very surprised.

27
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,320
The ancient tomb of Yousu has always been interesting.

28
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,320
Since they entered as ordered by His Majesty,

29
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,320
they shouldn't have come out again.

30
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,320
Does the real person want to know

31
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,320
what is underneath the ancient tomb of Yousu?

32
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,320
I only followed the orders of His Majesty

33
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,320
and shouldn't have asked the state affairs.

34
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,320
But today,

35
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,320
I want to give you a chance to ask questions.

36
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,320
Do you have anything to ask me?

37
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,320
If I can't lead them into the underground city,

38
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,320
will you kill me?

39
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,320
How dare you!

40
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,320
Congratulations.

41
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,320
You have followed me for so many years.

42
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,320
You really know me well.

43
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,320
If you are soft-hearted and make a mistake,

44
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,320
the slaves who are hiding outside the entrance of the underground city

45
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,320
will kill you all.

46
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,320
Of course,

47
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,320
this is the situation I don't want to see.

48
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,320
Zhongli's people have always been the representatives of the Wang family.

49
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,320
They died in your hands.

50
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,320
It's more natural than dying in my hands.

51
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,320
It can make Zhong Liyuan

52
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,320
realize the crime of murdering the envoy.

53
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,320
Zhong Liyuan committed a crime of murdering the envoy

54
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,320
because of me.

55
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,320
Then what crime should I commit?

56
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,320
According to the law,

57
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,320
you should be killed.

58
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,320
I will die for the sake of the country.

59
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,320
Just kidding.

60
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,320
Don't worry.

61
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,320
I will never treat those loyal to me.

62
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,320
Qingluan Mountain is now my capital.

63
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,320
You are so sharp.

64
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,320
I can't take it away.

65
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,320
In my opinion,

66
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,320
can I win?

67
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,320
The dark tide is strong under the black water.

68
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,320
Your wish can be realized.

69
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,320
OK.

70
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,320
You have been working hard for the cause of the camp.

71
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,320
You can rest for a few days in the war room.

72
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,320
Just go to theación, and then take care.

73
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,320
Fine, fine.

74
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,320
Let's go.

75
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,320
How's it going?

76
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,320
It's good.

77
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,320
We can go back.

78
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,320
Mask off.

79
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,320
He doesn't know yet

80
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,320
that who's a establish for a family ofone알

81
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,320
If he doesn't know,

82
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,320
What's the benefit of us dying?

83
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,320
Once we die,

84
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,320
she can put the charges of murdering the Crown Prince

85
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
on Zhong Liyuan.

86
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,320
Then Zhong Li will have no master.

87
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,320
Then she can be the rightful owner

88
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,320
of the country.

89
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,320
Alright.

90
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,320
No matter what, it's already too late.

91
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,320
Don't care about the Xuan Ji or Tian Xuan Ji.

92
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,320
Just care about your own wound.

93
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,320
Sister Yi Yao, how can the poison

94
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,320
be cured?

95
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,320
The cure

96
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,320
will need to be studied by the blood crystal and the poison.

97
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,320
When can the antidote be cured?

98
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
I will do it as soon as possible.

99
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,320
The blood that was contaminated with the poison

100
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,320
is the food that grows with the blood.

101
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,320
I have used the medicine to control it.

102
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,320
But you can't use your inner power today.

103
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,320
If the blood is faster,

104
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,320
the poison will spread more.

105
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,320
Girl,

106
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,320
is there any way to use your inner power?

107
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,320
Yes.

108
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,320
You can force the poison to be cured.

109
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,320
But if you don't take the antidote in ten days,

110
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,320
the poison will be in the funeral home.

111
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,320
It's hard to cure.

112
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,320
Alright.

113
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,320
Ten days is enough.

114
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,320
What do you want to do?

115
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Go to Zhong Li Palace

116
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,320
and capture the Xuan Xuan Ji.

117
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,320
Save Zhong Li King? Why?

118
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,320
He will die

119
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,320
if he is trapped in Mount Qingluan.

120
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,320
That's right.

121
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,320
If the Xuan Xuan Ji is the leader,

122
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,320
we will die.

123
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,320
And,

124
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,320
Xuan Xuan Ji is the leader.

125
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,320
If he is the leader,

126
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,320
the people of Zhong Li will not escape.

127
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,320
We will

128
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,320
take this as a warning.

129
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,320
Alright.

130
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,320
Anyway, Uncle Heng is dead.

131
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,320
I have a good idea.

132
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,320
If we want to get out of Zhong Li,

133
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,320
we must kill Zhong Li Palace first

134
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,320
and save Zhong Li Yuan.

135
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,320
But your injury...

136
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,320
You are here.

137
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,320
Why do you let me die?

138
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,320
Right?

139
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,320
But,

140
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,320
our Shizi Camp is not that powerful.

141
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,320
If we want to attack Zhong Li Palace,

142
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,320
I'm afraid...

143
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,320
Mr. Jiang.

144
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,320
Mr. Jiang.

145
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,320
Mr. E Shun.

146
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,320
The blood feud between us and Xuan Xuan Ji

147
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,320
is not fair.

148
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,320
We will cooperate with Shizi Camp

149
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,320
when we succeed.

150
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,320
Thank you for your help.

151
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,320
But, Mr. Jiang,

152
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,320
in the battle,

153
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,320
do you know what is the most important?

154
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,320
It's trust.

155
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,320
If Shizi Camp can't trust me completely,

156
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,320
if there are still doubts

157
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,320
on the battlefield,

158
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,320
it's hard to fight against them.

159
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,320
We will fight against them.

160
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,320
As a comrade,

161
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,320
there will be no differences between

162
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,320
race, appearance, etc.

163
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,320
It depends on the character.

164
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,320
As long as we work together,

165
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,320
we can trust each other.

166
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
We can be friends on the battlefield

167
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
and we can live and die together.

168
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
Great.

169
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
We should work together

170
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,320
and trust each other.

171
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
Okay.

172
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,320
Let's kill Zhongli Palace together

173
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
and return Zhongli to peace.

174
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
And return Kun Jiang justice.

175
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
And,

176
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
we have to find a way to escape from

177
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,320
Qingluan Mountain.

178
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
Yes.

179
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
We can't go out now.

180
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,320
There are many cliffs on Xuan Xuan Street.

181
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
But Qingluan Mountain is complicated.

182
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,320
If we can't escape,

183
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
the terrain is complicated.

184
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,320
If we fight against Qingluan Mountain,

185
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
there will be a place for them to hide.

186
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,320
Jing Jing, think about it.

187
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
Is there any other way

188
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,320
to escape?

189
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Little girl,

190
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
I'll leave the antidote to you.

191
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
We can't be late.

192
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
We have to find a way out.

193
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
And we have to make a strategy.

194
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
What is the connection

195
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,320
between the blood crystal stone and the snake's poison?

196
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
Is it a wound?

197
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
It turns out that

198
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
if the blood crystal stone is made of blood

199
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,320
of the person who has been healthy,

200
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
he will be blood-related.

201
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
If the person who is poisoned

202
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,320
is not careful,

203
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320
he will be the host.

204
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
The blood of the Qing family

205
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,320
will cause him to die.

206
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
Little girl,

207
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,320
what's wrong?

208
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,320
You look pale.

209
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
I still can't find the way

210
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,320
to get out of Qingluan Mountain.

211
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
It's okay.

212
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
You haven't been to Qingluan Mountain for years.

213
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
What if there is a new road in the mountain?

214
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
It's normal that you don't know.

215
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
Only the people of the Su family

216
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,320
live in Qingluan Mountain.

217
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,320
Seven years ago, the Su family was confined to the forbidden area.

218
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
No one entered and left here.

219
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
What new way?

220
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
Be careful!

221
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
It's a map.

222
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
Brother Jiang!

223
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
Brother Jiang, look!

224
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
There was a arrow just now

225
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,320
that tied this thing.

226
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,320
This is the map of Zhongli Palace.

227
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,320
Could it be

228
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
that we have a lady to help us?

229
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
This is the map of Zhongli Palace.

230
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
The gate is long and wide.

231
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
The layout of the yard is the same

232
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,320
as the one I know.

233
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
There are some places that even I don't know.

234
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
That's good.

235
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,320
With this map,

236
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
we can fight against Zhongli Palace.

237
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,320
But who sent the map?

238
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,320
Is it the enemy or the friend?

239
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
The real person is the Prime Minister.

240
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,320
Why did you tell me the clues?

241
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,320
Aren't you afraid

242
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
that the country will blame me?

243
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,320
Didn't you already get the answer you wanted?

244
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,320
Then whose person am I?

245
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
Is it important to you?

246
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
Could it be her?

247
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,320
You mean

248
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
Gu Xi Zhen Yan?

249
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
What kind of woman is she?

250
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
That's useless.

251
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
Who knows if she's giving us a chance?

252
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
Brother, take the senior to prepare.

253
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
I'll go.

254
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
Does it hurt?

255
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,320
It's been a long time.

256
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
I'll help you.

257
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,320
Bear with it.

258
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
There's a butterfly.

259
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,320
Okay.

260
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,320
You haven't recovered yet.

261
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,320
You shouldn't think too much.

262
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,320
Don't move your hand.

263
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
Don't move your hand.

264
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
Don't move your hand.

265
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
I just don't understand

266
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
what the purpose

267
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
of the letter is.

268
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
It seems to belong to the State Preceptor.

269
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,320
It's said that

270
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,320
Jiang Wen Kun was trapped in a forest.

271
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320
And now,

272
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,320
this letter

273
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,320
has made us go to the palace.

274
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,320
You mean

275
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,320
Gu Xi Zhen Yan

276
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,320
is behind her?

277
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
Yes.

278
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
But who is behind her?

279
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,320
It's hard to tell.

280
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
But it's good.

281
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
We know that the enemy is our friend.

282
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,320
It means that

283
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
this picture

284
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,320
is more credible.

285
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,320
Your Majesty,

286
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,320
I have an urgent report.

287
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
Your Majesty,

288
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,320
I just received a secret letter

289
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,320
from Jiang Wen Huan, the Crown Prince of Eastland.

290
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,320
He said that the Central Plains was under the control of Xian Xuan Ji

291
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,320
and the Crown Prince of the Central Plains was in danger.

292
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,320
He framed the master of Central Plains

293
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,320
and deceived His Majesty.

294
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,320
Are the princes all right?

295
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
Your Majesty,

296
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,320
the princes have broken through

297
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,320
the besieged area of Mount Qingluan

298
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,320
and are preparing to attack the Central Plains at night

299
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
to save the master of the Central Plains.

300
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,320
But Xian Xuan Ji

301
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,320
has been trapped in the Central Plains.

302
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,320
So he wants to use the power of Mount Shang

303
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,320
to get rid of the Central Plains.

304
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
He is waiting for me.

305
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
How dare Xian Xuan Ji

306
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,320
deceive me!

307
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
Your Majesty.

308
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,320
Your Majesty,

309
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
seven years ago,

310
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,320
I didn't waste a single soldier

311
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
to take the Central Plains

312
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,320
to the people of Mount Shang.

313
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,320
Xian Xuan Ji

314
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
has a plan

315
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
and a great contribution.

316
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,320
So I gave him

317
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,320
the decree of the Central Plains.

318
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
These years,

319
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
he has been developing

320
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
and I have been very generous.

321
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,320
I didn't expect

322
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,320
that he would

323
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
be so generous to his son.

324
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,320
Today,

325
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
he dares to give up

326
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
the position of the master of Central Plains.

327
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,320
Tomorrow,

328
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,320
he dares to give up

329
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,320
my country.

330
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,320
A'Qing,

331
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,320
you and the Eagle Division

332
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:29,280
have a

333
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,320
great chance.

334
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,320
I will do it.

335
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
You are so stingy.

336
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,320
How is it?

337
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,320
With the magic potion of our family,

338
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,320
I am not confused.

339
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,320
Young Master Jiang, Young Master,

340
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,320
Kun's army has gathered.

341
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
We are at your command.

342
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,320
Kill!

343
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
Kill!

344
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,320
Kill!

345
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,320
Brother Jiang,

346
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,320
the gate is broken too easily.

347
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,320
It's not just a blow.

348
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,320
There must be a trap.

349
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,320
The Central Plains is listening.

350
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,320
These rebels are murderers.

351
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,320
Oh, no.

352
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,320
We are trapped.

353
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,320
Dong Chun!

354
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,320
Look at my mouth.

355
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,320
I told you. There must be a trap.

356
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,320
You are finally here.

357
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,320
I have been waiting for you for a long time.

358
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,320
What?

359
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
Are you here to wait for us to kill you?

360
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
Jiang Wanhuan,

361
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,320
I

362
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,320
admire your

363
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320
arrogant and rebellious.

364
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,320
But you want to be my enemy.

365
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,320
Then

366
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,320
you blame me for not being talented.

367
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
You?

368
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,320
A old man who

369
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,320
used a weak woman to deceive the people

370
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
and still talks to me about being talented?

371
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,320
You are really a great opportunity.

372
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,320
I think

373
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
you should go to the real man

374
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,320
and see

375
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,320
what you are

376
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,320
doing to deceive the people.

377
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,320
You should be killed.

378
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
You think I am talking about

379
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
your words?

380
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,320
Can you make me angry?

381
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,320
What I did

382
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,320
is to obey the law.

383
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
The Central Plains

384
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
has been the state of the king.

385
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,320
If I hadn't been

386
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
so arrogant

387
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,320
and subdued the Qing Dynasty,

388
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,320
the heaven would have been responsible for it.

389
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,320
How could there be

390
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,320
the Central Plains today?

391
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,320
Nonsense.

392
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,320
Xuan Xuanji

393
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,320
poisoned the saint girl,

394
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,320
framed the loyal and loyal,

395
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,320
and subdued the king.

396
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,320
You ruined the Central Plains.

397
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,320
Today,

398
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,320
our Kun's army

399
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
will settle the score with you

400
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,320
and wipe out the evil

401
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,320
in the Central Plains.

402
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,320
It's you

403
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,320
who are still alive.

404
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,320
You are

405
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
the monsters

406
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,320
who should hide forever

407
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,320
in the place where the sun is not visible.

408
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,320
Jiang Wenhuan,

409
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
do you think

410
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,320
you can attack the Central Plains

411
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,320
with the defeated soldiers

412
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
of the Crown Prince and Kun's army?

413
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,320
After tonight,

414
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,320
not only you,

415
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,320
even the whole Central Plains

416
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,320
will be mine.

417
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
Brother Jiang,

418
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,320
it's time.

419
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,320
There is a back-up.

420
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,320
It's time to show it.

421
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,320
Zhongli Army, listen to my order.

422
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,320
The back-up is yours,

423
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,320
but not in my hands.

424
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,320
Taotie Army.

425
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
The King sent you here.

426
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
Master,

427
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,320
it's been a long time.

428
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,320
The music is getting better.

429
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,320
Lord Xuanji,

430
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
I played the music with you,

431
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,320
but you pulled the knife at me.

432
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,320
I'm afraid it's not right.

433
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,320
Lord Guoshi,

434
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,320
you sent the Tang's army to capture the silkworms.

435
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
I should be the emperor.

436
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,320
You are right.

437
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,320
The king is behind.

438
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,320
You are right.

439
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,320
It's not right to fight against Zhongli Army

440
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,320
with our people.

441
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,320
But I know

442
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,320
that you are the crown prince.

443
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,320
If we don't do well,

444
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,320
and pretend to be your king,

445
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,320
how can you

446
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,320
show your back?

447
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,320
According to the King's order,

448
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,320
the traitor Xuan Xuanji

449
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,320
killed the envoy

450
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,320
and framed the king.

451
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
He deserves to die.

452
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
Who dares?

453
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,320
I

454
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
have done a great favor to Shang Shan.

455
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
I

456
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,320
have a great respect

457
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,320
for the king.

458
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,320
But the king

459
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320
wants to give Zhong Liyuan

460
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,320
a false name, but he doesn't give me

461
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,320
the glory I deserve.

462
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,320
I

463
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
just want to get it back.

464
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,320
Xuan Xuanji,

465
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,320
as an envoy,

466
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
you have the ambition

467
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
that the king doesn't give you.

468
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
It's just a rebellion.

469
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,320
In fact,

470
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,320
you are the master of Zhongli

471
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,320
but you are

472
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,320
so arrogant

473
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,320
that you are the king's name.

474
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
You are so greedy.

475
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
Great.

476
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
Great.

477
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,320
The king is so ungrateful.

478
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,320
You are so arrogant.

479
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,320
But at the last moment,

480
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,320
I will not

481
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,320
give up.

482
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
No, Zhong Liyuan is in danger.

483
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,320
Master.

484
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,320
Master.

485
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,320
If you take another step,

486
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,320
I will kill him.

487
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
Xuan Xuanji,

488
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,320
you still want to make a mistake?

489
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,320
I am not wrong.

490
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,320
Compared with this useless person,

491
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,320
I am the savior of Zhongli.

492
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,320
I should be the master of Zhongli.

493
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
You still don't know the reason.

494
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,320
Seven years ago,

495
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,320
you poisoned the holy girl,

496
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,320
and killed Zhongliu.

497
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,320
Kun's family will never see the god in the underground city.

498
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
You even

499
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,320
took the king to the Su family

500
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,320
to hide the crime.

501
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,320
Now the crown prince is in the underground city,

502
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,320
he wants us to be together with Kun's family.

503
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,320
He wants us to be together with Kun's family.

504
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,320
He wants us to be together with Kun's family.

505
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,320
Xuan Xuanji,

506
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,320
you are a bad guy.

507
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,320
You should surrender.

508
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,320
Master.

509
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,320
Let me go.

510
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,320
I beg them.

511
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,320
I beg them to let you go.

512
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,320
I beg them to let you go.

513
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,320
Shut up.

514
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,320
You are so useless.

515
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,320
You don't deserve to beg me.

516
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,320
Jiang Wenhuan,

517
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,320
if you don't surrender,

518
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,320
don't blame me.

519
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,320
Kill this useless person.

520
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,320
You...

521
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,320
Master.

522
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,320
You are so useless.

523
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,320
You are so useless.

524
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,320
You are so useless.

525
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,320
I will kill you.

526
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,320
I will kill you.

527
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,320
You...

528
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,320
You...

529
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
You...

530
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,320
You...

531
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,320
You...

532
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,320
Protect the king.

533
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,320
Master.

534
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
Thanks for coming in time.

535
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,320
Otherwise,

536
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,320
I would have been dead.

537
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,320
It's good that you are fine.

538
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,320
Otherwise,

539
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,320
I really don't know how to explain to your brother.

540
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,320
Master.

541
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,320
The battlefield has been cleared.

542
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,320
We are going out of the city.

543
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,320
Out of the city?

544
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
The king of Zhongli is about to take over.

545
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
There are many things to do.

546
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,320
Why doesn't Lord Taotie sit in the city

547
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,320
and wait for Chen An to settle down?

548
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320
You are not a general.

549
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,320
You don't know the case.

550
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,320
It's our duty to judge.

551
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,320
But after the trial,

552
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,320
how can we intervene without the king's order?

553
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,320
According to the old order,

554
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,320
we will camp outside the city.

555
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,320
Don't worry about the old order.

556
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,320
Report to the king as soon as possible.

557
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,320
Is it a good idea to return to the court?

558
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,320
Soldiers,

559
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,320
I'll wait for you to take a position.

560
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,320
I'm leaving.

561
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,320
I heard that Lord Taotie

562
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,320
is good at fighting.

563
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,320
He is strict.

564
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,320
He is the most diligent.

565
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
How can he be so rude?

566
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
How dare he talk back to me?

567
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
I just want to take over Lord Taotie.

568
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,320
They are dissatisfied with me.

569
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,320
It's natural.

570
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,320
So,

571
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,320
you offended Tong Liao

572
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
to save us.

573
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,320
It's okay.

574
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,320
It's the most important

575
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,320
that you are fine.

576
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,320
You are hurt.

577
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,320
Master,

578
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,320
why did you bring

579
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,320
Anashi with you?

580
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,320
All these years,

581
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,320
when have you seen me not bring him?

582
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,320
That child,

583
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
he seems to be ignorant.

584
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,320
But I know

585
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,320
he knows better than anyone.

586
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,320
I really hope

587
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,320
that one day,

588
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,320
he can call me mother.

589
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,320
It will definitely happen.

590
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,320
This is the fire-sweeping talisman

591
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,320
that can kill the evil spirit and kill the evil spirit.

592
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,320
It's for India.

593
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,320
I hope it can control the poison in your body.

594
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,320
The doctor has prescribed the antidote for me.

595
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,320
Master, you don't have to worry too much.

596
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,320
How is the antidote?

597
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,320
There are still a few herbs left.

598
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,320
It should be able to be cured.

599
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,320
Good child.

600
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,320
Thanks to you.

601
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,320
I'll go make the antidote for my brother.

602
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,320
Go.

603
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,320
Huan'er, there is one thing

604
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,320
that I want to discuss with you.

605
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,320
What is it?

606
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,320
Since His Majesty has been looking for the antidote,

607
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,320
from Eastland to Zhongli,

608
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,320
there have been many troubles.

609
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,320
I'm very worried about your and the scholars' safety.

610
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,320
And now,

611
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,320
Zhongli is also

612
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,320
in a strange and strange state.

613
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,320
I'm thinking

614
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,320
that you should go back to Eastland first

615
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
and then make plans. What do you think?

616
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,320
But His Majesty is very kind to the Shizi Camp.

617
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,320
If he goes back without any success,

618
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,320
I'm afraid it's hard to explain.

619
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,320
If the capital is angry,

620
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
won't it let the Eastland and other states

621
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,320
suffer the same fate?

622
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,320
But...

623
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,320
It's okay. Now that the antidote is out,

624
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,320
Zhongli is safe.

625
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,320
His Majesty has been obsessed with the antidote for many years.

626
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,320
He has opened the Zhizi Camp.

627
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,320
If he can find the antidote,

628
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,320
he can beg His Majesty

629
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,320
to completely disband the Shizi Camp

630
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,320
and let everyone know about it.

631
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,320
But I always feel

632
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,320
that the so-called immortality medicine

633
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,320
is not that simple.

634
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
The heaven is born to be dust,

635
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,320
the yin and yang are not in harmony.

636
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,320
The little man is in trouble,

637
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,320
everything is in chaos.

638
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,320
Since Xing Xuan has died,

639
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,320
why is the state of Zhongli

640
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,320
not as good as the general?

641
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,320
Your Majesty, the master is here.

642
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,320
You're here.

643
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,320
I haven't had the chance

644
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,320
to look at you like this for a long time.

645
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,320
These years,

646
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,320
you've been so kind and kind.

647
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,320
I've been waiting for you.

648
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,320
I've been waiting for you.

649
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,320
You're so kind.

650
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,320
Tonight is the night of the Qing Palace.

651
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,320
Would you like to come with me?

652
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,320
I'm just a soldier.

653
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,320
I'm here to attend the banquet.

654
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,320
I don't like the atmosphere.

655
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,320
I don't care.

656
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,320
I want everyone to know

657
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,320
that the state of Zhongli can be like this.

658
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,320
You should be the one to take the credit.

659
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,320
The night of the restoration of the state is not a credit.

660
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,320
How can I forget?

661
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,320
But...

662
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,320
Your Majesty,

663
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,320
I don't care about those empty words.

664
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,320
What I did

665
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,320
is just a matter of

666
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,320
showing the people of Zhongli.

667
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,320
You're the master of a country.

668
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,320
I'm just a flying fish

669
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,320
that flies to the sky.

670
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,320
We've been living in the sky for seven years.

671
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,320
Now that the state has been redeemed,

672
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,320
everything has returned to normal.

673
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,320
As a person of Zhongli,

674
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,320
I should stay at the war station tonight

675
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,320
and pray for the state of Zhongli.

676
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,320
Okay.

677
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,320
What you don't want to do,

678
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,320
I will never force you.

679
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

680
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,320
The earth is dust,

681
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,320
the sky is not clear.

682
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,320
The little man is lost,

683
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,320
everything is in chaos.

684
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,320
What does this mean?

685
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,740
Gonna rout in sana to beat ya

686
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,540
Go die

687
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,540
We fight the entrepreneurship

688
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,340
each our Butterfly

689
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,340
Go die

690
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,340
Go die

691
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,340
Go die

692
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,860
I met the great need

693
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,860
butίν

694
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:02,900
and why

695
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:39,500
I'm afraid the wind would foundation this life

696
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:45,200
I'mä am You
