1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Even if we are separated by fate, we will never stop loving each other.

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,600
We will never give up our hearts to each other.

3
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,400
We will always be together until the end.

4
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,000
Until our fates are finally revealed.

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We will never stop.

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Episode 15

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Brother Jiang!

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You're finally back. Something happened.

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,400
What's wrong?

10
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,600
E-Shun and Xiao Cheng, you are all gone.

11
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,000
I waited for a whole day but I couldn't find them.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,200
Do you think they were caught?

13
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
No need to look for them.

14
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,200
What do you mean no need to look for them?

15
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,800
Did you already pick them up?

16
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,600
Then where did they go?

17
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,600
They should have left the city by now.

18
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,600
Left the city? Where did they go?

19
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,200
Then... did they come back?

20
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,200
They are all brothers of the same group.

21
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,400
Even though they are not E-Shun,

22
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,600
they are still friends.

23
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,000
They left without saying a word.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,600
Since they are not E-Shun,

25
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,400
what's the difference between saying it and not saying it?

26
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,000
Brother Jiang, are you really ready to never see them again?

27
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,200
No matter what,

28
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,800
this is the best choice for the Crown Prince and him.

29
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,800
The best choice?

30
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,200
The Crown Prince of South Capital is missing.

31
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,800
How are you going to explain it to His Majesty?

32
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,000
In the future, I will think of a way to explain it to him.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I won't drag him down.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,800
Is it really a drag now?

35
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
No, Brother Jiang,

36
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,000
when did you start doing things without thinking?

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,400
Why are you like me now?

38
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,400
Like you, what's wrong?

39
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,600
That's right.

40
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,200
After a day, it's a day.

41
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,800
At least everyone is still alive.

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,400
What about you?

43
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,000
Are you going to work hard

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,200
to protect the motherland and fight the war?

45
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,600
Or...

46
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,000
I want to...

47
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,200
live on.

48
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,800
That's right.

49
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,400
It's good to be alive.

50
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,800
I understand.

51
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,400
Even if They Berg were gone,

52
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,200
what about Longevity Immortal?

53
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
We've been waiting for a long time, yet there isn't any clue.

54
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,200
How can we find these things?

55
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,400
Since they won't give us any clues,

56
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,200
we have to look for them.

57
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
So many.

58
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:47,420
Why the

59
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,780
after a short illness

60
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,360
has been affected

61
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,040
The ancient tomb of the legendary

62
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,920
Immortal Zhongli

63
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,080
is hidden in the ancient tomb.

64
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,160
Why are you here?

65
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,520
I've been waiting for you.

66
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,240
Where are you taking me?

67
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,680
3 seconds ago

68
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,160
F será-o de 의�.

69
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,600
What is this?

70
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,320
A bucket of black water that can quench a terrible세요.

71
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,720
You're mining the Zhongli Palace online.

72
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,040
You have something on your mind.

73
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,360
You want to solve it Till your heartす good.

74
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,960
Only a whole bucket of water

75
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,640
could quench my suspentions.

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,120
a picture can change your fate with for this bottle of water

77
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,360
You'll know when you try it.

78
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:49,200
territory of the millimeter

79
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,800
What does this mean

80
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,920
The answer we want in our mind

81
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,700
the Korean hits, Juche Regardless of the Ghats

82
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,500
If there's no wall you still look sore

83
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,500
is in the north.

84
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:54,900
North?

85
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,100
The north of Zhongli?

86
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,700
Where is it?

87
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Mount Qingluan.

88
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,900
The Mount Qingluan of Zhongli State?

89
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,700
Mount Qingluan?

90
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,700
You know this place, Mr. Jiang?

91
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,500
Since I've been visiting Zhongli Palace late at night,

92
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,700
I can't come for nothing.

93
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,900
So as the real man said,

94
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,500
the medicine of Immortal Immortality

95
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,300
might be in Mount Qingluan.

96
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,300
I don't know if there's a medicine of Immortality in Mount Qingluan.

97
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,900
I only know that from the Black Water Pool,

98
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
there are a thousand mysteries in Mount Qingluan.

99
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,900
I'm waiting for you to solve them.

100
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,100
May I ask,

101
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,700
do you know the ancient tomb of Yousu?

102
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,500
It's said that the ancient tomb of Yousu

103
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,700
is the tomb of the ancestors of the Su family.

104
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,100
I'm not sure about the rest.

105
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,700
In that case,

106
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,900
I'm grateful for your advice.

107
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,300
But there's one thing I don't understand.

108
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,700
You're a state preceptor.

109
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,500
Why did you tell me the clues of the longevity medicine?

110
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,500
Aren't you afraid that the state preceptor will blame you?

111
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,100
You've got the answer you want, right?

112
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,500
Then who am I to you?

113
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,100
Is it important to you?

114
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,700
You're right.

115
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,900
I have nothing to do with your purpose.

116
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,300
But we both have the same answer.

117
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,500
By the way,

118
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,100
when you saved me in Qiongxiang,

119
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,100
did you say something to me?

120
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,500
I said,

121
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,100
you're my destiny.

122
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,900
Destiny?

123
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,700
What's destiny?

124
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,100
I don't know.

125
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,500
I hope you can answer for me in the future.

126
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,100
Goodbye.

127
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,300
And your destiny,

128
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,900
can it be changed?

129
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,900
You shouldn't have said so much to him.

130
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,100
You used the longevity medicine to lure him to the ancient tomb of Yousu.

131
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,700
That place is a dangerous place.

132
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,500
If you have the chance, you can go there.

133
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,300
You can't do the trick.

134
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,300
I should do it.

135
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,900
You should know that

136
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,700
destiny can't be changed.

137
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,900
But no matter what,

138
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,500
Jiang Wenhuan must go there.

139
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,900
Right?

140
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,100
Useless!

141
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
I told you to keep an eye on Jiang Wenhuan.

142
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,900
But he found Qingluan Mountain.

143
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,500
You can't do this.

144
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,300
I don't want you to be in danger.

145
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,300
Your Majesty, Qingluan Mountain is my forbidden place.

146
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,700
It's been surrounded for years.

147
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,300
People don't know the cause and effect of it.

148
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,500
I don't know how Jiang Wenhuan found it.

149
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,100
If he found Qingluan Mountain,

150
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,300
it doesn't matter.

151
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,500
The Su clan is not so famous now.

152
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,900
But how did he know the ancient tomb of Yousu?

153
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,900
Did someone leak the secret?

154
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,500
I took him there to find it.

155
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,700
Yousu Ancient Tomb?

156
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Good.

157
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,700
Since they insist on going there,

158
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,300
I won't stop them.

159
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,500
They are not living.

160
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,300
They are looking for death.

161
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,300
Tell Gu Xi to come to Xuanji Palace.

162
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,100
I want him to take these brats

163
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,900
to find the medicine.

164
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,700
You mean if the Crown Prince Camp is in danger,

165
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,700
it's hard to tell the mountain.

166
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,300
Jiang Wenhuan tried his best to take the medicine.

167
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,900
He acted without permission.

168
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,500
So the Crown Prince Camp was in danger.

169
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,300
He and the Crown Prince were in danger.

170
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,700
I tried my best to stop them.

171
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,300
But I still can't save them.

172
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,100
Tell me.

173
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,100
What does it have to do with me being separated?

174
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,700
Yes.

175
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,500
I'll ask the witness to arrange it.

176
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,100
Qingluan Mountain?

177
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,900
Where is Qingluan Mountain?

178
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,300
Is it in Zhongli?

179
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:51,300
Qingluan Mountain was in Zhongli many years ago.

180
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,900
It's normal that you forgot it.

181
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,100
Then I have to go there with you?

182
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,300
Qingluan Mountain is complicated.

183
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,300
Yousu Ancient Tomb is hard to find.

184
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,100
If you don't find it, you'll get lost.

185
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,700
Gu Xi is a good witness.

186
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,700
I'm relieved to have him.

187
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,700
Okay.

188
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,900
Then it's up to you.

189
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:30,100
Qingluan Mountain is a dangerous place in Zhongli.

190
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,100
If you're in danger,

191
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,700
tell Gu Xi to go there with you.

192
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,500
I'm glad to hear that.

193
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,500
I'm glad to hear that.

194
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,300
You've received the goodwill of the State Preceptor.

195
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,500
We'll find the longevity fairy pill for His Majesty.

196
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,700
I hope you can go back and forth.

197
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,100
Of course.

198
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,900
I can't accept any of them.

199
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,900
If we go further, we'll reach Zhongli.

200
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,900
I wanted to leave here before.

201
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,300
But now I really want to leave.

202
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,900
I'm reluctant to leave.

203
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,700
But as long as I'm with you,

204
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,500
I can go anywhere.

205
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,900
But you seem to be more reluctant than me.

206
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,700
I'm more reluctant than Qingqing.

207
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,700
It's useless.

208
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,700
Did you hear that the people from Shangshan went to Qingluan Mountain?

209
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,700
Yes.

210
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,700
Xu San's uncle is on duty in the palace.

211
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,500
I heard that the Crown Prince Camp is going to find the pill.

212
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,300
Find the pill?

213
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,100
No one has been in and out of Qingluan Mountain for a long time.

214
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,300
What kind of pill did they find in the wilderness?

215
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,300
Who knows?

216
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,500
These people from Shangshan are bold.

217
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,700
They seem to go to the ancient tomb.

218
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,900
Ancient tomb?

219
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,700
Could it be that Xuanji...

220
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,300
Don't mention these old things.

221
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,700
It's bad luck.

222
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,300
The Crown Prince Camp went to Qingluan Mountain.

223
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,100
Could it be for the sake of the immortals?

224
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:31,520
The

225
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,100
Qingqing, what's wrong?

226
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,700
As far as I know,

227
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,100
there is only one ancient tomb in Qingluan Mountain.

228
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,900
That's the Yosu Tomb.

229
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,300
Now, Mr. Jiang and the others

230
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,500
go there most of the time.

231
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,500
The tomb is the tomb of the Yosu Immortal.

232
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,500
Why didn't my mother take us to the temple when we were children?

233
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,900
I only remember that my mother said that

234
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,100
the Yosu Tomb is interesting and has no regrets.

235
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,300
Forget it.

236
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,700
Although the little Goddess looks good,

237
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,700
she has a strange sense of purpose.

238
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,700
That State Preceptor didn't have any good intentions at first sight.

239
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,700
It seems that the Goddess is our guide.

240
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,100
Isn't she just watching us?

241
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,500
They have been talking for a long time.

242
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,900
What are they talking about?

243
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,700
You want to know your own question?

244
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,300
If you tried to tell us,

245
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,700
you could have said you're willing to accept your mother's request.

246
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,340
Sister-in-law,

247
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,300
there's shredded mustard juice in the sesame folks.

248
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,700
It's paper's back so no one can smell stream on it.

249
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,700
The mountain Peony came closer,

250
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,900
so it's hard to find someone to fix it.

251
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,300
Your mother bought her smooth methodology

252
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,700
to strengthen her spirit.

253
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,800
I heard that

254
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,520
to find a place to hide Wen Tuo.

255
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,960
If I don't come back in a day,

256
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,360
you should leave Zhongli

257
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,240
and don't come to me.

258
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,160
No.

259
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,360
I want to go to the mountain with you.

260
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,360
Qingqing,

261
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,560
it's hard to predict your intentions.

262
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,320
And you have nothing to do with Jiang Xiong.

263
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,800
You don't need to take the risk with me.

264
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,200
How can I have nothing to do with you?

265
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,840
My life is saved by Mr. Jiang.

266
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,120
Besides,

267
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,280
there are ancient tombstones.

268
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,720
Even my mother said it's dangerous.

269
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,680
It's not a good place to go.

270
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,720
If Mr. Jiang and his family go there,

271
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,000
if there's an accident,

272
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,800
I will regret it for the rest of my life.

273
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,840
But Qingqing...

274
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,600
Don't say that.

275
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
There are ancient tombstones. It's very secretive.

276
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,160
Ordinary people in Zhongli don't know about it.

277
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,080
If someone said that Mr. Jiang knew about it,

278
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,760
if someone didn't try to trick us,

279
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,120
I would never believe it.

280
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,400
As for those who tried to trick us,

281
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
what are their intentions?

282
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,880
We have to be careful.

283
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,760
We should remind Mr. Jiang to be careful.

284
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,840
Let's go.

285
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,120
Qingqing,

286
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,480
it's too dangerous.

287
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,760
You can't go.

288
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,400
I will go wherever you go.

289
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,640
Besides,

290
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:06,000
you are the one who worries about Mr. Jiang the most.

291
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,400
I...

292
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,720
I'm worried about the people of the Shizi Camp.

293
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,960
After all,

294
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,360
I lied to them.

295
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:15,800
Qingqing.

296
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Yes.

297
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,320
Even if you are worried about the people of the Shizi Camp,

298
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,960
I will go with you.

299
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,920
Okay.

300
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,040
You follow me.

301
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,840
I can rest assured.

302
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,400
How far is it?

303
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,240
Brother Jiang.

304
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,440
This forest is covered with the sun and the moon.

305
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,400
We are tired.

306
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,720
We should rest here.

307
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,360
Let's go tomorrow.

308
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,880
This is a low place.

309
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,400
It's a wet land.

310
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,320
The low ground is full of gas.

311
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,560
We need to find a flat place

312
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,120
to dry up.

313
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,760
Look at the condition of the people.

314
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,480
Oh!

315
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,440
ItTw stitches!

Apply some ointment.

321
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,280
What's wrong?

322
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,240
Sometimes,

323
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,400
it can make you a little drowsy.

324
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,160
Get up.

325
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,120
Rest.

326
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,640
Xingzhang,

327
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,120
go to find the master of the camp with me.

328
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,480
Brother Xiang,

329
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,800
I can't do it anymore.

330
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,960
Find someone else this time.

331
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,720
Useless.

332
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,200
Who said that?

333
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,000
Say it again.

334
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,640
I said say it again.

335
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,920
Mr. Jiang,

336
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,640
I'll go with you.

337
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,720
When someone like you

338
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,440
hasThat's right in his eyes,

339
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,760
I want to hear that from him,

340
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,960
but I think

341
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,280
this is not what I said before.

342
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,360
When someone like you

343
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,360
hasThat's right in his eyes,

344
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,800
I want to hear that from him,

345
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,600
but I think

346
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,200
this is not what I said before.

347
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,040
Thank you.

348
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,640
I've never been here.

349
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,840
I'm just taking the road.

350
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,440
Drink some water.

351
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,640
Okay.

352
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,440
Why isn't anyone here?

353
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,240
We are all tired.

354
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,040
Besides, Jiang Xiong will be back soon.

355
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,440
What's that?

356
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,440
Everyone, be careful!

357
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,040
What's wrong?

358
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,440
What's wrong?

359
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,440
Nothing.

360
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,440
This place is good.

361
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,440
We shouldn't go any further.

362
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,440
Make a mark and bring them here.

363
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,440
Okay.

364
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,440
No.

365
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,440
Why not?

366
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,440
We can only move forward.

367
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,440
We can't turn back.

368
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,440
What do you mean?

369
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,440
Turn around and look.

370
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,440
What's wrong?

371
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,440
What's wrong?

372
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,440
What's wrong?

373
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,440
What's wrong?

374
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,440
What's wrong?

375
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,440
What's wrong?

376
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,440
What's wrong?

377
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,440
What's wrong?

378
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,440
What's wrong?

379
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,440
What's wrong?

380
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,440
What's wrong?

381
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,440
What's your problem?

382
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,440
Sir, are you all right?

383
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,440
Yes.

384
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,440
Can I see you again?

385
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,440
Yes.

386
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,440
Help!

387
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,440
Don't cause any trouble.

388
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,440
buatng boil?

389
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:30,240
F

390
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,440
The royal toast!

391
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,440
It had rare."

392
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,280
W Contact

393
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,280
Why don't you try it?

394
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,280
Check everything.

395
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,560
Go to the infirmary to try it.

396
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,440
Yes.

397
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,600
Brother, look.

398
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,280
Go to the infirmary to try it.

399
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,880
Yes.

400
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,360
Go.

401
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,960
This time, we must make Jiang Wenhuan

402
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,840
go to the infirmary.

403
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,200
Yi Yao.

404
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,800
Sister Yi Yao.

405
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,760
Wake up, sister Yi Yao.

406
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,560
Brother, what is this?

407
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,200
It's a kind of sedative.

408
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,120
How to use it?

409
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,120
Let her smell it.

410
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,200
Okay.

411
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,120
Yi Yao.

412
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,000
Sister Yi Yao.

413
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,400
Are you okay?

414
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,120
Don't worry.

415
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,320
I'll wake them up.

416
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,680
You're still poisoned.

417
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,680
Don't move.

418
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,640
Where is Brother Jiang?

419
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,160
Where is Xinzha?

420
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,920
Go to find the place where Jia Ying is.

421
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,200
By the way,

422
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,480
we encountered the gas.

423
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,800
Then we fainted.

424
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,360
Gas.

425
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,360
That's not gas.

426
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,080
It's poison.

427
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,840
Answer me first.

428
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
Which direction did they go?

429
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,400
That direction.

430
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,520
Sister Yi Yao.

431
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,040
Their target is Brother Jiang.

432
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,200
I don't think they'll come back for now.

433
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,320
It's just that I...

434
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,440
My friend

435
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,200
is entrusted to you.

436
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,640
Brother Jiang is in danger.

437
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,520
I'll go save him first.

438
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,640
Get up.

439
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,040
Slow down.

440
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,280
Why is this building shaking?

441
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,800
Are we almost there?

442
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:26,720
Brother Jiang.

443
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,040
Look.

444
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,320
That's right.

445
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,480
This is the ancient tomb of You Su.

446
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,960
It's said that this place was buried in the year of Sheng An.

447
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,960
It's a part of the You Su ancestors who have been in the army for a long time.

448
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,200
It seems that you are destined to be with the You Su clan.

449
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,200
You actually found this place so quickly.

450
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,040
It's really a blessing from heaven.

451
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,200
A blessing?

452
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,920
Isn't it the real person

453
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,960
and the few good men hidden in the forest

454
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,480
who brought the lanterns here?

455
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,880
Good men?

456
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,400
There are other people here?

457
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,360
Get out of here.

458
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,560
I should know that

459
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,080
they didn't

460
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,240
kill me.

461
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,760
What's going on?

462
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,560
Brother.

463
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,280
It seems that

464
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,040
we have no way out today.

465
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,480
Since you understand,

466
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,280
please.

467
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:54,920
Sesion V – the

468
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,720
Xiaowan Если

469
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,520
is true.

470
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,880
This man

471
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,160
is aactive.

472
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,120
Are you running away?

473
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,760
Why are you here alone?

474
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:18,880
The

475
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,320
acons want to harm us,

476
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,320
but they dare not female come out.

477
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,240
You prohibit

478
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,880
us to do what you want.

479
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,320
Before we set off

480
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,600
I've made a bet with you three

481
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,360
The bet is

482
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,280
you die first and then come back to life

483
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,640
Jiang Menghuan

484
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,280
If you can come out alive this time

485
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,640
I believe you will change one day

486
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,160
Your Majesty

487
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,560
I've brought Jiang Menghuan and the others

488
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,560
to the underground city

489
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,960
The rest of the scholars

490
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,560
will follow your orders

491
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,960
and kill them

492
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,760
You must have some questions

493
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,360
when you came here

494
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,560
Please give me some advice

495
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,160
Do you blame me

496
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,760
for not caring about you

497
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,760
when you were in danger?

498
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,160
If I can't risk my life

499
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,160
how can I lure Jiang Menghuan and the others

500
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,560
to the palace?

501
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,560
I understand

502
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,560
You are always calm

503
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,160
and clear-minded

504
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,160
I didn't see it wrong

505
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,360
But

506
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,360
I have another thing to tell you

507
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,360
What is it?

508
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,160
Can the things in the underground city

509
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,560
really trap Jiang Menghuan and the others?

510
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,760
Have you heard of

511
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,760
the ancient tomb of Yousu?

512
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,760
It's interesting

513
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,760
What is the power

514
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,760
of the things

515
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,760
in the underground city of Yousu?

516
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,760
We can wait and see

517
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,760
Brother Jiang

518
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,760
Where are we?

519
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,760
It turns out

520
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,360
that this place

521
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,360
is the place

522
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,360
that the fruit master

523
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,360
really wants us to come

524
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,360
How do we go now?

525
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,360
Let's go this way

526
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,360
It's noisy

527
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,360
Wait a minute

528
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,360
I'm afraid of the dark

529
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,360
Wait

530
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,360
Did you hear anything?

531
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,360
What sound?

532
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,360
No sound

533
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,360
What's wrong?

534
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,360
I heard something

535
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,360
You noticed something wrong?

536
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,360
The sound is low

537
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,360
It's the world of Yuan

538
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,360
No, Brother Chuang

539
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,360
Don't scare me

540
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,360
It will scare people

541
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,360
Stop

542
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,360
I heard it

543
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,360
No, Brother Chuang

544
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,360
What is this sound?

545
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,360
I don't know what it is

546
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,360
But I'm sure

547
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,360
It must not be a good thing

548
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,360
There is something

549
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,360
Let's go

550
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,360
Go and have a look

551
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,360
Is this the place of Yousu?

552
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,360
Go

553
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,360
You scared me

554
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,360
What is this?

555
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,360
Is this the sword of Kun's family?

556
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,360
Kun's family

557
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,360
It's Kunwu's army

558
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,360
Brother Chuang, be careful

559
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,360
It's Kunwu's army

560
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,360
Is this Kun's army?

561
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,360
Good

562
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,360
Is this?

563
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,360
Good

564
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,360
Is this Kun's army?

565
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,360
It's you

566
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,600
Waiting for him

567
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,960
What are you doing?

568
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,040
Uncle Lin

569
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,600
Is it you?

570
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,600
Young Master!

571
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,600
Young Master!

572
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,600
Uncle Li, I hit it!

573
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,600
Good. You're not the future master of our Kun Army.

574
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,600
Tell me, Uncle Li. What do you want?

575
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,600
I want to see Kun Family's strong formation.

576
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
Good. All soldiers, listen to my order.

577
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,600
Yes.

578
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,600
Form the formation.

579
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,600
Once this formation is laid out,

580
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,600
it means our Kun Army has already taken the risk of life and death.

581
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,600
We must fight against the thousand-arm army

582
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,600
with our weak body.

583
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,600
We must protect Zhongli and our Kun Family.

584
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,600
When I grow up, I want to go to the battlefield with my uncles.

585
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,600
Protect Zhongli and our Kun Family!

586
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,600
Young Master!

587
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,600
Young Master!

588
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,600
It's really you.

589
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,600
They are my old friends from Kun Family.

590
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,600
Young Master!

591
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,600
Young Master!

592
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:20,600
The End
