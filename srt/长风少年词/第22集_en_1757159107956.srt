1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Even if we are separated by fate, we will never stop loving each other.

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,600
We will never give up on our hearts.

3
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,400
We will only fight for the end in our hearts.

4
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,000
Until our fates are finally revealed, we will never stop.

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Episode 15

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Brother Chong.

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,600
What is it?

8
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,600
The knife you stabbed me with hurts so much.

9
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,600
Why are you here?

10
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,200
No.

11
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,600
I didn't do it on purpose.

12
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,600
I didn't do it on purpose.

13
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,000
I didn't do it on purpose.

14
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,200
I really didn't do it on purpose.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You rascal.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Mei Ran!

17
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,000
It's my fault.

18
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,600
It's my fault.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,200
It's my fault.

20
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,200
It's my fault.

21
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,400
Jiang Wu Huan.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,800
Jiang Wu Huan.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,800
Get up.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,800
Help.

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,200
Xing Jia.

26
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,200
Xing Jia.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,800
Brother Chong.

28
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Xing Jia.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,800
No.

30
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,200
Brother Chong.

31
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,800
No.

32
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,200
Brother Chong.

33
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,600
No.

34
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,200
Brother Chong.

35
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,200
Brother Chong.

36
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,600
Brother Chong.

37
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,600
Brother Jiang.

38
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,600
What are you doing?

39
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,200
A Yan.

40
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,000
A Shun.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,800
A Shun.

42
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,600
A Yan.

43
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,000
Da Huang.

44
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,600
Da Huang.

45
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,400
Brother Jiang.

46
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,600
What happened just now?

47
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
It feels like it's real.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,200
There's something strange here.

49
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,200
We'd better leave here quickly.

50
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,800
It's not about this place.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,800
Otherwise,

52
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,000
why didn't I and the guards

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
get the magical powers?

54
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,800
Then what's going on?

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,200
When we got the magical powers,

56
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,200
there was a drum sound.

57
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,600
The hand drum of Granny Su.

58
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,600
It must be

59
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
the magical powers

60
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
that were used by the drum sound.

61
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,600
It means that Granny Su

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,600
must be the successor of the Saint Maiden.

63
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,600
That drum sound is a magical power.

64
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,000
What did the little hand drum do?

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,800
It's so powerful.

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It seems that

67
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,000
there's something wrong with the car.

68
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
Do you remember

69
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,800
the situation before we set off?

70
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,200
Young Master.

71
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,400
Aren't you looking for someone?

72
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,200
God knows where he is.

73
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
Then let's go quickly.

74
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,000
Wait.

75
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,800
Something is strange.

76
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,600
We've lost him.

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,800
You just gave us some clues.

78
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
You're still so cautious.

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What's your good idea?

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Tell us.

81
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,200
I've caught three ghosts and six demons today.

82
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,400
They're all evil.

83
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,800
So if we act rashly,

84
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,600
we'll be caught and be in trouble.

85
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
You're so stubborn.

86
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,000
But I never wake up.

87
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Please take us to the mountain quickly.

88
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,600
Even if there's a little clue,

89
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,600
it's better than sitting here and crying.

90
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,200
You follow them secretly.

91
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,000
You can't let them go.

92
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
The ancient magic

93
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,200
has a sound.

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,600
What's the secret behind it?

95
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,600
Do you know?

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,800
Since we were ordered to find the medicine,

97
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,800
there's always a feeling of unease.

98
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,400
It seems that everything

99
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,000
from the East Road to Zhongli

100
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
is clearly connected.

101
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,400
For example, the ancient magic valley and the Ghost Clan.

102
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Don't worry.

103
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,200
The Saintess's life

104
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,000
shouldn't be decided here.

105
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,800
Look over there.

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,400
That's Qingluan Mountain.

107
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,200
Yin Yang Cave is nearby.

108
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,800
Let's go.

109
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,800
Miss, wake up.

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,800
Don't sleep.

111
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
Everyone, wake up.

112
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,400
Don't sleep.

113
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,400
Wake up.

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Wake up.

115
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Wake up.

116
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,800
Don't come forward.

117
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
Don't come forward.

118
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,440
Don't come forward.

119
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,800
Hurry up and get up.

120
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,000
Come on.

121
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,200
Yeah.

122
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,800
Wake up.

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,760
Wake up.

124
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,400
Wake up.

125
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,200
Wake up.

126
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,600
Wake up.

127
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Qingqing, I'm sorry.

128
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,320
You're awake.

129
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,240
I wanted to give you to His Majesty,

130
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,240
but now,

131
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,240
there's no need for that.

132
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,240
Qingqing, do you remember

133
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,240
the fate of the Saintess of the Yousu Clan?

134
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,240
I remember.

135
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,240
The Saintess of the Yousu Clan,

136
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,240
the Saintess of the Yousu Clan,

137
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,240
should be changed to protect the peace of Zhongli.

138
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,240
If you can't protect yourself,

139
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,240
what should you do?

140
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,240
If I can't protect myself,

141
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,240
I should be burned to ashes

142
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,240
and be buried in the ground.

143
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,240
Could it be...

144
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
this mask?

145
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,240
The punishment has been imposed.

146
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,240
The Saintess is the beauty.

147
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,240
Let me go!

148
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,240
Let me go!

149
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,240
Bear with it, little Saintess!

150
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,240
No one knows about this place.

151
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,240
You can't escape.

152
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
You...

153
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,240
You...

154
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,240
You...

155
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,240
You...

156
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
The Saintess's fate

157
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,240
is to be the eyes of the Divine Valley.

158
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
The Divine Valley can be made,

159
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,240
and the Great Night can be made.

160
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,240
Don't run, little Saintess!

161
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,240
Qingqing!

162
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,240
There are... there are people from the tribe inside.

163
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
Okay.

164
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,240
What's wrong with your tribe?

165
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,240
They are possessed by the illusion.

166
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,240
The inner valley...

167
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
The inner valley is in trouble.

168
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,240
Today, I'll use your inner valley!

169
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,240
You can't let him see!

170
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
This valley looks good.

171
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,220
Where is the

172
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
Are you okay?

173
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,240
Shoujun!

174
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
The Saintess!

175
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
Send those women to the mountain to help the King.

176
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,240
We must ask the doctor to cure them.

177
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
The Saintess!

178
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,240
I want to go with them.

179
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,240
I'm really worried.

180
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,240
Maybe they are

181
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,240
my last people.

182
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,240
Be careful.

183
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,240
Take care of the Saintess.

184
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
Yes.

185
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
Then...

186
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
Don't worry.

187
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
The mountain is clear.

188
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,240
Let's go.

189
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,240
Today,

190
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,240
we'll make this mysterious place

191
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,240
clear.

192
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,240
Check it.

193
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,240
The inner valley is made by human's scalp.

194
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,240
And it's all women.

195
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,240
There's a missing one.

196
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,240
It's the size of a scalp.

197
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
I don't know why it's not complete.

198
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,240
The size of the head was peeled off.

199
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,240
It's very similar to the

200
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,240
clues in the underground city.

201
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,240
The head is very small.

202
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
The head is very small.

203
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
The head is very small.

204
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,240
The head is very small.

205
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,240
The head is very small.

206
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,240
The head is very small.

207
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,240
The head is very small.

208
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,240
But we don't know

209
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,240
the relationship.

210
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,240
So

211
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,240
it's very likely

212
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,240
to be related to the Celestial Immortals.

213
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,240
And

214
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,240
that person is from the Ghost House.

215
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,240
Ghost House?

216
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,240
It's the Ghost House again.

217
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,240
Ghost House?

218
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,240
I don't know.

219
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,240
All the way here, from the Eastland to the Central Plains,

220
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,440
every

221
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,240
barricade

222
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,240
has the sound of the Ghost House.

223
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,240
I see.

224
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,240
But why do they

225
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,240
need to know this?

226
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,240
I think

227
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,240
it's very likely

228
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,240
to be related to the purpose of us coming to the Central Plains.

229
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,240
Celestial Immortals?

230
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,240
Do you have

231
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,240
any findings?

232
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,240
Come with me.

233
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,240
Look here.

234
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,240
This is a mechanism?

235
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,240
Let's not try it.

236
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,240
Since

237
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,240
the Celestial Immortals are related to the Celestial Immortals,

238
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,240
then what's hidden in this chamber

239
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,240
is the secret of the Celestial Immortals?

240
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,240
What are you waiting for?

241
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,240
Go and take a look.

242
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,240
Let's go.

243
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,240
Brother Jiang,

244
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,240
look at this.

245
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,240
Look at the surface.

246
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,240
Does it look like the skin of a wounded man?

247
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,240
Could this be...

248
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,240
That's right.

249
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,560
This is the source of the

250
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,560
Look.

251
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,560
This person has a set of

252
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,560
fake ashes.

253
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,560
It's a fake ashes.

254
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,240
There's a picture here too.

255
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,240
Have you seen this before?

256
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,240
These pictures,

257
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,240
what does it have to do with the Celestial Immortals?

258
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,240
What's wrong?

259
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,240
I think I know.

260
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,240
I want to know

261
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,240
why Uncle Lin and the others have become like this.

262
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,240
What is it?

263
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,240
Look.

264
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,240
The mark on your heart.

265
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,240
The eternal pain.

266
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,240
It's the Celestial Immortals' medicine?

267
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,240
That's right.

268
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,240
You said the Celestial Immortals' medicine

269
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,240
is a lie.

270
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,240
That's right, Brother Jiang.

271
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,240
You can't talk nonsense.

272
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,240
According to the painting,

273
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,240
the Nine-tailed Fox gave the Celestial Immortals' medicine to the Celestial Immortals.

274
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,240
The Celestial Immortals gave the medicine

275
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
to a mysterious family.

276
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,240
It's the Celestial Immortals' family from Yousu.

277
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,240
So the Ghost Wind took the escape from the Yousu people

278
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,240
to stop it.

279
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,240
It must be for the Celestial Immortals' medicine.

280
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,240
Everything is connected here.

281
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,240
No.

282
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,240
It's said that the Celestial Immortals' medicine

283
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,240
is the only way to unify the country.

284
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,240
If the Celestial Immortals' medicine is problematic,

285
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,240
how could it be...

286
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,240
It's to turn those who are alive

287
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,240
into living people.

288
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,240
Only in this way

289
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,240
can we establish a army

290
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
that won't be injured or die.

291
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,240
A army that won't be in danger

292
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,240
in the afternoon.

293
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,240
A army that won't be injured or die.

294
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,240
This army

295
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,240
is the real invincible.

296
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,240
It's better to live than to die.

297
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,240
This is what we call

298
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,240
the Celestial Immortals' medicine.

299
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,240
It's not the Celestial Immortals' medicine.

300
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,240
It's obviously a lie

301
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,240
that someone who doesn't have any intention

302
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,240
used to make war.

303
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,240
Who is it?

304
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,240
Catch her!

305
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,240
Bring her here.

306
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,240
Bring her here.

307
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,240
Granny Su?

308
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,240
Brother Shoujun.

309
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,240
What's wrong with this granny?

310
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,240
Why are you treating her like this?

311
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,240
Miss Su, you don't know.

312
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,240
Today, this granny is pretending to be a ghost.

313
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,240
She almost killed the Crown Prince.

314
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,240
Su?

315
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,240
Su?

316
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,240
Your surname is Su?

317
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,240
What's your name?

318
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,240
My surname is Su.

319
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,240
My name is Qingqing.

320
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,240
Qingqing?

321
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,240
You are Qingqing?

322
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
You are Xiao Ying's daughter, Qingqing?

323
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,240
Heaven is far away.

324
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,240
We have a Su clan.

325
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,240
We have a Su clan.

326
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
We have no ancestors.

327
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,240
Granny Su,

328
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,240
do you not know that Qingqing is still alive?

329
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,240
Back then,

330
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,240
those people from the other clans

331
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,240
were so cruel

332
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,240
to the common people of the other clans.

333
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,240
You and Kunwu

334
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,240
as the descendant of the Saintess,

335
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,240
were so naive and naive.

336
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,240
I thought,

337
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,240
how could I escape

338
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,240
their hands?

339
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,240
Later,

340
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,240
I accidentally

341
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,240
went to the other clans

342
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,240
and heard

343
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,240
that the King of Zhongli

344
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,240
would sacrifice you.

345
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,240
Someone

346
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,240
wanted the Saintess's skin

347
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,240
but it was the Valley of Gods.

348
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,240
I knew that you were still alive.

349
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
I tried my best

350
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,240
to escape from the village.

351
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,240
I wanted to find you.

352
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,240
It's okay, Granny.

353
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,240
But

354
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,240
what did you just say?

355
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,240
What kind of magical power

356
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,240
does the Valley of Gods have?

357
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,240
The Valley of Gods?

358
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
Yes.

359
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
What's that sound?

360
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,240
Someone is coming.

361
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,240
What's wrong, Granny?

362
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,240
What's wrong?

363
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,240
Hurry,

364
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,240
go into the Lulidang with them.

365
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,240
Is someone coming, Granny?

366
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,240
Listen to me. Hurry,

367
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,240
go with them.

368
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,240
Hurry.

369
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,240
The sound is getting closer. Hurry.

370
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,240
Everyone, leave.

371
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
Go with them.

372
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,240
Hurry.

373
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,240
Qingqing, take this.

374
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,240
It records everything

375
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,240
that happened in the Su Village.

376
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,240
You'll know what the clans

377
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,240
went through after you see it.

378
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,240
Take it with you.

379
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,240
Go.

380
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,240
Granny.

381
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,240
Go.

382
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,240
Go.

383
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,240
If it's really

384
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,240
what the wall said,

385
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
that the Longevity Deity Herb is problematic,

386
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,240
do we still have to bring this

387
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,240
harmful thing back to the capital?

388
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,240
No matter how good or bad

389
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,240
the Longevity Deity Herb is,

390
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,240
how it should be used,

391
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,240
it's none of our business.

392
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,240
If the Longevity Deity Herb is used by the evil,

393
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,240
then the people of my Shang Mountain

394
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,240
will be involved.

395
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,240
The people's business is the king's business.

396
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
You can't control it.

397
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,240
If the people of Shang Mountain

398
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,240
can't be controlled,

399
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,240
who's the leader of Shang Mountain?

400
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,240
Enough. Stop arguing.

401
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,240
We're just guessing.

402
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,240
What's the use of the Longevity Deity Herb?

403
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,240
We'll know after we find it.

404
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,240
What's going on?

405
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,240
Someone just flashed by.

406
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
Today is really unlucky.

407
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,240
Ju Li, did you see clearly

408
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,240
what he looks like?

409
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,240
No.

410
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,240
This person must be related to that drum.

411
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,240
It's that damn drum again.

412
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,240
I should have kicked it twice just now.

413
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,240
We were careless.

414
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,240
I didn't expect his accomplice

415
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,240
to come so soon.

416
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,240
A hidden,

417
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,240
hidden, and unshaken thing.

418
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,240
Someone came out to fight with you.

419
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,240
The evil spirit of the Longevity Deity Herb

420
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,240
is here.

421
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,240
What kind of hero is he?

422
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,240
Stop arguing.

423
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,240
It's so unlucky today.

424
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,240
Why don't you let me say more?

425
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
What are you doing?

426
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,240
Dig a hole and climb out.

427
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,240
You can dig a hole so hard?

428
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,240
I don't know which idiot

429
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,240
made this secret room.

430
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,240
Who made this kind of secret room?

431
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,240
No.

432
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,240
When did you two laugh?

433
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,240
I'm the only one who's afraid of

434
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,240
being stuck here, right?

435
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,240
These secret rooms and the cave outside

436
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,240
were made by the ancestors of the You Su clan.

437
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,240
Since they want to inherit the descendants of their ancestors,

438
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,240
they can't build a secret room

439
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,240
that's so quiet.

440
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,240
Then, the Dragon Stone at the door,

441
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,240
the stone door,

442
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,240
it's more like preventing the outsiders from coming in and going out.

443
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,240
The purpose

444
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,240
should be to protect something

445
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,240
from being taken out.

446
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,240
There's nothing to take out.

447
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,240
Look over there.

448
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
Aren't there just some decorated stone sculptures?

449
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,240
Look behind you.

450
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,240
Is there a light?

451
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,240
What's so special?

452
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,240
The whole secret room is closed.

453
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,240
But there's only one light.

454
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,240
Yes.

455
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,240
Why is that?

456
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,240
We'll know when we try.

457
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,240
This shadow is pointing at the valley.

458
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,240
Could this be the secret room?

459
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,240
This secret room is to protect her.

460
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,240
Look.

461
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,240
This should be the map of the secret room.

462
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
This position.

463
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,240
We should be able to find the exit.

464
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,240
There's really no way out.

465
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,240
I'll just say it.

466
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,240
I'm lucky.

467
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,240
How can I find the exit?

468
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,240
I'll just say it.

469
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,240
I'm lucky.

470
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,240
Let's go, Brother Chong.

471
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,240
Find the exit.

472
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,240
What's wrong?

473
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,240
This is the sign of the sacred temple.

474
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,240
Where's the girl?

475
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,240
I'm going to see Aunt Su.

476
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,240
If she's alright, she'll come to see us later.

477
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,240
If something happened to her,

478
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,240
what's the point of her going?

479
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,240
I can't leave her alone.

480
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,240
You can't go.

481
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,240
You can't leave her alone.

482
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,240
I'll go with you.

483
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,240
You can't go.

484
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,240
You can't go.

485
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,240
You can't go.

486
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
You can't leave her alone.

487
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,240
You can't go.

488
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,680
I can't leave him alone

489
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,880
Miss, there is a long story

490
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,080
How can we explain it to Lord Gu Xi

491
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,120
and the Crown Prince Zhu Wei?

492
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,840
I have no credit

493
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,520
and no effort these days

494
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,440
Please forgive me

495
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,280
Qingqing

496
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,040
You are back

497
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,880
Did you find any clues?

498
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,280
It's a long story

499
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,800
I have been working for the

500
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,960
Immortal Medicine of the Hu Hou Yi clan

501
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,080
and the Holy Valley

502
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,880
to pacify the chaos and build the Shangshan

503
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,600
Now the divine power is back

504
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,920
The mountain collapsed

505
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,960
and the people were angry

506
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,400
This is an ominous sign

507
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,680
In order to show my regret

508
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,000
I returned the divine power to the upper hall

509
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,040
From now on

510
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,400
the nine Hu Hou Yi tribes

511
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,000
are divided into the two tribes of the Tushan of Yousu

512
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,640
The Yusu clan preserves the holy valley

513
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,400
and the foreign country far away

514
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,200
The Tushan clan guards the immortal medicine

515
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,400
The two tribes have been inseparable

516
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,480
due to Ning Zhou

517
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,520
If the immortal medicine and the holy valley are together again

518
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,360
the nine states will be destroyed

519
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,720
and the world will be in chaos

520
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,480
The holy valley and the immortal medicine

521
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,800
The Tushan clan in the legend

522
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,320
actually came to the same place as us

523
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,680
If it is said by the will of God

524
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:40,960
the immortal medicine

525
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,800
should be managed by Tushan

526
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,440
But the change of Ning Zhou a few decades ago

527
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,080
Ning Bo Hou should not have got nothing

528
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,200
Or before this

529
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,960
someone has already found it

530
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,320
If the immortal medicine

531
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,000
is really as the painting says

532
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,760
will turn people into monsters

533
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,200
Then this immortal medicine

534
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,400
is likely to be in the middle of the age

535
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,840
a few years ago

536
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,440
and then there will be a change of Kun Fu

537
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,880
Then the ancient immortal medicine

538
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,720
is going to be in chaos

539
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,080
if it is held again

540
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,160
Today I met the mother of Su in the forest

541
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,440
In order to protect me

542
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,200
she led the people of the Ghost Clan away

543
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,480
and left this to me

544
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,560
It is the evil done by the Su family

545
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,600
over the years

546
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,800
The evil done by the Su family?

547
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,200
Cut off the skin

548
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,840
The Su family

549
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,840
has its roots

550
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,920
and is rooted in the holy temple

551
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,920
It is not the will of God

552
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,840
to change one's power and body

553
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,000
It is not the will of God

554
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,520
to change one's power and body

555
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,360
It is not the will of God

556
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,760
to change one's power and body

557
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,560
I was born as a Saintess

558
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,400
I didn't want to protect myself

559
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,480
I pretended to be a fool for many years

560
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,320
and then I was killed

561
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,760
But I was also killed

562
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,880
The Su family is forever in danger

563
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,760
I was ordered by the Saintess

564
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,680
to return to the Su family

565
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,840
to keep the promise of the Su family

566
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,440
to the immortal

567
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,240
The way Qui Fang set up an army

568
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,840
killed the mixture of the Monk and The equipment

569
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,960
and killed the chancellors

570
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,920
and the same killer

571
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,040
as the Du holla

572
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,440
the day I die

573
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,800
I will change myself

574
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,760
Be a member of the other clan

575
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,760
and dan Capital

576
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,760
So, other than the little girl,

577
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,160
Granny Su actually has the Holy Blood of the Saintess.

578
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,760
Granny Su, in order to save us,

579
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,360
is still in danger of death.

580
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,760
Her whereabouts are unknown.

581
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,560
Wait.

582
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,760
If, as you said, the ancient medicine of the gods is already in our hands,

583
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,560
we have already seen the ancient medicine today,

584
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,760
then where is the medicine?

585
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,760
Everyone, we seem to have overlooked one thing.

586
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,760
Qingqing said that Granny Su

587
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,760
knew that Qingqing wanted to escape from Qingluan Mountain

588
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,760
several times before she died.

589
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,160
She has been there. She is a member of the Su clan.

590
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,160
She is familiar with the terrain.

591
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,160
She asked me to open the Central Plains and guard the border.

592
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,760
The Gui Fang people are not familiar with the area.

593
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,560
They asked me to open the Central Plains and guard the border.

594
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,760
How did the Gui Fang people

595
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,560
enter Qingluan Mountain?

596
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:38,960
How did they stay in front of the Central Plains and guard the border for several years?

597
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,160
What you mean is...

598
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,760
First,

599
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,960
they know how to enter the secret passage of Qingluan Mountain.

600
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,560
Second,

601
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,960
behind them, there are extremely powerful Central Plains and guard the border.

602
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,960
Helping them to cover up.

603
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,960
Hiding here if they find out that the four spending men

604
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,360
joined the SecretToo 찍才一起来

605
00:29:59,360 --> 00:29:59,960
The Fifth,

606
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,360
the right-hand person was toopieces and flighty.

607
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,460
What?

608
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,560
What did you think of now?

609
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,160
What is it?

610
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,760
The extremely powerful Central Plains

611
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,160
can't be Xian Xuanji, can it?

612
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,440
But it's not good for you.

613
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,320
Mr. Jiang.

614
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,400
The guards of Mount Jin are looking for people.

615
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,040
They've found the way.

616
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,880
You can go back to the city soon.

617
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,560
Don't make more troubles.

618
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,640
We'll solve the problem of the separation.

619
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,040
We won't bother you.

620
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,360
Okay.

621
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,840
We don't want to cause any trouble.

622
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,440
But the real man...

623
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,320
I have a message for you.

624
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,640
Don't believe the people around you.

625
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,160
My Lord.

626
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,840
Jiang Wenhuan and the others have found the valley.

627
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,320
Nonsense.

628
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,520
Nonsense?

629
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,920
We transferred the valley to them

630
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,880
before they were prepared.

631
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,920
We also caught the old living people who had been hiding for years.

632
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,120
I didn't expect that the saintess was hiding.

633
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,760
There are others.

634
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,200
Go to prepare.

635
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:29,920
Yes.

636
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,440
After so many years,

637
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,320
it's time to make a move.

638
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,160
So,

639
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,400
there's no trace of the man.

640
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,000
I've visited Guifang for many times.

641
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,040
I know he's the new noble

642
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,680
who rose up in Guifang's nobility.

643
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,040
His origin and whereabouts are very mysterious.

644
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,440
After the case of the Eastern Courtyard,

645
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,240
he didn't return to Guifang.

646
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,360
Instead,

647
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,760
he disappeared.

648
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,600
That means

649
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
the imperial guard was established in Donglu City.

650
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,360
The envoy of Guifang appeared.

651
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,400
The imperial guard went to the Zhongli for medicine.

652
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,280
The envoy of Guifang disappeared.

653
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,560
The imperial guard means

654
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,720
his target may be

655
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,200
the imperial guard?

656
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,000
Not the imperial guard.

657
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,880
The imperial guard is the immortal medicine

658
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,720
the princes are looking for.

659
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,720
Get a carriage.

660
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,120
I'm going out.

661
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,920
No, your highness.

662
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,280
You're just getting better.

663
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,120
You need to rest well.

664
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,360
You can't keep this little thing.

665
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,480
Little thing?

666
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,160
He's well-prepared.

667
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,880
He even dares not to underestimate me.

668
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,680
I must go there in person.

669
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,680
Zhongli?

670
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:27,680
No.

671
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,400
Mount Tu.

672
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,600
Mount Tu?

673
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,680
There must be

674
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,120
some clues that have been ignored.

675
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,080
Your time has come.

676
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,200
Young lady.

677
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,600
I'm sorry.

678
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,400
Your highness, you're in a good mood today.

679
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,560
Dream comes true.

680
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,160
Year comes true.

681
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,240
Who knows the past?

682
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,680
The stars in the world

683
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,680
are like the stars.

684
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,320
The white-haired man is like the red-haired man.

685
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,680
The young man meets the wind as the shadow of the moon.

686
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,160
He is not ashamed of the world and his love.

687
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,880
The hatred is deep.

688
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,000
The red-haired man is like the red-haired man.

689
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,880
The young man meets the wind as the shadow of the moon.

690
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,000
The young man meets the wind as the shadow of the moon.

691
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,120
Your Massachusetts.

692
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,280
Your continuance.

693
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,280
Your tortilla Turns into an management system.

694
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,520
25 years is just an вз 살.

695
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,320
Words cannot be Tesla.

696
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,000
He doesn't even have a number.

697
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,560
My relationship with you is non-tailing.

698
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:17,840
What is it?

699
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,280
The moon's long 집.

700
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,420
This sword is so that you have to get it once before entering the harem.

701
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,340
Please make itидioper homosexual.

702
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,380
Happy Rain season.

703
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:05,460
I'm happy about the gourmet of this world.

704
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,460
I'm fine with that now.

705
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:10,380
I ate too much and I'm a little الأowski.

706
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,580
Thanks, Ninth God.

707
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,300
It's ok.
