1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,180
Cooling through the

2
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:46,100
chapter 1

3
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:55,140
Cut up the

4
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,980
I wish to be the mountain and the sea, and I will be the cloud.

5
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,180
I wish to be the love and the dream, and I will never stop.

6
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,700
I will never give up and I will be the sky and the earth.

7
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,460
I will be the end of our love.

8
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:15,980
I will never stop until the dawn breaks.

9
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,980
Episode 15

10
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,140
What's wrong? What happened?

11
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,140
How could this happen? What did you do to him?

12
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,140
He touched this.

13
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,140
Blood crystal?

14
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,140
Why did you do this?

15
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,140
It's said that Anas is not infected with the poison of Ba Shi.

16
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,140
Why did you do this?

17
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,140
Maybe because...

18
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,140
Shi'er has been in a coma for many years.

19
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,140
She's in a state of life.

20
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,140
So this blood crystal also has a repressive effect on him?

21
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,140
Girl, can you not tell anyone about this?

22
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,140
If others know about this, I'm afraid Shi'er will be in danger.

23
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,140
Your second brother is still in a coma.

24
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,140
If you tell him about this, it will only ease his worries.

25
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,140
Then Shi'er will be in a coma.

26
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,140
I really can't take such a big risk.

27
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,140
Please, okay?

28
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,140
Then let's cure Shi'er first.

29
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,140
You can save him.

30
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,140
I'm sure you can cure him.

31
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,140
The way to cure him should be similar to what Xiao Yi said.

32
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,140
But Anas has been in a coma for many years.

33
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,140
His body is too weak.

34
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,140
He might not be able to take the medicine.

35
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,140
I just want to be with him.

36
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,600
Your Highness, please accept my apologies for my incompetence.

37
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,700
You have always been câmera sort of girlfriend.

38
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,840
Your Highness, as Your Highness doubts the power of justice.

39
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,080
At present, Should not handles such hahre diegi-ah,

40
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,320
This is most important place.

41
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,360
Then from now on,

42
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,980
The討好者君邀 probability is l hilft-d sums

43
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,740
will be grease your hands.

44
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,340
I'll go to the mountain to look for it now.

45
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,740
Stop.

46
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,740
Where are you going?

47
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,340
To pick herbs.

48
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,140
Her medicine was already here yesterday.

49
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,340
You said it yourself.

50
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,740
Zhongliyuan's fishers are still running around.

51
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,540
You can't go out.

52
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,340
What are you doing?

53
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,740
You go with me.

54
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,340
Together.

55
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,340
I'm not going.

56
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,340
This mountain forest seed is born in bamboo forest.

57
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,340
In the bamboo forest,

58
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,740
only the first-born bamboo is born.

59
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,340
What do you mean?

60
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,540
Do you know what is the common birth of bamboo forest?

61
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,740
Bamboo in the forest is connected to each other.

62
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:46,940
They live and die together.

63
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,140
That's it.

64
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,940
And the bamboo born in the forest

65
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,740
is the female bamboo that gives birth to this bamboo forest.

66
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,740
So it is often hidden very carefully.

67
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,140
It's hard to distinguish the flesh and the skin.

68
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,740
Only when the wind blows through the bamboo forest,

69
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,940
can it be found by the sound of the bamboo leaves.

70
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,540
What kind of sound is that?

71
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,540
It's like the sound of breathing.

72
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,140
So I want you to help me

73
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,140
to listen to the sound of the bamboo.

74
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,140
Is that okay?

75
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:16,940
Yes.

76
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,940
The sound of the bamboo is the same.

77
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,140
I can't hear any difference.

78
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,140
Master said

79
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,940
he can't hear the sound of the bamboo forest

80
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,340
maybe because he has too many thoughts in his heart.

81
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,740
Otherwise, you can close your eyes.

82
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,340
Don't think about anything when you come to the bottom of the forest.

83
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,540
Feel it with your heart.

84
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,740
Mr. Cheng, listen to it.

85
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,340
What can you hear?

86
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,940
Plow the bamboo by hand.

87
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,340
Yes.

88
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,340
Your surname is Chong.

89
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,940
The bamboo will always remember that

90
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,740
something is right

91
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,740
and something is wrong.

92
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,740
Your mother is the prostitute

93
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,140
who literature looks down upon.

94
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,160
only drink to destroy them down here

95
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,400
only drink to destroy them down there

96
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,140
I...

97
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,740
I found it.

98
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,860
Over there.

99
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,140
Are you sure it's her?

100
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,860
But where is the medicine?

101
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,340
shade

102
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,720
What are you doing?

103
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,320
There are soft f Spit bloodуль feathers on born bine fields

104
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,080
Once the hair is sucked into the mouth,

105
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,400
it will be dangerous for life.

106
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,560
Jiang Yiyou,

107
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,640
do you know what you were doing just now?

108
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,280
Didn't you say that thing was poisonous?

109
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,480
What if you were sucked in?

110
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,160
I'll take you out.

111
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,240
I'll be responsible for your safety.

112
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,160
You're talking too fast.

113
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,880
If something happens to you,

114
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,600
it's my responsibility.

115
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,160
Do you know that?

116
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,920
I can't see what you mean.

117
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,560
Jiang Yiyou.

118
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,760
Slow down.

119
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,560
Okay, go on.

120
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,040
I'll know what you're talking about

121
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,720
when I touch your mouth.

122
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,720
Nothing will happen to me

123
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,960
as long as you're here.

124
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,560
Nothing will happen to me

125
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,960
as long as you're here.

126
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,880
From now on,

127
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,400
you don't need to risk your life to save me.

128
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,080
Do you understand?

129
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,360
But...

130
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,440
From now on,

131
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,960
this is the life-saving needle that I'm giving you.

132
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,160
Three days ago,

133
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,200
I was about to see 고쉐 since I was very mad.

134
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,520
But not since then.

135
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,920
And now,

136
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,640
I only have oneBu,

137
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,760
and they're gone for some time.

138
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
I saw you

139
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,000
and asked you to go back to betrothal.

140
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,400
But I한Cao only seems

141
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,320
angry,

142
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,960
and he won't leave you.

143
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,720
deputy director,

144
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,160
whom we can bemotion.

145
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,600
Yes.

146
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,720
So miserable and Assimilated.

147
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,960
There's no chance

148
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,520
for me to tell her.

149
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,000
For the last ten seconds,

150
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,440
if she ever said anything to you,

151
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,240
He asked me to promise him

152
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,800
to protect the State of Zhongli and the people of Zhongli.

153
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,320
I promised him.

154
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,040
But you're going back to Donglu, aren't you?

155
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,000
I've promised him

156
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,440
that I would do it.

157
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,200
I'll go.

158
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,040
Sister,

159
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,760
do you know where Mr. Gongsun is?

160
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,920
He went to buy medicine for An Nashi.

161
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,480
News came from Zhongli Palace

162
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,840
and asked us to go into the palace.

163
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,640
Mr. Gongsun is not here.

164
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,720
You stay at home.

165
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,840
I'll be back soon.

166
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,480
Let's go.

167
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,560
Sheng Citizens Group

168
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,020
ً

169
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,880
Master, Mrs. Lin Qiao

170
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,880
is well prepared now.

171
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,480
As a simple brainless fellow,

172
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,600
Zhong Linyuan goes into miserable death.

173
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,400
Now,

174
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,320
our plan

175
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,040
can't be availed of easily anymore.

176
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,680
Yes.

177
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,560
I'll get rid of him this time.

178
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,040
Where's Han Dashi?

179
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,320
Why is he gone?

180
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,600
The scenery of Zhongli is really good.

181
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,400
I also think that Zhongli is better than Donglu.

182
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,720
This is your hometown after all.

183
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,000
Brother Zhang, Brother E.

184
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,400
Where are you going?

185
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,480
We have a message from the Zhongli Palace.

186
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,920
They want us to go into the palace.

187
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,640
They said that the Crown Prince should help us if something happened.

188
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,720
You two are not here.

189
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,880
We said that we should go into the palace to check what's going on.

190
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,680
Brother E, you go first.

191
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,600
I'll go first.

192
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,840
I'll go first.

193
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,720
You go first.

194
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,960
I'll go first.

195
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,400
Brother E, you go first.

196
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,240
What's going on?

197
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,040
Does the Crown Prince need to be helped?

198
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,640
What can it be?

199
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,760
The officials of Zhongli

200
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,840
are currently in charge of the affairs of the government.

201
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,200
Even if they have something important to say,

202
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,720
how can they send us messages from the palace?

203
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,400
Could it be that someone disguised as a person from Zhongli

204
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,720
and sent us false messages?

205
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,120
Who is so careless?

206
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,120
What's the purpose of this?

207
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,120
Oh no.

208
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,840
The Marten and Tiger Mountain.

209
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,960
Where are you going?

210
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,560
There's only one person in the post.

211
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,360
Yi Yao.

212
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,000
Yi Yao.

213
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,120
Yi Yao.

214
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,240
Search the place.

215
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
How could it be gone?

216
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,720
The bell of the medicine.

217
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,240
Could it be...

218
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
Something happened to the medicine?

219
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,160
Brother.

220
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,840
Brother Jiang's wound is rejuvenating.

221
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,160
I'll take him to the medicine first.

222
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:32,880
Brother Chong.

223
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,480
You go to find An Nashi and the medicine.

224
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,920
Brother Xin Jia.

225
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,160
You go to find Mr. Gongsun.

226
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
You must tell him about this.

227
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,080
Jiang Xiong and I will be there soon.

228
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,080
Hurry up.

229
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,400
It's strange.

230
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,880
Where did it go?

231
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,680
The location is complicated.

232
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,400
Let's make a mark on the map.

233
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,000
You go.

234
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,320
Yi You.

235
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,340
Yi You.

236
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,720
Yi You.

237
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,920
Ji Yao!

238
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
Search again!

239
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,920
Brother Cheng, it's gone.

240
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,920
Search again.

241
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,920
Search separately!

242
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,920
Search again.

243
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,920
Why are there so many strange lines here?

244
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,920
An Nashi!

245
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,920
What is this?

246
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,920
These are strange lines tied to trees.

247
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,920
Why are they tied to An Nashi?

248
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,920
An Nashi!

249
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,920
An Nashi!

250
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,920
Let's go.

251
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
Let's go.

252
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,920
Since you've found out

253
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,640
Yinorou!

254
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,040
Yinorou!

255
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,540
Yinorou!

256
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,680
Yinorou!

257
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,220
Yinorou!

258
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,500
Yinorou!

259
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Are you drunk?

260
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,260
Do not move!

261
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:10,920
The Long Ballad

262
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,920
Episode 18

263
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,920
You guys, go check out the front.

264
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
Yes.

265
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,920
Miss, we're almost in Zhongli City.

266
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,920
We've been driving all night to the Super Street.

267
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,920
It must be hard on you.

268
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
You're out of town.

269
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,920
It's our duty to follow you.

270
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,920
Let's go.

271
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Let's go.

272
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,920
Miss! Miss!

273
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,920
There's a dead man in front of us!

274
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,920
It's not surprising that there are dead men in the old forest.

275
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,920
You've been walking in the martial arts world for so many years.

276
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,920
A dead man is not that bad.

277
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,920
Her Love

278
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
Miss!

279
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,920
Pan Chituteng?

280
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,920
We just Interneted now.

281
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,920
Take this away.

282
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,160
I'm sorry.

283
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,000
Mr. Gongsun,

284
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,560
don't worry too much.

285
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,880
There's a way out for the good man.

286
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,680
Anna will be safe and sound.

287
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,920
It's all my fault.

288
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,480
I shouldn't have bought the medicine at that time.

289
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,000
I shouldn't have left halfway.

290
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Don't worry.

291
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,160
We found Anashi!

292
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,240
Shi!

293
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,280
Shi!

294
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,280
Let's go in.

295
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,560
Have you found the medicine?

296
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,000
Your Majesty, we've been looking for it outside.

297
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,080
Where did you find

298
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,240
Anashi?

299
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,040
I was looking for Lin Zhong.

300
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,200
I found a person from the Ghost Realm.

301
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,200
I almost caught him.

302
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,000
He ran away alone.

303
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,760
He had a strange wound on his arm.

304
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,480
It looked like he was bleeding from an acupuncture.

305
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,520
I don't know how long he's been bleeding.

306
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,640
I have to find the medicine.

307
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,120
The Ghost Realm caught him.

308
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,640
He was bleeding.

309
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,160
Why?

310
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,600
My friend is Inazumaru's friend.

311
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,480
Ma'am, here it is.

312
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,440
Shi!

313
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,560
Brother, look who's here.

314
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
just need to keep waking alone

315
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,780
there is no use thinking for the future

316
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,320
independence me

317
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,580
tickets

318
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,540
I don't think we need to think about you

319
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:50,920
Sa god

320
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,000
why do you feel scared

321
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,540
Fe vacancy

322
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,220
we can just forget about it

323
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,680
it looks like that

324
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,880
at that time

325
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,080
I'll be a little happy

326
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,640
We met a girl on the way here.

327
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,360
She seems to be from your family.

328
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,800
I wonder if you know her.

329
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,320
You found my sister, Yi Yao?

330
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,160
Where is she?

331
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,600
She is your sister?

332
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,320
When we saw her,

333
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,680
she had...

334
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,080
Come in.

335
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,960
Why did it have to be like this?

336
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,120
집 decree.

337
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,040
Why is it the same?

338
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,080
Who are you?

339
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,080
I wanted to make her feel at ease.

340
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,520
But I don't know why

341
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,880
she refused to close her eyes.

342
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,240
Maybe

343
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,320
she still wants to see

344
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,760
someone she hasn't seen yet.

345
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,880
I'm sorry.

346
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,800
I'm sorry.

347
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,600
I'm sorry.

348
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,400
I'm sorry.

349
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,080
I'm sorry.

350
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,800
I'm sorry.

351
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,600
I'm sorry.

352
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,280
I'm sorry.

353
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:45,880
I'm sorry.

354
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,600
I'm sorry.

355
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,280
I'm sorry.

356
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:50,880
I'm sorry.

357
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,480
I'm sorry.

358
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,080
I'm sorry.

359
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,680
I'm sorry.

360
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,280
I'm sorry.

361
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:58,880
I'm sorry.

362
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,800
I'm sorry.

363
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,680
I heard that

364
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,480
the sunset on the grasslands is beautiful.

365
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,280
Is it?

366
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,000
If I have a chance in the future,

367
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,880
can you take me there?

368
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,560
Yu Yao.

369
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,480
The sunset today

370
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,880
is the most

371
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,480
similar to the grasslands.

372
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,880
I did what I promised you.

373
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,580
So tiring.

374
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,880
I don't want to be left behind

375
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,880
The journey is bumpy, who can apologize for the past

376
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,880
The wind is howling, the dust is like me

377
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,880
Flowing and drifting

378
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,880
There is always a glimmer of light

379
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,880
That can illuminate the night

380
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,880
This is the rope of peace

381
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,880
I hope that the brothers will return safely tomorrow

382
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,880
The sound of the flute is like the snow falling

383
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,880
The night rain is heavy, who can explain the reality

384
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,880
I don't want you and me

385
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,880
The candlelight is lit, the smile is bright

386
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,880
When did the dream stop

387
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,880
I'll wait for you

388
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,880
The beautiful river flows

389
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,880
The water is like the sky

390
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,880
The old dream is like a farewell

391
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,880
The love is like a rain

392
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,880
I can't see you in my eyes

393
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,880
Looking back at each other

394
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:19,880
The love is like a picture

395
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:41,880
Like a rain, I can't tell right from wrong

396
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:49,880
The girl said she hoped that the snow would melt

397
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,880
The last road of medicine

398
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,880
Who said I was not willing to be with you

399
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,880
I want to be with you

400
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,880
The smile is like the past

401
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,880
When did the dream stop

402
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,880
The sound of the flute is like the wind

403
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,880
The past is gone with the wind

404
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,880
The sky is like the sky

405
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:27,880
The sun and the moon, the stars and the sky are like you

406
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,880
The smile is like the past

407
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:34,880
The sound of the flute is like the wind

408
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,880
The past is gone with the wind

409
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:42,880
The sky is like the sky

410
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,880
The love is like the sky

411
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:50,880
The love is like the sky

412
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:55,880
The love is like the sky

413
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,880
The love is like the sky

414
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,880
It's like the wind

415
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,880
The sound of the flute is like the wind

416
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,880
The wind is like the wind

417
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:19,880
The sky is like the wind

418
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:26,880
The wind is like the wind

419
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,480
Where did you find Gongsun Wu Yu?

420
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,480
North Gate of Zhongli City.

421
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,840
Your Majesty.

422
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,000
Queenọi

423
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,760
Your Majesty.

424
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:26,080
My poor friend,

425
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:32,740
What a precious France

426
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:36,220
A new generation

427
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,720
With no regrets

428
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:47,980
What a beautiful France

429
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,120
Who's married

430
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:54,200
Came to pay herida

431
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,040
This cold blade

432
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:00,020
at every turn

433
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,460
A Milanese family

434
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,600
Yi Yu

435
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,140
Yi Yu

436
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,400
Yi Yu

437
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,060
Yi Yu

438
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,120
Yi Yu

439
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,960
Yi Yu

440
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,060
Yi Yu

441
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,280
Yi Yu

442
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,000
Yi Yu

443
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,940
The Feudal youngster,

444
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,940
we knew each other the most.
