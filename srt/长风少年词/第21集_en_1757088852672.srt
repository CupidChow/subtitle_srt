1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,640
The broken dream in the breath

2
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,360
Even time can be far away

3
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,520
Prepare to change

4
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,080
The most unscrupulous street

5
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,560
The nation is warm and the snow is melting

6
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,080
In the distance, I have no limits

7
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,840
Even if time is tired and determined

8
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,720
Look at the small and long night, the bitter and happy days

9
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,880
The years and months in front of you

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,680
The sky is the mountain, the sky is the cloud

11
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,920
No one is more determined than the sky

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,440
The sky is the blade, the blade is broken

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,000
Love and dreams are immortal

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,560
Unable to stop the heart and the heaven and earth

15
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,320
Only for the end in each other's hearts

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,880
Until the dawn breaks

17
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,840
Never stop

18
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,840
The End

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,840
Episode 1

20
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,680
Open the banquet

21
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,440
I propose a toast to you

22
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,600
Thank you, Lord Gongsun

23
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,000
and all the members of the Crown Prince Camp

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,120
Thank you all

25
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,080
for helping me to pacify the internal chaos in Zhongli

26
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,280
and kill the evil and make the country prosperous

27
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,400
You are too kind, Your Majesty

28
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,920
Lord Taotie and the Crown Prince Camp

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,400
are not involved in the internal affairs of Zhongli

30
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,160
Besides, the state preceptor

31
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,480
was killed by you

32
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,920
We didn't help

33
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,920
I understand

34
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,720
I will explain to you

35
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,400
I won't involve you

36
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,760
Your Majesty

37
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,680
The Crown Prince Camp is under your command

38
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,200
to find the immortality medicine

39
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,280
Now the trouble is out

40
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,040
We will continue to find the immortality medicine

41
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,600
for His Majesty

42
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,000
Please help us, Your Majesty

43
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,720
Don't worry, Your Highness

44
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,280
I have ordered people to go to the collection room

45
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,280
to find the ancient information

46
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,080
Once we find the ancient information

47
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,000
we will inform you immediately

48
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,880
Thank you, Your Majesty

49
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,800
I have one more thing to ask for your help

50
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,480
It's okay, Your Highness

51
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,760
Now, the Xuan Xuan Ji is dead

52
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,440
The Kun family and the You Su clan

53
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,120
were killed by her

54
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,920
and the You Su Saintess who escaped from death

55
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,800
I hope you can help them

56
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,400
I am so stupid

57
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,200
I forgot the important thing

58
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,160
Somebody

59
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,920
Announce the edict

60
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,480
The old tribe of Kun

61
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,040
The You Su Saintess, Su Qingqing

62
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,280
is here to receive the edict

63
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,800
The king is here to protect the country

64
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,280
She has been humiliated for many years

65
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,040
She is ordered to remove the circle

66
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,120
General Gu, Kun Ze, and General Zhonglie

67
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,680
and the Saintess, Su Ying

68
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,080
Madam Ying Yi

69
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,440
Thank you, Your Majesty

70
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,360
Essa

71
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,840
Please

72
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,400
auspicious lighting

73
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,200
Mike

74
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,780
I can help you

75
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,440
This wszystkim

76
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,960
If I bring one to you

77
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,280
would the redcream

78
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,320
be so good?

79
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,960
the redcream

80
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,240
the redcream

81
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:20,240
To see you and Madam's remains can't be found

82
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,900
God, please help us

83
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,100
However, the emperor and the Madam's bones were gone

84
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,260
Let's hope Chief luggage worker

85
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,600
can Turtle in their hands

86
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,600
I didn't fail you.

87
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Now that I've avenged you,

88
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,600
I still can't use my true identity to show my respect.

89
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
I hope that you,

90
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
mother,

91
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
won't blame me for being unfilial.

92
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
One day,

93
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,600
I will use my future identity

94
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
to revive the Kun family

95
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
and make the spirit of the Kun family

96
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
last forever.

97
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
Qingqing,

98
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
you're leaving for Su Village today.

99
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Have you made the arrangements?

100
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Of course.

101
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,600
The Master has arranged a golden crane to escort me back.

102
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
If everyone knows that

103
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Su Village has been sealed,

104
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
they will be very happy.

105
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
But,

106
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
I haven't seen

107
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
the people of Su Village for a long time.

108
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
I don't know how they are doing.

109
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
And the one who loved me most when I was a child,

110
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
that Granny Su.

111
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
I don't know if she is still alive.

112
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Oh, right.

113
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
And the flower sea

114
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
we used to go to when we were young.

115
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
I don't know if there is any left.

116
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Brother,

117
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
what's wrong?

118
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
I was supposed to accompany you

119
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
to go back together.

120
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
If you go back with me now,

121
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
it will cause other people to doubt.

122
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
That's right.

123
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,600
I'm not trapped yet.

124
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
The Su Village can be sealed.

125
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,600
Thanks to

126
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
Brother and the members of the Crown Prince Camp.

127
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
Now it's sealed.

128
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Why don't you have a chance

129
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,600
to go back to Su Village with me?

130
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Hu Hu, Qingqing.

131
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Mr. Jiang.

132
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,600
You've finished your work?

133
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
It's good

134
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
to see your brother.

135
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
What?

136
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
It's been a long time.

137
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
It's time to relax.

138
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,600
Let's go.

139
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Let's go.

140
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
I'll take you to this place.

141
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
What?

142
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Hurry up.

143
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
Hurry up.

144
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
Uncle.

145
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
Hu.

146
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Uncle.

147
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,600
Have you missed me?

148
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
Of course.

149
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,600
I've been waiting for you for so long

150
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
just to show you

151
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
what I learned from Uncle Lin

152
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,600
in Kun's Tongxiang Town.

153
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
You've learned the Tongxiang Town?

154
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
Wait a minute.

155
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,600
You have to take a good look.

156
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,600
Okay.

157
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
I know you've always wanted to come back.

158
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
But I dare not go there.

159
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,600
I'll take care of you today.

160
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Don't worry.

161
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
Go in and have a look.

162
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Go.

163
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
Brother.

164
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
Here, have some water.

165
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Wu'er, the horse is stable.

166
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
You have to use your power.

167
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Yes.

168
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
Look at this man.

169
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Come again later.

170
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
I want to drink water, too.

171
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,600
I want to ride a horse, too.

172
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
I want to wipe my sweat, too.

173
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
Here, I'll pour you some water.

174
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Come, take a break.

175
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Have a cake.

176
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Anye.

177
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
I'm finally back.

178
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
General Kun.

179
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Madam Kun.

180
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Your son is not only back,

181
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
but also became the bravest warrior in Zhongli.

182
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
He not only helped the Kun family,

183
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
but also saved me many times in danger.

184
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
If it weren't for him,

185
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,600
I may not have the chance

186
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
to meet you again.

187
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
If my parents were alive,

188
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
they would have seen me with the wounded Donglu.

189
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
I'm afraid they would use Kun's stick

190
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
to hit me with my legs.

191
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
How could it be?

192
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
We are brothers.

193
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
How could we have a family sword?

194
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Besides,

195
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
my uncle and aunt

196
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
are not so ignorant.

197
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Don't make a mess.

198
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Uncle, aunt.

199
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,600
This cup of wine

200
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
is for you.

201
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Thank you for raising this kid.

202
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
I'm so grateful to you.

203
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
Uncle, aunt.

204
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Uncle, aunt.

205
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Don't worry.

206
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,600
With you as my best friend,

207
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
I'm not alone

208
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,600
in your son's life.

209
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Wait.

210
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
Just best friend?

211
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,600
I mean,

212
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
how many times have we been friends?

213
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
At least we are brothers.

214
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Is it?

215
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Yes.

216
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
In that case,

217
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
it's better to meet in the next life

218
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
than today.

219
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
How about we become brothers?

220
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Didn't we meet in Donglu?

221
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
I think

222
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
it's a target for Eashun.

223
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
What?

224
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Are you Eashun?

225
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
I'm the son of the Dongwu Jiang family.

226
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
Jiang Wenhuan.

227
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,600
I'm the son of Kun Wu, the son of the Kun family.

228
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
Yu Kunwu.

229
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
I'm the son of the Dongwu Jiang family.

230
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
I'm Jiang Wenhuan.

231
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
We are brothers.

232
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
From now on,

233
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
we are brothers.

234
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
We will be together in this life.

235
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
We will help each other.

236
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,600
We will help each other.

237
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,600
We will be together in this life.

238
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,600
We will be together in this life.

239
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
The End

240
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
How old are you?

241
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
I...

242
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
This year...

243
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,600
Don't talk about it.

244
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
I'm definitely older than you.

245
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,600
Call me brother.

246
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
Really?

247
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
Call me brother.

248
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
After we find Xianyao,

249
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,600
and leave Zhongli,

250
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,600
we will travel around the country.

251
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
For example,

252
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,600
we will go to Chongxiong's grassland

253
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,600
to see the star river.

254
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
Or

255
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,600
we will go to Xinjia's land

256
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,600
to see the beauties in her mouth.

257
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
These beauties

258
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,600
won't be too bad, right?

259
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
The End

260
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
It's late.

261
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
You can leave now.

262
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
Yes.

263
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
The End

264
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
Why is the chest of Black Water Pool

265
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,600
like this?

266
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,600
This secret room has been here for many years.

267
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,600
There shouldn't be anything strange.

268
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Gu Xi,

269
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
what are you suspecting?

270
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,600
By the way,

271
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Su Jingqing has entered Mount Qingyuan.

272
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
You can start now.

273
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
Yes.

274
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
What's going on?

275
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Why don't you move forward?

276
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Beast Girl,

277
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
there's fog ahead.

278
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
It's dangerous.

279
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
We shouldn't go.

280
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Why is the fog suddenly getting bigger?

281
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
What's going on?

282
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
What's going on?

283
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
What's going on?

284
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
What's going on?

285
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
What's going on?

286
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
What's going on?

287
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,600
What's going on?

288
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
What's going on?

289
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
Divine Granny?

290
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,600
What are you doing here?

291
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
I didn't let you in.

292
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Jiang Wenhuan.

293
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
Jiang Wenhuan.

294
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Did I let you in?

295
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
I have something to say.

296
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
How did you lie to us this time?

297
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,600
I sent the map of Zhongli Palace.

298
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
I know.

299
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
So I'm not your enemy.

300
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
You may not be.

301
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
But you are.

302
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,600
But how do we know

303
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,600
if you're behind this?

304
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,600
I know.

305
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,600
You don't want to believe me.

306
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
But you have to believe me

307
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
in this matter.

308
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,600
Are you so sure?

309
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
Su Qingqing is in danger.

310
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,600
Who's there?

311
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,600
The Chief's order is here.

312
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,600
Open the door quickly.

313
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
Open the door.

314
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
The Saintess of the Su family went in to announce.

315
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
She hasn't left for a day.

316
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Have you ever been in and checked?

317
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,600
I'm guilty.

318
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
Please forgive me.

319
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
After we were ordered

320
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
to guard the Su family village,

321
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
we were ordered

322
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
not to enter the Su family village without permission.

323
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
They said it was because the Su family had a magic trick.

324
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
They were afraid that we would be confused

325
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,600
and let the sinners go.

326
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
They are not

327
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,600
any sinners now.

328
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
You're right.

329
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
I'm sorry.

330
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
The people of the Su family have never come out.

331
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
You've never been in either.

332
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
I've been there six or seven years ago.

333
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,600
But they can't speak.

334
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,600
They only know how to knock on the door.

335
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,600
They seem to want to escape.

336
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
As the guards,

337
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
we were so angry that we didn't listen to the warning

338
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
and had to shoot these people.

339
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,600
What do you mean by saying that they can't speak?

340
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
After that, we checked the corpses

341
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
and found that their tongues

342
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
were cut off.

343
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
The tongues were pulled out.

344
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
Someone doesn't want the people of the Su family

345
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,600
to talk.

346
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
Tell your people to get dressed up

347
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
and follow us immediately.

348
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,600
Yes.

349
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
Open the door.

350
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
Yes.

351
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
What's going on?

352
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
It's like a deserted village

353
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,600
that has been empty for a long time.

354
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Where are the people of the Su family?

355
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,600
I don't know.

356
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
I'll take someone to investigate here.

357
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
You, take someone over there.

358
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,600
Yes.

359
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Others, follow me.

360
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Yes.

361
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Brother Xing, Brother Chong,

362
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
let's go investigate everywhere.

363
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Why are there so many bones on this tree?

364
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,600
I've seen this bone before.

365
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
I've also asked my mother.

366
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
But she just said

367
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,600
that this bone was a ritual object

368
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
of ancestors many years ago.

369
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
It's not much.

370
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Mr. Gu, it's bad.

371
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
What's wrong?

372
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
Sir,

373
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
we found a woman's corpse in front of us.

374
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
Where?

375
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,600
Take me there.

376
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Yes.

377
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
Did you find out

378
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
where these women come from?

379
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
They should be from the Su family.

380
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
The corpse?

381
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,600
It's a cold-blooded person.

382
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,600
And

383
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,600
their heads have been peeled off.

384
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,600
Their tongues have been pulled out.

385
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,600
Their heads have been peeled off.

386
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Isn't that the same with that old...

387
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
Mr. Xingjia, what do you want to say?

388
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
The head and the fatal wound are interlocked.

389
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
It's a heart injury.

390
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,600
The tongue is a long-standing injury.

391
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
How could it be?

392
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,600
It's a heart injury.

393
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
Who's there?

394
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
Don't kill me!

395
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
Don't kill me!

396
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
Don't kill me!

397
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
Don't kill me!

398
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,600
Don't kill me!

399
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,600
What's with the old woman?

400
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
Don't kill me!

401
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
Don't kill me!

402
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
Don't kill me!

403
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,600
Don't kill me!

404
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
Don't kill me!

405
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,600
Don't kill me!

406
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
Don't kill me!

407
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
Don't kill me!

408
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
Don't kill me!

409
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,600
The beautiful woman is beautiful

410
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
and her form is lovely.

411
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,600
She is as gentle as a spring.

412
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,600
The spring brings me to the river

413
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,600
to get some food

414
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,600
and to make up for my sins.

415
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Don't catch me!

416
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,600
Don't catch me!

417
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,600
Who's going to catch you, Pupo?

418
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,600
The monster!

419
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,600
The monster with eight bodies!

420
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
What monster?

421
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
Where is it?

422
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,600
It's in this forest.

423
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,600
There are many in this forest!

424
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,600
Don't eat me!

425
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,600
Is this old woman crazy?

426
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,600
What nonsense is she talking about?

427
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,600
Don't eat me!

428
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,600
Mine?

429
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
Give it back to me!

430
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,600
The beautiful woman is beautiful

431
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,600
Give it back to me!

432
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,600
and her form is lovely.

433
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
Give it back to me!

434
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
She is as gentle as a spring

435
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,600
but she is as gentle as a river.

436
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
She is as gentle as a spring

437
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,600
Give it back to me!

438
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
and her bones are strong.

439
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
Stop pretending.

440
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,600
You are not crazy.

441
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,600
Tell me.

442
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,600
Why are you pretending to be crazy?

443
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,600
Where did you hear that song?

444
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,600
The one who knows this song

445
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
should be gone.

446
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,600
I have my own way.

447
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
Tell me

448
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,600
who you are.

449
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,600
I wonder who this young man is.

450
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
He is the son of the Marquis of South Du Nanbo.

451
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
His identity is noble.

452
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,600
How can he tell you his name?

453
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,600
South Du?

454
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,600
How could he?

455
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,600
How could he think like that?

456
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
Why are you talking so much?

457
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,600
Tell me who you are.

458
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
Why are you peeping at me?

459
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
Is this a murder case?

460
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
Is it related to you?

461
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,600
They are my family.

462
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
You said

463
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,600
it had nothing to do with me.

464
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,600
What happened here?

465
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,600
What happened?

466
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,600
I am Su Zhen.

467
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,600
I am from the Su family.

468
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,600
Granny Su

469
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,600
can you tell us

470
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,600
where the Su family is now?

471
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
Where are they now?

472
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,600
They are all dead.

473
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
A few years ago

474
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
the family of Kun was destroyed.

475
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
The whole family of Yongsu was imprisoned here.

476
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,600
Not long after

477
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,600
a group of Yis came.

478
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
They killed all the men

479
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,600
and only left the women.

480
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,600
They even cut off

481
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,600
the women's tongues

482
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,600
to let them raise

483
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,600
the young girls.

484
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,600
When the girls were 16 years old

485
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,600
they took them

486
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,600
to the mountains

487
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,600
and never came back.

488
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,600
Today

489
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,600
the last group of girls

490
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,600
were taken to Qingluan Mountain.

491
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,600
Qingluan Mountain.

492
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,600
Granny Su

493
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,600
have you seen a young woman

494
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
who came to the Su family?

495
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,600
What young woman?

496
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,600
Young woman?

497
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
She left the country yesterday

498
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,600
and sent a messenger to the Su family.

499
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,600
But she hasn't returned yet.

500
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,600
So we came to look for her.

501
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,600
What did you say?

502
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
She left the country

503
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,600
because she is a fake

504
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
and a fake beast.

505
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,600
Shut up.

506
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,600
The country's master is kind.

507
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,600
How can you slander him?

508
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
You insulted the country's master.

509
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,600
Kill the snake.

510
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
Stop.

511
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,600
You bullied the old man.

512
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,600
This is the way

513
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,600
the country's master treats the people.

514
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,600
Young Master

515
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,600
aren't you looking for someone?

516
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,600
I know where she is.

517
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,600
You know where she is?

518
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,600
Since this woman

519
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,600
disappeared in the Su Village

520
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
she must have gone to a place.

521
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,600
What place?

522
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,600
Qingluan Mountain.

523
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,600
Yin Yang East.

524
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,760
Yin Yang East

525
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,680
Young lady young lady

526
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,680
Wake up.

527
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,680
Wake up.

528
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,680
Su's Mansion

529
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,680
Granny Su, how far are we?

530
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,680
We've passed this path.

531
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,680
There's Yin-Yang Cave ahead.

532
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,680
Why don't you let Gu Xi go with us?

533
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,680
Let her stay.

534
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,680
Granny Su is not right.

535
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,680
Of course.

536
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,680
If she says that

537
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,680
there's a tribe in the village controlling us,

538
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,680
I don't believe it.

539
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,680
Why is she so rich?

540
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,680
Everyone in the village suffers.

541
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,680
She's the only one with a family name.

542
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,680
Granny Su shouldn't be

543
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,680
involved in the death of the tribe.

544
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
You know her?

545
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,680
When she was young,

546
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,680
she was very good to Qingqing.

547
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,680
Qingqing and I

548
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,680
have to call her Granny.

549
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,680
It's also an endless cycle.

550
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,680
It's an endless cycle.

551
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,680
Yes.

552
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,680
Just as you said,

553
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,680
it's an endless cycle.

554
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,680
What happened in the village

555
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,680
in seven years?

556
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,680
We don't know.

557
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,680
Granny Su.

558
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,680
Granny Su.

559
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,680
Granny Su.

560
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,680
Granny Su.

561
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,680
Granny Su.

562
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,680
Granny Su.

563
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,680
Did this old woman

564
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,680
play tricks on us?

565
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,680
Brother Jiang, what should we do?

566
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,680
Wait.

567
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,680
Granny Su.

568
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,680
Granny Su.

569
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,680
Gu Sheng.

570
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,680
Granny Su.

571
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,680
Si.

572
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,680
Why are you here?

573
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,680
I'm here to find you.

574
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,680
