1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,280
Let's leave

2
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:18,000
We want to keep shouting

3
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,820
Chong Monkey Chancellor

4
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,840
Episode 13

5
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,260
上主人

6
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,260
They are my old subordinates

7
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,260
Great

8
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,260
My Kun's army

9
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,260
has no relatives

10
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,260
Brother Jiang

11
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,260
Get up

12
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,260
I heard it right, right?

13
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,260
You check it

14
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,260
He said these people

15
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,260
are not people, but ghosts

16
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,260
He wanted to bite us just now

17
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,260
Calm down

18
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,260
Brother He Shen

19
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,260
No

20
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,260
Kun Wu's old subordinates

21
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,260
Are you awake now?

22
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,260
I'm fine

23
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,260
Are you awake now?

24
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,260
Who knows these monsters

25
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,260
When will they come back?

26
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,260
What do you plan to do?

27
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,260
Young master

28
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,260
I didn't expect so many years

29
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,260
I can see you again

30
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,260
If the general is in heaven

31
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,260
I'm finally at ease

32
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,260
Uncle Lin

33
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,260
What happened just now?

34
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,260
The living are moving

35
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,260
I want to scare them away

36
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,260
I'm scared

37
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,260
That little saint girl

38
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,260
Uncle Lin, don't worry

39
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,260
I've already seen Qingqing

40
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,260
when I come back

41
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,260
She is safe now

42
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,260
That's good

43
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,260
Young master

44
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,260
Take the little saint girl away

45
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,260
The farther the better

46
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,260
Uncle Lin

47
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,260
It's really good

48
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,260
The general asked me

49
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,260
to tell you before he died

50
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,260
If you meet the young master

51
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,260
in your lifetime

52
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,260
You must tell the young master

53
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,260
Take the little saint girl

54
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,260
Never step into the Zhongli

55
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,260
It's better to hide and hide

56
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,260
and leave far away

57
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,260
Don't be afraid of the Kun family

58
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,260
I can't turn against them

59
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,260
Why?

60
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,260
The Kun family is a powerful country

61
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,260
Why can't we turn against them?

62
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,260
Is it true

63
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,260
that the rumor was true?

64
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,260
Of course not

65
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,260
Why, Uncle Lin?

66
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,260
Even you and me

67
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,260
can't find the truth for the Kun family

68
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,260
If you can't find the truth

69
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,260
Then my father, mother

70
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,260
and the dead Kun family

71
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,260
will only become

72
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,260
the innocent souls

73
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,260
who have been accused for thousands of years

74
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,260
I'm begging you

75
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,260
Tell me

76
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,260
What happened that year?

77
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,260
The general

78
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,260
Young master

79
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,260
I can't stand this big gift

80
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,260
Actually

81
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,260
Not that the general

82
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,260
didn't want to tell you

83
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,260
But the thing that happened that year

84
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,260
is really too cruel

85
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,260
and too strange

86
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,260
Do you still remember the night of the new year

87
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,260
when the general Kun called for the entrance?

88
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,260
Of course I remember

89
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,260
Not long after

90
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,260
I was worried about my father's condition

91
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,260
and rushed into the palace with him.

92
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,260
But that night,

93
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,260
I never came back.

94
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,260
That year, it was cold and cold.

95
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,260
I heard that that night,

96
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,260
you were guarding the hall of Zhong Likong.

97
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,260
But you never saw the little prince.

98
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,260
Unexpectedly,

99
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,260
you couldn't help but

100
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,260
break into the palace

101
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,260
and ask to see the little prince.

102
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,260
But who would have thought

103
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,260
that the one locked in the bedroom

104
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,260
was not the prince,

105
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,260
but your mother,

106
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,260
the Saintess Su Ying.

107
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,260
Ying'er, what's wrong with you?

108
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,260
Ying'er,

109
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,260
how did you become like this?

110
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,260
Ying'er.

111
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,260
Ying'er.

112
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,260
Ying'er.

113
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,260
Wake up.

114
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,260
Look at me.

115
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,260
I'm your husband.

116
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,260
Husband.

117
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,260
Ying'er.

118
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,260
Husband.

119
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,260
I...

120
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,260
I found that thing.

121
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,260
I found that

122
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,260
the world was going to be in chaos.

123
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,260
I found that

124
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,260
the Saintess was not ready.

125
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,260
Father killed Qingqing.

126
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,260
Killed Qingqing.

127
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,260
Killed Qingqing.

128
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,260
What happened later?

129
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,260
Why did everyone say

130
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,260
that my grandfather killed my mother?

131
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,260
I heard that before my wife died,

132
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,260
the general took advantage of himself

133
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,260
and turned into a monster.

134
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,260
He cut off his head

135
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,260
to free himself.

136
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,260
The general couldn't bear

137
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,260
his wife's suffering,

138
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,260
so he had to take the risk.

139
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,260
Since then,

140
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,260
the state preceptor has used the crime

141
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,260
of murdering the Saintess,

142
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,260
to kill the general on the spot.

143
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,260
But I don't understand.

144
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,260
Mother always loves her relatives.

145
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,260
Why did she do that?

146
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,260
I don't know.

147
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,260
But you shouldn't blame the Saintess.

148
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,260
The general said that

149
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,260
there must be a reason.

150
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,260
What a terrible thing

151
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,260
that could make mother

152
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,260
give up her own daughter.

153
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,260
What is the Heaven's punishment?

154
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,260
That thing.

155
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,260
What is it?

156
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,260
The thing that the Saintess said,

157
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,260
I might know what it is.

158
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,260
The day of the coup,

159
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,260
I remember that

160
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,260
some people became

161
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,260
the monster in the wife's mouth,

162
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,260
while some people didn't.

163
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,260
On the New Year's Eve,

164
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,260
we agreed at the same time.

165
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,260
The only difference

166
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,260
is that we,

167
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,260
drank the well water in the mansion.

168
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,260
Well water?

169
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,260
I guessed that

170
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,260
the well water was released by someone,

171
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,260
which caused the person who drank the well water

172
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,260
to die of the blood of the emperor.

173
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,260
What do you mean by that?

174
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,260
Why are you so silent?

175
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,260
You...

176
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,260
No heartbeat.

177
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,260
No heartbeat?

178
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,260
How can you jump around?

179
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,260
I didn't hear anything.

180
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,260
The soldiers who were poisoned

181
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,260
were all in the city of Xinmai.

182
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,260
Young master,

183
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,260
this is really complicated

184
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,260
and dangerous.

185
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,260
If you don't be careful,

186
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,260
you will be killed.

187
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,260
You and the Saintess

188
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,260
are the last blood of the general.

189
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,260
Don't risk it again.

190
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,260
Don't be late.

191
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,260
I'll send you out now.

192
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,260
Wait.

193
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,260
I have something to ask you.

194
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,260
General Lin,

195
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,260
have you heard of the

196
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,260
Immortal Medicine of Evergreen in the valley?

197
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,260
Immortal Medicine of Evergreen?

198
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,260
I haven't heard of it.

199
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,260
Who are you?

200
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,260
Why are you here?

201
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,260
They are my brothers

202
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,260
who were born and died

203
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,260
in the Eastland.

204
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,260
Don't worry, uncle Lin.

205
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,260
You said there was an exit here.

206
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,260
Why

207
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,260
are you still trapped here for many years?

208
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,260
Follow me.

209
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,260
Back then,

210
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,260
we were chased by the demon master.

211
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,260
We wanted to attack the palace

212
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,260
and avenge the general.

213
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,260
But the evil master

214
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,260
was spreading rumors

215
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,260
that Kun's army was attacked by the Heaven

216
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,260
and became a monster.

217
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,260
We were afraid that we would ruin

218
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,260
the glory of Kun's army.

219
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,260
So we hid in this tomb.

220
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,260
This is...

221
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,260
This is the ancient poem.

222
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,260
When we arrived here,

223
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,260
we were here.

224
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,260
Is this poem

225
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,260
the body of the immortal?

226
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,260
This...

227
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,260
Isn't this the crystal stone of the Eastland?

228
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,260
Don't touch it. It's dangerous.

229
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,260
This crystal stone is harmless to you.

230
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,260
I see.

231
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,260
It seems that

232
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,260
only we who are poisoned

233
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,260
will be hurt by this crystal stone.

234
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,260
So,

235
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,260
this crystal stone can hurt you?

236
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,260
That's right.

237
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,260
Because of this crystal stone,

238
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,260
we lost many brothers.

239
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,260
This crystal stone

240
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,260
is actually very strange.

241
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,260
What are you doing again?

242
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,260
This...

243
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,260
This monster has a headscarf.

244
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,260
You see,

245
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,260
so many of the immortal

246
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,260
have turned into monsters.

247
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,260
They don't even have a headscarf.

248
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,260
This is the end.

249
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,260
Kun,

250
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,260
what did the immortal

251
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,260
of the Sui clan

252
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,260
do

253
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,260
to end up like this?

254
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,260
You remember

255
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,260
what I told you before.

256
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,260
Before mother passed away,

257
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,260
I told Qingqing

258
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,260
to burn the mountain

259
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,260
and bury the body in the ground.

260
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,260
So,

261
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,260
why did mother

262
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,260
tell Qingqing

263
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,260
to burn the mountain

264
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,260
and bury the body in the ground?

265
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,260
Unless...

266
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,260
Unless the body of the saint girl

267
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,260
is useful.

268
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,260
It must be.

269
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,260
Young Master,

270
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,260
it's getting late.

271
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,260
If you want to go out,

272
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,260
you'd better go earlier.

273
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,260
Let's go.

274
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,260
There are too many monsters here.

275
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,260
It's not good to stay here.

276
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,260
Let's go.

277
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,260
Take it

278
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,260
and send it to the mountain.

279
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,260
Yes.

280
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,260
The death of the crown prince

281
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,260
and the death of the emperor

282
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,260
are not good enough to save the emperor.

283
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,260
The day

284
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,260
when this memorial is in the hands

285
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,260
is the day

286
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,260
when your king of Zhongli

287
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,260
will die.

288
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,260
Don't think that

289
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,260
you can forget the truth

290
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,260
after you find Qingyuan Mountain.

291
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,260
Since you are here,

292
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,260
don't think about going out alive.

293
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,260
The terrain of Qingyuan Mountain

294
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,260
is really complicated.

295
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,260
Yes.

296
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,260
We've been walking for so long

297
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,260
and we haven't found the way back.

298
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,260
Someone is there.

299
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,260
Hurry up.

300
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,260
I need orders.

301
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,260
Block the Qingyuan Mountain.

302
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,260
You go over there.

303
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,260
Yes.

304
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,260
I didn't expect Zhongli State

305
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,260
to be so vicious.

306
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,260
They tricked us

307
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,260
into hiding in the mountain.

308
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,260
I wonder how Jiang Xiong and the others are doing.

309
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,260
Jiang Xiong and the others are very busy.

310
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,260
They have their own world.

311
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,260
They should be fine.

312
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,260
We should go back

313
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,260
and find a place

314
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,260
to settle down.

315
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,260
Then we'll send someone to find them.

316
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,260
The state has blocked the whole Qingyuan Mountain.

317
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,260
I'm afraid we can't go out.

318
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,260
It seems that

319
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,260
the most dangerous place

320
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,260
is the safest place.

321
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,260
We can only hide in the mountain.

322
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,260
We'll make plans

323
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,260
when we meet Jiang Xiong and the others.

324
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,260
But we have so many people.

325
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,260
How can we hide?

326
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,260
Brothers,

327
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,260
I know that there is a abandoned

328
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,260
old house in Qingyuan Mountain.

329
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,260
How about going there first?

330
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,260
This lady and Brother Eushun are here.

331
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,260
May I ask who she is?

332
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,260
She is my friend.

333
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,260
I trust her.

334
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,260
Let's go.

335
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,260
Young Master,

336
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,260
the sky is the exit.

337
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,260
The stone wall is broken.

338
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,260
We can't go up.

339
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,260
This is the Lin's house.

340
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,260
I'm afraid it's not easy.

341
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,260
The exit is just a few meters away.

342
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,260
We must go there.

343
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,260
Eushun,

344
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,260
take them out first.

345
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,260
Put down the rope.

346
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,260
Let them go up.

347
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,260
And,

348
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,260
be careful of the crystal stones on the ground.

349
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,260
Go.

350
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,260
Spirits, keep watching.

351
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,260
Catch him,

352
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,960
turn him around.

353
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,340
Ahcau.

354
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,840
Attendant Song,

355
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,440
you've been almost to the tone for a picture.

356
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,900
You look worried this morning.

357
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,320
Sachen Guo,

358
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,920
you please talk to me again.

359
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,120
After I fully Москв 나왔�imbap,

360
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,320
is there anyone else what should we do?

361
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,080
Please go to bed.

362
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,800
My head is . . .

363
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,260
What?

364
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,600
Thank you.

365
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,120
He will be back soon.

366
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,220
You can edge here.

367
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,140
All right, I can stay here.

368
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,460
Noisiness calls.

369
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,720
Dad.

370
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,700
Yeah!

371
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,980
Stop crying!

372
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,300
Dad

373
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,860
you can't go lying in jail anymore!

374
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,660
Brother Jiang, come up.

375
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,580
You're the only one left.

376
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,420
I'm fine.

377
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,860
I'll go up now.

378
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,380
Yang Wenhui!

379
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,860
Why aren't you coming up?

380
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,180
What happened to your hand?

381
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,580
What happened to your hand?

382
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,900
I'll go up to pick you up.

383
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,820
Your wound...

384
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,780
I ran into him when I was fighting with Kun's army.

385
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,740
It's just a small injury. It's fine.

386
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,900
Only those who are poisoned by us

387
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,620
will be hurt by this crystal stone.

388
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,180
Uncle Lin!

389
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,500
Brother Jiang's wound was covered by the crystal stone.

390
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,180
Have you seen such a injury?

391
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,180
Could it be that

392
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,580
when Mr. Jiang was fighting with us,

393
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,780
he was injured

394
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,780
and his wound was poisoned,

395
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,980
but he was turned into a corpse by the crystal stone?

396
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,580
Stay away from me.

397
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,380
This is strange.

398
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,180
Be careful not to hurt yourself.

399
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,180
I'm fine.

400
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,180
Why didn't you tell me earlier that you were injured?

401
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,780
This place is not safe.

402
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,380
I'm just a minor injury.

403
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,580
I can handle it myself.

404
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,780
Brother Jiang, hang in there!

405
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,580
Brother Chong and I will go down right away!

406
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,580
Be careful!

407
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,580
Oh no!

408
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,780
The equipment is in danger.

409
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,380
Where did these bandits come from?

410
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,980
This is the palace's guard room.

411
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,380
It's that stone again.

412
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,380
It's that stone again.

413
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,180
The Tiger Tribe is bullying you, right?

414
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,180
Get them, Mr. Jiang!

415
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,180
Kang Jiangguang,

416
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,980
the stone is at the entrance.

417
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,180
Go up and help them.

418
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,580
Let's go together.

419
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,380
You're going out alone.

420
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,580
It's possible that...

421
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,580
I'll carry you.

422
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,980
You're crazy.

423
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,580
You can't get out with me.

424
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,780
It's a rumor.

425
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,380
It's too much now.

426
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,980
I can't carry anyone.

427
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,380
Let go.

428
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,780
No.

429
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,580
You stupid, let me go!

430
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,780
I saved you because I'm willing to be a hero.

431
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,180
I'm willing to owe you.

432
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,580
I'll let you remember my kindness to you forever.

433
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,980
Who cares about your saving me?

434
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,580
Let me go!

435
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,380
If you really have a good idea,

436
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,980
I'll teach you how to make a living.

437
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,380
Jiangguangguang,

438
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,980
if you want to live,

439
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,980
then you must live!

440
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,180
You're right.

441
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,380
It's more interesting if you live.

442
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,180
Go.

443
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,180
Wait!

444
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,980
Be careful of ambushes.

445
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,380
Thanks to Young Master,

446
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,780
we have this day.

447
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,580
This is my duty.

448
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:26,980
I should thank you.

449
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,180
I should thank these princes.

450
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,180
I offended you a lot.

451
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,380
I thank you for your goodwill.

452
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,780
You helped us escape from the heaven.

453
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,180
You also risked your life to protect us.

454
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,180
I and Kun's army will remember your kindness.

455
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,780
Senior, don't be like this.

456
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,780
You're too polite.

457
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,180
I'm sorry.

458
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,180
Uncle Lin,

459
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,780
you...

460
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,180
Under the cave,

461
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,380
Young Master is brave and resourceful.

462
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,380
He never gives up on anyone in danger.

463
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,180
This is the way our Kun's army

464
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,780
should follow.

465
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,180
I was wrong.

466
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,780
I was the child of the soul-guarding soul

467
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,780
that needed protection.

468
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,780
I was the strong man of Kun's family.

469
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,780
Uncle Lin.

470
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,780
Young Master!

471
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,780
I want to give you the military badge.

472
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,580
If you want to return to the forest,

473
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,580
we will follow you everywhere.

474
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,780
If you want to recruit Kun's family,

475
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,380
we will go to the end of the world with you.

476
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,780
We will live and die together.

477
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,980
Young Master,

478
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,380
Kun's army will follow you to the end of the world.

479
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,580
husband,

480
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,380
Brother Jiang.

481
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,520
go and order 100 warships quick

482
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,860
yes

483
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,300
the

484
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,600
Surge of Zhongli came to the capital

485
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,180
and caused a new disaster

486
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,940
but now they're all safe

487
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,060
Your majesty, should we go and get the Parents to come back?

488
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,520
come back?

489
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,860
Once we leave Zhongli

490
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,340
there's no turning back

491
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,820
Since we haven't seen the return of the utan

492
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,980
No matter what,

493
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,380
Zhong Liyuan, this idiot,

494
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,940
can't get my palm.

495
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,300
Your Majesty is powerful.

496
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,660
You can definitely achieve great things.

497
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:56,700
By the way,

498
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,180
how is the arrangement of the troops of Mount Qingluan?

499
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,580
The ten miles of Mount Qingluan

500
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,540
and the road to the forbidden area

501
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,740
are all under our control.

502
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,220
Once they show up,

503
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,460
we will be in danger.

504
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,500
Good.

505
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,820
We can't let them come back alive.

506
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,780
Little girl,

507
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,780
where am I?

508
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,420
This is the old house of Mount Qingluan.

509
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,980
Why are they all here?

510
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,180
Brother Jiang.

511
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,620
My brother Jiang.

512
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,100
I almost thought

513
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,100
I almost thought

514
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,620
you are a genius and a man of great fortune.

515
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,780
I thought you were a young man

516
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,380
and you were a man of great fortune.

517
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,780
We black-haired people are black-haired people.

518
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,180
If you have a good life,

519
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,260
what should we do?

520
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,700
Why are you and Yi Yao here?

521
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,620
Brother Jiang, you don't know.

522
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:02,980
The whole Mount Qingluan

523
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,580
is controlled by the Zhongli Army.

524
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,340
Even the road to the forbidden area

525
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,060
is guarded by Zhongli Army's heavy troops.

526
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,220
Fortunately, this girl told us

527
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,660
that the people in the back hill are rare.

528
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,860
There are abandoned old houses

529
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,940
that can be used to hide.

530
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,820
That's why we are here.

531
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,300
The State Preceptor has been searching in the mountains.

532
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,700
But we are very remote here.

533
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,220
So we didn't find it.

534
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,980
To avoid the State Preceptor's eyes,

535
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,180
we can only

536
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,540
secretly find you in Mount Qingluan.

537
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,620
It seems that

538
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,500
Xian Xuanji is going to kill us

539
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,580
in Mount Qingluan.

540
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,820
If we are so bold,

541
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,140
we will be rebelled.

542
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,180
Come here.

543
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,020
Come here.

544
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:19,740
Hurry!

545
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,500
Get down.

546
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,140
Let it go.

547
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,860
State Preceptor,

548
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:38,580
you...

549
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,340
Why are you so.

550
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,100
Your Lordship Zhongli Yuan

551
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,860
the constitutions leader of pois.

552
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,100
But their true business

553
00:26:52,100 --> 00:27:07,860
is devoid of filial piety towards the assassins' 200

554
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,140
Your Lordship

555
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,380
You asked the Crown Prince to enter Mount Qingluan

556
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,540
All the imperial edicts

557
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,420
were passed by you, State Preceptor

558
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,580
State Preceptor, why are you here?

559
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,900
I will listen to you

560
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,740
State Preceptor, why are you here?

561
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,700
Put the traitor Zhong Liyuan in the harem

562
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,420
Don't step out

563
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,860
State Preceptor, let me go

564
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,980
Let me go

565
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,700
State Preceptor, let me go

566
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,580
Let me go

567
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,060
I will listen to you

568
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,020
State Preceptor

569
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,100
State Preceptor

570
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,660
State Preceptor Zhong Liyuan

571
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:02,060
murdered the envoy of Mount Shang

572
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,580
He is a traitor

573
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,780
I will supervise the state personally

574
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,620
State Preceptor is unrighteous

575
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,460
I will take the responsibility

576
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,740
From today on

577
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,820
I am the king of Zhongli

578
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,980
State Preceptor is wise and the blessing of Zhongli

579
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,260
I didn't expect the State Preceptor

580
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,500
who killed the vassal

581
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,180
We are not only safe

582
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,660
but also saved Deputy General Lin

583
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,820
Deputy General Lin and them

584
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,820
Well, those weirdos

585
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,500
Brother Eishun has told us the origin

586
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,380
I think they listen to Brother Eishun

587
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,300
As long as they don't cause trouble

588
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,580
We will not make it difficult for them

589
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,580
Please help me to pick up the medicine

590
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,460
Don't tell the other brothers of the Crown Prince Camp

591
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,340
I told Uncle Lin about the grievance

592
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,300
But I didn't tell him about my relationship with the Kun family

593
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,340
I only said that I saved them in the underground city

594
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,060
They are grateful

595
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,260
Now they are mainly under my care

596
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,420
Don't worry

597
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,660
Uncle Lin has a sense

598
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,980
He will help me

599
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,220
I will go to the capital

600
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,340
I will go to the capital

601
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,780
I will go to the capital

602
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,180
I will go to the capital

603
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,380
You will help me to hide it

604
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,700
It's not a long-term plan

605
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,980
One day

606
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,940
your identity will be exposed

607
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,660
As a man of the Kun family

608
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,780
I have no regrets

609
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,380
If that day really comes

610
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,020
I will take the responsibility of my father

611
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:03,620
OK

612
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,820
Until that day

613
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,820
I will do my best to help you

614
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,780
But this is really strange

615
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,420
If the state-owned country kills us

616
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,380
How to explain to the king

617
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,180
Are you not afraid of running away from the mountain

618
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,140
Brother Jiang, bad news

619
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,020
I saw Zhongli's soldiers on the mountain

620
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,100
I secretly heard thepreneuse before God

621
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,100
Followed the search to brat The Eagle

622
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,460
Kill whatever you can

623
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:13,640
The most indulging life for young man in daytime

624
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,540
It's always my wishful thinking

625
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,080
Dimension Summoning
