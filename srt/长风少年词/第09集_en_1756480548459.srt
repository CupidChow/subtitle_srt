1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,160
We since our childhood loved each other non-stop

2
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,760
Never Warmed by Sweet Fate

3
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,200
Just so we could satisfy each other

4
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,540
Never had stopped before the dawn

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 16

6
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,720
You really saw the scar on his chest?

7
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,440
He was badly hurt.

8
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,320
How much do you hate him for hurting him so badly?

9
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,840
I guess I do.

10
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,880
Come and have a look.

11
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,480
Come and have a look.

12
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,000
Come and have a look.

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,280
Over there.

14
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,800
Come and have a look.

15
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,080
Over there.

16
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,600
Come and have a look.

17
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,920
Come on.

18
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,040
Come and have a look.

19
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,720
Come and have a look.

20
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,720
So beautiful.

21
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,160
It's a monk.

22
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,160
So beautiful.

23
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,880
So beautiful.

24
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,920
So beautiful.

25
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,360
Yeah.

26
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,360
You look so beautiful.

27
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,360
So beautiful.

28
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,480
So beautiful.

29
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,160
So beautiful.

30
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,160
I thought it was a water temple.

31
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,280
So beautiful.

32
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,240
So beautiful.

33
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,600
Yeah.

34
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,240
It's like a Buddha statue.

35
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,360
Yeah.

36
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,360
So beautiful.

37
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,680
So beautiful.

38
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,160
So beautiful.

39
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,760
So beautiful.

40
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,600
So beautiful.

41
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,400
So beautiful.

42
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,280
Come.

43
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,060
Brother Yuan capabilities.

44
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,320
Come.

45
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,760
Take it.

46
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,660
Take it.

47
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,840
Take it.

48
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,400
It'szw letting us

49
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,800
try a few different brands.

50
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,820
Be careful with it.

51
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,500
Nope.

52
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,500
Tengeg Tianshen's Krishna

53
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,560
is good, too.

54
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,040
It doesn't matter if I blue some trash

55
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,920
What should I do

56
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,560
I'll pston you

57
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,760
I'll come back

58
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,580
What can I do

59
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,980
Should I wait for you

60
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,000
You said you will follow him

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,120
I didn't mean that

62
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,600
Maybe just stop

63
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,160
What can you do

64
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,320
What can I do

65
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,020
Come back

66
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,740
ooooo

67
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,080
Hurry up

68
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,700
I'm gonna take a minute

69
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:02,920
Be calm

70
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,280
Come out

71
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:04,660
What's going on

72
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,660
Probably

73
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,380
Maybe

74
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,260
Someday

75
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:07,920
I think

76
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,720
maybe

77
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,180
Maybe

78
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,140
I'll talk you a wife

79
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,960
What other wife

80
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,720
Don't think so

81
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,780
What else

82
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,660
I just wanted

83
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,660
Yes.

84
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,580
Today,

85
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,380
I will definitely help you

86
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,180
take what you took from Brother Chuang.

87
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,500
Today, you are my enemy.

88
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,980
Then, I, Duke Nanbo,

89
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,620
will definitely be your enemy.

90
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,620
Your Highness,

91
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,620
we have a long way to go.

92
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,620
This is bad!

93
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,620
Second Young Master has gone mad!

94
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,620
What did you do to him again?

95
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,620
You want to die?

96
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,620
Do you want to rebel?

97
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,620
Duke Bei,

98
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,620
your son took my woman and took my throne.

99
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,620
He can just drive me to the end.

100
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,620
But he should not

101
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,620
use his dirty hands

102
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,620
to trample on my mother's place of peace.

103
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,620
He even wouldn't even let go of an innocent child.

104
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,620
Father,

105
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,620
do you know that

106
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,620
that child promised me

107
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,620
that when he grows up,

108
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,620
he will personally shoot a black eagle

109
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,620
and return it to me?

110
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,620
Unfortunately, he has no such chance anymore.

111
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,620
Father,

112
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,620
are you asking me if I want to rebel?

113
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,620
Yes.

114
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,620
Today, I am going to create this mortal world

115
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,620
and let you taste

116
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,620
what is called the pain of losing a son.

117
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,620
No!

118
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,620
How dare you!

119
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,620
You bastard!

120
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,620
Are you crazy?

121
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,620
What are you doing?

122
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,620
Come with me.

123
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,620
Come on, stop her!

124
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,620
Stop her!

125
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,620
Bastard.

126
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,620
I don't want you to die with them.

127
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,620
I will die for you.

128
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,620
What did you say?

129
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,620
Why do you have to stand on their side?

130
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,620
After that,

131
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,620
I was in a coma for the rest of my life.

132
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,620
I was sent back to Nandu.

133
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,620
I finally survived,

134
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,620
but I was also in a coma.

135
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,620
Brother Chong and I

136
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,620
have not contacted each other since then.

137
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,620
We only knew that the Crown Prince had met again.

138
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,620
If that day,

139
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,620
I didn't help him to get over that,

140
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,620
he would be charged with the crime of losing his brother forever.

141
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,620
And now that I have fallen into this world,

142
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,620
I have never regretted it.

143
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,620
But I will never go back to the past

144
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,620
between me and Brother Chong.

145
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,620
I have another question.

146
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,620
Why did you suddenly

147
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,620
use magic and use the sword?

148
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,620
Why don't you know Brother Chong's fighting techniques?

149
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,620
Why...

150
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,620
After I fell ill,

151
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,620
I am not as good as before.

152
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,620
It's like the fighting techniques before.

153
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,620
I really can't do it.

154
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,620
My father saw that I was weak,

155
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,620
and worried that I would be killed by someone in the future.

156
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,620
So he invited a famous master in the world

157
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,620
to teach me the magic of riding and shooting.

158
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,620
And then...

159
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,620
And then at a critical time,

160
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,620
he saved my life.

161
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,620
He kept everything secret.

162
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,620
I didn't expect that

163
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,620
you and Brother Chong

164
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,620
would have such a common desire.

165
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,620
I'm sorry.

166
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,620
I was too harsh just now.

167
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,620
You are so considerate.

168
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,620
I am not suspicious of you.

169
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,620
Brother Chong tried to test you.

170
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,620
You should be responsible for your behavior.

171
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,620
I have nothing to say.

172
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,620
You...

173
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,620
You know everything?

174
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,620
But I am curious

175
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,620
when did Mr. Jiang

176
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,620
suspect me?

177
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,620
When we were brothers,

178
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,620
when we were drinking and having fun,

179
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,620
or when you said

180
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,620
when we were in trouble,

181
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,620
and when we were separated,

182
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,620
you were so bold to test me.

183
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,620
No.

184
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,620
I really thought you were my friend.

185
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,620
I...

186
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,620
I'll do it myself.

187
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,620
All these days,

188
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,620
I have been waiting for you

189
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,620
to be my friend.

190
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,620
But I never thought...

191
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,620
Forget it.

192
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,620
Maybe it's destiny.

193
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,620
Mr. Jiang.

194
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,620
Thank you for taking care of me for so many months.

195
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,620
Now,

196
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,620
I am so tired

197
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,620
and exhausted.

198
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,620
I don't want to

199
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,620
have any more friends.

200
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,620
I think I don't want to

201
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,620
have any worries

202
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,620
or pain.

203
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,620
Mr. Jiang.

204
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,620
In the future,

205
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,620
we should...

206
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,620
What?

207
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,620
Nonsense.

208
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,620
I don't want to hear it.

209
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,620
Take care of yourself.

210
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,620
I'll leave first.

211
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,620
Mr. Jiang.

212
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,620
I'm sorry.

213
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,620
I'm sorry.

214
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,620
Even if I can solve your doubt for the time being,

215
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,620
it's not a long-term solution.

216
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,620
Mr. Jiang.

217
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,620
You have to stay away from Mr. Jiang.

218
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,620
This is for your own good

219
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,620
and for his own good.

220
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,620
You have an appointment with my son.

221
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,620
My son will try his best

222
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,620
to find your sister.

223
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,620
Mr. Jiang.

224
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,620
If you didn't save me

225
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,620
from danger,

226
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,620
I might have lost my life.

227
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,620
If it wasn't for my fate,

228
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,620
maybe we

229
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,620
would have been

230
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,620
the only ones.

231
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,620
It's my fault.

232
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,620
Jiang Wenhuan.

233
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,620
What?

234
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,620
You're writing a letter to Echun?

235
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,620
You're writing a letter to Echun?

236
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,620
Childe.

237
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,620
What do you mean?

238
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,620
My son

239
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,620
is in the Eastland now.

240
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,620
I can report it to him in person.

241
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,620
Why do you need to send a letter?

242
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,620
The man in the camp

243
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,620
is fake.

244
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,620
Childe Chong,

245
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,620
that's strange.

246
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,620
I don't understand.

247
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,620
Yesterday,

248
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,620
he showed his scar.

249
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,620
I was a little confused.

250
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,620
But if you think about it,

251
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,620
the scar can be forged.

252
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,620
How can he explain

253
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,620
the skill of horse riding?

254
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,620
The most important thing is

255
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,620
that the man in the camp

256
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,620
is not him.

257
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,620
Every time he makes people

258
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,620
feel uncomfortable,

259
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,620
he will make them feel uncomfortable.

260
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,620
Every time he makes people feel uncomfortable,

261
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,620
he will make them feel uncomfortable.

262
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,620
And that boy

263
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,620
is not as bad as him

264
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,620
in tricking people.

265
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,620
Childe Chong,

266
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,620
you are indeed

267
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,620
the person who knows my son best.

268
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,620
He is far away in the South Capital.

269
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,620
He is still making fun of the storm in the Eastland.

270
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,620
What is his purpose?

271
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,620
He is a cheater.

272
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,620
What a big crime!

273
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,620
Is he living in a bad way?

274
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,620
My son

275
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,620
can't come to the camp.

276
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,620
My son can't come to the camp.

277
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,620
Others don't know.

278
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,620
Childe Chong,

279
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,620
you know it yourself.

280
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,620
What do you mean?

281
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,620
Since the incident three years ago,

282
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,620
my son

283
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,620
has been in a bad shape.

284
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,620
He couldn't get up for a long time.

285
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,620
He has been in a bad shape recently.

286
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,620
He is not only

287
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,620
trained by the camp,

288
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,620
but he is also

289
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,620
trained by the camp.

290
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,620
It's not his body

291
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,620
that can withstand the storm.

292
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,620
If he is so useless,

293
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,620
why would he

294
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,620
do such a thing

295
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,620
when the minister didn't come?

296
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,620
If the minister

297
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,620
of the South Marquis Mansion

298
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,620
did this,

299
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,620
wouldn't he tell the world

300
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,620
that the only heir

301
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,620
of the South Capital

302
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,620
is about to die?

303
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,620
Then,

304
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,620
how would the king treat the South Capital?

305
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,620
Would the marquis

306
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,620
be so depressed?

307
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,620
The one who is about to die?

308
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,620
Back then,

309
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,620
don't you know

310
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,620
how serious

311
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,620
my son's injury was?

312
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,620
Whether he can recover

313
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,620
and when he can recover,

314
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,620
no one can be sure.

315
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,620
If you still think

316
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,620
about the past,

317
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,620
please think about

318
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,620
my son.

319
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,620
Don't tell the world about this.

320
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,620
Otherwise,

321
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,620
he will not be able to recover.

322
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,620
Have you received

323
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,620
the letter I sent to Donglu?

324
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,620
I sent it to him a few days ago.

325
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,620
I might have received the letter.

326
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,620
But,

327
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,620
are you sure

328
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,620
you want to tell the truth to him?

329
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,620
It's been so long.

330
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,620
If I keep it from him,

331
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,620
I'm afraid I can't hide it anymore.

332
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,620
Will he help you?

333
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,620
I'm afraid

334
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,620
he will not be able to help me.

335
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,620
I don't know.

336
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,620
My son

337
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,620
asked me

338
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,620
to give this to you.

339
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,620
The flowers in the north.

340
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,620
The military's hearts.

341
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,620
The flowers in the north.

342
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,620
What does he want me to do?

343
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,620
My son

344
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,620
doesn't have any demands on you.

345
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,620
My son said

346
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,620
you were bullied

347
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,620
when you were young.

348
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,620
You were so stubborn.

349
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,620
Now,

350
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,620
you left the north

351
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,620
and the world is in chaos.

352
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,620
He only wants you

353
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,620
to let go

354
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,620
and take over the land.

355
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,620
He doesn't need

356
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,620
to trouble you

357
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,620
with other things.

358
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,620
He just wants you

359
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,620
to be a good son.

360
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,620
It's just a little

361
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,620
selfishness of my son.

362
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,620
I don't dare to force you.

363
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,620
You can decide

364
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,620
everything by yourself.

365
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,620
I have to do this.

366
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,620
My son

367
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,620
For the past three years

368
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,620
you've been drinking bitter medicine

369
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,620
and been punished.

370
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,620
That's why you're still alive.

371
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,620
But

372
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,620
the medicine is very poisonous.

373
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,620
Now you have

374
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,620
a weak qi and blood.

375
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,620
Your body is cold.

376
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,620
You have to

377
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,620
wear a big mask.

378
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,620
I'm not afraid of cold since I was a child.

379
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,620
I can stand the weather

380
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,620
in the north.

381
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,620
He wasn't like this before.

382
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,620
Childe,

383
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,620
you don't know

384
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,620
the secret of my son.

385
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,620
It has nothing to do with me.

386
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,620
Thank you

387
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,620
for taking care of my son.

388
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,620
I'm grateful

389
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,620
to you.

390
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,620
It's just a training.

391
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,620
How can you

392
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,620
be so careless

393
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,620
like a young lady?

394
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,620
You're a bad boy.

395
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,620
You don't understand

396
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,620
my worries.

397
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,620
Now you're not married

398
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,620
and you're still living in the country.

399
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,620
If you keep doing this,

400
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,620
you'll be a poisonous Japanese

401
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,620
who kills and defends the emperors.

402
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,620
I'm telling you,

403
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,620
my reputation

404
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,620
will be ruined sooner or later.

405
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,620
I'm telling you,

406
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,620
I'm telling you,

407
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,620
I'm telling you,

408
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,620
I'm telling you,

409
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,620
I'm telling you,

410
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,620
I'm telling you,

411
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,620
I'm telling you,

412
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,620
I'm telling you,

413
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,620
I'm telling you,

414
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,620
I'm telling you,

415
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,620
I'm telling you,

416
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,620
I'm telling you.

417
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,620
Brother Leshun was sick yesterday.

418
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,620
It's right that he has some rest today.

419
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,620
But Brother Chong,

420
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,620
why didn't you see him?

421
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,620
Yesterday

422
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,620
he drank all the wine I've been collecting.

423
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,620
He drank ten dishes of porridge.

424
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,620
Ten?

425
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,620
He'll be a little strange when he wakes up.

426
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,620
Brother Xiang,

427
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,620
why are you looking at me this way?

428
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,620
Brother Taidian,

429
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,620
have you ever met

430
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,620
someone very important to you?

431
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,620
For example,

432
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,620
friends or relatives?

433
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,620
I've met some people.

434
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,620
I did

435
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,780
It's funny

436
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,860
My cousin and I

437
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,060
had introduced each other

438
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,060
She envied me

439
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,340
I said

440
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,740
Cousin, you're getting fat

441
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,140
She cried on the spot

442
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,740
and ignored me

443
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,620
How did you ask her to forgive you?

444
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,420
What?

445
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,460
She's fat

446
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,620
I'm not wrong

447
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,860
Anyway, a man should be

448
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,100
as high as he can be

449
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,660
You're really a man

450
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,140
I admire you

451
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,220
Brother He Shun

452
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,340
Why are you here?

453
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,780
He Shun

454
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,020
He Shun

455
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,380
How are you?

456
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,300
How's your health?

457
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,140
I'm fine

458
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,580
I can train with you

459
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,180
You're so weak

460
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,700
I'm not joking

461
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,940
Let me take you back

462
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:33,860
No need

463
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,620
I'll give you a hand

464
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,620
What's up, Si?

465
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,220
Brother Jiang

466
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,020
Si

467
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,580
What's up?

468
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,620
Si

469
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,580
Are you looking for Brother Jiang again?

470
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,340
Who's looking for him?

471
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,460
He's...

472
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,860
What are you looking for?

473
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,740
Nothing

474
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,900
Nothing?

475
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,420
You're the first daughter of Donglu

476
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,940
Why are you so ambitious

477
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,940
and peeking at me?

478
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,420
Who's peeking at you?

479
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,860
Not peeking

480
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,140
It's just that Ming is here

481
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:18,780
What?

482
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,740
What are you doing here?

483
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,380
Why do you ask?

484
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,500
I'm here to find you

485
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,060
Who said I'm here to find him?

486
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,460
I...

487
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,580
I'm here to find...

488
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,020
Find him?

489
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,660
Me?

490
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,700
Yes

491
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,060
Si

492
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,020
I've already been taken away by others

493
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:52,980
Don't worry

494
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,340
If you need anything, just tell me

495
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,220
I'll do it for you

496
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,460
But others are gone

497
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,380
Why are you still here?

498
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,220
Miss Si

499
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,700
You came to me today

500
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,860
I have something important to tell you

501
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,780
You can go ahead

502
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,820
Mr. Malicious God

503
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,500
I...

504
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:24,660
I...

505
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,100
You... What?

506
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,580
Tell me

507
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,380
Mr. Malicious God, marry me

508
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,180
Brother

509
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,140
When did you get into the Fengyou Village?

510
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,700
I didn't

511
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,620
It's not a real marriage

512
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,700
I lied to my dad

513
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,860
You mean

514
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,220
Wang Eashun disguised as your lover

515
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,580
and went back to Lin's Mansion with you

516
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,900
so that your dad can rest assured

517
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,700
and won't force you to get married again?

518
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,660
That's right

519
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,020
That's what I mean

520
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,860
Then I'll go back to Lin's Mansion

521
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,500
and ask my dad to marry me

522
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,900
I'll go back to Lin's Mansion

523
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,020
and ask my dad to marry me

524
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,300
I don't understand

525
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,420
Why did you have to marry Eashun?

526
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,660
Of course it's because

527
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,380
Mr. Malicious God is a good dancer

528
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,260
I like him

529
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,220
That's true

530
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,500
Mr. Malicious God

531
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,100
I know it's a little difficult

532
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,300
If you don't think it's convenient...

533
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,220
Convenient

534
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,260
Why not?

535
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,340
Right, Eashun?

536
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:30,740
Convenient

537
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,860
It's settled

538
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,100
When will you go back to the mansion to see your husband?

539
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,620
My husband?

540
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,340
Yes

541
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,540
Hurry up

542
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,740
Really?

543
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,780
Yes

544
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,060
Tomorrow

545
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,180
I'll arrange a proper Eashun to come

546
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,140
Eashun will repay me

547
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,660
in the future

548
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,060
I'll go now

549
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,780
Goodbye

550
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,780
Miss Eashun, actually I...

551
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,660
I'm sorry

552
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,020
Go

553
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,060
Come on

554
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,140
Bai Si

555
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,900
We're here to restore the house

556
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,220
Look

557
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,460
Why are you here?

558
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,260
What are these two birds doing?

559
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,540
What do you know?

560
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,700
The legend of the big banquet

561
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,420
is the tradition of my Eastland wedding

562
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,420
How can this kind of noise

563
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,140
be missing?

564
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,620
This is a big banquet

565
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,380
Well

566
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:23,780
Well

567
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,980
It's the same

568
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,420
The same with the big goose

569
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,500
I think you're here to make trouble

570
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,460
It's a big banquet

571
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,060
As long as we have

572
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,820
the handsome young master Eashun

573
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,100
we can make him happy

574
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,540
Ignore him

575
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,660
Today, the young master Eashun

576
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,820
just needs to help me with the fire

577
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,140
I'll take care of everything

578
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,140
Please

579
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,740
Master Li

580
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,020
Dad

581
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,460
This is my beloved one

582
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,860
Master Eashun

583
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,860
I, Eashun, greet Master Li

584
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,940
Eashun, please sit down

585
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,100
Dad

586
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,100
You've been staring at him

587
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,460
He's so shy

588
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,540
That day, I was in the Crown Prince's Camp

589
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,260
and saw Eashun

590
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,460
He was so handsome

591
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,780
But he was so shy

592
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,580
Girl

593
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,340
This time

594
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,420
you're the same as my father

595
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,540
Then it's not about him

596
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,060
In that case

597
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,500
you don't have to do this again

598
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,700
Thank you, dad

599
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,420
Since you and Sier are in love

600
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,580
please accept the marriage invitation

601
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,260
Today, we'll also

602
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,420
Marry

603
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,580
What's the matter with you?

604
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,780
No, dad

605
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,060
It's his first time here

606
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,620
How can he set a date?

607
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,220
It's not even the eighth time

608
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,420
Please accept the invitation

609
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,260
Find a way

610
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,220
What can I do?

611
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,540
Please, Eashun

612
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,860
Dad

613
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,020
You're so anxious

614
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,020
How can I not be anxious about your marriage?

615
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,980
We just met

616
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,380
It's too urgent

617
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,500
We don't know each other yet

618
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,700
You forced me

619
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,420
Dad

620
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,260
You're so embarrassing

621
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,620
You can't do this

622
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,340
What are you doing?

623
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:10,980
Dad

624
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,700
What are you doing?

625
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,140
Actually

626
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,140
Actually

627
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,780
I fell in love with Miss Sier

628
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,620
If I can't marry Miss Sier

629
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,300
in this life

630
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,580
I'll never be able to

631
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,100
die in this life

632
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:27,980
You bastard

633
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,140
Take him out

634
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:29,940
This marriage

635
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:30,580
I, Mr. Li

636
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:30,980
Mr. Li

637
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:31,380
Take him out

638
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,100
Mr. Li

639
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,420
Get out

640
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:34,780
Mr. Li

641
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,740
Get out

642
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,380
We're at the gate

643
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,220
OK

644
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,660
It's so urgent

645
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:48,780
Miss Sier

646
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,580
Mr. Li must have found out our trick

647
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,980
I'm afraid he'll make it hard for you in the future

648
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,780
After all this

649
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,540
I'm afraid my dad will ignore me for a while

650
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,260
It's OK

651
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,340
How about it?

652
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,540
If it weren't for me

653
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,700
You two

654
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,220
would have been sent to the bridal chamber

655
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,860
You can't joke like this

656
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,060
In this case

657
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,180
I was scolded by the police

658
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,220
and I acted in the play

659
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,020
I should express my gratitude

660
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:15,900
OK

661
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,860
I also thank Mr. Eishun for helping me

662
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,900
I'll treat you to the wine at the Chansi Restaurant tonight

663
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,260
Great

664
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,540
Let's go to have a drink

665
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,100
Go

666
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:24,900
Go

667
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,580
Miss Asu

668
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,100
It's closed today

669
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,380
I should go back to the camp

670
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,780
How can that be?

671
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,020
I haven't thanked you yet

672
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,020
I didn't want to come today

673
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,860
It's Mr. Jiang who asked me to help

674
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,180
You can thank him if you want

675
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,620
What?

676
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,020
You don't even want to drink with me now?

677
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,540
You're so talkative

678
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,740
It's just a drink

679
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,020
I'm just a drinker

680
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,980
I'll see who dares not drink my wine

681
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,660
Let's go to have a drink

682
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,220
Do you know

683
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,740
why my dad forced me to get married?

684
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,980
Why?

685
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,100
He was afraid that one day he would let go of the man

686
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,660
The evil spirits in the

687
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,900
house of money will bully me

688
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,220
So he wanted to entrust me to someone as soon as possible

689
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,460
So he can rest in peace

690
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,180
He was so rude to me today

691
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,060
He even helped me for Asu

692
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,980
You're so mean

693
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,940
I think Mr. Li is right

694
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,220
It's said that the melon is not sweet

695
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,740
You pick it yourself

696
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,140
Do you think it's delicious?

697
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,780
What do you mean?

698
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,940
You're not going to marry anyone in your life?

699
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,740
You don't marry anyone who is kind-hearted?

700
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,860
Kind-hearted?

701
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,700
What a joke

702
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,300
What a joke?

703
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,340
If you don't have anyone

704
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,500
why do you come to Shizi Hill three times?

705
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,020
If you don't have anyone

706
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,300
why do you meet

707
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,580
someone who is kind-hearted?

708
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,780
Who comes to Shizi Hill three times?

709
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,700
You're so beautiful

710
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,900
What beautiful?

711
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,580
It's the fact

712
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,020
Girl

713
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,980
Look at our great champion

714
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,700
He is so beautiful

715
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,300
I'm so satisfied

716
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,540
Great

717
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,900
Are you talking about He Shun?

718
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:49,980
Yes

719
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,020
Don't you think you two are a good match?

720
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,660
I'm a good match for you

721
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,740
You

722
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,380
Drink, drink

723
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,580
I didn't say anything

724
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,860
You didn't hear anything

725
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,820
Drink

726
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,620
Miss Asu is drunk

727
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,180
We should send her back

728
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,220
I haven't finished drinking

729
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,580
If you have an appetite, you can continue

730
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,700
I'll send her back

731
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,220
They all left

732
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:50,980
I'm so happy

733
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,380
I'm so happy

734
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,700
I'm so happy

735
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,980
I'm so happy

736
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,420
I'm so happy

737
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,900
I'm so happy

738
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,380
I'm so happy

739
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,820
I'm so happy

740
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,300
I'm so happy

741
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,820
I'm so happy

742
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,420
I'm so happy

743
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,980
I'm so happy

744
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,380
I'm so happy

745
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,900
I'm so happy

746
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,420
I'm so happy

747
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,980
I'm so happy

748
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,620
I'm so happy

749
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,060
I'm so happy

750
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,540
I'm so happy

751
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,060
I'm so happy

752
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,460
I'm so happy

753
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,060
I'm so happy

754
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,740
I'm so happy

755
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,260
I'm so happy

756
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,860
I'm so happy

757
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,460
I'm so happy

758
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,980
I'm so happy

759
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,660
I'm so happy

760
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,260
I'm so happy

761
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,860
I'm so happy

762
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,460
I'm so happy

763
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,060
I'm so happy

764
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,660
I'm so happy

765
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,260
I'm so happy

766
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,860
I'm so happy

767
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,460
I'm so happy

768
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,060
I'm so happy

769
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,660
I'm so happy

770
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,380
So happy

771
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,620
I'm so happy

772
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,340
I'm so happy

773
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,260
I'm so happy

774
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,860
I'm so happy

775
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,780
