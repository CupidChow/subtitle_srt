1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We'll just do what we need to do.

2
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,960
So whether you'll believe us or not,

3
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,160
the scenery Hospital,

4
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:48,300
and even how weday ageing ageing ageed ageing

5
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,940
Will always have faith.

6
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,780
And to be honest,

7
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,460
our hearts are Sheikh-like.

8
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,740
Can't explain it any further.

9
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,640
Ha혁nn went back rookPA.

10
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,580
Yan Yu was the

11
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,760
The

12
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,060
Kunwu Gongzi

13
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,220
will definitely remember his identity

14
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,940
after entering the city.

15
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,580
From now on,

16
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,980
you are the heir to Duke Nan Bo's house,

17
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,540
Ershun.

18
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,660
I want to make a deal with you.

19
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,060
What deal?

20
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,180
In ten days,

21
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,620
I want you to go to the Eastern Dragon City

22
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,780
for me

23
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,780
I'll kill you.

24
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,540
Are you sick?

25
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,660
I once rode a horse to the palace to get my hair done.

26
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,020
But now, I'm as old as the autumn.

27
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,500
I'm useless.

28
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,580
It's hard to be a rich man.

29
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,340
I'm poor and poor.

30
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,020
If I don't have a son,

31
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,300
I'll be a poor man in Nanjing.

32
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,460
So I'm looking for you.

33
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,780
It's a time for chaos.

34
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,060
Why should I help you?

35
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,100
I'll pay you back for your life.

36
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,220
Do you know that Lin Mei is still alive?

37
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,220
What did you say?

38
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,220
Lin Mei,

39
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,460
I'm afraid you're the only family in this world.

40
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,300
You've lived for many years

41
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,780
just to return to your homeland

42
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,780
and see your old friends.

43
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,780
What do you know?

44
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,900
I know something

45
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,860
that you must know.

46
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,700
I know it clearly.

47
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,060
So in this world,

48
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,460
only I can help you.

49
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,740
And you can only trust me.

50
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,900
You beat Li Xiaomu and Yu слไมe.

51
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,980
Canуетou,

52
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,780
you're the chief of our mansion.

53
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,220
Tell your father

54
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,140
to come and save me.

55
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,780
Give me this also.

56
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,940
Prince.

57
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,100
The poor man is dead.

58
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,980
I came here with some money.

59
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,380
If you want to see him

60
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,380
Please accept it

61
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,380
Who is this person?

62
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,380
Chong Yibiao

63
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,380
He is the first warrior of my northern grassland

64
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,380
The second son of Lord Bei Bo

65
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,380
Lord Chong

66
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,380
It's my fault

67
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,380
Please accept it

68
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,380
Lord Nian

69
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,380
You are really a gold

70
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,380
I see you have been apologizing for a long time

71
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,380
But the one inside

72
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,380
made a net

73
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,380
You never thought that

74
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,380
What if he is a dragon?

75
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,380
Who is this?

76
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,380
Don't talk, you are not afraid of death?

77
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,380
Even if he is not a dragon

78
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,380
He is just a second son

79
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,380
who is just a second son

80
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,380
What?

81
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,380
What?

82
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,380
Want to fight?

83
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,380
What did you say?

84
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,380
I

85
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,380
I

86
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,380
I want you to say it again

87
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,380
I am wrong

88
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,380
You don't know what is beautiful

89
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,380
I am wrong

90
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,380
You are so shameless

91
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,380
You think I am afraid of you?

92
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,380
Young master

93
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,380
Thank you for your help

94
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,380
I am Ning Zhou, Ning Ziyu

95
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,380
I want to ask you a favor

96
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,380
You are welcome, I am Xinjia

97
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,380
I am from Xichuan

98
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,380
I am sorry

99
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,380
I am not used to the kind of people I am

100
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,380
I am not good at it

101
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,380
I am just angry

102
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,380
Master Xinjia, it is a good chance to meet you

103
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,380
You helped me today

104
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,380
I am a young master, I want to have a good meal

105
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,380
Keep it, I have it

106
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,380
Go

107
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,380
Are you going to play with me?

108
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,380
I am a new employee, I don't know what to say

109
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,380
What? Sit here

110
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,380
I tell you

111
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,380
Today's meal must be

112
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,380
No, forget it, I will pay

113
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,380
Give him

114
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,380
Take it

115
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,380
That is my wallet, stop him

116
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,380
Still want to run?

117
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,380
The bride doesn't marry a man to be a thief

118
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,380
I don't know why

119
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,380
Brother Jiang, let me see

120
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,380
Which one?

121
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,380
It is a young lady

122
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,380
A bride

123
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,380
Does it hurt?

124
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,380
Brother Jiang

125
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,380
You want to get along with the Western Regions

126
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,380
Which one are you?

127
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,380
Don't run

128
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,380
How much?

129
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,380
How much?

130
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,380
Is it enough?

131
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,380
Where is he?

132
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,380
A carriage

133
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,380
Go

134
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,380
Don't make any noise

135
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,380
Or I will cut you

136
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,380
Where is he?

137
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,380
He runs fast

138
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,380
Miss, this

139
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,380
I can't kill you, give it back to me

140
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,380
You want this?

141
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,380
I want

142
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,380
The one who is so cruel

143
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,380
I will give it back to you

144
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,380
Why is it her?

145
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,380
Is there anyone in the carriage?

146
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,380
Have you ever seen a thief

147
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,380
who disguised as a bride?

148
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,380
But I have one more thing

149
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,380
What?

150
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,380
Is it the crown prince of Eastland

151
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,380
Jiang Wenhuan?

152
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,380
But I want to remind you

153
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,380
The crown prince of Eastland

154
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,380
is smart

155
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,380
Don't reveal your identity

156
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,380
Otherwise

157
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,380
we will be in trouble

158
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,380
I am

159
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,380
the son of Duke Nanbo

160
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,380
Eishun

161
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,380
Well

162
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,380
Have you seen

163
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,380
Mr. Jiang, please

164
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,380
I am sorry

165
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,380
I am sorry

166
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,380
I am sorry

167
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,380
I am sorry

168
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,380
I am sorry

169
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,380
I am sorry

170
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,380
I am sorry

171
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,380
I am sorry

172
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,380
You

173
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,380
You know me?

174
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,380
Mr. Jiang

175
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,380
You are so handsome

176
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,380
You must be

177
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,380
the son of Duke Nanbo

178
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,380
Jiang Wenhuan

179
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,380
You are so

180
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,380
observant

181
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,380
Well, I am following the girl who disguised as a bride

182
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,380
Do you see anyone suspicious?

183
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,380
Yes

184
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,380
Where?

185
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,380
Over there

186
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,380
Thank you

187
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,380
In fact

188
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,380
It's not a short time

189
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,380
to chase after the boy

190
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,380
Eishun comes from a long way

191
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,380
I am the owner of the place

192
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,380
Why not

193
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,380
send him to the post station

194
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,380
But in the carriage

195
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,380
someone is walking with Eishun

196
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,380
I don't know

197
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,380
who is the man

198
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,380
who is the man

199
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,380
I don't know

200
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,380
if I have a seat

201
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,380
in the carriage

202
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,380
Mr. Jiang

203
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,380
I am going to the East Road alone

204
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,380
In the carriage

205
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,380
there is only

206
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,380
a wild cat that I saved

207
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,380
Eishun

208
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,380
is kind

209
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,380
But this beast is wild

210
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,380
Be careful to save it

211
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,380
or you will be hurt by it

212
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,380
I am going to save it

213
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,380
I will be responsible

214
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,380
for it

215
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,380
Besides

216
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,380
wild cat is kind

217
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,380
I will repay you

218
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,380
Ok

219
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,380
Please

220
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,380
Eishun

221
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,380
do it well

222
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,380
Ok

223
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,380
Mr. Eishun

224
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,380
Why are you so persistent

225
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,380
You should do your best

226
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,380
to do what you can

227
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,380
Ok

228
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,380
Don't bother

229
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,380
I just stole your wallet

230
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,380
Here

231
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,380
I will return it to you

232
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,380
You want to leave after stealing

233
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,380
I returned it to you

234
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,380
Why do you arrest me

235
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,380
I think you are wearing gold

236
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,380
and you stole it

237
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,380
You stole the bride's stuff

238
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,380
You

239
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,380
Go to hell

240
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,380
Don't run

241
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,380
Give me my wallet

242
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,380
Give me my wallet

243
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,380
Sorry

244
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,380
You are the son of the Crown Prince of Dongwu Palace

245
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,380
Ok, wait

246
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,380
Let me help you

247
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,380
No need

248
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,380
Let's go

249
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,380
Go

250
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,380
Go

251
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,380
Go

252
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,380
Go

253
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,380
Go

254
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,380
Go

255
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,380
Mr. Eishun

256
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,380
I am sorry for your absence

257
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,380
Mr. Jiang is just

258
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,380
I am sorry

259
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,380
Hero saves beauty

260
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,380
I understand

261
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,380
I will leave now

262
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,380
I have one more thing

263
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,380
What is it

264
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,380
Have you seen each other

265
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,380
I have been ill for a long time

266
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,380
I haven't been out for a long time

267
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,380
I remember it wrong

268
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,380
I will leave now

269
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,380
Childe

270
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,380
It's settled

271
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,380
Go back to the station

272
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,380
and prepare for tonight's banquet

273
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,380
Wait

274
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,380
I am sorry

275
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,380
Mr. Jiang

276
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,380
This little thief

277
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,380
He is wearing gold and silver

278
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,380
and he stole it

279
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,380
It's really strange

280
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,380
Forget it

281
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,380
Let's get to the point

282
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,380
Where is my stuff

283
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,380
Where is the half-candle

284
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,380
Dongwu Palace

285
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,380
Where is the half-candle

286
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,380
Dongwu Palace's heir Jiang Enhuan

287
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,380
Let me help you

288
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,380
No need

289
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,380
Did the princess

290
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,380
take it away

291
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,380
How much is this

292
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,380
How much is this

293
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,380
I am paying

294
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,380
A broken copper bar

295
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,380
You can take it

296
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,380
I will give you a chance

297
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,380
Think about it

298
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,380
Which way to get it

299
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,380
Miss

300
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,380
What is the most important thing in business

301
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,380
It's honesty

302
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,380
What is the most important thing in money and money

303
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,380
It's fairness

304
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,380
Don't be so arrogant

305
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,380
when my father is not here

306
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,380
You are being so arrogant

307
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,380
You are insulting my reputation

308
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,380
and my colleagues

309
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,380
Miss

310
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,380
We are in the dark

311
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,380
What's wrong with the dark

312
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,380
There is justice

313
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,380
Do you understand

314
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,380
Since the day you ran away from the wedding

315
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,380
you have been missing for many days

316
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,380
Now you are here

317
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,380
Don't tell my father I was here

318
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,380
Yes, Miss

319
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,380
You can leave

320
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,380
Yes

321
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,380
Help me check this

322
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,380
This is

323
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,380
Dongwu Palace's heir Jiang Enhuan's

324
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,380
I am afraid

325
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,380
Don't be afraid

326
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,380
He is just a heir

327
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,380
His father is here

328
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,380
He should show us some affection

329
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,380
Look

330
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,380
What makes Jiang Enhuan so precious

331
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,380
There is only half of the black thing

332
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,380
I have seen the pattern on it

333
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,380
recently

334
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,380
Where did you see it

335
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,380
You don't know

336
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,380
Recently, someone has been stealing goods from Guifang

337
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,380
There is a black box

338
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,380
with a similar pattern on it

339
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,380
I heard they moved into the city

340
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,380
when they arrived at the night market

341
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,380
The box has the same pattern

342
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,380
as the one on the black box

343
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,380
Jiang Enhuan

344
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,380
I told you

345
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,380
You are just a man

346
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,380
You should do something good

347
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,380
Where is it now

348
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,380
Inside the box

349
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,380
It's a heavenly book

350
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,380
Go and check it

351
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,380
What's in the box

352
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,380
What's inside the box

353
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,380
What

354
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,380
And don't tell my father

355
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,380
Otherwise I will

356
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,380
I understand

357
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,380
I will do it

358
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,380
I am a thief

359
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,380
I want to see

360
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,380
how your Dongwu Duke

361
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,380
is related to the four-way

362
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,380
journey of Guifang

363
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,380
Is it

364
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,380
like this

365
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,380
It's all your fault

366
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,380
Master

367
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,380
The night party for the princes

368
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,380
is about to start

369
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,380
The young master asked you to wear the court dress

370
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,380
to host the banquet tonight

371
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,380
I won't go

372
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,380
Let my brother go

373
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,380
You should put it on

374
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,380
Your highness

375
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,380
Ding

376
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,380
Look at you

377
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,380
It's not my fault

378
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,380
It seems that

379
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,380
you can only reply to my brother

380
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,380
You can't wear it

381
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,380
It's not right to wear dirty clothes

382
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,380
So

383
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,380
You have a reason

384
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,380
Master

385
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,380
But there is another one

386
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,380
in the court dress

387
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,380
There is

388
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,380
No, no, no

389
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,380
Tonight

390
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,380
I will host the banquet

391
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,380
to express my gratitude

392
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,380
I am glad to welcome you

393
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,380
to come here

394
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,380
I hope you all

395
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,380
will fight hard

396
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,380
on the battlefield of tomorrow's battle

397
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,380
and win the battle

398
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,380
Thank you

399
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,380
General

400
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,380
We will not give up

401
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,380
and have a good battle

402
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,380
Tonight's banquet

403
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,380
You can choose your opponent

404
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,380
to warm up for tomorrow's battle

405
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,380
and help the banquet tonight

406
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,380
Let's start

407
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,380
In the fighting game

408
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,380
The difficult one, Mr. E-Shun

409
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,380
is the number one and the number two

410
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,380
Really?

411
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,380
You mean the only son of Nanpo, E-Shun

412
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,380
I also have a son

413
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,380
Why hasn't the son of Nanpo come yet?

414
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,380
Such an important occasion

415
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,380
It's inappropriate for him to come alone

416
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,380
Now Nanpo is in the capital

417
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,380
He has a strong side

418
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,380
The son of Nanpo is also a proud man

419
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,380
Good

420
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,380
He is coming

421
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,380
The battle is about to begin

422
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,380
The battle is about to begin

423
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,380
The battle is about to begin

424
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,380
The battle is about to begin

425
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,380
The battle is about to begin

426
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,380
The battle is about to begin

427
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,380
The battle is about to begin

428
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,380
The battle is about to begin

429
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,380
The battle is about to begin

430
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,380
The battle is about to begin

431
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,380
The battle is about to begin

432
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,380
The battle is about to begin

433
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,380
The battle is about to begin

434
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,380
The battle is about to begin

435
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,000
No

436
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,040
I expected it

437
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,800
Unexpectedly, a good war African

438
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:45,880
Take a sense of good

439
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,880
I have waited for you for a long time

440
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,680
Tonight's competition, I choose him.

441
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,680
He Shun.

442
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,280
This Lv Lie is really good at picking people.

443
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,080
I think tonight, this South Marquis, the Crown Prince,

444
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,080
will be...

445
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,280
Little shoulder, you really dare to come up.

446
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,080
When you first come to the Eastern Tower,

447
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,480
there will be someone who will make things difficult for you.

448
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,680
I have some grudges with this person when I was young.

449
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,480
You be careful of avoiding him.

450
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,480
If it's him, then it's him.

451
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,280
If...

452
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,880
I can't avoid him.

453
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,880
My first love...

454
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,480
She isn't from my heart!

455
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,200
You two look quite alike.

456
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,340
He looks like black....

457
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,340
What kind of match is this?

458
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,420
It has to beBrave SP yet.

459
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
Make a move.

460
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,400
This...

461
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,280
Isn't this...

462
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:24,960
from theirê old times?

463
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,240
Yeah. It shouldn't be like this.

464
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,240
Why don't you fight back?

465
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,680
You look down on me.

466
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,040
If I can't fight back,

467
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,080
what's the point?

468
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,640
Fine.

469
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,600
You're too strong.

470
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,000
You'll kill me if you fight back.

471
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I'm not afraid of you.

472
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I'm not afraid of you.

473
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I'm not afraid of you.

474
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I'm not afraid of you.

475
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I'm not afraid of you.

476
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I'm not afraid of you.

477
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I'm not afraid of you.

478
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I'm afraid of you.

479
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Mr. Cheng.

480
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Why are you so serious?

481
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Let go of me.

482
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Stop it.

483
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
This competition is just for luck.

484
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Jiang Wenhuan, don't be so rude.

485
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Get up.

486
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Useless.

487
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Are you okay?

488
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I'm fine.

489
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Thank you.

490
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Huan.

491
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Take Mr. Sheng to the mansion to apply the medicine.

492
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Go.

493
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
In tonight's fight,

494
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
thanks to Mr. Jiang's help,

495
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I'm not very grateful.

496
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I finally know

497
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
why you look familiar.

498
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
You look like a friend of my son.

499
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Da Huang.

500
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Da Huang?

501
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Do you want to see?

502
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Look.

503
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Dog?

504
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm not talking about you.

505
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Don't be so rude.

506
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm not talking about you.

507
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I'm talking about you.

508
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Don't get me wrong.

509
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I just think

510
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
your eyes

511
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
are similar to his.

512
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
No wonder I feel familiar

513
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
when I see you.

514
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Does it

515
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
smell good?

516
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Actually, Da Huang

517
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
is my only childhood friend.

518
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
When I was a kid,

519
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
my parents fought outside all the time.

520
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
My brother was busy with the Eastland business.

521
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
So in the mansion,

522
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I was alone.

523
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
But fortunately,

524
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I have Da Huang.

525
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
So Da Huang is now...

526
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Dead.

527
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Sorry.

528
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
It's okay.

529
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Da Huang

530
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
died to save my son.

531
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Once,

532
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I went out with him to play in the river.

533
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
But that day,

534
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
the river was too steep.

535
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I accidentally didn't stand still

536
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
and fell into the river.

537
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
He tried his best to bite my foot

538
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
and tried to pull me back.

539
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
In the end,

540
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I was pulled to the shore.

541
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
But he

542
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
was washed away by the river.

543
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
When Da Huang was leaving,

544
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
he struggled with his life.

545
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I know

546
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
he wanted to survive.

547
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I can't forget

548
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
his stubborn

549
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
and persistent eyes

550
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
for the rest of my life.

551
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And I've seen

552
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
this kind of eyes three times.

553
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
The first time was Da Huang.

554
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
The second time was a slave.

555
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
The third time was you.

556
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
So when I saw you,

557
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
it was like seeing Da Huang.

558
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I helped him.

559
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
It's okay.

560
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's not a serious injury.

561
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It shouldn't be a big deal.

562
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
But tomorrow,

563
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
don't try so hard.

564
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Thank you.

565
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Mr. Jiang,

566
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
what are you drawing?

567
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
This?

568
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
A strange thing.

569
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I was thinking about what to use it for.

570
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I didn't expect

571
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
that the lady was stolen.

572
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
So I drew it

573
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
according to my memory.

574
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
But I think

575
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
something is wrong with the painting.

576
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
It's this.

577
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Mr. Jiang, look.

578
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
This thing is shaped and adjusted.

579
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It has a pointy tail.

580
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
It's like

581
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
a key.

582
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
A key?

583
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Yes.

584
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Be careful.

585
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Don't be found.

586
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Mr. Jiang,

587
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
what are we looking for?

588
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Didn't the lady say

589
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
that the thing she found

590
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
was a silk thing

591
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
from Guifang State.

592
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Look carefully.

593
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Mr. Jiang, I found it.

594
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Look.

595
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
What's inside?

596
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
This...

597
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
What's inside?

598
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
What's inside?

599
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
It's a person.

600
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
A person?

601
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Not a person.

602
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Tell me clearly.

603
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
What's inside?

604
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
It's a person.

605
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Not a person.

606
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
In our Nandu,

607
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
there's a common thing

608
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
that beasts fight each other.

609
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
People often

610
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
participate in the fight

611
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
to win the competition.

612
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
They will search for the most fierce beasts

613
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
from all over the place

614
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
to participate in the fight.

615
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
And those who sell them

616
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
will use this kind of

617
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
special lock

618
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
to lock the beasts

619
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
to prevent them from hurting people.

620
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Master,

621
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
a fellow from Nulishen

622
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
sent a message.

623
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Which country is the pattern

624
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
on the bronze bar

625
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
belongs to?

626
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It's said that it's Guifang State

627
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
that has been fighting with me

628
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
for many years.

629
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Guifang State?

630
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Since the lock of this key

631
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
is made for beasts,

632
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
it must be a combination

633
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
of the beasts

634
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
and the competition

635
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
tomorrow.

636
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
If the master is connected

637
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
with Guifang State,

638
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I have to prepare early

639
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
to prevent any trouble.

640
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I'd like to see

641
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
what tricks you can play.

642
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I heard that the new year's report

643
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
has been sent to all the places.

644
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Yes.

645
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It seems that many

646
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Western-Chuan

647
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
boba masters are coming.

648
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Yes.

649
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
It's true.

650
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Yes.

651
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
It's true.

652
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
There are many people

653
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
who are coming.

654
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
The Western-Chuan masters

655
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
are so brave.

656
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Our Donglu's

657
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Jiang's master is not bad.

658
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Yes.

659
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I don't know which country's

660
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
crown prince

661
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
can control the last iron-cut god of war.

662
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Which country's crown prince is he?

663
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
He looks so arrogant.

664
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
God of War and father and son,

665
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
the people think that

666
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
we are the ones who are in trouble.

667
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
We are brave.

668
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Courageous move is to follow the way that God of War

669
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Because this is a subject of custom.

670
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Because this is a subject of custom.

671
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
moyens are experienced

672
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
어서

673
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
According to thefflen Moab awhile

674
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
we should be brave duo,

675
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Therefore,

676
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,000
God of War Qu Antrag

677
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And it starts

678
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,760
Go!

679
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,480
Yi'er.

680
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,560
Miss.

681
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,960
I should send the herbs.

682
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:57,960
If something happens to you,

683
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,920
I will...

684
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,720
Alright.

685
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,480
Don't make a scene with my dad.

686
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,560
Are you sure

687
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,920
the black box with blood

688
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,280
was sent to this stable?

689
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,120
I sent people to watch it last night.

690
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,040
It's not wrong.

691
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,720
Alright.

692
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:14,960
Later,

693
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,200
help me distract the steward.

694
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,280
I will see

695
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,480
what's wrong

696
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,080
with the House of Marquis.

697
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,080
Where are the people who sent the herbs?

698
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,000
Where are they?

699
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,320
They sent the herbs, right?

700
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,280
Yes.

701
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,160
This way.

702
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,360
My lord.

703
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,280
My lord.

704
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,320
Let me help you up.

705
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,920
Why are you so careless?

706
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,800
My bad.

707
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,640
My bad.

708
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:43,920
Be careful.

709
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,640
Be careful.

710
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,440
It's okay. Don't turn around.

711
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,800
I deserve to die.

712
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,440
So many herbs.

713
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,240
They are all inferior.

714
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:54,960
They are for the horse.

715
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,880
I'm not afraid of

716
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,760
eating the horse's stomach.

717
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,720
They are so mean.

718
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,000
Alright?

719
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,640
Thank you.

720
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,360
Nice to meet you my lord!

721
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,080
Nice to meet you my lord!

722
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,720
Nice to meet you my lord!

723
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,800
Nice to meet you my lord!

724
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,160
Long live the Emperor!

725
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,120
Really?

726
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,880
Brother Feng is the best warrior in the grassland.

727
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,280
He's just a wolf.

728
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,720
He's not a good fighter.

729
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,200
Long live the Emperor!

730
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,600
Someone must be talking about this black box.

731
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,240
It was indeed sent to this stable.

732
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,920
Throw it away!

733
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,960
Long live the Emperor!

734
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,480
What's going on?

735
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,320
What's going on?

736
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,840
Such a big box.

737
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,320
But where are the evil things inside?

738
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,760
Where did they go?

739
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,240
What's going on?

740
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,040
What's going on?

741
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,080
Isn't it over?

742
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,040
Why is it here again?

743
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,000
What's this?

744
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,960
It's so scary.

745
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,840
Why is it so big?

746
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,040
What kind of monster is this?

747
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,920
Where did they come from?

748
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,080
General, I don't know either.

749
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,080
Be careful!

750
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,360
Run!

751
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,360
Run!

752
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,080
Hurry up!

753
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,120
Get out!

754
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,680
Get out!

755
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,720
General,

756
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,080
the gate is blocked by the guard.

757
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,360
It's hard to open it.

758
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:35,880
Let's go.

759
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,320
Let's go and get the people.

760
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,560
No.

761
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,160
These monsters are leaving.

762
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,360
I'll go and get the monsters.

763
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,560
Let's go and get the people.

764
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,320
Come on, you monster!

765
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,080
I'll get the people.

766
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,720
We have to hurry up and send the troops to get the people out.

767
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,080
Otherwise, if something happens to the monsters,

768
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,280
we will definitely be in trouble.

769
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,320
We will definitely be in trouble.

770
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,920
But can you hold on?

771
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,920
I can't help you.

772
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,880
I'll go too.

773
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,080
Here we are.

774
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:34,920
It's here.

775
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,120
Come on.

776
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,800
Take charge of this!

777
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,200
So that she won't lie to me,

778
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,160
without seeing me after her death.

779
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,600
It is the story of a high mate

780
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:02,960
and a woman who only talked about keeping in touch.

781
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,360
Tomorrow morning,

782
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,200
can you tell me

783
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,200
The End
