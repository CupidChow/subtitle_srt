1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The love and dreams of love are endless

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,600
Never give up on the world

3
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,400
Only for the destination in our hearts

4
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,000
Until the dawn breaks

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Never stop

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The love and dreams of love are endless

7
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Never give up on the world

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Only for the destination in our hearts

9
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Until the dawn breaks

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Never stop

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The love and dreams of love are endless

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Never stop

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
A Flowing River

14
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,500
This is wrong. I kept searching.

15
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,400
What are you doing?

16
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,400
See.

17
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,000
If you have evidence,

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
it shows that you saved Brother Chong.

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Can you tell me

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,800
that he would be thankful to his lifesaver?

21
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,800
The mother of all things

22
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,000
and like-minded until death with one's thoughts?

23
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,000
Let me tell you,

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,100
for Brother Chong who had a experience of being surgery

25
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,700
our little brothers

26
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,100
I'll leave it to you

27
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,780
So funny

28
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,380
Why are you so late?

29
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,300
How much did you drink?

30
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,780
Enough, enough, enough

31
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,180
Go back and have a rest

32
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,380
No need

33
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,220
I can drink that much

34
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,780
We found it

35
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,820
What did you find, melodramatic demon?

36
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,660
Brother, look

37
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,020
This is aずあず

38
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,700
Well done, Brother

39
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,740
It's good

40
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,820
I must ask the Golden Th已 Nim Tabii

41
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,340
to buy me some drinks for me

42
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,860
Let him tell me brother

43
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,300
for the sake of all the beauties

44
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,460
Wait

45
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,020
Look

46
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,700
What's this?

47
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,420
Money

48
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,540
The seal of Qian Kun Lane?

49
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,140
The footprints in the backyard

50
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,020
are clearly left-footed.

51
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,900
Why is the right foot

52
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,940
on the rock?

53
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,260
What's wrong with Adi?

54
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:14,900
Master,

55
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,020
the account book of this music book

56
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:16,860
is ready.

57
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,500
Wait for me here.

58
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,340
Brother itself

59
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,020
was here too?

60
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,300
So...

61
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,300
So,

62
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:01,900
when do you

63
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,140
make the Presidential Test result?

64
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:09,980
I mean,

65
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,060
when is it going to be done?

66
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,460
Anyway,

67
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,180
since it's already official,

68
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,940
I'll wait and see.

69
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:17,900
My brother

70
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,220
has been here

71
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,860
before me,

72
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,780
he wasn't here the whole time.

73
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,220
Tell me why?

74
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,020
I never knew it.

75
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,020
What is my father hiding here?

76
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,020
Is it really about that murder?

77
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,020
I don't know.

78
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,020
This is...

79
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,020
You got the item?

80
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:30,020
This is the contract that I signed with the old marquis.

81
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:37,020
As you wish, I've already taken Chong Yiwu's life for you.

82
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,020
What else do you want?

83
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:54,020
You believe that I will help you?

84
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,020
It's just a contract.

85
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,020
If I burn it, it will be my sincerity to you.

86
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,020
But even if this contract is gone,

87
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:10,020
you will still remember what happened 16 years ago.

88
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,020
If this doesn't work,

89
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:21,020
I can guarantee that you and your daughter will not be able to leave this world.

90
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,020
What do you want?

91
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,020
Chong Yiwu's death is just a shadow.

92
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:37,020
The real good show will be waiting for you to help me again.

93
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,020
You...

94
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,020
So Father has done a lot for me.

95
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,020
Father, I believe that you are not the murderer.

96
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,020
This time, I will definitely protect you.

97
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,020
Father,

98
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:32,020
the beads I gave you a few days ago, do you still have them?

99
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,020
What's wrong?

100
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,020
I asked Yi'er to make some new jewelry for me.

101
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,020
I think if you like the beads,

102
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,020
I will let someone buy you another pair.

103
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,020
Look.

104
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,020
The gift that I gave you,

105
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,020
I will naturally wear it with me.

106
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,020
But one pair is enough.

107
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,020
You should choose the one you like.

108
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,020
You should choose more jewelry.

109
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,020
You should dress up yourself.

110
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,020
Only then can you find a good husband.

111
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:15,020
Father, I have said it many times. I don't want to get married.

112
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,020
You don't want to marry anyone.

113
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:22,020
You don't want to marry anyone other than Jiang Wenhuan, right?

114
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,020
Father, why are you talking about him again?

115
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:31,020
Girl, can you hide it from me with your little mind?

116
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,020
I have told you many times.

117
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,020
Don't get involved with the Jiang family.

118
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,020
You just don't listen.

119
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,020
Why?

120
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:49,020
Why is it that you have always been afraid that I would get in touch with Jiang Wenhuan?

121
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,020
Afraid that I would have a connection with the Dongwu family?

122
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,020
Could it be that our Qian Kun Lane

123
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,020
has something that is against the Dongwu family?

124
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,020
Nonsense.

125
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,020
Or what?

126
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,020
I really don't understand why father hates Jiang Wenhuan so much.

127
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,020
Also, I have always wanted to inherit the Qian Kun Lane that father personally built

128
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,020
to share my worries.

129
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,020
But you never let me touch the things in Qian Kun Lane.

130
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:19,020
Could it be that Qian Kun Lane has done something that is not seen by anyone behind it?

131
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,020
Lei A-Si, are you a winged man now?

132
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,020
How dare you question your father?

133
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,020
I am not a winged man.

134
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,020
I just want father to give me a reasonable explanation.

135
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,020
There is nothing to explain.

136
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,020
Anyway, from now on, you are not allowed to see Jiang Wenhuan again.

137
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,020
You are not allowed to interfere in Qian Kun Lane's affairs.

138
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,020
Father,

139
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,020
although I am really worried about you,

140
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,020
General, the North Marquis has sent a letter.

141
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,020
How is it? The North Marquis didn't make things difficult for us, right?

142
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,020
The North Marquis is willing to let things go

143
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,020
and let us find out the truth.

144
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,020
If Chong Yibiao did it,

145
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,020
then send it back to the guards.

146
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,020
General,

147
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,020
there is still something wrong.

148
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,020
Forget it.

149
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,020
Since the person died in our Eastland,

150
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,020
we should be careful.

151
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,020
We must find out the truth as soon as possible.

152
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,020
We must return the justice to the North Marquis.

153
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,020
Then, do we need to postpone the meeting tonight?

154
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,020
No.

155
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,020
We need to investigate the case.

156
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,020
We need to handle the matter.

157
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,020
I will go back to the North Marquis.

158
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,020
I will go back to the North Marquis.

159
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,020
We need to investigate the case.

160
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,020
We need to handle the matter.

161
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,020
Yes, Your Majesty.

162
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,020
What is the matter that makes you so anxious?

163
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,020
After Qian Kun Lane left,

164
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,020
I was in a bad mood.

165
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,020
I looked for people who were suspicious.

166
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,020
But I didn't find any.

167
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,020
It was like someone was hiding something.

168
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,020
I wonder if you have any news.

169
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,020
I told you.

170
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,020
I checked all the shoes of Qian Kun Lane.

171
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,020
I didn't find anything.

172
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,020
What?

173
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,020
You don't believe me?

174
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,020
Of course not.

175
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,020
We believe Miss A-Si.

176
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,020
Have you seen this?

177
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,020
Where did you get it?

178
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,020
Chongyiwu's bedroom.

179
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,020
This is the beads from our Li's Mansion.

180
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,020
Really?

181
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,020
Really?

182
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,020
Miss A-Si, why do you say that?

183
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,020
Look at the beads.

184
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,020
Although there is my seal on it,

185
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,020
Yingke's work is too rough.

186
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,020
It looks like a fake.

187
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,020
It's not a surprise at all.

188
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,020
Miss A-Si,

189
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,020
you mean someone

190
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,020
is pretending to be the brave man.

191
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,020
He is pretending to be the Yemingzhu of your Li's Mansion.

192
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,020
He wants to frame the case of the murder of the North Marquis.

193
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,020
He wants to frame the case of the North Marquis.

194
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,020
I'm sorry, Mr. Shun.

195
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,020
Our Li's Mansion is popular.

196
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,020
It's not surprising that someone framed us.

197
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,020
Besides,

198
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,020
they can even pretend to be the brave man.

199
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,020
Not to mention a seal.

200
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,020
But don't worry.

201
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,020
Since these shameless bandits

202
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,020
spread the dirty water to our Qian Kun Lane,

203
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,020
I, Li A-Si, will help you find out the truth.

204
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,020
I will help you find out the truth.

205
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,020
Thank you.

206
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,020
Thank you.

207
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,020
I'm leaving.

208
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,020
Do you think there is something wrong?

209
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,020
If so,

210
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,020
we should go to Li's Mansion in person.

211
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,020
We should go to Li's Mansion in person.

212
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,020
We should go to Li's Mansion in person.

213
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,020
You're not the only one who's in danger.

214
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,020
Li's Mansion is in danger.

215
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,020
What are you looking for?

216
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,020
Didn't Brother Jiang think it over?

217
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,020
Do you want to go and have a look?

218
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,020
You know me better.

219
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,020
Let's go to the guard's team

220
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,020
and go to the door of the warehouse

221
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,020
to find out the truth.

222
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,020
Master.

223
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,020
What's up?

224
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,020
There's an urgent letter from the outside.

225
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,020
It's about the Marquis of Dongwu's Mansion.

226
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,020
Give it to me.

227
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,020
Give it to me.

228
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,020
Why are you so anxious?

229
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,020
Why are you so anxious?

230
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,020
You even came to deliver a letter.

231
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,020
Marquis of Beibo

232
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,020
made a deal with Jiang Wenfeng?

233
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,020
Marquis of Beibo made a deal with Jiang Wenfeng?

234
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,020
It seems that the prince has lost his mind.

235
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,020
He's lost his mind.

236
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,020
You're so cunning.

237
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,020
I want to see if you're quick to find out

238
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,020
or if I'm quick to do it.

239
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,020
Master Li.

240
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,020
Let everyone do as planned.

241
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,020
Tonight's plan

242
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,020
I want all of you to die for my father.

243
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,020
Stop him!

244
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,020
Brother, who told you to come?

245
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,020
Brother, you saw it.

246
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,020
He committed suicide. I didn't kill him.

247
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,020
I didn't kill him.

248
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,020
I didn't kill him.

249
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,020
I didn't kill him.

250
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,020
I didn't kill him.

251
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,020
I didn't kill him.

252
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,020
He committed suicide. I didn't kill him.

253
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,020
Jiang Wenhuan was right.

254
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,020
Jiang Wenhuan was right.

255
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,020
Brother Jiang is really a wise man.

256
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,020
It seems that Jiang Wenhuan is getting closer to the truth.

257
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,020
It seems that Jiang Wenhuan is getting closer to the truth.

258
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,020
What did he ask us to do next?

259
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,020
He said he was going to the memorial service.

260
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,020
He said he was going to the memorial service.

261
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,020
Let's go.

262
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,020
Let's go.

263
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,020
How could it be him?

264
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,020
He's trying to find out the truth.

265
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,020
If Ziyu didn't die,

266
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,020
then Zi Ci must be doing it for revenge.

267
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,020
No.

268
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,020
Tonight is the last day.

269
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,020
I have to go back and tell Brother Zi Ci.

270
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,020
Let's go.

271
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,020
What?

272
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,020
You haven't seen him for days.

273
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,020
Brother Jiang is in such a hurry to leave.

274
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,020
Brother Jiang is in such a hurry to leave.

275
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,020
Ziyu.

276
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,020
You haven't seen him for days.

277
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,020
I didn't expect you to be the one behind it.

278
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,020
I didn't expect you to be the one behind it.

279
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,020
I advise you to stop it as soon as possible.

280
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,020
You escaped with your life.

281
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,020
Why do you want to kill yourself?

282
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,020
Jiang Wenhuan.

283
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,020
You are still so petty.

284
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,020
You are still so petty.

285
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,020
But now I, Ning Ziyu,

286
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,020
am the coward who doesn't hesitate.

287
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,020
And you, the criminals who killed my father,

288
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,020
And you, the criminals who killed my father,

289
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,020
will die in my hands tonight.

290
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,020
will die in my hands tonight.

291
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,020
You will die with my father.

292
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,020
Jiang Wenhuan.

293
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,020
Do you really think you can

294
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,020
go to my house freely?

295
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,020
No.

296
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,020
Jiang Wenhuan.

297
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,020
When you kidnapped my father,

298
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,020
you were so brave.

299
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,020
I didn't expect you to die in my hands.

300
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,020
Brother Luo.

301
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,020
Do you still remember

302
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,020
what I told you in the fight?

303
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,020
What I told you in the fight?

304
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,020
Surely.

305
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,020
This little fellow is both bad and stupid.

306
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,500
This attitude will never change

307
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,860
Jiang Wenhuan

308
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,460
Do you think you can escape with your tongue?

309
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,740
Since you personally sent yourself to me today

310
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,140
I definitely can't ruin your good intentions

311
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,660
Li Lao

312
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,260
Thank you

313
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,860
Guards

314
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,340
Chop them off

315
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,620
Stop

316
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,180
Put down the knife

317
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,060
Si'er

318
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,220
Let them go

319
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,540
Or I'll die in front of you

320
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,060
Li Lao

321
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,780
Don't forget our promise

322
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,780
If you're soft today

323
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,340
You'll ruin everything about Prime Minister Qian Kun

324
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,820
Si'er

325
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,980
Do you know what you're doing?

326
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,780
Take Miss away

327
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,660
Li Lao

328
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,380
I, Jiang Wenhuan

329
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,660
Am the son of the Marquis of East Wuhou

330
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,420
If anything goes wrong

331
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,180
In your Li's Mansion today

332
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,220
My brother will find out the truth

333
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,540
You and Prime Minister Qian

334
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,580
Don't try to escape

335
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,980
Shut up

336
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,380
You heard me

337
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,180
I'm going to kill you in Li's Mansion

338
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,580
Take them away

339
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,160
Go

340
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,720
Go

341
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,580
Li Lao is still a man of the old

342
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,620
With a violent manner

343
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,540
Don't worry

344
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,580
Gao Mei Ji is prepared.

345
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:20,580
You go first. I'll follow you.

346
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,580
You're late.

347
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,580
Young Master has been shot by the old man. He will be killed.

348
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,580
You're teaching me to do things again.

349
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,580
I just want to remind you, Young Master.

350
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,580
You're a big man. You don't need to be so modest.

351
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,580
I personally saw him burning.

352
00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:00,580
You're doubting me or you think I'm incompetent?

353
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,580
They think I'm incompetent.

354
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:10,580
You're not even looking down on me?

355
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,580
You don't need to be so modest.

356
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,580
We're on the same boat.

357
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,580
That's nice.

358
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,580
We have our own plans.

359
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,580
You're trying so hard to avenge me.

360
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,580
You're just trying to get the longevity pill.

361
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,580
I'm telling you.

362
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,580
If you can't avenge my father this time,

363
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:42,580
you won't get the longevity pill.

364
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,580
Let me be the knife of your Ghosts.

365
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,580
Don't forget your identity.

366
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:59,580
It seems that the Ning family is going to have no one left.

367
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,580
General Jiang, we'll take our leave.

368
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,580
Goodbye.

369
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,580
General, it's time to go.

370
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:16,580
That rascal, have you found him yet?

371
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,580
I've already told them.

372
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,580
If I see the Crown Prince, I'll report to you immediately.

373
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,580
Don't worry.

374
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,580
I've already told the people of the Crown Prince Camp to stay in the camp in case of any accident.

375
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:32,580
Young Master, it's too late if we don't leave now.

376
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,580
The matter of Chongyu Dance has caused panic.

377
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:41,580
There must be no more mistakes tonight.

378
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,580
Let's go.

379
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,580
Go.

380
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,580
Heaven's order is clear.

381
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,580
Take your son as your family.

382
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,580
When the son is born,

383
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,580
he will never die.

384
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,580
He will be remembered by generations.

385
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:37,580
The Goumei Ceremony begins now.

386
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,580
Go.

387
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,580
Go.

388
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,580
My son!

389
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,580
My son!

390
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,580
My son, are you all right?

391
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,580
My son.

392
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,580
You are indeed the master of the Qian Kun Prime.

393
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,580
You actually poisoned the army in Dongluo.

394
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,580
Since you've let me poison them,

395
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,580
why don't you just poison them to death?

396
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,580
Isn't it easy?

397
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,580
They died so quickly.

398
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,580
Isn't it a good thing for them?

399
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,580
This medicine will temporarily make them unconscious.

400
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,580
They will be able to focus after a while.

401
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:37,580
I want them to watch their loved ones die before themselves in the fire.

402
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,580
Are you all ready?

403
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,580
I'm ready.

404
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,580
Go.

405
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:23,580
I declare that the ceremony will begin now.

406
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,580
Who is it?

407
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,580
Xiao Zi Yu, we meet again.

408
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,580
We meet again.

409
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,580
Jiang Wen Huan, why didn't you die?

410
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,580
If it weren't for Miss Si's help,

411
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,580
I would have been in your hands this time.

412
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,580
Come out and save them.

413
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,580
You want to save them?

414
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,580
It's not that easy.

415
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,580
What are you doing?

416
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,580
If we don't stop, how dare you do this today?

417
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,580
Are you crazy?

418
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,580
If this is her, we won't be able to escape.

419
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,580
I will die with you tonight.

420
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,580
Father, the arrow is going to hit us. Hurry and come over.

421
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,580
Zi Er, be careful.

422
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,580
What are you doing?

423
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,580
Childe Ning, Si is my only daughter.

424
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,580
I can't let anything happen to her.

425
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,580
Jiang Xiu, come help.

426
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,580
It's too dangerous here. Let's move everyone out first.

427
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,580
Over there.

428
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,580
I've paid back the favor I owed Ning Bo Hou.

429
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,580
Now you want to hurt my daughter?

430
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,580
It's impossible.

431
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,580
You're a good person, but you're so arrogant.

432
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,580
Stop it, Childe Ning.

433
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,580
If that's the case, then we'll die together.

434
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,580
Ning Bo Yu, are you crazy?

435
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,580
Father!

436
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,580
Be careful!

437
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,580
Zi Er, hurry and leave!

438
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,580
Father!

439
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:33,580
You don't want to hurt my daughter!

440
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,580
Let's go. We have to save her. Hurry and save her.

441
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,580
Father!

442
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,580
Don't shoot me.

443
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,580
If you don't save her, I won't let you off.

444
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,580
Don't forget your past.

445
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,580
I don't have the chance to kill Zi Yu.

446
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,580
Zi Er, hurry and leave.

447
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,580
Father!

448
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,580
Hurry and leave!

449
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,580
Father!

450
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,580
Don't shoot me!

451
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,580
I don't want to die!

452
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:05,580
I don't want to die with you!

453
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,580
Someone, come!

454
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,580
Hurry and get everyone out!

455
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,580
There's someone under the stone!

456
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,580
Hurry and save them!

457
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,580
Okay!

458
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,580
Hurry and save them!

459
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,580
Father!

460
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,580
Let's go. Take them out.

461
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,580
Father!

462
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,580
Father!

463
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,580
Hurry and come here!

464
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,580
Father! Father, answer me!

465
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,580
There's still a duck here!

466
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,580
Father!

467
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,580
Father!

468
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,580
Father!

469
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,580
Father! Father!

470
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,580
Father!

471
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,580
Father!

472
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,580
Zi Er!

473
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,580
Father!

474
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,580
Why haven't you left? Hurry and leave!

475
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,580
Father, don't worry. I'll save you out right away.

476
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,580
Don't worry about me, Zi Er.

477
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,580
Hurry and leave! It's too dangerous here!

478
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,580
I won't leave!

479
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,580
The cave is about to collapse!

480
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,580
You can't leave together!

481
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,580
Father, hold onto this whip.

482
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,580
Hold onto this whip. I'll pull you out.

483
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,580
Hold on! Hold on!

484
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,580
This is...

485
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,580
This year's big birthday,

486
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,580
I was able to get Jin Xiu to wear a wedding dress

487
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,580
and leave with Zi Er.

488
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,580
I went to the south to go to the capital.

489
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,580
I was able to get Jin Xiu to wear a wedding dress

490
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,580
and leave with Zi Er.

491
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,580
I went to the south to go to the capital.

492
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,580
I was able to get Ming Zhu to wear a wedding dress

493
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,580
and leave with Zi Er.

494
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,580
I went to the west to go to the south to wear a wedding dress

495
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,580
and leave with Kun Xie.

496
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,580
I was able to leave with Zi Er.

497
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:29,580
So, Father, everything has been arranged for me.

498
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,580
Let's go.

499
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:55,580
Father, hold my hand!

500
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,580
Zi Er!

501
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,580
Hold my hand!

502
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,580
Stop being a father.

503
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,580
Hurry and leave!

504
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,580
Father!

505
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,580
Zi Er!

506
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,580
I won't leave!

507
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,580
I want to die with Father!

508
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,580
It's going to collapse!

509
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,580
Father!

510
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,580
Li A-Si!

511
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,580
I can't leave anymore.

512
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,580
I can't take care of you anymore.

513
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,580
Remember!

514
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,580
No matter what happens,

515
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,580
you must live on!

516
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,580
Father, hold my hand.

517
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,580
Hold my hand.

518
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,580
Chen Wang Guan!

519
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,580
Why are you still standing there?

520
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,580
Pull out A-Si!

521
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,580
Father!

522
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,580
Father!

523
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,580
I owe Dong Lu

524
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,580
for using this life to pay.

525
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,580
Zi Er doesn't know anything.

526
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,580
This has nothing to do with her!

527
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,580
Jiang Wang Guan, take good care of Zi Er.

528
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,580
Father, I can't leave anymore.

529
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,580
I can't leave anymore, Father.

530
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,580
I'm sorry.

531
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,580
Jiang Wang Guan!

532
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,580
You must let her live!

533
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,580
I'm sorry.

534
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,580
Dream comes true.

535
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,580
Year comes true.

536
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,580
Who will ask about the past?

537
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,580
The stars in the world

538
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,580
are like the stars.

539
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,580
The white-haired man is like the star.

540
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,580
The youthful man is like the shadow of the moon.

541
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:24,580
He is not ashamed of the world's ambition.

542
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:30,580
He is deeply and deeply in love with you.

543
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,580
Whose love is so deep

544
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:39,580
that it's so cold?

545
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,580
Whose love is so strong

546
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:46,580
that it's so cold?

547
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:49,580
Time flies.

548
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:53,580
Change the fate.

549
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,580
The new couple

550
00:35:55,580 --> 00:36:00,580
opens the door.

551
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:03,580
I ask the king if he has ever heard

552
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,580
that the half-god is a lie.

553
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,580
He is deeply and deeply in love with you.

554
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:13,500
He is not afraid of the world's

555
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,580
empty city.

556
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:18,580
May the hatred and greed turn into

557
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:22,580
a spell.

558
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,580
I wish to enter the world

559
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:29,580
and protect the city.

560
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,580
I want to be the most

561
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:50,580
young man in the world

562
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:54,580
in this life.
