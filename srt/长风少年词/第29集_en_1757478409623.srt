00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We've drunk together.

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We've been brothers who have been punished and killed.

10
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000

Already died

46
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,400

47
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,160
It goes back to you

48
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,400
I didn't lie to you, did I?

49
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
The things I did were all beautiful.

50
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Don't cry.

51
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
I'm sorry.

52
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,400
I'm lonely in the middle of the world.

53
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
I...

54
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,400

55
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400

The snow in the south is called snow?

60
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,400
The snow in the south is called snow?

61
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,400
If you're lucky enough to see it, you'll understand what I mean.

62
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,400
It's my fault.

63
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,400
I saw the snow in the middle.

64
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400

I'm afraid I can't be with you for the rest of my life.

98

00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,280
Brother Jiang,

121
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,440
I've asked around.

122
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,720
Gongsun Wuyi and Taotie Army

123
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,920
have retreated from Zhongli City.

124
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:32,920
Okay.

125
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,240
Thank you.

126
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,560
How about

127
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,040
I go with you?

128
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,720
Although Gongsun Wuyi has retreated,

129
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,120
it's still not safe in the city.

130
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,800
You stay in the capital

131
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,560
and take care of your brothers and people.

132
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,720
Brother Jiang.

133
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,440
Take me

134
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,640
to say goodbye to Kunwu.

135
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,160
I've never thought

136
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,960
that life-long wandering

137
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,760
and falling into the abilities of Zhongli monkey

138
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,160
would lead me to the end.

139
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,100
If

140
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,860
the death of Gongsun Wuyi

141
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,800
at the tomb

142
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,440
on the road

143
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,840
a few years ago

144
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,400
was founders

145
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,640
The Kun family has not changed.

146
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,760
Zhong Li is still the same.

147
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:10,160
What will the young general of the Kun family look like?

148
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,880
Father, I'm back!

149
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,200
Brother, you're back!

150
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Wu Er!

151
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
Mother!

152
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,200
Brother, you're back!

153
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,800
This is your first time on the battlefield.

154
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,080
Fatty!

155
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,560
As a Kun army, you must defend Zhong Li.

156
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,760
What are you afraid of?

157
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,360
Good!

158
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,560
Good job!

159
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,360
The food is ready. Let's go back to our room.

160
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,560
Okay, Madam.

161
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,120
Brother, what present did you bring Qingqing?

162
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,600
Look at this.

163
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,400
Qingniang!

164
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,120
Brother, why do you look so pale?

165
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,640
You're going to marry today, not to fight.

166
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,040
Let's go!

167
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,320
Aunt! Brother!

168
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,120
You're finally back!

169
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,120
It's good that you're back.

170
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,040
Ying, you don't know.

171
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,880
This guy...

172
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,200
He's won the battle.

173
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,120
He's done a great job.

174
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,200
Enough.

175
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,840
What are you two wearing?

176
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,960
Come in and take a look.

177
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,920
That's right.

178
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,440
It stinks!

179
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,600
Who's the smelly one?

180
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,600
I said you're smelly.

181
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Give me back my sword!

182
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,200
I won't.

183
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,680
They thought...

184
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,320
they even defeated Wei Kolon.

185
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,400
They defeated Tushan and Guifang.

186
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,400
Howowitz.

187
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
First, if I should dare it to be Stop Turning Away...

188
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,200
Princess H background,

189
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,400
and the Ghost Realm.

190
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,320
But they didn't know

191
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,760
that you and I

192
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,920
are the strongest

193
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,680
and the most powerful of the Ghost Realm.

194
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,640
And that is

195
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,520
as long as you are here,

196
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,520
I will never fail.

197
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,720
I know you can't forgive me.

198
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,520
But

199
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,040
I want to take the life of Gongsun Wu Yu.

200
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,240
Gongsun Wu Yu

201
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,440
has brought back the Yi-Demon to me.

202
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,040
He told me about the way I practiced the

203
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,560
Immortality Pill.

204
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,960
I found it in the place where the Yi-Demon died.

205
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,240
It was also where I met Anash.

206
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,040
I don't know.

207
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,640
But I have a question.

208
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,680
Before the Yi-Demon died,

209
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,000
he wanted to collect the medicine

210
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,040
to leave an injury to Anash.

211
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,040
And that medicine

212
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,400
is exactly the same as the poison

213
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
that cured you.

214
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,440
You are right.

215
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,440
I don't know.

216
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,440
I don't know.

217
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,440
I don't know.

218
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,440
I don't know.

219
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,440
I don't know.

220
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,440
I don't know.

221
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,440
I don't know.

222
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,440
I don't know.

223
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,440
I don't know.

224
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,440
It's the same.

225
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,080
Anash was poisoned.

226
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,880
Hao Qi.

227
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,920
He has never been alive.

228
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,640
In today's battle,

229
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,760
I wonder how Lord Gongsun

230
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,760
will explain to His Majesty.

231
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,520
What do you mean?

232
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,240
When the imperial edict was sent,

233
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,240
I advised you to think twice.

234
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,360
But you just acted on your own will

235
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,760
and made such a mess.

236
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,160
Taotie Army has been injured more than half.

237
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,960
This is unprecedented.

238
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,960
This is not what His Majesty wants to see.

239
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,040
What is the next

240
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,160
battle between you two?

241
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,440
We will report to His Majesty

242
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,880
the current situation.

243
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,560
Besides, Taotie Army

244
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,560
is not Lord Gongsun's private army.

245
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,560
How will we fight the battle?

246
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,960
We will command it.

247
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,960
Please take care of yourself.

248
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,560
I can't help.

249
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,960
Good.

250
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,960
But don't worry about reporting to His Majesty.

251
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,360
The real battle

252
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,160
has just begun.

253
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,960
What do you mean?

254
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:49,900
You are...

255
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,420
Why Taotie Sun?

256
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,120
My son

257
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,640
You've woken up.

258
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,600
If the heavens don't do justice,

259
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,200
I'll do justice for them.

260
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,020
Today, in my Tushan Academy,

261
00:22:51,600 --> 00:23:04,680
I actually cues Heaven and

262
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,640
Just wait.

263
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,360
Please

264
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
see from here.

265
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,000
You've been searching for the Long-Living Deity medicine turns to be very powerful.

266
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,360
Young Master, you've worked hard.

267
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,760
Have some soup.

268
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,240
We'll continue to kill the enemies later.

269
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,440
Thank you so much.

270
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,840
You're heroes.

271
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,080
You've suffered a lot.

272
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,600
Congratulations, young masters.

273
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,320
Thank you.

274
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,920
Let's go back.

275
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,360
Okay.

276
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,360
Young Master.

277
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,720
Take care.

278
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,920
Let's go back.

279
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,880
Take care, young master.

280
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,120
Dong Lu Jun can reach Zhongli City

281
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,120
when the dawn breaks.

282
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,800
As long as we hold off Taotie Army tonight,

283
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,640
we'll win.

284
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,400
Taotie Army was half damaged in the previous battle.

285
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,000
Why don't we chase them?

286
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,800
No.

287
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,200
Taotie Army was suddenly withdrawn in the previous battle.

288
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,200
It was too smooth.

289
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,240
We can't let them win.

290
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,440
We can't let them win.

291
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,440
We can't let them win.

292
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,440
We can't let them win.

293
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,520
From what I know about Gongsun Wu Yu,

294
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,720
he must be well prepared.

295
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,280
I'm worried.

296
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,240
You mean...

297
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,440
Anashi...

298
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,120
Anashi died 16 years ago.

299
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,720
Gongsun Wu Yu has been protecting his body

300
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,240
and never left it.

301
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,520
I'm afraid Anashi

302
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,360
is related to the monster

303
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,800
that Immortal Immortal said.

304
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,320
And the valley of Sujia Village.

305
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,680
Once the valley is destroyed,

306
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,200
the nine states will be destroyed.

307
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,520
The ancient wounds can control the people who turn into monsters.

308
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,000
Of course,

309
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,800
they can control the bodies that turn into monsters.

310
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,480
If the Taotie Army that has been in the past

311
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,960
is a monster that lives or dies,

312
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,120
we'll lose tonight.

313
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,920
We'll lose tonight.

314
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,200
Even if we lose,

315
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,400
we must fight to the end.

316
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,080
Let's finish the Poetryے

317
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,040
by training that person,

318
00:26:50,720 --> 00:27:08,480
don't forget your 1988

319
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,920
years.

320
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,520
the last line of the Zhongli Palace.

321
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,000
The people in the palace

322
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,680
will be left to you.

323
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,160
And we

324
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,600
will protect this gate

325
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,240
for you no matter we live or die.

326
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,320
Jiang Wen Hua.

327
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,080
Go.

328
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,160
Go.

329
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,640
From now on,

330
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,480
no matter what happens,

331
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,760
everyone except me

332
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,680
will be killed by this gate.

333
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,200
Nowalong you can't do that.

334
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,880
Close the gate.

335
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,680
Jiang Wen Hua.

336
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,280
You must come back.

337
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,680
Tonight,

338
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,240
we'll fight back.

339
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,240
I may slander the Ma Ke Fruit.

340
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,640
But a man

341
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,240
is a man who can't be

342
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,640
looked down upon.

343
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,640
No matter what,

344
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,040
keep our promise.

345
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,040
Protect the one we want to protect.

346
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,040
We won't let anyone get in our way.

347
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,040
Protect the people.

348
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,640
We won't back down.

349
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,040
Protect the people.

350
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,440
We won't back down.

351
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,240
Protect the people.

352
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,040
We won't back down.

353
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,640
Why did Gongsun Wu Yu

354
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,240
get so many people

355
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,440
in one night?

356
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,440
These Taotie Army

357
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,240
don't look normal.

358
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,240
What's this?

359
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,640
It's a target.

360
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,240
Could it be that, as you guessed,

361
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,640
Gongsun Wu Yu has already

362
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,640
trained the target

363
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,840
in one night?

364
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,840
Gongsun Wu Yu wants to

365
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,440
serve the people of Sheng An

366
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,440
and train all the dead soldiers

367
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,240
into a life-and-death army.

368
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,040
The immortals and demons in Gongsun Wu Yu's hands

369
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,640
are the Anas.

370
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,440
The Anas

371
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,640
are the key to

372
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,040
training the eight demons.

373
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,240
Now the enemy

374
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,440
can't even stop the people.

375
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,040
How do we fight this?

376
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,040
Do you remember

377
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,040
Xue Jing is a person

378
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,040
who only knows how to train the eight demons?

379
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,240
With Jing Shi as a man,

380
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,840
we can kill all the demons.

381
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,040
When we rush,

382
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,440
the drum will sound.

383
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,240
Everyone, wait for Er Sai.

384
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,440
In this battle,

385
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,240
we will fight with our hearts.

386
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,640
I'm not a dead man.

387
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,040
The world is a cage.

388
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,840
The golden drum will be broken.

389
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,840
We are brothers.

390
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,840
We will never be defeated.

391
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,240
Kill!

392
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,040
Kill!

393
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,640
Kill!

394
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,840
Do you really think

395
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,240
you can defeat Xue Jing Shi?

396
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,640
Kill!

397
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,240
What's wrong?

398
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,240
What's wrong?

399
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,240
What's wrong?

400
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,440
They won't attack us?

401
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,440
Don't panic.

402
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,440
Cover your ears.

403
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,640
I'm afraid

404
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,040
these children

405
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,240
can't resist anymore.

406
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,040
They won't.

407
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,640
They won't.

408
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,640
They won't.

409
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,640
They won't.

410
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,640
They won't.

411
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,640
They won't.

412
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,640
They won't.

413
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,640
They won't.

414
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,640
They won't.

415
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,640
They won't.

416
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,240
They will.

417
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,640
Your Majesty.

418
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,640
This time,

419
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,240
I didn't embarrass you.

420
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,640
Wang Yuan Ji.

421
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,640
Wang Yuan Ji!

422
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,640
Father, are you afraid of death?

423
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,040
General died for nothing.

424
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,640
He died for nothing.

425
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,040
It's all because of death.

426
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,040
Kill me!

427
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,040
Miss, wait!

428
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,240
Miss,

429
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,640
we're going to fight the battle with you.

430
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,640
Zhongli City

431
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,240
is the home of all of us.

432
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,240
Protecting our home

433
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,640
is what we, the people of Zhongli,

434
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,040
should do.

435
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,640
No.

436
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,040
You're just

437
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,640
ordinary people

438
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,640
guarding the village.

439
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,040
You'll die for nothing if you go.

440
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,440
In order to protect our home,

441
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,840
what's the use of

442
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,840
dying?

443
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,440
Protecting our home!

444
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,040
Protecting our home!

445
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,640
Protecting our home!

446
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,440
Protecting our home!

447
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,840
We'll fight back!

448
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,040
Kill them!

449
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,840
Brother Jiang, Brother Chong,

450
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,040
I'll open the way for you.

451
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,040
And us.

452
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,040
Kill them!

453
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,640
I can't stop the poison of the Eight Devils.

454
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,240
You're not going to die.

455
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,240
You're not going to die.

456
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,640
The battle is about to start.

457
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,040
The enemy has already broken the human skull.

458
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,040
Anas is protecting the human skull.

459
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,440
If we get close to him,

460
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,840
the Eight Devils will attack us.

461
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,440
This is the only way.

462
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,040
If we want to break the valley,

463
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,640
we must kill Anas first.

464
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,640
I'll kill you!

465
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,440
It's not easy to kill my son.

466
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,840
Leave Anas to me.

467
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,840
You go to break the human skull.

468
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,840
I'll go to break the human skull.

469
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,440
Dream comes true.

470
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,240
Thought comes true.

471
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,840
Who will ask about the past?

472
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:49,440
The stars in the world are like the stars.

473
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,440
The white-clad man is like the white-clad man.

474
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,040
The youthful man is like the youthful man.

475
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,640
No one is ashamed of the unwavering love of the world.

476
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:06,840
The hatred is deep and thick.

477
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,600
Who is known for being fair,

478
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,040
being a god ofrules,

479
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:14,040
and challengingatae with laborious runes?

480
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,840
Who is known for not fading away

481
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:21,200
and solidifying itself year by year?

482
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,440
Turning around at a young age,

483
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,440
I will exchange an actions for an warriors' blessing.

484
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,040
The зрer who brought me a passenger

485
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:35,040
opened the door of the Yishan Gate.

486
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,560
Your呀

487
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,060

492
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,120
Wait at night

493
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,640

494
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:22,440
