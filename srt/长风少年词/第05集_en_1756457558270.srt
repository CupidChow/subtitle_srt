1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We are willing to be good friends, but we will never stop loving each other.

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,600
We will never give up on our hearts and the world.

3
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,400
We will only reach the end of our hearts,

4
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,000
until our fates are finally broken.

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We will never stop.

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 16

7
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,800
All of you, catch them!

8
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,600
Stop!

9
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Miss. Miss.

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,600
You... You are not...

11
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,600
What? You don't remember me that soon?

12
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Bride?

13
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,200
This...

14
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,200
Brother Jiang,

15
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,400
you know Miss Qian Kun Xiang. Why didn't you tell me earlier?

16
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,200
We are all family. Why are you making such a fuss?

17
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,200
Stop talking.

18
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
I have nothing to do with her.

19
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
Nothing to do with her?

20
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,200
You don't, do you?

21
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,400
I think your relationship with her is very different.

22
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,600
Miss A-Se, we came here not to make a fuss,

23
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
but to do something important.

24
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,000
I remember your kindness to save me.

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You can say whatever you want.

26
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,600
Sit down.

27
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,400
We came here to find the lost Golden Fish Horse.

28
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,000
Miss A-Se,

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,400
the Golden Fish Horse that you lost?

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,600
It's the pure and pure horse of Xukun Pavilion.

31
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:44,400
Actually, it's not hard to find the horse-riding person.

32
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,200
Really?

33
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,600
Where is my Qian Kun Xiang?

34
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,600
There is no news from Qian Kun Xiang in Donglu City.

35
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,400
A group of horse-riding people want to sneak away from me.

36
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
It's impossible.

37
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,600
Are you sure they ran in this direction?

38
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,600
We never miss any news from Qian Kun Xiang.

39
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,400
Have you checked the recent records of Donglu City?

40
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,000
I asked Xin Jia to check with Chong Yi Biao.

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Why didn't Chong Yi Biao come today?

42
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,200
Chong Yi Biao insisted on checking by himself.

43
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,400
He hasn't told us the news yet.

44
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,800
Thank you for the birthday party.

45
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,800
Oh, right. I didn't know it was so precious.

46
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Now I know. I'll return it to you.

47
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,600
You gave it away. How can you take it back?

48
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,200
Wait.

49
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
There's blood in front.

50
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,400
Where is this?

51
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,600
This is my back door.

52
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,200
Oh.

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,400
Master, someone suspicious was found outside the back door.

54
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,600
Kill him.

55
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,800
Yes.

56
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,400
Old Wu Li, you want to kill me?

57
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,600
My precious daughter, why did you come back from the back door?

58
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,200
I'm joking with you.

59
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,600
If someone dares to touch you,

60
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,400
I'll kill him.

61
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,400
Old Wu Li, sorry to disturb you at night. Please forgive me.

62
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,800
ICK

63
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,700
The blood kg of thebildman

64
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,500
must have been from the back door of Li Manor.

65
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,500
Father!

66
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Si!

67
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
You guys, go find the thief!

68
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,500
Father!

69
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,500
Father!

70
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Father!

71
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
Father!

72
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Father!

73
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
It's all my fault.

74
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,500
If Father didn't want to save me,

75
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
he wouldn't have been hurt by that thief.

76
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
I'm sorry, Elder Li.

77
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,500
You don't have to be sorry.

78
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,500
It's just a pity

79
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
that that thief ran away.

80
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
I have a question.

81
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,500
I've heard that the enemy is skilled in martial arts.

82
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
How could he be easily hurt by a thief?

83
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Jiang Wen Hua,

84
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
what do you mean?

85
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
You suspect that my father colluded with the thief

86
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,500
to steal your horse?

87
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,500
No.

88
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,500
I'm right beside my father

89
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
when he was hurt by the thief.

90
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Don't take advantage of my father's feelings.

91
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
We don't welcome people like you.

92
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Get out.

93
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
I just think that the thief...

94
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,500
Sorry to bother you today.

95
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
I'll see you again.

96
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,500
What happened just now

97
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
was not right, right?

98
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
If I lied to you on purpose,

99
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
what's the point of it?

100
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
Brother, you're really a man of your word.

101
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
What happened today was really strange.

102
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,500
The thief

103
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
clearly knew Li's Mansion well.

104
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,500
The Li family is suspicious.

105
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,500
But it's the army's loyalty.

106
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
If no one is willing to accept it,

107
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
how could it be easy?

108
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
You mean

109
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
someone is trying to steal your horse?

110
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
Yes.

111
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,500
But I don't think

112
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
it's a good idea.

113
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,500
You mean

114
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
someone is trying to make peace with them?

115
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
The army of Eastland is always

116
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
in the eyes of the army.

117
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
Could it be the people of the Eagle Division?

118
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,500
It's impossible.

119
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,500
People are cruel.

120
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
It's unpredictable.

121
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Could it be the people of the Eagle Division?

122
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
Is there any clue

123
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
about the entry and exit records?

124
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,500
I've checked the entry and exit records

125
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
of the past half year.

126
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,500
There's no suspicious person.

127
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,500
Brother Jiang!

128
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,500
Brother Jiang!

129
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,500
I found the horse.

130
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
Where did you find it?

131
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,500
We've been looking for it for a whole day.

132
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
When we were returning to the camp,

133
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
we found it in the woods nearby.

134
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
It's completely harmless.

135
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,500
In the woods nearby?

136
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,500
It's not a good thing.

137
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
It's not a good thing.

138
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,500
It's not a good thing.

139
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,500
Let's go and comfort the little bag.

140
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Has the old tree been in the shadow?

141
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
Report!

142
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,500
Your Highness!

143
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,500
The army of the army is not lost.

144
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,500
The map of the city of Eastland has been stolen.

145
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,500
What?

146
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,500
The map?

147
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,500
What?

148
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,500
The map?

149
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,500
Fish soup?

150
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,500
Doesn't Father not like fish?

151
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,500
It's strange.

152
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,860
Cut it out

153
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,140
Two

154
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,580
One

155
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,420
Yes

156
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,840
Good

157
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,960
He's been a playboy for a long time.

158
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,560
It seems that he's the one who's obsessed with horse-riding.

159
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,960
He asked us to go out and steal the map while the camp is empty.

160
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,120
No wonder when we were leaving the camp,

161
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,440
Brother Yao suddenly had a stomachache

162
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,240
and went back to the camp.

163
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,360
No wonder.

164
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,240
You found the horse on your way back.

165
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,840
As expected,

166
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,520
the war horse is not his main enemy.

167
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,960
But I still don't understand

168
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,320
why Yao Shuliang stole the map.

169
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,400
He's just a young man from the small country on the east.

170
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,800
If there's no Eastland to protect him,

171
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,840
his motherland would have been swarmed by the Japanese.

172
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,200
What's the use of the map?

173
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,680
Oh no.

174
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,880
They're going to attack the Eastland.

175
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,160
Who?

176
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,240
The Japanese.

177
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,520
It's the Japanese again.

178
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,240
The one who colluded with Ning Bohou was the Japanese.

179
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,080
But Jiang Xiu,

180
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,760
what's the grudge between you and the Japanese?

181
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,560
Do you remember what General Jiang Ke said?

182
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,000
The city defense of the Eastland Army is different from the other places.

183
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,800
It's designed according to the map of the river.

184
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,240
The first is the wine, the second is the horse, the third is the horse,

185
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,560
the fourth is the sword,

186
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,920
the sixth is the horse, the eighth is the horse, the fifth is the horse.

187
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,000
Each line is connected to the river.

188
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,040
The map of the river?

189
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,200
Brother Jiang,

190
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,800
isn't your Eastland City Defense Map

191
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,240
the same as my gambling cards?

192
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,000
It's just that my gambling cards have six levels of five levels.

193
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,520
And the map of the city defense is exactly the opposite.

194
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,000
It's a one-level nine.

195
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,600
That's right.

196
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,680
Your gambling cards are the same as mine.

197
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,760
It's the meaning of the change of this map of the river.

198
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,400
Interesting.

199
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,840
As long as the city defense of the Eastland Army is not broken for a day,

200
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,240
the Japanese will not get any benefits for a day.

201
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,200
The Eastland Army is the border of the eastern border.

202
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,640
The Japanese have been attacking for years.

203
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,920
They know they can't be defeated.

204
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,200
But the Japanese have always been reckless.

205
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,840
They will fight if they want to.

206
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,360
This time,

207
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,920
they actually want the city defense map of the Shizi Camp.

208
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,160
It must be for better use.

209
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,960
If they get the map of the city defense,

210
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
then the Eastland Army...

211
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,360
The Eastland Army is in danger.

212
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,160
It's not a matter of

213
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,760
our concern to the assassins.

214
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,320
I know.

215
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,720
But I'm afraid

216
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,200
Yao Shuliang will die.

217
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,960
What does it have to do with me?

218
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,120
I only know that

219
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,360
if we don't report it,

220
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,920
it will implicate everyone and the whole Eastland Army.

221
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,680
The Eastland Army is my motherland.

222
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,040
I'm more anxious than anyone else.

223
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,320
Is it worth it for a deserter?

224
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,720
There are many doubts in the gold.

225
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,000
If the guards find out,

226
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,440
they will be accused of treason.

227
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,520
He will also be punished with bloodshed.

228
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,000
I believe Yao Shuliang is not that kind of person.

229
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,160
He is just pretending.

230
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,880
Now,

231
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,280
we must find Yao Shuliang tonight

232
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,080
to break this trap.

233
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:06,960
Stay away from me.

234
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,760
Who... who wants to be with you?

235
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,560
Get out of the way.

236
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,280
Why is the horse's hoof gone?

237
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,280
Then...

238
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,480
How do we know?

239
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,440
This way.

240
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,480
How do you know?

241
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,520
Tell me.

242
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,400
There are few stones for a crossing tonight.

243
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,560
They all end up in the white Market Street.

244
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,280
No one else is here,

245
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,160
but me.

246
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,360
Two marquises have the ability to do such a thing?

247
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,400
As if.

248
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,160
Hey, Heshun,

249
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,280
this is called complicated Quantitative Warfare.

250
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,640
How about you?

251
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,520
Like you?

252
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,600
You...

253
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,480
Fine, get down on your way.

254
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:35,140
Offer the

255
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,760
to League Is lightłem co é

256
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,800
Let's go

257
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,720
Team four

258
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,200
Bring me the rope

259
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,360
It's like this

260
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,520
Still want to talk

261
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:55,880
Little paper bag

262
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,280
Wait for me to untie the rope

263
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,880
Let's Linux깟

264
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,360
who can see Er onboard the

265
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,840
First grade...

266
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,840
can knew 없es?

267
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,840
Chen Higher,

268
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,420
it's not in the moral опредathers' hands.

269
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,260
I have already slept with Chen.

270
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,060
No.

271
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,080
Congratulations to the best concubine.

272
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,640
I just want to help them.

273
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,400
Anyway,

274
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,080
it's a long way from Jiang Wenhuan.

275
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,760
Miss, we found the clue to the horse thief.

276
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,800
But Jiang Gongzi and the others...

277
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,720
What are you doing?

278
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,000
You're so flustered.

279
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,800
When we found the clue to the horse thief,

280
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,000
we found that Jiang Gongzi and the others...

281
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,440
What do you mean, Mr. Jiang?

282
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,320
We're talking about the murderer of my father.

283
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,400
Yes, the murderer.

284
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,600
The murderer and his men

285
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,040
disappeared from the forest.

286
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,920
I'm afraid

287
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,640
the murderer is very dangerous.

288
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,720
General Jiang.

289
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,480
General.

290
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,080
What's going on?

291
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,520
Mr. Jiang and the scholars are missing.

292
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,000
What?

293
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,200
Jiang Wenhuan and the others went to the forest?

294
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,560
No wonder we searched the city

295
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,560
but we didn't find them.

296
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,640
Yes.

297
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,640
General Jiang, now we...

298
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,560
General.

299
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,480
General.

300
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,160
What's wrong?

301
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,280
The border has changed.

302
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,800
The ghost has entered the city.

303
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,480
If so,

304
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,840
Mr. Gongzi,

305
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,040
the second general of Chen Wang

306
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,120
will go to the city to check the situation.

307
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,400
Tai Dian, listen to me.

308
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:51,920
Yes.

309
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,040
You four

310
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,080
go to the forest to find the traces of Jiang Wenhuan.

311
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,120
If anything goes wrong, report it to me in time.

312
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:57,840
Yes.

313
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,760
General, don't worry.

314
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,320
Something happened.

315
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,560
Something happened.

316
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,200
Stop.

317
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,160
The military flag is at the center.

318
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,920
Please stop.

319
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,440
General Jiang.

320
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,720
Something happened to your young master Jiang Wenhuan.

321
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,160
If you don't come out,

322
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,600
Jiang Wenhuan will be killed.

323
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,160
What about here?

324
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,240
Jiang Wenhuan is in trouble.

325
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,480
What happened?

326
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,760
Jiang Wenhuan is in danger.

327
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:21,960
What should we do?

328
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,720
Mr. Jiang.

329
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,280
How are you?

330
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,280
Who are you?

331
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,280
Why are you so restless?

332
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,320
What a good trick.

333
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,360
If I'm not wrong,

334
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,640
the horse is just a trick to lure the tiger away from the mountain.

335
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,880
The purpose is to take advantage of the empty space in the camp

336
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,440
to let Yang Shuliang

337
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,800
steal the city's defense and take the opportunity.

338
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,440
You are really smart.

339
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,280
I heard that Donglu City has a strict defense layout.

340
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,480
If you break in rashly,

341
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,960
you will be caught.

342
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,880
I have been fighting with Donglu for many years.

343
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,240
I dare not take the risk.

344
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,920
You have got the map.

345
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,720
Why do you have to do this?

346
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,080
Why do you take me here?

347
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,120
You take the map from PDF?

348
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,720
Just because of Yang Shuliang's

349
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:34,960
is not雪

350
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,920
how to know whether you are deliberately to release the mysterious things?

351
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,440
So you played resultlessly

352
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,520
because you took me to draw the map for you?

353
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,400
It's not you.

354
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,680
It's you two.

355
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,840
Your companions

356
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,840
If one of you is fake,

357
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,840
and you paint differently than others,

358
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,840
you will be executed immediately.

359
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,840
But if you all want to live,

360
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,840
there is only one way.

361
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,840
It is to paint all the real pictures.

362
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,840
I advise Mr. Jiang

363
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,840
not to play tricks anymore.

364
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,840
Your brothers

365
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,840
have already drawn the brush.

366
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,840
Your brothers have already drawn the brush.

367
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,840
Your brothers have already drawn the brush.

368
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,840
Your brothers have already drawn the brush.

369
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,840
Your brothers have already drawn the brush.

370
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,840
I have to paint it.

371
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,840
Brother,

372
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,840
I didn't remember anything.

373
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,840
I was sleeping in class and I didn't hear anything.

374
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,840
What if I paint the real picture

375
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,840
and others paint the fake picture?

376
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,840
What if I paint the fake picture and others paint the fake picture?

377
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,840
Four military branches are different.

378
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,840
How do you distinguish them?

379
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,840
So,

380
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,840
you want me to give my life

381
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,840
to him?

382
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,840
Mr. Jiang.

383
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,840
Please.

384
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,840
How is it?

385
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,840
You finished all so quickly.

386
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,840
Get out!

387
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,340
Hurry up and go!

388
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,840
Guards!

389
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,340
You really are all troublemakers.

390
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,340
I think your East Mound is not just a piece of steel anymore.

391
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:27,340
I didn't expect that these five pictures are exactly the same.

392
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,340
Good.

393
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,340
It seems that you, the princes and nobles, are just like this.

394
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,840
You are all cowards who are greedy for life.

395
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,340
As long as you have this city defense map in your hands,

396
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,840
you can be a good man.

397
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,340
I'm not afraid of you.

398
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,840
As long as you have this city defense map in your hands,

399
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,840
the Gui Fang State will attack the East Mound.

400
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,840
You can wait for the day.

401
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,340
You are so forgetful.

402
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,340
Don't be too happy too soon.

403
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,340
If you have the ability, you can fight with me.

404
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,340
Shut up!

405
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,840
You are still so stubborn even when you are about to die.

406
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,840
It seems that the East Mound is really a bad idea.

407
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,340
Teacher, I already said that these are all true.

408
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,340
Really?

409
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,840
Now...

410
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,340
Now you can let us go, right?

411
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,840
Let you go?

412
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,840
The Gui Fang's elite soldiers are waiting for the news at the East Mound.

413
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,840
Let you go back?

414
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,840
So that you can get the news?

415
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,340
Teacher! Teacher!

416
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,840
No, I promise I won't cause any trouble.

417
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,340
I won't cause any trouble.

418
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,840
How about...

419
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,840
How about...

420
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,340
You kill them first?

421
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,340
Even I die alone?

422
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,340
I can show you the way.

423
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,340
You little rascal.

424
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,340
I didn't expect you to be so bold.

425
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,340
You are so cruel.

426
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,840
Sir!

427
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,840
I was blind.

428
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,340
I helped you find the horse.

429
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,340
Now you are in this place.

430
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,840
I am a ghost.

431
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,840
I will drag you into the water.

432
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,840
Sir.

433
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,840
You should kill them, sir.

434
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,840
Get out of my way!

435
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,840
What's going on?

436
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,840
I have no time to be with you rascals.

437
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,840
Retreat!

438
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,840
Chase!

439
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,340
Miss A-Si.

440
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,840
Are you sure Brother Wen Fang is not here?

441
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,340
He is in the temple nearby.

442
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,840
Thanks to Miss A-Si for the news.

443
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,840
I will go to find him.

444
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,840
I will go to find him.

445
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,840
I will go to find him.

446
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,840
I will go to find him.

447
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,840
Thanks to Miss A-Si for the news.

448
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,840
Brother Wen Fang is so lucky.

449
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,840
Miss A-Si is his best friend.

450
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,340
Who knows?

451
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,340
I just owe him half of my life.

452
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,840
I just owe him half of my life.

453
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,340
Look.

454
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,840
Is there a temple ahead?

455
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,340
Let's look around.

456
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,840
No.

457
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,840
That ghost was in this room.

458
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,840
Why is it gone so fast?

459
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,840
He even broke the door.

460
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,340
This is the secret room.

461
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,340
Only the hidden secret door can be used to get out.

462
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,340
Then we won't be trapped here and can't get out, right?

463
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,840
There is a secret room.

464
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,340
This room has the sound of the wind blowing.

465
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,840
There is also water.

466
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,340
I will definitely get out.

467
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,340
Wait.

468
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,840
Yang Shuling.

469
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,340
Which group are you?

470
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,340
You want to kill us and save us.

471
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,340
You are making me confused.

472
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,840
Brother Xia.

473
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,840
Why don't you understand?

474
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,840
I am exactly the same as the picture you drew.

475
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,840
I am even more confused when you say this picture.

476
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,340
I clearly drew a fake one.

477
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,340
Could it be that I remembered it wrongly?

478
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,840
I drew a real one.

479
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,840
If you want to draw the same fake picture,

480
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,840
there is only one way.

481
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,840
That is to say, everyone has seen the copy of this fake picture.

482
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,340
My He Luo gambling board is made of ancient painting.

483
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,340
He Luo gambling board sounds scary.

484
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,340
Then your Dongwu's city square picture

485
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,340
is the same as my gambling board.

486
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,340
In order to fake the real one,

487
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,340
I had to draw a fake picture according to He Luo gambling board.

488
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,340
Fortunately, everyone thought of it together.

489
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,340
When I was testing the picture,

490
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,340
a little crybaby gave me a hint.

491
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,840
I looked for an opportunity and took the chance.

492
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,840
This game can win.

493
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,840
The king of gambling in Xichuan is invincible.

494
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,340
I told you.

495
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,840
A little gambling is a little love.

496
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,340
You are a blind cat.

497
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,840
Did you hear any sound?

498
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,340
I think I found the door.

499
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
Oh no.

500
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,840
It's Xue Yang.

501
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,340
Why is there no one?

502
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,340
I heard the sound of the door.

503
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,340
I think I heard the sound of the door.

504
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,840
Why is there no one?

505
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,340
Yes, there is no one.

506
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,340
Are we late?

507
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,340
They may have left.

508
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,340
God bless me.

509
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,840
God bless me.

510
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,340
I am still alive and well

511
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,340
for the beauty of the world.

512
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,840
I can die here, Zhou You.

513
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,840
Wasting your energy

514
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,340
and dying faster.

515
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,340
What should we do now?

516
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,840
Are we really going to die here?

517
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,340
Enough, little old man.

518
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,340
Don't you think there is not enough water?

519
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,840
Can you stop crying?

520
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,840
Let's go to another place.

521
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,340
Go.

522
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,840
Wait.

523
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,840
There has been no rainwater in Donglu City for a long time.

524
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,840
Why is the ground wet?

525
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,340
Please help me.

526
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,840
Remove these two bricks.

527
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,340
There is indeed a problem.

528
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,840
Please dig this place.

529
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,840
Brother Chong, my chest is so stuffy.

530
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,340
I can't breathe.

531
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,840
If you want to live,

532
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,840
just shut up.

533
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,340
Come down.

534
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,340
Brother.

535
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,340
Brother.

536
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,340
Brother.

537
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,340
Brother.

538
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,840
Brother.

539
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,340
Brother.

540
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,340
Brother.

541
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,340
Brother.

542
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,340
Brother.

543
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,340
I don't want to owe you.

544
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,840
Brother.

545
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,340
I am not.

546
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,340
I owe you.

547
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,340
Brother.

548
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,840
Brother.

549
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,340
Wan Wu.

550
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,340
Where am I?

551
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,340
Where are you?

552
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,340
Am I alive?

553
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,340
I miss you so much.

554
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,340
Who's going to kill him?

555
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,340
He's going to jump.

556
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,340
What are you doing?

557
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,340
What am I doing?

558
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,340
I saw you were unconscious. I wanted to vent my anger on you.

559
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,340
Thank you.

560
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,340
I'm fine now.

561
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,340
You don't think I'm going to do anything to you, do you?

562
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,340
You're thinking quite well.

563
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,340
Enough, enough. Stop talking.

564
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,340
Echun just woke up. Let him rest for a while.

565
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,340
How do you feel?

566
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,340
I'm fine.

567
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,340
What's going on with you under the water?

568
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,340
I'm trapped in the water.

569
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,340
I'm not in good physical condition.

570
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,340
I'm sorry to make you all worry.

571
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,340
Do you remember what you said?

572
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,340
What did I say?

573
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,340
You said something nonsense when you were unconscious.

574
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,340
I think I had a nightmare.

575
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,340
I don't remember that I had a nightmare.

576
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,340
Since Echun is awake,

577
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,340
let's get ready and go down the mountain.

578
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,340
Wait.

579
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,340
Wait.

580
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,340
This time,

581
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:32,340
I'm really sorry to you all.

582
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,340
I've got you all into trouble.

583
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,340
The cause of the incident

584
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,340
started with a letter

585
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,340
I received a few days ago.

586
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,340
I thought it was my mother's illness.

587
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,340
But I never thought that

588
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,340
the letter was still with the danger letter of the Ghost Gang.

589
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,340
According to the letter,

590
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,340
my motherland was in civil war.

591
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,340
The Ghost Gangs colluded with the Ghost Gangs

592
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,340
and controlled my family.

593
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:08,340
They ordered me to steal the map of Donglu City.

594
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,340
Otherwise, my family would be killed.

595
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:15,340
They even printed my mother's blood on the letter.

596
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,340
I had no choice but to save them.

597
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,340
I could only follow their orders.

598
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,340
Brother Tao, I'm sorry.

599
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,340
I used the ghost-dreamer's brother

600
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,340
to go to the front to defend yourself.

601
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,340
I attracted your attention.

602
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,340
Then I came to the stable.

603
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,340
According to the Ghost Gangs,

604
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,340
I let go of all the horse-drawn horses.

605
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,340
I pretended to have stolen the horse.

606
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,340
I let you go to find the horse.

607
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,340
Go.

608
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,340
I transferred you away from the Crown Prince's camp.

609
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,340
Then I sent a letter to the Ghost Gangs.

610
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,340
I was afraid that if I was late,

611
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,340
they would kill my parents.

612
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,340
Then I secretly put the famous medicine in the water bowl.

613
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:15,340
The guards were not worried about me.

614
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,340
After drinking the water I sent,

615
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:22,340
they all fainted very quickly.

616
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,340
I took the key to the guard

617
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,340
and sneaked into the guest room.

618
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,340
I'm sorry.

619
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,340
But I know that

620
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:48,340
the city defense map is very important to Donglu City.

621
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,340
If Donglu City is broken,

622
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,340
it will be dangerous.

623
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,340
So I combined the new fake chest's

624
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,340
co-op gambling

625
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,340
and drew a fake map

626
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,340
to give to the people of the Ghost Gangs.

627
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,340
I know I made a big mistake.

628
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,340
I don't want to get everyone's forgiveness.

629
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,340
Just give me a chance

630
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,340
to return to my country.

631
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,340
I'm so sorry.

632
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,340
Gu Xiao.

633
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,340
Thank you for helping me

634
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,340
to return to my country.

635
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,340
I can't let you go.

636
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,340
If I let you go,

637
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,340
we will all

638
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,340
be punished the same way.

639
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,340
I lied to everyone.

640
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,340
But I never betray the heart of the Eagle Division.

641
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,340
Then you should go back to the camp with us

642
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,340
like a man

643
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,340
and take the punishment.

644
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,340
I...

645
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,340
Wait.

646
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,340
Jiang Wenhuan.

647
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,340
Don't forget.

648
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,340
The Ghost Gang's elite soldiers

649
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,340
are at the border of Donglu City.

650
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,340
They are waiting for the time.

651
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,340
Do you want to wait for them?

652
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,340
This is the first position of Daijiu Brigade.

653
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,340
Take down the lookout tower here.

654
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,340
It's like taking the eyes of the Donglu soldiers.

655
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:57,340
You can enter the city in a day.

656
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,340
Take down Donglu.

657
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,340
Put down the signal.

658
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,340
Yes.

659
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,340
Oh, no.

660
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,340
This is the signal from the Ghost Gang.

661
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,340
They are going to attack the city.

662
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,340
The Ghost Gang's elite soldiers are at the border of Donglu City.

663
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,340
Take down the lookout tower here.

664
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,340
