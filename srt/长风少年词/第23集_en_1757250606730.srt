1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Even if we are separated, we will never stop loving each other.

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,600
We will never give up on our hearts.

3
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,400
We will only fight for the end in our hearts.

4
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,000
Until our fates are finally revealed, we will never stop.

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Episode 15

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The King of Zhao, Kun Su, and his family are loyal to the country.

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
They have suffered for years.

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
They are worried that their blood will be stained.

9
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
They are worried that their blood will be stained.

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Today, the Zhuo Ling family is hereby named

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Fu Ming Yu, and the title is

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
General Feng Gu, Kun Ze, and General Zhong Lie.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The Holy Lady, Su Ying, and the Emperor,

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
are all hereby named.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The Holy Lady, Su Ying, and the Emperor,

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
are all hereby named.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The Holy Lady, Su Ying, and the Emperor,

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
is hereby named.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What are you going to do next?

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This matter is getting more complicated.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's hard to protect Qing Qing in the village.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's right.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Why don't we send her and the people of the You Su clan

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
to leave the village first?

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Once things settle down, we'll bring them back.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The people of the You Su clan are only women.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
How about this?

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'll go get some men to protect them.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Thank you.

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
They have already started packing.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The You Su clan are in a different place because of their birth father.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The story is about the fate of generations.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I just hope that we can stay away from the right and wrong

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and get rid of the curse of fate

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and live a free and ordinary life.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That little crybaby of yours

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
has finally grown up.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You've grown up too.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We're both brothers and sisters.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But, Brother,

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
are you really determined to keep the Crown Prince?

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
They are very affectionate to me.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
At the very least, I have to escort them back to the East Road safely

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and make other plans.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The Crown Prince ordered to find the longevity elixir.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But now he has found out that it's a source of evil.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I don't know how they will respond.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I want to stay and help them solve this matter.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Brother Zuo can't personally send you off.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What are you saying?

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
My brother is a person of great affection.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Of course, Qingqing understands.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But if you really want to stay,

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
you still need to pay more attention.

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What do you mean?

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
There are many secrets about the Sui clan.

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I have some guesses in my heart.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What do you think?

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Before Mother passed away, she said

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
that the punishment will come soon

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and the Saintess will be the beauty.

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This Saintess will be the beauty

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and the Holy Blood.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But the girl who was killed by the Sui clan

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
is a member of the Sui clan,

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
but she is not the Holy Blood.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So what I'm going to say is my guess.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I think the Guifang people have been making the Holy Blood for many years.

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
They have been waiting for a special skin.

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That is the skin of the Holy Blood.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Mother was so confused that year

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
that she didn't want her father to burn me.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It was all to destroy my

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
skin with the Holy Blood.

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
If it's really like what Granny Su said,

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
except me,

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Granny Su is the last Holy Blood.

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You mean

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Granny Su replaced you?

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Seven years.

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I finally made the Holy Blood.

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Now we are one step closer to our goal.

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Master, the Holy Blood has been made.

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Can it really control thousands of soldiers

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
with great magical power?

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You don't believe me.

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I don't believe you.

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I have been cooperating with you for many years.

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You still have something to keep me.

93
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
How can I continue to serve you?

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
After all,

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
you are afraid that I will be too careless.

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Forget it.

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
When I use this thing to fight against the Guoduo,

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I will be the one who will be the one to die.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I will be the one to die.

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
When I use this thing to fight against the Guoduo,

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I will tell you

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
how much it can help me.

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Before that,

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I need to borrow the Holy Bone.

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You want to fight against the Crown Prince?

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
With the Crown Prince here,

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
our plan will be hard to implement.

108
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Fine.

109
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
don't be too biased.

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Don't be too biased.

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Since the Holy Bone has such magical power,

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
how can I make sure

114
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
that I won't be affected by the Gu Yin

115
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
when I use it?

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
If you apply this,

117
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
you can keep your mind clear for a while.

118
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I won't say goodbye.

119
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
We will.

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Do you think

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
all of this

122
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
is really over?

123
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You and I both know

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
that this may just be the beginning.

125
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So,

126
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
what else is there

127
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
in Zhongli Palace

128
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
that is unreliable?

129
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Behind them,

130
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
there are some powerful Zhongli soldiers

131
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
who are helping us.

132
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The Heavenly God is born to be a subject.

133
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yin and Yang are not related.

134
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The little ones are in power.

135
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Everything is in chaos.

136
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What does this mean?

137
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's about to change.

138
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Where did the real person

139
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
come from?

140
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Why is he here alone?

141
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Change?

142
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What do you mean?

143
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The rain comes out of the water.

144
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The fire is low.

145
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It seems to be going to rain.

146
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Why did you come here today?

147
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm here to check the situation.

148
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
This is the Zhan's stage.

149
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I came to check the situation.

150
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Check what?

151
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Check the state's fortune.

152
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Donglu?

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Zhongli.

154
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What does Zhongli's state fortune have to do with you?

155
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Since the real person can know the destiny,

156
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
have you ever calculated

157
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
who will be the one

158
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
to destroy this Zhongli?

159
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Shut up.

160
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What do you want to say?

161
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The ancient god of the Youzu Clan.

162
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Don't you think it's strange?

163
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
All the way here,

164
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I've been talking about the whole Zhongli.

165
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The person I don't understand the most

166
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
is probably only you.

167
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You hurt me, you're brave.

168
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You helped me, you're brave.

169
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
When you were in danger, you saved me.

170
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You're brave.

171
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But I believe

172
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
you're not bad.

173
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Why?

174
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Because you never avoid my eyes.

175
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But Zhongli Yuan is different.

176
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
His eyes look innocent,

177
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
but he's always unpredictable.

178
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
He's different.

179
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So I came to you

180
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
because I think you should be like me.

181
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I want to know what's behind your eyes.

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
If you're okay,

183
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
why don't you listen to me

184
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
and give me some time?

185
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I have a talent.

186
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I can make people beautiful.

187
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm not good enough to see the past.

188
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I was bad enough a few years ago.

189
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The whole village

190
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
will be destroyed by an outsider.

191
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So I decided to

192
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
change my fate for my clan.

193
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Whoever came today,

194
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I won't let them in.

195
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Are you okay?

196
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Drink some water.

197
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You...

198
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
My parents

199
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
were killed by the bad guys.

200
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
My family died

201
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
because of me.

202
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm sorry.

203
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm sorry.

204
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm sorry.

205
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm sorry.

206
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm sorry.

207
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm sorry.

208
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm sorry.

209
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
My family tried so hard

210
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
to send me out of the city.

211
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But I got lost in the mountains.

212
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Miss,

213
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
is there a village

214
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
where I can rest?

215
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Yes.

216
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Over there.

217
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Are you sure?

218
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Just go ahead.

219
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Thank you.

220
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's okay.

221
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Anyway,

222
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
he won't live long.

223
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Come and get some water, Brother Yuan.

224
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Mother.

225
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You're back.

226
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm here.

227
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm here.

228
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm here.

229
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm here.

230
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Mother.

231
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You're back.

232
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Let me help you.

233
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Okay.

234
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
What are you laughing at?

235
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Mother, I'm grown up.

236
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I can protect you now.

237
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What a silly boy.

238
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Mother, come and help me.

239
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
What's going on?

240
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I went to pick up rabbits.

241
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I saw a child there.

242
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I thought I shot him.

243
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
He must be starving.

244
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Where is he?

245
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Oh, no.

246
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I can't let him stay in the village.

247
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Are you telling the truth?

248
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yan,

249
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
he really can't stay in the village.

250
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Otherwise, the whole village...

251
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Your prediction is not all-round.

252
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
If there's a mistake,

253
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
we'll die.

254
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
But, Yan,

255
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
it's too risky.

256
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
We can't save him.

257
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
No.

258
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
To protect yourself,

259
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
you must be a good person.

260
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You're talented.

261
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You must be more careful.

262
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Although fate is not good,

263
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
we must know what's right and wrong.

264
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
We must be good and evil.

265
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
We must be brave.

266
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
We must be brave.

267
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Hand him over.

268
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Please.

269
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Go.

270
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Hurry.

271
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yan.

272
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Go.

273
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Let me go.

274
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Let me go.

275
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Zhao Gu,

276
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
run.

277
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I don't have it.

278
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I don't have it.

279
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Keep searching.

280
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Yan.

281
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yan.

282
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yan.

283
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Mother.

284
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Mother.

285
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yan.

286
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yan.

287
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Get out.

288
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You did this.

289
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You killed everyone.

290
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You killed my father and mother.

291
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
How can you still be here?

292
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Get out.

293
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You can kill me.

294
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Come.

295
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Look at this.

296
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'll give you a good beating.

297
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'll give you a good beating.

298
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You're like a child.

299
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You're like a child.

300
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You're dead.

301
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I, Yan and Yang,

302
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
can come back?

303
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I should have killed you long ago.

304
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I should have killed you

305
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,200
I'll kill you!

306
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,440
No.

307
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:44,840
No.

308
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,040
Ayi.

309
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,800
Ayi.

310
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,160
Ayi, you're wrong.

311
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,720
Fate

312
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,880
can't change.

313
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,440
What's destined

314
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,840
can't change.

315
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,360
Kill me.

316
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,440
Kill me.

317
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,720
This way,

318
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,800
I can be with my parents.

319
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,600
Okay.

320
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,420
You know what

321
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,280
All the way

322
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,960
from Guodu to Zhongli,

323
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,600
they put me

324
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,160
and my parents' bodies

325
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,600
in a single carriage.

326
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,240
Everyday I

327
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,960
cried and 중空

328
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:15,880
and laced up

329
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,480
in their body.

330
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,680
I cried.

331
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,760
I precariously

332
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,400
interesting

333
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I was thinking the same as you.

334
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It would be great if I also died together.

335
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
As long as I die, our family will be reunited.

336
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
But do you know

337
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
how long it will take from Guodu to Zhongli?

338
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
One month.

339
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Have you smelled the scent of the blood?

340
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Do you remember the process of the body being taken away?

341
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
At first,

342
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I felt very relieved

343
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
only when I was lying in the middle of them.

344
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
But later,

345
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I didn't dare to stay with them for a moment.

346
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I cried and begged for mercy.

347
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I said, let me out. I'm begging you.

348
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm begging you.

349
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
They are my parents.

350
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Since then,

351
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I've realized how much I want to live.

352
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
That person won't let me go.

353
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I must go back.

354
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You can kill me if you want.

355
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
If you can't kill me,

356
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
then go back with me.

357
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I promise you.

358
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
In ten years, kill my parents

359
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
and the people of your family.

360
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I will kill them all.

361
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I promise you.

362
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I will die in our hands.

363
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
If I have to,

364
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
you can kill me.

365
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
This is my promise to you.

366
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
This is what I owe you.

367
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
From that day onwards,

368
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I will marry her

369
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
and the whole Zhe Mansion

370
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,800
to rebuild Zhongli.

371
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,520
He returned to Zhongli to be a subordinate

372
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,200
and let the state prefect release the wind and alert the enemy.

373
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,320
I was caught into the war station

374
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,760
with my own skills

375
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,160
and followed the state prefect.

376
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,160
We were both in the dark

377
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,200
and supported each other

378
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,680
and struggled to move forward.

379
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,120
It's because we both believe

380
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,480
that one day we can avenge

381
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,240
Zhongli

382
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,720
and return to the peaceful and prosperous state.

383
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,320
If you say so,

384
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,360
then Zhongli Yuan is behind all your actions.

385
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,880
Strictly speaking,

386
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,200
we planned it together.

387
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,480
It seems that

388
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,400
he is a very determined person.

389
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,560
You are so wise.

390
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,400
Zhongli Yuan is so thoughtful.

391
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,480
Does the real person

392
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,480
never have a doubt?

393
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,280
He is the only person I have trusted in these years.

394
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,640
He is also the Heavenly Lord

395
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,320
who can bring the peaceful and prosperous state back to Zhongli.

396
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,120
Heavenly Lord?

397
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,600
It's the Heavenly Lord again.

398
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,120
Can the real person

399
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,880
say something new?

400
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:08,880
You...

401
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:11,960
Okay.

402
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,680
I have something to do.

403
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,160
I'll leave first.

404
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,480
Do you believe him?

405
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,480
I don't believe him.

406
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,560
But I believe you.

407
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,120
Master.

408
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,760
I have something to discuss with you.

409
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,120
Okay.

410
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,480
If it's really as you said,

411
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,080
it's not easy to do it.

412
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:07,960
Can you

413
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,240
write down the record of Dongzhong Bihua

414
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,360
on the letter of the late emperor?

415
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,880
I'll do it.

416
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:12,920
I'll do it.

417
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,560
I'll do it.

418
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,200
I'll do it.

419
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:14,800
I'll do it.

420
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,440
I'll do it.

421
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,040
I'll do it.

422
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,640
I'll do it.

423
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,280
I'll do it.

424
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:17,920
I'll do it.

425
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,760
Tell His Majesty

426
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,600
about the record of the Immortal Medicine

427
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,360
and make him stop seeking for it.

428
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,520
It's not as simple as you think.

429
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,800
The legend of the Immortal Medicine

430
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,800
has been passed down for generations.

431
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,640
It's the honor of the Shangshan Royal Family.

432
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,920
The previous kings

433
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,680
have worked hard to find the medicine but failed.

434
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,880
Now,

435
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,440
our King

436
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,960
is at a loss

437
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,440
to find the Immortal Medicine.

438
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,240
Several years ago,

439
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,960
because the medicine failed,

440
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,160
the whole of Ningzhou

441
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,760
was enraged by the emperor.

442
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,280
Now, you have to tell him

443
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,560
that the Immortal Medicine is a poison.

444
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,000
The Long-Living Dream is a game of chance.

445
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,840
It's not just Zhongli who is involved.

446
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,200
Then,

447
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,200
how will he treat the Prince

448
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,240
and the Eastland?

449
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,640
Find the Immortal Medicine

450
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,320
and bring the evidence back to the capital.

451
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,640
It will completely break His Majesty's wish.

452
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,200
But now, we have to find Zhongli

453
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,560
before we can find the evidence.

454
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,720
Besides,

455
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,160
the changes between seven years ago and Zhongli

456
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,880
are all confused.

457
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,800
I always feel that

458
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,080
the mastermind behind this

459
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,320
is not just Xian Xuanji.

460
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,800
Are you suspecting

461
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,800
that the Gui Fang people of Su Village

462
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,680
are related to Zhong Liyuan?

463
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,880
Zhong Liyuan has been

464
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,280
very strong for so many years.

465
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,040
He can't

466
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,800
compete with the State Preceptor

467
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,720
with his own strength.

468
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,200
But the Gui Fang people

469
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,600
have been living in Su Village for years.

470
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,440
But no one knows.

471
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,680
It's really suspicious.

472
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,120
I always feel that

473
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,080
the real Zhong Liyuan

474
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,720
is not that simple.

475
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,640
Lord Gongsun,

476
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,520
Jiang Xiao,

477
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,320
the Zhongli Palace sent a message.

478
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,680
The Zhongli State Preceptor

479
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,600
invited us in person three days later

480
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,400
to make a speech.

481
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,080
I'm Officer testifying,

482
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,680
so I will have no reason to serve such a delivery call.

483
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,800
Will you go there this way?

484
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,520
Of course I will.

485
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,680
This.

486
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,920
потер Tianli Jiu Теперь

487
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,120
I'll overlap it in front of Your Highness.

488
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,360
I'm just closer to Your Majesty

489
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,480
than I was before.

490
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,960
Tianli Jiu 내려 filmed

491
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,160
I never need these

492
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,320
Then what do you like

493
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,360
Tell me what you want

494
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,200
I will let them get them for you

495
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,960
Now our great cause has been achieved

496
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,560
Zhongli is mine and yours

497
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,040
No matter what you want

498
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,640
As long as you tell me

499
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,840
I will get it for you

500
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,080
What do I want

501
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,160
Do you still remember him

502
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,880
Do you still remember him

503
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,200
Do you remember what you said

504
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,880
when you gave it to me

505
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,400
Of course I remember

506
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,360
Now Xuan Xuanji is dead

507
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,120
When the Crown Prince goes back to report

508
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,880
His Majesty will definitely investigate this

509
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,280
What's your next plan

510
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,760
I want you to let me go

511
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,240
You professor

512
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,960
You want to kill sólo

513
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,560
Do you want to kill yourself

514
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,000
What are you talking about

515
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,800
So little

516
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,960
Now when the Princess is seeded

517
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,040
Our点子

518
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,040
But from now on,

519
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,040
you don't need to care about these things.

520
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,040
You can stay at Zhan Shitai to study the stars.

521
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:21,040
You can go out to see the Ming Mountain and Dachuan.

522
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:25,040
But I'm here for whatever you do.

523
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,040
I don't need your company.

524
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,040
I just hope that you can be a good master

525
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,040
and protect the people of Zhongli.

526
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,040
Okay, I'll listen to you.

527
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,040
I'll go.

528
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,040
Gu Xi,

529
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,040
I've been wanting to ask you.

530
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:15,040
Are you willing to be my...

531
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,040
What are you doing?

532
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,040
You said it.

533
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:34,040
You said you would never use that power on me.

534
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,040
You can ask me whatever you want to know.

535
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,040
Will I not tell you?

536
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,040
Okay, I'll ask you.

537
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:54,040
Is it related to you that the people of the Su family are in the valley?

538
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,040
Gu Xi,

539
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,040
you and I have been together for so many years.

540
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,040
Don't you trust me anymore?

541
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,040
You said it.

542
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,040
If I have any questions, I can ask you.

543
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,040
I'll ask you again.

544
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:13,040
Is it related to you that the people of the Su family are in the valley?

545
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,040
Gu Xi,

546
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,040
you're the only person in this world who cares about the new people.

547
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:33,040
You should know that no matter what happens,

548
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,040
I will never harm you.

549
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,040
Keep it well.

550
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,040
No one is allowed to enter.

551
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,040
Yes.

552
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,040
Gu Xi,

553
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:36,040
you're the only person in this world who cares about the new people.

554
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,040
You should know that no one is allowed to enter.

555
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,040
You should know that no one is allowed to enter.

556
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,040
You should know that no one is allowed to enter.

557
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,040
You should know that no one is allowed to enter.

558
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,040
You should know that no one is allowed to enter.

559
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,040
You should know that no one is allowed to enter.

560
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,040
You should know that no one is allowed to enter.

561
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,040
You're looking for me?

562
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,040
You brought me here on purpose.

563
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,040
I hope that

564
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,040
you won't come today.

565
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,040
Wait a little longer.

566
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,040
After I've finished the Crown Prince Camp,

567
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,040
