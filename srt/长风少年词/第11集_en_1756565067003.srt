1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The sword and the sword are too strong, love and dreams are eternal

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,600
No matter how many times we meet in the world

3
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,400
Only for the end in our hearts

4
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,000
Until the dawn breaks, never stop

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The End

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Episode 14

7
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,000
Zhong Yi Biao didn't do it.

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What?

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,800
He didn't do it?

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yes

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Zhong Yi Wu is useless

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yesterday, the crown prince was frightened in the Eastern Wu's mansion

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This is the tranquilizing soup prepared by the general

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
to calm the nerves

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Thank you for your kindness

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Do you have to send it to him in person?

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's okay

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'll go and check

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The crown princess is actually working for us

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Keep your voice down

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The crown princess is really not simple

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yesterday at the banquet, the two brothers almost fought for her

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Then the second prince is so scary

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I thought he really wanted to be a brother

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Let's go

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The crown princess is here

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The crown princess

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Kill someone

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The crown princess is here

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Kill someone

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What is this?

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What is this?

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What is this?

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What is this?

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What is this?

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What is this?

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What is this?

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What is this?

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
General, Lord Gongsun

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I have checked

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The fatal wound on the chest

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The upper body is shallow and the outer body is bent

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But it matches the shape of the brave man

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I didn't kill him

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But it's okay to die

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I don't have to kill him myself

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
How dare you

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
At this time

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You still dare to argue

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Chong Yibiao killed his own family

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's really a bad thing that I've never heard of

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Please ask the general and Lord Gongsun

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
to immediately punish this biggest villain

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Please ask the general and Lord Gongsun

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
to immediately punish him

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
to appease the anger of the world

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
To appease the anger of the world

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Lord Gongsun

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You are representing the world

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Lord Gongsun

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What do you mean?

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The evidence is clear

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Does Dongluo want to cover up the criminal?

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yes

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The evidence is clear

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Lord Gongsun

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Who saw Chong Yibiao kill people with a sword?

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The evidence is clear

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Is the evidence a witness or a witness?

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The brave man's blade is the evidence

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The brave man's blade is unique

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But the blade marks of the brave man

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
may not be the same

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
How do you explain

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
that Chong Yibiao was there at the time of the crime?

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yes

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
How do you explain?

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Except Chong Yibiao

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You were also in the house of the Marquis of Dongwu

81
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
If so

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Then everyone in the Marquis's house has a good reputation

83
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You are too much

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You are too much

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Lord Gongsun

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You are so good at talking

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Chong Yibiao was as fierce as a fruit

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We are all witnesses

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Except Chong Yibiao

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Who else can it be?

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Who else can it be?

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Except for Chong Yibiao

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I think you are more confused

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You saw the Princess Consort yesterday

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and was caught by Chong Yibiao

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Am I right?

102
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You have been looking at Chong Yibiao

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and you have been looking at him

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Right?

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Lord Gongsun

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You two

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Who said yesterday

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
that Chong Yibiao was not talented

110
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
and had no virtue

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and that Marquis of North Marquis

112
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
adored him so much?

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
How can it be?

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What did you say?

115
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You said you were blind

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's you

117
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Lord Gongsun

118
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's you

119
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You are all here

120
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's all a matter of time

121
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's not your turn

122
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
to be here

123
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
and stand here and talk

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You know

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
that there is not enough evidence

126
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and it is not enough to make a conclusion

127
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Right?

128
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
If so

129
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Marquis of East Wuhou

130
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
can't be convicted easily

131
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
and wronged Marquis

132
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
If not

133
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
then you will see

134
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Marquis of North Marquis

135
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and the King

136
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and there is no way to explain

137
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But don't worry

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What happened in East Wuhou

139
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
is a provocation

140
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Marquis of East Wuhou

141
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
will not be alone

142
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and will investigate it thoroughly

143
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Jiang Wenhuan

144
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I am here

145
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You are in charge of investigating this case

146
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Before the high-message

147
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
we must find out the real murderer

148
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I will follow your order

149
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I will find out the truth

150
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
and clear you of the charges

151
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Then I will trouble you

152
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
to stay in the mansion for a few days

153
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
to help me investigate

154
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
As for Chong Yibiao

155
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
take him to the dungeon of the mansion

156
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
and wait for the news

157
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Guards

158
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I have completed

159
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
what you ordered

160
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Can you fulfill

161
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
the wish of the Crown Prince

162
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
as you promised?

163
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I don't have the chance

164
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I am not a good man

165
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I hope you can help me

166
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
to get the Crown Prince back

167
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I will do my best

168
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
to help you

169
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I will do my best

170
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
to help you

171
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I will do my best

172
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
to help you

173
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I will do my best

174
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I hope you can

175
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
forget the kindness of my father

176
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
and do your best

177
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Don't worry

178
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I will keep my promise

179
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
to the old Marquis

180
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Today, you are a little

181
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
ungrateful

182
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You don't agree

183
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
with my approach?

184
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I don't think so

185
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
This has nothing to do with Donglu

186
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You also think that

187
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
this is from Donglu?

188
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Not only Donglu

189
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It seems that

190
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
he is also from the Crown Prince Camp

191
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
We have thought of something

192
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Changsheng has to leave

193
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
and the Crown Prince Camp is set in Donglu

194
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Donglu will not be peaceful for a day

195
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's my fault

196
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I couldn't stop the Emperor

197
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
from asking

198
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Don't blame yourself

199
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The monster is the long-living immortal medicine

200
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I think

201
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
it's not an immortal medicine

202
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's like a monster from a disaster country

203
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Young Master

204
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Don't say that

205
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
If the Emperor knows

206
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Donglu is in trouble

207
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I understand

208
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Now

209
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It depends on what I can find

210
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
in the future

211
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Master

212
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Open the door

213
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Jue Lv

214
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Are you okay?

215
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Are you hurt?

216
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Did they torture you?

217
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Did they give you food?

218
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Let me see

219
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Torture and food?

220
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What did you think of me

221
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
as the Marquis of Donglu?

222
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Now that you are being framed

223
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
someone must have instigated you

224
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Who knows what other consequences

225
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
those two evil men have?

226
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You won't believe that

227
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I was framed

228
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Jue Lv

229
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Although you are annoying

230
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
you are so arrogant

231
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You don't even want to

232
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
make a comment

233
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
If you want to punish your brother

234
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
you have to win

235
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
a fair and fair battle

236
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Right?

237
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You can't do

238
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
such a thing

239
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Don't say that

240
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
as if you know me very well

241
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
When did you

242
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
become so stubborn?

243
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
We have drunk together

244
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and been punished

245
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
We are brothers

246
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You are busy

247
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
We can't help you

248
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I am not your brother

249
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I don't need your pity

250
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Look at you

251
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You are so stubborn

252
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You are still stubborn

253
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Why are you so distant

254
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
from the world?

255
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You know

256
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
that there are people

257
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
who really care about you

258
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Brother Chu

259
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's an important matter

260
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I will say it

261
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
without any hesitation

262
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You are ambitious

263
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and talented

264
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
If you ruin yourself

265
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
because of your brother

266
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
and you are charged with crime

267
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
it would be a pity

268
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Why do you help me?

269
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Well

270
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I know them

271
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I just want you to owe me

272
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I think you will

273
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
dare to

274
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
show your ugly face

275
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
in front of me

276
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
who saved you

277
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I

278
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
can't stand

279
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
these tricks

280
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What about you?

281
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
For the promise

282
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Brother Chu

283
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So what happened?

284
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Why did you

285
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
appear in Chong Yiwu's room?

286
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
How did Chong Yiwu die?

287
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I don't know

288
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
After I went back that day

289
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I was so worried

290
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I was practicing martial arts in the yard

291
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I suddenly received the news

292
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
that my father was seriously ill

293
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Chong Yiwu insisted on killing me

294
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
He said that I would never

295
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
be able to go back to Libei

296
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I was anxious at that time

297
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I ran to him

298
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
to find a theory

299
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
before I could let go

300
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Chong Yiwu

301
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I let you go

302
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
but you are more aggressive

303
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Get up

304
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The bandit

305
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
He killed someone

306
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Who sent

307
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
that letter?

308
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Do you know?

309
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I think

310
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
it was the real murderer

311
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
who wanted to lure me

312
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
to go there

313
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
and make me the scapegoat

314
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
He knew Brother Chong so well

315
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
He must have seen

316
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
the grudge between you and Chong Yiwu

317
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That's why he made such a plan

318
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's not easy

319
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Brother Chong

320
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Is there anything

321
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
that is difficult to make

322
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
about the cause of the brave?

323
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
There is one thing

324
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
that no one can prevent

325
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Brother, what's wrong?

326
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Did Brother Chong really say that?

327
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The brave

328
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
were killed by the bandit

329
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
They were extremely cold

330
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
The wounds caused by them

331
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
were cut off by the blood

332
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
and the blood was frozen

333
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
There was very little blood left

334
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The blood was frozen

335
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
and the wound was cut off

336
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The wound was cut off

337
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The wound was cut off

338
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The wound was cut off

339
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The wound was cut off

340
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The wound was cut off

341
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But a few hours later

342
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
the wound was frozen

343
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
and the blood was blotchy

344
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
and the blood was violent

345
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Chong Yiwu's wounds

346
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
were clean and sharp

347
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
and the blood was cut off

348
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
There was no one

349
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
who caused the blood to be violent

350
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
That means

351
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
someone imitated the brave

352
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
That's right

353
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
This person was able to

354
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
create such a powerful weapon

355
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
in such a short time

356
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It must be someone

357
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
who is quite familiar with Eastland

358
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Brother Jiang

359
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Where are you going?

360
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Since I'm familiar with Eastland

361
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'll see if someone

362
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
is willing to help me

363
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Brother Jiang

364
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
We're not going to the Eastland

365
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Brother Jiang

366
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Who are we waiting for?

367
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Waiting for someone

368
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Someone can help us

369
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
investigate this matter

370
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Because in Eastland

371
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
there is a place

372
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
where the brave can be created

373
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm afraid

374
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
there is only the Prime Minister of Qian Kun

375
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Look, someone is coming

376
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What? Jiang Wenhua

377
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You also have a day

378
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
to beg me?

379
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Please, Miss

380
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Thank you

381
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The best weapon shop in Qian Kun

382
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
is this one

383
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
There is no branch

384
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Miss, why are you here?

385
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
These people are

386
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Don't be nervous

387
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
They are all my friends

388
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I have a question to ask you

389
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Since they are all

390
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Miss's friends

391
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I will definitely tell them everything

392
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You are very good at it

393
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
The guests who come here

394
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
must be rich and rich

395
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Of course

396
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
The nobles are hard to serve

397
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
They are very strict

398
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
with the requirements of weapons

399
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I think

400
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
you have a time

401
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
to be ungrateful

402
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm not bragging

403
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
As long as the guests

404
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
make the requirements

405
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I can't make

406
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
any weapons

407
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
This thing

408
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Has anyone

409
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
made it recently?

410
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
This

411
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
No

412
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I have never seen this

413
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I have never seen it

414
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You don't even blink

415
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I have

416
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
countless weapons in my life

417
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I have never seen it

418
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I have never seen it

419
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I have countless weapons

420
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I have never seen it

421
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I have never made it

422
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I will know it in a glance

423
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
This is important

424
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
If there is a mistake

425
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It may involve the Prime Minister

426
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Are you sure you have never seen it?

427
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Miss, don't worry

428
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I saved my life

429
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
from Mr. Li

430
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I swear in the name

431
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
of my fourth brother

432
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I will never do

433
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
anything that will hurt the Prime Minister

434
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Let's go

435
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Thank you

436
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Take care

437
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Go

438
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Give this

439
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
to that person

440
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
This

441
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Go

442
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Go

443
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The Ghost Handbook

444
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
has a lot of names and letters

445
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Since it is named

446
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It will never lie

447
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Even if you

448
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
stay here for a day

449
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You will get nothing

450
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Don't say too much

451
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
What do you mean?

452
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You mean

453
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
our people from the Qian Kun

454
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
are colluding with the scoundrel?

455
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
A-Se

456
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
The shop owner

457
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
is so respectful to you

458
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But he is so

459
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
ungrateful to you

460
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
He is being selfish

461
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Besides

462
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
That man

463
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
That man

464
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
is not as heavy as him

465
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
He was shaken by the picture

466
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
But

467
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Why did the ghost handbook lie?

468
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Only he knows

469
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Where is Xin Jia?

470
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Brother Jiang

471
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
This is a good map

472
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Hurry up

473
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Go

474
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Brother

475
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Where are you going?

476
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I

477
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I don't know anything

478
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Youzhuo, just kill me

479
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I don't know anything

480
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Kill me

481
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Who said I would kill you?

482
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
This is the Qian Kun alley

483
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You tied me up

484
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
None of you can escape

485
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Really?

486
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
If you tell me the truth

487
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I will let you go

488
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Have you seen

489
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
that knife?

490
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I can find it out

491
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
even if you don't tell me

492
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
But it will be bad luck

493
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
not only for you

494
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
The ghost handbook

495
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
will also be expelled from Qian Kun alley

496
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You'd better think it over

497
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Think it over?

498
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
A few days ago

499
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Someone brought a strange map

500
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
to make a knife

501
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Tell me

502
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Who is that man's surname

503
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
What is his figure

504
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
What is his face

505
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
That man

506
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
covered his face with a crazy hat

507
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
His left foot seems to be injured

508
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It's a cripple

509
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Your master asked you

510
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
to give that man a letter

511
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's a trap

512
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
What trap?

513
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
He is gone

514
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
That's great

515
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
He let his men

516
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
lead us to report the news

517
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Is the ghost handbook

518
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
really related to the murderer?

519
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Brother Jiang

520
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
What if we lose the clue?

521
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's not like we all lost the clue

522
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
We can't be sure

523
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
We can't be sure

524
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Brother Jiang

525
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Brother Jiang

526
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
We can't be sure

527
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
The fireman said

528
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
that man was drunk

529
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I don't know

530
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
if he is telling the truth or not

531
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
We are the ones who said that

532
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It should be true

533
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Besides

534
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's not worth it

535
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
to tell such a lie

536
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
A cripple

537
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
can't kill Chong Yiwu

538
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
How many paths

539
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
do you have

540
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
There is only one

541
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's the waterway we came in

542
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
The murderer is alone

543
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
He should be in Qian Kun alley

544
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
How do you know

545
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
The waterway in Qian Kun alley

546
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
is not a common way

547
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
The owner is half a year old

548
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
He has no energy

549
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Usually when he goes to Qian Kun alley

550
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
he is afraid that

551
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
the fireman will come out

552
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's true

553
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
If so

554
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
If the murderer is still

555
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
in Qian Kun alley

556
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
The owner will use himself

557
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
as a bait

558
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
and let the fireman send the letter

559
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But he chose

560
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
to send the letter himself

561
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
This shows two things

562
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
One

563
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
The place where the murderer is

564
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
is in Qian Kun alley

565
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Two

566
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
He must send the letter himself

567
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Who can let the ghost handbook

568
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
take the risk

569
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
to send the letter himself

570
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
We should go back to the dungeon

571
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
A-Se

572
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I need you to help me

573
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
to check the inside of Qian Kun alley

574
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Is there anyone suspicious

575
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
in Qian Kun alley

576
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Okay

577
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Let's go

578
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
There are so many people

579
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
in Qian Kun alley

580
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm so tired

581
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
to ask them

582
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm going to be caught

583
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
and beaten up again

584
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
The man is wearing a wind-shaped coat

585
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
and covered his face

586
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
But

587
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
his left foot seems to be injured

588
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's a cripple

589
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Qi

590
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
The place where the murderer is

591
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
is in Qian Kun alley

592
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Qi

593
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
He must send the letter himself

594
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Who can let the ghost handbook

595
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
take the risk

596
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
to send the letter himself

597
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Si

598
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Why are you back so late

599
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Where have you been

600
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Why don't you talk

601
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You are alive

602
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Dad

603
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Has anyone

604
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
in the mansion

605
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
been missing recently

606
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yes

607
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Yes

608
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Yes

609
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
The manager of the backyard

610
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
fell down a few days ago

611
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
What happened

612
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Manager

613
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I've checked it

614
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
according to the doctor

615
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Although he is still

616
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
walking around

617
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
he is fine

618
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
That's good

619
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Si

620
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It's late

621
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It's cold outside

622
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Go back to the room

623
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Hello, Miss

624
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
The footprints here

625
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
are left-footed

626
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
The manager is right-footed

627
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Why did Dad lie to me

628
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Come out

629
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
You came here late at night

630
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Did something happen

631
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
The son of the Marquis of North China has died

632
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
He is deeply involved

633
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Jiang Wenhuan and Eashun

634
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
have also begun to investigate this matter

635
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Young Master

636
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I'm afraid you haven't

637
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
aroused the hatred between

638
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Libei and Eastland

639
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Neither of us can hold on

640
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You are thinking too much

641
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Since I dare to do so

642
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I'm not afraid of him

643
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
to change the subject

644
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
What do you want to do again

645
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You said

646
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
if this murderer

647
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
committed suicide for the crime

648
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
is it

649
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
that there is no evidence

650
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
At that time

651
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
the Marquis of North China will lose two sons

652
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I see how he will explain

653
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
to the Marquis of Eastland

654
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I'm afraid

655
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
that the murderer

656
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
who killed your husband

657
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
is not the one

658
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
who was killed by Young Master

659
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
He is not that kind of person

660
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
How do you know

661
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I

662
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I

663
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I

664
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I

665
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I

666
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I

667
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I

668
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I

669
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I

670
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I

671
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I

672
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I

673
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I know

674
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I believe him

675
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
no matter what

676
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Don't forget your identity

677
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Don't forget your identity

678
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
He said

679
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
he didn't know

680
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
that the one in prison

681
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
is his husband

682
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Do you want to go in

683
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
This is the milk wine

684
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
and the lamb on the grassland

685
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Please give it to him

686
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Today is his birthday

687
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I don't know

688
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Let's go

689
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
We don't have much time

690
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Open the door

691
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
That's the thing

692
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
The clue was broken when we arrived at the weapon shop

693
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
We are already looking for

694
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
the person who made the fake knife

695
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Juli

696
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Do you know

697
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Quanzi

698
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
No

699
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Brother Chong

700
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Do you remember

701
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
what happened that day

702
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
when you were in prison

703
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I don't know

704
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Do you remember

705
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
what you missed that day

706
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Pearl

707
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I seemed to see

708
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
a glowing

709
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
night pearl under the bedside

710
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I didn't have time to think about it

711
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Now I think about it

712
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Chong Yiwu hates night pearls the most

713
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
He thinks that thing is evil

714
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
How could it be hidden in the room

715
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Night Pearl

716
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Night Pearl

717
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
is not a common thing

718
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
It's valuable

719
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
in Donglu City

720
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I understand

721
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
The murderer

722
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
must not be an ordinary person

723
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's rare

724
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Brother Chong

725
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
You can stay here

726
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Leave the investigation to us

727
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Happy birthday

728
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
This is what the Princess Consort

729
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
asked us to send in

730
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
She said that today is your birthday

731
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Let's go

732
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Wait

733
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Drink with me

734
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I'm not drinking

735
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I'm not drinking

736
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I'm not drinking

737
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Young Master

738
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
News from Donglu City

739
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
News from Donglu City

740
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
News from Donglu City

741
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Trans..)

742
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
It is said that the Duke of Nanbo

743
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,640
wants to talk with the kitchen Fairy

744
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,880
Said the Duchess of BC Wishing

745
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
to wait for an Community

746
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,000
To investigate the truth

747
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,840
and then follow the Young Master 희

748
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,600
We would like to set loose Xichuan

749
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,160
Boshan

750
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Two정 twisted

751
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

752
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
You're worried that

753
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Marquis of Northern State is unfavorable to Second Childe Chong.

754
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
But Marquis of Northern State has only two sons.

755
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Now, one of them is already dead.

756
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Could it be that he still...

757
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
The two of them are willing to die.

758
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
There's no turning back.

759
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Brother Chong is still alive

760
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
because he still has the value of the family.

761
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Even if Chong Yi Wu is already dead,

762
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Marquis of Northern State, even if he supports Pang Zhi,

763
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
he will never let Brother Chong take the throne.

764
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Childe,

765
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
opening up the path is not a small matter.

766
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I've made a mistake.

767
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I shouldn't have questioned your decision.

768
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I'll just let someone else know.

769
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
You're not used to drinking this wine, are you?

770
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
It's been years since we last met.

771
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Your horse skills have improved.

772
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Your drinking capacity has also improved.

773
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I never thought that after so many years,

774
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
we would be drinking this wine again.

775
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
We've already lost our sense of smell and taste.

776
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I know that you're not human.

777
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
A human being's sense of smell and taste

778
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
is just like an old friend.

779
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Don't worry.

780
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
We will do our best to find out the truth.

781
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I'll be waiting for you.

782
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Childe, it's time to take your medicine.

783
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
This body of mine is full of the wounds

784
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
that Chong Yi Biao gave me.

785
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I must not speak.

786
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I didn't say anything wrong.

787
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Why would you complain about someone like him

788
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
and help him secretly?

789
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
We have an agreement.

790
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I look like this now.

791
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
But as long as he's still here,

792
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
our wish will come true.

793
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Have you never hated Childe Chong?

794
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Why?

795
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I've hated him.

796
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Brother Chong!

797
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Brother Chong, look.

798
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
He left this little tent.

799
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
The outside world

800
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
is big.

801
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Even if everyone in the world

802
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
is afraid of you,

803
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
you still can't lose

804
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
half of your grassland's

805
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
best soldiers.

806
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Because this

807
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
is what you've got yourself.

808
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
No one can change it,

809
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
including your brother-in-law.

810
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Today

811
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
is the day to drink Manai wine.

812
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I'll drink it.

813
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Happy birthday,

814
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
An Kang.

815
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Between you and me,

816
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
our hearts are boundless.

817
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
This wine

818
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
is our second meeting.

819
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I didn't expect

820
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
that you would be so kind

821
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
to be drunk

822
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
as the son of the Marquis of Nanbo.

823
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
You're a thief.

824
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Nonsense!

825
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I just want to

826
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
make friends with you.

827
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
The way you make friends

828
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
is really special.

829
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
The way you make friends

830
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
is really special.

831
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
The way you make friends

832
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
is really special.

833
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
The way you make friends

834
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
is really special.

835
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
The way you make friends

836
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
is really special.

837
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
The way you make friends

838
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
is really special.

839
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
The way you make friends

840
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
is really special.

841
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
The way you make friends

842
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
is really special.

843
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
The way you make friends

844
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
is really special.

845
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
The way you make friends

846
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
is really special.

847
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
The way you make friends

848
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
is really special.

849
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
The way you make friends

850
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
is really special.

851
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Dream becomes reality.

852
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Who knows what will happen in the past?

853
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:44,220
I was

854
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,820
Now

855
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,880
Go

856
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,700
Go

857
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,660
Don't bear me
