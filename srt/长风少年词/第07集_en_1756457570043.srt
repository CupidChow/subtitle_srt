1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,440
Bycs and by Wrights

2
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,000
Both friends have eternal これ都是偌 amusing

3
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,720
何乎在心与天地间 无负自信

4
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,120
只为了彼此彼地护 cloves 信心的團 只为现在可以翻炒

5
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:16,000
直到临云破晓 直到宝宝 直到直到永不停歇

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 16

7
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Ding, did you find it?

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
No, it's said that it's missing.

9
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Missing?

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes.

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The last time it appeared was in the slave market.

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I met the slave again.

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I heard that the slave was chasing after the slave.

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
After walking out of the alley, the slave disappeared.

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Later, the slave was looking for it for a long time.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But he didn't find it.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's so bright.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
How can it disappear in the sky?

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Disappear in the sky?

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Brother He, can I have a gift?

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's okay.

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Let's go to a place.

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Let's go back and clean up.

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You know me?

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I don't want to owe you.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Brother Jiang, I don't want to owe you.

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The time has come, so I give you your gift.

28
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,540
Brother Jiang topics me here for what?

29
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,000
What?

30
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,680
We went to the Southern Capital

31
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:44,560
but it wasn't compare to

32
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,960
the Eastern march by weight

33
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,920
These kids were also from a good family

34
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,320
They never stop

35
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,680
ất

36
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,080
The owner is kind and is full of food and clothing.

37
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,240
But some children

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,040
are not so lucky.

39
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,480
Maybe I don't know

40
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,320
some black-hearted slave-lovers

41
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,640
are all good-looking children.

42
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,240
They are raised to be a dozen years old

43
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,440
and sold to those who have special tastes.

44
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,840
They are abused and are not born well.

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,200
Some smart children

46
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,040
know the right and wrong

47
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,360
and see the situation is not good and run away.

48
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,800
But most of them

49
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,200
will be caught

50
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,760
and have a good meal.

51
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:26,840
Mr. Jiang,

52
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,280
you are here.

53
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,880
Look at these new slaves.

54
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,000
Do you have any favorite?

55
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,240
Let me see.

56
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,160
Kunwu,

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,800
I need you to remember one thing.

58
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,480
You have been practicing for many days

59
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,480
to imitate my voice

60
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,720
and behavior.

61
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,880
It's hard to distinguish between the slaves

62
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,360
and others.

63
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,560
If I take you there,

64
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,280
in case

65
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,200
you are exposed,

66
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,880
don't reveal your identity.

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,800
Otherwise,

68
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,440
we will be in trouble.

69
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,360
Brother Luo,

70
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,960
what's wrong?

71
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,440
You look so pale.

72
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,920
Are you feeling unwell?

73
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,480
I'm

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,720
very thin.

75
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,360
I can't bear to see this shape.

76
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,880
Selling snake cakes.

77
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,880
Selling snake cakes.

78
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,440
This is snake cake.

79
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,240
It will turn into a new color

80
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,280
after it is dried.

81
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,000
So, based on the color and smell,

82
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,840
we can find the way to escape.

83
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,040
How long has Mr. Li

84
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
been doing woodwork business with you in the South?

85
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,200
My brother said

86
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,360
Mr. Li and the South

87
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,440
have been doing woodwork business.

88
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,320
Do you know

89
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,480
one or two of them?

90
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,560
I'm the one in the house.

91
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,360
Most of the woodwork

92
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,280
is handled by my father and father-in-law.

93
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,560
I've been sick for a long time.

94
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,760
I'm not good at it.

95
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,800
I see.

96
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,760
By the way,

97
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,040
do you remember

98
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,200
the thing I told you before?

99
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
I picked up a slave

100
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,600
and ran away.

101
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,920
I saw him here.

102
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,560
I traveled around the place.

103
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,720
I want to see

104
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,800
if I have a chance

105
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,760
to have another chance with him.

106
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,480
You bastard!

107
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,240
How dare you hide?

108
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,040
Bastard!

109
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,960
I'll beat you to death!

110
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,160
I'll teach you how to hide.

111
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,960
If you keep hiding,

112
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,240
I'll beat you to death!

113
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,720
I'll beat you to death!

114
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
It hurts!

115
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,520
It hurts!

116
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,280
Let go of me!

117
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:14,960
It hurts!

118
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,240
It's you again.

119
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,400
Bastard!

120
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,080
Bastard!

121
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,640
Bastard!

122
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,280
Bastard!

123
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,000
You bastard!

124
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,920
You're so mean.

125
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,920
You can even

126
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,160
catch me.

127
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,000
Last time,

128
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,080
I saved that slave

129
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,080
from this bastard.

130
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,240
Last time,

131
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,000
I've taught him a lesson.

132
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,720
I didn't expect he

133
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,760
would still change his mind

134
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,120
and make a public mistake.

135
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,200
I know.

136
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,120
I know. Be gentle.

137
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:44,840
Tell me.

138
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,480
How should I punish him?

139
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,640
This is

140
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,320
the Crown Prince of the South Capital.

141
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,680
He's a guest of my noble family.

142
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,720
You've disturbed the guest.

143
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,880
Let the guest decide

144
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,840
how to punish him.

145
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,640
It's my fault.

146
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,800
Please forgive me.

147
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,040
I'll be more polite.

148
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,040
Please

149
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,000
please forgive me.

150
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,000
She

151
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,760
What's wrong?

152
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,480
Yourom WATCH.

153
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,720
Young Master Xiang,

154
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,200
she's their컴tat

155
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,440
since she looks like your daughter.

156
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,040
Looks like her?

157
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,560
Wei's Mansion

158
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,560
Have you ever been to the maidservant of the South Capital?

159
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,560
Yes, I have.

160
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,560
I often travel to the North.

161
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,560
You've been there?

162
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,560
I was there.

163
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,560
Have you ever seen him?

164
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,560
I remember.

165
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,560
I remember.

166
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,560
I saw you in South Capital.

167
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,560
Look at my memory.

168
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560
Thank you.

169
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,160
After looking closely,

170
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,960
I also think

171
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,160
you look familiar.

172
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,280
Mr. Jiang,

173
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,000
I have business to do.

174
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,200
Excuse me.

175
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:29,960
Excuse me.

176
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,480
Get up.

177
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,480
Get up.

178
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,560
Go.

179
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,320
Go.

180
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,360
Stop.

181
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,880
Miss, don't run.

182
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,680
Stop chasing.

183
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,520
Miss.

184
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,600
I'm not going to marry.

185
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,400
Stop.

186
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,960
Miss.

187
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:51,960
Get down.

188
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,360
Get down, Miss.

189
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,400
It's dangerous, Miss.

190
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,560
Stop chasing me.

191
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,240
Miss, get down.

192
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,840
It's dangerous.

193
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,520
Get down.

194
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,760
If you come any closer, I'll jump off.

195
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,720
Si, get down.

196
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,440
You still want to be ashamed?

197
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,400
It's embarrassing.

198
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,560
It's clear.

199
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,080
It's like it happened yesterday.

200
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,160
It seems that Miss Si

201
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,200
is forced to get married again.

202
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,520
You're so cruel.

203
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,360
You asked me to marry

204
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,600
an unknown person.

205
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,560
You don't even feel ashamed.

206
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,280
What am I afraid of?

207
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,240
I'm cruel?

208
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,240
I found you

209
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,680
from the Zanying family.

210
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,960
Yin family.

211
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,480
How can it be unknown?

212
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,040
You jump and you marry.

213
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,400
I jump and I marry.

214
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,920
You're a young girl with a good body.

215
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,880
What can you jump?

216
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,360
For your life,

217
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,320
I've offended you.

218
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,640
No one can be humiliated.

219
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,480
Come on.

220
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,200
Tie her up and take her back to the mansion.

221
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,240
How dare you?

222
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,960
You want me to marry now?

223
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,800
Okay.

224
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,760
I'll marry.

225
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,280
If you dare to marry me,

226
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,400
come out.

227
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,680
If you dare to marry me, come out.

228
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,440
Come on.

229
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,480
Why is it you?

230
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,480
Careful.

231
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,320
It does look like it.

232
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,920
Why are you here?

233
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,240
That.

234
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,760
We got the wrong place.

235
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,840
Hury up.

236
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,460
Goodbye.

237
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,800
Don't move.

238
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,640
It's them.

239
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,040
Ridiculous.

240
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,840
How can you 280 times?

241
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,960
Stop staring at me.

242
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,120
Tie the locals up

243
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,720
and take them back.

244
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,120
Yes.

245
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,360
Wait, wait, wait.

246
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,360
Don't rush.

247
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,360
Old Li, we are family.

248
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,360
Calm down.

249
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,360
Who is your family?

250
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,360
Who knows?

251
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,360
You are here.

252
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,360
Why don't you choose one?

253
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,360
You are so shameless.

254
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,360
How can you be the Crown Prince of Eastland?

255
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,360
Zhang Wanghuan, that bastard.

256
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,360
Who else can it be?

257
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,360
What a pity for the hard training of Mr. Jiang.

258
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,360
Exactly.

259
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Greetings, Li Long.

260
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,360
I shouldn't have talked to you about this.

261
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,360
But now I have some words to say.

262
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,360
I hope you can listen to me.

263
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,360
This Crown Prince of Southland

264
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,360
looks like a person who knows etiquette.

265
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,360
Please.

266
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,360
Although I only know a few things about Miss A'Si,

267
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,360
I know her martial arts are outstanding.

268
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
She is very talented.

269
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,360
She is very skilled.

270
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,360
She is very talented.

271
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,360
She is a hero.

272
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,360
She is a man.

273
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
It's hard to say.

274
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,360
It's clear that you have been training Miss A'Si

275
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,360
with all your heart and effort.

276
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,360
I think you have been talking about her many times.

277
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,360
You must have been talking about her.

278
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,360
I know her parents love their children.

279
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
But Miss A'Si has escaped from marriage many times.

280
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,360
I think she is not being ungrateful.

281
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,360
She is unwilling to live in a shabby house.

282
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
She wants to imitate the ancestors of thunder.

283
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,360
Her father is a hero in this kind of woman.

284
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,360
She has broken into her own great future.

285
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,360
So a woman like Miss A'Si

286
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,360
is not suitable for ordinary men.

287
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
According to what the Crown Prince said,

288
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,360
what should I do?

289
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,360
Miss A'Si is not ordinary.

290
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,360
How can she be trained in ordinary way?

291
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,360
I don't allow you to have a long memory.

292
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,360
I don't allow you to be able to

293
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,360
learn the art of love.

294
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,360
You can also find someone who knows you.

295
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,360
It's not good to be unparalleled.

296
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,360
Good.

297
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,360
What a person who knows you.

298
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,360
Mr.Gangwen,

299
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,360
where should my son go

300
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,360
to find the person who knows you?

301
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,360
What a coincidence.

302
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,360
Today the Crown Prince Camp is being held.

303
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,360
The Crown Prince Camp is being held.

304
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,360
Today, the whole Mansion of Duke Zhong

305
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,360
will be in full swing.

306
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:21,060
The

307
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,360
A'Si Zexu.

308
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,360
Father, I...

309
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360
Master, is Miss A'Si

310
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,360
still a good wife?

311
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,360
What do you mean?

312
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,360
Take her back to the mansion.

313
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,360
Take off those messy things.

314
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,360
It's annoying to watch.

315
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,360
Thank you.

316
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,360
Father, wait for me.

317
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,360
Really.

318
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,360
Let's go.

319
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,360
You're good.

320
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,360
You're so lucky.

321
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,360
Ding, Zhu San,

322
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,360
where is he? He's here.

323
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,360
I really haven't seen

324
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,360
that Crown Prince of Nandu.

325
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,360
Since you haven't seen him,

326
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,360
why did you lie to us?

327
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,360
Think about it.

328
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,360
I...

329
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,360
You two are both

330
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,360
Crown Prince and a great man.

331
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,360
I can't offend you.

332
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,360
That man also said

333
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,360
that we seem to have seen each other in Nandu.

334
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
He even gave me the steps.

335
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,360
I can't just sit there.

336
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,360
Otherwise, it's not a good step.

337
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,360
He, you're just trying to please

338
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,360
the Crown Prince of Nandu?

339
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,360
Then you said that he looked familiar.

340
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,360
Is it also fake?

341
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
No.

342
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,360
I did feel like I saw him.

343
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,360
But I can't remember.

344
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,360
Really?

345
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,360
Yes.

346
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
Prince of Eishun.

347
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,360
You made me look for you.

348
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
Master Li.

349
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
Why did you

350
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,360
look for Brother Eishun?

351
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,360
Looking for a lady.

352
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,360
I'm a rough man.

353
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,360
I won't make trouble.

354
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
I'll just say it.

355
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,360
Go ahead.

356
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
Prince of Eishun is young.

357
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
He's married.

358
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,360
It's like this.

359
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,360
My girl

360
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,360
is the same age as Prince.

361
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,360
We know each other.

362
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,360
We have a good feeling.

363
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,360
This is a good fate.

364
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,360
Master Li.

365
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,360
I'm worried about the dowry.

366
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,360
It's not a problem.

367
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,360
I'm not from the Shi family.

368
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,360
But in the Eastland,

369
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,360
I'm a rich man.

370
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,360
When I have a child,

371
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,360
including all the food and clothing,

372
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,360
I'll be responsible for everything.

373
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,360
Master Li.

374
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,360
I understand what you mean.

375
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,360
But I'm in the Eagle Division.

376
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,360
I'm not free.

377
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,360
I'm in danger.

378
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,360
The country is in danger.

379
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,360
We can't be hasty.

380
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,360
Don't delay it.

381
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,360
You're right.

382
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,360
Okay.

383
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,360
Since you can't make a decision,

384
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
I'll go to

385
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,360
Duke Nanbo.

386
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,360
I'll go to

387
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,360
Duke Nanbo after

388
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,360
the business here.

389
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,360
I'll discuss it with him.

390
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,360
I know you're young

391
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,360
and tender.

392
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,360
Let the elders

393
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,360
handle these things.

394
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,360
No, Master Li.

395
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,360
It's late.

396
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,360
I'll go now.

397
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,360
Think about it.

398
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,360
Master Li.

399
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,360
Master Li.

400
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,360
What's wrong?

401
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,360
You've thought it over?

402
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,360
No.

403
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,360
Master Li.

404
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,360
When did you

405
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,360
start your wood business?

406
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,360
Wood business?

407
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,360
I've never

408
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,360
done that with Duke Nanbo.

409
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,360
But

410
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,360
I have a wood shop and spices shop.

411
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,360
I've never done

412
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,360
wood business.

413
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,360
Wood business has always been

414
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,360
the business of the official.

415
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,360
It's managed by Duke Dongwu.

416
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,360
I don't think

417
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,360
I should fight with the official.

418
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,360
Take care, Your Highness.

419
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,360
She's

420
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,360
trying to seduce me.

421
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,360
My brother said

422
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,360
the wood business

423
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,360
was going on

424
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,360
in the south.

425
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,360
I didn't expect

426
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,360
it's in the south.

427
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,360
Everyone, the test of the Lion Battalion is coming.

428
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,360
Our Eastland Army Battalion has been preparing for the celebration for years.

429
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,360
To celebrate.

430
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,360
This year's competition is not only a test of everyone's strength.

431
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,360
It's also about choosing a group of elite soldiers and good generals among you.

432
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,360
To form a strong team.

433
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,360
For the King, for Shang Shan, to find the Long-Living Immortal Medicine.

434
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,360
Teacher Gongsun.

435
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,360
Didn't we say that the Long-Living Immortal Medicine of the Holy Treasures of the Han State

436
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,360
was never found since the opening of the state?

437
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,360
Where are we going to find it?

438
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,360
The Long-Living Immortal Medicine is the holy treasure of the Shang Shan.

439
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,360
It has been lost for many years.

440
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,360
But the King has already calculated that

441
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,360
the one who can find the Long-Living Immortal Medicine is among you.

442
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,360
Therefore, this important task is on the Lion Battalion.

443
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,360
Your success and failure

444
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,360
doesn't only represent yourselves.

445
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,360
It also represents the motherland behind you.

446
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,360
It's so quiet.

447
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,360
Jiang Wenhuan, Chong Yibiao, come out.

448
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,360
From today on, you two will each lead a team

449
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,360
to participate in the test competition.

450
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,360
We will not fail the King's order.

451
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,360
Thank you, Your Majesty.

452
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,360
As the saying goes, heroes match good soldiers.

453
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,360
The horse test tomorrow will be a draw.

454
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,360
How can I be able to beat someone to ride a horse?

455
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,360
Brother Xinjia, don't just care about your own treasure.

456
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,360
You are burdened with the task of checking the horse's safety.

457
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,360
Don't worry.

458
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,360
Can you feed this horse more?

459
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,360
Look at how he's getting thinner.

460
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,360
It's easy to say.

461
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,360
Whose horse is this?

462
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,360
Why is he so weak?

463
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,360
Your horse looks very unique.

464
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,360
It's called a cow.

465
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,360
Whose horse is this? Why is it out?

466
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,360
Get in.

467
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,360
What kind of horse is this?

468
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,360
It looks so ugly.

469
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,360
Whose horse is this? Watch it carefully.

470
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,360
This is Brother Jiang's horse?

471
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,360
Yes.

472
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,360
This horse is as strong as a dragon.

473
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,360
This is a good horse.

474
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,360
Brother Echun's horse is not very good.

475
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,360
Let me see.

476
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,360
This horse.

477
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,360
This horse has a poor view and a high head.

478
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,360
It's not very good.

479
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,360
You didn't give him a good horse?

480
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,360
Brother Echun said he's not good at horse riding.

481
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,360
He doesn't have to waste a good horse.

482
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
I remember.

483
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,360
When I was in the south,

484
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,360
I heard about Brother Echun's horse riding.

485
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,360
He's not as good as learning martial arts and getting a good salary.

486
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,360
That's true.

487
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,360
After all, horse riding requires talent.

488
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,360
A man like me who is good at riding and knows horse riding.

489
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,360
How many can he have?

490
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,360
How's the horse?

491
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,360
Brother Jiang, you're here.

492
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,360
You're here.

493
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,360
Brother Jiang, we were just talking about Brother Echun's bad horse riding.

494
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,360
What should we do today?

495
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,360
You're not good at horse riding?

496
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,360
I have a good horse riding skills.

497
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,360
Now I'm too weak to ride.

498
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,360
I can't use my skills.

499
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,360
That slave was really good at horse riding.

500
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,360
It seems that I can only find the answer from the horse race.

501
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,360
The first race of the Aoha competition.

502
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,360
The horse race starts now.

503
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,360
This is the first race.

504
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,360
Echun, Wang Yuanji.

505
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,360
Wang Yuanji.

506
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,360
Brother Wang, charge.

507
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,360
Brother Wang will win.

508
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,360
Charge.

509
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,360

518
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,360
The race starts now.

519
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,360
Charge.

520
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,360
Charge.

521
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,360
Hurry up.

522
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,360
Charge.

523
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,360

525
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,360

Charge.

530
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,360
Charge.

531
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,360
This Echun is really not good at horse riding.

532
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,360
The first round, team Tong wins.

533
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,360
Brother Echun, your horse riding skills are not good.

534
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,360
I'll teach you later.

535
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,360
The second race.

536
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,360
Xinjia.

537
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,360
Su Yuanxiu.

538
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,360
Wait for me to come back.

539
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,360
Brother Su will win.

540
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,360

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,360

547
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,360
Look at the horse.

548
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,360
Brother Xinjia.

549
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,360
Brother Xinjia.

550
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,360
Brother Xinjia, you are getting better at horse riding.

551
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,360
You are getting better.

552
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,360
Our horse riding skills are far from each other.

553
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,360
We need to train hard.

554
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,360
Chase.

555
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,360
Hurry up.

556
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,360

Charge.

558
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,360
The score of the two teams is even.

559
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,360
The next game is a close match.

560
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,360
Chong Yibiao and Jiang Wenhuan

561
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,360
represent the final score of the two teams.

562
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,360
Charge.

563
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,360
Charge.

564
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,360
How can the Northeasterners win the score?

565
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,360
Brother Jiang, you are the winner.

566
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,360
Charge.

567
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,360
The first place.

568
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,360
The first place.

569
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,360
Charge.

570
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,360
Charge.

571
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,360
The one who can win the game will be able to get the first prize.

572
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,360
Brother Jiang, charge.

573
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,360
Charge.

574
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,360
The winner.

575
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,360
The winner.

576
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,360
Charge.

577
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,360
The winner.

578
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,360
The winner.

579
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,360
Charge.

580
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,360
The winner.

581
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,360
Sisne.

582
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,360
Come on.

583
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,360
Start of the game.

584
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,360
The winner.

585
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,360
Whoa.

586
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,360
The winner.

587
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,360
Come on.

588
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,360
Sir, charge.

589
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,360
Charge.

590
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,360
Come on.

591
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,360
estimate

592
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,360
Father.

593
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,360
Retreat!

594
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,120
Retreat!

595
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,120
Retreat!

596
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,640
Retreat!

597
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,640
Retreat!

598
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,640
Retreat!

599
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,640
Retreat!

600
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,640
Retreat!

601
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,640
They're not fighting.

602
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,640
I didn't expect that

603
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,640
the horse-riding skill

604
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,640
can be so different from Chong Xiu's.

605
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,640
Yuan Ji,

606
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,640
don't forget

607
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,640
the bet on horse-riding.

608
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,640
If we win,

609
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
please wash our socks.

610
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,640
It will be so smelly.

611
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,640
Chong Xiu

612
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,640
is the first warrior of the grasslands.

613
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,640
How can he lose?

614
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,920
Come on, Yuan Ji.

615
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,920
Look at our Jiang Xiu's attitude.

616
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,920
I think your Chong Xiu

617
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,920
is not that good.

618
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,920
The gap is too small.

619
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,920
We don't know who will win

620
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,920
until 9 o'clock.

621
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,920
I'm afraid

622
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,920
we will have the last round of winning and losing.

623
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,920
Last round.

624
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,920
They're all retreating.

625
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
They're all retreating.

626
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,920
Brother Zhang!

627
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,920
Brother Zhang!

628
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,920
Brother Lu!

629
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,920
Brother Lu!

630
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,920
As long as Brother Jiang

631
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,920
is the first in the last round,

632
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,920
we will win.

633
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
Retreat!

634
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,920
Retreat!

635
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,920
We won!

636
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,920
We won!

637
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,920
Brother Zhang is about to

638
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,920
win.

639
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,920
We can't lose.

640
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,920
Brother Zhang,

641
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,920
you're the first.

642
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
You're the first.

643
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,920
You're the first.

644
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,920
You're the first.

645
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,240
You're the first.

646
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,240
You're the first!

647
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,840
You're the first!

648
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,840
You're the first!

649
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,840
We've got it!

650
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,840
You're the first!

651
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,840
We've got it!

652
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,840
We've got it!

653
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,840
Brother Lu is almost no longer

654
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,840
with us.

655
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:04,720
He's endangered by the

656
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,880
근

657
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,880
Brother.

658
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,880
Shall we fight for it?

659
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,880
Do it closer to him.

660
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,880
It's dangerous.

661
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,240
But Uncle said we must kill him.

662
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:17,880
Yes.

663
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,280
But I have one more thing you must remember.

664
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,680
The horse's hand

665
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,480
must not be overshadowed by the Chongyi Biao.

666
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,360
Once it's seen through,

667
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,040
we'll all be killed by the sword.

668
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,040
Once we start to take a chance,

669
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,800
we can't turn back.

670
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:05,960
Wait.

671
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,680
Brother Jiang.

672
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,040
Let me.

673
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,840
Well...

674
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,880
Why did Uncle E go?

675
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,400
What did he do?

676
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,520
He said the horse's hand was not overshadowed.

677
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,600
He must have lost.

678
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,280
Go.

679
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,280
Go.

680
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,200
Go.

681
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,360
Go.

682
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:31,920
Go.

683
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,000
Go.

684
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,160
We caught up.

685
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,840
We caught up.

686
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,560
We really did.

687
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,280
The horse's hand of Eushun is so powerful.

688
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:45,880
We caught up.

689
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,520
We caught up.

690
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,600
We're almost there.

691
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,160
Go.

692
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,000
We'll catch up.

693
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,560
We caught up.

694
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,240
We caught up.

695
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,080
We caught up.

696
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,760
So fast.

697
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,360
We caught up.

698
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,360
We caught up.

699
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,040
Is he really that Xiao Lu?

700
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:17,920
Go.

701
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,280
Go.

702
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,560
Good shot.

703
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,760
Captain Jiang won.

704
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,760
Master, we won.

705
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,760
Whoo.

706
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:59,040
Heself

707
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:18,040
You have been out for 150 years

708
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,480
Chongsheng?

709
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,320
Why would I go out?

710
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,320
It's just Ding cooked something delicious.

711
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,640
I'll just go out and have a bite.

712
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,760
Today, on the race track,

713
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,240
that boy...

714
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,000
can't win me.

715
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,240
You mean...

716
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,760
He Shun?

717
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,240
Mr. Kunwu,

718
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,320
what you did today

719
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,720
is indeed inappropriate.

720
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,120
Brother Jiang...

721
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,280
I don't wish to hide it from him.

722
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,280
Could it be that you forgot about the order

723
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,560
my heir left you before he left?

724
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,440
Second Young Master Chong and my heir are quite related.

725
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,760
Now, I'm afraid that you've already seen through the flaw.

726
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,240
He has begun to suspect your identity.

727
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,480
How is his horsemanship?

728
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,040
No one knows it better than I do.

729
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,600
Brother Chong hasn't seen him for many years.

730
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,120
His horsemanship has improved.

731
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,960
It's not surprising.

732
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,960
People have their strengths and weaknesses.

733
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,960
They want to surpass themselves.

734
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,440
It's not something that can be achieved by saying it.

735
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,440
What do you mean by that?

736
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,840
I thought you were a smart person.

737
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,640
You should have understood what I meant.

738
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,440
In short,

739
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,440
I only doubted whether it was true or not.

740
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,040
I'll know after I've tried it.

741
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,040
You mean,

742
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,840
you want to try it in the fighting competition tomorrow?

743
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,240
I came to you

744
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,040
to tell you

745
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,640
not to meddle in other people's affairs.

746
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,200
In France,

747
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,040
Liu Sha is not so good,

748
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:24,440
but my childhood friend,

749
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,640
is forthcoming.

750
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,920
He is looking just like your wife,

751
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:41,040
there is a difference between his age and mine.

752
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,640
Ever since he passed away,

753
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,440
It's for your own good, and for his own good.

754
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,080
Don't forget that you and he aren't on the same side.

755
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,600
I'm very sorry for what I said today.

756
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,220
What?

757
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,960
Tao Yingzhou placed under a thick covers, the winner is Wang Yuanji.

758
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:37,120
The cognitive wealthy match is arranged.

759
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,760
The final match is ruled byルクhidents not foreigners.

760
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:51,160
Science buffering

761
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,080
bolts

762
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,160
Your horse skills have improved a lot

763
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,200
It's over

764
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,340
It seems that you have mastered

765
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,840
the Yandu Handan I taught you.

766
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,340
I'm flattered.

767
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,640
What a pity.

768
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,140
I've never taught you

769
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,140
the Yandu Handan.

770
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,640
The Yandu Handan

771
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,640
What?

772
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,140
You're not going to dodge this time?

773
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,140
Can I

774
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,640
dodge it?

775
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,640
Fine.

776
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
Then I'll have a good fight.

777
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,640
He won yesterday.

778
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,140
That's his luck.

779
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,640
Not today.

780
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,640
Brother Yuanji,

781
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,140
don't be too full of yourself.

782
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,140
Didn't you lose your face yesterday?

783
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,140
I think this Jue Lv

784
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,140
is a little restless today.

785
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,140
You mean

786
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,140
you want to test him in the fighting tomorrow?

787
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,140
I taught him how to ride grass.

788
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,140
He also used a dense fight.

789
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,140
Tomorrow,

790
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,140
I deliberately showed him this skill

791
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,140
and let him fight.

792
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,140
If he knows it,

793
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,640
he should be fine.

794
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,640
But

795
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,640
if he doesn't know it...

796
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,640
We won!

797
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,640
Brother Yuanji,

798
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,640
I've said it.

799
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,640
Don't be too full of yourself.

800
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,640
How is that possible?

801
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,640
Today's fighting competition

802
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,640
the winner is

803
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,140
Jiang Wenhuan.

804
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,140
We won!

805
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,140
We won!

806
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,140
Stop!

807
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,140
Who are you?

808
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,140
You're not him.

809
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,140
Who are you?

810
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,140
One when life finally ends

811
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,140
We all don't know

812
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,140
how gone life has become

813
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,140
If you could tell me

814
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:12,140
Isn't that

815
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,440
A dream from a distance

816
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,640
While I think about you

817
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,140
My mind argue

818
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,940
There's something Jesus advises

819
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,440
When everyone is in misfortune

820
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:33,720
but my pride and pride were unable to contain and vase it to phrase.

821
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,600
Endless hatred and greedyenario has been living in the dust.

822
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,100
I always

823
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,060
always

824
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,600
college graduation.

825
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:56,340
Embracing thearf the members who missed their

826
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,420
What's going on?

827
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,180
I wonder what happened to all of you.

828
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,340
The two of you,

829
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,460
were not at the scene.

830
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,700
Could there have suggesting that

831
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:12,680
the second acting ofăngduo

832
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,300
was really unpacked.

833
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,780
on下

834
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:19,200
At the transactions for the prima fide

835
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,740
but we are held at the same precious place

836
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,840
was like

837
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,680
Myendre

838
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,880
business

839
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,140
turf

840
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:27,820
above

841
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,820
The End
