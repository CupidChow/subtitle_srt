1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,080
Sound of the Desert

2
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,120
Episode 2

3
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,000
Never Ending

4
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,400
To be still

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,400
How can I explain to my brother?

6
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,800
If I can't find out the truth,

7
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,000
how can I face

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,600
seeing my brother?

9
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,160
You're dead.

10
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,320
You should take care of yourself.

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If I could

12
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,400
come here earlier,

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,200
Sister Yiyang...

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,200
It's my fault.

15
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm ashamed to be a brother.

16
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,920
I heard about your injury.

17
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,240
How are you?

18
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,440
I took the medicine Yiyang gave me.

19
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,640
I feel much better.

20
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,440
Before she left,

21
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,440
she was still acting as a sister for me.

22
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,240
Don't worry.

23
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,760
We'll find the real murderer

24
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,640
and find out the truth about Yiyang.

25
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,640
What kind of

26
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,840
unspeakable secret

27
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,040
is hidden here?

28
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,040
So many people died for nothing.

29
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,640
Is Yiyang's death

30
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,640
related to the longevity pill?

31
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
Actually,

32
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,240
I came to Zhongli to find you

33
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,440
because of the longevity pill.

34
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,440
This smell is...

35
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,640
Why is there a drug

36
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,640
as poisonous as Jiang Wenhuan's

37
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,040
in the antidote?

38
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,640
Anaxin.

39
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,040
Let's go.

40
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,640
This is...

41
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,240
Isn't this the place?

42
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
Where did you find

43
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
the young master Anash?

44
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,240
In the forest in the suburbs.

45
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,240
I found a person from the Ghost Realm

46
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,240
carrying him.

47
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
Could it be him?

48
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,240
After the separation of Donglu City that day,

49
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,240
I contacted my father

50
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,240
in Ning Zhou's old department

51
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,240
to find out

52
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,240
if there were still people

53
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,240
in the world

54
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,240
besides me.

55
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,240
I didn't expect

56
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
to meet a lady

57
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,240
from the Southern Capital

58
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,240
on the way to the Tushan Village.

59
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,240
You mean...

60
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,240
Yes.

61
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,240
This is the son of Duke Nan Bo,

62
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,240
E Shun.

63
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,240
Are you looking for

64
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,240
the secret cave in Tushan?

65
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
Who are you?

66
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,240
The secret cave in Tushan?

67
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,240
Later I found out

68
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,240
that this crown prince

69
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,240
was investigating

70
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,240
the buried cloud of Tushan.

71
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,240
He brought us

72
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
to a secret cave

73
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,240
in Tushan

74
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,240
where we found

75
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,240
something.

76
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,620
to the

77
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,740
How should I take it important

78
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,600
You go ahead

79
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,840
Kui Ba Shi?

80
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:29,960
Yes.

81
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,120
And in Kui Ba Shi's mouth

82
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,400
is a thing

83
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,600
that makes people think of Lian Pian.

84
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,640
What is it?

85
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,120
It's a half-cut ring.

86
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,200
The owner of this ring

87
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,640
might have taken the Immortal Medicine.

88
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,160
Duke Nan Bo's son found out

89
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,120
that after the Great Change of Ning Zhou,

90
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,560
a man named Tu Shan Hou Yi ran to the Eastland.

91
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,400
He is good at speaking and playing the music.

92
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
He might be an ordinary man.

93
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,280
He's dead.

94
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,720
Huan, remember.

95
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,840
The king is the ruler.

96
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,000
The people are the leaders.

97
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,160
The people are the foundation.

98
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,840
The country is the foundation.

99
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,120
You should be righteous

100
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,640
and upright

101
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,400
and protect the people.

102
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,560
Master.

103
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,840
Is it really you?

104
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,840
Master.

105
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,400
I brought you something.

106
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,040
This is the Blue-Haired Manor.

107
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,160
This is a pot that Shanggu passed down for a long time.

108
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,520
Where did you get it?

109
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,600
A-Si brought it from Ning Zhou.

110
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,000
Ning Zhou?

111
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,840
Master.

112
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,360
You haven't been back to Ning Zhou for a long time, right?

113
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,240
A-Si said

114
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,200
that after the Great Change of Ning Zhou 16 years ago,

115
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,400
he was blamed by the king for the water loss.

116
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,600
The people of Ning Zhou are like the Tu Shan people.

117
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,240
They rely on the music of the dance and music.

118
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,880
Master, do you know about the Tu Shan Village?

119
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,600
I know.

120
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,320
How much do you know?

121
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,160
What's wrong?

122
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,040
Master is from Ning Zhou.

123
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,320
These years,

124
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,320
I've never heard you mention

125
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,120
why Ning Zhou was attacked by the Tu Shan Village.

126
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,120
Also,

127
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,440
what's wrong with your limbs?

128
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,680
They were injured.

129
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,480
Where?

130
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,560
Who hurt them?

131
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,440
Huan.

132
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,200
Are you suspecting something?

133
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,600
Master.

134
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,280
You're the one I don't want to suspect.

135
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,520
It seems that if my disciple

136
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,240
can't get the answer today,

137
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,720
he won't give up.

138
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:38,920
Yes.

139
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,880
Tu Shan Village?

140
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,920
I know about the Tu Shan Village.

141
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,880
I saw it with my own eyes.

142
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,200
Miss.

143
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,360
How is it?

144
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,160
Mr. Xingjia has told us about it.

145
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,200
Don't worry, Miss.

146
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,040
With us here,

147
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,040
we won't let anything happen to you and Mr. Jiang.

148
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,600
Okay.

149
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,000
So the old man and woman of Tu Shan Village

150
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
were caught in the cave

151
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,320
and then tried to kill Changsheng.

152
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,840
They were all killed.

153
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,680
The old man and woman of Tu Shan Village

154
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,560
were all killed.

155
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,000
Then they tried to kill Changsheng.

156
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,720
Tu Shan Village

157
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,960
has been isolated from the world for generations.

158
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,360
It has never been in contact with people.

159
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,320
It was only because of a fake

160
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,320
Changsheng fairy medicine that Tu Village was harmed.

161
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,280
There are 307 people in the village.

162
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,440
None of them are alive.

163
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,280
One of them is out of the village.

164
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,240
That day,

165
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,920
he took his newborn child

166
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,400
out of the sea

167
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,920
and fled to the east road.

168
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,240
He was captured by bandits

169
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,720
and was only injured by bandits.

170
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,840
Later,

171
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,520
the young master of the Eastern Marquis's Mansion

172
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,640
came to save him.

173
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,080
He took him back to his mansion

174
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,440
and made him a musician.

175
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,840
He was the only one who survived.

176
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,200
He just wanted to save him.

177
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,120
He was alive.

178
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,000
He was born

179
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,320
and never woke up.

180
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,640
Master,

181
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,400
I've never heard you mention these things.

182
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,960
I'm Tu Shan Yu Nian.

183
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,560
I can't see my identity.

184
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,000
When you were little,

185
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,600
your brother didn't tell you

186
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,760
because he was afraid you might be blind.

187
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,320
Hua,

188
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,600
I really don't want to get the Eastern Marquis's Mansion involved.

189
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,120
I don't want to

190
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,120
get your brother involved.

191
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,120
Of course not.

192
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,520
So what if Tu Shan is a descendant?

193
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,040
As long as Master didn't do anything

194
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,120
that would hurt the heaven,

195
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,680
why should His Majesty blame him?

196
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,480
Instead, His Majesty

197
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,240
is thinking about the immortality and immortality every day.

198
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,000
He used human power

199
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,080
to make a fool of himself.

200
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,160
Hua,

201
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,800
the tragic events in Tu Shan Village

202
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,600
were all caused by Ning Bo Hou.

203
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,120
His Majesty was looking for the medicine

204
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,360
to get rid of him.

205
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,240
I only hate

206
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,600
the fate of Tu Shan Village

207
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
and hate the immortality and immortality to ruin the world.

208
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,960
So this time, when I return to the capital,

209
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,360
I'll tell His Majesty

210
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,360
the truth about the immortality and immortality

211
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,720
and clear the name of the Tu Shan family.

212
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,840
Master,

213
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,920
have you ever heard

214
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,480
of any descendants of Tu Shan escaping from heaven?

215
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,520
The Tu Shan Village was in great trouble

216
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,920
and perhaps more than I could escape from.

217
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,960
I don't know.

218
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,040
Actually,

219
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,920
A-Si was also born in Tu Shan.

220
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,320
He was also a descendant of Tu Shan.

221
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,480
So the people of Tu Shan Village

222
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,560
didn't die.

223
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,960
It's a kind of love.

224
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,600
Yes.

225
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,760
If you have time,

226
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,480
you can talk to A-Si about the past of Tu Shan.

227
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,440
Maybe you're still relatives.

228
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,600
In this case,

229
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,320
I must talk to Miss A-Si.

230
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,720
Childe Chong,

231
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,920
you're back?

232
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,240
Eldest brother-in-law,

233
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,600
where did you find me?

234
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,560
We was on a deserted mountain

235
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,800
looking for monsters everywhere.

236
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,160
Yet we just found your greedy son.

237
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,000
This cannot be happening.

238
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,000
And彭艾粉 block has

239
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,200
How did Yi Yao die?

240
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,720
Yi Yao is a good child.

241
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,240
It's a pity.

242
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,080
But no matter who killed Yi Yao,

243
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,520
he died in this unfair world.

244
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,840
Believe it or not, I'll kill you now.

245
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,400
No matter how you hate me,

246
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,960
you can't kill me now.

247
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,040
Because only I

248
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,080
can bring Yi Yao back to life.

249
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,560
I have the Immortal Medicine.

250
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,240
This is the way to train him.

251
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,800
Blood is the source of the drink.

252
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,000
Wine is the source of the plum.

253
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,920
I am the blood of the Tushan clan.

254
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,320
Only I can train the Immortal Medicine.

255
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,920
You want to turn Yi Yao into a monster who lives or dies?

256
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,040
So what?

257
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,240
At least,

258
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,680
he can stay by your side forever.

259
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,760
Isn't it?

260
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,400
Yi Yao is only sixteen years old.

261
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,880
He should be of a good age.

262
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,920
Do you really want to see him

263
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,200
in a box of soil

264
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,560
and become a pile of bones?

265
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,160
If you follow me,

266
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,760
you can save your life.

267
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,360
When he comes back,

268
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,480
you can take him to the sky and the sea.

269
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,880
You'll be with him.

270
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,760
Who dares to say he's a monster?

271
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,080
You were born to be a mother.

272
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,880
Your father died.

273
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,160
Your mother died.

274
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,680
Your father died.

275
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,000
Your brothers died.

276
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,960
You should have been given a warm place.

277
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,600
They all left you.

278
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,520
But you failed.

279
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,400
It's rare to have a Yi Yao

280
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,560
who can help you achieve your dream.

281
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,840
Now, God gives you a chance to change him.

282
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,400
Don't you want to try for him?

283
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,840
Yi Yao,

284
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,600
I'll bring you home,

285
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
no matter what.

286
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,520
It's so dark,

287
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,600
and it's больше than the animals.

288
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,360
Aren't you tired?

289
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,600
Are you okay?

290
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,960
I'm fine.

291
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,920
Jiang.

292
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,280
Do you know

293
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,600
the people living inside the village

294
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,400
have some wounds that become fresh?

295
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,280
Is this person really sent by Gongsun Master to kill Miss A-Si?

296
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,280
Today, I deliberately revealed your identity to her.

297
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,640
No one knows except her.

298
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,000
I didn't expect that she still couldn't help it.

299
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,760
This mark is...

300
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,920
Master, why didn't you change your name to Hao Zhong?

301
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,040
Hao Jiao Chang Ming has always been a man of his word.

302
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,840
That's why he's called Hao Zhong.

303
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,040
Hao Zhong Qian.

304
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,440
Master, Li A-Si has been rescued by Jiang Wenhuan and his men.

305
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,160
He still...

306
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,840
didn't believe me.

307
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,040
Go and inform the Taotie Army outside the city.

308
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,760
They'll come to the city tomorrow to take over Zhongli.

309
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,360
Yes.

310
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,800
It's all right.

311
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,320
Until now,

312
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,520
no one can stop our great cause.

313
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,040
Taotie's vanguard, listen to my order.

314
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,800
Yes.

315
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,440
Follow me to the city to deliver the order.

316
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,760
Come on, let's go.

317
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,800
The people in the city,

318
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,600
hurry up and come to receive the order.

319
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,720
What happened?

320
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,040
What happened?

321
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,440
What happened?

322
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,680
What happened?

323
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,440
Where did Wenhuan and Xingjia go?

324
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,360
Why aren't they here?

325
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,000
His Majesty's order is here.

326
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,440
Zhongli rebels.

327
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,160
They have committed a crime.

328
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,960
The Taotie Army is ordered to take over the city.

329
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,720
What happened?

330
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,880
What happened?

331
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,960
What happened?

332
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,400
What happened?

333
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,760
Lord Gongsun,

334
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,320
I've never received such a heavy imperial edict before.

335
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,880
Is there anything strange about it?

336
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,160
General,

337
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,360
do you not know the imperial edict

338
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,000
or don't want to know it?

339
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,120
Taotie Army, listen to my order.

340
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,280
Kill them.

341
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,080
Wait.

342
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,520
The earth is bare.

343
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,560
The tribesmanprochen by the least gentleman

344
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,760
break out to live life,

345
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,120
sis him through the staff of the throne.

346
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,680
No anest SECRETARY JONGLI built.

347
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,520
But how can innocent people

348
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,160
make a truth through the politics of people.

349
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,320
Zhongli rebels

350
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,280
are trying to disturb the South Kingdom.

351
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,760
His Majesty's order to audiobook

352
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,560
the truth is to favour the safety of the South Kingdom.

353
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,480
Crown prince,

354
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,920
you want to

355
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,920
Is it the king's order?

356
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,440
The king is the god.

357
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,720
It's hard to follow the order.

358
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,520
If you don't obey,

359
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,680
it's not loyal.

360
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,720
Please step aside, Your Highness.

361
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,720
One more step

362
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,440
and you'll be my enemy.

363
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,480
You!

364
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,840
You!

365
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,080
You even want to represent the capital?

366
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,000
Chong,

367
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,680
what does that mean?

368
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,480
Chong,

369
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,680
our Nanci

370
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,560
and the weak people who are so weak as to protect Sun Tiantian.

371
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,920
What do you want?

372
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,720
Their lives

373
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,720
have nothing to do with me.

374
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,920
I only know

375
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,640
that the king's order is not to be violated.

376
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,920
Chong Yubiao,

377
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,400
how could you do this?

378
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,920
If you can't protect the people of Wei State

379
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,360
and let us kill the Crown Prince,

380
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,360
what's the use?

381
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,080
Chong Yubiao,

382
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Wang Yuanji

383
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,120
always sees you as the best warrior in North Grassland.

384
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,280
But in the end,

385
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,280
you're just a despicable villain

386
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,760
who is trying to make a name for himself.

387
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,960
Brother Chong,

388
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,920
you made such a choice today.

389
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,360
Our love for each other

390
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,520
and our brotherhood

391
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,560
are all useless.

392
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,240
Between us,

393
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,040
I'm not getting married with you.

394
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,400
to make Ying'er happy?

395
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,920
How is it water ?

396
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:21,980
Kill them all

397
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,220
Slowly

398
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,780
Are you guys going to let me down?

399
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,680
A big demonstration

400
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,580
Come on

401
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:28,780
suggestion

402
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,400
Everyone come in

403
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,660
I must do it

404
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,500
Who are you guys?

405
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,280
Master

406
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:34,700
Right

407
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,660
Master

408
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,860
Just put down my sword

409
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,040
Go

410
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,080
個多點

411
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,700
Think first

412
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:45,820
So, I just

413
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,040
won't dare to momentarily

414
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,460
what

415
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,300
you guys

416
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,020
Yes, Your Highness.

417
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,340
Your Highness, listen to my order.

418
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,020
Take the city by storm.

419
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:54,980
Yes, Your Highness.

420
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,860
Protect the people.

421
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,220
Don't let them escape.

422
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,220
Jiang Wenhui,

423
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,500
get out of the way.

424
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:04,700
Master,

425
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,060
I'm sorry

426
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,100
that I couldn't make it this time.

427
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,820
Lord Gongsun,

428
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,780
they are all the princes of the Marquis.

429
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,340
Should we attack them or...

430
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,780
Pass my order.

431
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,260
Stop outside the city.

432
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,660
The four gates must be locked.

433
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,940
If there's a fly, it will fly out.

434
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:30,660
Yes.

435
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,620
Lord Cao, listen to my order.

436
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,620
Yes.

437
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,380
Jiang Wenhui,

438
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,860
listen to me.

439
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,580
If we fail,

440
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,380
I'll give you another chance.

441
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,140
After tonight,

442
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,820
if you go back on your way,

443
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,420
I won't hold you accountable.

444
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,780
If you insist on defying me,

445
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,540
don't blame me for not remembering my old feelings.

446
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,020
Protect the people of Zhongli and retreat.

447
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,500
Jiang Xiong,

448
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,300
retreat.

449
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:10,760
The

450
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:18,980
Jiang Xiong,

451
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,340
you mean

452
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,340
the assassin who introduced Miss Asi last night

453
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,260
is Lord Gongsun's bodyguard?

454
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,020
And you deduce that

455
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,420
today, Lord Gongsun

456
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,940
will be unfaithful to Zhongli.

457
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,860
So,

458
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,140
Lord Gongsun

459
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,100
is really the descendant of Tushan Village in Ningzhou,

460
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,380
the ancient tribe of Bi Hua Sheng?

461
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,180
Yes.

462
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,580
After Tushan Village was attacked by Changsheng County,

463
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,540
he hid himself and took revenge.

464
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:43,820
Among them,

465
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,620
there's Guifang's help.

466
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,220
So, the Guifang people of Su Village

467
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,180
are also related to Lord Gongsun?

468
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,060
When Tushan Village was attacked,

469
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,060
Gongsun was called Xuan Yin.

470
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,100
His father Hao Zhong was the Guifang's son.

471
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,020
They were a family.

472
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,220
When Tushan Village was attacked,

473
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,340
Hao Zhong died for the village.

474
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,060
Gongsun and his son were left alone.

475
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,580
I don't understand.

476
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,260
Why did he take revenge on Zhongli?

477
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:13,940
Maybe

478
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,860
it's related to the medicine we're looking for.

479
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,380
This time,

480
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,700
Asi went back to Ningzhou

481
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,140
and found a broken pendant

482
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,700
in Tushan's sacred land.

483
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,420
I'm afraid

484
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,980
the owner of the pendant is Master.

485
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,740
Household of Tushan

486
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,720
Hao Zhong,

487
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,420
Go- to Meiling zumnisk

488
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,340
16 years.

489
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,220
I finally waited for this day.

490
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,340
Nice stuff

491
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:40,780
what are you doing

492
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,220
ten thousand

493
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:54,860
ten thousand

494
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,440
Ten thousand

495
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,680
ten thousand

496
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,040
ten thousand

497
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,060
Come on.

498
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,500
Do you remember this?

499
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,740
When you were injured and fainted in Mount Tushan,

500
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,220
you wore this mask.

501
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,700
I just don't know why you kept it.

502
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,620
This mask

503
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,060
scared a lot of people.

504
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,020
But you were so bold

505
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,420
and brought me back to my home.

506
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,260
Xuanyi.

507
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,500
Actually, this mask

508
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:25,980
has another identity.

509
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,060
It's the symbol of my Guifang and Guizhou.

510
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,460
You must remember.

511
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,740
If one day

512
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,860
you and your child face any difficulties,

513
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,420
you must hold this mask and ask for help from Guifang.

514
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,460
They will treat you and your son

515
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,020
with respect and respect.

516
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,820
As long as you're here,

517
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,140
we're not afraid of anything.

518
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:52,900
What's wrong?

519
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,940
You kicked me again.

520
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,860
You're naughty.

521
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,260
If it's like me,

522
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,540
I'll call it a sharp sword.

523
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,740
If it's like you,

524
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,620
you can call it a self-drawing.

525
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,460
What do you think?

526
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,900
Xuanyi. Xuanyi.

527
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,340
Xuanyi. Xuanyi.

528
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,220
Bad news.

529
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,140
What's wrong?

530
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,660
There's someone from the mountain.

531
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,460
They said they wanted to take my Mount Tushan

532
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,940
and give me the Immortality Herb.

533
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,140
What's the Immortality Herb?

534
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,660
Give me the Immortality Herb.

535
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,900
I'll spare your lives.

536
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,300
I've been protecting the Immortality Herb

537
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,260
for generations.

538
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,980
I did it for the sake of

539
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,300
the thing that doesn't belong to the mortal world

540
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,060
and doesn't belong to the mortal world.

541
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,420
It's absurd.

542
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,220
It's a sin to be under the heaven.

543
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,020
The Immortality Herb

544
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,340
is the opening gift from the Nine-tailed Fox

545
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:56,140
to me, the late Immortal An of Mount Shang.

546
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,620
Why do you need to protect it?

547
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,940
I'm a fan of it.

548
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,260
Enough.

549
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,180
Are you done?

550
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,140
Be quiet.

551
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,140
There's a rumor about the Mount Tushan.

552
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,660
The Immortality Herb is in danger.

553
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,180
If you kill my family,

554
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,140
you won't get the Immortality Herb.

555
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,100
You!

556
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,540
Say that again!

557
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,660
Report!

558
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,740
There's a cave in the cliff behind the mountain.

559
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,300
Good.

560
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,300
The Immortality Herb must be in the Eastern Palace.

561
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,380
Go and search.

562
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,140
I'll kill you!

563
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:31,860
You're a bastard!

564
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,700
Am I?

565
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,820
Stop!

566
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,620
It's no use keeping them.

567
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,620
You guys watch carefully.

568
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,100
The rest, follow me.

569
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:39,780
Yes.

570
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,100
Be careful.

571
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,060
Stop!

572
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,140
Brother, hurry.

573
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,820
Take Xuanyin away from Mount Tushan.

574
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,100
Hurry. No.

575
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,540
That year, the Immortality Herb

576
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,620
broke the rule that

577
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,460
people of other tribes can't live with.

578
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,180
Now, he even asked me to

579
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,500
join the Xuan Yin Clan.

580
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,100
Now, Mount Tushan is in danger.

581
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,380
I can't leave.

582
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,660
Hurry up.

583
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,500
This place is dangerous.

584
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,140
Tell Xuanyin to leave this place.

585
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,540
Sister Xuanyin,

586
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,220
go.

587
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,540
We can't make it if we don't leave now.

588
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,860
Where's Brother Hao Zhong?

589
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,980
Brother Hao Zhong is here to save Sister Dai.

590
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,940
No one is here.

591
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,140
Impossible.

592
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,340
Impossible.

593
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,940
He said

594
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,820
he would spend his whole life with me and my child.

595
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,460
Impossible.

596
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,660
Sister Xuanyin.

597
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,740
Sister Xuanyin.

598
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,780
Sister Xuanyin.

599
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:54,820
Sister Xuanyin.

600
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,140
Sister Xuanyin.

601
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,140
Take this child away.

602
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:00,540
Yes.

603
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,380
Where are you taking him?

604
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,820
Let me go.

605
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,620
Let me go.

606
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,260
The Queen Mother said

607
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,300
no matter who you are,

608
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,540
as long as you're from Mount Tushan,

609
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,620
take the medicine with you.

610
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,260
Take him away.

611
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,140
Don't touch me.

612
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:13,900
Go.

613
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,380
How did Gongsun Wu Yu

614
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,140
become the Grand Minister of the State

615
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,220
after he was killed by the

616
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,420
Emperor of the State?

617
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,580
Master was rescued by my brother

618
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,620
on the way to escape from the disaster of the Anas.

619
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,780
He was taken back to the Marquis of the Eastern Kingdom.

620
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,740
He took this opportunity

621
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,940
to enter the Eastern Continent as a teacher of the Jiang family.

622
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,540
He also learned that His Majesty liked music.

623
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,380
He was recommended by the Marquis of the Eastern Kingdom

624
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,780
with a wonderful zither.

625
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,100
He was promoted all the way.

626
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,980
He entered the power center of the capital

627
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,380
and taught the music of the Crown Prince.

628
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,100
He was valued by His Majesty.

629
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,180
I see.

630
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,860
Then what does Mr. Gongsun

631
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,940
have to do with the medicine of the Immortals?

632
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,620
Back then,

633
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,060
Marquis Ningbo was punished by His Majesty

634
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,020
for not finding the medicine.

635
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,300
He was also sent back to the capital.

636
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,900
I can infer that

637
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,140
the medicine of the Immortals

638
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,340
must be in someone else's hands.

639
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,300
Then this person

640
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,860
should be Mr. Gongsun.

641
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,580
After that,

642
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,780
he was controlled by the Ghosts of the Ghosts

643
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,180
who left the Su Village.

644
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,180
The Ghosts of the Ghosts

645
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,740
were sealed and killed

646
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,900
in order to bring back the Divine Bone.

647
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,580
It was written in the Holy安遗诏.

648
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,860
The medicine of the Immortals and the Divine Bone

649
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,860
can't be kept here.

650
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,660
But according to the current situation,

651
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,620
Master

652
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,380
should have the answer.

653
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:34,900
So,

654
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,860
I'm afraid that

655
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,300
the Holy安遗诏 has come true.

656
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,820
The medicine of the Immortals and the Divine Bone

657
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,180
can never be together.

658
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,260
Otherwise, the nine states will be destroyed

659
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,260
and the world will be in chaos.

660
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,700
And now,

661
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,980
it's the right time to make this decision.

662
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,420
I don't understand.

663
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,460
If the two states really have such power,

664
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,860
what's the use of it?

665
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,100
Practicing poetry.

666
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,340
Practicing poetry?

667
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,100
Yes.

668
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,340
The soldiers of the Kun family

669
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,220
who became monsters

670
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,940
were just confused by the sound of drums

671
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,340
and were crazy to kill people.

672
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,860
There was also a person who was on the fight

673
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,340
and attacked our Kui Pa Shi.

674
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,300
That should be Gongsun Wu Yu,

675
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,580
the first monster

676
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,380
who practiced in the Tu Mountain Village.

677
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:18,900
But

678
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,860
there was no help from the Divine Bone.

679
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,460
So, he was so angry

680
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,060
that he bit off his tailbone.

681
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,460
I didn't expect that

682
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,420
all of this was done by Mr. Gongsun.

683
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,780
That gentle and gentle man

684
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,340
is the one who killed Mr. Gongsun of Lan Xing.

685
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,820
If our guess

686
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,580
is true,

687
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,020
then

688
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,660
what are you going to do?
