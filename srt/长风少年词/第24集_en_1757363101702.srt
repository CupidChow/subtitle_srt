1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:27,720
Sorry for the cross-

2
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,000
I can't help it.

3
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,120
No, I have to go out.

4
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,320
Brother Jiang said

5
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,640
before the Central Plains Banquet,

6
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,560
if there is no important matter,

7
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,640
you can't leave the post.

8
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,880
No.

9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,840
The State Preceptor is dead.

10
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,440
Why are you still defending?

11
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,640
Anyway,

12
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,960
Brother Jiang arranged it like this.

13
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,040
He has his own reason.

14
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,840
Besides,

15
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,040
Brother Chong is guarding it.

16
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,080
You can't go out.

17
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,200
It's up to me.

18
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,440
You're getting more and more sporadic.

19
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,440
Without making it more and moreÄ±mffefinng,

20
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,080
your chances of getting off the post

21
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,600
are too low.

22
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,720
What result do you have?

23
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:26,640
A hopefully

24
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,640
Go back.

25
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,640
You're good.

26
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,640
You're really good at the Jue Ling.

27
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,640
How's the medicine?

28
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,640
After trying many methods,

29
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,640
I found that the blood crystal was powdered.

30
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,640
Then I added the herbs and the blood of Lin Fu Jiang.

31
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,640
Then I could cure your poison.

32
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,640
You mean,

33
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,640
use Lin Fu Jiang's blood to feed me the medicine?

34
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,640
You want to poison me?

35
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,640
I remember,

36
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,640
the blood on the will of the Holy Ancestral Ancestral.

37
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,640
The Long Life Pill is the best medicine in the world.

38
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,640
It's the time when the blood crystal is back.

39
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,640
I didn't expect that

40
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,640
the blood crystal

41
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,640
is really a heart-wrenching poison.

42
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
Since the blood crystal

43
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,640
is a 80-degree star,

44
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,640
what role does the human skin bone

45
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,640
of the Su Village play?

46
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,640
The bone is made by the human skin of the You Su clan.

47
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,640
Just like what we saw in the forest.

48
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,640
The bone is like a magic trick

49
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,640
that can control people's hearts,

50
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,640
and change minds.

51
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,640
Brother, don't worry.

52
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,640
I have the antidote to clear the spirit of the spirit.

53
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,640
I can keep you all clear.

54
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,640
Li Yao, you're really something.

55
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,640
In this case,

56
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,640
tomorrow's banquet will be a complete failure.

57
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,640
Brother,

58
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,640
Brother Jiang asked me to tell you

59
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,640
to prepare yourself.

60
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,640
Tomorrow, we'll go to the palace to prepare for the banquet.

61
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,640
Okay, I got it.

62
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,640
Luckily, I was careful

63
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,640
and observed the surroundings.

64
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,640
It's so stubborn.

65
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,640
It's a little trapped and wild.

66
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
It's so tender.

67
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,640
It's almost gone.

68
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,640
I didn't even have a good time

69
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,640
in the Zhongli Kingdom.

70
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,640
It seems that the Zhongli Kingdom

71
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,640
is not bad.

72
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,640
The cakes have just been baked.

73
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
Have a look.

74
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,640
Ladies and gentlemen,

75
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,640
the cake is ready.

76
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,640
Thank you.

77
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,640
Thank you.

78
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,640
Thank you.

79
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
Before the celebration,

80
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,640
any item that enters the mouth

81
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,640
must be used to test the bone.

82
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,640
Only then can it enter the mouth.

83
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,640
Master.

84
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,640
Master.

85
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,640
Come on.

86
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,640
In addition,

87
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,640
before the celebration,

88
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,640
you can't meet strangers in person.

89
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,640
I can't touch it.

90
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,640
I can't eat it.

91
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,640
It's better to go back to the river

92
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,640
to get rid of the impurities.

93
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,640
You want to run away?

94
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,640
Come here.

95
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,640
Run away.

96
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,640
You want to run away?

97
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,640
Brothers,

98
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,640
in the public,

99
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,640
a girl like this

100
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
is not suitable.

101
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,640
Her father lost his family property

102
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,640
to me.

103
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,640
He even stole my things.

104
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,640
I'm not enough

105
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,640
to pay off the debt with this girl.

106
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,640
You don't care about anything.

107
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,640
And

108
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,640
don't make trouble

109
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
for the most important thing.

110
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,640
Don't cause trouble.

111
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,640
I don't care about anything.

112
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,640
You run away.

113
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,640
You run away.

114
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,640
You can't beat him to death.

115
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,640
Even if you can't beat him to death now,

116
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,640
you will not live long

117
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,640
if you can't beat him to death.

118
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,640
Let go of me.

119
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,640
Although I'm not a hero,

120
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,640
but if she has the ability to

121
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
fight against the enemy,

122
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,640
I'll be convinced by the crown prince.

123
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
Stop.

124
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,640
How much did her father lose to you?

125
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,640
What?

126
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,640
You want to pay off his debt?

127
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,640
Can you afford it?

128
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,640
I want the girl

129
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,640
today.

130
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,640
Who said I want to pay off his debt?

131
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,640
But

132
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,640
you said this girl is a gambling.

133
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,640
Why don't we gamble?

134
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,640
I won.

135
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,640
If this girl

136
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,640
follows me,

137
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,640
if I lose,

138
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,640
this girl

139
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,640
follows you

140
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,640
with me.

141
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,640
You're so skilled.

142
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,640
You're so skilled.

143
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,640
You're so skilled.

144
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,640
I'm sure I can do it.

145
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,640
I'm sure I can do it.

146
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,640
How is that possible?

147
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,640
What's wrong?

148
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
You've lost more than ten times.

149
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,640
You still don't continue?

150
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,640
I'm willing to gamble.

151
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,640
So many people of Zhongli Country are watching.

152
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,640
You don't want to cheat, do you?

153
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,640
Yes.

154
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,640
You're so good at gambling.

155
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,640
You're so good at gambling.

156
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,640
You can go.

157
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,640
Take the money.

158
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
It's enough to use for a while.

159
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,640
Childe.

160
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
If you don't mind,

161
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,640
I'll give you this sachet.

162
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,640
The grass inside

163
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,640
can remove insects and keep warm.

164
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,640
You're a good person and you have good news.

165
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,640
You can definitely be a good person.

166
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
Okay.

167
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,640
I'll take the sachet.

168
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,640
I won't keep the person.

169
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,640
Brother Chong.

170
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
This...

171
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
This...

172
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,640
You'll miss me

173
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,640
if you don't see me later.

174
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,640
Brother Chong, sit down.

175
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,640
Don't hit my ear.

176
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,640
It hurts.

177
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
What's wrong, Brother Chong?

178
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,640
Why are you fighting?

179
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,640
What do you mean by fighting?

180
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
I'm being beaten up on one side.

181
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
Say it.

182
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,640
Where did you go?

183
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,640
I just feel like going out to play.

184
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,640
What?

185
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,640
Sister, I'm sorry.

186
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,640
I'm sorry.

187
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
I'm sorry.

188
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,640
I'm sorry.

189
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,640
What?

190
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
Brother Xingxia.

191
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,640
You really went out?

192
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,640
I just went out to take a breath.

193
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,640
You're being reasonable.

194
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,640
Come here.

195
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,640
Say it.

196
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,640
Where did you go?

197
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,640
Who did you see?

198
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,640
What did you do?

199
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,640
I didn't see anyone.

200
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,640
I didn't do anything.

201
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,640
What do you mean by you didn't do anything?

202
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,640
This...

203
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,640
This is a sachet.

204
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
A sachet?

205
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,640
I said how can it be fragrant and fragrant?

206
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,640
What's wrong with this sachet?

207
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,640
It's very rare.

208
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,640
Since the beginning of the Tang Dynasty,

209
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,640
no foreign object can be entered.

210
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
Cold blood is ruthless.

211
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,640
Jue Lv, this is not over for you.

212
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,640
Stop.

213
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,640
Now the Crown Prince's camp is not strong enough.

214
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,640
I can attack the country very quickly.

215
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,640
I finally have to wait for the moment of revenge.

216
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,640
Then we have to attack the country in advance.

217
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,640
I didn't expect that the real body of the Commander-in-Chief

218
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,640
is so unexpected.

219
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
That's right.

220
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,640
The Commander-in-Chief is hiding more than this from me.

221
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,640
You haven't told me what the immortality medicine is.

222
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,640
There are still many things that the Commander-in-Chief doesn't know.

223
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,640
As long as we have the immortality medicine and the divine bone,

224
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,640
we can achieve what we want and fight against the evil.

225
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,640
Okay.

226
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,640
I don't care how you use those monsters.

227
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,640
I just want to kill my whole clan,

228
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,640
and my parents' old man, Yuan Yang.

229
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,640
Blood debt is a blood debt.

230
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,640
It's past five o'clock. Let's go.

231
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,640
Today's operation is very dangerous.

232
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,640
Everyone must be careful.

233
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,640
The antidote, R3.

234
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,640
What is this?

235
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,640
This is the antidote that the medicine gave us.

236
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,640
Any inhaler that has toxicity can be dissolved.

237
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,640
It can also keep us awake at all times.

238
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,640
So amazing.

239
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,640
Give everyone a copy of the medicine.

240
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,640
General Lin and the others, don't worry.

241
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,640
They are ready to learn.

242
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,640
They will be waiting for you at any time.

243
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,640
Let's go.

244
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,640
We will go to the capital.

245
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
Let's go.

246
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,640
Let's go.

247
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,640
Let's go.

248
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,640
Let's go to the capital.

249
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,640
Let's go to the capital.

250
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,640
Come.

251
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,640
I

252
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,640
will give you a toast.

253
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,640
Thank you, Lord Gongsun,

254
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,640
and everyone in the Crown Prince Camp,

255
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,640
for helping me eliminate the monsters in Zhongli.

256
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
From now on,

257
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,640
I, Zhongli,

258
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,640
will be like the moon,

259
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
and the sun,

260
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,640
and the beasts of the southern mountains,

261
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
and be like the wind.

262
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,640
I, the beast of the southern mountains,

263
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,180
will not be

264
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,640
slain or destroyed.

265
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
I would like to ask you,

266
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,640
why didn't the real Gu Xi come today?

267
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,640
You and the real Gu Xi

268
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,640
are very close.

269
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,640
I just want to say goodbye to the real one.

270
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,640
Please come to me.

271
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,640
No hurry.

272
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,640
You have worked hard.

273
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,640
I am not very grateful.

274
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,640
You are welcome.

275
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,640
I have something to tell you.

276
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
It's okay to tell me.

277
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,640
I have searched the whole house of Xian Xuanji.

278
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,640
I didn't find any clues about her and Ren Pi Gu.

279
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,640
And now,

280
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,640
the only person who knows about it is Grandma Su.

281
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,640
She is nowhere to be found.

282
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
Before,

283
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,640
you promised to help us find her.

284
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
I wonder

285
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,640
what clues you have.

286
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,640
The Su Village has disturbed our Zhongli for a long time.

287
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,640
But the demon corpse has been removed.

288
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,640
You don't need to investigate it anymore.

289
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,640
The world is not a place for the dead.

290
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,640
The people of Zhongli are also the people of Shangshan.

291
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,640
But now, Ren Pi Gu doesn't know where the trace is.

292
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
Grandma Su doesn't know where she is.

293
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,640
How can we solve this matter?

294
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,640
I have worked hard to set up a feast for you.

295
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,640
You really don't want to taste it?

296
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,640
We are like the family.

297
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
We are like the family.

298
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,640
We are like the family.

299
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,640
How can we eat and eat?

300
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,640
This is the smart one.

301
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,640
It's easy to talk to the smart one.

302
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,640
But I never like to deal with the bad guys.

303
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,640
Especially a man like you.

304
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,640
Jiang Wen Hua.

305
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,640
Do you think you can get out of Zhishan Gate safely

306
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,640
if you move your mouth a little today?

307
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,640
Then you think

308
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,640
we dare to step into this gate today.

309
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,640
Don't you have something to prepare?

310
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,640
Come back. Come back.

311
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,640
The old man of the Kun family.

312
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,640
Have you forgotten what your identity is?

313
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,640
The Kun family was loyal to the royal family of Zhongli.

314
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,640
But now you are in danger.

315
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,640
You don't care about the lives of the people.

316
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,640
You are not worthy of being the master of Zhongli.

317
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
Say it.

318
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,640
You are trying to make up for these mistakes.

319
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,640
You are trying to make up for these mistakes.

320
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,640
You are trying to make up for these mistakes.

321
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,640
Say it.

322
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,640
You are trying to make up for these mistakes.

323
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,640
And why do you make human skin bones?

324
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
Ninth Prince.

325
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,640
Ninth Prince, please forgive me.

326
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,640
Ninth Prince, I will say it.

327
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640
I will say everything.

328
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,640
Don't kill me.

329
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,640
Don't kill me.

330
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
I will say everything.

331
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,640
I will say everything.

332
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,640
I will say everything.

333
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,640
What are you laughing at?

334
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,640
I am laughing at the Ninth Prince.

335
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,640
He is smart.

336
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,640
He is smart.

337
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,640
Brother Tianjia, what's wrong with you?

338
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
Brother Cheng, we have taken the antidote.

339
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,640
Why are you poisoned?

340
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,640
Give it to me.

341
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:54,640
Then I have to ask your good brother, the new master.

342
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,640
New Master,

343
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,640
the sachet that my family gave me yesterday,

344
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,640
is it good?

345
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,640
You are lying to me.

346
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,640
I am not loyal to you.

347
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,640
But you are too much.

348
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,640
You want to control the human skin bones of Su Village.

349
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,640
You also want to control the old Su's mother.

350
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
So far,

351
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,640
you are the only ones who can force me.

352
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,640
You have found Su's mother.

353
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,640
Now you are still so stubborn.

354
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,640
Alright.

355
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,640
Today,

356
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,640
I will let you all see

357
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,640
the power of Su's mother.

358
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,640
Don't laugh at me.

359
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,640
Hurry up. Everyone, stand still.

360
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,640
We have taken the antidote.

361
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,640
If we stand still, we will not be easily disturbed.

362
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,640
Xiao Wenhuan,

363
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,640
you can not be disturbed by these scholars.

364
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,640
But some of you may not be able to.

365
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,640
Uncle Lin,

366
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,640
there is something strange about this.

367
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,640
Everyone, withdraw your weapons.

368
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,640
Hurry up. Everyone, move.

369
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,640
Please.

370
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,640
Please bring Lord Gongsun to me.

371
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,640
Master.

372
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,640
Lord Gongsun.

373
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,640
Lord Gongsun.

374
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,640
This is bad.

375
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,640
Let go of my master.

376
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,640
Master.

377
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,640
Lord Gongsun,

378
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,640
you want to summon those Taotie soldiers outside the city, right?

379
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,640
I think those dog-walkers from Shangshan

380
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,640
don't listen to your orders.

381
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,640
Why do you have to take the insult?

382
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,640
If you just want the horse,

383
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,640
you can dethrone me as your hostage.

384
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,640
After all, these are the sons of the dukes.

385
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,640
Why do you have to be enemies with the dukes?

386
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,640
Master.

387
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,640
Shut up.

388
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,640
You are the only one to exchange for all of them.

389
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,640
This deal is not worth it.

390
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,640
Leave the important ones.

391
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,640
Kill the rest.

392
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,640
Kill them all.

393
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,640
Zhong Liyuan,

394
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,640
aren't you afraid that His Majesty will be angry

395
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,640
and punish the dukes if you kill us?

396
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,640
His Majesty?

397
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,640
If you are eliminated,

398
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,640
your next target is His Majesty.

399
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,640
Do it.

400
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,640
Brother Yang.

401
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,640
Hurry up.

402
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,640
Hurry up.

403
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,640
Hurry up.

404
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,640
The exit is ahead.

405
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,640
Bring them up.

406
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,640
What's going on?

407
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,640
What happened?

408
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,640
Let the soldiers go to France.

409
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,640
Jiang Sheng.

410
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,640
The government is under Gui Sheng's control.

411
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,640
It seems that the real purpose of the human body

412
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,640
is to find the sword in the human body.

413
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,640
The human body is the key to the human body.

414
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,640
The key is to find the sword.

415
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,640
The human body is the key to the sword.

416
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,640
But to control these tricks.

417
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,640
No.

418
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,640
I can't let the Kuang's Army

419
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,640
be controlled by the sword.

420
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,640
Wang Sheng.

421
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,640
Uncle Lin.

422
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
Have you forgotten?

423
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,640
You are the ninth deputy general

424
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,640
of the Kuang's Army of Zhongli State.

425
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
Uncle Lin.

426
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,640
You are the first son of General Kun Ze.

427
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,640
The bloodshed is over.

428
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,640
You are the second son of General Lin Yin

429
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,640
who protects the country and the people

430
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,640
and is the real son of Zhongli State.

431
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,640
General Kun.

432
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,640
The first son of the Kuang's Army

433
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,640
will never retreat.

434
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,640
The Kuang's Army can be defeated.

435
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,640
But it can never retreat without a fight.

436
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,640
You can't give up.

437
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,640
I

438
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,640
will never give up.

439
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,640
Kill.

440
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,640
The Kuang's Army is going to fight.

441
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,640
It's the Tongqiong Formation of the Kuang's Army.

442
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,640
It's not good.

443
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,640
Everyone retreat.

444
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,640
Go.

445
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,640
Take the formation.

446
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,640
The Tongqiong Formation of the Kuang's Army.

447
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,640
Take the formation.

448
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,640
Go.

449
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,640
Their weapons

450
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,640
are full of bloodshed.

451
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,640
Bloodshed is a strange star.

452
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,640
As long as we retreat,

453
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,640
the Kuang's Army will be dead.

454
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,640
Uncle Lin.

455
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,640
Go.

456
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,640
Go together.

457
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,640
Uncle Lin.

458
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,640
Go.

459
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,640
Wan Chun.

460
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,640
Wake up.

461
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,640
They will die in vain if you go there.

462
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,640
As long as you are alive,

463
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,640
the Kuang's Army will have hope.

464
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,640
Go.

465
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,640
Go.

466
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,640
Don't turn around.

467
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,640
If you turn around,

468
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,640
you can't go forward.

469
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,640
Uncle Jiang.

470
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,640
We can't let Lin Fuqiang

471
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,640
die in vain.

472
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,640
There are ambushes.

473
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,640
Everyone, be careful.

474
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,640
Protect the villagers.

475
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,640
Don't be a part of it.

476
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,640
Go.

477
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,640
Don't let them run away.

478
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,640
Go after them.

479
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,640
There are more people.

480
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,640
We need to catch up with them.

481
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,640
Go.

482
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,640
Go.

483
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,640
Run.

484
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,640
I'll cover you.

485
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,640
Otherwise, no one can escape.

486
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,640
Junlian.

487
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,640
Go.

488
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,640
Go.

489
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,640
Go.

490
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,640
My Lord.

491
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,640
I'm incompetent.

492
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,640
I only caught Jiang Wenhuan.

493
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,640
The others ran away.

494
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,640
It doesn't matter.

495
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,640
As long as Jiang Wenhuan is in my hands,

496
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,640
the others will come back to die.

497
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,640
Yes.

498
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,640
Go.

499
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,640
Go.

500
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,640
Go.

501
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,640
Go.

502
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,640
Go.

503
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,280
I...

504
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,360
It's me.

505
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,200
Everyone,

506
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,440
get closer to me.

507
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,200
It's not the time to blame yourself.

508
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,120
Brother Jiang is still in Zhong Linyuan's hands.

509
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,840
Stand up for me!

510
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,560
Brother Chong, that's enough.

511
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,240
You can't blame Brother Xinjia for this.

512
00:30:40,240 --> 00:31:07,420
NYIN

513
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,420
Stop.

514
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,780
I already told you earlier.

515
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:29,540
You're useless.

516
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,800
Are you saying this because you're soislful?

517
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,720
After taking revenge, you should learn to jerk off.

518
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,720
I told you.

519
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,320
Your trick is useless.

520
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,600
Why don't you just kill me

521
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,440
and make it worse?

522
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,920
Crown Prince Jiang.

523
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,440
Do you really think I dare not kill you?

524
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,720
You dare not.

525
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,720
You dare not.

526
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,520
Because you want to save my life

527
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,120
and wait for the people of the Crown Prince Camp to come and pick me up.

528
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,520
So that they can be defeated.

529
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,320
You dare not.

530
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
You dare not.

531
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,720
You dare not.

532
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,720
You dare not.

533
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,720
You dare not.

534
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,720
You dare not.

535
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,720
Because you're afraid that Gu Xi will be separated from you

536
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,720
and will leave you forever.

537
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,720
Your loyalty and grudges

538
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,720
are all in your hands.

539
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,720
The tricks you used in the end

540
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,720
are just the tricks of the evil.

541
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,720
Shut up.

542
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,720
What's wrong?

543
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,720
You can't explain it.

544
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,720
You're so stupid.

545
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,720
Crown Prince Jiang is really smart.

546
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,720
But

547
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,720
the person I hate the most in my life

548
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,720
is the one who is smart.

549
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,720
Put him down.

550
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,720
The tricks of these torturers

551
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,720
are all learned from you.

552
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,720
I think you...

553
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,720
and Lord Gongsun

554
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,720
will not be strangers.

555
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,720
Where is my master?

556
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,720
What's wrong with him?

557
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,720
Lord Gongsun

558
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
I will treat him well.

559
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,720
But

560
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,720
I don't know if he is famous for being a beast.

561
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,720
You Shanshan

562
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,720
like to use torturing people to make people surrender.

563
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,720
But I don't.

564
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,720
Because I know

565
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,720
to destroy a person completely

566
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,720
you must catch his weakness.

567
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,720
And then destroy his will completely.

568
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,720
Do you know

569
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,720
I often hear your name mentioned by Gu Xi.

570
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,720
I heard that you wear a mortal bone.

571
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,720
But today

572
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,720
I have to try

573
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,720
to step on your mortal bone.

574
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,720
What does it taste like?

575
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,720
I will definitely leave you a life.

576
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,720
When your good brothers go to the palace

577
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,720
kill them one by one.

578
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,720
Then you will know what it is called

579
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,720
life is not as good as death.

580
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,720
From now on

581
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,720
this is called the next generation.

582
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,720
Have you learned it?

583
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,720
Jiang Shizi

584
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,720
Why are you laughing?

585
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,720
Why are you treating me like this?

586
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,720
I'm afraid

587
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,720
it's not because I'm from Shangshan.

588
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,720
I want to hear

589
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,720
what you think it is.

590
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,720
I'm afraid it's because

591
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,720
