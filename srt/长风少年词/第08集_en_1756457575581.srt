00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,280
We cross paths of love and hate

2
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,880
Nights and dreams that stay in the air

3
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,060
The swords of heaven and earth

4
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,480
Never give up

5
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,240
We just kill each other

6
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,000
until we are no longer

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,200
storied behindgourds

00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,580
We are strong

forever

10
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,200
and a world for us

11
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,760
Using the tide as an example

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,800

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 16

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,480
You're not him.

17
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,320
Who are you?

18
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,320
What...

19
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,480
Are you okay?

20
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
What's going on?

21
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,080
Why is he so agitated?

22
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,680
Yeah.

23
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,480
Enough!

24
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,560
How are you?

25
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,320
Are you okay?

26
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,360
Uncle Luo, are you okay?

27
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,040
I'm fine.

28
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,760
How are you?

29
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,200
He's the only one who has this scar.

30
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,840
How could you have it?

31
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,360
Let's go.

32
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,080
I'll go back and change.

33
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,440
I'll go back to the hospital first.

34
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,720
Thank you.

35
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,240
Why is that scar so deep?

36
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,160
If you want to be exactly like me,

37
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,360
there's still one thing you need to do.

38
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,200
Huh?

39
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,160
Huh?

40
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,080
That scar...

41
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,360
That scar...

42
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:10,860
How is it?

43
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,800
It's so deep.

44
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,440
How come...

45
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,120
is it the scar of your thumb?

46
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,200
Yeah, I'm just so stiff.

47
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,880
Rong Jinzhen.

48
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,160
It is cleaned by the devil.

49
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,520
Just…

50
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,760
What do you want to say?

51
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,200
These days,

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,720
Brother Jiang has been testing me.

53
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,760
Actually,

54
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,520
Brother Jiang is right.

55
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,160
Brother Chong and I

56
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,040
are indeed friends.

57
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,640
But,

58
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,880
there are also grudges and grudges.

59
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,340

Makes

64
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,160
It was years ago

65
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,380
that quadrant justice

66
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,360
was being lost.

67
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,280
I delivered the basic statement

68
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,240
in 852V.

69
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,680
Before on the way,

70
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,000
I heardétais

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
the second Childe of North outside Charles He who

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,040
was brave andidian

73
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,920
I started watch,

74
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,440
He was a famous young hero.

75
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,120
Wasn't he?

76
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,640
So I want to

77
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,440
get hold of him now.

78
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:25,840
Go

79
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,400
Go

80
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,720
Go

81
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,040
Be hasn't the right time

82
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,360
Go!

83
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,360
Such a good fighter.

84
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,760
You're indeed the second childe Chong.

85
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,760
You've been through a lot.

86
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,760
Go!

87
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,160
Tell me.

88
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,760
What trick did you use

89
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,960
to make the son of the Duke of Nanbo

90
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,560
give you the position of the Commander of the Nandu Chamber of Commerce

91
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,960
and ask you to give him the position of the Commander of the Nandu Chamber of Commerce?

92
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,960
I don't know any son of the Duke of Nanbo

93
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,960
and I don't know any member of the Chamber of Commerce.

94
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,960
You're lying.

95
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,960
All these years,

96
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,960
I've been in charge of the Nandu Chamber of Commerce.

97
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
When did you become

98
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960
a despicable son of the Duke of Nanbo?

99
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,960
Shut up.

100
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,960
Fine.

101
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,960
You dare to look at me

102
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,960
with your father's face.

103
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,960
I don't think you're going to suffer.

104
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,960
You really don't know your identity.

105
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
Stop.

106
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,960
Father, look at him.

107
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,560
Father, believe me.

108
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,560
Father.

109
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,560
Do you know why you got beaten up?

110
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
I don't know.

111
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
Let me tell you.

112
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,560
On this Libei grassland,

113
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,560
although your surname is Chong,

114
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,560
you must always remember

115
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,560
that there are things that should be fought.

116
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,560
There are things that shouldn't be fought.

117
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,560
You must always remember

118
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,560
your identity.

119
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,560
Do you understand?

120
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
Do you understand?

121
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,560
I don't know what you need to know

122
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,560
about your identity.

123
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,560
Are you the receptionist of the Nandu Chamber of Commerce?

124
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
You do it yourself.

125
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,560
I'm the son of the Duke of Nanbo, E-Shun.

126
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,560
Greetings, Uncle.

127
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,560
You came from afar

128
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,560
and never met me.

129
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,560
I'm sorry.

130
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,560
Uncle.

131
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
Before the second young master Chong's permission,

132
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
I've assigned him

133
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,560
as the receptionist of the Nandu Chamber of Commerce.

134
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,560
Such a reckless action

135
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,560
seems to be a great loss to Chong.

136
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
I'm sorry.

137
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
I'm sorry.

138
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,560
I'm sorry.

139
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,560
I'm sorry.

140
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,560
I'm sorry.

141
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,560
I'm sorry.

142
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
I'm sorry.

143
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,560
It seems that you have caused a lot of trouble to young master Chong.

144
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,560
But the Duke of Nanbo

145
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,560
has never had a family.

146
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,560
No matter what your identity is

147
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,560
in the grasslands of the north,

148
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,560
the receptionist of the Nandu Chamber of Commerce

149
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,560
is not Chong.

150
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,560
Father.

151
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,560
What do you think, young master Chong?

152
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,560
Father.

153
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,560
I really forget.

154
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
Even if I don't remember my identity,

155
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,560
I'm more reluctant to be

156
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,560
the receptionist of the Nandu Chamber of Commerce.

157
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,560
Because I only need to remember

158
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,560
that I'm Chong Yibiao from the grasslands of the north.

159
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,560
Father, please forgive me.

160
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,560
I'll leave first.

161
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
Father.

162
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,560
I'm sorry.

163
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,560
I'm sorry.

164
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
I'm sorry.

165
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,560
You are indeed a wild beast who does not know the rules.

166
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
What do you want?

167
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,560
Just because I rejected your job in Nandu?

168
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
Do you really think

169
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,560
I only want you to be the receptionist of my Nandu?

170
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,560
I

171
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,560
am

172
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,560
Chong Yibiao.

173
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,560
I'm Chong Yibiao.

174
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,560
I'm Chong Yibiao.

175
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,560
I'm Chong Yibiao.

176
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,560
I'm Chong Yibiao.

177
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,560
I just want to be your friend.

178
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,560
The way you make friends

179
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,560
is really special.

180
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,560
Do you really think I'm the one who helped you?

181
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,560
What else?

182
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,560
Young Master.

183
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560
Are you asleep?

184
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,560
It's so late.

185
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,560
What else do you want?

186
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
I was looking for money secretly.

187
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,560
But I found a thief who was in the capital.

188
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,560
I was worried that it would disturb your rest.

189
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,560
So I came to see.

190
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,560
I didn't see the thief.

191
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,560
But you

192
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,560
are really disturbing my dream.

193
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,560
If you are not at ease,

194
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,560
I'll go to the capital.

195
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,560
I'll go to the capital.

196
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,560
I'll go to the capital.

197
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,560
I'll go to the capital.

198
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,560
I'll go to the capital.

199
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,560
You can enter my tent.

200
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,560
Just search.

201
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,560
No need.

202
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,560
I'm sorry to disturb you.

203
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,560
Go.

204
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,560
I found you were knocked out by someone in the stable.

205
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,560
So I saved you to hide in the tent.

206
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,560
I didn't expect your brother to be still so stubborn.

207
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,560
I'm sorry.

208
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,560
I misunderstood you.

209
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,560
You brothers are really interesting.

210
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,560
Just fight in the day.

211
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,560
At night, you still want to fight.

212
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,560
I tied you up

213
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,560
because I was afraid that you would be impulsive when you woke up.

214
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,560
Thank you for helping me.

215
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,560
But our Chong family's family matter

216
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,560
is not for you to be a stranger.

217
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,560
I didn't expect that

218
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,560
Brother Chong was so tough to me.

219
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,560
But he was so wronged to ask for power

220
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,560
when he faced my father.

221
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,560
What do you mean?

222
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,560
I mean

223
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,560
the second son of the Chong family in the legend

224
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,560
is just a weak and weak man

225
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,560
who can be easily persuaded by you.

226
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,560
It's all about the world.

227
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,560
Right?

228
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,560
The wild wolf in the north of the Li State

229
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,560
should at least have this kind of freedom.

230
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,560
You are a fool.

231
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,560
What do you want to do?

232
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,560
You are blabbering.

233
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,560
You just want to be friends with Brother Chong.

234
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,560
How about it?

235
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,560
Think about it.

236
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,560
How can a son of the South capital be so noble

237
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,560
to be friends with someone

238
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,560
who is not from a famous family like me?

239
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,560
What kind of family are you from?

240
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,560
It seems that the second son of the Chong family

241
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,560
cares more about you than others.

242
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,560
Shut up.

243
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,560
Why are you beating me?

244
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,560
They robbed you of your job today

245
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,560
and hurt you.

246
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,560
What else will they do next?

247
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,560
Do you want to be under that grass?

248
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,560
I heard that the second son of the Chong family

249
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,560
has a good background and a good reputation.

250
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,560
I am very proud of him.

251
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,560
I didn't expect that

252
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,360
You shut up!

253
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,280
I warn you.

254
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,120
Don't you worry about my business.

255
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,160
Stop causing me trouble.

256
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,000
Chongsheng.

257
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,080
You're as capable as me.

258
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,600
Why did you cut your own teeth?

259
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,560
We're different.

260
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,920
The first warrior competition on the grasslands tomorrow.

261
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,520
Are you going to participate?

262
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,960
The first warrior competition on the grasslands tomorrow.

263
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:10,400
Warriors! Warriors! Warriors!

264
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,480
Aren't you curious

265
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,080
who will win the warrior competition?

266
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,240
This year, there's Chongsheng.

267
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,320
What's the winner's suspense?

268
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,600
It's getting late.

269
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,200
It's time to prepare a gift for Chongsheng.

270
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,800
Warriors! Warriors! Warriors!

271
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,800
Warriors! Warriors!

272
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,720
This is the brave man who represents the first warrior.

273
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,920
He's yours.

274
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:58,960
Take it.

275
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,720
Thank you, father.

276
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,000
Get up.

277
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,080
I didn't expect

278
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,920
you to be the first warrior.

279
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,440
But this year, the north is still low.

280
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,760
This year, the north is still low.

281
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,360
Our mansion

282
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,800
will play a leading role.

283
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,760
I'm afraid it's not convenient to invite you to sing and dance.

284
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,360
To celebrate for your brother.

285
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,720
It's okay.

286
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,040
The north is still low.

287
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,120
I'm not that kind of rule in the capital.

288
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,720
You like the name of the first warrior.

289
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,520
How can you not have good wine and meat?

290
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,560
Chongsheng.

291
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,480
Today is your big day.

292
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,320
This gift is from Mr. Di.

293
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,800
Wish you a good life in Libei.

294
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,000
And a good life.

295
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,240
This...

296
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,320
The bronze jade-like sword?

297
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,000
It's a rare treasure.

298
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,440
Right.

299
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,680
Not only in Libei,

300
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,080
but also in the capital.

301
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,280
It's very rare.

302
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:04,920
Right.

303
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,880
Mr. Echun's gift is too precious.

304
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,160
Right.

305
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,200
Brother Chong.

306
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,960
Today's banquet

307
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,440
is for you.

308
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,080
Tonight, everyone can drink as much as they want.

309
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,120
I'll drink all the wine in the capital.

310
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,040
Good.

311
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,840
Good.

312
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,920
How is it, Brother Chong?

313
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,760
Are you satisfied?

314
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,720
I'm not satisfied.

315
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
I'm not satisfied.

316
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,920
I'm not satisfied.

317
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,920
I'm not satisfied.

318
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,920
I'm not satisfied.

319
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,920
I'm not satisfied.

320
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,920
I'm not satisfied.

321
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,920
I'm not satisfied.

322
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,920
I'm not satisfied.

323
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
Are you satisfied?

324
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,520
Are you satisfied?

325
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,320
Stop dancing.

326
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,840
Stop.

327
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,040
Stop.

328
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,000
This is the royal tent of Libei.

329
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,720
This is not a place for you to play.

330
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,200
Get out.

331
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,200
Get out.

332
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,920
Father, look at them.

333
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,600
Biao.

334
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,480
Tell your friends

335
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,000
to leave with their precious gifts.

336
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,480
They are kind.

337
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,800
We, Libei, are grateful.

338
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,920
Father.

339
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,320
These wine and meat songs

340
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,720
are prepared for my son

341
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,120
to celebrate the first warrior of Libei.

342
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,920
Friendship is hard to get.

343
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,520
It's not good for my son to lose interest.

344
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,920
Moreover,

345
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,720
this is not the way to treat guests in Libei.

346
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,720
You...

347
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
Childe Chong.

348
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,320
Since we are friends,

349
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,120
we can drink this wine anywhere.

350
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
Moreover,

351
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,320
Uncle Shi is right.

352
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,920
How can this small royal tent

353
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,320
tolerate our deep friendship?

354
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
Let's go.

355
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
Let's go outside and drink.

356
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
Let's go.

357
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,120
Get out.

358
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,120
Get out.

359
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,520
Brother Chong, look.

360
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,920
After leaving this small royal tent,

361
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,520
the heaven and earth outside are big.

362
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,320
Let's go.

363
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,720
Brother Chong,

364
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,520
you have a good reputation and a good reputation.

365
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,720
Why are you sighing?

366
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,720
So what if I have a good reputation and a good reputation?

367
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,320
In this big Libei,

368
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,920
who is really unhappy for me?

369
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,920
The wine in Libei is really strong.

370
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
What are you doing?

371
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,720
Brother Chong, look.

372
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,320
Such strong wine.

373
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,720
You poured it into the fire.

374
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,920
As long as it's strong,

375
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,320
it can burn the whole grassland to the ground.

376
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,320
In my opinion,

377
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,920
Brother Chong

378
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,120
is the strongest wine

379
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,920
in this Libei grassland.

380
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,120
Even if the whole world

381
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,120
is afraid of you,

382
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,320
you still can't reduce

383
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,520
half of your first warrior's strength.

384
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,320
Because this

385
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,120
is what you got yourself.

386
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,320
No one can change it,

387
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,920
including your brother-in-law.

388
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,520
Besides,

389
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,320
my friend, Eashun,

390
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,320
is the only one

391
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,920
in the world.

392
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
Can't you be worse?

393
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,520
What?

394
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,520
I treat you as a friend.

395
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,720
What do you mean?

396
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,320
Do you admit that

397
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,320
you're my friend?

398
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,720
Just now in the tent,

399
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,320
I forgot to say

400
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,320
that tonight's wine

401
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,920
is only for my friend.

402
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,720
I'm sorry.

403
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
I'm sorry.

404
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,720
Okay.

405
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:43,920
Cheers.

406
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,520
Cheers.

407
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,120
Why?

408
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,720
Why?

409
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,120
You're drunk.

410
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,720
I'm not drunk.

411
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,920
It's your

412
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,120
Ma...

413
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,920
Ma milk wine.

414
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
You're too good.

415
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,520
I didn't expect

416
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,120
that a man like you

417
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,320
would be a street

418
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,320
owner when you're drunk.

419
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,520
You...

420
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,920
Nonsense.

421
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,120
You're...

422
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,720
Sister.

423
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,320
Sister.

424
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,720
Sister.

425
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,720
After that,

426
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,120
I became a close friend with Brother Chong.

427
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,720
We rode horses on the grasslands of the North.

428
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,120
We enjoyed life.

429
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,520
The so-called blue wind is like a cloud.

430
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,320
The superman is free and carefree.

431
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,120
That's all.

432
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,320
Brother Chong, did you see that?

433
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,320
Yes.

434
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
If we keep practicing,

435
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,320
will I be able to beat you?

436
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,720
You're still far from it.

437
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,520
What?

438
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,720
Are you afraid that you'll starve to death

439
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,920
if you don't teach your disciple?

440
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,920
I rode horses on the grasslands of the North.

441
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,920
You're a street owner in the South.

442
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,320
You don't need to compare.

443
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,320
But I still like the North.

444
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,520
It's high and wide.

445
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,920
It's free and carefree.

446
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,920
I didn't expect that the Crown Prince of the South

447
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,920
would like the grasslands of the North.

448
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,720
Although the South is exquisite and prosperous,

449
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,920
it's more like a exquisite bird cage.

450
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,920
It's so breathtaking.

451
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,720
Speaking of which,

452
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,720
the grasslands of the North

453
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,120
are boundless.

454
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,320
Brother Chong, why do you

455
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,520
want to make a place for yourself?

456
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,520
Let's go.

457
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,320
Let's compete again.

458
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,520
Okay.

459
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,320
Let's compete.

460
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,520
Who's afraid of who?

461
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,720
Not long after,

462
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,720
Brother E was back in Nandu.

463
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,720
When we met again,

464
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,720
it was already three years ago.

465
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,120
He hit it!

466
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,320
The eldest son is really good!

467
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,520
Yes!

468
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,720
That's great!

469
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,720
He's so good!

470
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,920
So good!

471
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,920
So good!

472
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,920
Yes!

473
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,920
Yes!

474
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,920
Yes!

475
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,920
Yes!

476
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,920
Yes!

477
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,920
Yes!

478
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,920
Yes!

479
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,920
Yes!

480
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,920
Yes!

481
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,920
Yes!

482
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,520
Look!

483
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,720
This is the sword of Childe Chong.

484
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,720
Childe Chong?

485
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,720
Childe Chong?

486
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,720
Look!

487
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,720
Childe Chong is here!

488
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,720
Look!

489
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
Childe Chong!

490
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,320
Childe Chong is here!

491
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,520
He's so extraordinary!

492
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,920
Look at this dragon phoenix!

493
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,720
He's the most beautiful woman in our grassland.

494
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,320
He's even the best warrior that Sister Xin likes.

495
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,720
Isn't he?

496
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,320
He's so handsome.

497
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,320
Did Childe Chong

498
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,520
shoot an empty arrow just now?

499
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,520
He's so good at it.

500
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,520
Sorry, Brother.

501
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,920
Because you and Brother have everything you are afraid of.

502
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,920
Thank you!

503
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,520
Everyone.

504
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,520
Let's calm down.

505
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,520
Let's calm down.

506
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,520
Let's all calm down!

507
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,520
Let's calm down!

508
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,520
Let's calm down!

509
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,520
Let me see what President 맛있е than the roasted duck dreams.

510
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,520
Young Master

511
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,520
Young Master Chu

512
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,520
Young Master Chu

513
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,520
Young Master Chu

514
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,520
Young Master Chu

515
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,520
Young Master Chu

516
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,520
Why are you back so early today?

517
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,520
Have you finished feeding the horses on the farm?

518
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,520
I wanted to come back earlier to see you set the bait

519
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,520
But I missed it

520
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,520
Here, this black fish is for you

521
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,520
Really?

522
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,520
Thank you, thank you, Young Master Chu

523
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,520
Don't worry, I will practice horse riding in the future

524
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,520
One day, I will set up a fish for you

525
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,520
Okay, I'll be waiting for you

526
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,520
Young Master Chu, your letter has arrived

527
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,520
Brother Chong, the leader, has sent a letter to the family

528
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,520
The night of the southern capital is getting colder

529
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,520
I heard that Brother Chong has been working in the grassland for a long time

530
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,520
He has been respected by the people

531
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,520
He is happy and proud

532
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:45,520
For the past three years, he has been unable to practice the magic and hard training that Brother Chong has been receiving

533
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,520
He has been unable to practice the magic and hard training that Brother Chong has been receiving

534
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,520
For those who are unable to practice the magic and hard training, you must be of good use to me

535
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,520
Okay, I'll be waiting for you

536
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,520
Brother Chong

537
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,520
You must have waited for a long time

538
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,520
Why are you here?

539
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,520
You are the first person to marry a grassland, it's such a big deal

540
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,520
You didn't inform me about it at once

541
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,520
Why are you here so suddenly?

542
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,520
I miss Brother Chong, so I came

543
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,520
Of course, I'm here to visit my future sister-in-law

544
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,520
I heard that you are the most beautiful woman on the grassland

545
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,520
Brother Chong, you are really lucky

546
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,520
It seems that you really like my future sister-in-law

547
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,520
It doesn't matter if I like her or not

548
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,520
It's just a custom of our Libei

549
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,520
To win the first warrior on the grassland, you have to marry the most beautiful woman on the grassland

550
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,520
That's good

551
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,520
Anyway, congratulations on your efforts over the years and finally you have returned

552
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,520
Not only did you establish your prestige on the grassland

553
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,520
You also proved to the world that you are a good man

554
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,520
I also wish you a day to enter the North Marquis Mansion as soon as possible

555
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,520
I hope so

556
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,520
Brother Chong, don't think I'm joking

557
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,520
As long as you and I support each other and work together

558
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,520
In the future, we will become the one-sided feudal lords who will dominate the South and North

559
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,520
Good

560
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,520
Thank you for your father's approval

561
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,520
What are you doing?

562
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,520
Why?

563
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,520
I'm here to visit my future sister-in-law

564
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,520
I know that you are very happy

565
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,520
I just want to ask you to marry me

566
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,520
Thank you

567
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,520
I'm happy

568
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,520
Thank you

569
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,520
Thank you

570
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,520
Thank you

571
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,520
Thank you

572
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,520
Thank you

573
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,520
Thank you

574
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,520
Thank you

575
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,520
Thank you

576
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,520
Thank you

577
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,520
Thank you

578
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,520
Why?

579
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,520
Why not only the Crown Prince's position

580
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,520
Even my own woman

581
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,520
Do I have to give it up?

582
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,520
I don't accept

583
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,520
What do you not accept?

584
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,520
Father said

585
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,520
What kind of person you are

586
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,520
What kind of things you want to do

587
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,520
The first beauty of the North grassland

588
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,520
Is to marry the successor of the North Marquis, the Crown Prince

589
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,520
You have to know that the North Marquis

590
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,520
Will never give a humble son to the successor

591
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,520
I understand what father means

592
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,520
Come back

593
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,520
What attitude is this?

594
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,520
Just now, your eyes

595
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,520
You don't take father in your eyes at all

596
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,520
I think he wants to rebel

597
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,520
Father

598
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,520
Then the marriage of Hai Erhe and Miss Lianxin

599
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,520
Useless

600
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,520
Even a woman can't do it

601
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,520
How can you understand?

602
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,520
From now on

603
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,520
How can I hand over the power of the North to you?

604
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,520
Hai Erhe, I know my mistake

605
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,520
Hai Erhe, I know my mistake

606
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,520
What's the use of just knowing to admit your mistake?

607
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,520
Now your brother is not only growing up

608
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,520
And the power of the South Marquis is behind him

609
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,520
If you don't grow up

610
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,520
I'm afraid I can't protect you

611
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,520
Hai Erhe, I know

612
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,520
I will work harder in the future

613
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,520
I will never let that bastard get the title

614
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,520
I will not live up to father's expectations

615
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,520
Brother Chong

616
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,520
I heard that the North Marquis decided to marry the first beauty of the grassland to the heir

617
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,520
The first beauty of the grassland

618
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,520
Shouldn't she marry the second young master to be the first?

619
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,520
Why are you still talking?

620
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,520
Who said no?

621
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,520
Brother Chong

622
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,520
Do you know where this is?

623
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,520
No

624
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,520
This is where my mother was buried

625
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,520
How could it be?

626
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,520
Yes

627
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,520
As the wife of the North Marquis

628
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,520
The second young master's biological mother

629
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,520
How could she be buried here so hastily?

630
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,520
You should have heard it long ago

631
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,520
I, Chong Yibiao, am the illegitimate son of the North Marquis

632
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,520
My mother is just a lowly prostitute

633
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,520
She was a prostitute

634
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,520
She was a prostitute

635
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,520
She met the long-drunk heir of the North Marquis

636
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,520
The current North Marquis

637
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,520
The heir is ridiculous

638
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,520
The prostitute dared not resist

639
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,520
So she had me

640
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,520
Mother's status and status are not visible to the king

641
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,520
But to leave a bloodline of Chong's family

642
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,520
She can only be buried in the tent

643
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,520
She is worried and afraid all day

644
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,520
Her body is weak

645
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,520
She is weak

646
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,520
In the end

647
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,520
She died in the middle of the night

648
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,520
Blood

649
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,520
Bad news

650
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,520
The wife is bleeding

651
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,520
What wife?

652
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,520
Don't talk nonsense

653
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,520
They could have saved her

654
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,520
But the funny thing is

655
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,520
The whole North Marquis

656
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,520
But no one wants to stay alive

657
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,520
They are even thinking

658
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,520
My mother's death

659
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,520
Buried the mark on the Chong's family

660
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,520
The only one left is me

661
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,520
It reminds the world all the time

662
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,520
On the noble bloodline of the Chong family

663
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,520
The stain of the humble sword is on

664
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,520
Brother Chong

665
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,520
The dead have died

666
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,520
You should let go

667
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,520
I want to let go

668
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,520
But they don't let me go

669
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,520
My existence

670
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,520
I don't want to let go

671
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,520
I want to let go

672
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,520
But they don't let me go

673
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,520
I want to let go

674
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,520
It's a sin

675
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,520
If so

676
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,520
I can't get anything

677
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,520
I'd rather give up everything

678
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,520
I don't want anything

679
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,520
Brother Chong

680
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,520
Brother Chong

681
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,520
I didn't expect your identity

682
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,520
To be so harsh

683
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,520
But

684
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,520
If you really think so

685
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,520
You and Brother Echun have a deep friendship

686
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,520
How did it become like this?

687
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,520
I don't think you two are friends

688
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,520
But enemies

689
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,520
Enemies

690
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,520
He and I are enemies

691
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,520
You really saw the scar on his chest

692
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,520
I see he is badly hurt

693
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,520
No, Jue Lv

694
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,520
How much do you hate people

695
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,520
To hurt people like that

696
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,520
It's a hatred

697
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,520
I don't want to let go

698
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,520
But they don't let me go

699
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,520
I don't want to let go

700
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,520
But they don't let me go

701
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,520
I don't want to let go

702
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,520
But they don't let me go

703
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,520
But they don't let me go

704
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,520
But they don't let me go

705
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,520
But they don't let me go

706
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,520
But they don't let me go

707
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,520
But they don't let me go

708
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,520
But they don't let me go

709
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,520
But they don't let me go

710
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,520
But they don't let me go

711
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,520
But they don't let me go

712
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,520
But they don't let me go

713
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,520
But they don't let me go

714
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,520
But they don't let me go

715
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,520
But they don't let me go

716
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,520
But they don't let me go

717
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,520
But they don't let me go

718
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,520
But they don't let me go

719
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,520
But they don't let me go

720
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,520
But they don't let me go

721
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,520
But they don't let me go

722
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,520
But they don't let me go

723
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,520
But they don't let me go

724
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,520
But they don't let me go

725
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,520
But they don't let me go

726
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,520
But they don't let me go

727
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,520
Who will lobby?

728
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:42,780
Have

729
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,900
Ilaozhan detains his ranks in contemporary technology.

730
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:47,600
I'm afraid the
