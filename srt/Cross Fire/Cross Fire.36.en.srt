1
00:01:07,614 --> 00:01:08,614
Xu Wei.

2
00:01:09,373 --> 00:01:10,373
You finally showed up.

3
00:01:12,094 --> 00:01:13,373
For so many years,

4
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:14,693
You still can't lose.

5
00:01:15,853 --> 00:01:17,414
You will lose.

6
00:01:17,414 --> 00:01:18,694
I'm here to win the championship.

7
00:01:18,694 --> 00:01:19,694
I told you.

8
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,054
Some dreams.

9
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:22,213
Don't do it.

10
00:01:34,253 --> 00:01:35,054
He can't escape.

11
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:35,694
And overtime.

12
00:01:37,253 --> 00:01:41,694
Go Team China.

13
00:01:49,254 --> 00:01:50,254
Isn't that Xu Wei?

14
00:01:50,573 --> 00:01:51,694
Why is he here?

15
00:01:52,334 --> 00:01:53,774
I knew Xiao Bei was injured.

16
00:01:53,774 --> 00:01:55,614
This Xu Wei must have asked someone to do it.

17
00:01:59,573 --> 00:02:00,733
attack

18
00:02:03,453 --> 00:02:04,254
There's one behind the box.

19
00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:04,653
Received

20
00:02:07,653 --> 00:02:09,293
pretty

21
00:02:11,694 --> 00:02:12,733
attack

22
00:02:12,894 --> 00:02:13,334
It fell off.

23
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:13,974
I dropped it.

24
00:02:13,974 --> 00:02:14,614
I dropped it.

25
00:02:14,813 --> 00:02:15,453
Amazing

26
00:02:16,894 --> 00:02:17,774
pretty

27
00:02:20,254 --> 00:02:21,134
Abominable

28
00:02:21,293 --> 00:02:21,974
It can be rushed.

29
00:02:21,974 --> 00:02:22,894
I'm wearing it.

30
00:02:25,774 --> 00:02:26,573
Pull them in.

31
00:02:26,573 --> 00:02:27,573
And one fell off.

32
00:02:28,013 --> 00:02:28,614
Abominable

33
00:02:29,054 --> 00:02:30,213
pretty

34
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:33,933
Three to three overtime is tied again.

35
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:34,974
Oh, my God.

36
00:02:34,974 --> 00:02:36,774
It will go into golden overtime.

37
00:02:36,774 --> 00:02:38,414
It's a battle.

38
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:41,293
We can play in our own way.

39
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:41,694
Do you know

40
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:42,853
The tactic I told you,

41
00:02:42,853 --> 00:02:44,293
You know what?

42
00:02:44,293 --> 00:02:45,534
OK!

43
00:02:46,414 --> 00:02:47,254
Come on.

44
00:02:47,694 --> 00:02:48,653
Come and try again.

45
00:03:17,373 --> 00:03:17,973
King, move back.

46
00:03:17,973 --> 00:03:18,973
I saw Machine coming.

47
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:19,854
I saw it.

48
00:03:23,373 --> 00:03:23,854
I killed one.

49
00:03:23,854 --> 00:03:24,413
pretty

50
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:27,973
I'll move on.

51
00:03:28,813 --> 00:03:29,413
Abominable

52
00:03:31,413 --> 00:03:32,133
Koro

53
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:34,854
I dropped it too.

54
00:03:44,973 --> 00:03:45,854
Kill them!

55
00:03:46,014 --> 00:03:46,973
North is dead.

56
00:03:50,614 --> 00:03:51,973
There's one behind Wang Kai.

57
00:03:52,093 --> 00:03:52,973
I'll support you.

58
00:03:59,454 --> 00:04:00,253
WangKai

59
00:04:13,693 --> 00:04:14,574
Hit North.

60
00:04:14,574 --> 00:04:15,373
Received

61
00:04:23,574 --> 00:04:24,294
Nezha, protection deity

62
00:05:12,974 --> 00:05:13,974
Trust me.

63
00:05:14,294 --> 00:05:15,933
Lu Xiao Bei is dead this time.

64
00:05:23,094 --> 00:05:24,614
I regret the most.

65
00:05:25,174 --> 00:05:26,253
I believe in you.

66
00:05:27,054 --> 00:05:28,054
In my life dictionary,

67
00:05:28,054 --> 00:05:29,373
Without regret,

68
00:05:29,734 --> 00:05:31,133
That's the difference between you and me.

69
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:33,453
Why are you laughing?

70
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:35,054
I laugh at your pity.

71
00:05:37,013 --> 00:05:37,693
I pity you.

72
00:05:38,534 --> 00:05:40,094
I built it myself.

73
00:05:40,094 --> 00:05:40,813
For 11 years,

74
00:05:40,813 --> 00:05:42,373
I won more than 30 championships.

75
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:43,614
The money in my bank card

76
00:05:43,614 --> 00:05:45,133
You've never seen it in your life.

77
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:46,494
I live in a top mansion.

78
00:05:46,494 --> 00:05:48,133
Driving a sports car worth more than 5 million yuan.

79
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:49,133
How can I be pitiful?

80
00:05:50,693 --> 00:05:51,933
To get this.

81
00:05:52,494 --> 00:05:53,893
You killed Lu Xiaonan.

82
00:05:53,893 --> 00:05:54,933
And killed Cao Lei.

83
00:05:55,253 --> 00:05:57,453
Xiao Bei has been in a wheelchair for so many years.

84
00:05:57,453 --> 00:05:58,693
And almost killed me.

85
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:00,893
Your teammates and friends all left you.

86
00:06:01,013 --> 00:06:01,614
Now?

87
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:03,933
You became a wanted criminal.

88
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:05,614
The clubs in China were closed down.

89
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:06,614
You can only escape to a foreign country.

90
00:06:06,614 --> 00:06:08,373
To be a traitor.

91
00:06:08,693 --> 00:06:09,573
Aren't you pitiful?

92
00:06:12,654 --> 00:06:13,933
That's because of you.

93
00:06:14,214 --> 00:06:15,494
I committed a crime

94
00:06:15,494 --> 00:06:17,253
It's a small mistake.

95
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:18,494
You insisted on holding me.

96
00:06:18,734 --> 00:06:19,734
You asked me to turn myself in.

97
00:06:19,734 --> 00:06:21,294
Do you know how hard I am?

98
00:06:21,294 --> 00:06:22,414
I'm in my late twenties.

99
00:06:22,414 --> 00:06:23,494
I'm always fooling around with you.

100
00:06:23,734 --> 00:06:25,174
I can't see any light.

101
00:06:25,174 --> 00:06:26,614
We fell so many times.

102
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:29,054
I just want to take a short step.

103
00:06:29,054 --> 00:06:29,573
Is it wrong?

104
00:06:29,573 --> 00:06:31,614
Don't make excuses for the bad things you did.

105
00:06:32,573 --> 00:06:33,813
No matter how difficult the situation is,

106
00:06:33,854 --> 00:06:35,054
And make the right choice.

107
00:06:35,614 --> 00:06:37,054
Is it so hard to be kind?

108
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:38,614
A kind person.

109
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:40,373
Are the most pitiful.

110
00:06:40,773 --> 00:06:41,813
You made the right choice.

111
00:06:42,414 --> 00:06:43,573
But what will happen to you?

112
00:06:44,054 --> 00:06:46,133
Only the winner is qualified to teach others a lesson.

113
00:06:46,494 --> 00:06:47,813
Victory is the truth.

114
00:06:48,253 --> 00:06:50,054
You've been playing games for so many years.

115
00:06:50,174 --> 00:06:51,693
Don't you understand this?

116
00:06:53,854 --> 00:06:55,253
You don't know anything about games.

117
00:06:56,494 --> 00:06:57,813
Playing games is the most interesting.

118
00:06:58,174 --> 00:06:59,614
After the failure,

119
00:06:59,614 --> 00:07:01,174
And have the chance to continue to play.

120
00:07:03,693 --> 00:07:05,133
You have no chance.

121
00:07:05,734 --> 00:07:07,294
Lu Xiao Bei can't hold on anymore.

122
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:08,933
You lost.

123
00:07:09,453 --> 00:07:11,414
We'll be in the finals.

124
00:07:11,654 --> 00:07:13,734
To win the professional world championship.

125
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,614
And then I will get my work visa.

126
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:19,614
And stay here legally.

127
00:07:20,494 --> 00:07:22,054
It's too early.

128
00:07:22,054 --> 00:07:22,933
It's easy to be hit in the face.

129
00:08:15,614 --> 00:08:16,893
Exwer is on my left wing.

130
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,573
Machine is on my right wing.

131
00:08:19,253 --> 00:08:20,933
Nino, put a gun over my head.

132
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:22,494
if

133
00:08:23,414 --> 00:08:24,294
Hit Nino first.

134
00:08:25,654 --> 00:08:26,933
No, there's not enough bullets.

135
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,054
I'll die before I get the gun.

136
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:28,854
if

137
00:08:29,094 --> 00:08:29,854
Exwer first.

138
00:08:30,534 --> 00:08:31,654
Even if we avoid Machine's bullets,

139
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:33,174
Will still be beaten to death by Nino.

140
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,294
Trapped in this blind spot.

141
00:08:35,453 --> 00:08:36,773
How can we break through?

142
00:08:37,373 --> 00:08:38,734
There's only one chance.

143
00:08:49,893 --> 00:08:50,773
Stop analysing it.

144
00:08:51,253 --> 00:08:52,133
Just use your instinct.

145
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:45,173
He did it.

146
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:46,934
At the last moment,

147
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:47,934
He did it.

148
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:50,013
Under the most unlikely circumstances,

149
00:09:50,013 --> 00:09:50,934
He did it.

150
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:53,773
Yes

151
00:09:54,214 --> 00:09:56,653
North's shot really sealed God.

152
00:09:56,854 --> 00:10:00,094
This is the peak time for great players.

153
00:10:00,653 --> 00:10:02,934
Once again, North has turned the corner in a tight spot.

154
00:10:02,934 --> 00:10:04,133
Success will continue to be the team.

155
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:06,734
Into the final of the Super League.

156
00:11:36,494 --> 00:11:37,494
Xu Wei.

157
00:11:55,013 --> 00:11:55,893
Xu Wei.

158
00:12:03,454 --> 00:12:04,334
Xu Wei.

159
00:13:51,694 --> 00:13:52,974
When did I fall asleep?

160
00:13:52,974 --> 00:13:54,253
And then went to sleep.

161
00:13:54,253 --> 00:13:55,494
You can't call me.

162
00:14:06,253 --> 00:14:06,734
What's up

163
00:14:10,814 --> 00:14:12,574
The police just called.

164
00:14:12,814 --> 00:14:15,454
That Xu Wei had a serious car accident on the road.

165
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:16,413
She was gone on the spot.

166
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:22,694
Brother Feng,

167
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:25,133
He wanted to kill you.

168
00:14:28,253 --> 00:14:29,373
You don't have to regret it.

169
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:32,694
I'm not doing it for Xu Wei today.

170
00:14:40,854 --> 00:14:42,454
If fate can be changed,

171
00:14:45,773 --> 00:14:47,094
I want to go back to the summer of that year.

172
00:14:47,574 --> 00:14:48,454
Get set

173
00:14:49,334 --> 00:14:50,814
For the sake of

174
00:14:51,614 --> 00:14:52,614
To train with me.

175
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:54,974
And took care of me.

176
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:56,614
Support me.

177
00:14:58,013 --> 00:14:59,653
There is no next meal.

178
00:15:01,053 --> 00:15:02,694
But never complained.

179
00:15:42,013 --> 00:15:43,293
Lieutenant

180
00:15:44,373 --> 00:15:45,373
Do you remember?

181
00:15:45,734 --> 00:15:47,013
The day we met,

182
00:15:47,334 --> 00:15:49,053
We played as a team for several days and nights.

183
00:15:49,053 --> 00:15:49,814
I don't remember.

184
00:15:50,413 --> 00:15:52,053
What's the name of your team?

185
00:15:52,173 --> 00:15:52,974
The Coin Team.

186
00:15:54,773 --> 00:15:55,893
Since that day,

187
00:15:56,053 --> 00:15:57,454
We hang out every day.

188
00:16:12,814 --> 00:16:13,814
The game is your life.

189
00:16:14,454 --> 00:16:15,454
And my life.

190
00:16:17,773 --> 00:16:19,734
You threw our dream away.

191
00:16:19,934 --> 00:16:21,013
You are a liar.

192
00:16:22,893 --> 00:16:23,893
The team is gone.

193
00:16:25,373 --> 00:16:26,734
You're not my captain.

194
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:29,053
Don't worry about my business.

195
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,013
If you can tell him,

196
00:16:35,253 --> 00:16:36,614
Lose a game.

197
00:16:37,974 --> 00:16:38,854
Nothing?

198
00:16:40,854 --> 00:16:42,373
Can't win the championship.

199
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:44,734
It's not the end of the world.

200
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,373
Life has a long way to go.

201
00:16:54,094 --> 00:16:55,854
Even if you make a mistake,

202
00:16:56,253 --> 00:16:57,253
It's okay.

203
00:17:01,413 --> 00:17:03,533
Just remember to turn back early.

204
00:17:48,253 --> 00:17:49,253
to speak the truth

205
00:17:49,293 --> 00:17:50,053
Don't you regret it later?

206
00:17:50,174 --> 00:17:51,174
I don't feel regret.

207
00:17:51,813 --> 00:17:52,934
Even if you choose the wrong way,

208
00:17:53,053 --> 00:17:53,934
I want to go on.

209
00:17:54,093 --> 00:17:55,053
What if it fails?

210
00:17:55,813 --> 00:17:57,974
There's no such thing as failure in my life.

211
00:18:37,813 --> 00:18:39,093
Hello, everyone.

212
00:18:39,093 --> 00:18:40,494
Thank you very much.

213
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,093
Recent support and encouragement

214
00:18:42,093 --> 00:18:42,734
What about tomorrow?

215
00:18:42,734 --> 00:18:44,773
We're going to the final.

216
00:18:44,773 --> 00:18:46,773
So we only have half an hour to go.

217
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:51,494
This is the last chance for me to

218
00:18:51,934 --> 00:18:53,093
We'll

219
00:18:55,494 --> 00:18:57,093
Brush it silently.

220
00:18:57,093 --> 00:18:58,894
Leon the Star and Little Gift Killer

221
00:18:59,214 --> 00:18:59,734
hi

222
00:19:00,253 --> 00:19:01,013
Luckyboy

223
00:19:01,013 --> 00:19:03,013
You have three minutes to decide the topic.

224
00:19:03,573 --> 00:19:04,013
hi

225
00:19:05,734 --> 00:19:07,374
I have a question to ask you.

226
00:19:08,253 --> 00:19:09,533
I like a girl.

227
00:19:10,654 --> 00:19:12,214
But I'm too stupid.

228
00:19:12,974 --> 00:19:14,053
And did something wrong.

229
00:19:14,093 --> 00:19:15,494
And hurt her deeply.

230
00:19:16,454 --> 00:19:19,293
I want to know how to get her back.

231
00:19:21,414 --> 00:19:22,613
I'm telling you,

232
00:19:23,013 --> 00:19:24,494
I missed it.

233
00:19:24,853 --> 00:19:25,853
I just missed it.

234
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:28,454
Why do you have to hang yourself from a tree?

235
00:19:29,174 --> 00:19:30,013
Besides,

236
00:19:30,494 --> 00:19:32,013
I don't know your girl.

237
00:19:32,494 --> 00:19:33,494
I really can't help you.

238
00:19:37,533 --> 00:19:38,613
Let me tell you about her.

239
00:19:40,414 --> 00:19:41,253
She is

240
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,013
On the surface,

241
00:19:43,454 --> 00:19:44,214
Covered with thorns.

242
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,134
But you won't admit it.

243
00:19:45,174 --> 00:19:46,134
You should be reasonable.

244
00:19:46,454 --> 00:19:47,773
It can make you choked to death.

245
00:19:47,773 --> 00:19:49,374
And I don't care about burying them.

246
00:19:49,374 --> 00:19:50,734
She doesn't like rainy days.

247
00:19:50,853 --> 00:19:52,093
I don't like crowded subway.

248
00:19:52,414 --> 00:19:53,533
Don't like to eat takeout alone.

249
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:54,654
Drink milk tea without pearls.

250
00:19:55,013 --> 00:19:56,974
Eat instant noodles without vegetable buns.

251
00:19:56,974 --> 00:19:57,573
Correct!

252
00:19:57,813 --> 00:19:59,214
She doesn't like taking photos.

253
00:19:59,214 --> 00:20:00,253
If you don't give her a beauty treatment,

254
00:20:01,013 --> 00:20:02,093
You're so naughty.

255
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,573
Are you out of your mind?

256
00:20:04,573 --> 00:20:05,934
To love such a girl.

257
00:20:09,494 --> 00:20:10,134
Probably

258
00:20:12,053 --> 00:20:12,974
She is

259
00:20:13,773 --> 00:20:14,894
There are a lot of problems.

260
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:18,853
But she is very affectionate.

261
00:20:20,934 --> 00:20:22,654
She remembers every friend's birthday.

262
00:20:23,374 --> 00:20:24,494
When everyone is drunk,

263
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:26,853
She will quietly buy the order.

264
00:20:28,174 --> 00:20:29,174
She's strong.

265
00:20:30,174 --> 00:20:30,934
And independent.

266
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:33,093
Even if she falls,

267
00:20:33,573 --> 00:20:35,053
You can stand up and cry for five minutes.

268
00:20:36,174 --> 00:20:37,214
When I first met her,

269
00:20:37,773 --> 00:20:38,414
Is online.

270
00:20:40,734 --> 00:20:41,734
To be exact,

271
00:20:41,734 --> 00:20:43,013
Should be in the game.

272
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:44,934
She was killed by one shot.

273
00:20:47,654 --> 00:20:48,253
meow

274
00:20:49,773 --> 00:20:50,613
Friends say that

275
00:20:51,654 --> 00:20:52,773
The bullet

276
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:54,734
It hit my heart deeply.

277
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:56,414
I was thinking

278
00:20:56,613 --> 00:20:58,093
How can a person

279
00:20:58,093 --> 00:20:59,494
And fall in love with another person?

280
00:20:59,934 --> 00:21:00,934
But now I understand.

281
00:21:02,414 --> 00:21:03,374
If you love someone,

282
00:21:04,654 --> 00:21:06,613
Maybe the last thing you need is a reason.

283
00:21:10,813 --> 00:21:12,374
Lu Xiao Bei,

284
00:21:16,053 --> 00:21:16,613
to be a sore loser

285
00:21:17,414 --> 00:21:18,174
Change the picture.

286
00:21:18,454 --> 00:21:19,773
I will destroy you on behalf of the moon.

287
00:21:24,053 --> 00:21:26,174
I didn't expect the person who cooked porridge for me in the middle of the night.

288
00:21:26,174 --> 00:21:27,174
It's you.

289
00:22:08,253 --> 00:22:09,414
This classmate,

290
00:22:10,174 --> 00:22:11,494
Your time is almost up.

291
00:22:12,214 --> 00:22:13,734
Do you have anything else to tell me?

292
00:22:17,013 --> 00:22:18,333
I want to say to this girl,

293
00:22:19,174 --> 00:22:21,654
If you don't want to grow up all your life,

294
00:22:21,654 --> 00:22:22,734
Matilda

295
00:22:25,613 --> 00:22:27,253
I'm willing to be your killer forever, Leon.

296
00:22:55,414 --> 00:22:56,053
Leon

297
00:23:02,374 --> 00:23:03,773
To get back to me.

298
00:23:04,093 --> 00:23:05,414
You need to work harder.

299
00:23:28,613 --> 00:23:29,974
Everyone is here.

300
00:23:30,253 --> 00:23:30,853
Brother Feng,

301
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:32,333
Tell me how to play tomorrow.

302
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,293
You can rest tomorrow.

303
00:23:37,934 --> 00:23:39,093
I've been resting for the whole afternoon.

304
00:23:39,093 --> 00:23:40,293
My hands don't hurt so much anymore.

305
00:23:47,414 --> 00:23:47,934
It's impossible.

306
00:23:47,934 --> 00:23:49,293
I'll give you another shot to seal it.

307
00:23:51,934 --> 00:23:53,013
You have a drug allergy.

308
00:23:53,414 --> 00:23:54,293
I don't want to die.

309
00:23:54,974 --> 00:23:56,013
Just a little bit.

310
00:23:56,253 --> 00:23:57,613
At least make it through tomorrow.

311
00:23:58,773 --> 00:24:00,093
Brother Feng, please persuade him.

312
00:24:00,093 --> 00:24:01,613
He was stubborn with me for a long time.

313
00:24:13,374 --> 00:24:15,013
Take the chopsticks.

314
00:24:15,494 --> 00:24:16,694
Hold the sushi.

315
00:24:16,894 --> 00:24:18,134
I'll let you play tomorrow.

316
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,414
What about

317
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:37,694
I have no choice.

318
00:25:46,214 --> 00:25:48,093
After a month of battle,

319
00:25:48,093 --> 00:25:51,333
Today we finally have the final of the Super League.

320
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:54,613
The match was played by WBS team from Brazil.

321
00:25:54,613 --> 00:25:56,734
Against China.

322
00:25:56,734 --> 00:25:58,934
The competition has come to the second big picture.

323
00:25:59,293 --> 00:26:00,974
The two teams are getting more and more fierce.

324
00:26:01,374 --> 00:26:03,374
The Chinese team is slightly behind.

325
00:26:03,573 --> 00:26:04,974
The total score is one-nil.

326
00:26:04,974 --> 00:26:07,853
Brazil's WBS leads by one point

327
00:26:07,853 --> 00:26:10,573
It's dangerous to continue the team.

328
00:26:11,293 --> 00:26:13,093
If they lose the second overall situation,

329
00:26:13,093 --> 00:26:15,053
They won't be the winner.

330
00:26:22,613 --> 00:26:23,253
I dropped it.

331
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:35,414
WBS wins another round.

332
00:26:35,654 --> 00:26:37,374
The score of the second game is three to five.

333
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,894
WBS is stronger than we thought

334
00:26:46,894 --> 00:26:48,134
It feels like we're passive.

335
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:50,853
They play well together.

336
00:26:51,494 --> 00:26:52,813
Is a strong opponent.

337
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:54,934
Chu song

338
00:26:55,654 --> 00:26:56,773
Is Xiao Bei still having a fever?

339
00:26:58,573 --> 00:26:59,573
I took some medicine when I came.

340
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:04,013
I heard he threw up all his breakfast this morning.

341
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:06,414
Can his body still hold up?

342
00:27:07,053 --> 00:27:08,053
Brother Feng said

343
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:09,374
To prepare you.

344
00:27:22,414 --> 00:27:23,333
A is big.

345
00:27:23,773 --> 00:27:24,613
Received

346
00:27:31,293 --> 00:27:32,214
I was killed.

347
00:27:36,934 --> 00:27:38,853
A, I've been there. I fell on A

348
00:27:38,853 --> 00:27:39,613
Call the other side.

349
00:27:40,853 --> 00:27:41,214
I dropped it.

350
00:27:44,053 --> 00:27:45,214
You can't lose any more points.

351
00:28:03,253 --> 00:28:04,853
I dropped the first two.

352
00:28:04,853 --> 00:28:05,894
They're coming around B.

353
00:28:27,253 --> 00:28:28,654
The score is three to six.

354
00:28:28,654 --> 00:28:31,613
Meanwhile WBS is leading by one point.

355
00:28:31,613 --> 00:28:33,093
It's dangerous to continue the team.

356
00:28:34,093 --> 00:28:35,253
Don't you lose?

357
00:28:35,253 --> 00:28:36,613
You can't lose.

358
00:28:45,813 --> 00:28:46,773
Next, I want you

359
00:28:46,773 --> 00:28:47,894
Control the rhythm of the game.

360
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,894
If the opponent is fast, we will be slow.

361
00:28:50,454 --> 00:28:52,494
After losing points on the opposite side, I will definitely re-guard B.

362
00:28:53,934 --> 00:28:54,573
Xiaobei

363
00:28:54,573 --> 00:28:56,253
I want you to sniff out the sniper at point A.

364
00:29:11,654 --> 00:29:12,374
Xiaobei

365
00:29:13,934 --> 00:29:15,214
Did you hear what I said?

366
00:29:16,013 --> 00:29:16,734
Received

367
00:29:27,013 --> 00:29:27,533
umpire

368
00:29:28,013 --> 00:29:28,573
Substitution

369
00:29:30,013 --> 00:29:31,533
Please pause.

370
00:29:32,013 --> 00:29:33,454
Please pause.

371
00:29:37,214 --> 00:29:38,174
Brother Feng called a time-out.

372
00:29:38,734 --> 00:29:39,533
Get ready.

373
00:29:40,093 --> 00:29:41,694
Is Xiao Bei willing to play?

374
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:44,494
Hurry up.

375
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:51,093
Brother Feng,

376
00:29:51,454 --> 00:29:52,573
I can still play.

377
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:55,934
I've told the referee.

378
00:29:56,174 --> 00:29:57,573
Take a rest for Cheng Hao.

379
00:29:57,573 --> 00:29:58,853
The game is not over yet.

380
00:29:58,853 --> 00:29:59,853
I can't go down there.

381
00:30:00,253 --> 00:30:00,813
Xiaobei

382
00:30:01,374 --> 00:30:02,934
I know you care about this game.

383
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,374
You want to be with everyone.

384
00:30:04,374 --> 00:30:06,053
Bring home the world champion trophy.

385
00:30:06,573 --> 00:30:07,853
But look at your hands.

386
00:30:08,013 --> 00:30:09,374
If you continue to fight,

387
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:10,853
Not only this game,

388
00:30:10,853 --> 00:30:12,174
Your career will be over.

389
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:19,053
umpire

390
00:30:19,053 --> 00:30:19,533
Substitution

391
00:30:49,853 --> 00:30:50,773
Fight hard.

392
00:31:18,174 --> 00:31:19,134
In this world,

393
00:31:19,214 --> 00:31:20,533
There's no difficulty.

394
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:22,293
You can stop Lu Xiao Bei.

395
00:31:22,894 --> 00:31:25,533
I want to be like my brother.

396
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:27,613
To be a professional e-sports player.

397
00:31:28,214 --> 00:31:29,454
This is my dream.

398
00:31:30,053 --> 00:31:31,374
In the future?

399
00:31:33,374 --> 00:31:34,414
I will.

400
00:31:35,414 --> 00:31:36,374
I will.

401
00:31:37,533 --> 00:31:40,053
Go on. The team replaced their captain, North.

402
00:31:40,134 --> 00:31:41,053
Change to C You.

403
00:31:41,214 --> 00:31:43,174
This is a helpless and passive substitution.

404
00:31:43,174 --> 00:31:45,494
North is the commander and soul of the team.

405
00:31:45,773 --> 00:31:46,813
After he went off,

406
00:31:47,253 --> 00:31:49,093
Facing the powerful WBS

407
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,813
Can we seize the last chance?

408
00:31:51,813 --> 00:31:52,613
The Jedi fought back.

409
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:54,813
Let's wait and see.

410
00:32:07,734 --> 00:32:08,013
come

411
00:32:08,174 --> 00:32:08,934
Switch to plan B.

412
00:32:08,934 --> 00:32:09,694
Don't be nervous.

413
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:11,573
Play like we practiced before.

414
00:32:11,573 --> 00:32:12,613
I believe I have no problem.

415
00:32:13,613 --> 00:32:14,813
This round begins.

416
00:32:14,894 --> 00:32:16,174
Both sides switch sides.

417
00:32:26,374 --> 00:32:27,053
There are people on the middle road.

418
00:32:27,374 --> 00:32:28,293
Don't panic.

419
00:32:28,374 --> 00:32:29,134
Be careful.

420
00:32:29,813 --> 00:32:30,974
Come on, guys.

421
00:32:34,734 --> 00:32:36,813
Go on, team. Come on.

422
00:32:37,093 --> 00:32:47,654
Go on, team. Come on.

423
00:32:56,494 --> 00:32:57,253
The middle one.

424
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:57,853
see

425
00:33:00,013 --> 00:33:00,813
The middle door is missing.

426
00:33:02,974 --> 00:33:03,694
I killed one.

427
00:33:07,533 --> 00:33:08,253
Get rid of one.

428
00:33:08,414 --> 00:33:09,414
pretty

429
00:33:14,013 --> 00:33:15,013
pretty

430
00:33:20,533 --> 00:33:21,613
After C You came on,

431
00:33:21,613 --> 00:33:23,533
To bring offensive changes to the team.

432
00:33:23,533 --> 00:33:25,253
Created a lot of chances for his teammates.

433
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,654
The last one is fast.

434
00:33:26,773 --> 00:33:27,454
It fell off.

435
00:33:28,494 --> 00:33:29,093
pretty

436
00:33:31,214 --> 00:33:32,214
After winning this point,

437
00:33:32,454 --> 00:33:34,333
Go on. The team has tied the score.

438
00:33:34,773 --> 00:33:36,414
Let's look at the last two points.

439
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,174
Whether they can

440
00:33:38,174 --> 00:33:40,134
The miracle of the semi-finals again.

441
00:33:55,894 --> 00:33:57,454
It's Su Su.

442
00:34:20,174 --> 00:34:23,093
Continue to win.

443
00:34:23,093 --> 00:34:25,414
Come on

444
00:34:37,093 --> 00:34:38,293
Because everyone

445
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:39,773
I think girls can't do it.

446
00:34:39,773 --> 00:34:41,454
That's why I have to do better.

447
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:43,053
That's what I thought.

448
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:44,974
I must run faster than the boys.

449
00:34:45,694 --> 00:34:46,533
But don't forget that

450
00:34:46,934 --> 00:34:48,734
Crossing the fire is a team project.

451
00:34:48,813 --> 00:34:50,654
You want to defeat your opponent.

452
00:34:50,853 --> 00:34:51,613
Not a teammate.

453
00:35:07,173 --> 00:35:08,334
Why go back?

454
00:35:08,374 --> 00:35:09,894
You can stay here and win the championship.

455
00:35:09,934 --> 00:35:11,573
You don't have to live in the shadow of Lu Xiabei.

456
00:35:12,334 --> 00:35:13,533
That's what I thought.

457
00:35:14,573 --> 00:35:15,254
Now,

458
00:35:15,294 --> 00:35:16,774
You don't want to win the championship.

459
00:35:16,774 --> 00:35:18,213
There's something more important.

460
00:35:18,613 --> 00:35:19,494
What is it?

461
00:35:22,213 --> 00:35:23,053
friend

462
00:35:46,133 --> 00:35:46,774
Zha

463
00:35:47,173 --> 00:35:48,693
There's a question I've been wanting to ask you.

464
00:35:48,894 --> 00:35:49,974
When you came to the team,

465
00:35:50,334 --> 00:35:52,053
Is it really for that 20 hours?

466
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:53,294
Of course.

467
00:35:53,294 --> 00:35:53,814
Or what?

468
00:35:53,974 --> 00:35:54,854
to speak the truth

469
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:57,934
Actually, you're not the first person

470
00:35:57,934 --> 00:35:59,334
To form a team with me.

471
00:35:59,774 --> 00:36:00,693
but

472
00:36:01,254 --> 00:36:04,254
You're the first to treat me as a teammate.

473
00:36:05,173 --> 00:36:05,934
Not a monster.

474
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:08,133
Thank you, Captain.

475
00:36:28,294 --> 00:36:28,814
Thank you

476
00:36:29,374 --> 00:36:30,573
You played well today.

477
00:36:34,894 --> 00:36:35,494
I really envy you.

478
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:37,693
There are so many people willing to help you.

479
00:37:31,693 --> 00:37:34,613
Are you sure you want to give the main position to Wang Kai?

480
00:37:34,894 --> 00:37:36,533
And then I regret it.

481
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:38,374
It's not too late to change your mind.

482
00:37:39,294 --> 00:37:40,334
I don't want to lose face.

483
00:37:40,494 --> 00:37:41,133
Besides,

484
00:37:41,173 --> 00:37:43,454
I'm the gold on the bench.

485
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:45,894
It will come in handy at the crucial moment.

486
00:37:46,573 --> 00:37:47,334
I know.

487
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,133
You did it for the team's good.

488
00:37:49,414 --> 00:37:49,934
north

489
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:53,533
We went all the way from Ningjiang to the professional league.

490
00:37:54,414 --> 00:37:56,494
I think we're not just a team.

491
00:37:57,934 --> 00:37:58,854
Is a family.

492
00:38:20,733 --> 00:38:25,494
Go Team China.

493
00:38:27,133 --> 00:38:29,133
As the team continues to lose this point,

494
00:38:29,133 --> 00:38:31,733
The WBS team won the match point.

495
00:38:32,093 --> 00:38:33,854
The team has been pushed

496
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:35,133
The edge of the cliff.

497
00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:36,814
We can see from the faces of the players,

498
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,533
They are under great pressure.

499
00:38:39,173 --> 00:38:40,774
No matter how it ends,

500
00:38:40,934 --> 00:38:43,013
The team went all the way from the small town of Ningjiang.

501
00:38:43,013 --> 00:38:44,414
To the world stage.

502
00:38:44,814 --> 00:38:46,013
They've sent

503
00:38:46,013 --> 00:38:47,414
To prove myself.

504
00:38:47,414 --> 00:38:48,213
it doesn't matter

505
00:38:48,213 --> 00:38:49,693
Believe in yourself, we can win.

506
00:38:50,254 --> 00:38:51,053
There's still time for the game.

507
00:38:51,334 --> 00:38:52,173
Come on.

508
00:38:53,213 --> 00:38:53,774
Come on

509
00:38:54,693 --> 00:38:55,573
Come on

510
00:38:56,254 --> 00:38:56,934
Come on

511
00:38:57,573 --> 00:38:58,254
Come on

512
00:38:58,613 --> 00:38:59,414
Come on

513
00:39:00,093 --> 00:39:01,294
Come on

514
00:39:01,494 --> 00:39:02,653
Come on

515
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:16,934
To the team,

516
00:39:17,414 --> 00:39:20,133
The last point is crucial to them.

517
00:39:21,374 --> 00:39:22,653
This moment

518
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:25,173
The whole Chinese audience is waving the national flag.

519
00:39:25,173 --> 00:39:27,414
To cheer for the team.

520
00:39:27,414 --> 00:39:29,013
Every spectator

521
00:39:29,013 --> 00:39:31,213
Are all cheering for the team.

522
00:39:31,974 --> 00:39:34,334
What a beautiful piece of Chinese red.

523
00:39:45,733 --> 00:39:47,693
The team will win.

524
00:39:47,854 --> 00:39:48,774
Go on.

525
00:39:49,093 --> 00:39:50,294
Come on

526
00:39:50,653 --> 00:39:51,494

529
00:39:53,613 --> 00:39:54,454
He won't lose.

530
00:39:57,934 --> 00:39:59,254
Come on

531
00:39:59,254 --> 00:40:01,374
Come on, we'll win.

532
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:07,693
The score is 2-0.

533
00:41:08,414 --> 00:41:11,414
Congratulations to the WBS team from Brazil.

534
00:41:11,414 --> 00:41:13,454
And become the world champion.

535
00:41:14,334 --> 00:41:16,374
Although captain North was replaced with injury,

536
00:41:17,053 --> 00:41:19,814
But the members of the team who continue to fight are getting stronger.

537
00:41:19,814 --> 00:41:21,454
The players tried their best.

538
00:41:21,613 --> 00:41:23,133
To the audience all over the world.

539
00:41:23,133 --> 00:41:25,254
A wonderful match.

540
00:41:25,653 --> 00:41:27,533
Let's give them the applause.

541
00:41:27,894 --> 00:41:29,294
To the end.

542
00:41:29,533 --> 00:41:31,613
Although the team is defeated,

543
00:41:37,013 --> 00:41:38,213
Ladies and gentlemen,

544
00:41:38,213 --> 00:41:40,213
At this moment,

545
00:41:40,213 --> 00:41:43,093
Cross-fire Premier League title

546
00:41:43,093 --> 00:41:45,733
The winner is from Brazil.

547
00:41:45,733 --> 00:41:48,414
WBS Team

548
00:41:48,414 --> 00:41:49,573
congratulations

549
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:51,854
WBS team from Brazil

550
00:41:51,854 --> 00:41:53,173
Won the award

551
00:41:53,454 --> 00:41:54,173
Xiaobei

552
00:41:54,454 --> 00:41:55,894
We can go back to Ning Jiang.

553
00:41:58,533 --> 00:41:59,573
Sorry, Captain.

554
00:41:59,974 --> 00:42:00,894
I tried my best.

555
00:42:04,494 --> 00:42:05,093
I know that.

556
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,334
You were right to replace me.

557
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,974
Otherwise, the game would be over.

558
00:42:17,613 --> 00:42:18,934
The game is not over.

559
00:42:20,013 --> 00:42:22,374
Although WBS won the championship today,

560
00:42:22,653 --> 00:42:24,053
Doesn't mean that they will keep it.

561
00:42:24,053 --> 00:42:24,374
Yes

562
00:42:24,374 --> 00:42:26,774
This is also a very sacred time.

563
00:42:26,774 --> 00:42:27,294
It's here.

564
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:29,294
We specially invite the Brazilian team

565
00:42:29,294 --> 00:42:31,133
To collect their championship trophy.

566
00:42:31,133 --> 00:42:31,533
to ask sb in

567
00:42:51,733 --> 00:42:53,733
Let them keep the trophy for us.

568
00:42:55,653 --> 00:42:56,213
next year

569
00:43:00,053 --> 00:43:01,374
We'll get it back together next year.

570
00:43:09,414 --> 00:43:09,854
come

571
00:43:14,173 --> 00:43:15,374
We lost today.

572
00:43:15,653 --> 00:43:16,854
I didn't get the championship.

573
00:43:17,374 --> 00:43:18,854
I know you are sad.

574
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:19,693
I'm sorry.

575
00:43:20,814 --> 00:43:21,894
But what you did today

576
00:43:22,013 --> 00:43:23,173
Is more important than winning or losing.

577
00:43:24,053 --> 00:43:24,934
What you did today

578
00:43:24,934 --> 00:43:26,894
Is what everyone wants to do all their lives.

579
00:43:27,294 --> 00:43:28,133
Defeat yourself.

580
00:43:28,774 --> 00:43:30,814
You didn't give up when things were tough.

581
00:43:31,053 --> 00:43:32,374
This is the spirit of the champion.

582
00:43:33,294 --> 00:43:34,774
Although I lost the game today,

583
00:43:35,533 --> 00:43:37,173
But there are many competitions in life.

584
00:43:38,414 --> 00:43:39,854
As long as you have the champion spirit,

585
00:43:40,653 --> 00:43:42,093
We won't be afraid of any challenge.

586
00:43:45,974 --> 00:43:47,533
Do you remember the meaning of our team name?

587
00:43:54,454 --> 00:43:55,334
Go on.

588
00:43:56,294 --> 00:43:57,894
Keep fighting.

589
00:43:58,294 --> 00:43:59,894
Keep fighting.

590
00:44:00,013 --> 00:44:01,613
Keep fighting.

591
00:44:01,934 --> 00:44:03,494
Keep fighting.

592
00:44:17,334 --> 00:44:18,974
It's really bad this time.

593
00:44:18,974 --> 00:44:21,414
She must be scolding us online.

594
00:44:21,414 --> 00:44:23,053
I checked my phone just now.

595
00:44:23,053 --> 00:44:24,533
Four hundred private messages appeared on Weibo.

596
00:44:24,533 --> 00:44:25,814
2,000 comments.

597
00:44:26,093 --> 00:44:27,374
I didn't dare to open it.

598
00:44:27,374 --> 00:44:30,013
I guess they are all cursing and sending blades.

599
00:44:31,213 --> 00:44:33,213
I managed to save more than 20,000 fans for the New Year.

600
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:35,213
I'm sure there's only 300 left.

601
00:44:35,414 --> 00:44:36,494
You're not as miserable as me.

602
00:44:36,494 --> 00:44:38,653
My cow has gone out with my parents.

603
00:44:38,653 --> 00:44:40,133
He said he would be the champion this time.

604
00:44:40,133 --> 00:44:41,934
Come back and get the trophy for him.

605
00:44:41,934 --> 00:44:42,294
Let's go.

606
00:44:50,894 --> 00:44:52,093
400 pieces of private letters.

607
00:44:52,093 --> 00:44:53,374
2,000 comments.

608
00:44:53,374 --> 00:44:55,894
All are scolding and sending blades.

609
00:44:57,173 --> 00:44:58,573
You called me last night.

610
00:44:58,573 --> 00:44:59,653
I didn't dare to answer it.

611
00:45:00,093 --> 00:45:00,854
Qingxue said

612
00:45:01,173 --> 00:45:02,854
And won the championship.

613
00:45:03,053 --> 00:45:04,733
She will be my girlfriend.

614
00:45:04,733 --> 00:45:06,414
It's over now.

615
00:45:07,774 --> 00:45:09,454
Isn't that a continue?

616
00:45:09,454 --> 00:45:10,573
What?

617
00:45:10,573 --> 00:45:12,774
The e-sports team that went out to play games on behalf of the country.

618
00:45:12,774 --> 00:45:13,854
I watched their game.

619
00:45:13,854 --> 00:45:16,053
Lost in WBS.

620
00:45:16,053 --> 00:45:17,533
I think there's a lot of abuse on the Internet.

621
00:45:17,533 --> 00:45:18,454
Was badly beaten.

622
00:45:18,454 --> 00:45:21,294
The team came out of nowhere.

623
00:45:21,294 --> 00:45:23,053
Because of Xiao Feng.

624
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,854
You were great a few years ago.

625
00:45:24,854 --> 00:45:26,814
But it was ten years ago.

626
00:45:27,093 --> 00:45:28,653
They won a narrow victory on TNT.

627
00:45:28,653 --> 00:45:30,053
It's too hard.

628
00:45:30,093 --> 00:45:32,414
I heard that North is amazing.

629
00:45:32,414 --> 00:45:33,894
That's Ning Jiang.

630
00:45:33,894 --> 00:45:35,653
You're still not doing well out.

631
00:45:35,653 --> 00:45:38,414
They promised to win the championship.

632
00:45:38,414 --> 00:45:39,774
She's wilting now.

633
00:45:39,774 --> 00:45:42,093
Brazil is still strong.

634
00:45:42,093 --> 00:45:44,613
It's not so easy to win the championship.

635
00:45:44,613 --> 00:45:46,454
It's good to have made it to Asia.

636
00:45:46,454 --> 00:45:47,613
And the world champion.

637
00:45:47,613 --> 00:45:49,334
Let's go. Stop looking.

638
00:46:39,294 --> 00:46:41,454
Go on, team. Come on.

639
00:46:41,454 --> 00:47:40,934
Come on, let's go.

640
00:48:59,613 --> 00:49:01,854
Asian Esports Championship Final

641
00:49:01,854 --> 00:49:04,974
Team continues to beat Japan TNT again.

642
00:49:04,974 --> 00:49:07,254
With undisputed strength.

643
00:49:07,254 --> 00:49:08,733
After the Battle of Four Figures,

644
00:49:08,733 --> 00:49:11,334
The team went on to score three to one.

645
00:49:11,334 --> 00:49:12,374
Defeated the DZ Team.

646
00:49:12,374 --> 00:49:13,374
And successfully reached the summit.

647
00:49:13,774 --> 00:49:16,093
In consecutive years,

648
00:49:16,093 --> 00:49:18,093
The Super League.

649
00:49:28,494 --> 00:49:30,693
The World Esports Finals.

650
00:49:30,693 --> 00:49:32,854
Continue to sweep the field.

651
00:49:32,854 --> 00:49:33,974
And successfully reached the summit.

652
00:49:33,974 --> 00:49:36,213
And won the fifth Crossfire World Championship.

653
00:49:36,213 --> 00:49:38,213
In the final of the Professional Football League,

654
00:49:38,213 --> 00:49:42,053
Team continues to represent China again on the CFS world stage

655
00:49:42,053 --> 00:49:44,254
They lived up to expectations and returned home in triumph.

656
00:49:44,254 --> 00:49:46,934
Successful revenge WBS from Brazil

657
00:49:48,133 --> 00:49:49,653
Congratulations to the Chinese team.

658
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,053
Congratulations to China.

659
00:50:03,774 --> 00:50:05,053
We have invited

660
00:50:05,053 --> 00:50:07,053
The legendary champion who crossed the line of fire.

661
00:50:07,533 --> 00:50:08,854
In the past three years,

662
00:50:08,854 --> 00:50:10,374
He led China to continue the team.

663
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:11,934
And won eleven consecutive championships.

664
00:50:11,934 --> 00:50:13,173
Carry the world before one

665
00:50:13,374 --> 00:50:14,454
He's guiding the Continuation Team.

666
00:50:14,454 --> 00:50:16,053
For three consecutive years.

667
00:50:16,053 --> 00:50:17,934
The highest stage in the world.

668
00:50:17,934 --> 00:50:19,573
Become the first defending champion in the world.

669
00:50:19,573 --> 00:50:21,693
The winner of the Super League Grand Final.

670
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:23,733
Let's listen to Xiao Feng's experience.

671
00:50:23,934 --> 00:50:26,053
Listen to how he is related to the team.

672
00:50:26,053 --> 00:50:28,613
And become the leader of Chinese e-sports.

673
00:50:40,093 --> 00:50:46,653
Xiao Feng.

674
00:50:48,494 --> 00:50:50,974
In order to prepare for the meeting

675
00:50:50,974 --> 00:50:52,613
World Esports Championship

676
00:50:52,814 --> 00:50:55,733
General Administration of Sport decided to set up a cross-fire national team

677
00:50:55,733 --> 00:50:57,374
This is the first person shooting

678
00:50:57,374 --> 00:50:58,573
The first national team.

679
00:50:58,573 --> 00:51:00,454
Next, Captain Lu Xiabei.

680
00:51:00,533 --> 00:51:01,894
On behalf of the whole team.

681
00:51:07,374 --> 00:51:08,013
Hello, everyone.

682
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,454
I'm the captain of the cross-fire national team.

683
00:51:10,533 --> 00:51:11,173
Lu Xiao Bei,

684
00:51:11,814 --> 00:51:13,374
I think my biggest achievement

685
00:51:14,013 --> 00:51:16,213
Won the first National Challenge.

686
00:51:16,733 --> 00:51:18,454
But there are so many people today.

687
00:51:19,053 --> 00:51:20,093
To listen to my speech.

688
00:51:23,854 --> 00:51:25,294
If it were 14 years ago,

689
00:51:26,454 --> 00:51:27,814
Is unimaginable.

690
00:51:29,454 --> 00:51:31,013
Because there won't be so many people.

691
00:51:31,934 --> 00:51:33,733
To listen to an e-sports player.

692
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:35,814
today

693
00:51:36,173 --> 00:51:37,414
Wearing this uniform,

694
00:51:37,894 --> 00:51:38,854
Represents not only

695
00:51:38,854 --> 00:51:40,774
Thousands of crossfire players across the country

696
00:51:41,093 --> 00:51:42,854
Since 2008,

697
00:51:43,053 --> 00:51:46,013
The dream and sustenance of all professional players.

698
00:51:46,374 --> 00:51:47,334
We can be like this.

699
00:51:47,334 --> 00:51:48,733
Professional training conditions

700
00:51:49,093 --> 00:51:50,974
With the current social attention,

701
00:51:51,213 --> 00:51:52,653
Is the result of their efforts.

702
00:51:55,254 --> 00:51:56,093
Play games.

703
00:51:57,733 --> 00:51:58,854
At that time,

704
00:51:59,053 --> 00:51:59,894
Is a kind of mistake.

705
00:52:01,173 --> 00:52:02,894
Even if you win the national championship,

706
00:52:03,693 --> 00:52:04,613
On the television station.

707
00:52:06,093 --> 00:52:07,573
There will be a lot of people

708
00:52:07,814 --> 00:52:09,213
That you're not doing your job.

709
00:52:09,854 --> 00:52:10,533
once

710
00:52:11,093 --> 00:52:12,454
They're like that, not understood.

711
00:52:13,013 --> 00:52:14,613
Is so obscure.

712
00:52:15,013 --> 00:52:16,733
But they still use their youth

713
00:52:17,374 --> 00:52:18,854
Inherited the spirit of e-sports people.

714
00:52:19,374 --> 00:52:20,294
And blood.

715
00:52:20,613 --> 00:52:21,213
five

716
00:52:22,774 --> 00:52:24,454
This number is very meaningful to me.

717
00:52:25,573 --> 00:52:26,774
I won five championships.

718
00:52:28,733 --> 00:52:30,254
I didn't get a five million bonus.

719
00:52:31,254 --> 00:52:32,494
But my team.

720
00:52:33,814 --> 00:52:35,454
Five times.

721
00:52:35,693 --> 00:52:36,653
And every time,

722
00:52:38,693 --> 00:52:39,934
After the barbecue,

723
00:52:43,173 --> 00:52:44,294
So, until now,

724
00:52:45,173 --> 00:52:46,573
I didn't dare to eat barbecue.

725
00:52:49,653 --> 00:52:51,374
This was the normal state at that time.

726
00:52:53,774 --> 00:52:55,494
How far can a team go?

727
00:52:56,733 --> 00:52:58,334
Mainly in his pocket.

728
00:52:58,334 --> 00:52:59,653
And a few meals.

729
00:53:00,254 --> 00:53:02,254
When you can't even afford instant noodles,

730
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:05,414
Everyone has to go their separate ways.

731
00:53:12,053 --> 00:53:13,013
Someone asked me today,

732
00:53:15,254 --> 00:53:16,613
Where have you been all these years?

733
00:53:18,294 --> 00:53:20,573
Actually, I'm stuck in the game world.

734
00:53:21,133 --> 00:53:22,173
For 11 years.

735
00:53:36,733 --> 00:53:38,053
I know you don't believe it.

736
00:53:40,093 --> 00:53:41,934
Even if I recall it now,

737
00:53:43,133 --> 00:53:44,494
It's like a dream.

738
00:53:45,613 --> 00:53:46,093
not bad

739
00:53:46,733 --> 00:53:47,613
When I woke up,

740
00:53:48,774 --> 00:53:50,133
I saw everything new.

741
00:53:50,774 --> 00:53:51,814
Professional alliance

742
00:53:52,133 --> 00:53:53,133
Top League

743
00:53:54,013 --> 00:53:55,533
And global events.

744
00:53:56,894 --> 00:53:58,814
More and more young people

745
00:53:58,814 --> 00:54:00,934
To join the e-sports industry.

746
00:54:01,133 --> 00:54:01,733
game

747
00:54:02,173 --> 00:54:04,573
It can make people

748
00:54:04,573 --> 00:54:05,774
Experience different pleasures.

749
00:54:06,053 --> 00:54:08,213
When people and people in the virtual world

750
00:54:08,213 --> 00:54:10,374
Cooperation and competition.

751
00:54:10,494 --> 00:54:12,653
The concept of e-sports was born.

752
00:54:13,173 --> 00:54:14,013
From that moment,

753
00:54:14,733 --> 00:54:15,573
Esports

754
00:54:16,053 --> 00:54:18,053
Just like all classic sports.

755
00:54:18,693 --> 00:54:19,533
Full of blood.

756
00:54:20,133 --> 00:54:20,974
And passion.

757
00:54:21,414 --> 00:54:23,414
You will meet a powerful opponent.

758
00:54:23,894 --> 00:54:24,814
I will.

759
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,533
When you meet your teammates,

760
00:54:27,294 --> 00:54:28,254
You even

761
00:54:28,894 --> 00:54:30,653
And get to know your best friend.

762
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:31,814
I have one.

763
00:54:33,294 --> 00:54:34,173
good friend

764
00:54:34,213 --> 00:54:35,774
When we were playing games.

765
00:54:36,934 --> 00:54:38,414
He went from an amateur

766
00:54:39,013 --> 00:54:40,414
To the professional champion.

767
00:54:40,814 --> 00:54:41,613
When we recall together,

768
00:54:41,613 --> 00:54:43,173
We've been through,

769
00:54:44,294 --> 00:54:45,213
We found that

770
00:54:46,053 --> 00:54:47,133
It seems that we have been losing.

771
00:54:49,093 --> 00:54:50,093
Won occasionally.

772
00:54:50,254 --> 00:54:51,173
As a professional,

773
00:54:51,974 --> 00:54:53,934
It's a small chance to win the championship.

774
00:54:54,613 --> 00:54:55,974
But there are still many people

775
00:54:55,974 --> 00:54:57,334
To fight without hesitation.

776
00:54:57,533 --> 00:54:59,013
95% of the players

777
00:54:59,693 --> 00:55:01,414
You can't be a professional player forever.

778
00:55:02,013 --> 00:55:03,934
And 95 percent of the professionals

779
00:55:04,774 --> 00:55:06,733
You'll never be a champion.

780
00:55:08,934 --> 00:55:10,013
But why?

781
00:55:10,454 --> 00:55:13,213
So many young people still love e-sports.

782
00:55:13,334 --> 00:55:14,494
Still wants to be

783
00:55:14,494 --> 00:55:15,693
Five percent.

784
00:55:15,974 --> 00:55:16,934
Because of everything,

785
00:55:17,294 --> 00:55:18,133
Is possible.

786
00:55:18,573 --> 00:55:20,693
There is a chance to overturn the game until the last minute.

787
00:55:20,894 --> 00:55:21,653
life

788
00:55:21,854 --> 00:55:23,334
Is not predestined.

789
00:55:23,334 --> 00:55:24,494
Even if I fail,

790
00:55:24,894 --> 00:55:26,254
Even if we finally find out

791
00:55:26,334 --> 00:55:27,934
We are not the five percent.

792
00:55:28,494 --> 00:55:29,334
So what?

793
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:30,213
today

794
00:55:31,254 --> 00:55:32,774
Our team uniforms are printed with the national flag.

795
00:55:32,894 --> 00:55:34,093
This means that from now on,

796
00:55:34,213 --> 00:55:36,294
Our goal is not only to win the championship,

797
00:55:36,613 --> 00:55:37,613
My teammates and I

798
00:55:37,814 --> 00:55:39,133
Will be united.

799
00:55:39,454 --> 00:55:42,294
To show the world China's e-sports style.

800
00:55:42,814 --> 00:55:44,374
To show the sports spirit of China.

801
00:55:44,613 --> 00:55:45,733
I always believe

802
00:55:46,653 --> 00:55:47,573
And won't admit defeat.

803
00:55:48,173 --> 00:55:49,093
Is youth.

804
00:55:51,334 --> 00:55:52,653
E-sports will be better and better.

805
00:55:53,093 --> 00:55:57,934
good
