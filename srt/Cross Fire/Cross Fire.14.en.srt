1
00:03:25,043 --> 00:03:25,403
too

2
00:03:25,403 --> 00:03:25,923
Blow you up.

3
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:26,603
I

4
00:03:26,603 --> 00:03:27,322
King Size.

5
00:03:27,322 --> 00:03:28,603
Wang Da can't blow it up.

6
00:03:28,962 --> 00:03:30,283
This is like two sets of cards.

7
00:03:30,283 --> 00:03:30,882
The cards are wrong.

8
00:03:30,882 --> 00:03:31,243
Out

9
00:03:31,243 --> 00:03:31,882
Refight.

10
00:03:31,882 --> 00:03:32,403
No way

11
00:03:32,403 --> 00:03:33,162
Take it back and repeat the calculation.

12
00:03:33,962 --> 00:03:35,242
You're here to

13
00:03:35,242 --> 00:03:36,562
The teams of different divisions

14
00:03:36,562 --> 00:03:37,402
I've made the schedule.

15
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:40,043
So many teams are coming to fight with us.

16
00:03:40,043 --> 00:03:41,562
Is the Gangfen Team so proud now?

17
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,562
He didn't come for our dignity.

18
00:03:43,562 --> 00:03:44,762
When I sent the invitation,

19
00:03:44,762 --> 00:03:45,843
I added one.

20
00:03:46,843 --> 00:03:48,523
Whoever wins,

21
00:03:49,282 --> 00:03:50,082
I'll give you a bonus.

22
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:51,442
How could you play like this?

23
00:03:51,442 --> 00:03:52,683
I counted it last time.

24
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:53,803
The cost of our team

25
00:03:53,803 --> 00:03:55,203
If you lose less in training,

26
00:03:55,203 --> 00:03:56,762
The money will be enough to last.

27
00:03:56,762 --> 00:03:57,923
Let's go to Shenzhen to play a game.

28
00:03:57,923 --> 00:03:58,923
There's good news.

29
00:03:58,923 --> 00:04:00,643
The sponsorship money from last time has arrived.

30
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:02,323
Will be transferred to our account in installments.

31
00:04:02,762 --> 00:04:03,283
Really

32
00:04:03,522 --> 00:04:04,883
Although the money is not much,

33
00:04:04,883 --> 00:04:05,363
but

34
00:04:05,363 --> 00:04:06,923
To cover our daily expenses.

35
00:04:06,923 --> 00:04:07,722
And the competition fee,

36
00:04:09,603 --> 00:04:10,323
but

37
00:04:11,122 --> 00:04:11,963
He has a condition.

38
00:04:11,963 --> 00:04:12,963
Don't mention one.

39
00:04:12,963 --> 00:04:13,883
I'll take ten.

40
00:04:13,883 --> 00:04:15,563
I'm afraid you can't accept this condition.

41
00:04:15,563 --> 00:04:16,482
You have to say it first.

42
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:17,842
How can we know if you don't tell us?

43
00:04:17,842 --> 00:04:18,603
Will you accept it?

44
00:04:18,603 --> 00:04:19,402
What's the condition?

45
00:04:23,122 --> 00:04:24,603
What is this?

46
00:04:24,603 --> 00:04:25,323
The condition is

47
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:27,003
Every match,

48
00:04:27,003 --> 00:04:28,283
You have to wear this uniform.

49
00:04:30,163 --> 00:04:30,562
No

50
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:31,762
It's impossible that it can't be worn.

51
00:04:31,762 --> 00:04:32,683
How embarrassing.

52
00:04:33,762 --> 00:04:34,922
You're laughing so hard.

53
00:04:38,603 --> 00:04:40,043
Look at this chef's instant noodles.

54
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:42,642
This is so ugly.

55
00:04:42,922 --> 00:04:43,362
How should I play?

56
00:04:43,362 --> 00:04:44,402
You can't afford it if you don't wear it.

57
00:04:48,762 --> 00:04:49,723
I'm telling you,

58
00:04:50,282 --> 00:04:51,083
The whole Ning River.

59
00:04:51,603 --> 00:04:53,243
Which team is sponsored?

60
00:04:53,963 --> 00:04:54,683
No

61
00:04:55,043 --> 00:04:56,723
All you see are instant noodles.

62
00:04:56,723 --> 00:04:57,683
You know what I saw?

63
00:04:57,683 --> 00:04:58,883
Commercial value

64
00:04:59,762 --> 00:05:00,562
Alright, let's change it.

65
00:05:01,922 --> 00:05:03,002
The Premier League and the Bundesliga.

66
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:03,603
No

67
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:05,603
It's not important.

68
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,163
Their professional clubs

69
00:05:07,443 --> 00:05:09,002
What kind of tires are printed on the uniforms?

70
00:05:09,323 --> 00:05:11,122
Shampoo drink.

71
00:05:11,122 --> 00:05:12,362
Which team has no sponsorship,

72
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:13,362
That's embarrassing.

73
00:05:13,362 --> 00:05:14,243
Put this on.

74
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:15,482
We'll learn

75
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,482
The first step.

76
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:17,362
Smile.

77
00:05:20,523 --> 00:05:21,002
Stop.

78
00:05:21,002 --> 00:05:21,723
I think

79
00:05:22,482 --> 00:05:23,642
The material of our clothes

80
00:05:23,842 --> 00:05:24,762
It's really good.

81
00:05:25,603 --> 00:05:26,922
It's 100 percent cotton.

82
00:05:27,122 --> 00:05:27,603
This is a good move.

83
00:05:27,603 --> 00:05:28,122
quickly

84
00:05:28,122 --> 00:05:29,603
Leader, we have a problem.

85
00:05:29,842 --> 00:05:30,243
From now on,

86
00:05:30,243 --> 00:05:31,683
Let's eat this brand of instant noodles.

87
00:05:31,683 --> 00:05:32,803
Is it free?

88
00:05:32,803 --> 00:05:33,603
I must.

89
00:05:33,762 --> 00:05:34,482
Smile a little more.

90
00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:35,403
I'm alone.

91
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:36,123
You two are also

92
00:05:36,843 --> 00:05:38,123
Funny

93
00:05:39,163 --> 00:05:40,883
If we really win the championship,

94
00:05:41,242 --> 00:05:42,323
Don't mention instant noodles.

95
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:43,883
I'll print the diaper too.

96
00:05:43,883 --> 00:05:44,482
good

97
00:05:44,482 --> 00:05:45,003
That's it.

98
00:05:45,003 --> 00:05:45,843
I printed it all over.

99
00:05:46,642 --> 00:05:47,283
good

100
00:05:47,283 --> 00:05:49,202
One, two, three.

101
00:05:49,202 --> 00:05:49,762
laugh

102
00:06:41,962 --> 00:06:43,323
I'm going to the toilet.

103
00:06:49,762 --> 00:06:50,283
Xiao Feng.

104
00:06:50,563 --> 00:06:52,522
It's okay. The voltage in the old community is unstable.

105
00:06:53,003 --> 00:06:53,642
but

106
00:06:53,642 --> 00:06:55,362
But the transformer downstairs

107
00:06:55,563 --> 00:06:57,403
Are you sure it's about the voltage?

108
00:07:20,323 --> 00:07:21,123
Xiao Feng.

109
00:07:21,682 --> 00:07:22,283
Xiao Feng.

110
00:07:22,482 --> 00:07:22,922
Where are you?

111
00:07:34,003 --> 00:07:35,563
I thought we would never see each other again.

112
00:07:37,003 --> 00:07:37,642
Thank you.

113
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:39,682
Let me see my brother for the last time.

114
00:07:45,403 --> 00:07:46,403
I

115
00:07:46,403 --> 00:07:47,203
Is the only child.

116
00:07:47,203 --> 00:07:48,322
Since I was little,

117
00:07:49,163 --> 00:07:50,523
I have never experienced having brothers and sisters.

118
00:07:50,523 --> 00:07:51,482
What it feels like.

119
00:07:51,802 --> 00:07:52,523
But on that day,

120
00:07:52,802 --> 00:07:54,002
At your brother's funeral,

121
00:07:54,963 --> 00:07:55,843
I feel it.

122
00:08:00,002 --> 00:08:01,002
Everything is over.

123
00:08:02,763 --> 00:08:03,643
To move forward.

124
00:08:05,283 --> 00:08:06,362
We haven't seen each other for so long.

125
00:08:06,843 --> 00:08:07,603
How are you doing?

126
00:08:08,043 --> 00:08:08,843
to speak the truth

127
00:08:09,562 --> 00:08:10,322
It's really not good.

128
00:08:10,682 --> 00:08:12,523
You look so bitter.

129
00:08:12,763 --> 00:08:13,362
What's up

130
00:08:13,843 --> 00:08:15,403
The next opponent is very strong.

131
00:08:15,682 --> 00:08:17,163
If you lose, you'll be eliminated.

132
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,482
Then find a way to win it.

133
00:08:19,763 --> 00:08:21,322
Our team has a short board.

134
00:08:21,723 --> 00:08:23,002
I can't make it up.

135
00:08:25,322 --> 00:08:26,763
You have more experience as a captain than I do.

136
00:08:27,283 --> 00:08:28,322
Is there any good way?

137
00:08:29,002 --> 00:08:29,682
short stave of the barrel

138
00:08:30,482 --> 00:08:31,682
Just change the length.

139
00:08:32,523 --> 00:08:33,643
He's my very good friend.

140
00:08:34,562 --> 00:08:35,603
I don't want to give up on him.

141
00:08:37,242 --> 00:08:38,002
can

142
00:08:38,403 --> 00:08:39,442
You look like a captain.

143
00:08:40,482 --> 00:08:41,682
You don't have to change.

144
00:08:41,682 --> 00:08:43,122
You should use your advantage.

145
00:08:43,403 --> 00:08:44,802
We've been beaten to a pulp.

146
00:08:44,802 --> 00:08:45,603
Where is the advantage?

147
00:08:47,283 --> 00:08:47,802
Look.

148
00:08:47,963 --> 00:08:49,603
Your team's shortcomings are very obvious.

149
00:08:49,882 --> 00:08:51,763
The opponent must be desperate to hit you.

150
00:08:51,763 --> 00:08:52,723
Your advantage is

151
00:08:52,723 --> 00:08:54,362
Do you know how to fight on the opposite side?

152
00:08:54,362 --> 00:08:55,843
But they don't know how to play.

153
00:08:56,643 --> 00:08:57,882
Do you think Yao Ming is good at playing basketball?

154
00:08:58,723 --> 00:08:59,322
Of course.

155
00:08:59,322 --> 00:09:00,442
The former No. 1 center.

156
00:09:00,922 --> 00:09:01,523
that's right

157
00:09:02,002 --> 00:09:03,083
But if a team

158
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,122
Five Yao Ming.

159
00:09:04,403 --> 00:09:05,442
You still lost.

160
00:09:05,682 --> 00:09:06,523
Do you know why?

161
00:09:07,002 --> 00:09:08,163
No matter how powerful Yao Ming is,

162
00:09:08,603 --> 00:09:09,802
Can only be a center.

163
00:09:10,203 --> 00:09:11,403
Can't play shooting guard.

164
00:09:11,682 --> 00:09:13,002
And can't play power forward.

165
00:09:14,882 --> 00:09:16,442
Everyone has a weakness.

166
00:09:16,442 --> 00:09:17,603
But it has its own advantages.

167
00:09:17,922 --> 00:09:18,963
Look at our team Ming.

168
00:09:19,802 --> 00:09:20,963
Your marksmanship is bad.

169
00:09:20,963 --> 00:09:21,922
It stinks worse than his feet.

170
00:09:22,163 --> 00:09:23,682
I practiced for a long time, but he couldn't come out.

171
00:09:23,882 --> 00:09:24,882
But then I found out

172
00:09:25,562 --> 00:09:27,322
Although he is an ordinary marksman,

173
00:09:27,322 --> 00:09:28,523
But he has a good sense of position.

174
00:09:28,882 --> 00:09:30,603
Basically, you just need to meet each other.

175
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:31,963
He can figure out the position of the opponent.

176
00:09:32,643 --> 00:09:33,843
Then I realized

177
00:09:34,322 --> 00:09:36,163
You have to let him do what he's good at.

178
00:09:36,163 --> 00:09:36,922
However

179
00:09:38,283 --> 00:09:39,963
To turn the short board into an advantage,

180
00:09:40,963 --> 00:09:42,322
You need one more key condition.

181
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:43,682
What's the condition?

182
00:09:44,562 --> 00:09:45,682
The tacit understanding between teammates.

183
00:09:47,763 --> 00:09:48,523
Got it?

184
00:09:49,482 --> 00:09:50,403
Got it.

185
00:09:50,682 --> 00:09:51,442
Seven

186
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:52,843
Call me brother.

187
00:09:54,122 --> 00:09:54,843
Lu Xiao Bei,

188
00:09:54,843 --> 00:09:56,242
What kind of master are you?

189
00:09:56,242 --> 00:09:57,362
You have poor taste.

190
00:09:57,643 --> 00:09:58,322
to speak the truth

191
00:09:58,322 --> 00:09:59,403
Besides his mouth,

192
00:09:59,403 --> 00:10:00,482
I really can't see it.

193
00:10:00,482 --> 00:10:01,482
What advantage does he have?

194
00:10:02,122 --> 00:10:02,882
Agree!

195
00:10:04,362 --> 00:10:05,122
One by one.

196
00:10:05,882 --> 00:10:06,843
Shortsighted

197
00:10:06,843 --> 00:10:07,763
Short-sighted

198
00:10:07,963 --> 00:10:08,562
this

199
00:10:08,922 --> 00:10:10,603
Is the difference between you and the master.

200
00:10:10,802 --> 00:10:11,603
Understand?

201
00:10:12,283 --> 00:10:12,963
Xiaobei

202
00:10:13,283 --> 00:10:14,242
What else did the master say?

203
00:10:14,482 --> 00:10:15,403
Tell them about it.

204
00:10:16,763 --> 00:10:18,763
Turn the short board into an advantage.

205
00:10:19,242 --> 00:10:21,163
You need some special training.

206
00:10:21,682 --> 00:10:22,682
Did you hear that?

207
00:10:22,882 --> 00:10:23,763
Did you hear that?

208
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,723
To turn the short board into an advantage,

209
00:10:25,723 --> 00:10:27,122
Special training.

210
00:10:27,482 --> 00:10:29,163
Special training.

211
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:31,242
What special training?

212
00:10:31,242 --> 00:10:32,603
Why is there this?

213
00:10:35,283 --> 00:10:36,203
And ordered takeout.

214
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:37,122
Every day,

215
00:10:44,682 --> 00:10:45,362
Your dad is here.

216
00:10:45,802 --> 00:10:46,322
How to do it?

217
00:10:47,403 --> 00:10:48,043
Open the door

218
00:10:48,322 --> 00:10:49,763
Open the door. Are you crazy?

219
00:10:49,763 --> 00:10:50,843
And took you away?

220
00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:53,083
He not only has to take me away today,

221
00:10:53,682 --> 00:10:54,882
I have to take you all away.

222
00:10:55,203 --> 00:10:56,083
What do you mean?

223
00:10:56,362 --> 00:10:56,963
Open the door.

224
00:10:59,682 --> 00:11:00,163
uncle

225
00:11:00,562 --> 00:11:01,083
You're here.

226
00:11:01,482 --> 00:11:02,242
Please come in.

227
00:11:12,043 --> 00:11:12,723
Don't get me wrong.

228
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,043
I invited my dad today.

229
00:11:14,043 --> 00:11:14,963
To train us.

230
00:11:15,203 --> 00:11:15,802
Come with me.

231
00:11:19,882 --> 00:11:21,562
My dad was a scout for seven years.

232
00:11:22,002 --> 00:11:23,403
I've been on the battlefield and fought in the real battle.

233
00:11:23,403 --> 00:11:24,882
The battlefield is full of emergencies.

234
00:11:24,882 --> 00:11:25,922
The only one I can rely on.

235
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:27,682
Is the comrade by his side.

236
00:11:28,362 --> 00:11:29,203
I see.

237
00:11:29,403 --> 00:11:30,242
Uncle, today,

238
00:11:30,242 --> 00:11:31,562
To be our coach.

239
00:11:32,922 --> 00:11:33,922
What are you waiting for?

240
00:11:34,922 --> 00:11:35,442
uncle

241
00:11:35,682 --> 00:11:36,723
Are we really practicing here?

242
00:11:36,723 --> 00:11:37,603
Yes, right here.

243
00:11:37,843 --> 00:11:38,283
Take a look.

244
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,362
The training subjects today

245
00:11:40,603 --> 00:11:41,643
Is tracking and intercepting.

246
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:42,922
Come here.

247
00:11:44,122 --> 00:11:45,043
speak specifically

248
00:11:45,322 --> 00:11:46,682
The four of you

249
00:11:46,682 --> 00:11:48,682
To intercept me and Cheng Hao.

250
00:11:49,002 --> 00:11:49,603
One hour.

251
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,682
If you can't catch us in an hour,

252
00:11:51,682 --> 00:11:52,562
Even if you lose,

253
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,403
What if we block it?

254
00:11:54,403 --> 00:11:55,802
If you can stop us,

255
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:57,202
See that?

256
00:11:57,202 --> 00:11:58,722
Every restaurant in the building

257
00:11:58,722 --> 00:11:59,562
You can all go in.

258
00:12:00,082 --> 00:12:00,523
My treat.

259
00:12:01,043 --> 00:12:01,962
very good

260
00:12:01,962 --> 00:12:03,682
Uncle, we're never gonna mess with you.

261
00:12:04,082 --> 00:12:05,322
We'll order at most.

262
00:12:05,322 --> 00:12:06,883
Truffle Foie Gras Lobster

263
00:12:06,883 --> 00:12:07,562
dad

264
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,722
Have you thought it through?

265
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,243
Some of us might have eaten it.

266
00:12:10,483 --> 00:12:11,842
You win first, then I'll talk.

267
00:12:14,003 --> 00:12:15,082
The elevator goes up.

268
00:12:15,363 --> 00:12:16,403
Wang Kai, go.

269
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:17,483
S

270
00:12:33,442 --> 00:12:35,082
You must not only learn to lure the enemy,

271
00:12:35,082 --> 00:12:37,523
I have to learn how to pretend.

272
00:12:47,043 --> 00:12:47,483
See that?

273
00:12:47,802 --> 00:12:49,082
It's called inattention.

274
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:50,082
Don't take the investigation seriously.

275
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:50,842
Let's go.

276
00:12:53,123 --> 00:12:54,082
I'm so handsome.

277
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,883
Why am I so handsome?

278
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:57,283
It's time for Haozi to leave.

279
00:13:06,363 --> 00:13:06,922
you

280
00:13:28,043 --> 00:13:29,562
Our whereabouts have been exposed just now.

281
00:13:29,883 --> 00:13:30,883
It's okay, uncle.

282
00:13:30,883 --> 00:13:31,682
You're so amazing.

283
00:13:31,883 --> 00:13:33,243
I'm waiting for you to win.

284
00:13:35,363 --> 00:13:36,802
We are a team now.

285
00:13:37,043 --> 00:13:38,043
We need to cooperate.

286
00:13:38,363 --> 00:13:39,802
If this is a real battlefield,

287
00:13:39,802 --> 00:13:40,682
Your performance just now

288
00:13:40,682 --> 00:13:41,682
Not only killed yourself,

289
00:13:41,682 --> 00:13:42,682
But also your teammates.

290
00:13:42,682 --> 00:13:43,842
It's not that serious, uncle.

291
00:13:43,842 --> 00:13:44,763
Are you scaring me again?

292
00:13:45,602 --> 00:13:46,643
In a team,

293
00:13:47,123 --> 00:13:49,442
You can't pin your hopes on one person.

294
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:51,442
We must give full play to everyone's best characteristics.

295
00:13:51,842 --> 00:13:52,403
remember

296
00:13:52,403 --> 00:13:54,003
Cooperation between teammates and teammates

297
00:13:54,483 --> 00:13:55,643
Is the key to victory.

298
00:13:57,763 --> 00:13:58,363
What's up

299
00:13:58,682 --> 00:13:59,802
Who saw my dad last?

300
00:14:00,842 --> 00:14:01,562
Where is it?

301
00:14:01,763 --> 00:14:02,802
Game Hall.

302
00:14:02,802 --> 00:14:03,562
What do you see?

303
00:14:03,883 --> 00:14:04,483
video game

304
00:14:05,163 --> 00:14:05,602
pretty

305
00:14:06,523 --> 00:14:07,123
What about you?

306
00:14:07,123 --> 00:14:07,802
Menswear department.

307
00:14:07,962 --> 00:14:08,802
What do you see?

308
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:09,842
A naked man.

309
00:14:11,403 --> 00:14:12,322
It's not me.

310
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,883
You two were together just now.

311
00:14:16,043 --> 00:14:17,483
No, I saw your father first.

312
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:18,802
Yes, I heard a sound inside.

313
00:14:18,802 --> 00:14:19,722
Then I thought someone was inside.

314
00:14:19,722 --> 00:14:20,602
Then I went to the fitting room.

315
00:14:20,602 --> 00:14:21,043
Once you open it,

316
00:14:21,043 --> 00:14:22,682
There's a naked man inside.

317
00:14:22,682 --> 00:14:23,523
I'm going out.

318
00:14:23,523 --> 00:14:25,283
After I went out, I didn't have any.

319
00:14:25,283 --> 00:14:25,722
right or wrong?

320
00:14:28,322 --> 00:14:30,202
We're in a mess now.

321
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:31,922
It's not like a team at all.

322
00:14:33,682 --> 00:14:35,123
Whether it's today or the competition,

323
00:14:35,802 --> 00:14:36,682
If you want to win,

324
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,682
We can only trust each other unconditionally.

325
00:14:40,043 --> 00:14:40,922
And cooperate.

326
00:14:41,643 --> 00:14:43,003
Cooperate with each other.

327
00:14:45,483 --> 00:14:46,763
If we can

328
00:14:47,562 --> 00:14:48,922
Make up for your shortcomings.

329
00:14:49,283 --> 00:14:50,283
And learn to cooperate.

330
00:14:51,562 --> 00:14:53,202
We will definitely become a better team.

331
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:56,243
Nezha, protection deity

332
00:14:58,962 --> 00:14:59,722
Play games.

333
00:15:00,163 --> 00:15:01,043
Can you be more careful?

334
00:15:02,003 --> 00:15:02,363
can

335
00:15:02,363 --> 00:15:03,043
S+1

336
00:15:04,043 --> 00:15:05,123
It's a game.

337
00:15:05,643 --> 00:15:06,523
Can you calm down?

338
00:15:07,722 --> 00:15:08,322
Kai

339
00:15:09,682 --> 00:15:10,483
Can you...

340
00:15:11,483 --> 00:15:12,202
Don't be selfish.

341
00:15:12,643 --> 00:15:13,682
How could I?

342
00:15:15,003 --> 00:15:15,322
OK!

343
00:15:18,763 --> 00:15:20,043
I haven't finished yet.

344
00:15:28,883 --> 00:15:29,243
come

345
00:15:31,043 --> 00:15:32,322
These boys have improved.

346
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:33,842
I know.

347
00:15:35,483 --> 00:15:36,442
The mall has four floors.

348
00:15:36,763 --> 00:15:37,802
We each have a floor.

349
00:15:38,243 --> 00:15:39,202
Use this as a walkie-talkie.

350
00:15:39,682 --> 00:15:41,202
Let me know if you have any information.

351
00:15:41,363 --> 00:15:41,842
Let's go.

352
00:15:41,842 --> 00:15:42,483
Set out

353
00:15:48,922 --> 00:15:49,682
Xiao Bei. Little North.

354
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,043
They were found near the Fourth Floor and Third Floor.

355
00:15:52,763 --> 00:15:53,283
Received

356
00:15:53,283 --> 00:15:55,163
You drive them to the third floor from the third escalator.

357
00:15:59,363 --> 00:16:00,763
S + 1, where are you?

358
00:16:01,082 --> 00:16:02,283
I'm on the third floor, the second escalator.

359
00:16:05,322 --> 00:16:07,163
Turn right and enter the safe passage.

360
00:16:07,163 --> 00:16:08,283
They should change the route.

361
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:09,043
To escape from there.

362
00:16:09,043 --> 00:16:10,483
The No.2 Escalator on the third floor

363
00:16:12,283 --> 00:16:13,283
How are you walking?

364
00:16:13,643 --> 00:16:14,802
You broke all my things.

365
00:16:14,802 --> 00:16:15,243
Wearing a suit.

366
00:16:15,243 --> 00:16:16,403
What?

367
00:16:16,403 --> 00:16:17,403
Pick it up.

368
00:16:19,163 --> 00:16:20,003
My stuff.

369
00:16:21,243 --> 00:16:21,883
sorry

370
00:16:22,003 --> 00:16:22,562
sorry

371
00:16:31,483 --> 00:16:33,163
They went down the third floor escalator.

372
00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:35,082
Nezha, protection deity

373
00:16:35,082 --> 00:16:36,523
I'm on the third escalator.

374
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:37,243
Nice

375
00:16:37,243 --> 00:16:38,123
Follow them.

376
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:39,363
Force them to the first floor hall.

377
00:16:39,722 --> 00:16:40,363
Amazing

378
00:16:54,403 --> 00:16:55,202
They're headed for Gate D.

379
00:16:55,202 --> 00:16:55,802
To the D gate.

380
00:17:11,243 --> 00:17:12,442
Nice work, guys.

381
00:17:19,562 --> 00:17:20,163
It's expensive.

382
00:17:21,962 --> 00:17:22,842
Shoulders relaxed.

383
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:24,322
Focus on your waist.

384
00:17:24,322 --> 00:17:25,602
The last five seconds.

385
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:26,842
Don't let me look down on you.

386
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:27,922
come

387
00:17:31,643 --> 00:17:32,442
five

388
00:17:35,202 --> 00:17:36,163
four

389
00:17:41,483 --> 00:17:42,363
Chu song

390
00:17:42,842 --> 00:17:44,003
You're too cruel.

391
00:17:44,403 --> 00:17:45,523
three

392
00:17:47,363 --> 00:17:48,763
two

393
00:17:50,722 --> 00:17:51,363
one

394
00:18:12,403 --> 00:18:13,802
I saw you smile for the first time.

395
00:18:23,043 --> 00:18:23,643
come

396
00:18:24,082 --> 00:18:24,763
get up

397
00:18:25,163 --> 00:18:26,322
I can't afford it.

398
00:18:26,883 --> 00:18:27,562
Hurry up.

399
00:18:44,003 --> 00:18:44,842
Hurry up.

400
00:18:45,682 --> 00:18:46,883
Can't you get up?

401
00:18:47,483 --> 00:18:48,523
Lu Xiao Bei,

402
00:18:50,602 --> 00:18:51,003
Hold on.

403
00:18:51,003 --> 00:18:51,763
It's too heavy.

404
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:52,643
five

405
00:18:53,442 --> 00:18:54,043
four

406
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:01,682
Beer

407
00:19:05,082 --> 00:19:05,842
Where is the longevity noodles?

408
00:19:05,962 --> 00:19:06,962
The captain is preparing.

409
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:08,123
Lieutenant

410
00:19:08,202 --> 00:19:09,003
Where is the longevity noodles?

411
00:19:09,283 --> 00:19:11,163
Here comes the longevity noodles.

412
00:19:17,883 --> 00:19:18,602
This is the longevity noodles.

413
00:19:20,922 --> 00:19:21,523
that

414
00:19:21,523 --> 00:19:22,802
I'll add another egg.

415
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:23,922
No

416
00:19:24,602 --> 00:19:27,523
Other people's noodles are long and straight.

417
00:19:27,722 --> 00:19:29,123
I've been eating it all my life.

418
00:19:29,363 --> 00:19:30,523
Why did you prepare the birthday noodles?

419
00:19:30,523 --> 00:19:31,602
You're turning like this.

420
00:19:31,602 --> 00:19:32,322
how could that be?

421
00:19:32,322 --> 00:19:34,322
It's the first time for Sha and our brothers to celebrate a birthday.

422
00:19:34,322 --> 00:19:35,202
You're just fooling around.

423
00:19:37,003 --> 00:19:37,722
Brother Feng,

424
00:19:38,202 --> 00:19:39,562
You gave me 15 yuan.

425
00:19:40,043 --> 00:19:41,403
Buy beer, instant noodles and peanuts.

426
00:19:41,403 --> 00:19:42,363
There's no money to buy a cake.

427
00:19:43,363 --> 00:19:44,722
Even the birthday buns

428
00:19:44,722 --> 00:19:47,003
I'm the one who paid for the throne from the aunt next door.

429
00:19:51,883 --> 00:19:54,922
I... I think it's good.

430
00:19:54,922 --> 00:19:57,442
It doesn't matter what you eat or drink on your birthday.

431
00:19:57,442 --> 00:19:58,082
What matters is that

432
00:19:58,082 --> 00:19:59,883
We can be happy together.

433
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:04,243
Let's get started.

434
00:20:07,562 --> 00:20:08,202
What are you doing?

435
00:20:10,922 --> 00:20:11,722
thus

436
00:20:12,082 --> 00:20:12,602
Old sand.

437
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:13,682
I'm here today.

438
00:20:13,682 --> 00:20:14,602
It's Christmas again.

439
00:20:14,763 --> 00:20:15,363
Go ahead.

440
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:16,363
What's your wish?

441
00:20:16,562 --> 00:20:18,003
My brothers must have helped you realize it.

442
00:20:18,523 --> 00:20:20,562
I want world peace.

443
00:20:20,562 --> 00:20:22,003
Without poverty.

444
00:20:25,043 --> 00:20:26,003
Not Lao Sha.

445
00:20:26,003 --> 00:20:27,442
That's what the United Nations does.

446
00:20:27,682 --> 00:20:29,082
Tell me, what can we do?

447
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:31,562
That's good.

448
00:20:31,963 --> 00:20:34,322
It doesn't matter what you eat or drink on your birthday.

449
00:20:34,322 --> 00:20:36,082
What matters is that we are together.

450
00:20:36,082 --> 00:20:36,763
Be happy.

451
00:20:37,683 --> 00:20:38,483
No, Lao Sha.

452
00:20:38,483 --> 00:20:39,683
Are you looking down on me?

453
00:20:39,683 --> 00:20:41,122
You must say something today.

454
00:20:41,362 --> 00:20:42,523
Yes, you must say one.

455
00:20:43,203 --> 00:20:44,723
Tell me something I really want to do.

456
00:20:44,763 --> 00:20:45,122
Yes

457
00:20:45,122 --> 00:20:45,602
Yes

458
00:20:46,483 --> 00:20:47,723
I'm too ashamed to say.

459
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:50,642
You have nothing to say.

460
00:20:52,963 --> 00:20:54,642
I want to do it.

461
00:21:05,322 --> 00:21:07,283
This is simple.

462
00:21:08,043 --> 00:21:09,683
Kirin told me

463
00:21:10,043 --> 00:21:11,443
The disco is the most fun.

464
00:21:11,443 --> 00:21:13,483
You can't be a man if you haven't been to the disco.

465
00:21:13,642 --> 00:21:16,003
So I really want to go to the disco.

466
00:21:16,003 --> 00:21:17,162
Can you take me there?

467
00:21:18,322 --> 00:21:19,162
this

468
00:21:19,602 --> 00:21:20,122
no problem

469
00:21:20,523 --> 00:21:21,523
I'll go then.

470
00:21:21,523 --> 00:21:21,963
go

471
00:21:24,203 --> 00:21:25,322
Christmas promotion

472
00:21:26,402 --> 00:21:28,082
Christmas promotion.

473
00:21:28,082 --> 00:21:29,283
Christmas promotion meeting.

474
00:21:29,283 --> 00:21:30,642
Christmas promotion.

475
00:21:30,642 --> 00:21:31,322
Have you seen enough?

476
00:21:33,082 --> 00:21:33,562
Old sand.

477
00:21:34,082 --> 00:21:35,043
We're here to dance.

478
00:21:35,523 --> 00:21:36,362
Not to steal anything.

479
00:21:36,683 --> 00:21:37,602
It's not you.

480
00:21:38,162 --> 00:21:39,162
Why did you bring me here?

481
00:21:40,322 --> 00:21:42,562
A lady brings a man in for free.

482
00:21:43,283 --> 00:21:43,723
Right?

483
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,203
We're here to build a team.

484
00:21:45,322 --> 00:21:46,523
If you want to be a good leader,

485
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:47,203
Arrange it.

486
00:21:48,763 --> 00:21:50,362
But I can only bring one person in.

487
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,443
Come into my room.

488
00:21:54,763 --> 00:21:55,602
Why are you taking my clothes out?

489
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:58,362
Take Lao Sha inside.

490
00:21:58,562 --> 00:21:58,963
hurry up

491
00:22:02,842 --> 00:22:03,122
go in

492
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:03,963
You're in.

493
00:22:03,963 --> 00:22:04,483
can

494
00:22:08,362 --> 00:22:08,683
Lieutenant

495
00:22:15,322 --> 00:22:16,483
That's good.

496
00:22:17,122 --> 00:22:17,882
That's right.

497
00:22:18,043 --> 00:22:18,882
It's good.

498
00:22:19,322 --> 00:22:20,322
But it's a bit slow.

499
00:22:26,523 --> 00:22:27,362
You...

500
00:22:27,523 --> 00:22:28,243
Why are you looking at me?

501
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:43,043
Beauty

502
00:22:43,723 --> 00:22:45,162
Should we surf together?

503
00:22:48,043 --> 00:22:48,763
Beauty

504
00:22:49,283 --> 00:22:50,802
Do you want to leave a phone number?

505
00:22:52,322 --> 00:22:53,283
You have it.

506
00:22:55,723 --> 00:22:56,203
Go away

507
00:23:00,483 --> 00:23:01,122
Old sand.

508
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:02,642
Where is An Lan?

509
00:23:02,802 --> 00:23:04,283
I'm so happy.

510
00:23:05,402 --> 00:23:06,882
Where is An Lan?

511
00:23:07,122 --> 00:23:09,043
I'm the most handsome.

512
00:23:10,802 --> 00:23:11,642
An Lan is here.

513
00:23:11,882 --> 00:23:12,443
Brother Feng,

514
00:23:13,043 --> 00:23:14,963
Get rid of her.

515
00:23:14,963 --> 00:23:16,842
Throw it.

516
00:23:19,122 --> 00:23:20,523
Be careful. Move up.

517
00:23:21,043 --> 00:23:21,723
Go up.

518
00:23:28,402 --> 00:23:29,243
What are you doing?

519
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:31,562
You played Snake in the disco.

520
00:23:31,562 --> 00:23:33,003
You have never seen it before.

521
00:23:33,003 --> 00:23:33,963
There's no one left.

522
00:23:34,882 --> 00:23:35,322
Right?

523
00:23:35,923 --> 00:23:36,723
Relax.

524
00:23:37,203 --> 00:23:38,043
I won't.

525
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:39,122
You can play.

526
00:23:39,122 --> 00:23:40,523
Why not?

527
00:23:41,362 --> 00:23:42,402
What's wrong?

528
00:23:42,402 --> 00:23:43,162
You can play.

529
00:23:43,162 --> 00:23:43,723
play

530
00:23:44,003 --> 00:23:44,723
You have to play.

531
00:23:45,443 --> 00:23:46,483
can't

532
00:23:46,483 --> 00:23:46,882
Al-Amin

533
00:23:47,963 --> 00:23:48,642
Al-Amin

534
00:23:49,882 --> 00:23:51,243
How did you recognize me?

535
00:23:51,243 --> 00:23:53,003
Ming, come here. Let me have a look.

536
00:23:53,322 --> 00:23:54,402
Who gave you the idea?

537
00:23:56,923 --> 00:23:57,842
I think it's pretty.

538
00:23:57,842 --> 00:23:58,683
I like it so much

539
00:24:00,162 --> 00:24:01,362
To dance on the dance floor with us.

540
00:24:01,362 --> 00:24:01,723
I

541
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:03,243
Great.

542
00:24:03,243 --> 00:24:04,362
Have a good time.

543
00:24:04,362 --> 00:24:05,082
Don't bother me.

544
00:24:06,082 --> 00:24:07,162
I'll show you.

545
00:24:08,402 --> 00:24:08,842
AnLuan

546
00:24:09,162 --> 00:24:09,723
I'll show you.

547
00:24:09,723 --> 00:24:11,043
Follow my movements.

548
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:12,763
Yes, it's fine for you to follow the captain.

549
00:24:12,763 --> 00:24:13,322
what are you doing?

550
00:24:13,322 --> 00:24:15,483
Let's go. Get manic.

551
00:24:16,243 --> 00:24:17,003
Let's go.

552
00:24:17,003 --> 00:24:17,562
Jump.

553
00:24:17,683 --> 00:24:18,243
No way

554
00:24:18,243 --> 00:24:19,362
Hurry up. Let's go.

555
00:24:19,763 --> 00:24:20,243
Old sand.

556
00:24:20,243 --> 00:24:24,283
AnLuan

557
00:24:24,283 --> 00:24:25,723
An Lan, I'll teach you.

558
00:24:30,443 --> 00:24:32,283
An Lan, I'll teach you.

559
00:24:32,283 --> 00:24:33,562
It's easy.

560
00:24:33,683 --> 00:24:34,842
Follow me.

561
00:25:22,283 --> 00:25:23,003
man

562
00:25:24,243 --> 00:25:25,162
The block is gone.

563
00:25:25,162 --> 00:25:26,723
Hurry up.

564
00:25:26,723 --> 00:25:26,923
Old sand.

565
00:25:26,923 --> 00:25:27,842
Catch them.

566
00:25:27,842 --> 00:25:28,683
Catch him.

567
00:25:28,683 --> 00:25:29,802
Old Sha has left.

568
00:25:29,802 --> 00:25:31,003
I'm not leaving.

569
00:25:31,003 --> 00:25:32,122
Catch them.

570
00:25:32,642 --> 00:25:34,523
Catch him.

571
00:25:34,523 --> 00:25:35,362
Let's go, Lao Sha.

572
00:25:40,923 --> 00:25:41,763
Stop! Don't run!

573
00:25:42,243 --> 00:25:42,802
stop

574
00:25:42,882 --> 00:25:44,683
Kirin, slow down.

575
00:25:45,362 --> 00:25:46,362
Stop chasing me.

576
00:25:49,322 --> 00:25:51,082
A bunch of Santa Claus are chasing us.

577
00:25:52,043 --> 00:25:53,443
Save a lot of money.

578
00:25:54,243 --> 00:25:55,162
It's so cheap today.

579
00:25:56,642 --> 00:25:57,203
Old sand.

580
00:25:57,602 --> 00:25:58,243
Old sand.

581
00:25:58,483 --> 00:26:00,243
Sorry to you today.

582
00:26:00,322 --> 00:26:01,483
It's your birthday.

583
00:26:01,483 --> 00:26:02,802
There's no cake.

584
00:26:03,003 --> 00:26:03,842
There are no candles.

585
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:04,802
I'm really sorry to you.

586
00:26:04,802 --> 00:26:05,562
Who said there was no cake?

587
00:26:05,562 --> 00:26:06,162
Al-Amin

588
00:26:08,923 --> 00:26:10,923
Birthday cake

589
00:26:11,642 --> 00:26:12,763
Is it edible?

590
00:26:12,763 --> 00:26:14,003
Is it edible?

591
00:26:14,003 --> 00:26:14,683
You can eat it.

592
00:26:15,082 --> 00:26:16,683
There's really a cake.

593
00:26:16,683 --> 00:26:17,882
Although there are no candles,

594
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,082
But I'm really happy.

595
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:21,963
There are candles.

596
00:26:22,243 --> 00:26:23,082
There are candles.

597
00:26:27,443 --> 00:26:27,963
Jumping into the sky.

598
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:28,443
You got it wrong.

599
00:26:28,443 --> 00:26:29,763
Where did Ming get it?

600
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:30,723
He's here.

601
00:26:35,523 --> 00:26:36,203
So touching.

602
00:26:36,203 --> 00:26:37,162
Come on. Plug it in.

603
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:37,923
Thank you, Ming.

604
00:26:37,923 --> 00:26:38,802
Don't you know?

605
00:26:40,362 --> 00:26:42,683
This is such a surprise.

606
00:26:43,483 --> 00:26:45,322
Chang Sha, make a wish.

607
00:26:45,322 --> 00:26:47,122
Make a wish.

608
00:26:47,122 --> 00:26:48,283
It's so touching.

609
00:26:48,283 --> 00:26:49,602
Make a wish.

610
00:26:49,602 --> 00:26:59,203
Happy birthday to you

611
00:26:59,723 --> 00:27:03,162
Happy birthday to you

612
00:27:03,162 --> 00:27:04,483
good

613
00:27:22,923 --> 00:27:23,483
Old sand.

614
00:27:24,283 --> 00:27:26,562
Your wish may be too long.

615
00:27:27,963 --> 00:27:29,443
Are you done?

616
00:27:29,443 --> 00:27:30,283
I haven't promised her.

617
00:27:30,923 --> 00:27:31,683
Stop it.

618
00:27:32,162 --> 00:27:32,963
Stop it.

619
00:27:34,203 --> 00:27:34,802
good

620
00:27:35,523 --> 00:27:36,642
good

621
00:27:38,243 --> 00:27:39,043
My wish.

622
00:27:39,443 --> 00:27:40,203
A group of people

623
00:27:40,203 --> 00:27:41,602
With the one you like.

624
00:27:43,122 --> 00:27:44,443
Doing what I love the most.

625
00:27:47,283 --> 00:27:49,483
I don't want to do what I hate.

626
00:27:51,562 --> 00:27:52,642
This wish

627
00:27:53,043 --> 00:27:55,082
Now it has come true.

628
00:27:56,322 --> 00:27:57,003
Good old sand.

629
00:27:57,483 --> 00:27:58,243
I'm telling you,

630
00:27:58,243 --> 00:27:59,402
I swear that

631
00:27:59,402 --> 00:28:00,683
We will definitely win the national championship.

632
00:28:00,683 --> 00:28:01,243
For the future.

633
00:28:01,243 --> 00:28:02,602
We won't eat instant noodles.

634
00:28:03,122 --> 00:28:03,443
Yes

635
00:28:03,642 --> 00:28:05,082
Not only are we going to win a national championship,

636
00:28:05,203 --> 00:28:06,322
No, take more.

637
00:28:06,322 --> 00:28:07,443
It's not enough to take a few more.

638
00:28:08,043 --> 00:28:09,802
We want to build our own e-sports dynasty.

639
00:28:09,802 --> 00:28:11,562
So that we can live up to our past.

640
00:28:11,562 --> 00:28:12,402
All the efforts

641
00:28:15,003 --> 00:28:17,642
The captain can brag now.

642
00:28:17,642 --> 00:28:18,683
I'm serious.

643
00:28:21,122 --> 00:28:22,322
Ming, go.

644
00:28:22,723 --> 00:28:24,802
Buy me some beer.

645
00:28:25,043 --> 00:28:26,122
Yes, buy some wine.

646
00:28:27,802 --> 00:28:28,523
I have...

647
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:27,203
It's my honor to be here today.

648
00:29:27,203 --> 00:29:29,283
Gravity Club and Aston Martin

649
00:29:29,283 --> 00:29:30,923
Signing ceremony of strategic cooperation

650
00:29:30,923 --> 00:29:32,322
Let's welcome President Xu to speak.

651
00:29:32,443 --> 00:29:34,523
First of all, thank you for coming.

652
00:29:35,283 --> 00:29:37,683
We are honored to be working with Martin

653
00:29:37,683 --> 00:29:39,243
Become a strategic partner.

654
00:29:39,523 --> 00:29:41,362
Gravity Club

655
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,642
To be with Martin.

656
00:29:42,923 --> 00:29:44,523
Not only depends on fate,

657
00:29:44,523 --> 00:29:45,003
What's more,

658
00:29:45,562 --> 00:29:47,923
We share the same idea and spirit.

659
00:29:48,243 --> 00:29:50,082
No matter where you go,

660
00:29:50,523 --> 00:29:52,283
Always be a champion.

661
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,162
Look, this is the place.

662
00:30:01,562 --> 00:30:02,923
They didn't search this place carefully.

663
00:30:03,203 --> 00:30:04,003
Cheng Hao, you'll be in position later.

664
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:05,043
Try to take them here.

665
00:30:05,283 --> 00:30:06,923
Nezha and I are standing behind the door.

666
00:30:06,923 --> 00:30:07,802
Wang Kai S + 1

667
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:13,003
Can you take a picture with us?

668
00:30:13,003 --> 00:30:14,483
Look here. Look.

669
00:30:14,963 --> 00:30:15,443
For a while

670
00:30:15,683 --> 00:30:16,723
Just follow our drill.

671
00:30:16,723 --> 00:30:17,162
Cheng Hao, run.

672
00:30:17,162 --> 00:30:18,483
Big Head, they are betting on today's game.

673
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,162
Do you want to join us?

674
00:30:19,162 --> 00:30:20,802
You're sure to win today.

675
00:30:20,802 --> 00:30:21,523
What else is there to bet on?

676
00:30:21,523 --> 00:30:22,523
It's not a bet.

677
00:30:22,523 --> 00:30:24,322
They mean to continue the team today.

678
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,723
Can't last half an hour.

679
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:26,763
The game will be over.

680
00:30:26,763 --> 00:30:27,763
Half an hour.

681
00:30:27,763 --> 00:30:28,443
It's too fast.

682
00:30:28,882 --> 00:30:29,322
Don't forget that

683
00:30:29,642 --> 00:30:30,723
His team's Cheng Hao

684
00:30:31,043 --> 00:30:31,683
One vegetable.

685
00:30:31,842 --> 00:30:33,082
Will be beaten into a colander today.

686
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:33,723
I see.

687
00:30:33,723 --> 00:30:35,203
Count me in. I'll bet on Langya.

688
00:30:40,723 --> 00:30:41,203
Today, you're

689
00:30:41,203 --> 00:30:42,362
Our secret weapon

690
00:30:43,723 --> 00:30:44,443
Don't be nervous.

691
00:30:46,122 --> 00:30:46,523
Come on.

692
00:30:48,082 --> 00:30:48,602
Go on.

693
00:30:48,882 --> 00:30:49,723
And work hard.

694
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:51,882
Got it

695
00:30:52,203 --> 00:30:52,802
Prepare for the competition.

696
00:31:10,523 --> 00:31:11,882
Study it carefully.

697
00:31:11,882 --> 00:31:12,963
Continue the team's tactics.

698
00:31:21,122 --> 00:31:22,362
Cheng Hao, it's your turn.

699
00:31:38,243 --> 00:31:40,162
What's the strategy of the team?

700
00:31:40,162 --> 00:31:42,122
Is Cheng Hao running away?

701
00:31:42,802 --> 00:31:44,362
You've learned a lot today.

702
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,003
This is not a tactic.

703
00:31:55,322 --> 00:31:55,802
And ran away.

704
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:56,963
Press on and kill them.

705
00:31:57,483 --> 00:31:57,963
good

706
00:32:03,483 --> 00:32:05,203
Captain, that boy is running away again.

707
00:32:05,642 --> 00:32:06,642
He's not the only one.

708
00:32:06,882 --> 00:32:08,763
The whole team is retreating.

709
00:32:09,003 --> 00:32:09,523
I'll press it.

710
00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:10,203
good

711
00:32:11,243 --> 00:32:12,923
Why did the team run away again?

712
00:32:12,923 --> 00:32:14,203
I've never seen him play before.

713
00:32:14,203 --> 00:32:15,043
There's this tactic.

714
00:32:15,043 --> 00:32:16,003
With your tail between your legs.

715
00:32:16,963 --> 00:32:17,763
With your tail between your legs.

716
00:32:19,162 --> 00:32:20,642
This isn't running away.

717
00:32:20,923 --> 00:32:21,923
President Xu.

718
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:24,362
By running,

719
00:32:24,362 --> 00:32:25,642
Read the opponent's tactics.

720
00:32:26,283 --> 00:32:27,642
And find a way to strike.

721
00:32:28,043 --> 00:32:28,842
Little KA.

722
00:32:29,642 --> 00:32:30,122
Come here at A.

723
00:32:58,003 --> 00:32:58,562
Hello

724
00:33:01,043 --> 00:33:02,443
Nezha, protection deity

725
00:33:07,283 --> 00:33:07,842
pretty

726
00:33:10,763 --> 00:33:12,443
Brother Zha pulled me out.

727
00:33:12,642 --> 00:33:13,082
fast

728
00:33:19,162 --> 00:33:20,402
Hao, do that.

729
00:33:22,802 --> 00:33:23,882
Hold on.

730
00:33:26,122 --> 00:33:28,162
Go on. The team is running to Gate A.

731
00:33:28,322 --> 00:33:28,963
It doesn't make sense.

732
00:33:29,802 --> 00:33:30,602
We can see that

733
00:33:30,763 --> 00:33:31,443
Go on.

734
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:32,802
Now I'm dragging the rhythm patiently.

735
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,443
The pressure has obviously come to Langya.

736
00:33:38,243 --> 00:33:39,602
The position can be reached.

737
00:33:40,362 --> 00:33:42,003
You can hit it directly.

738
00:33:42,003 --> 00:33:43,562
The opponent at the entrance of A Alley.

739
00:33:43,802 --> 00:33:44,963
But most people can't go there.

740
00:33:48,243 --> 00:33:49,003
Be careful.

741
00:33:49,003 --> 00:33:49,802
Watch your back.

742
00:33:52,562 --> 00:33:53,842
Another bold outcrop of Langya.

743
00:33:53,842 --> 00:33:54,642
Was killed instantly.

744
00:33:54,642 --> 00:33:55,162
on

745
00:33:56,483 --> 00:33:57,523
Langya lost control of B Road.

746
00:33:57,683 --> 00:33:58,283
backward

747
00:33:58,283 --> 00:33:58,723
He's here.

748
00:33:58,723 --> 00:33:59,963
The team is coming.

749
00:33:59,963 --> 00:34:01,523
Oh, my God. That was a good double.

750
00:34:03,963 --> 00:34:04,683
pretty

751
00:34:06,203 --> 00:34:07,523
Young K, go down.

752
00:34:07,763 --> 00:34:08,203
At zero,

753
00:34:08,642 --> 00:34:09,203
down

754
00:34:13,842 --> 00:34:14,723
Don't let me down.

755
00:34:33,963 --> 00:34:34,402
Good for you.

756
00:34:34,842 --> 00:34:35,162
Continue

757
00:34:36,122 --> 00:34:37,402
Zero Marksmanship is good.

758
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:38,642
Come up and help Langya.

759
00:34:38,642 --> 00:34:39,763
To stabilize the position.

760
00:34:40,443 --> 00:34:41,763
They changed the zero.

761
00:34:43,802 --> 00:34:44,483
I'll handle him.

762
00:34:44,923 --> 00:34:45,562
Forget it.

763
00:34:45,602 --> 00:34:46,483
His gun is too powerful.

764
00:34:46,483 --> 00:34:47,283
We can't fight it.

765
00:34:47,362 --> 00:34:48,003
To avoid him.

766
00:34:48,882 --> 00:34:49,402
No way

767
00:34:50,162 --> 00:34:50,882
Next round.

768
00:34:51,162 --> 00:34:51,963
Let's concentrate our fire.

769
00:34:52,203 --> 00:34:53,203
Focus on zero.

770
00:34:53,402 --> 00:34:54,283
Are you crazy?

771
00:34:54,283 --> 00:34:55,683
His hands are burning hot.

772
00:34:55,683 --> 00:34:57,003
Don't you want to die?

773
00:34:57,003 --> 00:34:57,802
Because of this,

774
00:34:58,203 --> 00:34:58,842
That's why we have to

775
00:34:58,842 --> 00:34:59,842
Feed him all the bullets.

776
00:35:00,243 --> 00:35:01,122
To get rid of his touch.

777
00:35:02,283 --> 00:35:02,802
Nezha, protection deity

778
00:35:07,963 --> 00:35:09,923
Are you going crazy?

779
00:35:10,162 --> 00:35:11,362
The spy is so strong.

780
00:35:11,683 --> 00:35:12,802
They even sent a group to die.

781
00:35:13,162 --> 00:35:14,003
Isn't this suicide?

782
00:35:14,642 --> 00:35:16,443
The idea of continuing the team is right.

783
00:35:16,723 --> 00:35:17,723
Human beings are not machines.

784
00:35:18,443 --> 00:35:19,523
It feels so good.

785
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:21,203
If the frequency is too high,

786
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:22,162
There will be mistakes.

787
00:35:22,882 --> 00:35:23,842
Especially snipers.

788
00:35:24,203 --> 00:35:25,443
Once you feel it,

789
00:35:25,683 --> 00:35:27,003
The strength of Langya,

790
00:35:27,523 --> 00:35:29,082
Will become their death point.

791
00:35:35,882 --> 00:35:36,203
Be careful

792
00:35:54,963 --> 00:35:55,602
Next round.

793
00:35:56,723 --> 00:35:58,003
You are swimming behind me.

794
00:36:00,483 --> 00:36:01,402
And swim.

795
00:36:01,602 --> 00:36:02,362
Are you kidding me?

796
00:36:02,683 --> 00:36:03,963
We have lost three points in a row.

797
00:36:04,402 --> 00:36:05,683
I will kill them all.

798
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:06,642
Keep it steady.

799
00:36:06,842 --> 00:36:07,523
Don't take any risks.

800
00:36:09,243 --> 00:36:10,283
Don't you believe me?

801
00:36:10,923 --> 00:36:12,763
Are you the captain or am I the captain?

802
00:36:13,243 --> 00:36:14,082
And swim.

803
00:36:17,162 --> 00:36:17,642
Continue

804
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:18,562
Now?

805
00:36:18,562 --> 00:36:19,683
Go on, the team has already

806
00:36:19,683 --> 00:36:20,642
To two points.

807
00:36:21,003 --> 00:36:21,963
Whether or not

808
00:36:21,963 --> 00:36:23,723
The biggest upset of Ning Jiang Team.

809
00:36:27,003 --> 00:36:27,882
Hold on. Don't panic.

810
00:36:31,642 --> 00:36:32,562
Captain, behind you.

811
00:36:33,763 --> 00:36:35,243
There's only zero left for Langya.

812
00:36:37,923 --> 00:36:39,523
Xiao Bei seems to have found the zero point.

813
00:36:47,362 --> 00:36:48,402
Zero is faster than Xiao Bei.

814
00:36:48,402 --> 00:36:49,003
And killed Xiao Bei.

815
00:36:49,322 --> 00:36:50,162
At that moment, Nezha rushed to kill Zero.

816
00:36:50,162 --> 00:36:51,082
pretty

817
00:36:51,082 --> 00:36:52,283
The team won the match point.

818
00:36:52,283 --> 00:36:53,243
And won the game.

819
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:57,842
Naughty boy.

820
00:37:00,283 --> 00:37:01,122
You won.

821
00:37:01,602 --> 00:37:02,562
That's your attitude.

822
00:37:03,243 --> 00:37:04,402
To torture me.

823
00:37:05,043 --> 00:37:05,802
You won.

824
00:37:07,203 --> 00:37:07,923
On your marks

825
00:37:11,003 --> 00:37:11,642
Get set

826
00:37:21,602 --> 00:37:22,723
Speed up.

827
00:37:22,842 --> 00:37:23,642
Watch the swing.

828
00:37:23,923 --> 00:37:24,683
Watch the swing.

829
00:37:29,642 --> 00:37:30,283
Chu song

830
00:37:30,602 --> 00:37:30,923
Pretty good

831
00:37:31,243 --> 00:37:32,122
Twelve seconds, four hundred and eight.

832
00:37:32,562 --> 00:37:33,162
Keep up the good work.

833
00:37:33,363 --> 00:37:34,562
The others need to work harder.

834
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:36,043
And strive for good results.

835
00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:38,443
Chu song

836
00:37:39,282 --> 00:37:40,682
You must be hypoglycemic.

837
00:37:41,082 --> 00:37:42,202
You usually exercise so much.

838
00:37:42,642 --> 00:37:43,762
You must keep up with the nutrition.

839
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:46,443
I'm fine.

840
00:38:30,282 --> 00:38:30,883
Idiot

841
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,483
Dad, let's go.

842
00:39:03,162 --> 00:39:04,003
Little girl,

843
00:39:08,403 --> 00:39:09,443
What's your father's name?

844
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,242
My father's name is Chu Donghai.

845
00:39:17,803 --> 00:39:18,523
uncle

846
00:39:21,003 --> 00:39:24,202
Can you take me to see my father?

847
00:40:25,963 --> 00:40:26,682
Little girl,

848
00:40:29,843 --> 00:40:30,923
Why are you here?

849
00:40:31,082 --> 00:40:32,122
I'm looking for my dad.

850
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,722
He's taken by you.

851
00:40:35,443 --> 00:40:36,242
What's your father's name?

852
00:40:36,443 --> 00:40:38,043
My father's name is Chu Donghai.

853
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:39,403
Don't cry.

854
00:40:39,642 --> 00:40:40,883
Sit down.

855
00:40:42,642 --> 00:40:43,722
I'll ask for you.

856
00:40:45,403 --> 00:40:46,003
Check it for me.

857
00:40:46,003 --> 00:40:47,363
To see if there's a Chu Donghai.

858
00:40:47,363 --> 00:40:48,043
We caught

859
00:40:48,043 --> 00:40:48,562
good

860
00:40:48,883 --> 00:40:49,642
Get a towel.

861
00:40:49,803 --> 00:40:50,403
All right, road team.

862
00:40:52,122 --> 00:40:52,523
The road team.

863
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:53,403
No

864
00:40:54,602 --> 00:40:56,363
Call the precinct.

865
00:40:56,363 --> 00:40:57,202
To see if they

866
00:40:57,883 --> 00:40:58,803
The precinct command center?

867
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:00,202
Hello, Nanshan police station.

868
00:41:00,642 --> 00:41:02,043
Please ask if our precinct

869
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:03,602
Catch a man named Chu Donghai.

870
00:41:04,082 --> 00:41:04,523
The road team.

871
00:41:04,803 --> 00:41:06,122
I just heard from the precinct

872
00:41:06,523 --> 00:41:08,122
When they arrested Chu Donghai,

873
00:41:08,443 --> 00:41:09,722
He jumped off the car.

874
00:41:10,162 --> 00:41:11,003
He was badly injured.

875
00:41:20,523 --> 00:41:21,202
Hello

876
00:41:21,483 --> 00:41:23,602
I'm Lu Tianming from Nanshan Police Station.

877
00:41:23,923 --> 00:41:26,162
Please consult the leader.

878
00:41:26,682 --> 00:41:28,003
If you catch Chu Donghai,

879
00:41:28,242 --> 00:41:29,082
His daughter is here.

880
00:41:29,282 --> 00:41:30,202
Can you ask him to meet?

881
00:41:30,202 --> 00:41:31,363
What's wrong with this girl?

882
00:41:31,483 --> 00:41:33,443
The precinct just caught a murder suspect.

883
00:41:33,602 --> 00:41:34,242
Is her father.

884
00:41:35,963 --> 00:41:37,843
Is the Route Team communicating with the Precinct Leader?

885
00:41:38,242 --> 00:41:39,403
See if we can arrange a meeting.

886
00:41:41,562 --> 00:41:42,323
I see

887
00:41:42,883 --> 00:41:43,242
good

888
00:41:43,843 --> 00:41:44,403
Thank you

889
00:41:47,443 --> 00:41:48,803
How is the road team?

890
00:41:50,843 --> 00:41:52,162
Little girl, her father is dead.

891
00:41:55,003 --> 00:41:58,282
Uncle, can you take me to see my father?

892
00:41:58,523 --> 00:41:59,323
The rain is so heavy.

893
00:41:59,883 --> 00:42:01,202
There was a car accident at Tianbei Road.

894
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:03,003
Two boys were hit by a motorcycle.

895
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:05,602
The traffic police are on their way.

896
00:42:08,323 --> 00:42:09,363
What were you talking about?

897
00:42:10,242 --> 00:42:12,282
How old are the two children?

898
00:42:17,162 --> 00:42:18,403
It's not big.

899
00:42:20,483 --> 00:42:21,363
Take a look.

900
00:42:21,483 --> 00:42:22,282
I'm going out.

901
00:42:22,883 --> 00:42:23,602
uncle

902
00:42:23,602 --> 00:42:24,202
Little girl,

903
00:42:24,202 --> 00:42:25,122
Hold on.

904
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:40,363
Little girl,

905
00:42:44,403 --> 00:42:45,562
Go home and sleep, okay?

906
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:47,122
Where do you live?

907
00:42:47,762 --> 00:42:48,602
I'll send you home.

908
00:42:48,762 --> 00:42:50,963
But that uncle promised me

909
00:42:51,363 --> 00:42:53,122
He took me to see my father.

910
00:42:53,562 --> 00:42:54,483
Go home first.

911
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:56,642
You've been sitting here for two days.

912
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:59,602
But that uncle promised me

913
00:43:02,883 --> 00:43:04,523
Why don't you eat something first?

914
00:43:04,803 --> 00:43:05,122
Okay?

915
00:43:06,323 --> 00:43:07,282
I'm not hungry.

916
00:43:11,762 --> 00:43:13,363
What brought you here?

917
00:43:13,803 --> 00:43:14,602
I'm working here.

918
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:16,003
If I don't come here, where should I go?

919
00:43:16,003 --> 00:43:17,602
You should go home and spend more time with your sister-in-law.

920
00:43:17,963 --> 00:43:19,003
You're not fit to work.

921
00:43:19,003 --> 00:43:20,363
What's wrong with me now?

922
00:43:20,602 --> 00:43:21,843
Tell me what the condition is.

923
00:43:23,602 --> 00:43:24,403
uncle

924
00:43:25,923 --> 00:43:28,323
Can you take me to see my father?

925
00:43:40,762 --> 00:43:41,562
sorry

926
00:43:43,122 --> 00:43:44,363
I'm sorry to you.

927
00:43:45,242 --> 00:43:46,523
I forgot to tell you.

928
00:43:48,403 --> 00:43:49,483
Your father has

929
00:43:52,003 --> 00:43:52,883
He's dead.

930
00:43:53,242 --> 00:43:54,162
You can't see him.

931
00:44:00,162 --> 00:44:01,722
Come here, child.

932
00:44:12,963 --> 00:44:14,483
You lied to me.
