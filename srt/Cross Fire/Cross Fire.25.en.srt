1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,791
Start

2
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:53,208
I'm your fan.

3
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:53,958
My name is Qiqi.

4
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,166
Kirin asked a girl to have dinner.

5
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,750
It's Qiqi who is always with you.

6
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,541
What do you mean?

7
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:01,708
Aren't we the same?

8
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:02,916
Don't touch her.

9
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,041
You know Sha likes that girl, right?

10
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:06,791
I like it,too

11
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:07,875
There are so many girls. Don't you chase them?

12
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:08,958
You don't rob your own brothers.

13
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:10,208
Apologize to Lao Sha.

14
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:11,166
I'm not going to apologize.

15
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:11,750
What?

16
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,958
If you don't apologize today,

17
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:14,208
Don't play tomorrow.

18
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,083
I'll quit the team today.

19
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:17,125
How can you play without me?

20
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:20,875
It's my fault.

21
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:21,708
I failed to patch the hole.

22
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:23,208
Isn't the monkey mending the hole?

23
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,500
He can be used as a hidden weapon.

24
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,000
To poke holes in each other.

25
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:34,750
We met at this time.

26
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:36,458
When I was with you?

27
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,291
I looked for you but I didn't.

28
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:39,250
Are you looking for Xu Wei?

29
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:40,416
He's my best friend.

30
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:41,875
I want to ask you about someone.

31
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:42,541
Xiao Feng.

32
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:43,833
I haven't seen him for a long time.

33
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:46,166
Now we only have one way.

34
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,000
Is to go out.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,916
To win this game.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Nezha mending the gun.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,833
Nezha, fill the gun. Hold on.

38
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,500
Congratulations to the southern monster.

39
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,041
To win the semi-professional stage.

40
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,416
Aunts and uncles, we're here.

41
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,625
To congratulate you.

42
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:20,416
WangKai

43
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:21,583
Can you dance?

44
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:22,875
I won't.

45
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:24,458
You can walk and dance.

46
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,125
come

47
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,291
I didn't learn it.

48
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:28,916
Put your hands on your waist.

49
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:29,625
hand

50
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,041
Follow my rhythm.

51
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:32,666
One or two

52
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:33,583
sorry

53
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:34,416
Are you all right?

54
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:35,666
Nothing

55
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:36,250
come

56
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,291
One, two, three.

57
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:41,708
This...

58
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:42,541
sorry

59
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:44,625
Does it hurt?

60
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:45,375
Nothing

61
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,625
How about I stop practicing?

62
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,791
I'm too stupid.

63
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,708
No, I have to practice today.

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Be patient.

65
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,458
Then I'll take off my shoes.

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,791
Are you ready?

67
00:02:59,250 --> 00:02:59,916
to be ready

68
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,375
One, two, three.

69
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,500
One, two, three.

70
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,000
One, two, three.

71
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,375
One, two, three.

72
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,250
Susu

73
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,041
what are you doing?

74
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,208
To confess.

75
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,041
Can I do it later?

76
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,208
I haven't figured out how to say it.

77
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,000
Let me ask you a few questions.

78
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,375
Ask.

79
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,041
The first question.

80
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,000
If there is a very beautiful girl,

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,875
Sit on your lap.

82
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,083
Will you be tempted?

83
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,333
I won't be tempted.

84
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:47,916
WangKai

85
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,041
How dare you let a pretty girl sit on your lap?

86
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,291
The second question

87
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,000
If I get sick,

88
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,041
What would you do?

89
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,625
I'll tell you to drink more hot water.

90
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,541
Take a rest.

91
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:00,708
wrong

92
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,375
The standard answer is

93
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,375
Open the door

94
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,333
I'm here.

95
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:07,750
The last question.

96
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:09,958
If we are together in the future,

97
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,041
We quarreled.

98
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,000
Who should apologize?

99
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:12,875
I apologize.

100
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,333
Of course I apologized.

101
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,625
Are you stupid?

102
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,416
You should answer me.

103
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,041
How can I be willing to fight with you?

104
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:19,666
baby

105
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,375
How can I be willing to fight with you?

106
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:24,541
baby

107
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,208
I got all three questions wrong.

108
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,875
Is it stupid?

109
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,166
So cute.

110
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,833
You stepped on me again.

111
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,416
Are you hungry?

112
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,500
My name is Nezha. What about you?

113
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,291
I used to be a stray animal.

114
00:05:58,708 --> 00:05:59,916
Hello, Xiao Bei.

115
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,375
The car is downstairs. Come out.

116
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:02,625
Alright. Keep your voice down.

117
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:46,541
Black Town

118
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,291
Good morning!

119
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,083
Why are you so early?

120
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,375
You ran away a little late.

121
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,166
Take this with you.

122
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,333
Big A.

123
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:02,458
I've definitely seen this.

124
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,916
The most restored black town.

125
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,791
This running map must be very effective.

126
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,625
You're the only one who can do it.

127
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,458
Your father's motto is

128
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,333
If you want to do it, do it best, or don't.

129
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:13,375
That's enough.

130
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,791
Don't pressure the child, okay?

131
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,625
Xiao Bei doesn't have to listen to him.

132
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,708
What is it? Let's try our best.

133
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,208
Don't be hard on yourself, okay?

134
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:20,958
good

135
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,625
You're both right.

136
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:23,958
Come on

137
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,583
I'm back

138
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,916
I'm telling you, I have found the skill of live streaming.

139
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:28,916
What skill?

140
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:30,791
You must keep shouting.

141
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,208
Old Tie, double tap.

142
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,750
You don't have to be as beautiful as me.

143
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,250
How beautiful I am!

144
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:40,666
Oh, my God.

145
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,750
This is...

146
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,375
I made instant noodles the night before the finals.

147
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,500
I haven't cleaned up. Oh, my God.

148
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,833
You can use it as a chemical weapon.

149
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,375
It's a perfect start to the new season.

150
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,375
Captain, are we early?

151
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,833
Alright, pack up.

152
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:56,833
Come on.

153
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:00,291
Correct!

154
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,583
I still have instant noodles upstairs.

155
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,125
I went up to check my clothes.

156
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:10,750
These two people

157
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,666
What are you doing?

158
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:30,833
You knocked me off my feet.

159
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,125
You stepped on my shoes before.

160
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,416
sorry

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,041
Do you have no brain or eyes?

162
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:36,666
Does it hurt?

163
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,458
I'll rub it for you.

164
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,791
What? Are you serious?

165
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,125
narrow-minded

166
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,083
narrow-minded

167
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:48,083
You did something wrong, and you said I was narrow-minded.

168
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,083
Didn't I say sorry to you?

169
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,583
What's your attitude now?

170
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:52,583
What's my attitude?

171
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,083
Okay, Wang Kai.

172
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,875
What did you say when you were chasing me?

173
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:56,875
I'm right about everything.

174
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,625
I'm your sweet little girl.

175
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,166
If you catch me now, you'll be exposed.

176
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,541
Let's stay out of other people's business.

177
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,125
We can't meddle.

178
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:05,083
go

179
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,333
It's a matter of attitude.

180
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,916
You don't have me in your heart.

181
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,083
If you really like me,

182
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:09,625
How could you...

183
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:10,791
To talk to me like this.

184
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,000
Why am I missing you?

185
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,458
I'm telling the truth, right?

186
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,125
I want to tell you that

187
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,500
Don't be so hypocritical like other girls.

188
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,625
Other girls

189
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,375
Who are the other girls? Tell me.

190
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,000
Sure, Wang Kai.

191
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,583
I was wrong.

192
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,291
She used to be pure and cute.

193
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,041
Is acting in front of me.

194
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,166
Are you sure this is the sweet period?

195
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,500
Su Jiayi, you're going too far.

196
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:34,958
I finally understand.

197
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,291
Why did Steve break up with you?

198
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,208
You're such a bad-tempered girl.

199
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,250
Who wouldn't break up with you?

200
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:39,708
good

201
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,166
You still call me by my name?

202
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,333
Then let's break up now.

203
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,583
Are you threatening me?

204
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,041
How dare you threaten me?

205
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,708
The world of young people

206
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:48,583
I'm the one

207
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,000
To inform you.

208
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,708
Kneel down. My God.

209
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:54,500
Tell me,

210
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,333
What were they arguing about?

211
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,750
I think they broke up.

212
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,250
What happened to them just now?

213
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,375
You fooled me.

214
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,250
It seems

215
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,291
We're still young.

216
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:04,750
That's right.

217
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,666
You're right.

218
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,833
Don't be in love.

219
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,083
What is it? Nothing.

220
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,875
Yes, the game is fun.

221
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:12,750
Let's practice shooting.

222
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,125
go

223
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,125
Let's go.

224
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,250
I quit this year.

225
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,041
The position of captain can be given to you.

226
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,041
Your technical director will be on duty next Monday.

227
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,416
Tell me about your conditions.

228
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,000
Champion, I'm only interested in this.

229
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,250
Me too.

230
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,875
I believe in my own vision.

231
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,833
I believe in your ability.

232
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,458
But the only variable is the southern monster.

233
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,375
Now the whole league is talking about this dark horse.

234
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:41,791
I have to admit that

235
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,583
Lu Xiao Bei created a miracle.

236
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,000
everybody

237
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:55,750
To ask for your opinion.

238
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,166
Our first champion.

239
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,750
Where to put it.

240
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,166
to bring

241
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,416
Put it here.

242
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,833
You can see clearly when you enter the door.

243
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,500
On the table.

244
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:05,333
Put it here.

245
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,166
I've been watching

246
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,291
It's good here.

247
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,541
Brother Zha.

248
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,625
Give me your opinion.

249
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:14,458
Where can I put it?

250
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,416
I listen to the captain.

251
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:17,958
Young man.

252
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,041
Now this sycophant

253
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,291
Is a threat to me.

254
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,083
Xiaobei

255
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:22,583
Where should I put it?

256
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:23,625
It's up to you.

257
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:25,833
I think

258
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:29,666
Put it away.

259
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,583
I only did one thing during this time.

260
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,291
I've studied all of Lu Xiao Bei's game videos.

261
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,750
He improved very fast.

262
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,375
I like your attitude.

263
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,500
Pay attention to your opponent.

264
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,500
He has his own weakness.

265
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,375
I'm looking forward to the new season.

266
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,083
This is the semi-professional league trophy.

267
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,000
Those are also

268
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:58,791
And then,

269
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,791
To play a higher professional league.

270
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:02,958
The high school diploma.

271
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,666
You showed it off when you were in college.

272
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,125
That's our fault.

273
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,250
hurry up

274
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,375
Put them away.

275
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,666
In the past five years,

276
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,000
There are ten teams in total.

277
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,708
From semi-professional to professional.

278
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,583
Nine of them were downgraded that year.

279
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,458
Only one.

280
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,958
And stay in the professional league.

281
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,166
That's gravity.

282
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:26,500
From now on,

283
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,125
Our way

284
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,083
It will be harder to go.

285
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:36,791
monkey

286
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:37,625
I'm telling you,

287
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,708
You must drink it today.

288
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:39,541
But you can't vomit.

289
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:40,875
I can't go to the bathroom.

290
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:41,458
Yes

291
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,833
I'll accompany him when he goes to the bathroom.

292
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:43,791
You must, Chang Sha. Follow him.

293
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,750
Take a photo of mine. My phone has a high pixel.

294
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,583
Yes

295
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,500
Why are you always doing this?

296
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,958
It's been so long.

297
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,541
I ran into someone I know.

298
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,416
You don't have to say it.

299
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:20,541
I know you're leaving. They are running against you.

300
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,041
Let's go, right?

301
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,041
Come and have a drink with them.

302
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,208
Why are you leaving?

303
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:24,875
come

304
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,416
Have a drink.

305
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:27,708
Who wants to drink with you?

306
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,958
You're really something.

307
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,916
I know about my brother.

308
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,875
I'm counting with you today.

309
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:36,666
come

310
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,500
Who do you think you are?

311
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,458
Forget it.

312
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,791
What are you talking about?

313
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,000
No, no one is working today.

314
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,583
You don't have to stop me.

315
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:45,458
I'm helping you.

316
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,791
Can you stop it?

317
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,916
What are you talking about?

318
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,708
Brother Zhong.

319
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,916
I asked you to pay the bill. Where did you buy it?

320
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,083
trifle

321
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:54,833
sorry

322
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,833
Do you know I want to sing?

323
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,083
Sing, sing. I'll be there soon.

324
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:58,875
Fool

325
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,583
Sorry, brother.

326
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,750
Be there soon.

327
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:03,458
to pay the restaurant bill

328
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,708
Take us as brothers.

329
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,333
Just go there.

330
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,791
Stay away from them.

331
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:27,625
Sorry to bother you.

332
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,375
Eat well and drink well.

333
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:37,958
Unicorn

334
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,041
Is that interesting?

335
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,541
Are you doing this to yourself?

336
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,791
You're smart.

337
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,416
Why are you doing such a stupid thing?

338
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,833
Drink and mingle with society.

339
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,416
Do you really think you're 18 years old?

340
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,916
You did something wrong and you admit it.

341
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,791
You're like this.

342
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,208
Are you worthy of it?

343
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,166
I called you, but you didn't answer.

344
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,875
You didn't reply to my messages.

345
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,208
Don't stop your brothers.

346
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,458
Let them us.

347
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,958
Let you be an asshole. You don't even act like that.

348
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,833
You're tall.

349
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,708
Two idiots with no head.

350
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:37,833
Stop it.

351
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:39,833
Why are you crying?

352
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:41,583
It's embarrassing.

353
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:42,500
Come here.

354
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,166
get up

355
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:47,541
Come here

356
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:50,541
Sit down

357
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:53,750
Apologize to Lao Sha.

358
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,000
Enough. Don't cry.

359
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,541
Apologize to Shah. It's okay.

360
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,375
Old sand.

361
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:18,875
I was wrong.

362
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,833
Can you forgive me?

363
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,041
Old sand.

364
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:27,750
I was wrong.

365
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,666
sorry

366
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,875
Please forgive me.

367
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,375
I can forgive you.

368
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:36,875
but

369
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,375
You must apologize to Qiqi.

370
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,208
I'll go tomorrow.

371
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,250
I'll go tomorrow.

372
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,916
I forgive you. Don't cry.

373
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,333
I

374
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,708
I dare not

375
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,125
Welcome back.

376
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:00,041
come

377
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,416
Thank you, leader.

378
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,250
I shouldn't have quarreled with you that day.

379
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,083
Alright.

380
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,250
Welcome home.

381
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,583
Welcome back.

382
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,375
Thank you. I was wrong.

383
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,250
Don't you always want me to treat you?

384
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,708
Let's go to the canteen.

385
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,333
Sure.

386
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,875
It's my conscience.

387
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,125
I'm here to celebrate you winning the championship.

388
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,125
Then I have to eat something delicious.

389
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,333
I can't stand you.

390
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:45,625
Isn't this Senior Gao?

391
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,250
Why is he so haggard?

392
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,166
Nothing lasts forever.

393
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,250
Brother Gao.

394
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,333
Lu Xiao Bei,

395
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,458
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

396
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,916
I have a few words to say to you in person.

397
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,916
Chuge is a good girl.

398
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,416
You should cherish her.

399
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:19,333
I wish you happiness.

400
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:24,791
Your guitar.

401
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,000
What does he mean?

402
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:28,666
I don't know.

403
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,458
He told me to cherish you.

404
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:32,583
Is this nonsense?

405
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,750
I don't cherish you, I will harm you.

406
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,000
Aren't you hungry?

407
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,833
Hurry up and eat.

408
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,625
What about the guitar?

409
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:40,750
Should we sell it?

410
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,083
Can sell for a lot of money.

411
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:42,958
You're dead.

412
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,583
Miss, you still want a bowl of rice.

413
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,500
A vegetarian dish, right?

414
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:48,875
No, it's my treat.

415
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:49,833
What are you eating?

416
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:51,708
Both of them.

417
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:53,291
Is this okay?

418
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,125
Chu song

419
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:55,625
There are two empty seats.

420
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:56,500
Take it first.

421
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,000
good

422
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,041
It's my treat. Help yourself.

423
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:58,708
good

424
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,250
Don't worry.

425
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:05,708
I sent the most expensive dishes

426
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:06,500
I ordered them all.

427
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,208
The canteen staff were stunned.

428
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,208
It's rare for you to kill me today.

429
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,125
Eat it.

430
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:13,500
Don't leave until you finish.

431
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:14,833
Correct!

432
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,083
How is your preparation for the new season?

433
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,083
not up to much

434
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,416
There are so many problems.

435
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,291
You have a big head.

436
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,750
You just won the championship.

437
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:23,541
What's wrong?

438
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,250
Tencent e-sports games are only semi-professional.

439
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,541
Crossfire Professional League

440
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,000
Is a serious professional league.

441
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,375
To a higher level.

442
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,208
Not only the skills of the players,

443
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,291
But also test the professionalism of the team.

444
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,375
Without a coach,

445
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:36,291
Two, no leader.

446
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,500
You don't even have a reliable staff.

447
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,291
Eat.

448
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:44,375
What are you thinking?

449
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,250
You want me to feed you?

450
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,250
Come to Chujiang.

451
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:55,916
Why is it him again?

452
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,500
That's it.

453
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,333
I'm going back to training.

454
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,125
I'll send you back.

455
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,083
No need

456
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:03,916
I called the taxi. It's already here.

457
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,041
Let me buy you a drink.

458
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:07,583
It tastes good.

459
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,708
A full cup of grapefruit.

460
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:13,625
26 yuan.

461
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,166
Okay, that's enough.

462
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:21,458
Thank you

463
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:22,416
Nothing

464
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,125
Esports is full of

465
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,000
A place full of miracles is developing rapidly.

466
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,166
Everything will be better in the future.

467
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,000
I believe

468
00:20:59,250 --> 00:20:59,916
Chu song

469
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:00,833
Hello?

470
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:01,916
It's your turn.

471
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:02,875
Come in with me.

472
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,458
Hello

473
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:12,333
I'm Chu Ge.

474
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,208
Don't introduce yourself.

475
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:13,833
sit

476
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,291
What do you think of the e-sports industry?

477
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,750
I think the e-sports industry

478
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,541
Is a place full of miracles.

479
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:23,708
Is developing rapidly.

480
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,583
In the future,

481
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,250
It will definitely have better expectations in the future.

482
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:28,583
Go out and turn left. There's a garbage can.

483
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:29,708
Get rid of everything in your hands.

484
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:30,750
Ask the next person to come in.

485
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:35,500
Is Wang Yi Fei there?

486
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:36,166
in

487
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:36,958
It's your turn.

488
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,041
I didn't behave well just now.

489
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,208
Can you give me another chance?

490
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,000
Opportunity is for those who are prepared.

491
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,083
I don't think you are ready.

492
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,375
Miss, please go out.

493
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,833
Actually, I'm here for someone.

494
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,083
I was the last in high school.

495
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,791
My deskmate helped me get into college.

496
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:18,625
He's a smart

497
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:19,708
And has a dream.

498
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,291
He's playing professional e-sports now.

499
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:22,666
So I want to fight for this chance.

500
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:23,875
I'll learn something.

501
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,041
I hope I can help him someday.

502
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:27,583
So you did it for selfish reasons.

503
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,250
Not out of interest in e-sports.

504
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:32,666
Yes

505
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:34,708
I don't know anything about e-sports.

506
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:35,750
I've never played games.

507
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:37,000
But I know him.

508
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:39,041
This is his dream.

509
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:40,375
therefore

510
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:42,208
I want to help him with it.

511
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,375
Copy it and send it to each department.

512
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,083
So I was admitted?

513
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:53,375
When can I start work?

514
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:54,916
You're already at work.

515
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:02,458
left

516
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:07,916
AnLuan

517
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:12,416
The girl's resume and performance are all ordinary.

518
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:13,916
Why did you choose her?

519
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:16,791
You dare to fight for it if you fail in the interview.

520
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:17,958
It means she has guts.

521
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,958
You admit you don't know anything about e-sports?

522
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:21,583
It means she's honest.

523
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:23,791
Also

524
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,333
She's awkward and hardworking.

525
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,208
It's like me when I just graduated.

526
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,416
Okay, next, I'll take you

527
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,125
Go to the scene and have a look.

528
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:40,041
Our photography

529
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,208
Is working on the map.

530
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:43,375
How many times have I told you?

531
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,833
Our logo needs to be put forward.

532
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:45,625
Just a little bit more.

533
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,083
The sign must be higher.

534
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
More prominent.

535
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,583
OK

536
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:51,416
I'll change it right away.

537
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:53,166
Okay, hurry up.

538
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:53,583
good

539
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:56,250
Let's go to the scene now.

540
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,291
This is our Ling Fox.

541
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:00,208
How is it? Is it slutty enough?

542
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,708
I'm telling you,

543
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,291
The little figure of Linghu

544
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,333
So charming.

545
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:05,875
to wait a moment

546
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,500
I'm on the air to say hello to my audience.

547
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:09,250
come

548
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:10,416
To pose.

549
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:10,958
come

550
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,958
And sent a short video every day.

551
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:15,125
To advertise myself.

552
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,000
What a problem!

553
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:18,750
Then get rid of him.

554
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,291
It's easy to say.

555
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:21,916
That's the sponsor's staff.

556
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:22,875
Who dares to offend?

557
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:24,458
Yes

558
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:25,416
This time,

559
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,041
You must smile, you know?

560
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:27,916
You're slightly like this.

561
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:31,291
Who are you?

562
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:32,333
Why do you turn me off?

563
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:33,375
This is the Crossing Fire Professional League.

564
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:34,708
The shooting scene of the promotional materials.

565
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:35,833
Please leave.

566
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,375
Who are you? How dare you throw me away?

567
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:40,125
I'm the new intern of Chuge.

568
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:42,958
I said you wanted to sting someone.

569
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:44,750
I'm going to find your boss. Do you believe it?

570
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,333
I told her to get rid of it. Do you believe that?

571
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:46,833
good

572
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:48,791
But please go out now.

573
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:50,166
Alright.

574
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:51,041
You wait.

575
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:52,083
Wait for me.

576
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,583
Wait for me too.

577
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:56,833
Tell me about it.

578
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:57,625
What are you thinking?

579
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,708
He's on the set.

580
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,666
Violated Article 16 of the sponsorship contract.

581
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:07,458
Sponsorship contract

582
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:08,708
How did you see it?

583
00:25:08,916 --> 00:25:10,875
When you asked me to sign the contract,

584
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:14,041
What do you think should be done?

585
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:16,875
I heard that this guy

586
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:18,500
To their boss.

587
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,666
It's really serious this time.

588
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:20,833
They insist that

589
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,666
Get rid of our intern.

590
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:26,000
Chuge did the right thing.

591
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,666
She not only stood up for our interests,

592
00:25:28,666 --> 00:25:30,250
And protect the interests of the sponsor.

593
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:32,875
To be honest, I'm disappointed.

594
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:34,333
You didn't come forward.

595
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:35,583
But an intern.

596
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,250
Get out of here.

597
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:43,125
Is there anything else?

598
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:00,833
Stop fighting.

599
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:01,541
I'm here.

600
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:03,791
It's time to play the finals.

601
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:05,041
Yes, tomorrow afternoon.

602
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:05,833
What about you?

603
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:06,833
Crossing the Line of Fire.

604
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,125
The new season is about to begin.

605
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:09,333
Tomorrow is the launch ceremony.

606
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:10,791
All ten teams will participate.

607
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:13,541
Did you find Xu Wei?

608
00:26:13,541 --> 00:26:14,583
Have you contacted me?

609
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:15,708
Nothing.

610
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:16,958
But I saw Xu Wei.

611
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,041
he

612
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,750
He said he didn't have your contact information.

613
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,625
Nonsense

614
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:23,625
How could he not have my contact information?

615
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:26,833
What about the rest of the team?

616
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:29,041
Ah Ming, the monkey, Lao Sha,

617
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:30,958
Think of another way.

618
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:34,500
It's impossible.

619
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:36,500
Go to my hometown.

620
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,833
I'll give you my address.

621
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:39,041
That's fine.

622
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:44,458
Captain, it's unlikely that

623
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:45,583
I think

624
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:46,583
He just doesn't know you well.

625
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:47,666
I don't know why you want to see me.

626
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:49,125
I won't give you my contact information.

627
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:51,500
We're pants-wearing friends.

628
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,500
very close male friends

629
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:56,583
Don't think too much.

630
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:57,791
To prepare for the competition tomorrow.

631
00:26:58,166 --> 00:26:59,458
I'll go to your hometown if I have time.

632
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,000
Are you ready to win the national championship?

633
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:09,416
It's like a dream.

634
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:10,666
sometimes

635
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:13,458
The closer I get, the more I can't believe it.

636
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:17,625
Don't spoil it.

637
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:18,750
I've already figured it out.

638
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,375
The process tomorrow will be very difficult.

639
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,125
It's harder than you think.

640
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:24,416
That's why I became

641
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:26,041
A classic battle in the history of crossing the line of fire.

642
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:27,708
Don't scare me.

643
00:27:27,708 --> 00:27:29,583
If you scare me again, I won't be able to sleep at night.

644
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,083
Don't.

645
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:32,750
If a man wants to be successful,

646
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:35,166
You have to have some unrealistic confidence.

647
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:36,291
You said that.

648
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:43,458
No matter how confident you are,

649
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,083
You will be scared.

650
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:46,791
I'm not as brave as you think.

651
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,208
Only when you're scared,

652
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,083
And become brave.

653
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,000
I said that.

654
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:56,250
can

655
00:27:56,583 --> 00:27:57,958
What are you thinking?

656
00:28:03,791 --> 00:28:06,041
Beibei, didn't you ask me to search the Great God?

657
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:06,833
Xiao Feng.

658
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,458
What are you searching for?

659
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:10,708
I suddenly found something very weird.

660
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:13,625
Didn't the Gangfen Team win the championship in October 2009?

661
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,375
But then the team disbanded.

662
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:16,583
It's not logical.

663
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:17,833
Yes

664
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:19,416
At the end of the year,

665
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:21,375
Xu Wei set up the Gravity Club.

666
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:22,458
Since then,

667
00:28:22,791 --> 00:28:24,750
We can't find any information about Xiao Feng anymore.

668
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,375
Why are you so interested in him?

669
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:27,291
curious

670
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:30,208
I've always wanted to know

671
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,750
Xiao Feng, where is he now?

672
00:28:33,416 --> 00:28:34,083
what are you doing?

673
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:35,125
You want to learn from him?

674
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:37,958
If he can coach our club,

675
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:39,458
I have nothing to worry about.

676
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:42,875
I found a saying in the forum.

677
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:43,958
What do you mean?

678
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:45,041
Someone said that

679
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:46,666
Xiao Feng won the championship,

680
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:47,666
Something's wrong.

681
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:48,625
Something's wrong.

682
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:49,291
You're in.

683
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:50,083
What do you mean?

684
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:51,416
Someone said he did something.

685
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,333
I thought it was ridiculous at first.

686
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:55,333
But then I thought it made sense.

687
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,041
Otherwise, why can't we find him for so many years?

688
00:28:57,041 --> 00:28:58,291
I haven't heard anything from him.

689
00:28:58,625 --> 00:28:59,500
Send me the link.

690
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:06,833
Welcome to the first...

691
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:09,416
The final of the Crossing the Line Of Fire National Challenge.

692
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:11,208
After months of competition,

693
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,958
The final will be

694
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:15,083
The team from Ning Jiang Team.

695
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:17,625
And the Sea Hunter Team from Haitang.

696
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,125
Through today's competition,

697
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:22,041
Will be the first Chinese cross-fire champion.

698
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:23,416
Let's have a rest.

699
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:24,833
The game is about to begin.

700
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:27,875
I didn't expect that

701
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:29,166
The opponent of the final.

702
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:32,125
Is the sea hunter we missed.

703
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:32,791
They are recognized

704
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:34,416
The team that doesn't have the ability to win the championship.

705
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:35,250
All the people

706
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,791
To take advantage of them.

707
00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:38,625
But they wiped them out.

708
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:41,041
They fought hard to get here.

709
00:29:41,416 --> 00:29:42,875
Is a dark horse.

710
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:44,500
Who grew up in a fishing village.

711
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,333
If you lose,

712
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:46,583
I have to go back to fish.

713
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:47,541
therefore

714
00:29:47,666 --> 00:29:49,625
Let's see who can make it to the last game.

715
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:52,708
Are you feeling ill?

716
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,208
No, I'm fine.

717
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:55,416
Then why are you sweating so much?

718
00:29:58,458 --> 00:29:59,416
You have a fever.

719
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,083
I don't have a fever.

720
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:03,458
The hot pot we had yesterday

721
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:04,791
It might be a little hot.

722
00:30:06,916 --> 00:30:08,291
Captain, are you all right?

723
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:09,875
Gargle.

724
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:12,958
The decisive battle is between the two sides.

725
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:14,083
And sea hunters.

726
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:16,250
The competition will adopt the best of three rounds.

727
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,458
The one-game system.

728
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:18,958
The map used in this competition is

729
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:19,875
Black Town

730
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:20,875
This old sand

731
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:21,583
Go to point B.

732
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:22,583
Ming, go to point A.

733
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:23,000
OK

734
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,875
Captain, Kirin, follow me to the middle.

735
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:25,333
good

736
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,166
Pay attention.

737
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:29,041
It's too late.

738
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:29,291
understand

739
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:29,750
Received

740
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,458
There's a sniper in the middle.

741
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,125
Received

742
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:39,166
A On the Grand Staircase,

743
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,500
I saw it.

744
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:42,666
A little.

745
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:43,708
Don't worry.

746
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:44,833
To slow them down.

747
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:45,750
Point A, fire support.

748
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:49,666
super!

749
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:50,208
Hold still

750
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:51,416
The Steel Coin Team is a team.

751
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,541
To attack the oppressive team.

752
00:30:53,541 --> 00:30:55,041
And the style is changeable.

753
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:57,166
If they take the lead to open the situation,

754
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:59,541
Their opponent will be very passive.

755
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:11,791
Team Gangfen scores first.

756
00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:14,125
It's indeed a team from Hell Tournament.

757
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:16,000
You can't be underestimated.

758
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,041
Let's look at the Sea Hunter Team opposite.

759
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:19,833
Facing such a strong opponent,

760
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:21,625
How will they react?

761
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:25,791
Door B is here.

762
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:31,166
The sea hunters didn't act randomly.

763
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:32,833
And quickly scored a point.

764
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:34,000
And surrounded them.

765
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:35,208
I threw it away.

766
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:36,125
Hold on.

767
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:37,083
Move back.

768
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:56,375
fall

769
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:59,208
After the fierce war,

770
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,166
The score of the Steel Coin Team is 10 to 4.

771
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:02,833
Take the first round.

772
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,583
But they take too long in each round.

773
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:06,166
It's physically demanding.

774
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:07,166
For them,

775
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:08,791
Is a big problem.

776
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:09,833
Brothers,

777
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:12,166
You have enough food.

778
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:14,041
Get ready

779
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:15,250
Throw the hook.

780
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:26,875
There's someone here at B.

781
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:27,791
If you can bear it,

782
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:31,666
Look at my back.

783
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:33,166
There's someone behind my ass.

784
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:33,958
It's okay. Hold on.

785
00:32:33,958 --> 00:32:34,791
Unicorn

786
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:45,791
They are thieves.

787
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:53,583
It's a fast attack for sea hunters.

788
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:55,166
The troops were caught off guard.

789
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:56,666
Is indeed the strongest black horse.

790
00:32:57,416 --> 00:33:00,458
The Gangfen Team is the oldest player of all ages.

791
00:33:00,666 --> 00:33:02,583
Their physical strength and energy are definitely not as good as ours.

792
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:04,208
So you must hold off in the first round.

793
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:05,625
Remember, don't rush.

794
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:06,875
When they make a mistake first,

795
00:33:09,041 --> 00:33:10,541
I'm going after Xiao Feng.

796
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:10,958
good

797
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:12,166
I'm going to B with Kirin.

798
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:12,916
OK

799
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:14,708
They're coming.

800
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:15,791
Slow down.

801
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:17,875
I'm here.

802
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:18,333
I dropped it.

803
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:19,375
I'm going to Gate B.

804
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:21,458
The Kirin is gone.

805
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:22,583
Behind the box,

806
00:33:37,541 --> 00:33:38,250
Wait for me.

807
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,625
I saw someone.

808
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:48,166
It's wonderful.

809
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:50,208
The Sea Hunter won the second round 10-6.

810
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:52,250
But I think Xiao Feng of the Steel Coin Team

811
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,125
She's not doing well.

812
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,291
You're so burned.

813
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:57,375
And carry it on your own.

814
00:33:57,875 --> 00:33:59,708
It's called burning the universe.

815
00:33:59,708 --> 00:34:00,541
Hold on.

816
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:02,250
I'll just give them a big move.

817
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,625
There's no ice, only this one.

818
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:05,416
Doctor, we'll be there soon.

819
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:07,250
You must receive treatment as soon as possible.

820
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,666
Then I will apply for the monkey.

821
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:10,541
When the game is over,

822
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:12,375
Should I take the medicine or the injection?

823
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:13,625
I listen to the doctor.

824
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,416
Not now.

825
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,375
Don't get yourself killed.

826
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:20,166
You need a lot of skills to compete.

827
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:22,333
Fighting hard is also a skill.

828
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:28,708
The Chang Family Silver Needle is here.

829
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:30,083
It's not easy to get rid of them.

830
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:31,375
It can cure rheumatism.

831
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:34,041
The second shot is vicious.

832
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:36,333
three

833
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:39,000
Three needles can prolong life.

834
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:41,208
A long life.

835
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:43,333
Four needles and many descendants.

836
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:46,458
This needle may not be needed.

837
00:34:46,541 --> 00:34:47,708
You don't know.

838
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:50,625
He used me to practice acupuncture in his room every day.

839
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:52,125
I don't know if I can treat it.

840
00:34:52,416 --> 00:34:53,666
But it's refreshing.

841
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:55,041
Is it really refreshing?

842
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:56,375
That's for sure.

843
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:57,708
You were stabbed twice.

844
00:34:57,875 --> 00:34:59,291
Don't you think so?

845
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:02,375
Xiao Feng, how are you feeling now?

846
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,583
I'm very good.

847
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:04,458
Let's play a game.

848
00:35:08,791 --> 00:35:10,166
What's wrong with the others?

849
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:12,916
No

850
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:20,875
Are you feeling better?

851
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:21,583
That's it.

852
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:23,708
My silver needle will be better if it is electrified.

853
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:24,583
I'm too anxious today.

854
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:25,708
I didn't bring the battery.

855
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:26,666
Don't, Lao Sha.

856
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,500
If you add two more shots, I will leak.

857
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,125
If you turn on the power, I will be burned.

858
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:34,166
Brother Feng,

859
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,250
What's the tactic?

860
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,750
Come on

861
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:42,291
Did you notice that?

862
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:44,541
The opposite style is similar to their names.

863
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:45,750
Sea Hunter

864
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,041
It's like fishing at sea.

865
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:48,666
Throw the bait first, then the net.

866
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:50,083
They're hunters.

867
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:51,083
We are the prey.

868
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,500
If we want to recover,

869
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,125
You can't fall into their rhythm.

870
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,375
We need to find our own rhythm.

871
00:36:03,416 --> 00:36:04,208
It's impossible.

872
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,041
You can only use the trick.

873
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:07,666
That's a risky move.

874
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,166
Danger is when it's the most dangerous.

875
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:09,916
That's why it's used.

876
00:36:09,916 --> 00:36:11,291
Xiao Feng, stop joking.

877
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:12,583
If they figure it out,

878
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:14,083
We didn't even have a chance to turn the tables.

879
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:15,333
It's a big deal.

880
00:36:15,791 --> 00:36:16,416
I want to bet.

881
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:19,791
Do you want to calculate again?

882
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:34,583
Come on

883
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:35,250
go

884
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:37,416
Captain and Kirin are charging ahead.

885
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:37,833
OK

886
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:38,666
Five, go to Exit B with me.

887
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:43,666
After a short rest,

888
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:46,208
The troops have obviously adjusted their status.

889
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,541
Especially Captain Xiao Feng.

890
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:48,291
I found the gun sense.

891
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:50,000
He's back to being steady.

892
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,875
The whole team keeps pace with the attack.

893
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:53,791
And began to suppress the opponent.

894
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:58,125
At the crucial moment of the game,

895
00:36:58,125 --> 00:37:00,916
The Sea Hunters are on a four-game winning streak.

896
00:37:00,916 --> 00:37:03,500
The score is only one point.

897
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,541
If the team wins this point,

898
00:37:05,541 --> 00:37:07,083
Will be the national champion.

899
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:09,333
And the Sea Hunter won this point.

900
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:11,041
The game will go to overtime.

901
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:13,666
One point is the difference between heaven and hell.

902
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:14,583
This one.

903
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,083
We used that trick.

904
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:17,041
Captain, Lao Sha.

905
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:18,208
Go to point A.

906
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:20,375
Kirin, go to A.

907
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:20,958
good

908
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:22,166
Ming, go to the middle road.

909
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:23,208
Help me attract

910
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:24,041
Cover me.

911
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,333
Received

912
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,416
come

913
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:28,041
Come on

914
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:28,833
Come on

915
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:29,500
Come on

916
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,625
Come on

917
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:40,333
Watch out for Seven.

918
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:55,833
I'm in position.

919
00:38:26,416 --> 00:38:27,250
The target has been eliminated.

920
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:43,250
Everything is normal.

921
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:45,791
The second and the third

922
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:46,916
Go around the back.

923
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:47,375
understand

924
00:39:43,541 --> 00:39:44,833
Old Sha, give me the bag.

925
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:52,625
Wait

926
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:53,458
Don't worry!

927
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:56,833
I feel something is wrong.

928
00:39:58,750 --> 00:39:59,583
Be careful, everyone.

929
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:31,375
Xiao Feng, don't expose yourself.

930
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:29,791
come back

931
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,666
Why hasn't the captain gone to unpack it?

932
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:41,458
That's right, Captain.

933
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:42,458
It's almost time.

934
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,083
Hold on.

935
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:03,333
Unpack it.

936
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:17,875
Unpack it. Quickly.

937
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:43,000
You won.

938
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,791
After ten seconds of suffocation,

939
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:49,375
The winner of the first Crossing the Line Of Fire National Challenge is born.

940
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:53,125
He's from Ning Jiang Team.

941
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:56,375
After several months of competition,

942
00:43:56,375 --> 00:43:59,125
They didn't understand and sweated.

943
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:00,708
And shed a lot of tears.

944
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:03,583
But it's all worth it now.

945
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:05,666
Let's welcome Tencent Interactive Entertainment Fire Line.

946

00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,791

950
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:18,333
Let's welcome the third place winner.

The King's Cross is led by Captain Guo Lei.

953
00:44:22,375 --> 00:44:23,708
From Guangzhou Team.

954
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:25,666
Is the triple champion of Guangzhou Team.

955
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:28,000
Won the third place of the National Challenge.

956
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:30,041
Congratulations to the King of Kings.

957
00:44:32,958 --> 00:44:34,875
Next, the runner-up.

958
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:36,000
Sea Hunter

959
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,791
The father of one of the Sea Hunters

960
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:40,500
Fell seriously ill before the game.

961
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,833
They want the bonus.

962
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:43,625
To share the financial pressure of the family.

963
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:45,000
They are not only a group of

964
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,916
Young people who love esports

965
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:49,458
And a caring and filial child.

966
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,666
Please give them a round of applause.

967
00:44:51,958 --> 00:44:54,791
And congratulate them on winning the second place.

968
00:44:57,416 --> 00:44:58,000
Last

969
00:44:58,208 --> 00:45:00,250
Let's give the warmest applause

970
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:02,250
To the history of crossing the line of fire.

971
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:05,750
The first national champion.

972
00:45:06,208 --> 00:45:09,125
The Steel Coin Team was successfully resurrected from Hell Tournament.

973
00:45:09,125 --> 00:45:11,875
And fought through many difficulties all the way.

974
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,166
To the throne of the champion.

975
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:18,541

The highest personal honor.

00:47:45,625 --> 00:47:47,875
The captain of the Steel Coin Team.

981
00:47:47,875 --> 00:47:49,958
Seven, Xiao Feng.

982
00:48:23,916 --> 00:48:25,916
Let's figure out the money, okay?

983
00:48:28,416 --> 00:48:29,041
to wait a moment

984
00:48:33,875 --> 00:48:34,375
to

985
00:48:34,375 --> 00:48:36,458
Brother, we can't take the money.

986
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:38,208
It's important to treat your family.

987
00:48:40,041 --> 00:48:41,333
Brother, this is

988
00:48:41,958 --> 00:48:43,375
You won it.

989
00:48:43,375 --> 00:48:44,500
The money is not given for free.

990
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,000
After you get the national championship bonus,

991
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,958
Give it back to me.

992
00:48:47,166 --> 00:48:48,166
You can also add interest.

993
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:49,166
Thank you, brother.

994
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,583
I'll give you an IOU.

995
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:53,500
Don't waste it.
