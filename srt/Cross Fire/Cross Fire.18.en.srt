1
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:53,095
OK

2
00:02:53,095 --> 00:02:54,135
Mother of Chuge.

3
00:02:55,695 --> 00:02:57,055
Okay, I got it.

4
00:02:58,055 --> 00:02:58,734
Bye

5
00:03:02,494 --> 00:03:03,414
What did her mother say?

6
00:03:04,174 --> 00:03:05,574
She's not going to take the college entrance examination.

7
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:06,855
why

8
00:03:07,414 --> 00:03:08,614
The college entrance examination is only ten days away.

9
00:03:09,175 --> 00:03:10,975
He said he didn't get the result.

10
00:03:10,975 --> 00:03:12,375
The culture class is not good.

11
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,495
The exam is for nothing.

12
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:20,574
This is the test result of Chuge last week.

13
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:22,414
Even if you don't have a ranking,

14
00:03:22,414 --> 00:03:24,015
She has the same hope to enter the Southern Sports University.

15
00:03:24,214 --> 00:03:24,935
Miss Bai.

16
00:03:25,295 --> 00:03:26,094
Or

17
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,494
Go to Chuge's house.

18
00:03:27,854 --> 00:03:28,734
Talk to her.

19
00:03:29,494 --> 00:03:30,734
She's not at home now.

20
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,494
Her mother said

21
00:03:32,774 --> 00:03:34,214
She has found a job.

22
00:03:51,295 --> 00:03:52,494
Number 236.

23
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:55,575
Number 236.

24
00:03:55,575 --> 00:03:56,494
reach

25
00:04:01,214 --> 00:04:02,455
It's only been a day.

26
00:04:02,455 --> 00:04:03,535
Have found a job.

27
00:04:10,095 --> 00:04:10,895
Chu song

28
00:04:17,455 --> 00:04:18,414
Stop running.

29
00:04:18,854 --> 00:04:19,494
I'm done.

30
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,294
I'll leave after I talk to you.

31
00:04:22,854 --> 00:04:23,735
You know what?

32
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,574
Your biggest weakness

33
00:04:26,574 --> 00:04:27,854
You're too competitive with yourself.

34
00:04:28,175 --> 00:04:29,494
You lost a game.

35
00:04:30,294 --> 00:04:31,615
It's not the end of the world.

36
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:35,374
I didn't pass the Hundred Cities League.

37
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,934
I'm the same.

38
00:04:37,934 --> 00:04:39,014
You're alive and kicking here.

39
00:04:39,414 --> 00:04:40,695
So many difficulties.

40
00:04:41,095 --> 00:04:42,014
You've come through.

41
00:04:42,695 --> 00:04:43,774
Alright?

42
00:04:44,055 --> 00:04:45,535
Why don't you go to the exam room?

43
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:47,095
You tried. No.

44
00:04:47,214 --> 00:04:48,294
If you come here to work,

45
00:04:48,294 --> 00:04:49,735
If you work anywhere,

46
00:04:49,735 --> 00:04:50,854
I support you.

47
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,374
But if you give up now,

48
00:04:57,175 --> 00:04:58,095
Those who laugh at you

49
00:04:59,014 --> 00:05:00,735
The people who attacked you on the Internet

50
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,135
Those who are not as good as you,

51
00:05:02,814 --> 00:05:04,374
They want to see you give up.

52
00:05:04,814 --> 00:05:06,214
To prove them right.

53
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:09,015
Chu song

54
00:05:09,534 --> 00:05:11,295
I believe you don't have that extra point.

55
00:05:11,654 --> 00:05:13,055
You will be admitted to the Southern Sports University.

56
00:05:13,974 --> 00:05:14,974
So promise me.

57
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,214
Don't give up.

58
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:20,694
Don't take the world

59
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,135
To those who are not as good as you.

60
00:05:24,374 --> 00:05:25,735
Those who think you can't,

61
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:28,934
Okay?

62
00:05:31,254 --> 00:05:32,374
Your admission ticket.

63
00:05:33,814 --> 00:05:35,094
I've brought it back for you.

64
00:05:38,694 --> 00:05:40,415
Miss Bai should have talked to your parents.

65
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,654
No one can stop you from going to the college entrance examination.

66
00:05:48,295 --> 00:05:48,895
Chu song

67
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,055
We have added WeChat messages.

68
00:05:53,694 --> 00:05:55,335
We didn't block each other.

69
00:05:56,575 --> 00:05:58,254
It should be

70
00:05:58,254 --> 00:05:59,135
A friend.

71
00:06:00,575 --> 00:06:01,654
Don't worry.

72
00:06:03,575 --> 00:06:04,214
ostrich

73
00:06:04,934 --> 00:06:06,455
I will definitely find my own sand pile.

74
00:06:07,814 --> 00:06:08,735
friend

75
00:06:11,135 --> 00:06:12,615
Is used to resist the storm.

76
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,015
Stop hiding.

77
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:22,295
I'm leaving.

78
00:06:46,094 --> 00:06:47,295
Writing skills

79
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,295
During the three years in high school,

80
00:06:48,295 --> 00:06:49,494
Has taught you too much.

81
00:06:49,494 --> 00:06:50,415
right or wrong?

82
00:06:50,415 --> 00:06:51,055
Yes

83
00:06:51,055 --> 00:06:52,694
What I want to share with you today

84
00:06:52,694 --> 00:06:53,934
Is not a writing skill.

85
00:06:53,934 --> 00:06:55,694
But in an article,

86
00:06:56,055 --> 00:06:58,094
The most important feeling

87
00:06:59,654 --> 00:07:00,214
Presentation

88
00:07:01,135 --> 00:07:01,814
"please come in"

89
00:07:05,295 --> 00:07:06,094
teacher

90
00:07:06,654 --> 00:07:07,575
This is my composition.

91
00:07:14,694 --> 00:07:15,615
The Song of Chu.

92
00:07:17,055 --> 00:07:18,535
Can you give this composition

93
00:07:18,535 --> 00:07:19,655
Read it to everyone.

94
00:08:09,415 --> 00:08:10,535
My father.

95
00:08:14,735 --> 00:08:15,855
Is a murderer.

96
00:08:19,175 --> 00:08:20,535
In my memory,

97
00:08:23,134 --> 00:08:24,615
My father has been working very hard.

98
00:08:26,735 --> 00:08:28,894
He drives a big truck with ten wheels.

99
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,014
Run and transport.

100
00:08:30,894 --> 00:08:32,655
For more than ten hours.

101
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:35,694
In the wind.

102
00:08:37,694 --> 00:08:38,535
In the rain.

103
00:08:41,134 --> 00:08:43,215
But my father never said he was tired.

104
00:08:46,295 --> 00:08:47,535
As long as I have time,

105
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,055
He would play with me.

106
00:08:51,134 --> 00:08:52,095
To read with me.

107
00:08:53,055 --> 00:08:54,655
And help my mom with the housework.

108
00:08:57,175 --> 00:08:59,334
But these happy times

109
00:08:59,814 --> 00:09:02,454
Only stay in the autumn of 2008.

110
00:09:05,975 --> 00:09:08,055
Became a distant memory.

111
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:18,055
My dad's truck was in an accident.

112
00:09:18,894 --> 00:09:20,415
He lost a lot of money.

113
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:22,295
But the other person

114
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,334
You still want to earn a lot of interest.

115
00:09:25,415 --> 00:09:27,254
I really can't pay it back.

116
00:09:31,014 --> 00:09:32,535
The other side brought someone

117
00:09:35,535 --> 00:09:36,855
To the house.

118
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:42,215
And take me away with a high fever.

119
00:09:44,134 --> 00:09:46,574
My dad was crazy and took me back.

120
00:09:47,095 --> 00:09:48,095
Those people

121
00:09:50,134 --> 00:09:51,454
So I hit him with a steel pole.

122
00:09:56,415 --> 00:09:58,215
My dad was beaten with blood all over his face.

123
00:09:58,215 --> 00:09:58,894
He said

124
00:09:59,574 --> 00:10:00,215
Chu song

125
00:10:01,494 --> 00:10:02,215
to run fast

126
00:10:04,055 --> 00:10:05,014
Run!

127
00:10:07,494 --> 00:10:09,374
I ran very far that day.

128
00:10:09,374 --> 00:10:11,095
I didn't stop until I couldn't run anymore.

129
00:10:14,055 --> 00:10:16,134
When I come home,

130
00:10:18,055 --> 00:10:19,735
Dad was taken away by the police.

131
00:10:22,615 --> 00:10:23,694
They said

132
00:10:24,494 --> 00:10:25,574
My father killed someone.

133
00:10:26,454 --> 00:10:28,095
Is a cold-blooded murderer.

134
00:10:29,535 --> 00:10:30,574
But I know

135
00:10:31,415 --> 00:10:33,014
My father wanted to protect me.

136
00:10:33,775 --> 00:10:35,415
So I picked up a knife to resist.

137
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:40,655
The law can convict my father.

138
00:10:42,295 --> 00:10:43,415
But no one

139
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,374
To deny my father's love for me.

140
00:10:55,175 --> 00:10:56,615
Never.

141
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:02,535
I will always remember

142
00:11:03,055 --> 00:11:03,975
My dad said

143
00:11:04,535 --> 00:11:05,215
Chu song

144
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,254
to run fast

145
00:11:08,374 --> 00:11:09,415
Run!

146
00:11:12,014 --> 00:11:12,735
Run!

147
00:11:14,655 --> 00:11:15,134
to run fast

148
00:11:26,694 --> 00:11:28,854
So I don't care how hard the future is.

149
00:11:30,655 --> 00:11:31,614
I will.

150
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:33,614
Gamely

151
00:11:35,734 --> 00:11:36,495
Strongly

152
00:11:38,334 --> 00:11:39,255
Go on.

153
00:12:50,574 --> 00:12:52,175
I promised to repair your door for a long time.

154
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:53,375
I haven't fixed it.

155
00:12:53,775 --> 00:12:55,334
Today I bought something back.

156
00:12:56,454 --> 00:12:57,694
Let me fix it for you.

157
00:13:55,655 --> 00:13:56,614
Why are you still here?

158
00:14:00,094 --> 00:14:00,655
training

159
00:14:01,255 --> 00:14:02,495
Don't come again.

160
00:14:05,614 --> 00:14:06,655
We are eliminated.

161
00:14:18,175 --> 00:14:19,574
No one can fight forever.

162
00:14:20,094 --> 00:14:21,375
The team will be disbanded sooner or later.

163
00:14:33,175 --> 00:14:34,574
There's something else.

164
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:55,934
Did you win the last game?

165
00:15:57,535 --> 00:15:58,375
You won.

166
00:15:59,015 --> 00:15:59,814
But the integral is the same.

167
00:15:59,814 --> 00:16:00,854
To compete with the winner.

168
00:16:01,454 --> 00:16:02,375
Our team was eliminated.

169
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,535
Don't say anything comforting.

170
00:16:05,015 --> 00:16:05,535
What's up

171
00:16:05,934 --> 00:16:06,694
Why are you here?

172
00:16:07,454 --> 00:16:08,974
Do you remember what you asked me to do?

173
00:16:10,214 --> 00:16:10,974
What's wrong?

174
00:16:11,495 --> 00:16:12,255
I forgot.

175
00:16:12,974 --> 00:16:13,415
Nothing

176
00:16:13,934 --> 00:16:14,974
Before you remember,

177
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:15,934
I want you to meet someone.

178
00:16:18,214 --> 00:16:18,974
feed

179
00:16:19,614 --> 00:16:20,255
Hello

180
00:16:23,175 --> 00:16:24,814
Are you myself?

181
00:16:25,094 --> 00:16:26,015
He said

182
00:16:26,015 --> 00:16:28,094
You're me after 11 years.

183
00:16:30,015 --> 00:16:30,574
It's me.

184
00:16:31,135 --> 00:16:32,295
I'm you after eleven years.

185
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:40,814
Is it really 2020?

186
00:16:41,495 --> 00:16:42,135
yes

187
00:16:43,214 --> 00:16:43,934
In 2020,

188
00:16:43,934 --> 00:16:45,334
Friday May 31

189
00:16:46,854 --> 00:16:47,854
I want to know.

190
00:16:48,495 --> 00:16:49,775
What are you like now?

191
00:16:50,094 --> 00:16:52,334
Are you always in a wheelchair?

192
00:16:52,814 --> 00:16:55,094
I don't like this at all.

193
00:16:57,334 --> 00:16:57,974
I won't.

194
00:17:00,775 --> 00:17:01,694
Your legs.

195
00:17:02,974 --> 00:17:03,814
It will be fine.

196
00:17:04,614 --> 00:17:05,854
You will act like a normal person.

197
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,094
Can walk and run.

198
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:09,255
When you grow up,

199
00:17:09,255 --> 00:17:10,454
And handsome.

200
00:17:10,454 --> 00:17:11,934
There will be many good friends.

201
00:17:11,934 --> 00:17:12,655
In the school,

202
00:17:12,655 --> 00:17:14,135
And a lot of girls will like you.

203
00:17:15,175 --> 00:17:16,135
Your grades are good too.

204
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:17,094
Minimum

205
00:17:17,614 --> 00:17:18,775
To attend a good university.

206
00:17:19,334 --> 00:17:20,854
Are you sticking to your dream?

207
00:17:21,854 --> 00:17:22,934
Everything is fine.

208
00:17:25,775 --> 00:17:27,895
Can my legs really recover?

209
00:17:27,895 --> 00:17:29,614
I think you're lying to me.

210
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,214
But before that,

211
00:17:33,495 --> 00:17:35,255
You will encounter many things that make you sad.

212
00:17:35,934 --> 00:17:36,854
A lot of pain.

213
00:17:41,015 --> 00:17:42,574
You wanted to give up countless times.

214
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,655
You can't stand the pity of others.

215
00:17:46,655 --> 00:17:47,574
I can't stand the way

216
00:17:47,574 --> 00:17:49,055
And look at you like a poor loser.

217
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,015
You will feel useless.

218
00:17:51,895 --> 00:17:52,694
You will be scared.

219
00:17:53,015 --> 00:17:53,655
guilt

220
00:17:54,255 --> 00:17:55,614
You want to escape from reality,

221
00:17:58,055 --> 00:17:59,135
But you must remember that

222
00:17:59,775 --> 00:18:01,055
Everything will be fine.

223
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,694
You should stick to your dream.

224
00:18:02,974 --> 00:18:04,175
Never give up.

225
00:18:04,495 --> 00:18:05,574
In this world,

226
00:18:05,574 --> 00:18:06,614
There's no difficulty.

227
00:18:07,415 --> 00:18:08,614
You can stop Lu Xiao Bei.

228
00:18:09,295 --> 00:18:11,775
I want to be like my brother.

229
00:18:11,775 --> 00:18:13,895
To be a professional e-sports player.

230
00:18:14,614 --> 00:18:15,775
This is my dream.

231
00:18:16,415 --> 00:18:17,814
In the future?

232
00:18:25,574 --> 00:18:26,175
Meeting

233
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:31,334
Meeting

234
00:18:34,535 --> 00:18:35,135
I will.

235
00:18:38,775 --> 00:18:39,854
I will.

236
00:18:42,495 --> 00:18:43,655
I will.

237
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,135
Thank you for telling me this.

238
00:18:46,135 --> 00:18:47,055
I will try my best.

239
00:18:47,055 --> 00:18:48,895
Keep up the good work.

240
00:18:50,015 --> 00:18:50,775
I will.

241
00:19:07,574 --> 00:19:08,895
That man

242
00:19:09,854 --> 00:19:11,175
Is it really me?

243
00:19:12,454 --> 00:19:14,135
He will be you 11 years later.

244
00:19:14,694 --> 00:19:15,295
At first,

245
00:19:15,934 --> 00:19:16,655
I don't believe that.

246
00:19:17,655 --> 00:19:19,614
But then a lot of things have been proven.

247
00:19:22,255 --> 00:19:24,015
He said I can stand up in the future.

248
00:19:24,015 --> 00:19:25,535
There will be a lot of good friends.

249
00:19:25,535 --> 00:19:25,974
That's right.

250
00:19:26,574 --> 00:19:27,614
You have to trust him.

251
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,255
Didn't he say that?

252
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:30,175
You look so handsome.

253
00:19:31,574 --> 00:19:32,094
Come on

254
00:19:33,655 --> 00:19:34,214
I'm leaving.

255
00:19:35,495 --> 00:19:37,334
Can I still talk to him?

256
00:19:37,854 --> 00:19:38,295
Sure.

257
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:40,055
When I come back after the game,

258
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:41,375
I will come back for you.

259
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,775
Remember to lock this window.

260
00:19:45,055 --> 00:19:45,655
Let's go.

261
00:19:53,415 --> 00:19:54,895
Everything will be fine.

262
00:20:25,535 --> 00:20:27,334
You should take this to Shenzhen.

263
00:20:27,495 --> 00:20:28,495
The suitcase can fit.

264
00:20:28,814 --> 00:20:29,334
Nothing

265
00:20:29,975 --> 00:20:31,614
Why do you carry a host all the way here?

266
00:20:31,614 --> 00:20:32,695
There must be an internet café there.

267
00:20:32,695 --> 00:20:34,654
Your broken video card should be thrown away.

268
00:20:34,654 --> 00:20:35,775
Turn that fan.

269
00:20:35,775 --> 00:20:37,255
It's louder than that tractor.

270
00:20:37,255 --> 00:20:38,455
You don't understand.

271
00:20:38,455 --> 00:20:40,015
The mainframe is amazing.

272
00:20:40,735 --> 00:20:41,574
Can travel through time and space.

273
00:20:42,255 --> 00:20:44,295
Why don't you take you to the sky?

274
00:20:44,975 --> 00:20:45,414
Brother Feng,

275
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,334
Gao said he couldn't come at home.

276
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:50,535
Zhang Lei also texted me back.

277
00:20:50,535 --> 00:20:52,174
His mother wouldn't let him play with me.

278
00:20:52,174 --> 00:20:53,255
That's bullshit.

279
00:20:53,255 --> 00:20:54,215
It's an excuse.

280
00:20:54,215 --> 00:20:55,614
Our team is a piece of shit now.

281
00:20:55,614 --> 00:20:56,495
Everyone can hide.

282
00:20:56,495 --> 00:20:57,695
Don't you know?

283
00:20:58,255 --> 00:20:58,574
Cut the crap.

284
00:20:58,574 --> 00:21:00,215
Should we find someone else?

285
00:21:00,215 --> 00:21:01,094
We'll go tomorrow.

286
00:21:04,495 --> 00:21:05,455
Who are you looking for?

287
00:21:05,455 --> 00:21:06,414
I'm not welcome.

288
00:21:06,935 --> 00:21:07,614
Then I'm leaving.

289
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:10,535
Hurry! Someone!

290
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:11,134
The Kirin and the Phoenix.

291
00:21:11,134 --> 00:21:12,094
Brother Monkey.

292
00:21:12,094 --> 00:21:12,775
Belay

293
00:21:12,775 --> 00:21:13,414
Tie it.

294
00:21:13,854 --> 00:21:14,535
Put it on.

295
00:21:14,975 --> 00:21:15,894
Don't move. I'll do it.

296
00:21:15,894 --> 00:21:17,414
You tied me up.

297
00:21:17,414 --> 00:21:18,535
Who will help you in the competition?

298
00:21:18,535 --> 00:21:20,255
You have the conscience.

299
00:21:20,735 --> 00:21:22,255
We miss you so much, Brother Monkey.

300
00:21:22,495 --> 00:21:23,174
Sit down

301
00:21:23,695 --> 00:21:24,134
sit

302
00:21:25,055 --> 00:21:25,775
what?

303
00:21:25,775 --> 00:21:27,374
Your wife has taken care of it.

304
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:30,374
Tell you what,

305
00:21:30,775 --> 00:21:31,854
I'm at home now.

306
00:21:31,854 --> 00:21:33,334
You've reached a high position.

307
00:21:33,894 --> 00:21:34,775
Again.

308
00:21:34,775 --> 00:21:36,094
I'll call your wife now.

309
00:21:38,174 --> 00:21:39,055
It's unnecessary.

310
00:21:40,574 --> 00:21:42,535
My wife organized a study abroad.

311
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,015
I'll have a few fights with you.

312
00:21:55,094 --> 00:21:56,134
She's our leader.

313
00:21:56,134 --> 00:21:56,574
AnLuan

314
00:21:58,374 --> 00:21:59,055
Hou Zhihao

315
00:22:01,174 --> 00:22:02,614
Hello, my name is Chang Sha.

316
00:22:04,775 --> 00:22:05,334
Hello

317
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:18,854
Oh

318
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:18,614
Classmate

319
00:23:18,614 --> 00:23:19,614
You dropped something.

320
00:23:25,015 --> 00:23:26,134
Why are you here?

321
00:23:28,374 --> 00:23:29,574
The classroom is too stuffy.

322
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,614
I can't breathe.

323
00:23:32,894 --> 00:23:34,174
The exam is coming the day after tomorrow.

324
00:23:34,495 --> 00:23:35,735
With your fiery temper,

325
00:23:36,334 --> 00:23:37,695
I'll stop cheering you on.

326
00:23:38,094 --> 00:23:39,255
I'll pour some cold water on you.

327
00:23:39,975 --> 00:23:41,055
As the former table,

328
00:23:41,055 --> 00:23:42,374
It's my duty to remind you.

329
00:23:42,374 --> 00:23:43,495
In this final stage,

330
00:23:43,735 --> 00:23:44,894
Don't focus on sprinting.

331
00:23:45,574 --> 00:23:46,654
Relax.

332
00:23:47,174 --> 00:23:48,495
Do what you know.

333
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:49,574
Take the points you can get.

334
00:23:50,334 --> 00:23:51,535
Don't think about the rest.

335
00:23:52,255 --> 00:23:53,134
Believe in yourself.

336
00:23:53,775 --> 00:23:54,574
You can do it.

337
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:56,334
But I can't change it.

338
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:57,775
The problem of forgetfulness.

339
00:23:58,055 --> 00:23:59,735
If you can get rid of all the problems,

340
00:24:00,055 --> 00:24:01,094
You're not Chu Ge anymore.

341
00:24:01,854 --> 00:24:03,614
But I hate myself the most.

342
00:24:04,015 --> 00:24:05,134
If it can be changed,

343
00:24:06,295 --> 00:24:07,775
Maybe something so important

344
00:24:08,055 --> 00:24:08,935
I won't lose it.

345
00:24:11,215 --> 00:24:12,215
What is it?

346
00:24:13,455 --> 00:24:14,455
A necklace.

347
00:24:15,174 --> 00:24:16,735
Although it's not worth much,

348
00:24:18,174 --> 00:24:19,614
But there's a small photo inside.

349
00:24:21,495 --> 00:24:23,015
It's a picture of me and my father.

350
00:24:24,614 --> 00:24:25,495
at that time

351
00:24:25,894 --> 00:24:26,775
I'll go to the police station.

352
00:24:27,654 --> 00:24:28,775
To see my father for the last time.

353
00:24:32,134 --> 00:24:33,654
But my father didn't see it.

354
00:24:35,215 --> 00:24:36,174
And the necklace.

355
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:41,814
After the accident,

356
00:24:42,334 --> 00:24:43,975
My mother and I had to move somewhere else.

357
00:24:44,255 --> 00:24:46,094
All the photos at home were thrown away.

358
00:24:47,894 --> 00:24:49,015
So far,

359
00:24:49,814 --> 00:24:51,935
I didn't even take a photo with my father.

360
00:24:54,814 --> 00:24:55,814
Not a single one.

361
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:04,775
Is this it?

362
00:25:08,854 --> 00:25:11,134
I was in the water, but I didn't clean it in time.

363
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,455
That's why it's like this.

364
00:25:12,814 --> 00:25:14,894
Can this photo be fixed?

365
00:25:15,894 --> 00:25:16,814
It's unlikely.

366
00:25:17,094 --> 00:25:17,654
Look.

367
00:25:18,455 --> 00:25:20,495
The rust has been oxidized.

368
00:25:34,614 --> 00:25:35,854
I want to ask you a favor.

369
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:36,654
Please.

370
00:25:37,374 --> 00:25:38,374
Please.

371
00:25:38,374 --> 00:25:39,134
Call him Feng.

372
00:25:41,015 --> 00:25:41,535
I won't.

373
00:25:41,775 --> 00:25:42,295
I won't.

374
00:25:42,414 --> 00:25:43,174
I won't help you.

375
00:25:48,094 --> 00:25:49,695
Help or not?

376
00:25:55,935 --> 00:25:57,174
Are you going to help or not?

377
00:25:58,055 --> 00:25:58,975
Are you calling or not?

378
00:26:00,414 --> 00:26:01,975
Do you want to know about An Lan?

379
00:26:05,495 --> 00:26:06,055
What business?

380
00:26:25,174 --> 00:26:26,414
Can't you hear me?

381
00:26:26,775 --> 00:26:27,975
Why hasn't the garbage been emptied?

382
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:30,174
You have no memory at all.

383
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:31,495
What are you looking for?

384
00:29:26,695 --> 00:29:27,535
Calm down.

385
00:29:27,654 --> 00:29:28,495
Come on, Ming.

386
00:29:29,735 --> 00:29:30,614
The water is not hot.

387
00:29:30,614 --> 00:29:31,535
You can eat it as burning noodles.

388
00:30:05,374 --> 00:30:06,614
This is the best place

389
00:30:06,614 --> 00:30:08,215
The cheapest hotel.

390
00:30:08,215 --> 00:30:09,654
The conditions are a bit worse.

391
00:30:09,894 --> 00:30:11,495
But please make do with it.

392
00:30:11,495 --> 00:30:12,735
It's so great here.

393
00:30:12,735 --> 00:30:14,574
Look at the retro decoration of the whole house.

394
00:30:14,574 --> 00:30:15,215
Is it Captain?

395
00:30:30,775 --> 00:30:31,894
Not bad.

396
00:30:32,854 --> 00:30:33,334
Listen to this.

397
00:30:33,894 --> 00:30:35,495
And surround stereo sound.

398
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:37,414
This is the suburbs.

399
00:30:37,414 --> 00:30:39,854
It's still more than 20 kilometers away from the competition venue.

400
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:40,775
here

401
00:30:42,495 --> 00:30:43,414
Then tomorrow morning,

402
00:30:43,414 --> 00:30:45,015
I'll wake you up at seven.

403
00:30:45,015 --> 00:30:45,894
Rest early.

404
00:30:46,255 --> 00:30:46,854
key

405
00:30:47,295 --> 00:30:47,975
Here you are.

406
00:30:50,735 --> 00:30:51,535
Where are you going?

407
00:30:52,295 --> 00:30:53,255
I'll go to the internet café nearby.

408
00:30:53,255 --> 00:30:53,975
I'll handle it for one night.

409
00:30:54,495 --> 00:30:55,574
How can that be?

410
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:57,535
You're a girl who doesn't know her well.

411
00:30:57,535 --> 00:30:58,894
How can I let you spend the night alone?

412
00:30:59,495 --> 00:31:01,894
But it's an expense to open another room.

413
00:31:02,295 --> 00:31:02,894
No way

414
00:31:03,374 --> 00:31:04,134
How about this?

415
00:31:04,775 --> 00:31:06,414
Why don't you sleep in this room alone?

416
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:07,535
Let's sleep in the internet café.

417
00:31:07,535 --> 00:31:08,695
That's even worse.

418
00:31:10,614 --> 00:31:12,374
Okay, how about this?

419
00:31:12,894 --> 00:31:14,735
If you think we're more reliable than the Internet café,

420
00:31:14,935 --> 00:31:15,935
You can sleep in this bed.

421
00:31:18,094 --> 00:31:18,894
What about you?

422
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:17,654
Go to sleep.

423
00:32:37,935 --> 00:32:38,975
Take the bag for us.

424
00:32:52,174 --> 00:32:53,455
The golden house

425
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,215
The golden house

426
00:32:57,174 --> 00:32:58,174
This building is so tall.

427
00:32:58,174 --> 00:32:58,975
I can't even see it.

428
00:32:59,374 --> 00:33:00,935
Big cities are different.

429
00:33:00,935 --> 00:33:02,455
When can we

430
00:33:02,455 --> 00:33:03,854
To live in such a big city.

431
00:33:03,854 --> 00:33:05,455
I think there's a chance.

432
00:33:05,695 --> 00:33:07,414
I have to have a car.

433
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:08,174
such

434
00:33:08,174 --> 00:33:09,334
Let's start now.

435
00:33:09,334 --> 00:33:10,334
That car was the first one.

436
00:33:10,334 --> 00:33:12,255
From here to the sixth.

437
00:33:12,255 --> 00:33:13,654
Is your future car?

438
00:33:13,654 --> 00:33:14,414
Alright.

439
00:33:14,414 --> 00:33:14,935
The first one.

440
00:33:14,935 --> 00:33:16,255
This is good.

441
00:33:16,574 --> 00:33:17,975
The second one.

442
00:33:18,894 --> 00:33:19,374
The third one.

443
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:20,695
This is fine.

444
00:33:20,695 --> 00:33:21,215
The fourth one.

445
00:33:21,735 --> 00:33:22,374
Four rings.

446
00:33:22,374 --> 00:33:23,134
The fifth one.

447
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:23,654
The last one.

448
00:33:24,775 --> 00:33:25,854
It's a sports car.

449
00:33:25,854 --> 00:33:28,094
A sports car is OK.

450
00:33:28,094 --> 00:33:29,574
It seems I have to get rich in the future.

451
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:30,295
Don't worry!

452
00:33:30,295 --> 00:33:31,174
That's yours.

453
00:33:32,215 --> 00:33:33,055
Sanitation truck.

454
00:33:37,535 --> 00:33:39,535
Next stop, China Merchants Bank.

455
00:33:39,535 --> 00:33:41,255
China Merchants Bank, are we here?

456
00:33:43,055 --> 00:33:43,854
Get off the car

457
00:33:43,854 --> 00:33:44,414
Sit upside down.

458
00:33:44,854 --> 00:33:46,015
Sit upside down. Get off. Hurry up.

459
00:33:46,015 --> 00:33:46,854
Hurry up.

460
00:33:49,055 --> 00:33:50,215
It's too late.

461
00:33:50,215 --> 00:33:51,894
Get in the car.

462
00:33:51,894 --> 00:33:53,094
You two are leaving.

463
00:34:01,455 --> 00:34:04,134
Sorry, sorry.

464
00:34:07,574 --> 00:34:08,775
Please show me your tickets.

465
00:34:09,334 --> 00:34:11,134
We're here for the crossfire competition.

466
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:12,455
Take a look at the certificate.

467
00:34:15,735 --> 00:34:18,174
It's not with me, but with An Lan.

468
00:34:23,814 --> 00:34:25,735
Sir, can you stop the car?

469
00:34:25,735 --> 00:34:26,614
We have something urgent.

470
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:29,094
Where is this? Can you stop?

471
00:34:30,414 --> 00:34:31,495
We are here to compete.

472
00:34:31,495 --> 00:34:32,535
What certificate?

473
00:34:34,215 --> 00:34:35,015
Sorry

474
00:34:35,015 --> 00:34:36,535
We forgot to take the certificate.

475
00:34:36,535 --> 00:34:37,935
Can you please make an exception?

476
00:34:37,935 --> 00:34:39,015
We're a team of coins.

477
00:34:39,374 --> 00:34:41,134
We're from Ning Jiang Team.

478
00:34:41,134 --> 00:34:42,134
What team?

479
00:34:42,134 --> 00:34:42,975
The Coin Team.

480
00:34:43,174 --> 00:34:45,134
The Coin Team.

481
00:34:45,134 --> 00:34:46,055
That's where we are.

482
00:34:46,814 --> 00:34:47,775
And punished for cheating.

483
00:34:47,775 --> 00:34:49,574
The team that came to play the Inferno.

484
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:52,614
So it's you.

485
00:34:52,614 --> 00:34:53,695
Alright, go inside.

486
00:34:54,055 --> 00:34:55,094
Thank you.

487
00:34:55,814 --> 00:34:56,894
This way.

488
00:35:04,374 --> 00:35:05,614
Hello, we're the Coin Team.

489
00:35:06,775 --> 00:35:07,414
Thank you

490
00:35:17,535 --> 00:35:19,055
Are you kidding me?

491
00:35:19,654 --> 00:35:20,295
What is it?

492
00:35:21,374 --> 00:35:22,015
Sorry

493
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:22,894
Here.

494
00:35:23,295 --> 00:35:24,614
Excuse me, make way.

495
00:35:32,935 --> 00:35:33,574
Unicorn

496
00:35:33,574 --> 00:35:34,574
There's one behind the middle road.

497
00:35:34,574 --> 00:35:35,495
What did you say

498
00:35:36,295 --> 00:35:37,654
I said there's one behind the middle road.

499
00:35:37,654 --> 00:35:38,935
I can't hear you.

500
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:43,975
What are you doing?

501
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,414
Can I move this?

502
00:35:45,414 --> 00:35:46,334
I can't move it.

503
00:35:46,334 --> 00:35:47,015
Why?

504
00:35:47,015 --> 00:35:47,935
Can you turn it off?

505
00:35:47,935 --> 00:35:49,215
The music must be played.

506
00:35:49,215 --> 00:35:50,215
Are you going to fight or not?

507
00:35:56,255 --> 00:35:57,055
What did he say?

508
00:35:58,055 --> 00:35:59,174
Do you want to fight or not?

509
00:35:59,174 --> 00:35:59,975
Are you going to fight or not?

510
00:35:59,975 --> 00:36:01,055
What do you think?

511
00:36:07,295 --> 00:36:09,334
According to the arrangement of the competition committee tomorrow,

512
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,935
We are still sitting in the same place.

513
00:36:13,215 --> 00:36:14,455
You can't play this game.

514
00:36:14,455 --> 00:36:16,094
I'll turn the headset to the maximum.

515
00:36:16,094 --> 00:36:18,414
I can't hear you at all.

516
00:36:18,975 --> 00:36:20,735
It's not like this.

517
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:23,614
You will lose tomorrow.

518
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,614
I'll break the speaker tomorrow.

519
00:36:25,614 --> 00:36:26,614
rude

520
00:36:26,614 --> 00:36:27,255
What are you doing?

521
00:36:27,255 --> 00:36:28,814
We'll just pack up and leave.

522
00:36:29,055 --> 00:36:30,735
I'll talk to the competition committee again.

523
00:36:30,735 --> 00:36:32,134
It's useful.

524
00:36:32,134 --> 00:36:33,975
If it works, we'll be qualified today.

525
00:36:33,975 --> 00:36:34,455
We'll

526
00:36:34,854 --> 00:36:36,174
Can complaining solve the problem?

527
00:36:36,535 --> 00:36:37,854
Complaining can solve the problem.

528
00:36:37,854 --> 00:36:38,735
I'm here with you.

529
00:36:38,735 --> 00:36:39,935
You can scold me till dawn.

530
00:36:39,935 --> 00:36:41,414
We had difficulty in the competition.

531
00:36:41,414 --> 00:36:42,975
We can solve it in the training.

532
00:36:45,654 --> 00:36:47,055
I can't hear anything.

533
00:36:48,015 --> 00:36:49,374
Doesn't that mean you're blind?

534
00:36:50,094 --> 00:36:51,414
What about the competition tomorrow?

535
00:36:52,574 --> 00:36:54,174
Yang Guo broke an arm.

536
00:36:54,174 --> 00:36:55,735
Can be trained into the Sad Ecstasy Palm.

537
00:36:55,735 --> 00:36:56,975
What do you mean?

538
00:36:57,614 --> 00:36:59,535
Is to turn shortcomings into strengths.

539
00:36:59,535 --> 00:37:01,015
To turn a disadvantage into an advantage.

540
00:37:04,294 --> 00:37:05,335
Where is the nearest internet café?

541
00:37:13,694 --> 00:37:14,375
Music

542
00:37:19,415 --> 00:37:20,654
If you want to win tomorrow,

543
00:37:20,654 --> 00:37:22,055
You have to get used to the rhythm.

544
00:37:22,055 --> 00:37:23,935
Don't you all like to go to the disco?

545
00:37:23,935 --> 00:37:24,774
Take this place.

546
00:37:24,774 --> 00:37:26,654
As a competition in the hall.

547
00:37:27,055 --> 00:37:28,935
Follow the rhythm, right?

548
00:37:30,335 --> 00:37:31,335
Isn't it great?

549
00:37:31,654 --> 00:37:33,015
What are you looking at, Lao Sha?

550
00:37:33,015 --> 00:37:34,375
Don't you like to dance?

551
00:37:35,134 --> 00:37:36,055
Xiao Feng,

552
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:41,774
See that?

553
00:37:42,254 --> 00:37:43,254
See that?

554
00:37:46,614 --> 00:37:47,574
Is it interesting?

555
00:37:47,574 --> 00:37:48,574
Do you feel it?

556
00:37:49,654 --> 00:37:50,335
Do you feel it?

557
00:37:53,614 --> 00:37:54,734
It's interesting.

558
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,654
Sign in.

559
00:38:35,495 --> 00:38:36,015
Come on

560
00:38:36,415 --> 00:38:37,134
Come on

561
00:38:37,455 --> 00:38:38,214
Come on

562
00:38:38,495 --> 00:38:39,455
You know,

563
00:38:39,654 --> 00:38:41,535
Can they beat the opponent like this?

564
00:38:42,975 --> 00:38:44,815
They have to win today.

565
00:38:44,815 --> 00:38:46,815
I think it will be.

566
00:38:46,815 --> 00:38:48,094
I can do it without you.

567
00:38:49,614 --> 00:38:50,214
The Coin Team.

568
00:38:50,214 --> 00:38:50,855
Come on

569
00:40:26,574 --> 00:40:27,815
Lu Xiao Bei,

570
00:42:55,174 --> 00:42:56,415
Nice necklace.

571
00:42:57,774 --> 00:42:58,815
It's okay.

572
00:43:41,574 --> 00:43:42,815
To write a new song.

573
00:43:42,815 --> 00:43:44,335
Please give me more advice.

574
00:43:44,335 --> 00:43:45,214
I lost one on the path.

575
00:43:45,214 --> 00:43:46,055
One dead in the middle.

576
00:43:46,055 --> 00:43:46,895
There's one left.

577
00:43:48,294 --> 00:43:48,895
pretty

578
00:43:55,535 --> 00:43:57,134
Congratulations.

579
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:57,774
Dear teachers,

580
00:43:57,774 --> 00:43:58,574
It's not easy.

581
00:43:58,574 --> 00:43:59,654
The new song we wrote

582
00:44:01,015 --> 00:44:01,815
It's not easy for everyone.

583
00:44:01,815 --> 00:44:03,094
Listen to our song.

584
00:44:03,094 --> 00:44:03,855
A new song.

585
00:44:03,855 --> 00:44:04,455
Thank you.

586
00:44:05,335 --> 00:44:06,254
For a while

587
00:44:06,254 --> 00:44:07,574
On the stage.

588
00:44:07,574 --> 00:44:08,495
Yes

589
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:10,535
See you on the stage later.

590
00:44:10,975 --> 00:44:11,614
Come on.

591
00:44:21,975 --> 00:44:22,815
Hello, everyone.

592
00:44:22,815 --> 00:44:24,455
We are GALA.

593
00:44:24,455 --> 00:44:26,455
Let's perform this song.

594
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,254
I just wrote it last night.

595
00:44:28,254 --> 00:44:29,774
I haven't got a name yet.

596
00:44:29,774 --> 00:44:31,935
I hope you like it.

597
00:45:42,174 --> 00:45:44,174
Xiao Feng.

598
00:45:49,415 --> 00:45:50,654
Let's go for dinner.

599
00:45:51,055 --> 00:45:52,134
What are you doing?

600
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:46,815
I put my own hobby

601
00:47:46,815 --> 00:47:47,495
As a profession.

602
00:47:47,495 --> 00:47:48,654
As an ideal.

603
00:47:48,654 --> 00:47:50,214
What did I do wrong?

604
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:51,614
You'll be fine from now on.

605
00:47:51,614 --> 00:47:52,294
Stop fooling around.

606
00:47:52,294 --> 00:47:53,254
Look at yourself.

607
00:47:53,254 --> 00:47:54,294
Get a real job.

608
00:47:54,294 --> 00:47:55,335
Alright?

609
00:47:55,935 --> 00:47:57,094
My biggest wish

610
00:47:57,094 --> 00:47:58,975
Is to be with a group of people you like.

611
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,375
Doing what I love the most.

612
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:02,975
I canceled the registration for the National Challenge.

613
00:48:03,254 --> 00:48:04,015
I'm telling you,

614
00:48:04,015 --> 00:48:05,774
Do you know who I look down on the most?

615
00:48:05,774 --> 00:48:07,335
You know, the people on the street

616
00:48:07,335 --> 00:48:09,174
A young man without ambition.

617
00:48:09,455 --> 00:48:10,975
You're not young anymore.

618
00:48:11,574 --> 00:48:12,895
The game is your life.

619
00:48:12,895 --> 00:48:14,055
And my life.

620
00:48:14,055 --> 00:48:15,614
I shouldn't have been a coward.

621
00:48:15,614 --> 00:48:17,134
I shouldn't have given up halfway.

622
00:48:17,134 --> 00:48:18,614
You can play games well.

623
00:48:18,614 --> 00:48:20,535
Why is playing games not doing your job?

624
00:48:20,535 --> 00:48:22,774
You can play games and win the world championship, okay?

625
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:23,734
For Continental,

626
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:24,375
Come on

627
00:48:24,375 --> 00:48:28,895
And wins.

628
00:48:34,574 --> 00:48:35,815
I don't want to do.

629
00:48:35,815 --> 00:48:36,734
Can endure for a while.

630
00:48:36,734 --> 00:48:37,855
But I can't bear it for a lifetime.

631
00:48:37,855 --> 00:48:39,294
Love can't be hidden.

632
00:50:50,134 --> 00:50:50,815
one

633
00:50:51,495 --> 00:50:52,094
two

634
00:50:52,734 --> 00:50:53,654
three

635
00:51:02,774 --> 00:51:04,055
Our team was eliminated.

636
00:51:05,214 --> 00:51:06,134
It's all over.

637
00:51:06,774 --> 00:51:08,055
We didn't play well before.

638
00:51:08,055 --> 00:51:09,774
So I left my fate in the hands of others.

639
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,935
There are some things

640
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:13,254
No matter how hard we struggle,

641
00:51:13,614 --> 00:51:14,415
It's all in vain.

642
00:51:14,935 --> 00:51:15,815
Can't be changed.

643
00:51:16,134 --> 00:51:17,774
No one can fight forever.

644
00:51:19,094 --> 00:51:19,815
Xiao Feng.

645
00:51:20,254 --> 00:51:20,975
I'm kind of...

646
00:51:21,535 --> 00:51:22,654
I can't hold on.

647
00:51:25,455 --> 00:51:26,335
The Inferno.

648
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,574
Eleven teams.

649
00:51:27,574 --> 00:51:28,734
For a week.

650
00:51:28,734 --> 00:51:30,254
So that a team can advance.

651
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:32,055
You give me, I have no reason to stick to it.

652
00:51:32,495 --> 00:51:34,174
The game taught me

653
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,294
To do the right thing.

654
00:51:35,774 --> 00:51:37,055
Instead of something easy.

655
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,015
No matter how difficult the situation is,

656
00:51:39,654 --> 00:51:40,815
To make the right choice.

657
00:51:41,455 --> 00:51:42,694
There are only two words.

658
00:51:42,694 --> 00:51:43,415
regret

659
00:51:44,335 --> 00:51:45,055
That's a lifetime.

660
00:51:45,375 --> 00:51:46,415
You know,

661
00:51:46,415 --> 00:51:48,094
What is the greatest fun of playing games?

662
00:51:48,094 --> 00:51:49,975
You knew you would fail.

663
00:51:49,975 --> 00:51:51,614
But I keep trying.

664
00:51:54,614 --> 00:51:56,134
As long as it's something I want to do,

665
00:51:56,335 --> 00:51:57,495
Even if I hit my head,

666
00:51:57,495 --> 00:51:58,774
I won't give up.

667
00:51:59,495 --> 00:52:00,214
what?

668
00:52:00,574 --> 00:52:01,455
A big fight.

669
00:52:04,614 --> 00:52:05,574
In this world,

670
00:52:06,174 --> 00:52:07,174
There's no difficulty.

671
00:52:07,174 --> 00:52:08,455
You can stop Lu Xiao Bei.

672
00:52:09,015 --> 00:52:10,094
I'm not fooling around.

673
00:52:10,094 --> 00:52:11,254
I stick to my dream.

674
00:52:11,574 --> 00:52:12,654
It's really important to have dreams.

675
00:52:13,055 --> 00:52:14,535
It's really good to have a dream.

676
00:52:14,535 --> 00:52:15,694
Losing is not so horrible.

677
00:52:15,895 --> 00:52:17,094
Because of you,

678
00:52:17,094 --> 00:52:18,174
With my teammates,

679
00:52:18,174 --> 00:52:19,174
No matter how many times,

680
00:52:19,174 --> 00:52:20,574
I have the courage to continue.

681
00:52:21,254 --> 00:52:22,015
One day,

682
00:52:22,614 --> 00:52:23,815
The name of the Continue

683
00:52:24,254 --> 00:52:26,055
Will be engraved on the trophy of the world champion.
