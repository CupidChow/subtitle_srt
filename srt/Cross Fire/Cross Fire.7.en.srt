00:02:24,723 --> 00:02:25,443
Xiaobei

2
00:02:26,923 --> 00:02:28,643
Why are you so late?

3
00:02:29,088 --> 00:02:30,008
It's a great news.

4
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,168
Come here

5
00:02:31,168 --> 00:02:32,209
What good news?

6
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,088
Big news.

7
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:35,649
The country now officially

8
00:02:35,649 --> 00:02:37,208
As the 78th sports event.

9
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:39,368
What do you mean?

10
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:40,888
It means that people who play e-sports

11
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:42,528
Is a real professional athlete.

12
00:02:42,649 --> 00:02:44,329
Brother, you might be the one in the future.

13
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:45,528
professional

14
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:46,888
I have to talk to my parents

15
00:02:46,888 --> 00:02:47,728
Tell your classmates.

16
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:52,408
What is it?

17
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:53,808
Come and tell me about it.

18
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:56,128
See that?

19
00:02:56,728 --> 00:02:58,368
E-sports have become

20
00:02:58,368 --> 00:03:00,808
Item 78 Official Sports Events

21
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:02,609
The country has said that

22
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:04,329
This is a sport.

23
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:05,768
This is e-sports.

24
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:07,368
It's not an excuse.

25
00:03:10,688 --> 00:03:11,488
Now?

26
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:13,329
Depends on who can seize the chance.

27
00:03:14,808 --> 00:03:15,249
Unicorn

28
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,169
monkey

29
00:03:20,929 --> 00:03:21,448
Al-Amin

30
00:03:22,408 --> 00:03:23,609
I want to have a try.

31
00:03:23,928 --> 00:03:24,969
Don't try.

32
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:26,128
Who doesn't want to win the championship?

33
00:03:26,128 --> 00:03:27,488
National Challenge.

34
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,048
Just a few of us.

35
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,768
I'm afraid that Ning Jiang can't be defeated.

36
00:03:31,288 --> 00:03:31,848
No

37
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:34,048
The Internet café competition of the whole province

38
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:35,969
Who doesn't say that we are cannon fodder?

39
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:36,889
We're not doing it one by one.

40
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:38,089
To the final.

41
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:38,889
right or wrong?

42
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:40,208
Unicorn

43
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,288
Do you remember UP?

44
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:42,688
Was the best spy in the province.

45
00:03:43,688 --> 00:03:45,449
Three seconds in a row.

46
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:46,568
You're so popular.

47
00:03:46,568 --> 00:03:47,688
You were so manly back then.

48
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:49,609
a real man doesn't boast about his past achievements

49
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:51,208
Besides, the hero is old now.

50
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,928
Let's go fight with those kids.

51
00:03:53,089 --> 00:03:54,529
From reaction to speed,

52
00:03:54,529 --> 00:03:55,729
You're not a woman.

53
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:57,568
Do whatever you need to do.

54
00:03:58,128 --> 00:03:59,329
Those kids

55
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:00,048
The rice they ate

56
00:04:00,048 --> 00:04:01,288
It's not as salty as what we eat.

57
00:04:01,568 --> 00:04:03,169
As long as we are brothers,

58
00:04:03,488 --> 00:04:05,449
A stick is broken.

59
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:07,928
A handful of sticks.

60
00:04:12,488 --> 00:04:13,488
Stop it.

61
00:04:13,488 --> 00:04:13,688
Here, give it to me.

62
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:14,369
I can do it.

63
00:04:14,369 --> 00:04:15,648
Don't hurt your hands.

64
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:19,848
Brothers,

65
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:21,809
This is our last time

66
00:04:21,809 --> 00:04:22,729
The chance to turn the table.

67
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,089
Are we eating meat or soup this time?

68
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:26,648
This is the last time.

69
00:04:26,928 --> 00:04:27,928
There are only two words.

70
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,488
regret

71
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:31,289
That's a lifetime.

72
00:04:32,248 --> 00:04:34,129
Don't do such useless things.

73
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:35,329
I'm telling you,

74
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:37,569
The chicken soup for the soul can't fill your stomach.

75
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,528
Go back and do your serious work.

76
00:04:45,928 --> 00:04:46,609
Old rules

77
00:04:48,248 --> 00:04:49,528
There you go again.

78
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:52,048
win

79
00:04:52,368 --> 00:04:52,968
The winner.

80
00:05:09,248 --> 00:05:10,609
Do it again.

81
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:11,289
Come again.

82
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:15,129
See that?

83
00:05:15,768 --> 00:05:16,968
Are you doing magic?

84
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:22,248
no problem

85
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:24,768
If you don't believe me, you can try.

86
00:05:24,768 --> 00:05:25,368
I throw it.

87
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:31,849
See that?

88
00:05:32,528 --> 00:05:34,169
This is the power of the mind.

89
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:34,849
Come on.

90
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:35,569
I'll try.

91
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:50,528
Come on.

92
00:05:50,528 --> 00:05:51,449
One last time.

93
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:55,609
My coin.

94
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:21,289
See that?

95
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:23,248
This is the power of the mind.

96
00:06:23,368 --> 00:06:24,368
As long as you think about it,

97
00:06:24,928 --> 00:06:25,449
You can get

98
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:25,928
get

99
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:26,528
to want to

100
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:29,808
What's going on?

101
00:06:30,048 --> 00:06:31,129
Now I'm poor and penniless.

102
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:32,208
What are you doing?

103
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:34,088
If you worry about money,

104
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:36,608
I have

105
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:38,129
Where did you get so much money?

106
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:40,168
This is the fund my dad gave me.

107
00:06:40,489 --> 00:06:41,648
For holiday gifts.

108
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:43,768
Pops, you need to know I spent the money.

109
00:06:43,929 --> 00:06:44,608
Break my legs.

110
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:45,608
but

111
00:06:46,728 --> 00:06:48,049
Even if you break my leg,

112
00:06:48,648 --> 00:06:49,208
I'm going too.

113
00:06:49,608 --> 00:06:50,489
You want to gamble?

114
00:06:50,648 --> 00:06:52,168
The winner will get tens of thousands of yuan.

115
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,208
You have to bet.

116
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:54,728
Tens of thousands.

117
00:06:55,489 --> 00:06:56,009
Come on.

118
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:56,809
come

119
00:06:56,809 --> 00:06:57,648
Tens of thousands.

120
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:00,449
The Kirin.

121
00:07:01,408 --> 00:07:02,408
You can convince me.

122
00:07:02,848 --> 00:07:04,369
But you have to get that man back.

123
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:05,329
I will get him back.

124
00:07:05,608 --> 00:07:06,288
come

125
00:07:10,648 --> 00:07:11,968
For the bonus, for the honor,

126
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:16,049
And honor.

127
00:07:19,968 --> 00:07:21,848
The lower limb's vascular and nervous system

128
00:07:22,049 --> 00:07:23,528
Has shown signs of improvement.

129
00:07:23,528 --> 00:07:24,728
Especially the upper part of the femur.

130
00:07:25,088 --> 00:07:25,929
Look here.

131
00:07:25,929 --> 00:07:27,049
Although it's not obvious,

132
00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:28,608
But it's clearer than before.

133
00:07:31,168 --> 00:07:32,768
Doctor, are you saying that

134
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:34,449
Xiao Bei still has hope to stand up, right?

135
00:07:35,408 --> 00:07:36,968
Have you been doing

136
00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:37,848
Rehabilitation training

137
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,009
I was forced to do

138
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:41,009
That's why.

139
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:42,329
I've told you

140
00:07:42,608 --> 00:07:43,809
He might recover.

141
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:46,768
But the process will be long.

142
00:07:47,408 --> 00:07:48,809
And very painful.

143
00:07:49,049 --> 00:07:50,129
No matter how painful it is,

144
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:51,728
As long as I can cure him,

145
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:54,449
Yes, doctor.

146
00:07:54,728 --> 00:07:56,449
How should I use the medicine?

147
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:57,848
We will cooperate actively.

148
00:07:58,168 --> 00:08:00,369
The effect of the medicine is minimal.

149
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:02,848
Now I mainly insist on rehabilitation training.

150
00:08:03,528 --> 00:08:04,129
Now?

151
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:06,329
His physical pain is only one aspect.

152
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,329
But the hardest part is

153
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:10,129
Is to overcome the psychological barrier.

154
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:14,528
I'm used to a wheelchair.

155
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:16,689
He has no mental disorder.

156
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,049
Xiaobei

157
00:08:25,168 --> 00:08:26,009
Zhang Junyong

158
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:28,369
Chu song

159
00:08:36,608 --> 00:08:38,049
I'm so happy to get a 37.

160
00:08:38,288 --> 00:08:39,408
I was 16 last time.

161
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:40,848
I doubled it this time.

162
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:42,689
You are at the bottom of the class.

163
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:43,449
You should take care of it.

164
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:56,768
37 points.

165
00:08:57,049 --> 00:08:57,809
It's amazing.

166
00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:02,249
You're still so happy.

167
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:03,329
Of course.

168
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:05,329
I doubled it last time.

169
00:09:05,569 --> 00:09:06,528
On the Extent of Progress

170
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:08,009
The best in the class.

171
00:09:08,489 --> 00:09:09,408
Congratulations.

172
00:09:09,768 --> 00:09:12,049
The score has increased and the thickness of the skin has grown.

173
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,129
You're just jealous.

174
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:14,728
Your tolerance of yourself

175
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:16,049
Makes me jealous.

176
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:17,848
I won't argue with you this time.

177
00:09:19,088 --> 00:09:20,809
With our progress rate,

178
00:09:21,168 --> 00:09:23,528
I'll definitely catch up with the average grade next time.

179
00:09:24,168 --> 00:09:25,608
Now, with your level,

180
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:26,968
Go to the junior high school monthly exam.

181
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:28,288
I'll definitely be on 80.

182
00:09:31,768 --> 00:09:32,489
Chu song

183
00:09:32,929 --> 00:09:34,288
The director wants you to go to the office.

184
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:35,528
good

185
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:37,129
Come and take it.

186
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:38,889
Presentation

187
00:09:39,489 --> 00:09:40,208
Come in

188
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:43,449
This is yours.

189
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:46,009
Look at your grades.

190
00:09:46,408 --> 00:09:47,689
For three years in a row.

191
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:49,809
You've never reached the standard in the passed subjects.

192
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:51,608
And violated the school rules.

193
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:53,449
They grow flowers and plants in their minds.

194
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:54,689
You don't know anything.

195
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:56,009
The flowers grow grass.

196
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:57,288
It has some results.

197
00:09:57,809 --> 00:09:58,728
Now,

198
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:01,049
The college entrance examination is still a while away.

199
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,809
I have to talk to your parents

200
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:04,009
To have a talk.

201
00:10:04,408 --> 00:10:06,249
Get your parents here today.

202
00:10:24,168 --> 00:10:25,168
Who did this?

203
00:10:25,689 --> 00:10:26,889
Who did this?

204
00:10:27,408 --> 00:10:28,569
Who did this?

205
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:33,249
The wind is blowing.

206
00:10:34,288 --> 00:10:35,648
Alright, Chuge.

207
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:37,689
Wait until your parents come.

208
00:10:40,648 --> 00:10:41,728
You didn't take notes.

209
00:10:43,489 --> 00:10:44,408
That's amazing.

210
00:10:47,088 --> 00:10:48,088
What's wrong, monitor?

211
00:10:48,489 --> 00:10:49,689
Why did you take the Chu song?

212
00:10:49,689 --> 00:10:50,968
She just challenged the dean.

213
00:10:51,368 --> 00:10:53,008
The school seems to have dismissed her.

214
00:10:54,088 --> 00:10:54,848
Really?

215
00:10:55,008 --> 00:10:56,008
She's so bold.

216
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:57,728
What dare she do?

217
00:10:57,929 --> 00:10:59,569
You're good at sports,

218
00:10:59,569 --> 00:11:01,289
I really thought the school wouldn't fire her.

219
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:03,008
But her performance has just improved.

220
00:11:03,008 --> 00:11:04,088
I was fired.

221
00:11:04,088 --> 00:11:05,449
Is really unlucky.

222
00:11:07,248 --> 00:11:08,929
You want to go to a sports university?

223
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,329
I don't think the college entrance examination will be over this time.

224
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:12,248
Monitor

225
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:14,248
I think Chu Ge is pitiful.

226
00:11:14,248 --> 00:11:16,208
Why don't you go beg her?

227
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:17,409
I dare not.

228
00:11:17,848 --> 00:11:19,689
The dean is angry.

229
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:24,088
Chu song

230
00:11:31,848 --> 00:11:33,088
She's been here for two months.

231
00:11:33,088 --> 00:11:34,128
Back to the bottom.

232
00:11:35,088 --> 00:11:36,608
Sleep in class.

233
00:11:36,608 --> 00:11:38,248
Fighting after class.

234
00:11:38,248 --> 00:11:39,449
Break the rules.

235
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:41,728
Without a division,

236
00:11:42,248 --> 00:11:43,289
If I knew she was like this,

237
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:44,368
No matter how fast she runs,

238
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:45,368
I wouldn't even let her turn around.

239
00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:47,088
Your child

240
00:11:47,088 --> 00:11:48,569
We can't educate them.

241
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,689
Sign here.

242
00:11:50,888 --> 00:11:51,929
Take her home.

243
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:54,488
I'm sorry.

244
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:56,248
It's all because we didn't educate her.

245
00:11:56,488 --> 00:11:57,649
Sorry to trouble you.

246
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:58,128
Director

247
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:00,888
I was wrong.

248
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:01,689
She knew she was wrong.

249
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:02,809
She will definitely change.

250
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,728
Don't you want to change it?

251
00:12:05,248 --> 00:12:07,529
I invited you here to sign it.

252
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:08,248
other

253
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:09,929
Please give her another chance.

254
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,088
Actually, Chuge is bad-tempered.

255
00:12:12,088 --> 00:12:13,848
She's not the kind of child who doesn't learn well.

256
00:12:13,848 --> 00:12:15,088
She wants to study hard.

257
00:12:15,088 --> 00:12:16,728
She wants to study hard.

258
00:12:16,728 --> 00:12:18,689
The sun would have risen from the west.

259
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:20,449
Don't explain to me here.

260
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:22,649
I also follow the school rules.

261
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:24,008
Director, I was wrong.

262
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:25,289
Please give me another chance.

263
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:27,208
Now I know I was wrong.

264
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:29,488
It's too late.

265
00:12:29,488 --> 00:12:30,368
Why are you here?

266
00:12:30,368 --> 00:12:31,248
Get out of here.

267
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:32,049
Director

268
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:34,848
I'm here to accuse Chu Ge on behalf of the students.

269
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:36,689
Listen to this.

270
00:12:37,888 --> 00:12:38,728
And stare at me.

271
00:12:38,728 --> 00:12:39,569
Am I wrong?

272
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:40,769
The school wants to keep you.

273
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:42,208
It will give you a chance to reform.

274
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,569
To be a new man.

275
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:45,289
What are you talking about?

276
00:12:45,608 --> 00:12:46,289
No

277
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:48,208
Is the chance to study hard and improve every day.

278
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,088
Look what you have done.

279
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:52,968
You're bullying your classmates.

280
00:12:52,968 --> 00:12:53,929
When you enter society,

281
00:12:53,929 --> 00:12:55,208
You have to burn and rob them?

282
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,049
Stop at nothing in committing evils

283
00:12:56,888 --> 00:12:57,449
She hasn't arrived yet.

284
00:12:57,449 --> 00:12:58,049
Listen to me.

285
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,088
How nice of you.

286
00:13:00,248 --> 00:13:01,529
You kicked her for being showy.

287
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,449
Your Excellency, don't be so mean.

288
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:05,049
The director won't give up on you.

289
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:06,488
The director won't give up on you.

290
00:13:06,488 --> 00:13:07,569
Everyone hasn't given up on you.

291
00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:09,049
Why did you give up?

292
00:13:09,848 --> 00:13:11,608
Are you worthy of the director's efforts?

293
00:13:13,728 --> 00:13:14,569
I won't give up.

294
00:13:14,848 --> 00:13:15,649
I won't give up.

295
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:17,088
Yes, we promise.

296
00:13:17,289 --> 00:13:18,569
I won't do it again.

297
00:13:18,728 --> 00:13:19,848
Don't play the double reed for me.

298
00:13:19,848 --> 00:13:20,968
I'm not buying it.

299
00:13:21,088 --> 00:13:22,208
You won't sign it, right?

300
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:24,208
Based on the performance of Chuge since its transfer,

301
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:25,848
It's enough to persuade him to quit.

302
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,329
Chuge is not good.

303
00:13:30,689 --> 00:13:31,968
But the school knows that

304
00:13:31,968 --> 00:13:33,409
Our director has been teaching for many years.

305
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:35,569
I've never persuaded any bad students.

306
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:36,769
For three consecutive years.

307
00:13:36,888 --> 00:13:37,968
None of the candidates failed.

308
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,008
In the past,

309
00:13:39,008 --> 00:13:40,848
Can turn a bad student into a good one.

310
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:41,728
Now?

311
00:13:42,128 --> 00:13:43,769
Why don't you give Chu Ge another chance?

312
00:13:45,968 --> 00:13:47,409
I've been teaching for so many years.

313
00:13:47,848 --> 00:13:49,689
I've met any naughty student.

314
00:13:50,088 --> 00:13:51,968
I believe only teachers who can't teach,

315
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:53,289
There are no bad students.

316
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:54,929
But Chu Ge

317
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:56,409
She sent all the schools in Ningjiang

318
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:57,689
She read it all over.

319
00:13:57,689 --> 00:13:59,208
The results are all the way down.

320
00:13:59,208 --> 00:13:59,929
Besides sports,

321
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:01,809
She never passed.

322
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:04,008
There's no teaching in the school.

323
00:14:04,008 --> 00:14:05,409
But I won't accept it.

324
00:14:05,848 --> 00:14:07,008
People who are fooling around,

325
00:14:07,248 --> 00:14:07,728
Chu song

326
00:14:07,728 --> 00:14:08,529
Lu Xiao Bei,

327
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:09,329
Stop it.

328
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:10,449
Go back to the classroom.

329
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,088
You're not a study-loving master.

330
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:12,848
Stop talking nonsense.

331
00:14:13,128 --> 00:14:13,769
Stop talking nonsense.

332
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:14,208
I just...

333
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:16,888
And persuade him.

334
00:14:30,008 --> 00:14:30,728
The next monthly exam.

335
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,488
Chuge is below the grade average.

336
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:33,848
I dropped out with her.

337
00:14:49,608 --> 00:14:50,608
Why did you help me?

338
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:52,769
I don't know either

339
00:14:54,289 --> 00:14:55,248
It's getting worse.

340
00:14:56,769 --> 00:14:57,529
You know,

341
00:14:58,008 --> 00:14:59,728
Is it too late for me to take it back now?

342
00:15:00,888 --> 00:15:02,689
It's too late. The signature has been signed.

343
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:05,649
Impulse is the devil.

344
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:08,409
Why did I put myself in it?

345
00:15:10,488 --> 00:15:11,368
Brother,

346
00:15:11,848 --> 00:15:13,649
Can you not ruin the atmosphere?

347
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:15,329
You really touched me just now.

348
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:18,689
If you don't catch up with your GPA next month,

349
00:15:19,088 --> 00:15:20,449
Then I will be the scapegoat.

350
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,169
It's just a wrong.

351
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,368
It's good to be a loyal scapegoat.

352
00:15:25,488 --> 00:15:26,128
a row

353
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:28,128
From now on,

354
00:15:28,289 --> 00:15:29,728
We are in the same boat.

355
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:32,128
If you can't keep up with the average,

356
00:15:32,128 --> 00:15:33,008
I have to leave too.

357
00:15:33,848 --> 00:15:35,728
So even if you're desperate,

358
00:15:35,728 --> 00:15:36,728
You have to catch up with me.

359
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:37,248
Did you hear that?

360
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:38,529
I'll try my best.

361
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:39,689
Don't try.

362
00:15:39,968 --> 00:15:41,169
Yes, I must.

363
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:47,689
Let's go back to the classroom.

364
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:08,608
Where is the wrong answer?

365
00:16:12,128 --> 00:16:13,008
Stop looking. I have it.

366
00:16:13,368 --> 00:16:14,049
This is the only one.

367
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:15,409
not enough

368
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:16,968
At least 10 more.

369
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,449
I don't have so many wrong questions.

370
00:16:19,608 --> 00:16:20,728
From Grade 1 to now,

371
00:16:20,728 --> 00:16:21,929
I said there are ten books missing.

372
00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:23,208
Just like this exam paper,

373
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:24,888
Don't look at the 37 points.

374
00:16:24,888 --> 00:16:25,848
Keep your eyes on him.

375
00:16:25,848 --> 00:16:27,529
The 113 points you lost

376
00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:29,248
All the questions you did wrong,

377
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,728
All of them are copied from the wrong answers.

378
00:16:30,728 --> 00:16:32,128
Do it over and over again.

379
00:16:32,488 --> 00:16:33,488
Until you know it.

380
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:35,809
You're messing with me on purpose.

381
00:16:35,968 --> 00:16:37,008
It's done.

382
00:16:37,008 --> 00:16:38,289
You can get the grade average.

383
00:16:38,488 --> 00:16:39,368
The whole thing or not?

384
00:16:41,848 --> 00:16:43,608
The key is now more than two hundred days.

385
00:16:43,608 --> 00:16:45,529
Can I finish so many wrong questions?

386
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:49,608
The sweat on the eyebrow

387
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,208
And the tears under the eyebrow.

388
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:51,728
you

389
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:53,289
You can only choose one.

390
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:18,569
It's so late.

391
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:19,689
You haven't rested yet.

392
00:17:19,968 --> 00:17:21,049
I want to do a few more questions.

393
00:17:21,649 --> 00:17:22,689
That's right.

394
00:17:22,968 --> 00:17:23,929
I really hope

395
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:25,488
You can enter a good university.

396
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:27,289
You can leave this place.

397
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:28,088
Leaving Ningjiang.

398
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:29,368
Don't be like me.

399
00:17:29,368 --> 00:17:30,728
I've been chained here forever.

400
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:33,049
That's it.

401
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:34,649
What are you talking about?

402
00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:35,409
Is tied here.

403
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:36,968
Don't you have me?

404
00:17:38,248 --> 00:17:38,888
good

405
00:17:52,248 --> 00:17:52,888
Lighter

406
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:02,848
What are you doing?

407
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:08,368
Isn't this the paper you want to publish?

408
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:09,529
Why did you burn it?

409
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:10,409
It won't be published.

410
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:12,008
Don't you need it for the postgraduate exam?

411
00:18:13,569 --> 00:18:15,409
But my mentor said that the conditions

412
00:18:16,088 --> 00:18:17,409
I have to put his byline on the front.

413
00:18:17,608 --> 00:18:18,488
Add it.

414
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:19,488
Why is it so hard?

415
00:18:19,689 --> 00:18:21,449
This paper has nothing to do with him.

416
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:22,449
I can't add it.

417
00:18:23,888 --> 00:18:24,728
I'm telling you,

418
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,049
You're stubborn.

419
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:27,689
Add your name to the instructor.

420
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:28,888
He took care of your postgraduate exam.

421
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,128
This is not the best of both worlds.

422
00:18:30,128 --> 00:18:31,449
To push the boat along?

423
00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:33,848
There are many such things in society.

424
00:18:34,088 --> 00:18:35,088
Interest exchange

425
00:18:35,088 --> 00:18:36,088
Each takes what he needs

426
00:18:36,329 --> 00:18:38,208
But common things are not always right.

427
00:18:38,608 --> 00:18:39,529
You might think I'm reading,

428
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:40,809
And ruined my brain.

429
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:42,409
But I don't think we can do this.

430
00:18:48,608 --> 00:18:50,049
If he can cheat,

431
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:51,368
Then it's meaningless for me to go to graduate school.

432
00:18:51,368 --> 00:18:52,449
What can we do?

433
00:18:52,848 --> 00:18:54,449
You can't lock me from the game.

434
00:18:58,368 --> 00:18:59,769
You didn't sign it for him.

435
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:01,128
When the exam comes,

436
00:19:01,128 --> 00:19:02,088
He will brush it down for you.

437
00:19:02,329 --> 00:19:03,689
I believe that no matter how difficult the situation is,

438
00:19:03,888 --> 00:19:05,569
And make the right choice.

439
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:06,809
Then what do you choose?

440
00:19:07,888 --> 00:19:08,809
I'm not going to graduate.

441
00:19:09,888 --> 00:19:11,049
Get a job first.

442
00:19:11,329 --> 00:19:12,049
I'm telling you,

443
00:19:12,248 --> 00:19:13,569
The fame of your school

444
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:15,888
It takes only a minute for you to find a job in a foreign company.

445
00:19:18,088 --> 00:19:20,208
I heard you resigned and reorganized your team.

446
00:19:20,449 --> 00:19:21,769
Your family doesn't object.

447
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:23,809
I'm just self-willed.

448
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:25,809
Didn't you say that?

449
00:19:26,209 --> 00:19:27,209
No matter how difficult the situation is,

450
00:19:27,969 --> 00:19:29,168
To make the right choice.

451
00:19:29,688 --> 00:19:30,769
But your former teammates

452
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:31,969
Are they willing to come back?

453
00:19:35,569 --> 00:19:36,769
I'm the only one left.

454
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:37,969
Get him back.

455
00:19:38,128 --> 00:19:39,128
He ignored me.

456
00:19:40,249 --> 00:19:42,368
Don't you have the nerve to go to her?

457
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:45,289
Look.

458
00:19:45,648 --> 00:19:46,888
How many times have I called him?

459
00:19:46,888 --> 00:19:48,009
How many messages have you sent?

460
00:19:48,009 --> 00:19:48,928
He just ignored me.

461
00:19:49,128 --> 00:19:49,888
What should I do?

462
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:51,289
I almost knelt down for him.

463
00:19:51,688 --> 00:19:52,809
I'll ask him out for you.

464
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:55,809
As a man,

465
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,088
It will lose more noodles.

466
00:19:57,408 --> 00:19:59,128
So the dream is important.

467
00:19:59,928 --> 00:20:00,928
Face is important.

468
00:20:07,368 --> 00:20:08,809
I'll draw fire. Outflank him.

469
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:09,289
good

470
00:20:37,928 --> 00:20:38,408
Lieutenant

471
00:20:38,848 --> 00:20:40,049
Don't shoot. It's me.

472
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:44,848
Why are you here?

473
00:20:45,088 --> 00:20:46,329
Dynasty Team is not for you.

474
00:20:46,569 --> 00:20:47,088
Come back.

475
00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:49,888
Leave.

476
00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:52,489
When they hit you.

477
00:20:52,489 --> 00:20:53,408
It's not pretty.

478
00:20:53,688 --> 00:20:54,529
As long as you come back,

479
00:20:54,729 --> 00:20:55,729
It doesn't matter if it's pretty or not.

480
00:20:57,249 --> 00:20:58,168
Don't you understand human language?

481
00:20:58,168 --> 00:20:58,928
Go away

482
00:21:06,729 --> 00:21:07,809
Brothers,

483
00:21:09,128 --> 00:21:09,969
I'm sorry.

484
00:21:10,688 --> 00:21:12,329
I'm not here to cause trouble.

485
00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:13,888
Xu Wei is my man.

486
00:21:14,168 --> 00:21:14,888
today

487
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:17,569
Xiao Feng can't fight back.

488
00:21:17,888 --> 00:21:19,009
If you scold me or not,

489
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:21,209
Do whatever you want to me.

490
00:21:21,209 --> 00:21:21,928
but

491
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,688
I'm only doing one thing today.

492
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:26,569
That's to take my brother Xu Wei

493
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,088
Return to the army

494
00:21:31,489 --> 00:21:32,168
Lieutenant

495
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:34,888
Do you remember?

496
00:21:36,848 --> 00:21:38,368
The day we met,

497
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:41,408
In such an internet café.

498
00:21:42,608 --> 00:21:44,249
On this ship.

499
00:21:44,648 --> 00:21:46,329
We played as a team for several days and nights.

500
00:21:46,329 --> 00:21:47,368
I don't remember.

501
00:21:48,969 --> 00:21:50,569
But I only remember two words.

502
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:52,769
Heartily

503
00:21:54,928 --> 00:21:56,249
Since that day,

504
00:21:57,408 --> 00:21:58,969
We hang out every day.

505
00:22:00,128 --> 00:22:02,329
You can eat and sleep together.

506
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:03,809
Never separated.

507
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:06,688
The game is your life.

508
00:22:07,408 --> 00:22:08,688
And my life.

509
00:22:10,448 --> 00:22:11,408
Some time ago,

510
00:22:12,368 --> 00:22:14,009
I lost my life because I was crazy.

511
00:22:14,729 --> 00:22:15,729
It's my fault.

512
00:22:17,368 --> 00:22:18,448
I am sorry

513
00:22:19,848 --> 00:22:21,249
As long as you come back,

514
00:22:21,249 --> 00:22:22,888
I'll do whatever you want.

515
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,009
What's wrong with you?

516
00:22:26,489 --> 00:22:28,368
I shouldn't have dismissed the team.

517
00:22:28,969 --> 00:22:30,529
I shouldn't have broken the trophy.

518
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:32,408
I shouldn't have been a coward.

519
00:22:32,688 --> 00:22:34,249
I shouldn't have given up halfway.

520
00:22:34,489 --> 00:22:36,249
You shouldn't have failed me, Xu Wei.

521
00:22:37,729 --> 00:22:39,529
I shouldn't have failed you, Xu Wei.

522
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:41,368
It's so disgusting.

523
00:22:46,888 --> 00:22:48,688
Who is the best player of the team?

524
00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:50,569
You're the best player of the team.

525
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:51,769
Whose gun is the toughest?

526
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:53,009
Your gun is the toughest.

527
00:22:53,448 --> 00:22:54,928
Whose tactics are the best?

528
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:56,489
My tactics are the best.

529
00:22:56,489 --> 00:22:57,809
Who is the most handsome?

530
00:22:58,329 --> 00:22:59,128
I'm the most handsome.

531
00:22:59,329 --> 00:22:59,928
who

532
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,289
you

533
00:23:05,088 --> 00:23:05,809
Come out.

534
00:23:06,168 --> 00:23:06,969
Kneel down.

535
00:23:07,848 --> 00:23:09,368
You said to me every word.

536
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:11,249
Xiao Feng can't be without Xu Wei.

537
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:14,009
I'm the most important person in your life.

538
00:23:19,329 --> 00:23:20,888
I'm Xiao Feng.

539
00:23:24,408 --> 00:23:25,648
I can't be without Xiao Feng.

540
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:30,128
I can't kneel.

541
00:23:30,529 --> 00:23:32,648
This is too cheesy. I can't say it.

542
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:36,128
Say it.

543
00:24:23,209 --> 00:24:25,448
Xiao Feng can't be without you, Xu Wei.

544
00:24:26,928 --> 00:24:28,969
You are the most important person in my life.

545
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:40,128
I can't stand it.

546
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:41,009
Give me the grenade.

547
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:43,168
Blow up two tortoise grandchildren.

548
00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:06,009
117067790

549
00:26:06,489 --> 00:26:07,128
Su Jiayi.

550
00:26:07,648 --> 00:26:08,448
Where's your ID card?

551
00:26:08,529 --> 00:26:09,249
Give it to me.

552
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:10,769
I'll do it myself.

553
00:26:12,088 --> 00:26:13,009
You are not allowed to peep.

554
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:14,969
Hurry up. The committee will review it.

555
00:26:15,209 --> 00:26:16,009
The teams that signed up this year

556
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:17,368
More than double that of last year.

557
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:18,769
If you're late, you'll fall behind.

558
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:19,769
The default team

559
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:21,088
Who played semi-professional league last year.

560
00:26:22,168 --> 00:26:22,969
Stop playing.

561
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:26,209
Do you know the Langya League?

562
00:26:26,569 --> 00:26:27,608
The Langya League.

563
00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:29,489
The Langya Alliance is amazing.

564
00:26:29,489 --> 00:26:30,809
Is the absolute master of our team.

565
00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:31,569
Wait

566
00:26:31,969 --> 00:26:33,049
Look what I found.

567
00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:35,168
Isn't this the King of Gravity?

568
00:26:35,329 --> 00:26:36,809
Why did he go to the Cultivator?

569
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:37,448
Yes

570
00:26:37,448 --> 00:26:39,608
The hottest new player in the professional league.

571
00:26:39,608 --> 00:26:40,969
What's wrong with the new king?

572
00:26:40,969 --> 00:26:42,168
I'll still kill him.

573
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:43,529
ambitious

574
00:26:44,088 --> 00:26:45,088
Then I want to see

575
00:26:45,088 --> 00:26:46,209
How are you going to kill him?

576
00:26:46,489 --> 00:26:47,049
a row

577
00:26:48,688 --> 00:26:50,289
King has entered the gravity.

578
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:51,608
You won't play in the professional league.

579
00:26:51,608 --> 00:26:52,809
Why are you here?

580
00:26:52,928 --> 00:26:53,608
Xiaobei

581
00:26:53,928 --> 00:26:55,569
You had a problem with him.

582
00:26:55,569 --> 00:26:56,848
This is not a good time.

583
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,769
We are the ones here.

584
00:27:02,088 --> 00:27:03,408
This is more interesting.

585
00:27:04,888 --> 00:27:05,769
You've been here for so long.

586
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:07,729
There's finally a place I can live in.

587
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:10,569
This is the best cyber cafe in Ningjiang.

588
00:27:10,569 --> 00:27:12,608
There are the best masters in Ning Jiang.

589
00:27:13,688 --> 00:27:15,408
If you want to practice operation and marksmanship,

590
00:27:15,408 --> 00:27:16,848
You have to fight with a great master.

591
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,009
Let's go.

592
00:27:36,249 --> 00:27:36,888
Why are you so late?

593
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:38,009
Don't waste time.

594
00:27:38,009 --> 00:27:38,888
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

595
00:27:38,888 --> 00:27:39,608
Xiaobei

596
00:27:40,209 --> 00:27:40,809
Look.

597
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:44,209
you

598
00:27:52,289 --> 00:27:52,809
Are they alike?

599
00:27:55,608 --> 00:27:56,168
ID

600
00:27:56,168 --> 00:27:56,569
fast

601
00:27:56,569 --> 00:27:57,368
hurry up

602
00:27:58,128 --> 00:27:58,809
This is the story.

603
00:27:59,249 --> 00:28:01,249
This internet café must have my dad's spy.

604
00:28:01,489 --> 00:28:03,489
So Lu Xiao Bei can't be here.

605
00:28:03,688 --> 00:28:05,729
But Zhang Bobo can.

606
00:28:07,209 --> 00:28:08,009
I'm

607
00:28:08,009 --> 00:28:08,809
Zhang Bobo

608
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,289
Bobo

609
00:28:11,408 --> 00:28:12,209
Zhang Bobo

610
00:28:12,688 --> 00:28:13,368
Bobo sauce.

611
00:28:15,648 --> 00:28:16,329
Set out

612
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:18,249
I'll call you tonight.

613
00:28:20,329 --> 00:28:21,009
Lihai

614
00:28:22,088 --> 00:28:23,009
Su Jiayi.

615
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:24,569
WangKai

616
00:28:25,209 --> 00:28:25,969
ChengHao

617
00:28:26,608 --> 00:28:27,329
Zhang Bobo

618
00:28:29,368 --> 00:28:30,088
Here you are.

619
00:28:32,088 --> 00:28:32,888
You can go in now.

620
00:28:45,249 --> 00:28:46,209
There's an empty room.

621
00:28:46,489 --> 00:28:47,489
Hurry up.

622
00:28:52,688 --> 00:28:53,848
Look, the man with a muzzle.

623
00:28:53,848 --> 00:28:54,888
It's a war.

624
00:28:54,888 --> 00:28:56,009
And the one with the mouse in his left hand.

625
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:56,848
Is Winner 5.

626
00:28:56,848 --> 00:28:58,648
My God, it's all Daniel.

627
00:28:58,648 --> 00:28:59,688
Things seldom seen are strange

628
00:28:59,688 --> 00:29:01,049
You've made a great man of everything.

629
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:02,249
We have to defeat this place.

630
00:29:02,249 --> 00:29:03,688
99% of the players

631
00:29:04,489 --> 00:29:05,648
To become a hundred cities.

632
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:07,448
The one percent of survivors

633
00:29:07,608 --> 00:29:08,489
Don't wait.

634
00:29:08,489 --> 00:29:09,809
Let's find a Niudian team.

635
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:11,329
It's not for nothing.

636
00:29:15,489 --> 00:29:17,368
Do you think you can practice it?

637
00:29:17,368 --> 00:29:18,249
A challenge.

638
00:29:31,209 --> 00:29:31,848
He's here.

639
00:29:39,128 --> 00:29:40,049
Who are you?

640
00:29:41,569 --> 00:29:42,928
Can you read?

641
00:29:42,928 --> 00:29:44,329
To dominate the firing line.

642
00:29:44,608 --> 00:29:45,648
We wrapped it.

643
00:29:46,329 --> 00:29:46,769
we

644
00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:47,608
In the wrong room.

645
00:29:47,608 --> 00:29:48,448
This is a private room.

646
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,809
Who dares to rob anyone's bag?

647
00:29:51,128 --> 00:29:52,289
Go away.

648
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:53,289
Can you speak?

649
00:29:54,088 --> 00:29:55,088
Let's try one.

650
00:29:56,289 --> 00:29:57,448
Say it again.

651
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:00,289
Show me how to go.

652
00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:02,049
calm

653
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:04,049
Fighting and fighting, that's what hooligans do.

654
00:30:04,049 --> 00:30:05,049
We're not hooligans.

655
00:30:05,049 --> 00:30:06,049
Are you serious?

656
00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:06,928
I'm

657
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:10,729
Who are you?

658
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,088
Zhang Bobo

659
00:30:12,888 --> 00:30:14,608
It's you, Zhang Bobo.

660
00:30:18,809 --> 00:30:20,608
Don't be angry

661
00:30:20,608 --> 00:30:22,408
Don't be angry

662
00:30:23,009 --> 00:30:26,168
To stay angry with the devil.

663
00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:28,888
Don't be angry

664
00:30:29,249 --> 00:30:30,928
Don't be angry

665
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:31,928
Five brothers.

666
00:30:32,368 --> 00:30:33,769
We are reasonable people.

667
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:34,809
such

668
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:35,769
Let's drive.

669
00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:36,888
The winner stays.

670
00:30:37,408 --> 00:30:38,128
The loser will leave.

671
00:30:38,368 --> 00:30:39,249
You two.

672
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:41,648
Who cares?

673
00:30:41,648 --> 00:30:44,569
Don't be angry with yourself.

674
00:30:45,608 --> 00:30:46,329
Xiaobei

675
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:48,569
I've asked around about this room.

676
00:30:48,569 --> 00:30:49,608
600 yuan an hour.

677
00:30:49,928 --> 00:30:50,928
We won't be able to afford it.

678
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,168
Does it have anything to do with money?

679
00:30:52,368 --> 00:30:53,249
No matter what,

680
00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:54,769
We all have to win.

681
00:30:55,128 --> 00:30:55,848
WangKai

682
00:30:56,569 --> 00:30:57,569
You'll be good at it later.

683
00:30:58,049 --> 00:30:59,329
What's wrong with your attitude?

684
00:30:59,688 --> 00:31:00,848
I thought so too.

685
00:31:23,729 --> 00:31:24,368
Where are they?

686
00:31:24,569 --> 00:31:25,368
It's already dead.

687
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:26,128
Go to the middle.

688
00:31:26,329 --> 00:31:26,888
good

689
00:31:27,088 --> 00:31:27,969
One fell off the bridge.

690
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:29,249
Two more went to the middle gate.

691
00:31:29,448 --> 00:31:29,888
Received

692
00:31:38,368 --> 00:31:39,648
This is an elite team.

693
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:41,289
A bunch of bumpkins.

694
00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:53,448
Bobo's shot just now

695
00:31:54,168 --> 00:31:54,848
Is it strong?

696
00:31:55,168 --> 00:31:56,009
A little something.

697
00:32:14,688 --> 00:32:15,969
And tortured the vegetables.

698
00:32:18,329 --> 00:32:18,928
Kiwifruit

699
00:32:19,928 --> 00:32:20,888
Do you have your brain?

700
00:32:22,448 --> 00:32:23,368
Say it again.

701
00:32:24,529 --> 00:32:25,729
You brought

702
00:32:25,729 --> 00:32:27,688
Otherwise, who's brain I just shot?

703
00:32:30,969 --> 00:32:32,049
Don't touch me.

704
00:32:34,009 --> 00:32:34,769
You want to fight?

705
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:35,249
Come on.

706
00:32:35,249 --> 00:32:35,608
Don't move.

707
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:36,848
Boss is here.

708
00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:37,408
You want to fight?

709
00:32:37,408 --> 00:32:37,888
Release

710
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,209
Come on.

711
00:32:38,209 --> 00:32:39,049
Stop!

712
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:39,928
What are you doing

713
00:32:41,769 --> 00:32:42,448
What are you doing

714
00:32:42,688 --> 00:32:44,249
Boss Luo, you're here at the right time.

715
00:32:44,969 --> 00:32:46,608
These people broke your rules.

716
00:32:49,608 --> 00:32:50,249
Get out

717
00:32:50,448 --> 00:32:51,009
Did you hear that?

718
00:32:51,368 --> 00:32:52,128
Get out

719
00:32:52,648 --> 00:32:53,608
I'm talking about you.

720
00:32:53,608 --> 00:32:54,368
Get out

721
00:32:55,128 --> 00:32:55,729
I

722
00:32:56,408 --> 00:32:57,928
I'm your VIP member.

723
00:32:58,289 --> 00:32:59,128
I'm warning you.

724
00:32:59,969 --> 00:33:01,329
You can make trouble.

725
00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:03,049
But not in my place.

726
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:04,648
Do it if you want to.

727
00:33:04,928 --> 00:33:06,209
Where do you think I am?

728
00:33:06,969 --> 00:33:07,529
Get out

729
00:33:08,128 --> 00:33:09,209
Don't let me see you again.

730
00:33:09,329 --> 00:33:11,168
Take the bag and leave.

731
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:13,088
bye-bye

732
00:33:13,688 --> 00:33:14,648
Don't.

733
00:33:27,729 --> 00:33:29,529
I really didn't know you opened this internet cafe.

734
00:33:30,569 --> 00:33:31,769
Sorry to trouble you.

735
00:33:31,769 --> 00:33:32,368
Brother Yang.

736
00:33:35,088 --> 00:33:36,489
From now on, this room will be yours.

737
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:38,249
You need food and drink.

738
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:39,249
The front desk will get it.

739
00:33:41,009 --> 00:33:42,448
Can you stop wearing that wig?

740
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:43,729
I have a surveillance camera here.

741
00:33:46,928 --> 00:33:47,569
That

742
00:33:48,128 --> 00:33:48,928
You know that.

743
00:33:49,608 --> 00:33:51,688
We can't afford your VIP membership.

744
00:33:52,408 --> 00:33:53,769
I didn't mean to take advantage of you.

745
00:33:54,009 --> 00:33:55,088
Since I have it,

746
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,769
You have to give me a grade.

747
00:33:57,289 --> 00:33:58,009
Can you do that?

748
00:34:03,368 --> 00:34:04,448
I want to be the champion.

749
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:07,769
I want to finish what you didn't finish.

750
00:34:20,209 --> 00:34:20,809
Work hard.

751
00:34:23,648 --> 00:34:24,489
Brother Xie Yang.

752
00:34:27,729 --> 00:34:28,969
Do you know that brother?

753
00:34:29,688 --> 00:34:30,489
His name is Luo Yang.

754
00:34:31,209 --> 00:34:32,489
Was my brother's former teammate.

755
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:33,888
Luoyang

756
00:34:34,529 --> 00:34:35,888
The legendary Luoyang.

757
00:34:36,888 --> 00:34:38,569
He and your brother were the ones

758
00:34:38,888 --> 00:34:39,809
Team Sky.

759
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:41,209
So as to dominate the whole Ning River.

760
00:34:43,128 --> 00:34:44,088
But later,

761
00:34:44,448 --> 00:34:45,168
Then what happened?

762
00:34:45,688 --> 00:34:46,569
Nothing else.

763
00:34:47,809 --> 00:34:48,928
After my brother's accident,

764
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:50,329
The team will be scattered.

765
00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:51,529
Before, Team Sky of Dragon Boat

766
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:53,489
He has the best relationship with my brother.

767
00:34:53,809 --> 00:34:54,928
You're always eating in my home.

768
00:34:55,729 --> 00:34:56,809
Then my brother died.

769
00:34:58,209 --> 00:34:59,329
He never came here again.

770
00:35:00,448 --> 00:35:01,608
Then let him sponsor us.

771
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:02,809
When we're popular,

772
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,769
To increase the popularity of the internet café.

773
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:05,888
And divide it with them.

774
00:35:06,489 --> 00:35:07,608
Don't push your luck.

775
00:35:08,329 --> 00:35:09,408
Brother Yang said that

776
00:35:09,688 --> 00:35:10,569
This private room

777
00:35:10,729 --> 00:35:11,769
Give it to us for free.

778
00:35:13,168 --> 00:35:13,969
The premise is that

779
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:15,448
To achieve success,

780
00:35:15,569 --> 00:35:16,489
So practice hard.

781
00:35:17,049 --> 00:35:18,088
Don't embarrass her.

782
00:35:18,088 --> 00:35:19,249
Don't embarrass ourselves.

783
00:35:19,249 --> 00:35:20,049
good

784
00:35:25,769 --> 00:35:26,408
monkey

785
00:35:26,408 --> 00:35:28,408
Let's play games like this every day.

786
00:35:28,688 --> 00:35:29,969
If you come home late,

787
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:32,128
Will your wife have a problem with it?

788
00:35:33,249 --> 00:35:34,329
Make fun of

789
00:35:34,648 --> 00:35:36,448
How dare I dare her?

790
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:41,049
Every time I came back late,

791
00:35:41,049 --> 00:35:42,529
She has to make the midnight snack.

792
00:35:42,529 --> 00:35:43,648
Put it on the table and wait for me.

793
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:46,088
The family status is high.

794
00:35:46,448 --> 00:35:47,368
of course

795
00:35:47,368 --> 00:35:48,209
If you can't finish it,

796
00:35:48,209 --> 00:35:49,489
We will go to your house for a while.

797
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:51,088
Tell me before you go.

798
00:35:51,088 --> 00:35:52,489
And add two more dishes.

799
00:35:52,848 --> 00:35:53,848
We didn't say hello.

800
00:35:53,848 --> 00:35:55,408
We'll attack him.

801
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,249
They're here.

802
00:36:02,608 --> 00:36:03,688
You're a bunch of kids again.

803
00:36:03,688 --> 00:36:05,128
I'm a kindergarten killer.

804
00:36:05,128 --> 00:36:06,529
I'm...

805
00:36:07,009 --> 00:36:09,049
Through the fire, childhood dream-breakers.

806
00:36:09,408 --> 00:36:11,489
I'm Young Dream Tear.

807
00:36:12,888 --> 00:36:13,569
Fight a quick battle to force a quick decision

808
00:36:13,569 --> 00:36:14,088
Yes

809
00:36:14,209 --> 00:36:15,648
Come on

810
00:36:15,848 --> 00:36:16,888
What are you talking about?

811
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:17,809
You scared me.

812
00:36:18,049 --> 00:36:19,049
You scared me.

813
00:36:19,168 --> 00:36:20,408
frightened

814
00:36:22,209 --> 00:36:22,928
Kirin, don't panic.

815
00:36:22,928 --> 00:36:23,448
We went to knife him.

816
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:24,969
Cover for Xiao Feng.

817
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:25,769
You know,

818
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:26,289
Hold still

819
00:36:26,368 --> 00:36:26,729
retreat

820
00:36:26,729 --> 00:36:27,049
fall

821
00:36:27,968 --> 00:36:28,368
what

822
00:36:28,368 --> 00:36:29,289
I'll listen to anything.

823
00:36:34,848 --> 00:36:35,289
Where is the cover?

824
00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:36,089
Hold still

825
00:36:37,048 --> 00:36:37,488
Down

826
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:38,209
You won.

827
00:36:50,289 --> 00:36:51,048
Be steady.

828
00:36:51,249 --> 00:36:51,888
monkey

829
00:36:51,888 --> 00:36:52,488
Stuck on the path.

830
00:36:52,488 --> 00:36:53,209
Watch your back.

831
00:36:53,209 --> 00:36:53,848
hurry up

832
00:36:53,848 --> 00:36:54,609
B The door is sealed.

833
00:36:55,008 --> 00:36:55,609
Kirin,

834
00:36:55,609 --> 00:36:56,249
I just killed one.

835
00:37:00,888 --> 00:37:01,528
on

836
00:37:01,968 --> 00:37:02,249
Here, I threw the cigarette.

837
00:37:02,249 --> 00:37:02,528
Al-Amin

838
00:37:03,129 --> 00:37:03,329
Anbao

839
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:04,488
Cover for Xiao Feng.

840
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:05,089
Don't hit me.

841
00:37:05,488 --> 00:37:06,169
Someone is coming.

842
00:37:06,968 --> 00:37:07,609
Where is the monkey?

843
00:37:07,609 --> 00:37:08,729
Where is Monkey Middle Road?

844
00:37:08,928 --> 00:37:10,209
Where's my husband Monkey?

845
00:37:11,368 --> 00:37:12,408
It's not time yet. What are you doing?

846
00:37:14,689 --> 00:37:15,368
Stop right there.

847
00:37:17,209 --> 00:37:18,488
You can't stay at home.

848
00:37:18,649 --> 00:37:19,129
overtime

849
00:37:19,129 --> 00:37:20,649
To the internet café, right?

850
00:37:20,928 --> 00:37:23,249
You play games with these scoundrel.

851
00:37:23,249 --> 00:37:24,488
The more I play, the more useless I am.

852
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:25,568
Go home.

853
00:37:25,928 --> 00:37:26,568
Brothers,

854
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:27,769
To handle small matters.

855
00:37:28,649 --> 00:37:29,249
Let's go first.

856
00:37:30,129 --> 00:37:30,689
go

857
00:37:31,129 --> 00:37:31,649
Sister-in-law

858
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:32,568
Stay there.

859
00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:35,689
You didn't answer his calls.

860
00:37:35,689 --> 00:37:37,249
Is the monkey locked up by his wife?

861
00:37:37,249 --> 00:37:38,008
Why not?

862
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:38,408
impossible

863
00:37:38,408 --> 00:37:39,289
Why not?

864
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:40,488
It's not like you haven't seen it.

865
00:37:40,488 --> 00:37:41,928
The way his wife acted yesterday,

866
00:37:42,129 --> 00:37:43,129
You're acting like a monkey.

867
00:37:43,689 --> 00:37:44,408
monkey

868
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,129
Brothers,

869
00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:49,129
Sorry

870
00:37:49,129 --> 00:37:50,448
You'll be late. It's okay.

871
00:37:50,448 --> 00:37:52,169
Pay attention to the training next time. Let's go.

872
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:53,329
There's probably no next time.

873
00:37:54,848 --> 00:37:55,528
It's not you, Big Man.

874
00:37:55,528 --> 00:37:56,809
Why are you mumbling?

875
00:37:56,809 --> 00:37:57,968
You have something to say.

876
00:37:58,249 --> 00:37:59,769
Anyway, you all know that

877
00:37:59,769 --> 00:38:00,729
I also watched it that time.

878
00:38:02,089 --> 00:38:02,809
You...

879
00:38:06,089 --> 00:38:06,609
You...

880
00:38:10,809 --> 00:38:12,488
That's amazing.

881
00:38:15,769 --> 00:38:16,968
It's so big.

882
00:38:17,249 --> 00:38:17,729
Yes

883
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:18,809
This is too strong.

884
00:38:18,888 --> 00:38:19,408
You...

885
00:38:19,528 --> 00:38:20,329
How did you do that?

886
00:38:20,329 --> 00:38:21,368
Yes, how did you do that?

887
00:38:21,368 --> 00:38:22,649
Who hurt you so badly?

888
00:38:25,568 --> 00:38:26,408
My wife.

889
00:38:27,729 --> 00:38:28,848
Your wife.

890
00:38:30,448 --> 00:38:32,289
Your wife loves you, I think.

891
00:38:32,649 --> 00:38:33,649
You bit so hard.

892
00:38:33,649 --> 00:38:35,008
She's actually good.

893
00:38:36,249 --> 00:38:37,928
This time, I lied to her about working overtime.

894
00:38:38,609 --> 00:38:40,008
She called our office.

895
00:38:40,729 --> 00:38:42,329
I know I've been taking a lot of leave recently.

896
00:38:43,169 --> 00:38:44,408
The salary is almost gone.

897
00:38:45,769 --> 00:38:47,089
I'm the one who started it.

898
00:38:48,048 --> 00:38:49,129
So I can come out.

899
00:38:49,888 --> 00:38:50,928
To see you for the last time.

900
00:38:53,008 --> 00:38:53,968
Let's go.

901
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:56,928
She packed up and went back to her parents.

902
00:39:00,488 --> 00:39:01,129
Brothers,

903
00:39:08,769 --> 00:39:09,609
I'm sorry to you.

904
00:39:12,689 --> 00:39:13,089
monkey

905
00:39:15,928 --> 00:39:18,048
when it rains, it pours

906
00:39:19,169 --> 00:39:20,528
It didn't rain overnight.

907
00:39:21,649 --> 00:39:23,368
This is a meteor shower.

908
00:39:44,848 --> 00:39:46,129
Lu Xiao,

909
00:39:49,289 --> 00:39:50,249
Lu Xiao,

910
00:39:51,249 --> 00:39:52,008
south

911
00:39:52,209 --> 00:39:53,368
I really have a very important thing.

912
00:39:53,368 --> 00:39:54,329
I need your help.

913
00:39:54,329 --> 00:39:55,169
Go to No.15 High School.

914
00:39:55,169 --> 00:39:56,488
Find a boy named Lu Xiao Nan.

915
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:03,488
Stop. Who are you looking for?

916
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:04,928
Sir, I'm looking for someone.

917
00:40:05,249 --> 00:40:07,209
All outsiders are not allowed to enter.

918
00:40:07,209 --> 00:40:08,649
Sir, I have something urgent.

919
00:40:08,649 --> 00:40:08,928
Really

920
00:40:08,928 --> 00:40:09,848
You are flexible.

921
00:40:09,848 --> 00:40:10,809
I'll leave after a few words.

922
00:40:11,048 --> 00:40:11,689
I can't accommodate you.

923
00:40:11,689 --> 00:40:12,649
Sir, I'll only say two words.

924
00:40:12,649 --> 00:40:13,089
cannot

925
00:40:13,089 --> 00:40:13,329
No way

926
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:13,649
uncle

927
00:40:13,649 --> 00:40:14,368
No way

928
00:40:14,368 --> 00:40:14,809
What's up

929
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:15,209
No way

930
00:40:17,488 --> 00:40:18,129
What's up

931
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:20,609
I'm looking for someone to call Lu Xiaonan.

932
00:40:20,848 --> 00:40:21,888
Is a student of your school.

933
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:23,769
To find Lu Xiaonan.

934
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:24,769
I'm his head teacher.

935
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:25,408
What's wrong?

936
00:40:25,408 --> 00:40:26,048
Tell me,

937
00:40:26,448 --> 00:40:27,448
You're his head teacher.

938
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:28,249
Just right

939
00:40:28,249 --> 00:40:29,689
Take me to talk to him.

940
00:40:29,848 --> 00:40:30,209
No way

941
00:40:30,488 --> 00:40:31,968
Our class is having a test today.

942
00:40:32,089 --> 00:40:33,289
Do you have something important?

943
00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:33,848
Tell me,

944
00:40:34,609 --> 00:40:35,289
Tell you what,

945
00:40:35,289 --> 00:40:35,809
Yes

946
00:40:36,209 --> 00:40:38,249
Then you must help me to

947
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:39,289
Go ahead.

948
00:40:40,329 --> 00:40:41,209
The 22nd of November.

949
00:40:41,209 --> 00:40:42,408
There's a crossfire competition.

950
00:40:42,729 --> 00:40:43,809
Please don't let him go.

951
00:40:44,048 --> 00:40:44,888
That's all.

952
00:40:46,249 --> 00:40:46,928
What's your name?

953
00:40:47,209 --> 00:40:47,848
I

954
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:50,408
Just tell me.

955
00:40:50,408 --> 00:40:51,848
Just say I'm a very good friend of his.

956
00:40:52,089 --> 00:40:52,609
That's enough.

957
00:40:52,609 --> 00:40:53,249
I know.

958
00:40:54,129 --> 00:40:54,769
Let's go.

959
00:40:55,249 --> 00:40:57,568
You must have brought the words

960
00:40:57,729 --> 00:40:58,528
Thank you, teacher.

961
00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:46,528
Xiaobei

962
00:41:46,888 --> 00:41:47,488
What's up

963
00:41:47,689 --> 00:41:48,368
I'm sleeping.

964
00:41:48,729 --> 00:41:50,008
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

965
00:41:52,888 --> 00:41:53,649
Why are you sleeping?

966
00:41:53,649 --> 00:41:54,568
The hot spot is still open.

967
00:41:56,129 --> 00:41:58,089
Was the light flashing in the room?

968
00:41:59,649 --> 00:42:00,689
I often do this recently.

969
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:11,928
Go to sleep.
