1
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:27,292
The most precious part of people.

2
00:02:27,852 --> 00:02:29,293
Are often unwilling to change.

3
00:02:31,092 --> 00:02:31,733
AnLuan

4
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:34,733
Let's be together.

5
00:02:44,853 --> 00:02:45,533
sorry

6
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:50,612
I'm not surprised at all.

7
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,092
You haven't been

8
00:02:52,092 --> 00:02:53,413
Rejected me for the first time.

9
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:55,172
Can you tell me why?

10
00:02:57,212 --> 00:02:58,013
You know that.

11
00:03:01,532 --> 00:03:03,013
You can't let him go.

12
00:03:08,572 --> 00:03:09,772
For so many years,

13
00:03:10,253 --> 00:03:11,452
Is it really necessary?

14
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:42,732
Where is the coin?

15
00:03:44,613 --> 00:03:45,253
Where is the coin?

16
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:54,453
Let's eat.

17
00:04:04,492 --> 00:04:05,732
Let's be together.

18
00:04:14,093 --> 00:04:15,333
During this period,

19
00:04:18,813 --> 00:04:20,173
Aren't we together every day?

20
00:04:20,772 --> 00:04:22,093
I'm talking about the future.

21
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:23,372
always

22
00:04:25,813 --> 00:04:27,173
This is a bit difficult.

23
00:04:28,332 --> 00:04:30,093
We are not from the same world.

24
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:33,132
Don't put them together.

25
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,493
That's what I thought.

26
00:04:37,213 --> 00:04:39,052
But it's not an island between people.

27
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,172
I can walk into your world.

28
00:04:42,012 --> 00:04:43,452
You can also walk into my

29
00:04:45,572 --> 00:04:46,612
Let's go inside.

30
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,132
You came to the wrong place.

31
00:04:49,213 --> 00:04:50,093
Get out of here.

32
00:04:51,012 --> 00:04:51,813
It's troublesome.

33
00:04:51,973 --> 00:04:53,373
You're talking about probability.

34
00:04:54,732 --> 00:04:56,653
As a bad student who failed math,

35
00:04:57,533 --> 00:04:58,612
I don't believe in probability.

36
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:00,132
Only believe in luck.

37
00:05:04,213 --> 00:05:05,253
You believe this, right?

38
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:06,732
If it's three times,

39
00:05:07,253 --> 00:05:08,653
What if you win three times?

40
00:05:09,452 --> 00:05:10,292
I'll listen to you.

41
00:05:10,413 --> 00:05:11,813
Let's see our luck.

42
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:08,012
original

43
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:11,653
This is our destiny.

44
00:06:39,492 --> 00:06:41,093
This is the destiny I want.

45
00:07:00,292 --> 00:07:01,653
Stop frowning.

46
00:07:23,852 --> 00:07:25,213
I'll take this one.

47
00:07:26,093 --> 00:07:26,612
Thank you

48
00:07:47,893 --> 00:07:48,852
Come on, Captain.

49
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:50,932
So full.

50
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,013
captain

51
00:07:57,492 --> 00:08:00,052
They also want yogurt.

52
00:08:00,893 --> 00:08:01,692
Have a drink.

53
00:08:01,893 --> 00:08:03,213
All right. You're full, right?

54
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:03,773
Let's go.

55
00:08:04,013 --> 00:08:06,213
Let's see how the Dragon Warrior is.

56
00:08:06,213 --> 00:08:07,692
What we see now is

57
00:08:07,692 --> 00:08:08,773
National Challenge.

58
00:08:08,773 --> 00:08:10,252
The group match.

59
00:08:10,413 --> 00:08:11,093
The battle is

60
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:13,333
Dragon Warrior Team and Black Jack Team

61
00:08:20,773 --> 00:08:21,932
pretty

62
00:08:24,492 --> 00:08:26,013
Now, let's welcome the troops.

63
00:08:26,013 --> 00:08:27,973
Get ready with the Allure Team.

64
00:08:28,413 --> 00:08:29,852
Get ready. It's our turn.

65
00:08:29,852 --> 00:08:30,453
Come on. Go.

66
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:44,732
I'll bet you

67
00:08:44,852 --> 00:08:46,413
The team will definitely lose.

68
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:47,292
Next time, they will...

69
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:48,973
And never have to meet the Dragon Warrior again.

70
00:08:49,172 --> 00:08:51,093
You don't have to be a fool.

71
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,093
Besides Ming,

72
00:08:59,093 --> 00:09:00,172
Everyone else, follow me to Point A.

73
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:00,852
Focus on A.

74
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:01,252
Received

75
00:09:01,252 --> 00:09:02,213
Ming, go to point B yourself.

76
00:09:02,213 --> 00:09:02,852
no problem

77
00:09:02,852 --> 00:09:03,172
Received

78
00:09:05,692 --> 00:09:06,333
Cover for Xiao Feng.

79
00:09:07,852 --> 00:09:08,413
I'll leave it to you.

80
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:08,812
good

81
00:09:15,093 --> 00:09:15,812
I'm behind you.

82
00:09:15,812 --> 00:09:16,612
I rushed, Xiao Feng.

83
00:09:16,612 --> 00:09:17,372
Go for it.

84
00:09:17,692 --> 00:09:18,533
Two, two.

85
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:19,133
I'll do it.

86
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:20,172
pretty

87
00:09:20,172 --> 00:09:20,852
Two people at B.

88
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:21,333
Is it possible?

89
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:21,893
Can I...

90
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:23,172
B points off one.

91
00:09:23,172 --> 00:09:24,252
pretty

92
00:09:24,252 --> 00:09:24,893
I dropped another one.

93
00:09:24,893 --> 00:09:26,172
Yes, Ming.

94
00:09:27,492 --> 00:09:29,093
Ah Ming is amazing today.

95
00:09:29,093 --> 00:09:29,973
The last one.

96
00:09:29,973 --> 00:09:30,653
Let's go together.

97
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,653
I want to rob Ming.

98
00:09:31,653 --> 00:09:32,252
Up, up.

99
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:33,172
Take care of him.

100
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,172
Rush and rush.

101
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:35,492
pretty

102
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:40,732
This one.

103
00:09:40,852 --> 00:09:41,533
Sure.

104
00:09:42,573 --> 00:09:43,292
Hold on.

105
00:09:43,973 --> 00:09:45,292
Keep your mind.

106
00:09:51,573 --> 00:09:52,093
Old sand, old sand

107
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:54,413
Captain.

108
00:09:54,413 --> 00:09:56,252
pretty

109
00:09:56,252 --> 00:09:57,133
You can go.

110
00:09:57,133 --> 00:09:58,213
Don't rush.

111
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:00,852
The path is empty.

112
00:10:00,852 --> 00:10:01,573
Come on.

113
00:10:01,573 --> 00:10:02,172
Copy that.

114
00:10:03,653 --> 00:10:04,612
Up, up.

115
00:10:05,932 --> 00:10:08,732
pretty

116
00:10:11,492 --> 00:10:12,653
Let's change to another tactic.

117
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:13,372
And the old one.

118
00:10:13,372 --> 00:10:14,013
Monkey, stay here.

119
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:14,372
good

120
00:10:19,773 --> 00:10:20,413
Old sand, old sand

121
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:23,372
pretty

122
00:10:25,453 --> 00:10:26,533
Monkey, you're hiding the monkey.

123
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:27,172
Don't worry.

124
00:10:27,172 --> 00:10:28,333
I also want to take someone

125
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,172
We can't let Ming take it all by himself.

126
00:10:34,172 --> 00:10:35,453
Monkey, don't force yourself.

127
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:36,292
good

128
00:10:40,492 --> 00:10:41,093
Captain.

129
00:10:41,093 --> 00:10:41,453
Received

130
00:10:41,453 --> 00:10:42,172
Give me a head.

131
00:10:42,172 --> 00:10:42,852
well

132
00:10:45,852 --> 00:10:46,653
Come on.

133
00:10:46,653 --> 00:10:47,252
good

134
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,172
There are three more.

135
00:10:51,812 --> 00:10:53,812
Congratulations to Steel Jump Team for winning the competition.

136
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:01,533
Beautiful, beautiful.

137
00:11:01,853 --> 00:11:02,893
Shake hands.

138
00:11:04,452 --> 00:11:05,013
You played well.

139
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,812
It's tough. You're good.

140
00:11:06,893 --> 00:11:07,812
One, two, three.

141
00:11:07,972 --> 00:11:09,092
The Coin Team.

142
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:11,413
I'll never be able to explain it.

143
00:11:11,413 --> 00:11:13,092
Let's say hello to the audience.

144
00:11:13,493 --> 00:11:14,092
Come on.

145
00:11:20,773 --> 00:11:22,092
I really replied.

146
00:11:22,212 --> 00:11:23,893
Fans are different.

147
00:11:24,013 --> 00:11:24,292
That's enough.

148
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:25,533
Pack up, pack up and go.

149
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:31,373
congratulations

150
00:11:31,773 --> 00:11:32,613
We share the same happiness.

151
00:11:33,052 --> 00:11:35,212
Actually, we can avoid running into each other in the next round.

152
00:11:35,893 --> 00:11:37,452
You can't avoid the first day.

153
00:11:37,773 --> 00:11:39,052
I've always wanted to learn from you.

154
00:11:39,373 --> 00:11:40,092
I'm looking forward to it.

155
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:41,812
See you next time.

156
00:11:41,812 --> 00:11:42,493
good

157
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:50,172
What we see now is

158
00:11:50,172 --> 00:11:50,932
Semi-professional League Group Stage

159
00:11:50,932 --> 00:11:51,733
Game site

160
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:52,812
For the southern monster,

161
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,413
Whether I can win this game,

162
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:55,613
For the knockout game.

163
00:11:56,253 --> 00:11:57,332
Lu Xiao Bei killed one.

164
00:11:57,332 --> 00:11:57,932
Two in the mouth A.

165
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:01,493
Nezha ordered the opponent easily.

166
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:02,893
Another spy.

167
00:12:03,332 --> 00:12:03,853
pretty

168
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:04,292
pretty

169
00:12:12,013 --> 00:12:12,653
pretty

170
00:12:13,212 --> 00:12:13,932
Southern monster

171
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:15,452
Completely mastered the rhythm of the game.

172
00:12:15,452 --> 00:12:16,212
And crushed the opponent.

173
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:21,613
Southern monster

174
00:12:21,613 --> 00:12:23,133
After changing the main lineup,

175
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:24,812
The cooperation of the players is very tacit.

176
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:27,013
And killed six generals all the way.

177
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,773
They look unstoppable.

178
00:12:56,653 --> 00:12:58,133
Oh, my God. Unbelievable.

179
00:12:58,452 --> 00:13:00,212
The southern monster finally won three victories.

180
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:01,172
To the finals.

181
00:13:01,212 --> 00:13:02,413
The southern monster can be said to be

182
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:03,572
This semi-professional league

183
00:13:03,572 --> 00:13:04,692
The biggest black horse.

184
00:13:04,692 --> 00:13:06,533
They are about to compete in the finals.

185
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:07,932
To compete with Li Kun.

186
00:13:07,932 --> 00:13:08,733
AK Team

187
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:10,052
Li Kun is 18 years old.

188
00:13:10,052 --> 00:13:11,332
He won the semi-professional Golden Spear King.

189
00:13:11,613 --> 00:13:12,533
He fought in Han and Tang for three years.

190
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:13,172
Crossfire Professional League

191
00:13:13,373 --> 00:13:14,932
To the Final Four every year.

192
00:13:14,932 --> 00:13:16,413
And won the championship of the game carnival.

193
00:13:16,413 --> 00:13:17,572
And the runner-up of the World Esports Championship.

194
00:13:17,853 --> 00:13:19,692
Then he quarreled with his teammates and quit the team.

195
00:13:19,692 --> 00:13:20,613
Disappeared for more than a year.

196
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,172
I heard that you went back to your hometown to get married.

197
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,013
And opened an online cafe.

198
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:24,572
This year, we suddenly formed a team.

199
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:27,812
Then he will play semi-professional.

200
00:13:27,812 --> 00:13:29,212
It's just a dimension reduction.

201
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:31,133
No wonder the winning rate is so high.

202
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:33,972
You fought with them.

203
00:13:34,332 --> 00:13:35,052
How do you feel?

204
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:36,533
That 2-0 loss

205
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:37,413
The assassin is comprehensive.

206
00:13:37,572 --> 00:13:38,692
There's no obvious weakness.

207
00:13:39,013 --> 00:13:40,212
Of course, Li Kun is the strongest.

208
00:13:40,212 --> 00:13:41,373
He is very good at blocking the traffic.

209
00:13:41,493 --> 00:13:42,332
AK is good.

210
00:14:00,052 --> 00:14:00,972
It's been a long time.

211
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:04,212
I've been too busy recently.

212
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:06,413
You don't have time to see me.

213
00:14:07,692 --> 00:14:08,692
I've been busy training.

214
00:14:09,692 --> 00:14:10,692
Tomorrow's final.

215
00:14:11,013 --> 00:14:12,212
Are you ready?

216
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,572
It's okay.

217
00:14:14,373 --> 00:14:15,493
The southern monster is strong.

218
00:14:16,413 --> 00:14:17,733
Especially the ones in the back.

219
00:14:20,613 --> 00:14:21,733
I'm optimistic about your team.

220
00:14:23,292 --> 00:14:25,133
Let me know if you need anything.

221
00:14:29,373 --> 00:14:30,292
Thank you.

222
00:14:30,692 --> 00:14:31,452
However

223
00:14:31,893 --> 00:14:33,013
My age is here.

224
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:35,013
If we lose this game,

225
00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:37,572
This is the last game of my career.

226
00:14:38,692 --> 00:14:39,493
We have to win.

227
00:14:40,052 --> 00:14:41,773
We have the chance to continue to fight.

228
00:14:42,253 --> 00:14:42,932
therefore

229
00:14:43,932 --> 00:14:44,932
You don't need to be mobilized.

230
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:46,653
We will definitely fight with our lives.

231
00:15:05,893 --> 00:15:06,613
That's amazing.

232
00:15:07,092 --> 00:15:08,332
In pairs

233
00:15:12,373 --> 00:15:13,493
Isn't that Gao Bosong?

234
00:15:14,692 --> 00:15:15,853
Oh, my God.

235
00:15:17,172 --> 00:15:18,893
Chuge never runs with others.

236
00:15:22,452 --> 00:15:23,172
Where are you going?

237
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:27,092
Lu Xiao Bei,

238
00:15:27,853 --> 00:15:28,613
Lu Xiao Bei,

239
00:15:30,373 --> 00:15:31,733
Aren't you here to give me the tickets?

240
00:15:33,572 --> 00:15:34,332
Why are you leaving?

241
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:35,733
My name is Cheng Hao. Hello.

242
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:36,572
I saw your performance that day.

243
00:15:36,572 --> 00:15:37,413
I really like you.

244
00:15:37,413 --> 00:15:38,773
Guitar playing is great.

245
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:39,893
Can you teach me?

246
00:15:40,452 --> 00:15:41,013
Here is your ticket.

247
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:42,452
There are two altogether.

248
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:44,373
Bring your Senior Brother Gao with you.

249
00:15:45,253 --> 00:15:46,133
I want to learn two butterflies.

250
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:46,853
Can you play it?

251
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:48,493
You're not only handsome,

252
00:15:48,493 --> 00:15:49,493
You have talent. I'm telling you.

253
00:15:57,972 --> 00:15:59,493
It's hard to choose.

254
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,013
Let's analyze it for you.

255
00:16:01,812 --> 00:16:03,052
Brother Gao.

256
00:16:05,812 --> 00:16:07,052
His advantage is that

257
00:16:07,493 --> 00:16:08,212
And handsome.

258
00:16:08,452 --> 00:16:09,092
Big eyes.

259
00:16:09,572 --> 00:16:10,853
A good family.

260
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:12,292
And got good grades.

261
00:16:12,292 --> 00:16:14,373
Besides chasing more girls,

262
00:16:14,613 --> 00:16:15,692
Without any shortcomings.

263
00:16:16,413 --> 00:16:18,972
Let's look at Lu Xiao Bei.

264
00:16:23,812 --> 00:16:26,853
The advantage of Lu Xiao Bei

265
00:16:28,932 --> 00:16:30,733
How about you?

266
00:16:31,253 --> 00:16:33,572
If Senior High is the self-heating pot,

267
00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:34,533
You're handsome and talented.

268
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:35,493
Lu Xiabei,

269
00:16:35,812 --> 00:16:37,972
Is the white bread without taste.

270
00:16:38,253 --> 00:16:39,653
Without any advantage.

271
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:42,812
That's right.

272
00:16:43,332 --> 00:16:44,533
I don't think it has any advantage.

273
00:16:49,812 --> 00:16:52,013
We are like

274
00:16:53,172 --> 00:16:55,253
staff

275
00:16:55,253 --> 00:16:56,853
Blank paper.

276
00:16:58,013 --> 00:16:59,932
Your name.

277
00:16:59,932 --> 00:17:02,613
Looking at you in silence.

278
00:17:03,613 --> 00:17:04,413
Chu song

279
00:17:05,212 --> 00:17:06,812
Do you know how hard it is

280
00:17:06,812 --> 00:17:07,893
How does it feel?

281
00:17:10,092 --> 00:17:11,133
Actually, I really want to know.

282
00:17:16,052 --> 00:17:17,253
If you love someone,

283
00:17:17,572 --> 00:17:19,212
You want to get close to him.

284
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:20,092
Get to know him.

285
00:17:20,413 --> 00:17:21,052
Take care of him.

286
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:22,413
Happy things.

287
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:23,773
I want to share it with him.

288
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:25,292
And unhappy things.

289
00:17:25,692 --> 00:17:26,972
I want to take it with him.

290
00:17:30,613 --> 00:17:31,253
that

291
00:17:32,533 --> 00:17:33,653
Do you have someone you like?

292
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:41,013
Now,

293
00:17:41,452 --> 00:17:42,253
I don't know.

294
00:17:42,533 --> 00:17:43,692
Because I can't tell the difference.

295
00:17:43,692 --> 00:17:46,572
The difference between love and friendship.

296
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:50,733
Friends can share.

297
00:17:51,253 --> 00:17:52,253
But lovers can't.

298
00:17:54,013 --> 00:17:55,332
Friendship means

299
00:17:55,332 --> 00:17:56,812
Two people and the world.

300
00:17:57,932 --> 00:17:58,932
Love means

301
00:17:59,893 --> 00:18:01,292
Two people are the world.

302
00:18:02,212 --> 00:18:02,932
such as

303
00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:05,853
This moment

304
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:18,853
one's master's/teacher's son who is older than oneself

305
00:18:19,373 --> 00:18:20,092
Thank you.

306
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:21,493
Thank me.

307
00:18:22,572 --> 00:18:23,893
I seem to understand now.

308
00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:25,013
What do you like?

309
00:18:28,413 --> 00:18:29,812
Where are you going?

310
00:18:31,572 --> 00:18:32,773
To find the one I like.

311
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:36,572
No

312
00:18:43,692 --> 00:18:44,692
Welcome to

313
00:18:44,692 --> 00:18:45,972
The semi-league final.

314
00:18:46,332 --> 00:18:48,812
To invite the fans of AK Team

315
00:18:48,812 --> 00:18:49,812
Sit here.

316
00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:51,413
Now the fans of Southern Monsters

317
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:52,452
Let's go this way.

318
00:18:52,692 --> 00:18:54,092
Then we can sit according to the seat.

319
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,253
All right, everyone,

320
00:18:56,253 --> 00:18:57,452
Thank you again for coming to us.

321
00:18:57,452 --> 00:18:58,212
Today's

322
00:18:58,212 --> 00:19:00,452
The scene of Tencent Esports Games.

323
00:19:00,452 --> 00:19:01,052
What about today?

324
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:02,932
Is also our ultimate battle.

325
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:04,893
I believe everyone's mood

326
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,893
You must be as excited as us.

327
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:08,332
Then we won't talk much.

328
00:19:08,812 --> 00:19:10,533
Let's welcome today's

329
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:11,613
Team, enter.

330
00:19:11,613 --> 00:19:13,653
Please welcome the AK team.

331
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,572
Please come.

332
00:19:20,853 --> 00:19:22,493
What a passionate AK.

333
00:19:22,493 --> 00:19:24,932
AK AK

334
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,293
The final battle of the season.

335
00:19:27,492 --> 00:19:29,172
This will be the most exciting battle.

336
00:19:29,573 --> 00:19:30,093
That's right.

337
00:19:30,492 --> 00:19:32,613
We see the AK team has entered the battle room.

338
00:19:32,613 --> 00:19:33,172
AK Team

339
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,492
Why is it called AK Team?

340
00:19:34,492 --> 00:19:36,093
Besides the sponsor of their team,

341
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:37,133
It's AK Men's Wear.

342
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:38,692
But also because among their teams,

343
00:19:38,692 --> 00:19:40,012
A few of them are very good at using it.

344
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,373
The members of AK47

345
00:19:43,172 --> 00:19:44,252
It's time to go out.

346
00:19:45,093 --> 00:19:46,053
Hold on.

347
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:53,172
Are you scared?

348
00:20:00,053 --> 00:20:00,813
I'm scared too.

349
00:20:02,772 --> 00:20:03,653
I'm afraid of losing.

350
00:20:05,053 --> 00:20:06,653
I'm afraid that my previous efforts were in vain.

351
00:20:07,853 --> 00:20:09,212
I'm afraid it's not easy to take this step.

352
00:20:09,853 --> 00:20:10,893
And returned to the prototype.

353
00:20:11,452 --> 00:20:12,853
If a person is afraid,

354
00:20:13,532 --> 00:20:14,212
that

355
00:20:14,772 --> 00:20:15,853
Can you still be brave?

356
00:20:20,212 --> 00:20:21,532
Now we only have one way.

357
00:20:22,613 --> 00:20:23,573
Is to go out.

358
00:20:24,012 --> 00:20:25,093
To win this game.

359
00:20:25,452 --> 00:20:26,613
Into the Crossfire Professional League.

360
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:37,613
Go on.

361
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:38,373
And wins.

362
00:20:38,452 --> 00:20:39,212
And wins.

363
00:20:39,252 --> 00:20:40,252
And wins.

364
00:20:40,452 --> 00:20:41,413
Let's welcome

365
00:20:41,413 --> 00:20:42,972
The monster of the South

366
00:20:42,972 --> 00:20:44,133
to ask sb in

367
00:21:06,653 --> 00:21:08,012
The champion.

368
00:21:08,012 --> 00:21:09,053
Who is it?

369
00:21:09,053 --> 00:21:10,252
Is still an unknown quantity.

370
00:21:10,653 --> 00:21:11,172
that's right

371
00:21:11,252 --> 00:21:12,853
Today, I believe all the friends here

372
00:21:12,853 --> 00:21:13,932
Are the same as us.

373
00:21:13,932 --> 00:21:15,813
Looking forward to the start of the game.

374
00:21:15,932 --> 00:21:17,172
What about the next time?

375
00:21:17,172 --> 00:21:18,333
And asked us to put the stage

376
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,333
To the two teams on the stage.

377
00:21:20,532 --> 00:21:22,932
Let's look forward to the opening of the competition.

378
00:21:22,932 --> 00:21:24,053
to ask sb in

379
00:21:25,212 --> 00:21:26,293
Although the southern monster

380
00:21:26,293 --> 00:21:27,373
This semi-professional league

381
00:21:27,373 --> 00:21:28,573
The biggest dark horse team.

382
00:21:28,573 --> 00:21:29,373
But in the face of having

383
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:31,053
A veteran of many titles, Li Kun.

384
00:21:31,053 --> 00:21:32,053
AK Shadow Team

385
00:21:32,053 --> 00:21:33,133
Is very stressful.

386
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:34,813
Yes, this game will be

387
00:21:34,813 --> 00:21:36,492
The key battle of crossing the line of fire professional league.

388
00:21:42,573 --> 00:21:43,492
Let's go. Three A.

389
00:21:43,932 --> 00:21:44,613
Received

390
00:21:44,893 --> 00:21:45,813
The game has started.

391
00:21:45,813 --> 00:21:47,293
In fact, the biggest highlight of this game

392
00:21:47,293 --> 00:21:49,893
Is whether the southern monster can be black to the end.

393
00:21:50,093 --> 00:21:51,452
The current members of Southern Monster

394
00:21:51,452 --> 00:21:53,172
From the bench all the way up.

395
00:21:53,532 --> 00:21:54,893
Although they have strong momentum,

396
00:21:54,893 --> 00:21:56,012
But AK's No Shadow,

397
00:21:56,012 --> 00:21:57,613
And experienced Li Kun.

398
00:21:57,893 --> 00:22:00,692
Who will be the semi-professional champion?

399
00:22:00,692 --> 00:22:01,893
Let's wait and see.

400
00:22:01,893 --> 00:22:02,772
Watch A Alley.

401
00:22:03,492 --> 00:22:04,252
Full speed.

402
00:22:04,732 --> 00:22:05,252
on

403
00:22:08,133 --> 00:22:08,893
Someone.

404
00:22:08,893 --> 00:22:09,532
Be careful.

405
00:22:11,053 --> 00:22:12,093
I lost it. I dropped it.

406
00:22:12,093 --> 00:22:12,772
Where is the enemy?

407
00:22:12,772 --> 00:22:13,732
In B water, B water.

408
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:14,813
Wang Kai, go to support.

409
00:22:17,893 --> 00:22:18,732
One is missing.

410
00:22:18,732 --> 00:22:19,813
Good, Su Jiayi.

411
00:22:19,813 --> 00:22:20,492
pretty

412
00:22:23,452 --> 00:22:24,252
Point B, the enemy is gone.

413
00:22:24,252 --> 00:22:25,373
Up the stairs.

414
00:22:26,373 --> 00:22:27,093
Come on

415
00:22:28,813 --> 00:22:29,893
Now AK Shadow Team

416
00:22:29,893 --> 00:22:30,613
To the monster of the South.

417
00:22:30,613 --> 00:22:32,212
Caused a lot of psychological pressure.

418
00:22:32,212 --> 00:22:32,853
And only

419
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:34,373
S + 1 and Wang Kai.

420
00:22:34,373 --> 00:22:35,133
Three, two, three.

421
00:22:35,133 --> 00:22:35,893
Don't panic.

422
00:22:35,893 --> 00:22:36,373
Hold on.

423
00:22:36,492 --> 00:22:36,893
It's okay.

424
00:22:36,893 --> 00:22:37,813
Hold on.

425
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:46,093
We ran into each other.

426
00:22:46,413 --> 00:22:47,293
S + 1 dropped.

427
00:22:47,772 --> 00:22:48,932
Wang Kai also made a series of mistakes.

428
00:22:49,413 --> 00:22:51,373
AK successfully won the first round.

429
00:22:52,613 --> 00:22:53,373
In the first round,

430
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,133
Both teams are conservative in tactics.

431
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:55,853
In my opinion,

432
00:22:55,853 --> 00:22:58,252
The monster in the south lacks competition experience.

433
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:58,813
that's right

434
00:22:58,813 --> 00:22:59,653
AK, this way.

435
00:22:59,653 --> 00:23:01,452
After all, he is an experienced veteran.

436
00:23:01,452 --> 00:23:02,492
No matter from tactical experience,

437
00:23:02,492 --> 00:23:04,373
Is still stronger than the southern monster.

438
00:23:04,532 --> 00:23:05,293
The rhythm of the first round.

439
00:23:05,293 --> 00:23:07,452
Has been completely controlled by AK Wuyin.

440
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:08,613
The southern monster now

441
00:23:08,613 --> 00:23:09,772
It seems to be passive.

442
00:23:16,133 --> 00:23:17,172
It's okay.

443
00:23:17,452 --> 00:23:18,333
Play slowly.

444
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:19,573
To come back.

445
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:20,732
good

446
00:23:21,093 --> 00:23:21,813
Play slowly.

447
00:23:22,492 --> 00:23:23,212
Hold still

448
00:23:24,133 --> 00:23:24,893
Come on

449
00:23:36,133 --> 00:23:37,653
Go, go. B point.

450
00:23:38,532 --> 00:23:39,373
One, one.

451
00:23:39,373 --> 00:23:40,452
They're coming from the middle.

452
00:23:41,093 --> 00:23:42,133
Wang Kai, it's B.

453
00:24:00,133 --> 00:24:00,772
Keep your mind steady.

454
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:02,333
Adjust the aim and recoil.

455
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,333
Be careful

456
00:24:22,932 --> 00:24:23,532
Thunder

457
00:24:23,853 --> 00:24:24,613
dang!

458
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:48,133
pretty

459
00:25:49,932 --> 00:25:52,252
That's a good gun.

460
00:25:52,252 --> 00:25:53,172
Su Jiayi is great.

461
00:25:54,732 --> 00:25:55,532
Thank you.

462
00:26:03,252 --> 00:26:04,492
We brought them back.

463
00:26:05,012 --> 00:26:06,133
There must be fluctuations in your mind.

464
00:26:06,373 --> 00:26:07,732
All the players are old.

465
00:26:08,172 --> 00:26:09,172
So in the next round,

466
00:26:09,532 --> 00:26:10,893
They will definitely want to play steadily.

467
00:26:12,373 --> 00:26:13,813
We can't fall into their rhythm.

468
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:15,053
Next round.

469
00:26:15,732 --> 00:26:16,813
We need to attack.

470
00:26:16,932 --> 00:26:17,732
And beat him.

471
00:26:19,532 --> 00:26:20,093
Come on

472
00:26:20,093 --> 00:26:20,532
One off.

473
00:26:20,532 --> 00:26:22,373
Now we come to the third match point.

474
00:26:22,692 --> 00:26:24,053
After the last two games,

475
00:26:24,053 --> 00:26:26,093
The southern monster has made a new tactical adjustment.

476
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:28,893
AK, Li Kun knocked out S + 1.

477
00:26:29,133 --> 00:26:29,413
I dropped it.

478
00:26:29,413 --> 00:26:30,972
The competition has become more and more exciting.

479
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,732
Cheng Hao came to the middle to fill the position.

480
00:26:32,972 --> 00:26:33,853
Cheng Hao also dropped.

481
00:26:34,373 --> 00:26:35,413
The monster of the South

482
00:26:35,413 --> 00:26:36,613
Only Lu Xiao Bei and Nezha remain.

483
00:26:37,293 --> 00:26:39,252
AK quickly surrounded them.

484
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:48,012
On the platform.

485
00:26:48,012 --> 00:26:48,813
Next step.

486
00:26:48,813 --> 00:26:49,772
There's one behind the box.

487
00:26:49,972 --> 00:26:50,853
We were wrapped up.

488
00:26:54,452 --> 00:26:55,333
What now?

489
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,692
I'll finish the one behind the stairs.

490
00:26:57,972 --> 00:26:58,932
Leave the other two to you.

491
00:26:58,972 --> 00:26:59,972
No, you will die.

492
00:26:59,972 --> 00:27:00,972
Only if I die can you have a chance.

493
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:02,732
I only have four rounds left.

494
00:27:02,732 --> 00:27:03,373
That's enough.

495
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:03,853
You can see

496
00:27:03,853 --> 00:27:05,853
The monster in the South is in a dilemma.

497
00:27:05,853 --> 00:27:07,053
The situation is very bad.

498
00:27:07,053 --> 00:27:08,452
Lu Xiabei and Nezha are on the bridge.

499
00:27:08,452 --> 00:27:10,053
Surrounded by AK No Shadow Three.

500
00:27:10,252 --> 00:27:10,972
The critical moment.

501
00:27:10,972 --> 00:27:12,732
Can they break through?

502
00:27:13,293 --> 00:27:14,532
The question you asked me just now,

503
00:27:15,613 --> 00:27:16,813
I'll answer you now.

504
00:27:19,492 --> 00:27:20,732
Only when you're scared,

505
00:27:24,212 --> 00:27:25,333
And become brave.

506
00:27:26,532 --> 00:27:27,012
Zha

507
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:28,172
I believe in you.

508
00:27:29,252 --> 00:27:30,452
Lu Xiao Bei is attacking.

509
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:32,053
And knocked one out.

510
00:27:32,732 --> 00:27:33,692
Lu Xiao Bei also fell off.

511
00:27:37,133 --> 00:27:38,573
Now the scene has been formed,

512
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:39,613
A two-on-one situation.

513
00:27:40,053 --> 00:27:41,413
All the hopes of the southern monster

514
00:27:41,413 --> 00:27:42,333
It's all on Nezha.

515
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:43,573
Nezha, fill the gun.

516
00:27:43,573 --> 00:27:44,212
Hold on.

517
00:27:44,212 --> 00:27:44,932
Resupply.

518
00:27:46,573 --> 00:27:47,452
Nezha knocked one out.

519
00:27:47,452 --> 00:27:47,893
I dropped one.

520
00:27:47,893 --> 00:27:48,653
pretty

521
00:27:49,452 --> 00:27:51,053
Now it's a one-to-one situation.

522
00:27:53,893 --> 00:27:55,212
Nezha was beaten into a bloody wreck.

523
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:55,893
What a pity.

524
00:27:55,893 --> 00:27:57,093
Li Kun actually missed.

525
00:28:08,893 --> 00:28:10,853
The monster of the South has done wonders

526

00:28:12,093 --> 00:28:14,172
The semi-professional league champion of the year.

00:28:14,172 --> 00:28:15,333

To win this semi-league.

00:28:50,012 --> 00:28:50,972
The champion of the stage.

537
00:28:50,972 --> 00:28:52,293
Very excited.

538
00:28:52,653 --> 00:28:54,413
Okay, let's welcome the Southern Monster.

539
00:28:54,413 --> 00:28:55,853
To the front of the stage.

00:28:55,853 --> 00:28:57,653
And receive the trophy that belongs to you.

541
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,293
to ask sb in

542
00:29:02,932 --> 00:29:04,653
The trophy is already yours.

Go on.

544
00:29:07,972 --> 00:29:09,452
Wow, I'm really excited.

545
00:29:09,452 --> 00:29:10,853
Go on.

546
00:29:10,853 --> 00:29:11,413
Southern monster

547
00:29:11,413 --> 00:29:12,653
T, what?

548
00:29:12,653 --> 00:29:19,012
Southern monster

549
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:19,732
The champions.

550
00:29:19,853 --> 00:29:21,012
I have the trophy.

551
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:21,932
Do you still want the bonus?

552
00:29:21,932 --> 00:29:23,133
want

553
00:29:23,293 --> 00:29:24,012
Let's welcome

00:29:25,492 --> 00:29:26,172

Mr. Xu, please welcome

00:29:33,893 --> 00:29:35,573
Congratulations.

560
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:37,413
I'm very happy to be here

561
00:29:37,413 --> 00:29:38,333
To witness it together.

562
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:40,413
The last exciting moment.

563
00:29:40,573 --> 00:29:41,452
What's next?

564
00:29:41,452 --> 00:29:42,853
Let's welcome President Xu.

565
00:29:42,853 --> 00:29:45,252
For all the winners on our stage,

00:29:48,573 --> 00:29:50,573
To our southern monster again.

569
00:29:50,573 --> 00:29:52,413
Congratulate them on winning the championship.

570
00:29:52,413 --> 00:29:53,492
congratulations

571
00:29:53,853 --> 00:29:55,093
Thank you again, President Xu.

572
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,692
Please take a rest.

573
00:29:57,692 --> 00:29:58,813
What about the next time?

574
00:29:58,813 --> 00:30:00,893
The teammates of Southern Monster

575
00:30:00,893 --> 00:30:02,093
Can go to our backstage.

576
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:03,212
Take a rest.

577
00:30:03,413 --> 00:30:05,172
Thank you and congratulations.

578
00:30:05,172 --> 00:30:05,732
congratulations

579
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:08,813
Please welcome

580
00:30:08,813 --> 00:30:10,653
Let's go. Go.

581
00:30:15,853 --> 00:30:17,012
Hello, everyone.

582
00:30:17,012 --> 00:30:17,972
I'm Cheng Hao.

583
00:30:18,252 --> 00:30:18,732
That

584
00:30:18,893 --> 00:30:19,972
This is Su Jiayi.

585
00:30:21,492 --> 00:30:22,373
This is Wang Kai.

586
00:30:22,492 --> 00:30:24,972
Our team just won a championship.

587
00:30:24,972 --> 00:30:26,133
I was so excited.

588
00:30:26,212 --> 00:30:26,653
That

589
00:30:26,732 --> 00:30:29,053
Come on, Su Jiayi. Say something.

590
00:30:32,893 --> 00:30:33,853
Have you seen An Lan?

591
00:30:34,212 --> 00:30:34,813
President Xu.

592
00:30:35,452 --> 00:30:36,252
I didn't see her.

593
00:30:37,613 --> 00:30:38,133
President Xu.

594
00:30:38,813 --> 00:30:39,532
Please wait a moment.

595
00:30:40,133 --> 00:30:41,012
What's wrong, Xiao Bei?

596
00:30:41,293 --> 00:30:42,772
Are you interested in talking about joining?

597
00:30:43,573 --> 00:30:44,373
You misunderstood.

598
00:30:45,012 --> 00:30:46,492
I want to ask you about someone.

599
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:47,532
who

600
00:30:47,932 --> 00:30:48,613
Xiao Feng.

601
00:30:49,172 --> 00:30:50,093
Your former teammates

602
00:30:50,813 --> 00:30:51,692
Do you know him?

603
00:30:53,413 --> 00:30:54,172
Kind of.

604
00:30:54,772 --> 00:30:55,772
Where is he now?

605
00:30:57,133 --> 00:30:59,452
I'm busy with business all over the world.

606
00:30:59,653 --> 00:31:01,053
I haven't seen him for a long time.

607
00:31:01,373 --> 00:31:03,492
I met him once at the airport.

608
00:31:03,492 --> 00:31:05,053
In a hurry.

609
00:31:05,252 --> 00:31:06,012
that

610
00:31:06,252 --> 00:31:07,732
Do you have his current contact information?

611
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:08,692
He changed the number.

612
00:31:09,172 --> 00:31:10,972
I can't get through to him.

613
00:31:10,972 --> 00:31:12,212
You can't even reach him.

614
00:31:12,613 --> 00:31:14,293
The circle of life has changed.

615
00:31:15,012 --> 00:31:17,532
Even good friends will grow apart.

616
00:31:18,172 --> 00:31:19,573
Why are you looking for Xiao Feng?

617
00:31:23,532 --> 00:31:24,532
I admire him very much.

618
00:31:25,252 --> 00:31:26,172
Over the years,

619
00:31:26,452 --> 00:31:28,053
There's no news of him online.

620
00:31:29,172 --> 00:31:30,053
I want to know.

621
00:31:30,653 --> 00:31:31,653
Where did he go?

622
00:31:33,212 --> 00:31:34,532
Many people are like this.

623
00:31:35,212 --> 00:31:37,133
And disappeared.

624
00:31:37,613 --> 00:31:39,413
The world is bigger than we thought.

625
00:31:39,813 --> 00:31:40,413
Thank you, President Xu.

626
00:31:42,012 --> 00:31:42,972
If you can,

627
00:31:43,293 --> 00:31:44,452
If I hear from him,

628
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:45,373
Please tell me.

629
00:31:45,492 --> 00:31:46,293
no problem

630
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:48,053
You played well.

631
00:31:48,053 --> 00:31:48,732
Come on.

632
00:31:49,053 --> 00:31:49,692
Thank you

633
00:31:52,813 --> 00:31:54,172
The problem that needs to be improved this time.

634
00:31:54,172 --> 00:31:55,452
Are you all clear?

635
00:32:06,573 --> 00:32:07,293
Got it?

636
00:32:09,893 --> 00:32:10,893
Go on.

637
00:32:12,093 --> 00:32:12,813
Give it to me.

638
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:13,972
I'll send you back.

639
00:32:24,093 --> 00:32:24,972
Why are you here?

640
00:32:24,972 --> 00:32:26,373
Cheng Hao and the others are looking for you.

641
00:32:27,053 --> 00:32:28,053
Then let's go back.

642
00:32:32,293 --> 00:32:33,293
I know. Thank you.

643
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:36,252
Thank you

644
00:32:37,932 --> 00:32:39,212
Let me drive you.

645
00:32:39,893 --> 00:32:41,452
No, I'll be there soon.

646
00:32:41,732 --> 00:32:42,972
Let him go back.

647
00:32:43,053 --> 00:32:44,772
We can have dinner together tonight.

648
00:32:44,972 --> 00:32:46,373
I have an appointment tonight.

649
00:32:46,373 --> 00:32:47,333
Another day.

650
00:32:47,692 --> 00:32:48,772
You can take a rain check.

651
00:32:48,893 --> 00:32:50,373
Are you so unwilling to have dinner with me?

652
00:32:52,093 --> 00:32:53,813
Would you be angry if I said yes?

653
00:32:54,853 --> 00:32:55,893
Did you confess your love that day?

654
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:56,772
I scared you.

655
00:32:58,492 --> 00:32:59,252
Not really.

656
00:33:01,293 --> 00:33:02,692
It's okay for you to reject me.

657
00:33:02,692 --> 00:33:03,692
I don't mind it.

658
00:33:05,093 --> 00:33:07,133
I treasure our friendship very much.

659
00:33:08,732 --> 00:33:09,692
Me too.

660
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:13,972
My car is here. I'm leaving.

661
00:33:52,932 --> 00:33:53,972
Take a photo of me too.

662
00:33:54,452 --> 00:33:55,613
That's enough. It's almost enough.

663
00:33:55,613 --> 00:33:56,293
Let's eat.

664
00:33:56,293 --> 00:33:56,692
Having dinner

665
00:34:04,413 --> 00:34:05,172
Look at this one.

666
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:08,853
It's okay.

667
00:34:08,853 --> 00:34:09,492
Can I...

668
00:34:09,492 --> 00:34:11,053
Turn it again.

669
00:34:32,413 --> 00:34:33,093
not good

670
00:34:33,093 --> 00:34:34,613
This looks like my mother's dress.

671
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:56,053
How about this one?

672
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:05,333
I don't need it.

673
00:35:05,532 --> 00:35:06,492
Work needs.

674
00:35:07,692 --> 00:35:08,532
I'm the leader.

675
00:35:08,532 --> 00:35:09,573
You're not leading the dance.

676
00:35:10,532 --> 00:35:12,212
The leader is the face of a team.

677
00:35:12,212 --> 00:35:14,252
You wear short sleeves and jeans every day.

678
00:35:14,252 --> 00:35:15,012
You're not tired of it.

679
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:15,853
We're all tired of it.

680
00:35:16,293 --> 00:35:16,893
Listen to me.

681
00:35:17,133 --> 00:35:18,252
For a beautiful dress.

682
00:35:40,413 --> 00:35:41,893
Fashion and foreign style.

683
00:35:44,573 --> 00:35:46,732
I think it's not suitable for me.

684
00:35:46,972 --> 00:35:47,853
How could it be?

685
00:35:47,853 --> 00:35:48,972
You have to trust my judgment.

686
00:35:49,653 --> 00:35:50,413
This is it.

687
00:35:52,293 --> 00:35:54,972
Actually, I just checked the label. It's too expensive.

688
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:55,732
Nothing

689
00:35:55,932 --> 00:35:57,252
They said it's 10% off.

690
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:57,932
That's not good.

691
00:35:57,932 --> 00:35:58,613
You can't buy it.

692
00:36:02,573 --> 00:36:03,293
I have a way.

693
00:36:04,373 --> 00:36:05,133
What can I do?

694
00:36:05,492 --> 00:36:06,093
Take a guess.

695
00:36:11,732 --> 00:36:12,413
run

696
00:36:31,132 --> 00:36:31,652
Xiao Feng.

697
00:36:31,652 --> 00:36:32,932
Xiao xiao feng

698
00:36:34,612 --> 00:36:36,012
How could you ask me to steal clothes?

699
00:36:36,572 --> 00:36:37,213
What can we do

700
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:38,333
The clothes are out.

701
00:36:38,932 --> 00:36:39,373
that

702
00:36:39,693 --> 00:36:40,733
Give it back.

703
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:41,452
Surrender oneself

704
00:36:41,452 --> 00:36:42,413
Right now.

705
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:51,213
Why are you laughing?

706
00:36:53,293 --> 00:36:55,052
This is a serious matter.

707
00:36:58,693 --> 00:36:59,452
what

708
00:37:04,173 --> 00:37:05,052
You lied to me.

709
00:37:08,932 --> 00:37:09,932
Don't use any means.

710
00:37:09,932 --> 00:37:11,213
You can't take it off.

711
00:37:13,293 --> 00:37:14,693
What's wrong with you?

712
00:37:16,893 --> 00:37:17,652
Xiao Feng.

713
00:37:19,572 --> 00:37:20,452
Wait a second.

714
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:38,092
Are you all right?

715
00:37:39,853 --> 00:37:41,373
Are you confident of winning the championship?

716
00:37:43,452 --> 00:37:44,733
The champion is important,

717
00:37:45,052 --> 00:37:45,773
but

718
00:37:45,932 --> 00:37:47,572
I have more important things to do now.

719
00:37:48,813 --> 00:37:49,572
what

720
00:37:51,293 --> 00:37:52,932
The day the Inferno competition ended,

721
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:54,413
Many people were crying.

722
00:37:54,932 --> 00:37:56,092
And crying.

723
00:37:57,253 --> 00:37:58,052
At first,

724
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:00,333
I thought it was because they didn't win the championship.

725
00:38:00,932 --> 00:38:02,052
Then I realized

726
00:38:02,132 --> 00:38:03,693
Their future is hopeless.

727
00:38:05,693 --> 00:38:06,572
If you're lucky,

728
00:38:07,092 --> 00:38:08,492
You can still hang it in an Internet café.

729
00:38:09,373 --> 00:38:10,492
Most of the other teams

730
00:38:10,693 --> 00:38:11,373
We are all disbanded.

731
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,853
Actually, I feel bad.

732
00:38:15,492 --> 00:38:16,773
Because we are the same.

733
00:38:17,132 --> 00:38:18,652
And held on.

734
00:38:19,492 --> 00:38:20,572
Understand how hard that is.

735
00:38:21,652 --> 00:38:23,012
So I want to help them.

736
00:38:23,532 --> 00:38:24,813
To help them get a chance.

737
00:38:25,972 --> 00:38:27,052
There's a competition.

738
00:38:27,253 --> 00:38:28,052
And earn money.

739
00:38:28,733 --> 00:38:30,773
You can tell others openly in the future.

740
00:38:31,253 --> 00:38:32,213
Play games.

741
00:38:32,293 --> 00:38:33,333
Is also a profession.

742
00:38:36,253 --> 00:38:37,492
South Korea and Japan

743
00:38:37,492 --> 00:38:39,492
Are exploring e-sports professionalism.

744
00:38:39,733 --> 00:38:40,853
So I believe

745
00:38:40,853 --> 00:38:42,373
Our future is also possible.

746
00:38:44,213 --> 00:38:45,612
It's not possible.

747
00:38:46,213 --> 00:38:47,293
Is a must.

748
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:49,733
Five years and ten years later,

749
00:38:50,052 --> 00:38:51,213
E-sports will be professional.

750
00:38:51,452 --> 00:38:52,612
It's like football and basketball.

751
00:38:53,132 --> 00:38:54,173
There are professional clubs.

752
00:38:54,173 --> 00:38:55,012
Professional League?

753
00:38:55,012 --> 00:38:56,012
And e-sports stars.

754
00:38:56,373 --> 00:38:57,452
I can still support my family.

755
00:38:57,853 --> 00:39:00,213
Are you counting on lucky coins?

756
00:39:00,773 --> 00:39:02,572
Because my friend from the future

757
00:39:02,932 --> 00:39:03,773
He told me.

758
00:39:05,213 --> 00:39:06,373
What else did he say?

759
00:39:06,773 --> 00:39:07,373
He...

760
00:39:08,572 --> 00:39:09,253
He said you can be

761
00:39:09,253 --> 00:39:10,413
The leader of a game company.

762
00:39:11,012 --> 00:39:12,532
In the future, all the e-sports events in China

763
00:39:13,092 --> 00:39:13,853
It's up to you.

764
00:39:16,972 --> 00:39:17,932
What about you?

765
00:39:18,132 --> 00:39:19,452
Did he say anything to you?

766
00:39:19,813 --> 00:39:20,333
I

767
00:39:21,373 --> 00:39:22,612
I'm definitely better than you.

768
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:24,532
And earn a lot of money.

769
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,972
A sports car.

770
00:39:26,693 --> 00:39:27,532
Have a barbecue.

771
00:39:27,972 --> 00:39:28,853
And enjoy the happiness.

772
00:39:32,052 --> 00:39:33,452
Alright, let's go.

773
00:40:08,813 --> 00:40:09,652
I'm back.

774
00:40:09,813 --> 00:40:11,333
Aunts and uncles, we're here.

775
00:40:12,492 --> 00:40:14,052
Son, you're back.

776
00:40:14,052 --> 00:40:14,413
mom

777
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:16,413
We missed you so much.

778
00:40:16,612 --> 00:40:17,853
My son is back.

779
00:40:17,853 --> 00:40:18,492
The champion is back.

780
00:40:18,492 --> 00:40:19,693
Come on, give me a hug.

781
00:40:20,452 --> 00:40:21,813
Congratulations.

782
00:40:22,173 --> 00:40:23,092
leg

783
00:40:23,092 --> 00:40:24,452
Easy, uncle, easy.

784
00:40:24,452 --> 00:40:25,213
Come on.

785
00:40:25,213 --> 00:40:25,972
Give me a hug.

786
00:40:27,253 --> 00:40:28,052
Congratulate

787
00:40:28,052 --> 00:40:28,612
Gently, gently.

788
00:40:29,972 --> 00:40:30,773
I'm telling you,

789
00:40:30,773 --> 00:40:31,932
Today, I will cook it myself.

790
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:33,492
I'll cook some good dishes for you.

791
00:40:33,492 --> 00:40:34,572
Great, Uncle.

792
00:40:34,572 --> 00:40:36,333
I've prepared a hard dish for you.

793
00:40:39,173 --> 00:40:40,492
Amazing

794
00:40:41,693 --> 00:40:42,693
Hurry up. Wash your hands.

795
00:40:42,693 --> 00:40:43,932
Let's eat. Hurry up.

796
00:40:43,932 --> 00:40:45,333
Come on. Congratulations.

797
00:40:45,853 --> 00:40:47,052
And won the championship.

798
00:40:50,413 --> 00:40:50,813
Uncle and aunt.

799
00:40:50,813 --> 00:40:51,773
Did you watch the live stream?

800
00:40:51,773 --> 00:40:52,413
Yes, I have.

801
00:40:52,572 --> 00:40:54,333
We were having a hard time in the final.

802
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:55,532
And turn against the wind.

803
00:40:55,532 --> 00:40:56,572
Control the whole audience.

804
00:40:56,572 --> 00:40:57,333
And won the championship.

805
00:40:58,693 --> 00:41:00,452
You're happy to win the game.

806
00:41:00,652 --> 00:41:01,652
But I think

807
00:41:01,813 --> 00:41:02,932
It's a bit of luck.

808
00:41:03,773 --> 00:41:04,532
Did you calculate it?

809
00:41:04,813 --> 00:41:06,253
One against two, one against three.

810
00:41:06,413 --> 00:41:07,532
How many games have you won?

811
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:16,132
Eleventh game.

812
00:41:17,092 --> 00:41:18,092
There's still one player to four.

813
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:19,293
Think about it.

814
00:41:19,572 --> 00:41:20,932
Which battle in history

815
00:41:21,373 --> 00:41:22,333
The more the less.

816
00:41:22,492 --> 00:41:24,333
The case of the weak defeating the strong.

817
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:25,092
How much is it?

818
00:41:25,293 --> 00:41:26,213
It's rare.

819
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:28,173
So I think

820
00:41:28,532 --> 00:41:30,253
There's something wrong with your tactics.

821
00:41:31,773 --> 00:41:33,572
The team that always wins the game.

822
00:41:33,932 --> 00:41:34,693
It won't be far.

823
00:41:35,052 --> 00:41:36,333
That's what you know.

824
00:41:36,572 --> 00:41:37,333
uncle

825
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:38,452
Please give me your strategy.

826
00:41:38,572 --> 00:41:39,693
What's the problem?

827
00:41:39,893 --> 00:41:41,893
I watched the video of your game repeatedly.

828
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:44,173
You emphasize the attack.

829
00:41:44,452 --> 00:41:45,413
Don't care about defense.

830
00:41:45,773 --> 00:41:47,452
But isn't attacking the best defense?

831
00:41:47,452 --> 00:41:48,413
That's an example.

832
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,612
When your father was a special forces soldier,

833
00:41:51,813 --> 00:41:52,853
Then the instructor told me

834
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:55,693
The offense is the offense and the defense is the defense.

835
00:41:55,693 --> 00:41:57,213
Offense can't replace defense.

836
00:42:00,012 --> 00:42:01,693
We always want to push the opponent to the wall.

837
00:42:02,132 --> 00:42:03,052
Actually,

838
00:42:03,413 --> 00:42:04,612
And got yourself into it.

839
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:05,612
son

840
00:42:05,853 --> 00:42:07,132
You know that.

841
00:42:07,132 --> 00:42:08,813
It means you can go further.

842
00:42:08,972 --> 00:42:10,132
Alright, alright.

843
00:42:10,132 --> 00:42:11,733
Let the children have a good meal.

844
00:42:11,733 --> 00:42:13,293
I heard what you said there.

845
00:42:14,612 --> 00:42:15,092
Xiaobei

846
00:42:15,092 --> 00:42:16,693
You won't leave this time?

847
00:42:17,853 --> 00:42:18,612
If you don't leave this week,

848
00:42:19,293 --> 00:42:20,652
Why don't you leave this week?

849
00:42:22,253 --> 00:42:23,532
We'll return to Shenzhen next week.

850
00:42:26,173 --> 00:42:27,413
Didn't you finish the game?

851
00:42:27,413 --> 00:42:28,293
Why are you still here?

852
00:42:28,853 --> 00:42:29,612
We took it.

853
00:42:29,612 --> 00:42:30,733
Is the champion of semi-professional league.

854
00:42:31,293 --> 00:42:32,092
to accept

855
00:42:32,452 --> 00:42:33,572
It's a professional league.

856
00:42:35,132 --> 00:42:37,293
Why isn't it over?

857
00:42:37,733 --> 00:42:38,572
Crossfire Professional League

858
00:42:38,572 --> 00:42:40,333
Is the top professional league in China.

859
00:42:40,853 --> 00:42:41,932
If you can win the championship,

860
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,612
We can represent China.

861
00:42:43,612 --> 00:42:44,773
To play the World Esports Championship.

862
00:42:44,773 --> 00:42:45,813
Super League

863
00:42:45,932 --> 00:42:47,612
Or even the Asian Games or the Olympics.

864
00:42:48,052 --> 00:42:49,652
When will it stop?

865
00:42:50,572 --> 00:42:52,373
Like a professional athlete.

866
00:42:52,733 --> 00:42:53,853
Until I retire.

867
00:42:54,733 --> 00:42:55,293
mom

868
00:42:55,652 --> 00:42:57,693
Esports is our career now.

869
00:42:58,253 --> 00:42:59,413
I think it's good.

870
00:43:06,652 --> 00:43:07,173
Lieutenant

871
00:43:07,572 --> 00:43:08,413
Take a look at the back.

872
00:43:11,132 --> 00:43:11,773
Lieutenant

873
00:43:13,932 --> 00:43:14,253
good

874
00:43:16,173 --> 00:43:18,213
Captain, what are you doing?

875
00:43:20,813 --> 00:43:22,693
What's going on?

876
00:43:28,012 --> 00:43:28,652
Who is it?

877
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:29,652
Answer it.

878
00:43:30,132 --> 00:43:31,132
To sell insurance.

879
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:32,893
It's annoying.

880
00:43:38,693 --> 00:43:39,333
Brother Feng,

881
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:40,773
Captain, what's going on?

882
00:43:40,773 --> 00:43:42,293
I feel like I've taken the wrong medicine.

883
00:43:42,293 --> 00:43:43,413
There's not a single round.

884
00:43:43,853 --> 00:43:45,293
In his current state,

885
00:43:45,293 --> 00:43:47,052
How can we fight the Dragon Warrior?

886
00:44:30,612 --> 00:44:31,813
Why didn't you answer my calls this afternoon?

887
00:44:34,733 --> 00:44:35,773
It's not convenient.

888
00:44:36,693 --> 00:44:37,612
Has the money been collected?

889
00:44:37,893 --> 00:44:40,132
Give it to me. I'm short of cash.

890
00:44:40,532 --> 00:44:41,813
well

891
00:44:42,532 --> 00:44:43,293
I'm telling you,

892
00:44:43,612 --> 00:44:44,972
Don't let me wait too long.

893
00:44:44,972 --> 00:44:46,932
You will suffer the consequences.

894
00:44:57,733 --> 00:44:58,652
What express?

895
00:44:59,972 --> 00:45:00,813
Valuables

896
00:45:01,253 --> 00:45:02,253
Show me your ID card.

897
00:45:02,413 --> 00:45:03,253
Valuables

898
00:45:20,893 --> 00:45:22,293
How dare you fool me?

899
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:29,452
Give me your ID.

900
00:45:30,052 --> 00:45:31,253
If you want an ID card, you can.

901
00:45:31,773 --> 00:45:32,853
Answer my questions first.

902
00:45:33,413 --> 00:45:34,733
Why did you ask Xu Wei for money?

903
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:35,972
It's none of your business.

904
00:45:36,652 --> 00:45:38,132
Give me my ID card.

905
00:45:38,612 --> 00:45:39,813
Believe it or not, I will kill you.

906
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:43,813
Answer me.

907
00:45:44,572 --> 00:45:45,492
I'm telling you.

908
00:45:45,853 --> 00:45:47,092
He owed me money.

909
00:45:47,652 --> 00:45:48,413
How much do I owe you?

910
00:45:49,052 --> 00:45:49,893
Not much.

911
00:45:50,012 --> 00:45:50,893
It's not much.

912
00:45:51,012 --> 00:45:52,293
You don't have much money. You call me every day to collect debts.

913
00:45:54,652 --> 00:45:55,693
He has paid it off.

914
00:45:56,012 --> 00:45:57,733
I want to collect more interest.

915
00:45:57,733 --> 00:45:58,452
interest

916
00:45:58,612 --> 00:45:59,612
Usury?

917
00:45:59,612 --> 00:46:01,052
Believe it or not, take you to the police station.

918
00:46:01,052 --> 00:46:01,773
I was wrong, brother.

919
00:46:01,773 --> 00:46:03,012
You're wrong. You dare not.

920
00:46:03,012 --> 00:46:03,853
No more.

921
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:06,253
If you don't believe me, give my ID card to Xu Wei.

922
00:46:06,253 --> 00:46:07,213
You asked him to come to me.

923
00:46:07,213 --> 00:46:08,452
Let's write a note.

924
00:46:08,452 --> 00:46:09,893
Can we settle the score?

925
00:46:20,253 --> 00:46:21,373
How did you get this watch?

926
00:46:28,733 --> 00:46:29,693
Do you know him?

927
00:46:32,253 --> 00:46:33,052
I don't know.

928
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:34,253
I've seen him.

929
00:46:35,652 --> 00:46:36,532
He told me everything.

930
00:46:37,052 --> 00:46:37,532
he

931
00:46:37,972 --> 00:46:38,893
What did he say?

932
00:46:39,173 --> 00:46:40,052
Your business.

933
00:46:41,092 --> 00:46:42,333
You still want to hide it from me?

934
00:46:43,253 --> 00:46:44,132
How long do you think you can hide it?

935
00:46:51,652 --> 00:46:52,373
That's enough.

936
00:46:53,092 --> 00:46:54,293
If you need money later,

937
00:46:54,532 --> 00:46:55,693
You can't borrow from him.

938
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:57,813
Take this to him.

939
00:46:58,052 --> 00:46:58,972
Write an IOU.

940
00:46:59,532 --> 00:47:00,452
You don't have to pay the interest.

941
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:05,253
OK!

942
00:47:09,972 --> 00:47:10,773
Welcome back.

943
00:47:10,773 --> 00:47:12,893
The last eight of the National Challenge.

944
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:14,333
The battle now is

945
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:15,693
The Steel Jump Team and the Dragon Warrior Team

946
00:47:16,253 --> 00:47:17,052
Cover for Xiao Feng.

947
00:47:28,293 --> 00:47:29,132
Great. Today,

948
00:47:29,132 --> 00:47:29,853
It's instant.

949
00:47:29,853 --> 00:47:30,452
Fierce

950
00:47:31,813 --> 00:47:33,132
pretty

951
00:47:36,373 --> 00:47:37,693
Come on.

952
00:47:37,693 --> 00:47:39,253
Let's cheer up the team.

953
00:47:44,173 --> 00:47:46,532
I thought the Dragon Warrior was sure to win today.

954
00:47:46,532 --> 00:47:48,693
I didn't expect the team to be so good.

955
00:47:48,693 --> 00:47:50,373
Their previous breakout player is gone.

956
00:47:50,773 --> 00:47:52,532
I thought strength would have an impact.

957
00:47:53,092 --> 00:47:53,932
Don't say that.

958
00:47:53,932 --> 00:47:55,813
The new guy is quite powerful.

959
00:47:55,813 --> 00:47:57,492
Is no worse than the previous Kirin.

960
00:47:57,733 --> 00:47:58,773
Let's go.

961
00:47:59,413 --> 00:48:00,932
Now I'm taking advantage of the momentum

962
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:01,253
OK

963
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:01,853
A wave.

964
00:48:01,932 --> 00:48:03,012
Point A directly.

965
00:48:04,452 --> 00:48:05,293
Old Sha is hiding.

966
00:48:05,532 --> 00:48:06,012
I'm charging.

967
00:48:07,972 --> 00:48:08,893
Captain, head up.

968
00:48:11,173 --> 00:48:11,932
Go forward.

969
00:48:11,932 --> 00:48:12,693
I'll be at the back.

970
00:48:13,532 --> 00:48:14,253
Point A.

971
00:48:22,652 --> 00:48:24,253
Beautiful.

972
00:48:28,492 --> 00:48:29,213
One is missing.

973
00:48:29,213 --> 00:48:30,413
pretty

974
00:48:31,572 --> 00:48:32,693
Hold on.

975
00:48:32,813 --> 00:48:33,452
There's still a chance.

976
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,132
The monkey overshadows him.

977
00:48:36,773 --> 00:48:37,932
pretty

978
00:48:43,092 --> 00:48:43,893
Don't worry.

979
00:48:43,893 --> 00:48:45,492
The monkey is running.

980
00:48:50,173 --> 00:48:51,333
You're so pretty.

981
00:48:51,492 --> 00:48:52,052
Is that okay?

982
00:48:52,253 --> 00:48:52,972
pretty

983
00:48:56,132 --> 00:48:57,052
Go ahead. Go.

984
00:48:57,052 --> 00:48:58,052
The last one.

985
00:48:58,052 --> 00:48:59,052
Come on. Let's go.

986
00:48:59,213 --> 00:49:00,253
Come on. Up.

987
00:49:00,253 --> 00:49:00,893
together

988
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:03,932
Congratulations to Steel Jump Team.

989
00:49:03,932 --> 00:49:05,132
And won the competition.

990
00:49:07,253 --> 00:49:08,853
Beautiful.

991
00:49:17,092 --> 00:49:23,333
The Coin Team.

992
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:24,373
And killed him.

993
00:49:24,452 --> 00:49:25,652
It's beautiful.

994
00:49:25,652 --> 00:49:26,572
pretty
