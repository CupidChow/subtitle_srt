1
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:50,143
Go down.

2
00:02:50,983 --> 00:02:51,622
Hit it!

3
00:02:51,622 --> 00:02:52,823
Hurry up. Go.

4
00:02:52,823 --> 00:02:53,302
Past times

5
00:02:56,823 --> 00:02:57,942
I lost.

6
00:02:58,462 --> 00:02:59,742
It's okay.

7
00:03:00,582 --> 00:03:01,102
Look at this.

8
00:03:02,863 --> 00:03:04,023
Don't tell me.

9
00:03:04,023 --> 00:03:05,743
Thank you, dad.

10
00:03:21,942 --> 00:03:22,702
You won!

11
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,262
pretty

12
00:03:25,223 --> 00:03:26,223
What about

13
00:03:26,382 --> 00:03:27,103
You won?

14
00:03:27,223 --> 00:03:27,863
You won.

15
00:03:29,103 --> 00:03:29,622
remember

16
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,543
We are a team.

17
00:03:32,382 --> 00:03:34,503
Your family will always be your best teammates.

18
00:03:35,063 --> 00:03:35,823
To help each other.

19
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:37,302
To cooperate with each other.

20
00:03:37,822 --> 00:03:38,863
that's right

21
00:03:50,983 --> 00:03:51,863
I'm coming.

22
00:03:51,863 --> 00:03:52,983
Get started.

23
00:03:54,783 --> 00:03:55,582
Go to the left.

24
00:03:55,582 --> 00:03:56,662
Alright.

25
00:03:58,983 --> 00:03:59,302
say

26
00:03:59,903 --> 00:04:00,703
Whose idea?

27
00:04:16,542 --> 00:04:17,703
Why did you take a picture of your forehead?

28
00:04:17,942 --> 00:04:19,582
That's right. Why don't you have me?

29
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:20,703
Let me take a picture of you.

30
00:04:21,022 --> 00:04:21,143
come

31
00:04:35,143 --> 00:04:36,223
The patient suffered from

32
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,022
Prepare to open.

33
00:04:40,742 --> 00:04:41,942
Considering the patient's cardiac arrest

34
00:04:41,942 --> 00:04:42,822
Prepare to deactivate.

35
00:05:28,102 --> 00:05:29,262
Are you Lu Xiaonan's family?

36
00:05:30,503 --> 00:05:32,023
The boy was badly injured.

37
00:05:32,382 --> 00:05:33,223
We tried our best.

38
00:07:12,662 --> 00:07:13,422
Xiao Nan,

39
00:07:14,223 --> 00:07:15,102
What's wrong with you?

40
00:07:15,943 --> 00:07:16,862
I'm your father.

41
00:07:17,622 --> 00:07:18,422
Xiaonan

42
00:07:18,903 --> 00:07:20,143
he

43
00:07:20,143 --> 00:07:21,102
Has left.

44
00:07:27,343 --> 00:07:28,583
You got the wrong doctor.

45
00:07:29,343 --> 00:07:30,182
I won't.

46
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:33,223
I

47
00:07:33,862 --> 00:07:35,583
My son won't leave.

48
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,223
doctor

49
00:07:37,742 --> 00:07:38,783
You got it wrong.

50
00:07:38,862 --> 00:07:40,263
My son is so strong.

51
00:07:40,463 --> 00:07:41,703
He will be fine.

52
00:07:41,703 --> 00:07:42,903
My son is so strong.

53
00:07:42,903 --> 00:07:43,343
he

54
00:07:43,343 --> 00:07:44,343
He won't leave.

55
00:07:44,742 --> 00:07:45,422
doctor

56
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:46,343
You got it wrong.

57
00:07:46,703 --> 00:07:48,263
He can stand up at any time.

58
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:49,703
doctor

59
00:07:49,982 --> 00:07:50,383
Save him.

60
00:07:50,383 --> 00:07:50,783
Lu's dad.

61
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,622
I'm so sorry.

62
00:07:51,622 --> 00:07:52,903
He won't die.

63
00:07:52,903 --> 00:07:54,143
Save him.

64
00:07:54,143 --> 00:07:55,223
Save him.

65
00:08:33,143 --> 00:08:34,463
Xiaonan

66
00:08:37,502 --> 00:08:38,463
You tell me.

67
00:08:38,463 --> 00:08:40,223
You won't have any problem.

68
00:08:42,742 --> 00:08:43,862
You want me?

69
00:08:43,862 --> 00:08:45,783
What should I do?

70
00:08:46,982 --> 00:08:48,862
Dad said you are very obedient.

71
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:50,862
I know you are obedient.

72
00:08:50,862 --> 00:08:52,662
You've always been obedient.

73
00:08:53,862 --> 00:08:55,463
Why are you going out?

74
00:08:56,023 --> 00:08:56,463
I

75
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,703
Dad is here.

76
00:08:59,463 --> 00:09:00,383
Do not

77
00:09:00,383 --> 00:09:02,343
Don't leave home.

78
00:09:06,622 --> 00:09:09,263
son

79
00:09:12,023 --> 00:09:13,383
son

80
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:32,223
We...

81
00:09:33,263 --> 00:09:33,982
I told him

82
00:09:33,982 --> 00:09:35,263
Tell him not to go out.

83
00:09:35,383 --> 00:09:36,383
I told him

84
00:09:36,383 --> 00:09:37,982
I said there's lightning.

85
00:09:38,463 --> 00:09:39,783
I told him

86
00:09:40,143 --> 00:09:41,622
I told him

87
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,343
I told him not to go out.

88
00:09:45,823 --> 00:09:47,223
I

89
00:09:49,662 --> 00:09:51,502
It's my fault.

90
00:09:51,502 --> 00:09:52,862
I'm sorry.

91
00:11:21,343 --> 00:11:22,423
I'll get the beer.

92
00:11:22,742 --> 00:11:24,223
I don't know where Xiao Feng is.

93
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:29,382
dang!

94
00:11:29,943 --> 00:11:31,343
You scared me.

95
00:11:31,343 --> 00:11:32,463
Are you at home?

96
00:11:33,022 --> 00:11:33,862
It's not dark.

97
00:11:33,862 --> 00:11:35,543
Why don't you turn on the light?

98
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:37,663
Why are you all wet?

99
00:11:37,902 --> 00:11:38,902
It's raining.

100
00:11:39,343 --> 00:11:40,223
That's right.

101
00:11:40,223 --> 00:11:41,982
He didn't answer the phone.

102
00:11:41,982 --> 00:11:43,223
Where have you been?

103
00:11:44,463 --> 00:11:45,502
We won today.

104
00:11:45,502 --> 00:11:47,382
Has rushed into the final of Ningjiang District.

105
00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:49,463
Do you know how dangerous it is today?

106
00:11:49,463 --> 00:11:50,303
Without Xu Wei,

107
00:11:50,303 --> 00:11:51,463
We almost lost today.

108
00:11:51,463 --> 00:11:52,343
You know what?

109
00:11:52,343 --> 00:11:53,142
Do you know what the Double Kill Team

110
00:11:53,142 --> 00:11:54,622
How ruthless is that?

111
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:56,102
You're too unreliable.

112
00:11:56,102 --> 00:11:56,902
You are a liar.

113
00:12:00,102 --> 00:12:01,142
I'm a liar.

114
00:12:02,663 --> 00:12:03,782
What's wrong with you?

115
00:12:05,102 --> 00:12:06,423
I'm not just a liar.

116
00:12:08,703 --> 00:12:09,943
I'm still useless.

117
00:12:10,742 --> 00:12:11,543
Xiao Feng.

118
00:12:11,703 --> 00:12:13,303
Are you kidding? Don't be anxious.

119
00:12:13,703 --> 00:12:15,382
I'm nothing.

120
00:12:15,982 --> 00:12:16,823
Big loser.

121
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:17,902
Xiao Feng.

122
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:19,543
Why are you talking nonsense?

123
00:12:21,622 --> 00:12:22,622
Are you all right?

124
00:12:24,102 --> 00:12:25,423
You must be sick from the rain.

125
00:12:28,463 --> 00:12:29,862
I have news for you.

126
00:12:30,782 --> 00:12:31,543
Our opponent

127
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:32,423
Something happened to Team Sky.

128
00:12:33,463 --> 00:12:34,742
What happened?

129
00:12:34,902 --> 00:12:37,303
Their leader, Lu Xiaonan was involved in a car accident.

130
00:12:37,303 --> 00:12:38,622
I heard she hasn't been rescued yet.

131
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:16,063
Xiaobei

132
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:17,343
You're awake.

133
00:13:17,823 --> 00:13:18,782
Mom is here.

134
00:13:18,782 --> 00:13:19,502
Mom

135
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,663
Where's my brother?

136
00:13:31,663 --> 00:13:32,502
Dad

137
00:13:32,663 --> 00:13:33,823
Where's my brother?

138
00:13:47,463 --> 00:13:49,543
Mom, where is my brother?

139
00:13:49,782 --> 00:13:50,423
Xiaobei

140
00:13:51,102 --> 00:13:52,463
I'm right next door.

141
00:13:52,782 --> 00:13:54,102
When we're done,

142
00:13:54,102 --> 00:13:55,583
You can go to see your brother.

143
00:13:56,183 --> 00:13:57,303
I'm going to see him.

144
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,543
Go now.

145
00:14:01,463 --> 00:14:02,343
My legs.

146
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:03,463
What's wrong with my leg?

147
00:14:03,902 --> 00:14:04,622
Nothing

148
00:14:05,343 --> 00:14:06,102
Don't cry.

149
00:14:06,223 --> 00:14:07,303
Listen to me.

150
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,223
The doctor said

151
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,703
As long as we cooperate with the treatment,

152
00:14:09,703 --> 00:14:11,102
You can go to the field soon.

153
00:14:11,303 --> 00:14:12,622
We can go to find Brother.

154
00:14:12,622 --> 00:14:13,262
all right?

155
00:14:15,223 --> 00:14:15,943
Don't cry.

156
00:14:19,022 --> 00:14:19,703
Xiaobei

157
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:20,663
see

158
00:14:20,982 --> 00:14:21,782
What is this?

159
00:14:23,782 --> 00:14:24,223
My brother said

160
00:14:24,223 --> 00:14:25,382
This is your favorite.

161
00:14:25,463 --> 00:14:26,782
Let me give this to you.

162
00:14:29,183 --> 00:14:30,262
To cheer you up.

163
00:15:29,902 --> 00:15:30,663
Where are you going?

164
00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:32,423
I'll ask him to go.

165
00:15:33,423 --> 00:15:34,543
Xiao Bei said he wouldn't go.

166
00:15:34,742 --> 00:15:35,223
For more than ten years,

167
00:15:35,223 --> 00:15:36,142
He never went there.

168
00:15:53,423 --> 00:15:54,183
hi

169
00:15:58,183 --> 00:15:59,502
Time and space rescue plan.

170
00:15:59,943 --> 00:16:00,823
I failed.

171
00:16:05,022 --> 00:16:06,102
The game is over.

172
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:09,742
When you died,

173
00:16:12,223 --> 00:16:13,703
I didn't shed a single tear.

174
00:16:16,262 --> 00:16:18,022
I don't even know what death is.

175
00:16:22,183 --> 00:16:22,823
later

176
00:16:25,742 --> 00:16:26,902
I opened the shoe closet.

177
00:16:29,982 --> 00:16:31,303
I saw your sneakers.

178
00:16:34,343 --> 00:16:35,343
I realized that

179
00:16:39,782 --> 00:16:41,543
No one will ever wear it again.

180
00:16:47,183 --> 00:16:48,343
It turns out that

181
00:16:50,663 --> 00:16:52,022
Not disappear for a while.

182
00:16:55,463 --> 00:16:57,022
But to disappear for a lifetime.

183
00:16:58,663 --> 00:16:59,303
Brother

184
00:17:01,022 --> 00:17:02,663
I couldn't save you.

185
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,183
I am sorry

186
00:17:08,943 --> 00:17:10,183
The only chance.

187
00:17:24,902 --> 00:17:26,382
You can go to the game.

188
00:18:04,423 --> 00:18:05,382
It's delicious.

189
00:18:09,303 --> 00:18:09,982
Lieutenant

190
00:18:10,543 --> 00:18:11,663
It's a compliment.

191
00:18:11,663 --> 00:18:12,543
It's you.

192
00:18:13,063 --> 00:18:14,543
The shots fired yesterday

193
00:18:14,543 --> 00:18:15,622
He's not a human.

194
00:18:15,622 --> 00:18:16,943
You're amazing, you know?

195
00:18:16,943 --> 00:18:17,782
That's amazing.

196
00:18:18,303 --> 00:18:19,183
I'll never dare to

197
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:20,022
In front of you.

198
00:18:20,303 --> 00:18:21,862
From now on, you will be the God in my heart.

199
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:23,142
pretty

200
00:18:24,622 --> 00:18:25,063
It's delicious.

201
00:18:25,982 --> 00:18:26,622
Eat more.

202
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:27,543
And took it away?

203
00:18:27,543 --> 00:18:28,382
I'm here.

204
00:18:28,862 --> 00:18:29,943
I'll give you some.

205
00:18:30,423 --> 00:18:30,982
Hold on.

206
00:18:31,262 --> 00:18:31,982
Don't you want to eat maple?

207
00:18:32,303 --> 00:18:33,502
You won't leave any for me.

208
00:18:34,703 --> 00:18:35,423
Under the meat.

209
00:18:35,902 --> 00:18:36,382
Take that.

210
00:18:36,543 --> 00:18:38,022
Captain, that's really...

211
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,943
admire

212
00:18:39,183 --> 00:18:39,583
Eat more.

213
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,142
I just got the news.

214
00:18:42,742 --> 00:18:44,982
Our final opponent, Team Sky,

215
00:18:46,823 --> 00:18:47,502
Abstained.

216
00:18:48,543 --> 00:18:49,943
So according to the schedule,

217
00:18:49,943 --> 00:18:51,622
We won the championship in Ning Jiang Team.

218
00:18:55,943 --> 00:18:57,543
I don't know whether to be happy.

219
00:18:57,543 --> 00:18:58,703
You shouldn't be happy.

220
00:18:59,142 --> 00:19:00,742
Their team is so unlucky.

221
00:19:01,382 --> 00:19:02,782
If that's the case,

222
00:19:02,782 --> 00:19:04,862
I think our championship is a bit...

223
00:19:05,183 --> 00:19:06,423
It makes me uncomfortable.

224
00:19:08,183 --> 00:19:09,543
Anything unexpected may happen

225
00:19:09,663 --> 00:19:11,183
It's a blessing or a misfortune.

226
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,502
Things change.

227
00:19:12,502 --> 00:19:13,543
It's also fate.

228
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,343
At least we won the championship.

229
00:19:15,663 --> 00:19:16,262
Be happy.

230
00:19:16,262 --> 00:19:17,022
Yes, be happy.

231
00:19:18,022 --> 00:19:19,502
Brother Feng, do you know?

232
00:19:19,902 --> 00:19:21,502
The captain is amazing.

233
00:19:21,742 --> 00:19:22,742
Yesterday, Captain,

234
00:19:22,742 --> 00:19:24,502
The endgame is 3 to 4.

235
00:19:24,742 --> 00:19:25,543
Gun, gun. Head shot.

236
00:19:25,543 --> 00:19:26,423
You're amazing.

237
00:19:27,262 --> 00:19:28,663
The captain is very powerful.

238
00:19:28,663 --> 00:19:30,102
It's better than hanging up.

239
00:19:32,663 --> 00:19:33,343
Old Xiao.

240
00:19:33,663 --> 00:19:34,423
What are you doing?

241
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:35,862
Come and have a bite.

242
00:19:35,862 --> 00:19:36,622
Eat something.

243
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:38,423
To be so deep.

244
00:19:38,742 --> 00:19:39,342
What's up

245
00:19:39,663 --> 00:19:40,663
Are you jealous of me?

246
00:19:56,223 --> 00:19:56,863
Yummy

247
00:19:57,943 --> 00:19:59,103
I'm going out to do something.

248
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,022
Don't you want to eat?

249
00:20:00,262 --> 00:20:00,982
Where are you going?

250
00:20:02,223 --> 00:20:03,183
Where are you going?

251
00:20:04,863 --> 00:20:05,863
And mysterious.

252
00:20:31,822 --> 00:20:33,022
I'm looking for Lu Xiao Bei.

253
00:20:33,342 --> 00:20:34,822
You're the captain of the Steel Coin Team.

254
00:20:34,822 --> 00:20:35,663
Shaw

255
00:20:35,663 --> 00:20:36,663
Xiao Feng.

256
00:20:36,663 --> 00:20:37,502
Come in.

257
00:20:46,383 --> 00:20:47,943
Aunts and uncles went to eat.

258
00:20:47,943 --> 00:20:48,742
Xiao Bei just went to bed.

259
00:20:49,062 --> 00:20:49,742
Nothing

260
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:50,703
Don't bother him.

261
00:20:50,703 --> 00:20:51,663
I'll be leaving soon.

262
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,623
Sit down.

263
00:21:02,982 --> 00:21:03,463
All of you

264
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:04,423
A member of Team Sky?

265
00:21:05,582 --> 00:21:06,183
Yes

266
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:07,703
Xiao Nan is our captain.

267
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:10,822
You're good at fighting.

268
00:21:11,663 --> 00:21:12,703
It's a pity that Lu Xiaonan

269
00:21:13,903 --> 00:21:14,943
Go out.

270
00:21:20,262 --> 00:21:21,742
Don't do that in front of Xiao Bei.

271
00:21:21,742 --> 00:21:23,103
To mention Xiao Nan's leaving.

272
00:21:23,623 --> 00:21:24,582
He doesn't know.

273
00:21:24,943 --> 00:21:26,502
My aunt and uncle told me

274
00:21:26,502 --> 00:21:28,423
When Xiao Bei is better,

275
00:21:28,423 --> 00:21:29,143
And find a chance to say it.

276
00:21:31,782 --> 00:21:32,863
How is his injury?

277
00:21:33,302 --> 00:21:34,703
His legs were badly injured.

278
00:21:35,302 --> 00:21:36,502
The doctor said

279
00:21:36,502 --> 00:21:38,342
You may be in a wheelchair forever.

280
00:22:08,582 --> 00:22:09,302
Xiaobei

281
00:22:13,502 --> 00:22:14,262
time

282
00:22:14,502 --> 00:22:15,223
place

283
00:22:15,223 --> 00:22:16,863
I've told you all the details.

284
00:22:16,863 --> 00:22:17,943
Why can't I stop it?

285
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:20,302
Why can't I stop it?

286
00:22:22,022 --> 00:22:23,062
I thought blocking Nanshan Road

287
00:22:23,062 --> 00:22:24,022
Nothing will happen.

288
00:22:24,822 --> 00:22:27,022
Is it so hard to stop a game?

289
00:22:27,022 --> 00:22:28,262
Is it that hard?

290
00:22:41,183 --> 00:22:41,782
Xiaobei

291
00:22:43,423 --> 00:22:45,183
You never told me about your legs.

292
00:22:45,903 --> 00:22:47,423
How are your legs now?

293
00:22:47,423 --> 00:22:48,143
Are you okay?

294
00:22:52,223 --> 00:22:53,342
My legs are fine.

295
00:22:55,502 --> 00:22:57,143
It has been in a wheelchair all its life.

296
00:22:59,703 --> 00:23:01,022
But what does that mean?

297
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:05,183
I'll be in a wheelchair forever. I can't get my brother back.

298
00:23:08,623 --> 00:23:10,183
It's all my fault.

299
00:23:11,863 --> 00:23:13,183
If I hadn't pestered him,

300
00:23:14,582 --> 00:23:16,223
If I hadn't gone to the game with him,

301
00:23:17,582 --> 00:23:19,062
If I let him wear the helmet,

302
00:23:19,062 --> 00:23:19,982
He won't die.

303
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:20,782
You know what?

304
00:23:20,782 --> 00:23:22,223
He won't die.

305
00:23:22,663 --> 00:23:24,502
I thought I could have saved him.

306
00:23:25,582 --> 00:23:27,582
I thought I could stop this.

307
00:23:29,183 --> 00:23:29,703
But in the end,

308
00:23:29,703 --> 00:23:30,663
I can't do anything.

309
00:23:30,822 --> 00:23:36,903
I can't do anything.

310
00:23:36,903 --> 00:23:38,582
I'll do anything.

311
00:23:38,582 --> 00:23:40,262
I can't do it.

312
00:23:58,542 --> 00:24:00,143
I didn't even go to his funeral.

313
00:24:05,183 --> 00:24:06,822
I haven't even seen him for the last time.

314
00:24:09,262 --> 00:24:09,943
Xiaobei

315
00:24:13,742 --> 00:24:14,982
Stop looking for me.

316
00:24:18,822 --> 00:24:20,463
I don't want to see you again in my life.

317
00:25:15,342 --> 00:25:15,943
Good morning.

318
00:25:19,782 --> 00:25:20,582
96 points.

319
00:25:20,782 --> 00:25:22,703
4 points above the grade average.

320
00:25:22,703 --> 00:25:23,742
We don't have to drop out of school together.

321
00:25:25,582 --> 00:25:26,302
Congratulations.

322
00:25:27,782 --> 00:25:28,502
What's up

323
00:25:29,022 --> 00:25:29,863
Are you sick?

324
00:25:37,183 --> 00:25:37,943
You know that.

325
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,143
I don't like to owe people favors.

326
00:25:40,143 --> 00:25:41,022
This is

327
00:25:41,022 --> 00:25:41,782
No need

328
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:44,703
I'm a cripple in a wheelchair.

329
00:25:51,903 --> 00:25:52,663
The director asked you two

330
00:25:52,663 --> 00:25:54,143
Take the exam paper to his office.

331
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:57,822
Director

332
00:25:58,103 --> 00:26:00,183
Chuge has been working very hard recently.

333
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,262
We can see all these.

334
00:26:02,262 --> 00:26:04,423
You've only been a head teacher for a few years.

335
00:26:04,423 --> 00:26:06,342
I've been teaching for 20 years.

336
00:26:06,663 --> 00:26:08,143
What are the students hiding?

337
00:26:08,143 --> 00:26:10,183
I can see clearly in my stomach.

338
00:26:10,183 --> 00:26:12,262
She was the last in her class last month.

339
00:26:12,262 --> 00:26:13,782
This month is above the average.

340
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:14,742
She took a rocket.

341
00:26:14,903 --> 00:26:15,663
She took a rocket.

342
00:26:15,663 --> 00:26:17,383
She can't get such a high score.

343
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:18,663
Anyway, I didn't cheat.

344
00:26:19,022 --> 00:26:20,262
I answered the paper myself.

345
00:26:21,943 --> 00:26:25,062
Look, the second question of the third question

346
00:26:25,062 --> 00:26:26,262
You both did wrong.

347
00:26:26,863 --> 00:26:27,502
You did it wrong.

348
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:28,982
You said you didn't cheat.

349
00:26:30,183 --> 00:26:30,703
Lu Xiao Bei,

350
00:26:30,703 --> 00:26:31,582
Tell the truth.

351
00:26:31,663 --> 00:26:33,663
Did Chu Jiang copy your exam paper?

352
00:26:33,663 --> 00:26:34,502
Chu song

353
00:26:35,223 --> 00:26:36,223
It's possible.

354
00:26:37,183 --> 00:26:38,663
I only focused on the answers during the exam.

355
00:26:39,863 --> 00:26:40,863
What are you talking about?

356
00:26:41,342 --> 00:26:42,342
Who copied yours?

357
00:26:42,342 --> 00:26:43,703
What did I say?

358
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:44,703
CHUJIANG

359
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:45,822
Stop making excuses for me.

360
00:26:45,822 --> 00:26:47,463
Get your parents here.

361
00:26:48,663 --> 00:26:49,342
Lu Xiao Bei,

362
00:26:49,663 --> 00:26:50,982
Be realistic.

363
00:26:51,223 --> 00:26:52,903
It's easy to prove it.

364
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:53,982
Let her do it again.

365
00:26:55,423 --> 00:26:57,022
I'm afraid you won't dare.

366
00:26:57,703 --> 00:26:58,582
Just do it.

367
00:26:59,143 --> 00:27:00,183
This paper is not good.

368
00:27:00,663 --> 00:27:01,943
Just take one.

369
00:27:01,943 --> 00:27:02,943
The real exam.

370
00:27:03,463 --> 00:27:04,582
And see how well she can score.

371
00:27:05,183 --> 00:27:06,143
I'll do as you said.

372
00:27:06,663 --> 00:27:07,262
CHUJIANG

373
00:27:07,262 --> 00:27:08,103
Chu song

374
00:27:09,183 --> 00:27:10,183
the same

375
00:27:10,782 --> 00:27:12,663
If you can still get this mark,

376
00:27:13,822 --> 00:27:15,542
I will hold the throne in front of you.

377
00:27:31,863 --> 00:27:33,262
Are you trying to get back at me?

378
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:37,903
Director

379
00:27:38,342 --> 00:27:39,103
It's done.

380
00:27:44,342 --> 00:27:44,703
you

381
00:27:45,143 --> 00:27:46,342
You're wrong.

382
00:27:47,782 --> 00:27:49,903
This is the 2015 math exam.

383
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:51,782
The standard answers are all here.

384
00:27:51,782 --> 00:27:53,463
Why don't you repeat it yourself?

385
00:27:57,663 --> 00:27:58,863
You two go back to class.

386
00:28:07,903 --> 00:28:08,822
Wait a second.

387
00:28:11,782 --> 00:28:12,463
Director

388
00:28:12,782 --> 00:28:14,143
We're just joking.

389
00:28:14,143 --> 00:28:15,502
Why should you take it seriously?

390
00:28:15,663 --> 00:28:16,223
No

391
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:18,383
I will do what I say.

392
00:28:19,502 --> 00:28:19,943
you

393
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:20,943
Let go of me.

394
00:28:20,943 --> 00:28:21,822
I'll do it myself.

395
00:28:24,062 --> 00:28:24,663
good

396
00:28:31,022 --> 00:28:32,103
I promised you

397
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,262
As long as Xiao Bei is in the top ten,

398
00:28:34,742 --> 00:28:35,822
The achievement of Chuge has reached

399
00:28:35,822 --> 00:28:37,183
Grade Average Scores

400
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:38,262
I'll change your seats.

401
00:28:38,502 --> 00:28:39,423
Now?

402
00:28:39,423 --> 00:28:40,183
Do you still want to change?

403
00:28:44,903 --> 00:28:45,423
change

404
00:28:46,103 --> 00:28:48,183
You can stay at the same table.

405
00:28:48,183 --> 00:28:50,383
You two are making progress together recently.

406
00:28:50,383 --> 00:28:51,342
And help each other.

407
00:28:51,342 --> 00:28:52,223
It worked well.

408
00:28:52,463 --> 00:28:53,223
I want to change it.

409
00:28:56,863 --> 00:28:57,342
Change it.

410
00:29:11,943 --> 00:29:12,582
Al-Amin

411
00:29:12,582 --> 00:29:13,742
Are you ready?

412
00:29:13,742 --> 00:29:14,903
Right away.

413
00:29:15,143 --> 00:29:15,863
Don't rush me.

414
00:29:20,183 --> 00:29:20,742
roll

415
00:29:21,143 --> 00:29:22,342
Holding a mirror all day long.

416
00:29:22,342 --> 00:29:22,742
Take photos.

417
00:29:22,742 --> 00:29:24,542
I stuck my hair.

418
00:29:24,982 --> 00:29:25,822
What should I do?

419
00:29:26,943 --> 00:29:28,943
Captain, captain.

420
00:29:28,943 --> 00:29:30,542
What do you think of my outfit?

421
00:29:30,542 --> 00:29:31,342
Handsome

422
00:29:31,342 --> 00:29:31,943
Is he handsome?

423
00:29:31,943 --> 00:29:32,782
Is that cool?

424
00:29:33,143 --> 00:29:33,742
Handsome

425
00:29:33,742 --> 00:29:34,342
Take a good look.

426
00:29:34,943 --> 00:29:36,423
How about this?

427
00:29:36,822 --> 00:29:37,342
Brother Feng,

428
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:39,143
Can you get your hair done?

429
00:29:39,143 --> 00:29:39,903
And change your clothes.

430
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,663
We are going to receive the award later.

431
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:44,463
Please guess.

432
00:29:44,463 --> 00:29:45,502
This National Challenge

433
00:29:45,502 --> 00:29:46,782
How much is the winner's bonus?

434
00:29:49,943 --> 00:29:50,982
The bonus plan has come out.

435
00:29:52,183 --> 00:29:53,943
The championship bonus of this year's professional league is...

436
00:29:55,342 --> 00:29:55,742
Ten thousand.

437
00:29:56,903 --> 00:29:57,463
Twenty thousand.

438
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:58,022
It's less.

439
00:29:58,943 --> 00:29:59,623
Or not.

440
00:29:59,742 --> 00:30:00,623
How much is it?

441
00:30:03,982 --> 00:30:04,782
100 thousand yuan.

442
00:30:05,183 --> 00:30:06,223
One million.

443
00:30:06,223 --> 00:30:06,982
Dollar

444
00:30:07,863 --> 00:30:08,582
That's a lot.

445
00:30:08,582 --> 00:30:09,623
100 thousand yuan?

446
00:30:11,703 --> 00:30:12,863
And if you take the King of the Golden Spear,

447
00:30:12,863 --> 00:30:14,302
That man can get another 50,000.

448
00:30:14,302 --> 00:30:15,822
The King of the Golden Spear, $400,000.

449
00:30:16,062 --> 00:30:17,143
At the current exchange rate,

450
00:30:17,502 --> 00:30:19,342
9.6 million yuan?

451
00:30:19,542 --> 00:30:21,143
And made a fortune.

452
00:30:22,183 --> 00:30:23,782
Money is like rubbish.

453
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:25,463
Even if it's 100 million,

454
00:30:25,463 --> 00:30:27,943
It has nothing to do with you.

455
00:30:28,423 --> 00:30:28,982
master

456
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:30,742
That's not necessarily true.

457
00:30:31,943 --> 00:30:32,463
Also

458
00:30:32,943 --> 00:30:34,782
I've made a calculation for you.

459
00:30:34,782 --> 00:30:36,463
The train takes the cheapest hard seat.

460
00:30:36,463 --> 00:30:37,502
The whole team went back and forth.

461
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,903
It costs 1,700 and 60 yuan.

462
00:30:39,062 --> 00:30:39,903
Plus,

463
00:30:39,903 --> 00:30:41,183
Each of you will get a set of

464
00:30:41,183 --> 00:30:42,262
Mouse keyboard headset

465
00:30:42,262 --> 00:30:43,623
It costs 2,000 yuan.

466
00:30:43,623 --> 00:30:44,943
Meals and transportation within the city.

467
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:46,223
It's 3500 yuan.

468
00:30:46,223 --> 00:30:47,342
And before the competition,

469
00:30:47,342 --> 00:30:48,623
The cost of living during this period.

470
00:30:48,623 --> 00:30:50,463
If you can't get 35,000 yuan,

471
00:30:50,463 --> 00:30:51,502
No matter how good you are,

472
00:30:51,502 --> 00:30:52,623
I have no chance to prove myself.

473
00:30:53,262 --> 00:30:54,903
There is a cost to winning the championship.

474
00:30:55,383 --> 00:30:56,463
that

475
00:30:56,463 --> 00:30:57,383
That's a lot.

476
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:01,463
You...

477
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,223
I have 20,000 yuan.

478
00:31:03,383 --> 00:31:04,342
Take the flowers first.

479
00:31:04,742 --> 00:31:06,342
I'll figure out a way.

480
00:31:06,943 --> 00:31:07,822
Where did you get the money?

481
00:31:08,903 --> 00:31:09,943
I sold the car.

482
00:31:12,542 --> 00:31:13,542
You sold the car.

483
00:31:14,022 --> 00:31:15,463
She doesn't drive much.

484
00:31:15,463 --> 00:31:16,623
Every month,

485
00:31:16,623 --> 00:31:18,423
And the insurance will be burned.

486
00:31:18,822 --> 00:31:20,223
People are more important than cars.

487
00:31:20,223 --> 00:31:21,943
The money will last for a while.

488
00:31:22,223 --> 00:31:23,223
But what should we do then?

489
00:31:23,822 --> 00:31:25,502
To go further,

490
00:31:25,742 --> 00:31:27,223
You're not enough.

491
00:31:27,223 --> 00:31:28,342
And you are a poor student.

492
00:31:29,423 --> 00:31:30,383
We are nothing.

493
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:32,623
I don't have any money.

494
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:34,703
But I can help you find the money.

495
00:31:35,183 --> 00:31:36,383
You're the sponsor?

496
00:31:38,342 --> 00:31:39,582
You need a leader.

497
00:31:39,582 --> 00:31:40,863
It's like a basketball team, a football team.

498
00:31:40,863 --> 00:31:41,502
The leader.

499
00:31:41,502 --> 00:31:43,342
To help you solve all your worries.

500
00:31:43,542 --> 00:31:45,022
So that you can focus more on

501
00:31:45,022 --> 00:31:46,582
Put it on the training and competition.

502
00:31:46,582 --> 00:31:47,223
AnLuan

503
00:31:47,782 --> 00:31:49,223
If you can really get the sponsorship,

504
00:31:49,463 --> 00:31:50,742
Just be our leader.

505
00:31:51,463 --> 00:31:52,223
It's a deal

506
00:31:52,423 --> 00:31:54,582
Then let's go and accept the award.

507
00:31:54,582 --> 00:31:55,463
I'm going to do something.

508
00:31:56,502 --> 00:31:57,103
Where are you going?

509
00:31:57,103 --> 00:31:57,943
What's so important?

510
00:31:57,943 --> 00:31:58,943
It's not easy for us to get it.

511
00:31:58,943 --> 00:31:59,982
The champion of the division.

512
00:31:59,982 --> 00:32:00,703
Why are you leaving?

513
00:32:00,703 --> 00:32:02,742
It's a big day for the team.

514
00:32:02,742 --> 00:32:03,342
That's right.

515
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:04,903
You're our captain.

516
00:32:04,903 --> 00:32:06,223
You have to help us get the award.

517
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,742
What's wrong with him recently?

518
00:32:08,742 --> 00:32:09,623
You're so mysterious.

519
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:17,423
Restrain one's grief and accord with inevitable changes

520
00:32:19,623 --> 00:32:20,502
Please forgive me.

521
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:05,223
This is the last bottle today.

522
00:33:05,663 --> 00:33:06,703
You will be discharged soon.

523
00:33:07,183 --> 00:33:08,022
The head nurse said

524
00:33:08,022 --> 00:33:09,502
You need to get used to the wheelchair.

525
00:33:10,302 --> 00:33:11,742
I won't take it. Push it away.

526
00:33:13,223 --> 00:33:14,183
Where's my mom?

527
00:33:14,903 --> 00:33:17,423
They said the office would come later.

528
00:33:18,103 --> 00:33:19,262
Is my brother feeling better?

529
00:33:19,703 --> 00:33:20,822
It's better now.

530
00:33:20,822 --> 00:33:22,183
Can he speak now?

531
00:33:22,423 --> 00:33:23,703
Can I see him?

532
00:33:23,943 --> 00:33:24,822
Not yet.

533
00:33:25,342 --> 00:33:26,982
You need to wait for him to recover for a while.

534
00:33:27,302 --> 00:33:28,943
When will it be?

535
00:33:28,943 --> 00:33:30,183
I want to go now.

536
00:33:30,183 --> 00:33:31,742
You can just take a look from a distance.

537
00:33:32,463 --> 00:33:33,302
Almost there.

538
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:34,782
Wait for him to leave the ICU.

539
00:33:34,982 --> 00:33:37,463
Didn't she leave the ICU a few days ago?

540
00:33:38,582 --> 00:33:39,223
That's right.

541
00:33:39,223 --> 00:33:41,062
He's transferred to the intensive care unit.

542
00:33:41,863 --> 00:33:43,262
The water is ready for you.

543
00:33:43,262 --> 00:33:44,623
You need to go to the bathroom later.

544
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:45,542
Remember to press the call.

545
00:34:44,423 --> 00:34:46,183
Xiao Bei wants to see his brother again.

546
00:34:46,183 --> 00:34:47,782
I said his brother is in intensive care.

547
00:34:47,782 --> 00:34:48,903
He immediately responded.

548
00:34:48,903 --> 00:34:49,383
say

549
00:34:49,383 --> 00:34:51,183
Weren't you in the ICU the other day?

550
00:34:51,782 --> 00:34:53,143
Why didn't you be careful?

551
00:34:54,463 --> 00:34:56,183
Xiao Bei, why are you out?

552
00:34:56,183 --> 00:34:57,542
Where is my brother?

553
00:34:57,742 --> 00:34:59,262
Your brother is in the intensive care unit.

554
00:34:59,262 --> 00:35:00,302
Go back.

555
00:35:00,822 --> 00:35:01,822
Xiao Bei, where are you going?

556
00:35:01,822 --> 00:35:03,502
Hurry, hurry. Go and stop him.

557
00:35:03,822 --> 00:35:04,822
Where are you going?

558
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:05,423
Xiaobei

559
00:35:05,423 --> 00:35:07,262
Go away

560
00:35:07,262 --> 00:35:07,863
Xiaobei

561
00:35:07,863 --> 00:35:08,623
Behave yourself.

562
00:35:08,623 --> 00:35:09,542
Let's go back.

563
00:35:10,022 --> 00:35:11,103
Go away

564
00:35:11,103 --> 00:35:12,062
Xiao Bei. Little North.

565
00:35:12,062 --> 00:35:14,223
I'm going to see my brother.

566
00:35:14,223 --> 00:35:15,062
Xiao Bei, listen to me.

567
00:35:15,062 --> 00:35:16,103
Go away

568
00:35:16,103 --> 00:35:17,502
Take me to see my brother.

569
00:35:17,502 --> 00:35:18,183
I'll take you there.

570
00:35:37,062 --> 00:35:37,703
Xiaobei

571
00:35:39,302 --> 00:35:40,022
Go inside.

572
00:36:06,943 --> 00:36:07,663
Xiaobei

573
00:36:08,103 --> 00:36:09,143
Why are you here?

574
00:36:10,542 --> 00:36:11,863
Find your brother.

575
00:36:17,782 --> 00:36:19,542
I'll show you.

576
00:36:32,262 --> 00:36:32,903
come

577
00:36:33,143 --> 00:36:34,143
Talk to your brother.

578
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:40,463
Brother

579
00:36:43,262 --> 00:36:44,382
Brother

580
00:36:44,382 --> 00:36:45,503
Say something.

581
00:36:46,382 --> 00:36:47,822
I'm Xiao Bei.

582
00:36:47,822 --> 00:36:49,462
Did you hear that?

583
00:36:49,462 --> 00:36:50,782
Get up.

584
00:36:50,782 --> 00:36:52,342
Don't lie in it.

585
00:36:52,342 --> 00:36:54,143
Come home with me.

586
00:36:54,543 --> 00:36:55,223
Brother

587
00:36:55,902 --> 00:36:56,703
Brother

588
00:36:57,223 --> 00:36:58,742
Get up.

589
00:37:00,063 --> 00:37:03,342
Don't lie there.

590
00:37:05,262 --> 00:37:06,822
Come on, Xiao Bei. I'll take you with me.

591
00:37:06,822 --> 00:37:08,623
I'll take you with me.

592
00:37:08,623 --> 00:37:11,342
Brother

593
00:37:21,422 --> 00:37:24,742
Brother

594
00:37:25,422 --> 00:37:27,703
Dad

595
00:37:27,942 --> 00:37:31,143
I don't want my brother to leave me.

596
00:37:31,302 --> 00:37:33,342
I don't want him to leave.

597
00:37:34,143 --> 00:37:37,023
I want him to be with me.

598
00:37:37,902 --> 00:37:39,422
He won't leave us.

599
00:37:47,742 --> 00:37:49,503
He won't leave us.

600
00:37:50,822 --> 00:37:52,503
Didn't you say that?

601
00:37:53,703 --> 00:37:54,862
We are a team.

602
00:37:55,782 --> 00:37:56,742
Is a family.

603
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:07,742
The family will always

604
00:38:07,742 --> 00:38:09,422
We should always be together.

605
00:38:09,422 --> 00:38:10,262
Right?

606
00:38:12,543 --> 00:38:14,302
We will always be together, right?

607
00:40:30,223 --> 00:40:30,983
Xiaobei

608
00:40:35,223 --> 00:40:36,302
I'll take you to a place.

609
00:41:00,462 --> 00:41:01,302
didn't expect

610
00:41:02,342 --> 00:41:03,503
You still have these things?

611
00:41:30,782 --> 00:41:32,302
Brother, what does this mean?

612
00:41:32,942 --> 00:41:34,623
Continue.

613
00:42:00,302 --> 00:42:01,262
Xiaobei

614
00:42:01,262 --> 00:42:02,862
Take the left, I'll take the right.

615
00:42:02,862 --> 00:42:03,543
Alright.

616
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:07,543
The monster is here.

617
00:42:07,543 --> 00:42:08,342
Put on a big move. Put a big move on.

618
00:42:18,983 --> 00:42:20,143
Your father is really old.

619
00:42:20,782 --> 00:42:21,782
I can't keep up.

620
00:42:25,703 --> 00:42:26,503
One more.

621
00:42:28,422 --> 00:42:29,223
One more.

622
00:42:30,103 --> 00:42:31,143
Don't tell me.

623
00:42:31,462 --> 00:42:32,422
I won't tell you.

624
00:42:42,262 --> 00:42:43,583
stick

625
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,342
pretty

626
00:42:45,942 --> 00:42:47,262
We are a team.

627
00:42:48,302 --> 00:42:50,023
Your family will always be your best teammates.

628
00:42:51,103 --> 00:42:51,782
To help each other.

629
00:42:52,302 --> 00:42:53,302
To cooperate with each other.

630
00:42:53,822 --> 00:42:54,862
Cooperate with each other.

631
00:42:58,422 --> 00:42:59,902
Although there's one missing,

632
00:43:00,422 --> 00:43:01,902
So we should be united.

633
00:43:04,223 --> 00:43:04,983
son

634
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,822
Dream is a good thing.

635
00:43:08,703 --> 00:43:10,623
Catch it. Don't give up.

636
00:43:10,862 --> 00:43:12,422
No one wants you to let go.

637
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:14,543
Even your father

638
00:43:15,422 --> 00:43:17,183
If e-sports is your dream,

639
00:43:17,742 --> 00:43:18,782
Do it boldly.

640
00:43:25,862 --> 00:43:26,503
yes

641
00:43:27,663 --> 00:43:28,342
captain

642
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,183
Keep up.

643
00:44:09,183 --> 00:44:09,663
Hurry up.

644
00:44:09,663 --> 00:44:10,623
The left is coming.

645
00:44:11,623 --> 00:44:13,623
I just found a place to take photos of headshots.

646
00:44:13,623 --> 00:44:14,663
Let's take photos later.

647
00:44:15,543 --> 00:44:16,023
Alright.

648
00:44:29,902 --> 00:44:30,862
Hi.

649
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:33,742
I'm here to talk to you.

650
00:44:34,782 --> 00:44:35,703
To say goodbye.

651
00:44:38,703 --> 00:44:40,382
I worked hard before.

652
00:44:42,143 --> 00:44:44,223
I want to finish the regret you left.

653
00:44:44,663 --> 00:44:46,422
I thought it was your best memory.

654
00:44:47,902 --> 00:44:49,623
It's silly to think about it now.

655
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:53,742
I almost forgot myself.

656
00:44:55,023 --> 00:44:56,422
Why do you like e-sports?

657
00:44:57,942 --> 00:44:59,422
No wonder my parents are worried.

658
00:45:00,822 --> 00:45:02,262
I'm living in your shadow.

659
00:45:04,503 --> 00:45:05,422
But don't worry.

660
00:45:06,942 --> 00:45:08,103
I will come out.

661
00:45:10,983 --> 00:45:13,583
I'm starting a new life.

662
00:45:15,782 --> 00:45:16,462
This time,

663
00:45:21,462 --> 00:45:22,862
Is really going to continue.

664
00:45:26,782 --> 00:45:27,942
Bye, brother.

665
00:45:30,103 --> 00:45:31,223
I'll think about you in the future.

666
00:45:34,223 --> 00:45:35,503
I'll visit you in the graveyard.

667
00:45:48,342 --> 00:45:49,023
hi

668
00:45:49,382 --> 00:45:50,143
Sorry, brother.

669
00:45:50,902 --> 00:45:52,543
Your computer was taken away by dad.

670
00:45:52,782 --> 00:45:53,623
You know that.

671
00:45:53,942 --> 00:45:55,462
No one can find what he hid.

672
00:45:59,902 --> 00:46:00,462
Brother

673
00:46:00,663 --> 00:46:01,902
These days,

674
00:46:02,543 --> 00:46:03,583
And met a more special girl.

675
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:04,543
I won't be destroyed.

676
00:46:05,503 --> 00:46:06,422
I will...

677
00:46:06,983 --> 00:46:07,742
Certain

678
00:46:08,663 --> 00:46:09,663
Will become stronger.
