1
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,560
This game is ours.

2
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:52,160
Don't give Langya a chance.

3
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,799
We defeated them in Hundred Cities.

4
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,559
They will doubt their lives today.

5
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:57,880
That was the past.

6
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,039
Last time Langya lost to us,

7
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:01,560
Because you underestimated the enemy.

8
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,560
The mistakes made by the opponent.

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,119
We can't do it again.

10
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,120
Who let you in?

11
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,199
Get out

12
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:10,760
You must have made a mistake.

13
00:02:11,079 --> 00:02:12,600
This is the first time

14
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:13,399
Do you know

15
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,640
Get out

16
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,960
We're here.

17
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,719
Is it your turn?

18
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,359
President Guo promised us personally.

19
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,039
Then ask him to tell me in person.

20
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:28,439
sorry

21
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,640
The subscriber you dialed is temporarily unavailable.

22
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,600
Come on.

23
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,439
Stop fighting.

24
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:33,840
He won't answer your calls.

25
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,359
I'm the captain.

26
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,439
I'm the boss here.

27
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:37,799
You really treat yourself like a monkey?

28
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,000
And want to do somersaults.

29
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,200
Let's have a look.

30
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,280
Welcome to

31
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,319
Half professional league Tencent e-sports games

32
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,000
Summer Finals 2020

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,519
The competition of crossing the line of fire.

34
00:02:58,799 --> 00:02:59,920
The two competitors

35
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,159
Has come to the scene.

36
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:03,200
This is the Langya League from Ningjiang.

37
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,760
Captain and sniper Peng

38
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,280
Breaking through the zero point of the hand.

39
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:07,799
Breakout Artist Hulk

40
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:09,319
Breakthrough player Bboy

41
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,840
After the accident,

42
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,120
All right, now,

43
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,799
Is a local team from Shenzhen.

44
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:15,640
Southern monster

45
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:16,920
Sniper X L.

46
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,400
The breakout player, Lincoln.

47
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,719
Breakout player black

48
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,359
Breakthrough Player Mee2

49
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:22,680
Breaking Queen Eagle

50
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:23,920
Welcome.

51
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,400
Xiaobei

52
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:46,879
President Guo is inside.

53
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:51,959
President Guo.

54
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,040
Don't you want to explain?

55
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,719
I know you want to play.

56
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,800
But Liu Xu has more experience in the competition.

57
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,159
I've been thinking about it.

58
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,599
This game is crucial.

59
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,199
It's not the time to steal the limelight.

60
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,879
We're not trying to steal the limelight.

61
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,240
As far as I know,

62
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,000
They must have figured out all of Liu Xu's tactics.

63
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,240
Don't try to persuade me.

64
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,319
I have something to do.

65
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,479
You said it well yesterday.

66
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:17,680
Why did you change your mind today?

67
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,199
It must be Liu Xu behind it.

68
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,120
Come with me.

69
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,560
fast

70
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,520
left

71
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,759
You played well.

72
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,639
pretty

73
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,719
Mee2 is repositioning.

74
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,400
It's so beautiful.

75
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,960
Was also killed by Peng.

76
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,960
The Langya Alliance is very clean.

77
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,840
Take this round off.

78
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,560
The wolf tooth looks good.

79
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,360
Get rid of him.

80
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:10,400
Drop it.

81
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,120
Light him.

82
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:12,759
Head shot.

83
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:14,199
Good for you.

84
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,319
She's here.

85
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:19,960
There's another one.

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,039
pretty

87
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:43,439
pretty

88
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,439
Do you think

89
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,400
Liu Xu has problems today.

90
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,280
Is it because of injury?

91
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,080
impossible

92
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,080
After all, Liu Xu has beaten

93
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,240
For hundreds of competitions.

94
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,680
Even if the condition is not right,

95
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:57,319
You won't lose your basic consciousness.

96
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,120
He is now

97
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:00,879
Langya almost every round,

98
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,800
Can find a breakthrough from him.

99
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,520
At point A.

100
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,120
Past times

101
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,839
on

102
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,680
What are you doing?

103
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,680
captain

104
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,759
What are you doing?

105
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:16,439
What the hell is Liu Xu doing?

106
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,839
President Guo.

107
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,319
President Guo.

108
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
Liu Xu's condition is not right.

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The wolf is in good condition.

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,040
It's normal to keep it.

111
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,079
But I don't think I can't.

112
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,680
But someone intentionally missed the guard.

113
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,680
What do you mean?

114
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,279
I don't know what happened.

115
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,480
But I know

116
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,160
If we fight like this,

117
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,120
The game will be lost.

118
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,279
Liu Xu,

119
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,680
And experienced rough times.

120
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,040
The previous competition

121
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,920
More behind.

122
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,720
You've recovered.

123
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,279
Langya is the best at downwind.

124
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,800
They are getting stronger now.

125
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,000
If you don't make any adjustment,

126
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,879
There's really no chance.

127
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,439
I know.

128
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,600
Go back first.

129
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,519
At point A,

130
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,480
Past times

131
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,240
Get rid of him.

132
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,160
pretty

133
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,199
It seems that this southern monster

134
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,720
I still can't find the offensive condition.

135
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,920
Was taken down by Langya again.

136
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,079
The first overall situation of the two sides

137
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:08,800
The Langya League

138
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,560
With a score of 10 to 2.

139
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,279
I've done enough acting.

140
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,759
Don't let them see it.

141
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,720
So what if I see it?

142
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,600
I'm not staying anyway.

143
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,160
Remember to give your team

144
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,279
Leave it to me.

145
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,360
Don't release it.

146
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,000
Don't investigate.

147
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,439
The game is about to begin.

148
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:38,279
Come on in.

149
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:39,319
Thank you.

150
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,319
You won.

151
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,839
Today is good.

152
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:22,759
Wear three.

153
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:23,839
You're amazing.

154
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,519
What you did just now

155
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:28,639
I have to pick up someone.

156
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,360
Who are you calling?

157
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,720
Why is there no signal?

158
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,040
Changsha

159
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,600
Are you Chang Sha's friend?

160
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,399
I remember you.

161
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:38,879
Do you still remember me?

162
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,079
I'm so honored.

163
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,480
Kirin, you played so well today.

164
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,040
Play it normally.

165
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,439
Where is Chang Sha?

166
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:46,800
He didn't play well today.

167
00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:48,120
The captain scolded him and ran away.

168
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:49,680
Are you drinking water?

169
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:51,759
Thank you

170
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,040
Then I'm glad.

171
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,480
Remember the mouse.

172
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:58,120
Pack your things.

173
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:00,959
I'll answer the phone.

174
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,240
feed

175
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,600
A busy man.

176
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,879
You took so long to answer my call.

177
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:15,920
On purpose?

178
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,480
I was busy just now.

179
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,399
what?

180
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,399
I've been short of money recently.

181
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,759
Lend me some.

182
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,160
I've given you everything I should.

183
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,600
What else do you want from me?

184
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,199
The matter between us has been settled.

185
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,839
I've done so much for you.

186
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,399
You use that money to shut my mouth.

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,560
Don't you worry?

188
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:33,800
I have no money.

189
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,920
There's no money now.

190
00:09:35,439 --> 00:09:36,040
I'm telling you,

191
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,319
I have something on you.

192
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:38,839
I can make you

193
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:40,199
Slip away from the police.

194
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,319
I can send it back to you.

195
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:41,879
Do you believe that?

196
00:09:42,439 --> 00:09:43,480
You're a murderer.

197
00:09:44,439 --> 00:09:45,720
I'm telling you for the last time.

198
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:47,519
I've given you what I should give you.

199
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,800
Don't come to me again.

200
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,800
It's settled.

201
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:53,680
Who's calling?

202
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:55,959
The agent is selling houses.

203
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:56,839
Harassment calls.

204
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,839
I can't afford it.

205
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,519
Let's go.

206
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,680
Get rid of him.

207
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,799
Now let's play the game.

208
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,879
Can it be brought back?

209
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,120
It's difficult.

210
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,440
But you can try.

211
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,000
I know.

212
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,559
We had some misunderstandings.

213
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,919
Don't take it to heart.

214
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,519
I also want to

215
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,039
President Guo.

216
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,639
We are part of the team.

217
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:48,960
It's my duty to help the team.

218
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:50,759
I'll suspend the game.

219
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,600
Brothers,

220
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,120
Get ready to work.

221
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,840
All the monsters in the South are replaced.

222
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,320
I need to stop the game.

223
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,639
Time is running out.

224
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,759
Are you sure that

225
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,679
determine

226
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,360
Stay close to me.

227
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,360
Xiaokk

228
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,200
To get rid of him.

229
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,360
The game is suspended.

230
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,000
The whole team of Southern Monsters is replaced.

231
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,039
OK

232
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,960
We just got the latest news.

233
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,440
Southern Monster asked for a team substitution.

234
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:34,639
What?

235
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,039
Did I hear it wrong?

236
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,480
The monster of the South actually carried out

237
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,039
The adjustment of team substitution.

238
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,000
To replace all the five main players.

239
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,240
They just played.

240
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,120
There's no time to warm up.

241
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,759
You must play defense.

242
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,200
We're feeling hot now.

243
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,120
While they're still standing,

244
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,799
With all your strength.

245
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,080
To win this game.

246
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,639
Come back

247
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:52,159
I'll buy you drinks.

248
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,000
Received, received.

249
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,559
With your stinking fish and shrimps,

250
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,879
You want to turn the table?

251
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,480
Go to the middle. They just

252
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,600
Received

253
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,399
We lost one in the middle.

254
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:22,799
pretty

255
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:29,519
pretty

256
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,519
Hold still

257
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:33,039
OK

258
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:33,720
We can see that

259
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,120
Southern Monster scores in a row

260
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,519
With a score of 10 to 8,

261
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:38,120
And won the second game.

262
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,440
Then let's have a look.

263
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,840
Can the southern monster be staged?

264
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,080
The final magical reversal.

265
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,559
Let's wait and see.

266
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,039
They are anxious.

267
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,840
We're in no hurry.

268
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,200
Three in the middle.

269
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:57,399
We lost one in the middle.

270
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:58,279
I'll load it. Help me.

271
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,000
Received

272
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,759
Now we come to the match point of the third round.

273
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:03,039
The monster in the South is setting the bag.

274
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:05,159
The Langya Team is rushing to Anbao Point.

275
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,720
The monster in the south dropped one.

276
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,080
Back, back.

277
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,080
Come on.

278
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:11,080
Another one.

279
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:11,679
pretty

280
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,320
It's a success.

281
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,799
Hold still

282
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,080
Now the Southern Monsters give the Langfang Team

283
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,240
Caused a lot of pressure.

284
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,720
Warehouse B is here.

285
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,759
go

286
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:19,960
The two sides have entered a stalemate.

287
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,120
The wolf's teeth are flashing.

288
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,799
It was flashed.

289
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:26,600
They're overcast.

290
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,879
I'll throw it in as bait.

291
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,240
Go!

292
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:30,679
It's white.

293
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:31,159
punching

294
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,600
Both sides launched fierce attacks.

295
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,759
The scene was so chaotic.

296
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,039
One of his teeth was knocked out.

297
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,080
Be careful

298
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,799
The Southern Monster successfully counterattacked.

299
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,000
And won the game.

300
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,120
very good

301
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:46,559
pretty

302
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,679
Congratulations.

303
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,799
Hao, wait a second.

304
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:05,159
Nezha, protection deity

305
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:11,399
good

306
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,039
After this match,

307
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:18,919
The Southern Monster will sign a formal contract with them.

308
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,840
To win this game.

309
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,080
They're still at the bottom.

310
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:24,000
It's good to avoid relegation.

311
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,519
But seriously,

312
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,240
I'm quite interested in that boy.

313
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,360
I really hope

314
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,159
They can enter the Crossfire Professional League.

315
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,960
I will fight with him then.

316
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,799
Into the Crossfire League.

317
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:45,639
Be careful.

318
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:46,480
Be careful

319
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,120
Come with me.

320
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,799
Alright.

321
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:56,879
very good

322
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,720
I finally have my own room.

323
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:07,000
sea

324
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,159
Sundowners

325
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:57,840
Thank you

326
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,399
You played well.

327
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:03,279
Let's play together.

328
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,799
Alright.

329
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:09,639
Liu Xu is finished.

330
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,960
And dragged us into it.

331
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,320
What should we do now?

332
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:15,440
And discuss it with President Guo.

333
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,240
What are we talking about?

334
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,840
The room has been vacated.

335
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:22,720
Why are you here?

336
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,600
If you're here for a joke,

337
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:26,080
Please stay away.

338
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,519
actually

339
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm here to invite you to stay.

340
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:36,759
Why do you still keep them?

341
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:37,720
Why should I?

342
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,600
You forgot the anger we suffered here.

343
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,480
You can't live by holding a grudge.

344
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,600
Besides,

345
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,639
They are different from Liu Xu.

346
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,720
I hope the team can get good results.

347
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,399
President Guo promised to play the main role.

348
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:50,240
Why did you keep them?

349
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,240
How many of them

350
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:53,919
Know about semi-league.

351
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:55,799
The style and condition of each team.

352
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,039
More experienced than us.

353
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,360
The hole they stepped on

354
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,480
To avoid a detour.

355
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,480
Can help us.

356
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,320
and

357
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,200
Southern monster

358
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,919
Now it's a broken ship.

359
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,679
Liu Xu cut a big hole just now.

360
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,039
If you want to finish faster,

361
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:09,440
We need help.

362
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,879
The five of us will work together.

363
00:17:14,879 --> 00:17:15,960
Isn't that enough?

364
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,879
No matter how sharp the knife is,

365
00:17:17,879 --> 00:17:19,120
We also need a whetstone.

366
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:23,320
I just can't swallow it.

367
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,279
And swallowed the air.

368
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,519
Your mind will be wider.

369
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,440
That Su Jiayi

370
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,120
You need to swallow more.

371
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,919
Chuge, let's go together.

372
00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:53,080
This canvas bag looks nice.

373
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,120
It's expensive, right?

374
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:56,600
Milk from the supermarket.

375
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,360
You like milk?

376
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,679
The supermarket is having a sale.

377
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:02,440
What do you like to drink?

378
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,919
milk

379
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:07,159
Chu song

380
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:08,559
Let's go to the canteen together.

381
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,679
I'm not hungry.

382
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:10,200
Eat it.

383
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,559
I'm leaving now.

384
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,120
Chu song

385
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:20,039
Then your face

386
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:23,639
Like the calm waves,

387
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,320
Let the mind full of shackles

388
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,759
To be liberated.

389
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,519
Did you see it?

390
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:37,600
I said we are vulnerable.

391
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,799
In countless times of fear,

392
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:44,120
And recognize yourself.

393
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,240
You will definitely see

394
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,600
I can't fight back.

395
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,599
This is a heart that loves you.

396
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,559
nothing

397
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,039
Don't stop.

398
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,319
Why are you free?

399
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,160
I'm worried.

400
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,599
Why should I worry?

401
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,359
I'm not worried about you.

402
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:10,000
I'm worried about the teachers and students of Southern Sports.

403
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,880
I was harmed by you.

404
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,559
From your club.

405
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:14,599
It's more than 50 yuan.

406
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,440
Spend 50 yuan to get beaten here.

407
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:17,880
It's not worth it.

408
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,960
There are so many students.

409
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:24,799
Why are you here alone?

410
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:29,960
They're too slow.

411
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,359
We can't go together.

412
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,039
eldest brother

413
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,759
I'm not asking you to compete with them.

414
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:37,160
Relax.

415
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,359
Running with everyone.

416
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:42,759
Talking about others behind their backs.

417
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:45,480
The hexagram of the girl next door.

418
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:47,319
This is university life.

419
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,480
It doesn't sound interesting.

420
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,480
You think it's boring?

421
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,960
That's because you haven't tried.

422
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:57,680
You worked so hard to get into the Southern Sports University.

423
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,640
Is it just for that diploma?

424
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,880
Try to make friends with everyone.

425
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,839
You won't regret it.

426
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:06,559
I tried.

427
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,200
But I don't think I can fit in.

428
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,960
That's because

429
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,440
They don't know you well enough.

430
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,519
Don't put yourself

431
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:18,359
So tight.

432
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,759
Look.

433
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,559
I've known you for so long.

434
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,200
I didn't know until today.

435
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:24,880
You sing so well.

436
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,160
Enough

437
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,200
Class,

438
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,279
Twenty-third

439
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:54,759
Southern Sports Campus Singing Contest

440
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:56,359
The registration has started.

441
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:57,599
You are welcome to join us.

442
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:58,880
Sing the song of youth.

443
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,200
Sing yourself.

444
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,680
Are you going to sign up?

445
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,319
Class,

446
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:05,119
Welcome to the singing contest.

447
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:06,160
Sing the song of youth.

448
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,519
Sing yourself.

449
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:09,000
Classmate

450
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,160
Are you going to sign up?

451
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,119
Is the phone number here?

452
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,480
Name and class.

453
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,799
Contact information is enough.

454
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,640
I've already filled in the phone number. Can you...

455
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,119
You're a freshman of Management School, right?

456
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:25,440
I saw you at the welcome party.

457
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:26,160
Well

458
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:27,359
This singing competition

459
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:28,720
Was organized by our art troupe.

460
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,359
I'm the leader of the art troupe.

461
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:31,119
My name is Gao Bosong.

462
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,200
And Level 17 of your management department.

463
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:34,680
Hello, Senior Brother.

464
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,240
Don't be so courteous.

465
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,079
We are classmates.

466
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:43,519
one's master's/teacher's son who is older than oneself

467
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:45,200
What can you fill in the competition declaration?

468
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,440
It's done, right?

469
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,799
We are like

470
00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:59,960
In the melody,

471
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,720
I will never pay you.

472
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:17,000
I can't forget every time I miss you

473
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,039
Is too real.

474
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,319
I begin to doubt that without your story,

475
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:26,000
When I look back at you,

476
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Can't you see the result?

477
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,240
I was lonely all the time.

478
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,519
I can't find the meaning.

479
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,880
I just passed by.

480
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,119
I heard someone singing.

481
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,480
You sing well.

482
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,759
I didn't expect you

483
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:47,920
No

484
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,440
I was afraid of affecting me.

485
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,279
In the dorm.

486
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:51,440
That's why I'm here.

487
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:53,640
If you want to practice singing,

488
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,880
I have the key card of the piano room.

489
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,920
I can take it there.

490
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,160
No need

491
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,279
it doesn't matter

492
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,079
They're not here.

493
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:00,680
Let's go.

494
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,000
I've checked your registration form.

495
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,440
Your name is Chu Ge, right?

496
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,720
This is where the art troupe usually rehearses.

497
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:19,319
What about you?

498
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:20,799
Just stay here and practice the song.

499
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:29,200
If I remember correctly,

500
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:32,559
You should be the second preliminary.

501
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,559
Are you ready to sing this song?

502
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,119
I haven't figured it out yet.

503
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,319
Because I watched the game.

504
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,960
I think they are very capable.

505
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:51,400
The singing,

506
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:53,519
The most important thing is to sing happily.

507
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,799
The purpose of holding the singing contest

508
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:57,200
To give you

509
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,279
Show your stage.

510
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,279
Come on.

511
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,440
I can't forget every time I miss you

512
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,440
Is too real.

513
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,720
I'm starting to doubt it.

514
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,440
Your company completed the story.

515
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,759
When I look back at you,

516
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:28,440
Can't you see the result?

517
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,440
we

518
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,680
Has always been

519
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,119
alone

520
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,319
Thank you for treating me.

521
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:47,440
Thank you for eating with me.

522
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:49,400
With you,

523
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:51,240
I'm very happy.

524
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,519
Me too.

525
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:55,079
That's it.

526
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:55,920
Go back.

527
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,400
You still need to train.

528
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,839
that

529
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,440
Our next match

530
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,680
Will you still come?

531
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,759
Of course I will.

532
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:08,920
Go back.

533
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,640
That

534
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:18,960
Are we friends now?

535
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:20,319
Of course.

536
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,880
Then I'm leaving.

537
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,519
bye-bye

538
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,359
Come and hit me.

539
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,519
You're all here.

540
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:22,119
Old Sha is back.

541
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,440
I thought you weren't coming back.

542
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,279
The three of us are going to stay up all night.

543
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,400
How could I not come back?

544
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,000
Where can I go if I don't come back?

545
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:30,720
You and that girl named Qiqi

546
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,880
Are getting along well with each other.

547
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,359
bachelors

548
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,559
干柴烈火的

549
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,319
Don't guess.

550
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,599
we

551
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,720
Just a friend.

552
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,119
Since you came out,

553
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:46,599
It must have been four hours.

554
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:47,680
What have you done in the last four hours?

555
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:49,880
It's Kirin's third fan.

556
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,160
Don't talk nonsense.

557
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,200
I can't either.

558
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:54,039
Old sand.

559
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,799
How about the girl named Qiqi?

560
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,599
It's over 85.

561
00:26:57,759 --> 00:26:58,440
How is it going?

562
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,359
Stop guessing.

563
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,359
Don't ask.

564
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:04,960
Did you kiss her?

565
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,839
You shouldn't have

566
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:12,880
I didn't hug you.

567
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,319
Are you holding hands?

568
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,400
we

569
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,000
We're just eating and chatting.

570
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,960
I didn't do anything else.

571
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:25,440
Don't think too much.

572
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,519
It's not what you think.

573
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:29,839
get up

574
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,039
I'm asking you to get up.

575
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:32,599
Get up.

576
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,480
Changsha

577
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:36,559
Are we...

578
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,960
What's wrong with her?

579
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,319
I know a hospital.

580
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,759
another day

581
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:43,359
I'll take you to check.

582
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,599
I am.

583
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,480
Namely

584
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,839
When I saw her,

585
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:55,119
I can't remember anything.

586
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,640
And if I can't see her,

587
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,200
I really want to see her.

588
00:27:58,359 --> 00:27:59,920
If she is far away,

589
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,480
I will feel that she is shining.

590
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:04,799
And when she was close to me,

591
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,960
Right next to her.

592
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:08,480
There is a circle one meter in diameter.

593
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,880
I will be so happy when I touch that circle.

594
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,200
And then I can't say anything.

595
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:18,799
I've never had this feeling before.

596
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,599
You wouldn't understand.

597
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,000
It's not as complicated as you think.

598
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,599
That

599
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:28,000
Xiao Feng is looking for me.

600
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,720
About tomorrow.

601
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,000
Don't guess.

602
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,319
So happy.

603
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:39,599
It's boring. I'll go back to sleep.

604
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,759
Come on.

605
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:43,480
It must be your wife's job.

606
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,880
She is looking to the leader of the family.

607
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,000
Report the work.

608
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,279
You know what?

609
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,359
Look, look.

610
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:56,000
Hello, honey.

611
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,400
No.

612
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:59,599
I'll talk to you in my room.

613
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,920
good

614
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,240
They're all gone.

615
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:05,640
No one to play with me.

616
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:07,119
It's okay. I'll play with you.

617
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,119
but

618
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,400
I'll get some water first.

619
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,759
Alright. Go.

620
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:11,839
Hold on.

621
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,359
Have you seen my phone?

622
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:36,839
It's here.

623
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,079
You've texted me back.

624
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:45,480
come

625
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:45,920
good

626
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,279
We've watched the video three times.

627
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,759
They know everything.

628
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:49,440
Well

629
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,039
Their focus is on snipers.

630
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,640
Take out their snipers.

631
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,440
Their team, Xiao Si,

632
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:55,880
Old Sha, today,

633
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,160
That's right.

634
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,079
Then let's go.

635
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:00,039
Let's practice.

636
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,599
What time is it?

637
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:04,519
The Kirin hasn't come yet.

638
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:05,960
We've finished the meeting.

639
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,160
He said he had a pain in his back.

640
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:10,400
Went to the bone-setting hospital to find a doctor.

641
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:12,839
I told him to exercise more.

642
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:13,599
I won't listen.

643
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:15,119
I'll get him two sets of plasters later.

644
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:16,839
Let's go.

645
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,119
Computer Science

646
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,359
Did something grow on my face?

647
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,319
No

648
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:39,640
Qiqi

649
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,400
Sorry.

650
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,559
There's a traffic jam.

651
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,759
Have a seat.

652
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,920
Where is Chang Sha?

653
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:46,759
he

654
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:48,880
The captain asked him to train temporarily today.

655
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:50,240
I'll teach you today.

656
00:31:58,039 --> 00:31:59,400
So professional.

657
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,960
I said the competition committee will give us

658
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,640
This training room is really nice.

659
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,880
The key is to provide drinks.

660
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:09,480
feed

661
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:11,960
Is my computer fixed?

662
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,599
I'm anxious to use it.

663
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:15,359
Three days?

664
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:17,720
Can you hurry up?

665
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,759
You can pay more.

666
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,400
As long as we fix it right away.

667
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,920
Okay, I'll be waiting for your call.

668
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:29,400
Your antique is finally broken.

669
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,279
That's right.

670
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:33,880
Finally, it can't stand my torture.

671
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,200
And protested to me.

672
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,319
After the competition,

673
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:39,440
Let's buy a new one for you.

674
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,640
I'm

675
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,119
to remember old friends

676
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,640
Come on.

677
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,640
Black Town

678
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,839
Are you in the room?

679
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:06,759
I have to tell you something.

680
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:07,839
What's wrong?

681
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:08,839
Mysterious.

682
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,599
Kirin didn't go to the hospital.

683
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:12,480
He has a date with a girl.

684
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,039
I see

685
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,880
That girl

686
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,640
It's Qiqi who is always with you.

687
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,039
He didn't want me to tell you.

688
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,319
But I think

689
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,200
He can't go on like this.

690
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,839
Where are they?

691
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:32,119
Come on, Qiqi.

692
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:33,680
One more cup.

693
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,880
I really can't drink any more.

694
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,559
Master, pour some wine for you.

695
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:38,480
How dare you not drink it?

696
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,599
I

697
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,720
I did it.

698
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,200
Make yourself at home.

699
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,519
pretty

700
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,720
It's good.

701
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,319
Seven seven.

702
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,480
You...

703
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:06,200
Go.

704
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,920
Don't drink too much.

705
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,559
get up

706
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,200
One more cup.

707
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,119
It's done.

708
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:20,920
What are you doing?

709
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,000
What do you mean?

710
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:23,720
Why are you here?

711
00:34:23,759 --> 00:34:25,079
What do you mean?

712
00:34:25,799 --> 00:34:27,559
Aren't we the same?

713
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:31,400
Don't touch her.

714
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,480
Look how you drank her.

715
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,640
Qiqi

716
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:37,400
Are you all right?

717
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,440
If something happens to her,

718
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,839
I'm not finished with you.

719
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:43,119
Why can't I touch her?

720
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,680
She didn't have your name engraved on her body.

721
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:48,960
I like her.

722
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,359
I like her.

723
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:56,839
what?

724
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:00,319
You still want to fight me?

725
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:02,400
Can you chase a girl?

726
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,839
What are you doing?

727
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,720
I will beat you to death.

728
00:35:06,759 --> 00:35:07,960
I will fight with you.

729
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,519
Yes?

730
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,680
Did you hit me?

731
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,039
I will beat you to death.

732
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,240
I kissed him.

733
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,000
Help!

734
00:35:17,279 --> 00:35:17,920
you

735
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:18,680
Stop fighting.

736
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,200
Unicorn

737
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:19,680
Stop fighting.

738
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,039
Don't hit me again.

739
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,799
Kirin, stop it.

740
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,359
Kirin, calm down.

741
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,480
Are you all right?

742
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:43,440
Don't move.

743
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:51,960
Nothing

744
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,000
You attacked me first.

745
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,680
What are you wearing?

746
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,079
It's okay. I'm going back.

747
00:35:59,199 --> 00:35:59,920
Did I ask you to leave?

748
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,760
What do you mean?

749
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,960
Old Sha likes that girl.

750
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,599
You know, right?

751
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:05,280
I know.

752
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,840
Do you know that you asked Lao Sha out?

753
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:07,840
I like it,too

754
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,280
fair competition

755
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,280
What's wrong?

756
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:10,960
Besides,

757
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,760
Chang Sha and the girl

758
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,000
Is just a common friend.

759
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,280
what?

760
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,840
If he can ask me out, he can't.

761
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:15,880
If you say that,

762
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,039
Aren't you ashamed?

763
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,000
Unicorn

764
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,199
Don't play dumb with me.

765
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:19,800
What are you doing?

766
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,760
You know that.

767
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,960
There are so many girls. Don't you chase them?

768
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,239
You don't rob your own brothers.

769
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:23,960
What did I do?

770
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,679
I had a drink with that girl.

771
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:26,760
Nothing serious.

772
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,079
If you like it, go after it.

773
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,400
I'll give it to you.

774
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:30,440
Wait a second.

775
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,039
What now?

776
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:34,880
You haven't apologized to Chang Sha.

777
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,280
What are you apologizing for?

778
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,159
You're sorry to Chang Sha today.

779
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,280
You must apologize to him.

780
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:41,360
Don't cry.

781
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,599
Does it have anything to do with you?

782
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:44,639
Of course.

783
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:46,400
I'm the leader of the Steel Coin Team.

784
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,199
You should know that you're the leader of the team.

785
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,119
Just do what your leader should do.

786
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,559
What happened between our brothers

787
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:52,800
Don't interfere.

788
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:54,159
If you don't apologize today,

789
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:55,960
Don't play tomorrow.

790
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:58,800
Who are you to stop me from playing?

791
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,400
What are you doing?

792
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:01,400
As the leader,

793
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,760
I have the power to punish

794
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,679
And punished.

795
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,760
Xiao Feng.

796
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,559
What does that mean?

797
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,280
What does that mean?

798
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,679
That's all I have.

799
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,800
You don't have to make a fuss.

800
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,719
Say something.

801
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,639
You didn't do it well.

802
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:41,400
Apologize to Lao Sha.

803
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,639
Are you protecting him?

804
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:43,280
Okay, Kirin.

805
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:45,440
What are you doing?

806
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,280
Enough?

807
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,719
Old Sha likes such a girl.

808
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,719
You made him angry.

809
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,400
You're so

810
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,960
Apologize to Lao Sha now.

811
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:52,559
Let's call it a day.

812
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:54,119
Don't mention anyone, okay?

813
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,559
I can see that.

814
00:37:58,679 --> 00:37:59,880
You guys get together now.

815
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,159
To deal with me alone?

816
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,280
Not against you.

817
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,400
There's a rule for everything.

818
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,079
principle

819
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,559
You're talking about principles.

820
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,679
It's okay if you two go after one girl.

821
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:08,880
Chang Sha and I are chasing a girl.

822
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,480
It's a matter of principle.

823
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,320
What you said are two different things.

824
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,239
You are allowed to set the fire.

825
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:12,480
You don't allow me to light a light?

826
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,400
Are you finished?

827
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,679
And then I'll apologize to Lao Sha.

828
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:16,079
I won't apologize today.

829
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:16,559
What?

830
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:17,280
Are you serious?

831
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:17,920
I won't.

832
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,719
Are you serious?

833
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:19,440
I won't.

834
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,119
Are you serious?

835
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:21,159
Have you two had enough?

836
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:24,519
I'm still the same.

837
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:25,679
If you don't apologize today,

838
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:27,559
Don't play tomorrow.

839
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,280
good

840
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,159
can

841
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:42,360
Don't you want me to play?

842
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:45,280
I'll quit the team today.

843
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,639
And never play again.

844
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,440
Without me,

845
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,480
How to play this game?
