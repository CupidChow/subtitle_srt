Only one player with the best performance

00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:55,281
To sign a contract with Gravity.

20
00:00:55,281 --> 00:00:56,921
And become a professional.

21
00:03:48,881 --> 00:03:50,361
Xiangxiang, help us jam the path.

22
00:03:50,361 --> 00:03:50,921
I'm going to the middle.

23
00:03:51,122 --> 00:03:52,081
Received

24
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:51,202
There's someone in the back.

25
00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:52,001
Xiangzi went under the contract.

26
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:52,561
We'll set it up for you.

27
00:06:52,882 --> 00:06:53,601
Alright.

28
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,121
They came from A.

29
00:06:58,121 --> 00:06:58,801
good

30
00:06:58,801 --> 00:06:59,601
One off.

31
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:00,441
pretty

32
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:01,402
Two

33
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:06,842
pretty

34
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:09,282
pretty

35
00:07:09,481 --> 00:07:10,441
Congratulations to the ten of you.

Will be held by the current number one King Sunqi.

00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,082
And the second place North Road.

42
00:07:21,082 --> 00:07:21,762

43
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:22,962

44
00:07:22,962 --> 00:07:24,241
The strongest player.

45
00:07:24,241 --> 00:07:25,882

Let's go.

47
00:07:27,241 --> 00:07:28,322
It's the last game tomorrow.

48
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,481
That's all you need to practice.

49
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:30,681
What's the use of improvising?

50
00:07:31,121 --> 00:07:32,082
I want to keep the feel.

51
00:07:32,322 --> 00:07:33,842
Can't you see that?

52
00:07:33,842 --> 00:07:34,962
Who can make the A team.

53
00:07:34,962 --> 00:07:36,041
Are supported.

54
00:07:36,642 --> 00:07:38,202
It's so transparent like us.

55
00:07:38,202 --> 00:07:39,121
You can only join the B team.

56
00:07:39,762 --> 00:07:40,481
You know,

57
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:41,801
What does King's father do?

58
00:07:41,842 --> 00:07:43,681
Is the boss of a listed company.

59
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:46,001
It's said that they have investment.

60
00:07:48,842 --> 00:07:50,001
No matter how good his father is,

61
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:51,642
I can't play for him.

62
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:54,481
King's current battle damage ratio

63
00:07:54,481 --> 00:07:55,202
And the record.

64
00:07:55,202 --> 00:07:56,041
Is the best.

65
00:07:56,082 --> 00:07:57,322
He doesn't have as many heads as I do.

66
00:07:57,801 --> 00:07:59,162
He's worse than me.

67
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:01,441
Because he hasn't met me yet.

68
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:14,202
Are you still practicing?

69
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:15,481
It's already two o'clock.

70
00:08:16,441 --> 00:08:17,801
Can you handle tomorrow's election?

71
00:08:18,162 --> 00:08:18,801
Let's go.

72
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:19,801
After this round,

73
00:08:19,962 --> 00:08:20,722
Alright.

74
00:08:20,722 --> 00:08:22,082
Turn off the computer when you leave.

75
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:24,041
Let's go.

76
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:24,921
good

77
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:25,762
This child

78
00:08:26,402 --> 00:08:27,921
I really want to play.

79
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:35,882
brother

80
00:08:36,602 --> 00:08:38,201
What is this game called?

81
00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:39,561
CrossFire

82
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:40,642
Cross Fire

83
00:08:40,961 --> 00:08:41,561
Xiaobei

84
00:08:41,561 --> 00:08:42,041
You want to play too?

85
00:10:20,522 --> 00:10:21,362
Xiao Feng, what are you doing?

86
00:10:21,362 --> 00:10:22,602
Why are you still here?

87
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,841
All the flowers I've been waiting for are gone.

88
00:10:25,162 --> 00:10:27,162
I didn't know there was a big fish today.

89
00:10:27,402 --> 00:10:28,482
Hurry up.

90
00:10:28,482 --> 00:10:29,961
Let the fish wait a little longer.

91
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:27,402
The bike

92
00:11:27,762 --> 00:11:29,282
What are you doing? Get out of the way.

93
00:11:31,642 --> 00:11:32,321
Beep him.

94
00:11:47,602 --> 00:11:48,041
Superhim.

95
00:12:01,242 --> 00:12:02,482
Cattle and bicycle.

96
00:12:02,482 --> 00:12:03,242
Go on.

97
00:12:03,242 --> 00:12:03,921
Superme.

98
00:12:47,721 --> 00:12:48,681
What's wrong with you?

99
00:12:49,721 --> 00:12:50,602
What are you doing

100
00:12:51,201 --> 00:12:52,242
Will you ride a bike?

101
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:54,041
Riding around on a broken bike.

102
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,242
Can you ride it?

103
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:56,201
to wait a moment

104
00:12:56,402 --> 00:12:57,681
We know each other.

105
00:12:57,681 --> 00:12:58,681
We know each other.

106
00:12:59,041 --> 00:12:59,681
You know her?

107
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:00,081
know

108
00:13:00,081 --> 00:13:00,681
It's okay.

109
00:13:00,801 --> 00:13:01,681
Get in the car.

110
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:02,961
Why are you here?

111
00:13:03,921 --> 00:13:05,482
Xiao Feng, why are you here?

112
00:13:05,522 --> 00:13:06,402
I was just passing by.

113
00:13:09,002 --> 00:13:09,882
Congratulations.

114
00:13:11,721 --> 00:13:12,721
I see.

115
00:13:13,362 --> 00:13:14,762
You were chasing the car so hard.

116
00:13:14,762 --> 00:13:16,002
To stop me from getting married.

117
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,801
Peaches, you got it wrong.

118
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:19,321
I didn't expect that

119
00:13:19,321 --> 00:13:20,602
We have been separated for so long.

120
00:13:20,602 --> 00:13:21,721
You still remember me.

121
00:13:24,362 --> 00:13:25,522
Heavens!

122
00:13:27,762 --> 00:13:30,561
Did you plan everything carefully?

123
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:32,762
Time and place.

124
00:13:33,362 --> 00:13:34,801
Everything is perfect.

125
00:13:35,002 --> 00:13:35,762
big sister

126
00:13:35,762 --> 00:13:36,921
You really think too much.

127
00:13:36,921 --> 00:13:38,242
I really didn't plan it.

128
00:13:38,242 --> 00:13:39,482
Stop talking nonsense.

129
00:13:39,482 --> 00:13:40,321
I know.

130
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:42,242
It's hard for me to marry you.

131
00:13:42,242 --> 00:13:43,081
It's very painful.

132
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,961
That's why you came to chase the car.

133
00:13:49,402 --> 00:13:50,882
Are you here to steal the wedding?

134
00:13:51,002 --> 00:13:51,282
big sister

135
00:13:51,282 --> 00:13:52,362
Look at me.

136
00:13:52,402 --> 00:13:53,482
Is it like a robbery?

137
00:13:53,522 --> 00:13:54,242
marriage by capture

138
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:55,961
Who wants to steal the wedding?

139
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:56,721
Xiao Feng, you...

140
00:13:56,721 --> 00:13:56,961
eldest brother

141
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:57,482
You want to steal the wedding?

142
00:13:57,482 --> 00:13:58,402
No

143
00:13:58,402 --> 00:13:58,882
It's not what you think.

144
00:13:58,961 --> 00:14:00,242
I'm not here to steal a wedding.

145
00:14:00,242 --> 00:14:00,841
No

146
00:14:01,122 --> 00:14:01,921
I'm really not stealing a wedding.

147
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:02,482
Untie me.

148
00:14:03,362 --> 00:14:04,681
Don't be a dog if you're not.

149
00:14:07,002 --> 00:14:08,242
Honey, I'm not talking about you.

150
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:10,162
Don't be like a dog.

151
00:14:10,201 --> 00:14:11,602
And follow me.

152
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:13,041
I didn't follow her.

153
00:14:13,122 --> 00:14:14,882
Do you know why Peaches dumped you?

154
00:14:14,882 --> 00:14:16,002
Do you have to marry me?

155
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,362
The reason is simple.

156
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,441
The money I earned from investing in stocks,

157
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:22,041
You can't earn a small amount in your lifetime.

158
00:14:22,282 --> 00:14:24,961
Besides playing games in internet cafes,

159
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:25,721
What else can you do?

160
00:14:28,882 --> 00:14:29,841
Why are you kicking my car?

161
00:14:34,921 --> 00:14:35,921
eldest brother

162
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:37,321
It's only a few hundred yuan.

163
00:14:37,321 --> 00:14:38,282
You can't use so much.

164
00:14:46,122 --> 00:14:47,642
Is that enough now?

165
00:14:48,642 --> 00:14:49,961
enough

166
00:14:51,002 --> 00:14:52,122
Get out of here.

167
00:14:52,122 --> 00:14:53,282
You ride your old car,

168
00:14:53,522 --> 00:14:54,921
As far as I can.

169
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:56,321
Come here.

170
00:14:57,122 --> 00:14:58,522
Calm down.

171
00:14:59,642 --> 00:15:01,122
Why are you angry? Look.

172
00:15:01,362 --> 00:15:02,841
The collar is messed up.

173
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:03,721
And flowers.

174
00:15:04,402 --> 00:15:05,282
Let's smoke.

175
00:15:05,602 --> 00:15:07,921
Calm down.

176
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:10,081
It's such a good atmosphere.

177
00:15:11,482 --> 00:15:12,122
right or wrong?

178
00:15:13,801 --> 00:15:14,362
Come here.

179
00:15:17,122 --> 00:15:17,921
What are you doing?

180
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:18,762
To get married or not?

181
00:15:19,162 --> 00:15:20,961
junction

182
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:21,841
Smile.

183
00:15:23,762 --> 00:15:24,721
Let's go.

184
00:15:27,002 --> 00:15:27,841
He's good.

185
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:46,801
Xiao Feng.

186
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:50,122
I didn't expect you to be so infatuated with me.

187
00:15:50,762 --> 00:15:52,041
No matter what you say today,

188
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:52,642
what are you doing?

189
00:15:52,642 --> 00:15:53,681
I won't make up with you.

190
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:55,561
I got married to let you know

191
00:15:55,561 --> 00:15:57,201
There is no regret medicine in the world.

192
00:15:57,921 --> 00:15:59,602
I really regret it now.

193
00:15:59,602 --> 00:16:00,961
You should check the royal calendar before going out.

194
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,961
Stop it. Don't say anything useless.

195
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:03,882
Leave now.

196
00:16:04,002 --> 00:16:05,681
Don't fool around from now on.

197
00:16:05,681 --> 00:16:06,602
Look at yourself.

198
00:16:06,602 --> 00:16:08,642
Can you get a real job?

199
00:16:08,681 --> 00:16:10,522
Haven't you seen the news recently?

200
00:16:10,681 --> 00:16:12,522
Video games are a potential stock now.

201
00:16:12,522 --> 00:16:14,081
You might become a regular career.

202
00:16:14,081 --> 00:16:14,841
Your income is high.

203
00:16:14,882 --> 00:16:15,561
What's more,

204
00:16:15,602 --> 00:16:16,841
I'm not fooling around.

205
00:16:16,841 --> 00:16:17,762
I stick to my dream.

206
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:19,002
Stop it.

207
00:16:19,002 --> 00:16:20,122
Why aren't you in heaven?

208
00:16:20,282 --> 00:16:21,602
Why don't you become an astronaut?

209
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:22,321
Be derelict in duty and run irrelevant business

210
00:16:22,321 --> 00:16:23,561
How dare you?

211
00:16:23,801 --> 00:16:25,642
It's hopeless to save you.

212
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:27,882
I don't care about anything without medicine.

213
00:16:27,882 --> 00:16:28,961
Time will prove everything.

214
00:16:30,642 --> 00:16:32,362
Yes, time can prove it.

215
00:16:32,362 --> 00:16:33,441
I broke up with you.

216
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:35,081
How right he is.

217
00:17:02,281 --> 00:17:04,201
Today is the last day of the training camp.

218
00:17:04,201 --> 00:17:05,281
Is the final decision.

219
00:17:05,562 --> 00:17:07,122
Everyone must play well.

220
00:17:07,241 --> 00:17:08,921
Show your true level.

221
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:10,882
Now, I will explain the procedure of the competition.

222
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,322
Team A choose the map first.

223
00:17:14,842 --> 00:17:16,082
Why did Team A choose first?

224
00:17:17,562 --> 00:17:18,842
Let me emphasize the discipline.

225
00:17:18,961 --> 00:17:20,921
The trainee must obey the club's arrangement.

226
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:22,362
Play games.

227
00:17:22,961 --> 00:17:24,001
You must know the rules of the game.

228
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:26,122
Next, Team A chooses the map.

229
00:17:26,122 --> 00:17:27,481
We've discussed it.

230
00:17:27,521 --> 00:17:28,481
Choose the submarine.

231
00:17:37,961 --> 00:17:39,162
Choose the black town.

232
00:17:43,842 --> 00:17:44,441
good

233
00:17:44,842 --> 00:17:45,842
The black town.

234
00:18:01,241 --> 00:18:02,042
Door B is off.

235
00:18:02,042 --> 00:18:03,921
good

236
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:10,602
There's only one King left.

237
00:18:17,241 --> 00:18:18,521
good

238
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:24,842
Lu Xiao Bei,

239
00:18:24,842 --> 00:18:26,761
You stabbed King.

240
00:18:27,681 --> 00:18:29,201
This is too crazy.

241
00:18:33,921 --> 00:18:34,362
Lu Xiao Bei,

242
00:18:35,241 --> 00:18:36,322
Captain Liang wants you there.

243
00:18:36,802 --> 00:18:37,802
Lu Xiao Bei,

244
00:18:38,082 --> 00:18:39,281
You're still too young.

245
00:18:39,521 --> 00:18:41,842
A lot of things will end well if you don't work hard.

246
00:18:41,842 --> 00:18:43,681
You should learn to see the situation.

247
00:18:43,681 --> 00:18:45,082
Why are you A and B?

248
00:18:45,322 --> 00:18:46,481
Don't you understand?

249
00:18:46,721 --> 00:18:48,481
Team B must lose to team A.

250
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:49,681
Right?

251
00:18:49,681 --> 00:18:50,761
I'll give you a thorough explanation.

252
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:51,882
Club to sign King

253
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:53,362
This has been decided long ago.

254
00:18:53,562 --> 00:18:54,921
Then why did you play this match?

255
00:18:55,042 --> 00:18:56,521
We have to go through the motions.

256
00:18:56,642 --> 00:18:58,602
I can ask President Xu to sign you as a substitute.

257
00:18:58,802 --> 00:18:59,961
But the premise is that

258
00:19:00,042 --> 00:19:01,802
Don't bother me in the next round.

259
00:19:02,201 --> 00:19:03,122
Understand?

260
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:06,642
Got it.

261
00:19:11,281 --> 00:19:12,562
Why is the leader looking for you?

262
00:19:13,281 --> 00:19:14,241
Good thing

263
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:15,721
The leader told me

264
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:17,842
As long as I lose the game,

265
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:19,521
You can sign me as a substitute.

266
00:19:19,882 --> 00:19:21,322
But when we come here,

267
00:19:21,481 --> 00:19:22,961
Just to be a substitute?

268
00:19:23,481 --> 00:19:24,882
You play games to win.

269
00:19:25,642 --> 00:19:26,721
I don't want to lose.

270
00:19:27,602 --> 00:19:28,761
We won't lose.

271
00:20:11,122 --> 00:20:12,162
There's one in the middle door.

272
00:20:14,441 --> 00:20:15,602
good

273
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:28,042
A, the top two.

274
00:20:30,281 --> 00:20:30,802
The middle door is off.

275
00:20:30,882 --> 00:20:31,802
Cover me.

276
00:20:40,961 --> 00:20:41,721
Strike while the iron is hot.

277
00:20:41,842 --> 00:20:43,441
You cover me. I'm going to An Bao.

278
00:21:22,602 --> 00:21:23,642
What happened

279
00:21:24,642 --> 00:21:25,402
It's King.

280
00:21:25,921 --> 00:21:27,122
Where is King?

281
00:21:27,921 --> 00:21:28,721
Behind the high box,

282
00:21:31,642 --> 00:21:32,761
There are 30 seconds left.

283
00:21:32,761 --> 00:21:33,562
How to do it?

284
00:21:33,562 --> 00:21:34,642
Why don't we go out together?

285
00:21:35,402 --> 00:21:37,162
Don't put your eggs in one basket.

286
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,322
I'll send the heads.

287
00:21:38,322 --> 00:21:38,842
The rest

288
00:21:39,162 --> 00:21:40,201
I'll leave it to you.

289
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:42,322
What if I'm nervous?

290
00:21:44,201 --> 00:21:46,082
That means you're a loser.

291
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:48,362
Throw the gun away.

292
00:21:48,921 --> 00:21:49,842
Admit defeat.

293
00:22:02,761 --> 00:22:03,721
Xiangzi.

294
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:16,441
good

295
00:22:17,761 --> 00:22:19,042
pretty

296
00:22:32,562 --> 00:22:33,481
how could that be?

297
00:22:34,241 --> 00:22:35,201
I'm sorry. It's my problem.

298
00:22:35,402 --> 00:22:36,602
Don't say sorry.

299
00:22:36,602 --> 00:22:38,281
Tell me the solution.

300
00:22:40,642 --> 00:22:42,761
The training camp has the best record.

301
00:22:42,842 --> 00:22:44,882
King's battle damage ratio is still the highest.

302
00:22:45,162 --> 00:22:46,562
Lu Xiao Bei is behind him.

303
00:22:46,921 --> 00:22:49,362
Did you see the comments on the live platform?

304
00:22:49,921 --> 00:22:51,882
Many people are supporting Lu Bei.

305
00:22:52,402 --> 00:22:54,362
Why don't you sign a substitute agreement with him?

306
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:55,961
After a while,

307
00:22:55,961 --> 00:22:57,362
Find a way to kick him out.

308
00:22:57,681 --> 00:22:58,761
honestly speaking

309
00:22:59,481 --> 00:23:00,721
He has great potential.

310
00:23:00,961 --> 00:23:02,562
Anyone can sign it.

311
00:23:02,842 --> 00:23:05,001
You can't sign the contract, Lu Bei.

312
00:23:21,961 --> 00:23:23,082
Brothers,

313
00:23:23,082 --> 00:23:24,961
This game is crucial for us.

314
00:23:25,201 --> 00:23:26,241
You should cheer up later.

315
00:23:26,521 --> 00:23:27,441
What's the point?

316
00:23:28,042 --> 00:23:29,602
I've asked about the fat geese inside.

317
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:30,961
You are silly and have a lot of money.

318
00:23:30,961 --> 00:23:32,562
We must win this battle.

319
00:23:32,562 --> 00:23:33,362
One, two.

320
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:34,681
One or two

321
00:23:35,761 --> 00:23:36,882
You must.

322
00:23:37,721 --> 00:23:38,562
What do you mean?

323
00:23:38,562 --> 00:23:39,441
You don't have to.

324
00:23:39,681 --> 00:23:40,721
Cut my hair.

325
00:23:40,721 --> 00:23:41,642
I was so angry.

326
00:23:41,761 --> 00:23:42,721
Xu Wei.

327
00:23:42,961 --> 00:23:44,042
My hair is in your way.

328
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:44,721
Obstruction

329
00:23:44,802 --> 00:23:45,481
Bear it.

330
00:23:45,481 --> 00:23:46,521
I can't bear it. What are you staring at?

331
00:23:46,521 --> 00:23:47,362
What are you doing?

332
00:23:47,362 --> 00:23:48,122
Brother Kirin.

333
00:23:48,122 --> 00:23:48,562
I'm looking at you.

334
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:49,441
I saw what happened.

335
00:23:49,642 --> 00:23:50,802
Captain, Brother Kirin.

336
00:23:50,921 --> 00:23:53,001
Isn't there a hair salon in the back?

337
00:23:53,082 --> 00:23:53,802
and

338
00:23:53,802 --> 00:23:55,802
The little sister inside is so enthusiastic.

339
00:23:58,681 --> 00:23:59,082
every time

340
00:23:59,441 --> 00:24:00,721
When you pass by, say hello.

341
00:24:00,961 --> 00:24:02,201
It'll take a while.

342
00:24:02,201 --> 00:24:03,362
Let's cut your hair together.

343
00:24:04,201 --> 00:24:05,281
You are so talkative.

344
00:24:05,602 --> 00:24:06,521
Am I blind?

345
00:24:06,721 --> 00:24:08,362
I can't tell this is a hair salon.

346
00:24:14,681 --> 00:24:16,521
Stop bullying Ming.

347
00:24:16,602 --> 00:24:17,521
He's so small.

348
00:24:17,802 --> 00:24:19,842
Are you rich?

349
00:24:19,842 --> 00:24:21,082
What do you want?

350
00:24:22,322 --> 00:24:23,602
I have no money.

351
00:24:24,042 --> 00:24:25,362
Everyone has confidence.

352
00:24:25,362 --> 00:24:26,042
Don't be discouraged.

353
00:24:26,082 --> 00:24:26,842
As long as you play well,

354
00:24:26,842 --> 00:24:27,562
The money will be there.

355
00:24:27,562 --> 00:24:28,642
His wife will be married.

356
00:24:28,721 --> 00:24:30,201
You can buy whatever you want.

357
00:24:30,481 --> 00:24:31,882
How long do you like your hair?

358
00:24:31,882 --> 00:24:32,521
Nobody cares about you.

359
00:24:32,602 --> 00:24:33,402
That's enough.

360
00:24:33,402 --> 00:24:34,362
You've been talking about it for years.

361
00:24:34,521 --> 00:24:36,001
I'm asking you. You're playing games.

362
00:24:36,001 --> 00:24:37,281
You have bought a house now.

363
00:24:37,562 --> 00:24:38,602
You're still married.

364
00:24:39,001 --> 00:24:40,281
Let's not talk about this.

365
00:24:40,281 --> 00:24:41,761
The unhappy topic.

366
00:24:42,521 --> 00:24:44,162
Xiao Feng is still coming.

367
00:24:44,521 --> 00:24:46,241
I'll call Xiao Feng later.

368
00:24:49,802 --> 00:24:50,961
He's here.

369
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,042
Are they here?

370
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:54,001
Why are you so late?

371
00:24:54,322 --> 00:24:55,362
I'm telling you,

372
00:24:55,362 --> 00:24:56,562
Be smart later.

373
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:57,642
The purpose of our vote

374
00:24:57,642 --> 00:24:59,481
So that I can earn the money for the night sex.

375
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:29,241
For so long.

376
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:30,642
It turned out to be a group of uncles.

377
00:25:30,681 --> 00:25:32,201
You must be over 100 years old together.

378
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:32,802
Stop playing.

379
00:25:32,802 --> 00:25:34,201
Go back and change the diaper.

380
00:25:34,281 --> 00:25:35,842
We are a little old.

381
00:25:36,082 --> 00:25:37,602
Then treat us like old people.

382
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:38,082
Let's

383
00:25:38,761 --> 00:25:40,281
Let's go. We won't bully him.

384
00:25:40,481 --> 00:25:42,721
You must be older than us.

385
00:25:42,802 --> 00:25:43,921
I'm only 18.

386
00:25:44,402 --> 00:25:44,761
eighteen

387
00:25:45,082 --> 00:25:46,082
This is boring.

388
00:25:46,082 --> 00:25:47,362
Whoever loses will have supper.

389
00:25:47,362 --> 00:25:48,281
What about

390
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:52,162
As long as you win,

391
00:25:52,162 --> 00:25:52,802
Make yourself at home.

392
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:54,001
It's done.

393
00:25:54,001 --> 00:25:54,761
Pick a map.

394
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:56,241
Transport ship snatches people's heads.

395
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:57,921
transport ship

396
00:25:58,562 --> 00:26:00,201
We are not familiar with this picture.

397
00:26:00,281 --> 00:26:01,441
You can still fight.

398
00:26:02,481 --> 00:26:03,642
A transport ship.

399
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:24,362
They doubt their lives.

400
00:26:35,521 --> 00:26:36,201
Xu Wei, follow me.

401
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:37,042
Received

402
00:26:40,122 --> 00:26:40,882
Cover for Xiao Feng.

403
00:26:54,402 --> 00:26:55,402
The Kirin Firepower Lure

404
00:26:55,721 --> 00:26:56,402
good

405
00:27:09,602 --> 00:27:10,681
The Kirin Armin sealed the road.

406
00:27:10,961 --> 00:27:11,921
Look at the top.

407
00:27:17,322 --> 00:27:18,082
Lieutenant

408
00:27:18,082 --> 00:27:18,322
on

409
00:27:23,362 --> 00:27:24,642
Monkey, kill quickly on the flank.

410
00:27:24,961 --> 00:27:25,362
good

411
00:27:45,681 --> 00:27:46,961
Captain, close the net.

412
00:28:18,961 --> 00:28:19,882
Your team

413
00:28:19,882 --> 00:28:20,921
What is it called?

414
00:28:21,281 --> 00:28:22,322
The Coin Team.

415
00:28:22,322 --> 00:28:23,122
Never heard of it?

416
00:28:23,362 --> 00:28:24,241
Never heard of it?

417
00:28:24,322 --> 00:28:25,882
It's a coin team.

418
00:28:26,001 --> 00:28:27,162
I've never heard of it.

419
00:28:27,481 --> 00:28:28,441
That's why you're in this circle.

420
00:28:28,441 --> 00:28:29,681
The time is too short.

421
00:28:29,681 --> 00:28:32,042
We're the runner-up of the provincial Internet cafe competition.

422
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:32,681
Never heard of it.

423
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:36,681
Brother

424
00:28:36,721 --> 00:28:37,721
Give it another shot.

425
00:28:37,721 --> 00:28:38,842
What are you doing?

426
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,042
I've been babysitting all afternoon.

427
00:28:42,042 --> 00:28:42,721
you bet, you pay

428
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,481
It's scattered.

429
00:29:02,642 --> 00:29:03,441
Come on, let's go.

430
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:05,882
Another free barbecue.

431
00:29:05,882 --> 00:29:06,241
Unicorn

432
00:29:11,921 --> 00:29:13,082
Come and eat.

433
00:29:13,721 --> 00:29:14,042
Cheers!

434
00:29:14,042 --> 00:29:14,842
You go ahead

435
00:29:18,961 --> 00:29:20,001
I have good news.

436
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:22,602
Crossing the Line of Fire is about to hold the national challenge.

437
00:29:22,882 --> 00:29:24,162
The winner's bonus is tens of thousands of yuan.

438
00:29:24,642 --> 00:29:26,082
I've signed up for our team.

439
00:29:26,481 --> 00:29:27,322
It's a good thing.

440
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:28,602
Cheers.

441
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:30,122
come

442
00:29:31,842 --> 00:29:32,441
Unicorn

443
00:29:36,402 --> 00:29:37,681
What's wrong?

444
00:29:38,521 --> 00:29:39,961
All of them looked downcast.

445
00:29:40,921 --> 00:29:41,562
monkey

446
00:29:41,882 --> 00:29:42,882
What happened

447
00:29:44,042 --> 00:29:44,761
we

448
00:29:44,961 --> 00:29:46,241
I don't want to play anymore.

449
00:29:47,521 --> 00:29:49,721
We're playing the Ningjiang District Division Match.

450
00:29:49,961 --> 00:29:51,521
Those online don't have to travel far.

451
00:29:51,642 --> 00:29:53,281
We mean that in the future,

452
00:29:53,481 --> 00:29:54,362
Don't waste time.

453
00:29:54,362 --> 00:29:55,281
Tell me straight.

454
00:29:56,362 --> 00:29:57,122
We don't want to play anymore.

455
00:30:04,322 --> 00:30:05,802
Are you going to break up again?

456
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:10,082
Let me say something.

457
00:30:10,082 --> 00:30:11,162
Look at our table.

458
00:30:11,402 --> 00:30:12,961
The youngest Ming.

459
00:30:13,281 --> 00:30:14,281
And 22.

460
00:30:14,842 --> 00:30:16,162
We can't go on like this.

461
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:18,721
Go back to me.

462
00:30:19,281 --> 00:30:20,402
I just got a job.

463
00:30:20,761 --> 00:30:22,122
Fishing for three days and sunning the net for two days.

464
00:30:22,241 --> 00:30:23,241
You don't even know that the leader is looking for me.

465
00:30:23,241 --> 00:30:25,082
What's wrong?

466
00:30:25,082 --> 00:30:25,802
When you were in trouble,

467
00:30:25,802 --> 00:30:27,001
Didn't Xiao Feng help you?

468
00:30:27,001 --> 00:30:27,642
All right, Captain.

469
00:30:28,322 --> 00:30:29,761
Your family kicked you out.

470
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:30,362
to be difficult with sb

471
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:31,402
Live here with Xiao Feng.

472
00:30:31,681 --> 00:30:34,162
Xiao Feng has been working on the floor for half a month.

473
00:30:34,162 --> 00:30:35,521
Don't you remember?

474
00:30:35,521 --> 00:30:36,562
And you, Kirin.

475
00:30:36,921 --> 00:30:38,402
When you were fighting in the Internet café,

476
00:30:38,562 --> 00:30:40,082
Xiao Feng took four or five blows for you.

477
00:30:40,481 --> 00:30:42,042
Xiao Feng carried you to the hospital.

478
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:43,001
I wrapped it for you first.

479
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:44,201
He didn't even care about himself.

480
00:30:45,162 --> 00:30:46,082
you

481
00:30:46,322 --> 00:30:47,441
I ate more than anyone.

482
00:30:47,441 --> 00:30:48,481
You are covered with clothes and pants.

483
00:30:48,481 --> 00:30:49,882
Which one is not Xiao Feng's?

484
00:30:50,042 --> 00:30:51,322
Why are you all looking at me?

485
00:30:51,322 --> 00:30:52,441
You said it's over.

486
00:30:52,521 --> 00:30:53,802
Have you got a conscience?

487
00:30:53,961 --> 00:30:54,681
What are you talking about?

488
00:30:54,681 --> 00:30:55,681
What's wrong?

489
00:30:55,761 --> 00:30:56,642
What are you doing?

490
00:30:56,642 --> 00:30:57,322
All right, Captain.

491
00:30:57,562 --> 00:30:58,322
calm

492
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:02,602
Let me ask you something.

493
00:31:03,122 --> 00:31:05,281
Yao Ming can stand in the NBA.

494
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:06,362
What is it?

495
00:31:06,562 --> 00:31:07,842
The height of 2.26 meters

496
00:31:08,082 --> 00:31:09,162
wrong

497
00:31:09,162 --> 00:31:10,761
The NBA has no shortage of tall men.

498
00:31:11,241 --> 00:31:11,842
Good technology.

499
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:14,001
Technically, that's a European player.

500
00:31:14,562 --> 00:31:15,961
Then why?

501
00:31:16,281 --> 00:31:17,441
Yao Ming can stand on his feet.

502
00:31:17,481 --> 00:31:18,842
It depends on two characters.

503
00:31:18,842 --> 00:31:19,721
to stand firm

504
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,322
Holding on means everything.

505
00:31:21,481 --> 00:31:23,362
It's no big deal for us to encounter such difficulties.

506
00:31:23,521 --> 00:31:24,521
When you bite and close your teeth,

507
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:25,441
You'll be fine.

508
00:31:26,122 --> 00:31:27,322
Think about what happened

509
00:31:27,362 --> 00:31:28,802
The champion is soft.

510
00:31:28,802 --> 00:31:30,162
As long as we join the competition,

511
00:31:30,162 --> 00:31:31,241
The other teams can only compete for the second place.

512
00:31:31,402 --> 00:31:31,921
right or wrong?

513
00:31:32,122 --> 00:31:33,201
How dare you say that?

514
00:31:33,322 --> 00:31:34,602
What kind of a game are they?

515
00:31:34,761 --> 00:31:36,122
The champion gave me a broken mouse pad.

516
00:31:36,681 --> 00:31:37,681
What's wrong with the mouse pad?

517
00:31:38,122 --> 00:31:39,481
The mouse pad is also an honor.

518
00:31:39,642 --> 00:31:40,681
What's wrong with the mouse pad?

519
00:31:40,681 --> 00:31:41,322
It stinks.

520
00:31:41,322 --> 00:31:42,562
Do you have a mouse pad?

521
00:31:42,761 --> 00:31:43,642
What happened to me?

522
00:31:43,681 --> 00:31:44,322
Your fighting stinks.

523
00:31:44,322 --> 00:31:45,162
You're amazing, right?

524
00:31:45,201 --> 00:31:46,241
I'm better than you.

525
00:31:46,802 --> 00:31:47,842
Go to the internet café first.

526
00:31:47,921 --> 00:31:49,122
How old are the children playing there?

527
00:31:49,322 --> 00:31:50,481
A child of 18 or 19 years old.

528
00:31:50,521 --> 00:31:51,521
Hurry up. Hurry.

529
00:31:51,521 --> 00:31:52,802
It's no big deal to stay up for a few days.

530
00:31:52,802 --> 00:31:53,362
Try it.

531
00:31:53,362 --> 00:31:54,241
What? Are you disabled?

532
00:31:54,241 --> 00:31:54,921
Don't you know how to practice?

533
00:31:55,001 --> 00:31:55,721
How old are you?

534
00:31:55,721 --> 00:31:56,642
How old are you? Can't you practice?

535
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:57,802
Stop it.

536
00:31:58,241 --> 00:31:59,802
We are a little old now.

537
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:01,481
But we have experience now.

538
00:32:01,721 --> 00:32:04,122
That's something that those little kids can't compete with.

539
00:32:04,441 --> 00:32:06,521
We didn't catch up well before.

540
00:32:06,642 --> 00:32:08,521
But crossing the fire is getting more and more popular.

541
00:32:08,602 --> 00:32:09,602
And got good grades.

542
00:32:09,642 --> 00:32:10,602
To get the sponsorship.

543
00:32:10,602 --> 00:32:12,322
You can sign a club and get a salary.

544
00:32:12,402 --> 00:32:13,681
Stop dreaming.

545
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:15,362
You need money to compete.

546
00:32:15,481 --> 00:32:16,681
You need money to eat and drink.

547
00:32:16,681 --> 00:32:17,521
We have no money now.

548
00:32:17,521 --> 00:32:18,082
Where did the money come from?

549
00:32:18,082 --> 00:32:19,441
Don't worry about the money.

550
00:32:19,802 --> 00:32:20,681
I'll think of a way.

551
00:32:21,201 --> 00:32:23,281
We should hold on for a while.

552
00:32:23,281 --> 00:32:24,362
At least come back with a champion.

553
00:32:24,362 --> 00:32:26,042
There's only one champion.

554
00:32:26,082 --> 00:32:27,201
It's not that easy.

555
00:32:27,201 --> 00:32:28,162
Besides,

556
00:32:28,441 --> 00:32:29,602
Even if he wins the championship,

557
00:32:29,602 --> 00:32:30,562
So what?

558
00:32:30,562 --> 00:32:32,802
Are you eating or drinking?

559
00:32:33,082 --> 00:32:35,241
Brothers, if you continue to muddle along,

560
00:32:35,241 --> 00:32:36,842
It's pure northwest wind.

561
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:55,721
a row

562
00:32:57,721 --> 00:32:58,681
Old rules

563
00:32:59,281 --> 00:33:00,042
Let's listen to it.

564
00:33:02,082 --> 00:33:04,402
Three times, facing up,

565
00:33:04,562 --> 00:33:05,842
No one is allowed to leave.

566
00:33:06,162 --> 00:33:07,241
a row

567
00:33:08,882 --> 00:33:09,842
Don't throw it away.

568
00:33:10,082 --> 00:33:11,961
Why should I listen to the money?

569
00:33:13,162 --> 00:33:14,082
Come back.

570
00:33:14,082 --> 00:33:15,162
What's wrong with you?

571
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:16,921
Your girlfriend ran away with someone.

572
00:33:16,921 --> 00:33:18,602
Are you still listening to the coins?

573
00:33:18,642 --> 00:33:19,481
Why are you mentioning my girlfriend?

574
00:33:19,481 --> 00:33:20,521
What about your girlfriend?

575
00:33:20,642 --> 00:33:21,802
You can't mention my girlfriend.

576
00:33:21,802 --> 00:33:22,802
What?

577
00:33:22,802 --> 00:33:23,322
Try it again.

578
00:33:23,322 --> 00:33:23,921
I'll mention it.

579
00:33:23,921 --> 00:33:24,761
You mentioned your girlfriend.

580
00:33:50,162 --> 00:33:50,882
Where have you been?

581
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,042
I'm going to the bathroom.

582
00:33:54,322 --> 00:33:56,001
Did you check the live platform?

583
00:33:56,761 --> 00:33:58,042
I have the votes now.

584
00:33:58,042 --> 00:33:59,082
More than King.

585
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,122
You're third.

586
00:34:03,761 --> 00:34:04,681
Everyone has been waiting for a long time.

587
00:34:04,802 --> 00:34:07,122
I now announce the final result of the election.

588
00:34:07,361 --> 00:34:09,122
Who decided to sign the contract?

589
00:34:09,801 --> 00:34:11,082
King, Sunchi.

590
00:34:11,761 --> 00:34:13,082
Congratulations to Sun Qi.

591
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:16,401
In addition

592
00:34:16,642 --> 00:34:17,761
After the initial investigation,

593
00:34:17,962 --> 00:34:19,482
Trainee, North Road.

594
00:34:19,881 --> 00:34:22,482
Cheating and breaking the rules in the competition.

595
00:34:22,482 --> 00:34:24,761
Caused a very bad influence.

596
00:34:24,761 --> 00:34:26,401
Cancel the selection result.

597
00:34:26,841 --> 00:34:27,642
feed

598
00:34:28,082 --> 00:34:29,962
Give me such a huge scapegoat.

599
00:34:29,962 --> 00:34:31,082
At least we should have some evidence.

600
00:34:31,201 --> 00:34:32,201
The club never

601
00:34:32,201 --> 00:34:33,321
For no reason.

602
00:34:33,962 --> 00:34:35,201
What did you do?

603
00:34:35,201 --> 00:34:36,042
I know.

604
00:34:36,042 --> 00:34:37,562
I know better than anyone.

605
00:34:37,562 --> 00:34:38,642
I didn't cheat.

606
00:34:38,922 --> 00:34:39,721
Really?

607
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:41,162
Li Jiaxiang

608
00:34:41,962 --> 00:34:44,122
Tell me what you just told the club.

609
00:34:44,602 --> 00:34:46,761
Let me repeat it here.

610
00:34:47,401 --> 00:34:48,442
it doesn't matter

611
00:34:48,442 --> 00:34:50,962
The club needs people who dare to tell the truth.

612
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:54,082
I can prove it.

613
00:34:54,562 --> 00:34:57,162
I heard Lu Xiao Bei discuss with him before the game.

614
00:34:57,442 --> 00:34:58,442
When you compete,

615
00:34:58,881 --> 00:34:59,881
I admit that

616
00:35:00,442 --> 00:35:01,801
He asked me to do this.

617
00:35:02,122 --> 00:35:02,841
Lu Xiao Bei,

618
00:35:03,002 --> 00:35:04,522
What do you have to explain?

619
00:35:05,321 --> 00:35:07,162
The alliance has made repeated demands.

620
00:35:07,162 --> 00:35:08,442
How dare you act against the wind?

621
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:09,681
I'm telling you,

622
00:35:09,681 --> 00:35:11,442
There are 16 teams in the league.

623
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,962
No one will sign you.

624
00:35:13,401 --> 00:35:14,841
You can't be a professional.

625
00:35:15,602 --> 00:35:16,681
Don't even think about it.

626
00:35:31,361 --> 00:35:32,482
Xiaobei

627
00:35:34,642 --> 00:35:35,761
Xiaobei

628
00:35:36,562 --> 00:35:37,642
sorry

629
00:35:37,642 --> 00:35:38,761
Please don't.

630
00:35:39,201 --> 00:35:41,401
Just now, I thought you were a little bad.

631
00:35:43,321 --> 00:35:44,721
Xiaobei

632
00:35:44,721 --> 00:35:45,361
Here's the thing.

633
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:46,681
Xiaobei

634
00:35:48,602 --> 00:35:49,522
They forced me.

635
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,841
Stop making excuses.

636
00:35:51,801 --> 00:35:53,681
You just want me to forgive you.

637
00:35:53,681 --> 00:35:55,482
Then you can forgive yourself.

638
00:35:55,482 --> 00:35:56,562
The next time,

639
00:35:56,562 --> 00:35:57,562
You would still do that.

640
00:35:57,801 --> 00:35:58,761
Do you think

641
00:35:58,761 --> 00:35:59,801
As long as you find a reason,

642
00:36:00,361 --> 00:36:01,721
You will be forgiven.

643
00:36:01,841 --> 00:36:02,881
Sorry

644
00:36:03,482 --> 00:36:04,642
I hold a grudge.

645
00:36:05,602 --> 00:36:06,562
This matter

646
00:36:07,122 --> 00:36:08,841
I will never forgive you.

647
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:11,681
I don't want to see you anymore.

648
00:36:12,401 --> 00:36:13,321
Get out of here.

649
00:36:30,482 --> 00:36:32,321
The alliance has made repeated demands.

650
00:36:32,321 --> 00:36:33,602
How dare you act against the wind?

651
00:36:33,602 --> 00:36:34,881
I'm telling you,

652
00:36:34,881 --> 00:36:36,602
There are 16 teams in the league.

653
00:36:36,602 --> 00:36:38,321
No one will sign you.

654
00:36:38,562 --> 00:36:40,002
You can't be a professional.

655
00:36:40,761 --> 00:36:42,042
Don't even think about it.

656
00:36:47,482 --> 00:36:48,442
Police officer.

657
00:36:48,721 --> 00:36:49,841
Who are you?

658
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:52,042
I'm looking for Lu Xiaobai.

659
00:36:52,602 --> 00:36:53,681
Don't bother.

660
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,122
Let's go.

661
00:38:43,761 --> 00:38:44,801
Xiaobei

662
00:38:44,801 --> 00:38:45,881
The clothes are ready for you.

663
00:38:45,881 --> 00:38:46,922
Come and take a shower.

664
00:39:10,122 --> 00:39:10,962
What's wrong, Xiao Bei?

665
00:39:16,522 --> 00:39:17,122
Don't help.

666
00:39:27,042 --> 00:39:28,162
This is not good.

667
00:39:29,361 --> 00:39:30,361
I don't need your help.

668
00:39:32,881 --> 00:39:34,241
You don't have to wash it yourself.

669
00:39:35,681 --> 00:39:36,681
I'll wash it myself.

670
00:39:37,562 --> 00:39:38,602
Wash yourself.

671
00:39:56,002 --> 00:39:57,042
Dr. Li asked you to check.

672
00:39:57,442 --> 00:39:58,321
Why aren't you going?

673
00:39:58,642 --> 00:39:59,681
What are you going to do?

674
00:40:00,002 --> 00:40:01,122
My legs won't recover.

675
00:40:01,562 --> 00:40:02,361
I don't want to.

676
00:40:10,361 --> 00:40:12,361
But if you want to give me back my computer,

677
00:40:12,801 --> 00:40:13,922
I can think about it.

678
00:40:15,002 --> 00:40:16,522
What are you thinking?

679
00:40:16,841 --> 00:40:18,082
School starts tomorrow.

680
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,082
You're a senior.

681
00:40:20,162 --> 00:40:21,082
It's time to take it easy.

682
00:40:21,761 --> 00:40:23,321
You have to make up for all the lessons you missed.

683
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:24,482
I'm telling you,

684
00:40:24,482 --> 00:40:26,681
There's no way to play games.

685
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,681
I'll choose the path I want to take.

686
00:40:29,082 --> 00:40:30,401
I'll be responsible for the somersault.

687
00:40:30,721 --> 00:40:31,922
Have you thought about it?

688
00:40:32,201 --> 00:40:33,841
The society is so competitive now.

689
00:40:34,361 --> 00:40:35,482
If you don't study hard,

690
00:40:35,522 --> 00:40:36,401
If you don't get into a good university,

691
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:37,201
future

692
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:39,442
What will you do in the future?

693
00:40:41,201 --> 00:40:42,201
My dream job

694
00:40:42,201 --> 00:40:43,522
Is an e-sports player.

695
00:40:43,922 --> 00:40:44,801
Why should I apply for the university?

696
00:40:44,801 --> 00:40:46,042
To steal the single-plank bridge from others.

697
00:40:47,522 --> 00:40:49,281
There's no special access for the disabled on the bridge.

698
00:40:51,321 --> 00:40:52,002
Boy

699
00:40:52,002 --> 00:40:52,881
Listen carefully.

700
00:40:53,281 --> 00:40:54,442
From now on,

701
00:40:55,042 --> 00:40:56,602
I can't handle all the first-line cases.

702
00:40:56,602 --> 00:40:57,642
I'm watching you.

703
00:40:58,361 --> 00:40:59,361
Don't bother.

704
00:40:59,761 --> 00:41:01,361
Just lock me up in the detention center.

705
00:41:01,562 --> 00:41:02,401
Take care of yourself.

706
00:41:02,401 --> 00:41:03,602
Save time and effort.

707
00:41:04,681 --> 00:41:05,761
Naughty boy.

708
00:41:08,122 --> 00:41:09,162
Do you think I want to manage you?

709
00:41:09,162 --> 00:41:10,401
Stay out of it.

710
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:28,281
What's wrong with you two?

711
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:31,482
The toilet seat is broken.

712
00:41:45,241 --> 00:41:46,841
I didn't choose the training camp.

713
00:41:47,962 --> 00:41:49,801
They signed a guy named King.

714
00:41:51,361 --> 00:41:52,562
I'm no worse than him.

715
00:41:55,241 --> 00:41:56,841
I've been waiting for this chance for a long time.

716
00:41:57,881 --> 00:41:58,962
But in the end,

717
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,482
They want me to lose.

718
00:42:01,922 --> 00:42:02,841
I can't.

719
00:42:05,321 --> 00:42:07,002
Then the club didn't sign me.

720
00:42:07,522 --> 00:42:08,962
And framed me for cheating.

721
00:42:11,002 --> 00:42:12,962
Maybe they only like people who listen.

722
00:42:13,442 --> 00:42:14,361
You know that.

723
00:42:15,922 --> 00:42:16,801
I'm not.

724
00:42:18,162 --> 00:42:19,562
Never.

725
00:42:20,082 --> 00:42:22,401
There won't be a team willing to sign me now.

726
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,201
What should I do?

727
00:42:27,642 --> 00:42:28,962
Can you tell me?

728
00:42:30,522 --> 00:42:31,401
Brother

729
00:42:48,241 --> 00:42:49,361
Can't you knock?

730
00:42:52,482 --> 00:42:53,482
Go to bed early.

731
00:42:54,281 --> 00:42:55,042
Tomorrow morning,

732
00:42:55,042 --> 00:42:56,241
To take you to school.

733
00:42:58,162 --> 00:42:59,401
About the game,

734
00:42:59,401 --> 00:43:00,361
Don't think about it anymore.

735
00:44:44,002 --> 00:44:44,642
Full name

736
00:44:44,642 --> 00:44:45,162
age

737
00:44:45,162 --> 00:44:46,002
occupation

738
00:44:46,042 --> 00:44:46,881
Huo Qilian.

739
00:44:47,721 --> 00:44:48,442
Twenty

740
00:44:48,562 --> 00:44:49,482
And sold seafood.

741
00:44:49,681 --> 00:44:50,721
As a webmaster.

742
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:51,562
Now?

743
00:44:51,962 --> 00:44:52,602
No job.

744
00:44:52,841 --> 00:44:54,082
My name is Xu Wei.

745
00:44:54,082 --> 00:44:55,522
24 years ago,

746
00:44:55,522 --> 00:44:57,082
I haven't decided on a career.

747
00:44:57,122 --> 00:44:58,562
My name is Hou Zhihao.

748
00:44:58,562 --> 00:45:00,002
I'm 23 years old.

749
00:45:00,002 --> 00:45:00,801
I haven't asked you yet.

750
00:45:02,801 --> 00:45:03,522
Sit down

751
00:45:04,922 --> 00:45:05,281
Full name

752
00:45:05,281 --> 00:45:05,602
age

753
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:06,241
occupation

754
00:45:07,522 --> 00:45:08,442
My name is...

755
00:45:08,721 --> 00:45:10,042
Huang Deming

756
00:45:10,042 --> 00:45:10,922
We'll be there soon.

757
00:45:10,922 --> 00:45:11,841
Speak nicely.

758
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:12,801
What's wrong with you?

759
00:45:12,801 --> 00:45:14,681
I'm about to...

760
00:45:14,721 --> 00:45:15,681
And went to college.

761
00:45:16,962 --> 00:45:17,841
Close the team.

762
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:18,681
What a coincidence.

763
00:45:19,082 --> 00:45:19,681
I always come here.

764
00:45:19,681 --> 00:45:20,642
We used to see each other.

765
00:45:20,642 --> 00:45:21,241
We are really fated.

766
00:45:21,241 --> 00:45:22,241
Sit down

767
00:45:23,042 --> 00:45:23,442
Full name

768
00:45:23,442 --> 00:45:23,761
age

769
00:45:23,761 --> 00:45:24,361
occupation

770
00:45:24,522 --> 00:45:25,241
Xiao Feng.

771
00:45:25,241 --> 00:45:26,241
25 years old.

772
00:45:26,241 --> 00:45:26,962
Professional team.

773
00:45:27,201 --> 00:45:29,281
Do you know why I brought you here?

774
00:45:29,281 --> 00:45:29,841
know

775
00:45:29,922 --> 00:45:32,401
A few good friends, have some wine.

776
00:45:32,401 --> 00:45:34,082
You drank too much.

777
00:45:34,082 --> 00:45:36,122
We didn't make it clear.

778
00:45:36,162 --> 00:45:37,522
And had a little fight.

779
00:45:37,642 --> 00:45:38,761
And started to push.

780
00:45:40,442 --> 00:45:41,241
Waist pain.

781
00:45:42,482 --> 00:45:43,841
Tell me the details.

782
00:45:43,922 --> 00:45:44,721
For example,

783
00:45:44,721 --> 00:45:45,881
I'm going to take the blitz.

784
00:45:45,881 --> 00:45:47,042
The captain is holding an AK-47.

785
00:45:47,162 --> 00:45:47,922
what

786
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:48,922
You still have guns?

787
00:45:49,361 --> 00:45:50,162
You got it wrong.

788
00:45:50,241 --> 00:45:51,761
We are game props.

789
00:45:51,801 --> 00:45:53,162
It's all my fault.

790
00:45:53,162 --> 00:45:54,522
It has nothing to do with Xiao Feng.

791
00:45:54,522 --> 00:45:55,681
What's your relationship with him?

792
00:45:55,841 --> 00:45:56,841
We are brothers.

793
00:45:57,042 --> 00:45:58,321
It's really nothing.

794
00:45:58,442 --> 00:45:59,761
Nothing has happened yet.

795
00:45:59,761 --> 00:46:01,201
You're shaking the bottle.

796
00:46:01,201 --> 00:46:03,042
I missed the bottle.

797
00:46:03,281 --> 00:46:04,562
It's none of my business. Actually,

798
00:46:04,841 --> 00:46:06,122
I don't know anything.

799
00:46:06,162 --> 00:46:08,401
I was just watching.

800
00:46:08,642 --> 00:46:10,201
Nothing. Why are your legs shaking?

801
00:46:10,241 --> 00:46:11,602
Sorry, officer.

802
00:46:11,881 --> 00:46:12,761
I know I was wrong.

803
00:46:12,761 --> 00:46:13,522
Sit down.

804
00:46:14,122 --> 00:46:15,721
I know I was wrong.

805
00:46:16,241 --> 00:46:17,042
Professional team.

806
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:18,201
Team.

807
00:46:18,482 --> 00:46:20,241
Is the same as the basketball team.

808
00:46:20,241 --> 00:46:21,761
The five of us have different roles

809
00:46:21,761 --> 00:46:22,761
To form a small group.

810
00:46:22,922 --> 00:46:23,721
I'll call you a team.

811
00:46:23,962 --> 00:46:26,122
It's just a group game.

812
00:46:27,162 --> 00:46:28,962
It's different from playing games.

813
00:46:29,162 --> 00:46:30,602
We are professionals.

814
00:46:30,602 --> 00:46:31,602
We are professional teams.

815
00:46:31,602 --> 00:46:33,761
Don't put those words on your face.

816
00:46:33,761 --> 00:46:35,361
After all, it's one thing.

817
00:46:35,522 --> 00:46:36,522
I'm telling you,

818
00:46:36,522 --> 00:46:37,881
The boss is not young anymore.

819
00:46:38,321 --> 00:46:39,361
Get down to business.

820
00:46:39,442 --> 00:46:41,522
Don't play games in internet cafes all day long.

821
00:46:41,522 --> 00:46:42,881
What can he achieve?

822
00:47:03,602 --> 00:47:04,241
Brother Feng,

823
00:47:04,241 --> 00:47:05,721
Why don't we go to the game hall?

824
00:47:05,841 --> 00:47:06,841
Let's buy another one.

825
00:47:06,841 --> 00:47:07,962
Are the same coin?

826
00:47:07,962 --> 00:47:08,721
No way

827
00:47:08,721 --> 00:47:09,841
This is different.

828
00:47:17,681 --> 00:47:18,401
Lieutenant

829
00:47:18,962 --> 00:47:19,401
Come here.

830
00:47:34,801 --> 00:47:36,361
Almost.

831
00:47:37,442 --> 00:47:38,801
right

832
00:47:39,241 --> 00:47:40,002
good

833
00:47:41,361 --> 00:47:42,201
I got it.

834
00:48:56,241 --> 00:48:58,881
The three of them are determined to break up.

835
00:48:59,321 --> 00:49:01,602
What should we do next?

836
00:49:01,881 --> 00:49:03,922
A three-legged toad is hard to find.

837
00:49:04,642 --> 00:49:06,401
There are plenty of two-legged people.

838
00:49:07,042 --> 00:49:08,922
The Earth will still turn without anyone.

839
00:49:12,002 --> 00:49:13,642
No matter what happens,

840
00:49:14,082 --> 00:49:15,721
Just stay together.

841
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:27,241
I haven't paid for my living expenses yet.

842
00:49:28,042 --> 00:49:29,401
Yesterday, I added a tank of oil.

843
00:49:30,162 --> 00:49:31,562
There's only so much left.

844
00:49:46,681 --> 00:49:47,922
Only 500 yuan.

845
00:49:48,281 --> 00:49:50,321
You can't even pay the rent.

846
00:49:52,082 --> 00:49:53,922
I'll get some help.

847
00:49:55,721 --> 00:49:57,281
Are we still practicing?

848
00:50:00,962 --> 00:50:02,281
Save some power.

849
00:50:02,281 --> 00:50:02,962
Sleep

850
00:50:56,162 --> 00:50:57,082
Try again.

851
00:50:58,241 --> 00:50:59,162
I lost.

852
00:50:59,881 --> 00:51:01,162
You will give up completely.

853
00:51:45,321 --> 00:51:47,002
In the transport ship competition mode,

854
00:51:47,002 --> 00:51:48,442
Kill the highest number of players.

855
00:51:48,442 --> 00:51:50,042
Will be the number one.

856
00:51:50,042 --> 00:51:51,642
The golden ACE title.

857
00:56:58,801 --> 00:56:59,922
strange

858
00:56:59,922 --> 00:57:01,162
Where is it?

859
00:57:06,162 --> 00:57:07,122
Who is it?

860
00:57:07,442 --> 00:57:08,642
Who's talking?

861
00:57:17,562 --> 00:57:18,602
Who are you?

862
00:57:20,042 --> 00:57:21,201
Who are you?

863
00:57:22,962 --> 00:57:24,922
You must be the lurker.

864
00:57:26,082 --> 00:57:27,721
Is the screen dark?

865
00:57:28,681 --> 00:57:29,241
How do you know?

866
00:57:29,482 --> 00:57:30,281
Mine too.

867
00:57:30,562 --> 00:57:31,761
You can't get out.

868
00:57:32,681 --> 00:57:34,082
Then why are we still talking to each other?

869
00:57:34,962 --> 00:57:36,002
is or isn't

870
00:57:36,681 --> 00:57:38,082
There must be some loophole.

871
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:39,681
Turn it off and restart.

872
00:57:39,801 --> 00:57:40,562
No more.

873
00:57:40,562 --> 00:57:41,562
Just pull the power.

874
00:57:42,321 --> 00:57:43,162
feed

875
00:57:43,162 --> 00:57:43,922
Are you still there

876
00:57:44,042 --> 00:57:45,281
Did you restart it?

877
00:57:45,281 --> 00:57:46,681
Restarted it, but it's useless.

878
00:57:46,681 --> 00:57:47,401
Or the black screen?

879
00:57:47,602 --> 00:57:49,281
We're fated to be together.

880
00:57:50,122 --> 00:57:51,201
What's your name?

881
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:52,681
What's your name?

882
00:57:52,801 --> 00:57:54,241
You don't know.

883
00:57:54,241 --> 00:57:55,281
Then why are you asking me?

884
00:57:55,401 --> 00:57:57,881
I don't want to ask if you have a team.

885
00:57:57,881 --> 00:57:59,482
I think you're good at this.

886
00:57:59,761 --> 00:58:00,642
You're alright.

887
00:58:01,241 --> 00:58:02,201
No team.

888
00:58:02,482 --> 00:58:03,602
Where is your home?

889
00:58:04,042 --> 00:58:04,841
From Ningjiang.

890
00:58:05,042 --> 00:58:06,042
What a coincidence!

891
00:58:06,201 --> 00:58:07,522
I'm also from Ning Jiang.

892
00:58:08,042 --> 00:58:08,881
What's your name?

893
00:58:08,962 --> 00:58:10,681
It's only a small place like Ning Jiang.

894
00:58:10,761 --> 00:58:12,721
You must have a mutual friend.

895
00:58:12,721 --> 00:58:13,801
My name is Lu Xiao Bei.

896
00:58:14,002 --> 00:58:15,002
The north of the north.

897
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,321
My name is Xiao Feng.

898
00:58:16,482 --> 00:58:17,562
Maple leaves.

899
00:58:18,801 --> 00:58:19,681
Dude,

900
00:58:20,241 --> 00:58:21,642
Can we stop talking nonsense?

901
00:58:21,881 --> 00:58:22,721
What's up

902
00:58:22,922 --> 00:58:24,442
There is a Xiao Feng in Ningjiang.

903
00:58:24,681 --> 00:58:25,761
GameID

904
00:58:25,761 --> 00:58:26,482
Called Seven.

905
00:58:26,881 --> 00:58:28,401
You even know my game ID.

906
00:58:28,401 --> 00:58:29,082
Who doesn't know?

907
00:58:29,321 --> 00:58:30,642
The name Xiao Feng

908
00:58:30,681 --> 00:58:31,841
In our Ningjiang e-sports circle,

909
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,042
Is a myth.

910
00:58:33,522 --> 00:58:34,321
The first time to cross the fire line,

911
00:58:34,321 --> 00:58:36,002
National Challenge Champion.

912
00:58:36,281 --> 00:58:37,801
He was also the King of Golden Spear that year.

913
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:39,401
Many classic tactics.

914
00:58:39,401 --> 00:58:40,841
Was written by him.

915
00:58:41,241 --> 00:58:42,162
People give nicknames.

916
00:58:42,281 --> 00:58:43,482
Crossing the line of fire.

917
00:58:43,482 --> 00:58:45,321
Humanoid tactics textbook.

918
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:46,122
Dude,

919
00:58:46,162 --> 00:58:48,082
You can pretend to be Great Immortal next time.

920
00:58:48,082 --> 00:58:49,281
Pick one that's almost there.

921
00:58:49,522 --> 00:58:51,721
Don't pick yourself up to the sky.

922
00:58:53,042 --> 00:58:53,881
Dude,

923
00:58:54,922 --> 00:58:56,002
I'm so promising.

924
00:58:56,002 --> 00:58:57,922
Why don't I know?

925
00:58:58,122 --> 00:59:00,482
I haven't signed up for the National Challenge.

926
00:59:00,482 --> 00:59:02,002
Where can I get the championship?

927
00:59:02,241 --> 00:59:03,361
Stop acting.

928
00:59:03,681 --> 00:59:04,721
I have committed embarrassing cancer.

929
00:59:05,602 --> 00:59:06,841
a row

930
00:59:06,841 --> 00:59:07,602
How about this?

931
00:59:07,721 --> 00:59:08,881
Then tell me about it.

932
00:59:08,881 --> 00:59:09,841
I'm

933
00:59:09,881 --> 00:59:10,602
No

934
00:59:10,602 --> 00:59:11,681
Xiao Feng

935
00:59:11,721 --> 00:59:12,522
How did he take that?

936
00:59:12,522 --> 00:59:14,122
The winner of the National Challenge.

937
00:59:14,401 --> 00:59:16,082
The sports news of those two years

938
00:59:16,082 --> 00:59:17,401
I only remember two things.

939
00:59:17,801 --> 00:59:18,522
one

940
00:59:19,042 --> 00:59:20,201
Xiao Feng's team

941
00:59:20,201 --> 00:59:21,881
And won the National Challenge.

942
00:59:22,002 --> 00:59:22,881
two

943
00:59:22,881 --> 00:59:24,321
Liu Xiang Olympics

944
00:59:24,321 --> 00:59:26,482
The 110m hurdles preliminary is dismissed.

945
00:59:26,482 --> 00:59:27,321
What is that?

946
00:59:27,562 --> 00:59:29,122
Liu Xiang withdrew.

947
00:59:29,721 --> 00:59:31,361
The 110m hurdles hasn't started yet.

948
00:59:31,361 --> 00:59:32,482
What kind of competition?

949
00:59:32,681 --> 00:59:34,042
Don't be ridiculous, bro.

950
00:59:34,482 --> 00:59:35,681
Liu Xiang withdrew from the Olympics.

951
00:59:35,681 --> 00:59:37,082
It's been 11 years.

952
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:41,002
Liu Xiang has participated in 48 world events.

953
00:59:41,642 --> 00:59:42,962
Won the championship 36 times.

954
00:59:43,281 --> 00:59:44,162
And we

955
00:59:44,162 --> 00:59:45,761
All I remember is that he withdrew.

956
00:59:45,761 --> 00:59:46,602
Dude,

957
00:59:46,922 --> 00:59:48,522
We're almost there.

958
00:59:48,841 --> 00:59:50,321
Don't be too dramatic.

959
00:59:50,321 --> 00:59:51,122
Look now.

960
00:59:51,241 --> 00:59:53,162
What year is it today?

961
00:59:55,562 --> 00:59:58,082
Saturday, August 17, 2009

962
00:59:58,482 --> 00:59:59,442
Is there a problem?

963
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:00,721
Of course there's a problem.

964
01:00:00,721 --> 01:00:01,962
It's a big problem.

965
01:00:01,962 --> 01:00:02,922
There's something wrong with the computer.

966
01:00:02,922 --> 01:00:04,401
It's because you're crazy.

967
01:00:04,401 --> 01:00:05,922
Go to the hospital.

968
01:00:06,122 --> 01:00:07,562
To visit you in the hospital.

969
01:00:08,642 --> 01:00:09,962
Brother Liar,

970
01:00:10,522 --> 01:00:12,642
I can't understand what you're talking about.

971
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:13,241
today

972
01:00:13,241 --> 01:00:15,881
It's August 17, 2008.

973
01:00:16,442 --> 01:00:17,482
You know,

974
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:20,042
Your side.

975
01:00:20,042 --> 01:00:21,922
It's 2008.

976
01:00:22,442 --> 01:00:23,442
That's right.

977
01:00:41,681 --> 01:00:42,602
Dude,

978
01:00:53,002 --> 01:00:55,162
In 2019,
