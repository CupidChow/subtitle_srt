1
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:30,429
Happy birthday to you

2
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:33,909
Happy birthday to you

3
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:41,989
This is for you.

4
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,150
Thank you, brother.

5
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:46,669
Do you like it

6
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:48,070
This is the bracelet I made for you.

7
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,029
like

8
00:02:49,029 --> 00:02:50,989
I like them all.

9
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:52,150
What does that mean?

10
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:53,670
This is going on.

11
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,269
This is an English word.

12
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,110
To continue.

13
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:57,229
I'll bring it for you.

14
00:02:57,629 --> 00:02:58,430
Do you remember?

15
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,229
video game

16
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:00,549
And the arcade machines in the game hall.

17
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,629
Every time you missed the game,

18
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:04,390
The screen will show this word.

19
00:03:04,589 --> 00:03:05,670
As long as you are willing,

20
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,990
You can continue to fight.

21
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:08,229
I think

22
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,909
The most attractive part of the game

23
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:11,150
It's okay to fail.

24
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,629
Let's fight again.

25
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:13,629
You'll be able to pass it sooner or later.

26
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:14,189
right or wrong?

27
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:15,790
Look.

28
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:17,750
Has gone on.

29
00:03:23,309 --> 00:03:23,829
son

30
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:24,589
You're back.

31
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,589
Come here.

32
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:28,029
Dad is away on a business trip.

33
00:03:28,029 --> 00:03:29,350
It's your birthday.

34
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:31,150
That's it.

35
00:03:31,309 --> 00:03:32,469
We're lighting a candle now.

36
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:40,869
Make a wish.

37
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:00,150
Hello, King.

38
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,910
Congratulations on winning the best player again.

39
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,270
Thank you

40
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,990
The latest season of Crossfire Pro League

41
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,910
The war is coming.

42
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,630
Do you think that

43
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,029
What will be the biggest difficulty?

44
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,589
I haven't found it yet.

45
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,550
There are many people in the league now.

46
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,389
To challenge you.

47
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:13,949
Do you have anything to say to them?

48
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,229
Line up.

49
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:17,949
One by one.

50
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:23,509
This is not good.

51
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:24,790
There are 21 days left.

52
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,830
Are you going to fight or not?

53
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,029
I'm leaving now.

54
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:28,670
I've found her.

55
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:30,469
who

56
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:33,230
Nezha, protection deity

57
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:34,349
Do you know him?

58
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,789
I know Nezha.

59
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:37,629
His eldest brother Jinzha and his second brother Muzha

60
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:39,230
Father or King Tota Li?

61
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,469
Lu Xiao Bei, can you rely on music score?

62
00:04:41,469 --> 00:04:42,749
It seems I have to go.

63
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:44,990
One of Ning Jiang's famous teams counts.

64
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,029
I've never heard of him.

65
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:47,430
He's low-key.

66
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,749
I've never been on a team before.

67
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,950
Then where did you get it?

68
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:51,950
forum

69
00:04:52,869 --> 00:04:54,069
He's definitely an AK master.

70
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:55,789
You're a master, but you are still in the forum.

71
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,629
The hero doesn't ask the origin.

72
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,430
We have to figure out what he is.

73
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,230
If something goes wrong, it will be bad.

74
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:04,909
He is special.

75
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,510
Different from the others.

76
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,670
Do you know him?

77
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:08,710
I don't know.

78
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,629
But I know where to find him.

79
00:05:11,469 --> 00:05:12,589
The person you're looking for

80
00:05:12,869 --> 00:05:14,349
I'm still curious.

81
00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:18,150
What if she's a pretty little sister,

82
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:19,510
I can tell you,

83
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:19,909
Let's go.

84
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:20,349
I'll pack up the luggage.

85
00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:20,710
Set out

86
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,390
Go now.

87
00:05:21,869 --> 00:05:22,629
I'll leave after I finish packing.

88
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:23,430
Wait for me.

89
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,230
No one will stop me today.

90
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,189
Can't Su Jiayi really leave?

91
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:31,349
What's up

92
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:32,230
You don't want to give up.

93
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:33,830
I'm looking for you.

94
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,749
to feel relieved

95
00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:36,510
There's food, drink and shelter.

96
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,990
There's someone else.

97
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,990
Not only won't she leave,

98
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,950
And catch up with him.

99
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:45,230
What are you looking at?

100
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,670
You're the only ones who pick on people.

101
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,670
Without my help,

102
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,189
What if you pick out the crooked melon and the cracked dates?

103
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:51,270
go

104
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:57,309
Guess which one is Nezha.

105
00:05:58,309 --> 00:05:59,510
This Tony in white and glasses

106
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:00,869
No

107
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:02,589
That's the one in front of me.

108
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:03,710
The handsome Tony.

109
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,749
Not really.

110
00:06:04,749 --> 00:06:07,029
Not that pouting Tony.

111
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:08,069
I stand on my head and drink soda.

112
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:09,069
I told you.

113
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,469
He is

114
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:11,589
Different from the others.

115
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:12,830
Which one is it?

116
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,909
I don't care about anything.

117
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:20,029
He didn't wash his head or sweep the floor.

118
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:20,749
You won't say anything.

119
00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:21,390
Seriously?

120
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:23,430
You got it wrong.

121
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,189
He was scolded like a third grandson.

122
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:26,629
Don't waste my time.

123
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:27,990
I wouldn't be with such a common person.

124
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,670
As a teammate.

125
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,550
Will lose the powder.

126
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,629
Alright.

127
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,430
It's not a beauty contest.

128
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:33,469
You said that?

129
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:35,909
You're so stupid.

130
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,390
We're the same.

131
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:38,630
Each has its own tricks.

132
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:39,909
Stop picking.

133
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:41,789
Hello

134
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:43,870
Haircut or styling?

135
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,989
I want to wash my hair.

136
00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:46,190
Find him.

137
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,150
It's not enough to be scolded by me every day.

138
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:47,870
Golden-haired Tony.

139
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:48,909
Can you do it?

140
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,349
You can't do it. Leave now.

141
00:06:50,549 --> 00:06:52,469
How many times have I told you?

142
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,229
First card, haircut, second.

143
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,870
Why do you keep this stinky hair for me?

144
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,469
Cut off your chicken coop.

145
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:00,710
How many customers did you scare away?

146
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,429
What are you waiting for?

147
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,549
Wash your hair.

148
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:07,070
Sir, do you have a card?

149
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,229
Now it's 2,000 for 600 for 5,000 for 2,000.

150
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,630
You can get a discount.

151
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,710
Right

152
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:29,549
Someone is coming.

153
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,070
Seal the smoke.

154
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,870
Sure.

155
00:07:39,109 --> 00:07:39,950
You have a good sense.

156
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,190
you

157
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:43,909
It's Nezha.

158
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:45,830
My name is Lu Xiao Bei.

159
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:47,549
I heard you're good at AK.

160
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,950
So I came to see you.

161
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,750
What about

162
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,630
Are you interested?

163
00:07:51,109 --> 00:07:52,150
Form a team with us.

164
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:52,909
To attack Hundred Cities.

165
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:53,429
No

166
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:55,150
Don't rush to refuse.

167
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:56,989
See those people over there?

168
00:07:56,989 --> 00:07:59,270
The best guns in Ning River are all here.

169
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,989
Are you interested?

170
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:01,710
no

171
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,270
We are serious.

172
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,669
It's not just for fun.

173
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,750
Don't you want to be a professional e-sports player?

174
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:09,989
think

175
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,349
Why are you talking?

176
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,950
It's the same as AK shooting.

177
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,429
One word at a time.

178
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:16,469
I really want to be a professional.

179
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,669
Just follow me.

180
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:19,549
Don't waste your ability.

181
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,789
Is it difficult?

182
00:08:21,549 --> 00:08:23,310
You want to wash someone's hair here forever.

183
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:29,830
Then you...

184
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:31,549
To come to my team?

185
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,469
money

186
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,750
20 hours later,

187
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,229
It's much higher than you washing their hair here.

188
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,390
You can play games.

189
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,270
Don't be scolded.

190
00:08:47,349 --> 00:08:48,349
How's it going, Xiao Bei?

191
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:50,789
20 an hour.

192
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:51,549
It's done.

193
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,029
You must have taken the wrong medicine.

194
00:08:53,229 --> 00:08:54,469
This kind of weirdo.

195
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,870
We should be happy.

196
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:56,830
we

197
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,070
Picked up a big treasure.

198
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,989
Mad

199
00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:01,070
I've never heard of charging for forming a team.

200
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,150
Money can solve nothing.

201
00:09:03,469 --> 00:09:04,070
That's fine.

202
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,630
Take care of me.

203
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,349
I'm not expensive.

204
00:09:06,349 --> 00:09:07,070
200 per hour.

205
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:07,989
It's 20% off.

206
00:09:09,109 --> 00:09:09,750
Xiaobei

207
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,589
There's a thousand-year-old woman in our team.

208
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:14,070
And a late stage of the second disease.

209
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,630
Has suffered enough.

210
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,789
I beg you to stop bringing trouble to the team.

211
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:20,630
Alright?

212
00:09:20,989 --> 00:09:21,789
Besides,

213
00:09:22,989 --> 00:09:24,150
Where did you get the money?

214
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:25,469
I didn't.

215
00:09:25,989 --> 00:09:26,830
You have it.

216
00:09:27,989 --> 00:09:29,710
Brother, don't step on me.

217
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,270
I can't live anymore.

218
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,669
Anyway, I'm telling you the ugly story.

219
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:34,310
If it doesn't work,

220
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,789
I'll kick him out first.

221
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,830
Lu Xiao Bei,

222
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,109
I think

223
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:39,830
You have a special taste in selecting people.

224
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:41,549
It's so special.

225
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:42,510
yes

226
00:09:42,989 --> 00:09:43,870
otherwise

227
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,150
How can we be together?

228
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:53,909
The Imperial Clay Mask

229
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:55,310
Whitening and hydrating.

230
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,830
Gently press the mask for 15 to 20 minutes.

231
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:53,789
feed

232
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:54,390
What's up

233
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,350
Why are you so quiet?

234
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:55,949
Come back.

235
00:10:55,949 --> 00:10:57,510
There was a man knocking at the door.

236
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,390
Knock? Who is it?

237
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,949
I don't know who it is. Come back.

238
00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:00,150
How to do it?

239
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,429
Hang up. I'll be home soon.

240
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:02,230
feed

241
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:54,189
Why are you here?

242
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,829
You did it on purpose.

243
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,390
Don't worry.

244
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:09,230
The main component of the insecticide

245
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,750
It's pyrethrin and cypermethrin.

246
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:13,110
Will not cause great harm to the human body.

247
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,990
Who is she?

248
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:20,630
I'm Xiao Feng's junior high schoolmate.

249
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,909
They are living together now.

250
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,750
That's my room.

251
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,110
Is your brain still hurting?

252
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,590
Portulaca Sundial

253
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:31,350
I left my ID card here.

254
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:32,990
Give it to me.

255
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,069
ID

256
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,029
You want to sign up for the competition?

257
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,069
What's up

258
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,470
Envious, jealous and hateful

259
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:40,150
Do whatever you want.

260
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,990
What does it have to do with me?

261
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:42,669
Then give me your ID.

262
00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:43,829
Which team are you going to?

263
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,230
I thought you didn't care.

264
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:48,510
I'm just curious.

265
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:50,590
Which team didn't take you in?

266
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:53,669
Dynasty Team.

267
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:56,709
You're angry.

268
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,390
Don't flatter yourself.

269
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,350
You're not my wife.

270
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,189
Where are you going? Follow me.

271
00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:02,390
It doesn't matter at all.

272
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,510
Why are you staring at me?

273
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,590
I didn't stare at you.

274
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,870
Because the team lost to them.

275
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,150
that's right

276
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:12,350
They are my teammates now.

277
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,549
Give me your ID.

278
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,750
I have to congratulate you.

279
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:23,630
You finally found a team that played obscenely.

280
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:24,750
In the future,

281
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,909
Thank you

282
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:28,350
As long as I can win,

283
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,590
The style is not important.

284
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,390
I didn't ask you to eat here.

285
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:35,949
Leave now.

286
00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:38,189
I didn't want to eat it.

287
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,789
Then leave.

288
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:40,870
I was just leaving.

289
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,029
Then why are you still here?

290
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:42,789
I'm leaving.

291
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:43,990
Bye

292
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:45,350
not see

293
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,069
Move out of my way

294
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,590
There are three kinds of cigarettes.

295
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,270
Especially dangerous chemicals.

296
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,189
Tar, nicotine, and carbon dioxide

297
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:13,309
And the nicotine is absorbed by the lungs.

298
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:15,390
It acts on the nervous system and is addictive.

299
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,189
The carbon dioxide will dissolve the low red blood cells.

300
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,069
To the whole body.

301
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,230
You should know that

302
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,230
Who smoke twenty cigarettes a day.

303
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,870
Is more likely to die from cancer than

304
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,270
Who don't smoke.

305
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,829
You two had a fight.

306
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,750
No

307
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,829
We're fine.

308
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:36,709
It's great.

309
00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:39,510
You know when people are angry,

310
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,829
Secreting a kind of enzyme called serotonin hydroxylase.

311
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:44,230
You have CH all over your body.

312
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,390
Why am I angry?

313
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:46,309
I'm not angry.

314
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:49,150
There are three words written on your face.

315
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,949
Unhappy

316
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:51,029
Did I?

317
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:51,990
I'm so happy now.

318
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,949
Very happy.

319
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,709
Do what you like with the person you like.

320
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:55,590
Will be happy.

321
00:14:55,949 --> 00:14:56,990
You don't even know me.

322
00:14:57,309 --> 00:14:58,870
I don't know what I want to do.

323
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,230
In fact, you've always known

324
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,029
I just don't want to admit it.

325
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,029
Fifteen.

326
00:15:32,189 --> 00:15:35,069
You've made great progress in the Chinese exam this time.

327
00:15:35,429 --> 00:15:37,230
It seems you two are helping each other.

328
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,309
The effect is remarkable.

329
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,110
Lu Xiao Bei, how about the exam?

330
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:41,429
You care so much about him.

331
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:42,189
No

332
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:43,909
I'm just asking.

333
00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:49,110
One hundred and five.

334
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,150
He has a good foundation.

335
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,990
And smart.

336
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,709
If you don't want to play games all the time,

337
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:54,909
The progress should be faster.

338
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:56,630
There's no problem to get a first-class undergraduate.

339
00:15:56,829 --> 00:15:57,750
clever

340
00:15:58,669 --> 00:16:00,069
I think he is not clever at all.

341
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:01,630
You can't get a bachelor's degree.

342
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,470
Play games.

343
00:16:02,909 --> 00:16:04,189
You're his deskmate.

344
00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:05,590
Can push him.

345
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:17,549
You want to go to the internet café again?

346
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:22,990
I don't understand

347
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,270
Why are you talking to

348
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,270
The people in society

349
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,429
And play games together.

350
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,750
You don't understand.

351
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,829
Playing games and e-sports are two different things.

352
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,549
What's the difference?

353
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,630
Most ordinary players play games.

354
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,510
Just to enjoy the game.

355
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,270
The happiness of the game.

356
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,590
And we...

357
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:41,709
With e-sports career dreams.

358
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:44,029
Is capable of living on e-sports.

359
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:45,829
In short

360
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,429
Is also running.

361
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,549
you

362
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,990
And the old man running in the morning.

363
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:51,870
Can you stop making excuses?

364
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,029
These are two different things.

365
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:54,150
This is the same thing.

366
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,590
You have the time to care about me.

367
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,669
Read more books.

368
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,029
Have you finished the simulation?

369
00:16:58,029 --> 00:16:59,029
Have you finished learning the words?

370
00:16:59,029 --> 00:16:59,789
Have you finished your homework?

371
00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:00,669
What's wrong with you?

372
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:04,590
The family is against the teachers.

373
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,230
You have so many ways to prove yourself.

374
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,270
Why did you choose the most annoying one?

375
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:09,829
I'm not a couch.

376
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:12,029
I have no obligation to make everyone comfortable.

377
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:14,750
If Miss Bai asks,

378
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,709
I will tell her the truth.

379
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:16,429
Alright.

380
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:17,709
Then you can add one to your strengths.

381
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:18,470
Mind your own business.

382
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:37,510
I won't argue with you this time.

383
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,029
Keep it a secret from me.

384
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,990
Hello, everyone.

385
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,069
Welcome to Jiayi's studio.

386
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,309
today

387
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:15,909
"Jinx" means "Jin X."

388
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:17,789
Our theme is waiting.

389
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,510
Waiting for our captain, Lu Xiabei.

390
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,230
Wang Kai, say hello.

391
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,830
Our captain is very late.

392
00:19:25,709 --> 00:19:26,669
You're finally here.

393
00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:27,550
Sorry I'm late.

394
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,189
fast

395
00:19:28,189 --> 00:19:28,469
It's here.

396
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,070
Nezha, protection deity

397
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:36,350
It's on.

398
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,269
Let's go to Room Two of Five Frequency.

399
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,870
Look at him.

400
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,790
How do you play it if the keyboard is upright?

401
00:19:59,509 --> 00:20:00,350
Today is the first day.

402
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,590
Let's get to know each other.

403
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,030
Nezha and S + 1 are guarding A.

404
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,469
Wang Kai and Cheng Hao, follow me B

405
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:05,590
Let's play a steady game.

406
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,429
Are you clear?

407
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:06,989
Received

408
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:07,429
Set out

409
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:08,070
go

410
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,189
I was flashed.

411
00:20:22,189 --> 00:20:23,189
The five of them are charging for A.

412
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,189
Nezha's replacement.

413
00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:24,870
Oh

414
00:20:25,189 --> 00:20:26,150
Cheng Hao, Wang Kai, back up.

415
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,110
Received

416
00:20:57,469 --> 00:20:58,509
It's Nezha.

417
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,590
We are the champions.

418
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:10,550
Nezha, protection deity

419
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,989
From now on, I'll take you live.

420
00:21:11,989 --> 00:21:13,310
To make sure that the gift will explode.

421
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,590
More than your current hourly rate.

422
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,550
This is our first time to play.

423
00:21:16,749 --> 00:21:17,550
You have such tacit understanding.

424
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,590
And won the battle.

425
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:19,429
Just right

426
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,469
On this day,

427
00:21:20,469 --> 00:21:21,550
Let's choose a name.

428
00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:22,949
Xiao Bei, you're the captain.

429
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:23,790
It's your choice.

430
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:27,229
Actually,

431
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:28,830
I've thought about it.

432
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:30,709
I'll call you

433
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,550
Go on.

434
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,870
Continue

435
00:21:34,189 --> 00:21:35,030
What do you mean?

436
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,070
Continue

437
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:38,709
When I was young, I played arcade games.

438
00:21:39,189 --> 00:21:40,949
This word appears at the end of every game.

439
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:42,590
Continue

440
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:50,429
I think so.

441
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:51,749
Cut and kick.

442
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,509
Cut him, kick him and twist him.

443
00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:54,310
He's very aggressive.

444
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:55,429
I agree.

445
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:56,989
What do you think

446
00:21:57,269 --> 00:21:57,949
ChengHao

447
00:21:58,429 --> 00:21:59,390
Of course I can.

448
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:00,870
Nezha, protection deity

449
00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:05,189
good

450
00:22:05,989 --> 00:22:06,870
Then today,

451
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,310
Let's continue our team.

452
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,509
It was officially established.

453
00:22:09,989 --> 00:22:10,830
Strike while the iron is hot

454
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,469
Let's try again.

455
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,229
good

456
00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:17,790
Uncle, you're here.

457
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:20,229
go

458
00:22:20,229 --> 00:22:20,870
Go home.

459
00:22:22,189 --> 00:22:23,669
It's school time now.

460
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,150
I'm not a criminal.

461
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,229
I repeat, go home.

462
00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:29,310
Uncle, here's the thing.

463
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,429
There are fewer people today.

464
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,229
You had to drag Xiao Bei in.

465
00:22:32,229 --> 00:22:33,269
He didn't want to come.

466
00:22:35,509 --> 00:22:36,630
Don't block him.

467
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,749
I know what he thinks.

468
00:22:39,229 --> 00:22:39,989
Where is the bag?

469
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,909
This is his father who is a police officer.

470
00:22:58,189 --> 00:22:58,870
Well

471
00:22:59,749 --> 00:23:00,509
Is that necessary?

472
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:01,989
It's not illegal to play e-sports.

473
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:05,189
It's illegal in their family.

474
00:23:05,189 --> 00:23:05,830
Family law

475
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,070
Buckle up.

476
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,469
Tell them to wait for me.

477
00:25:14,469 --> 00:25:15,390
I'll be right back.

478
00:25:15,949 --> 00:25:17,229
Aren't you going home after dinner?

479
00:25:19,429 --> 00:25:19,949
No more.

480
00:25:20,749 --> 00:25:21,709
Don't tell me earlier.

481
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,229
Fight with him.

482
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:26,909
It's a battle between mice and cats.

483
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,709
Will it end well?

484
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:30,030
Who wants to fight with him?

485
00:25:30,749 --> 00:25:32,110
I just want to train well.

486
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,070
Enough. Don't explain.

487
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,590
You are the Monkey King.

488
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:39,150
Can't escape from the Buddha's hand.

489
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,830
He has been a police for half his life.

490
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,429
There are many ways to deal with you.

491
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:43,150
Come and eat.

492
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:47,870
What can I do?

493
00:25:53,509 --> 00:25:54,189
mom

494
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,830
What can I do?

495
00:25:56,189 --> 00:25:57,509
How do I know what to do?

496
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:00,229
wrong

497
00:26:00,989 --> 00:26:02,030
You betrayed me.

498
00:26:02,669 --> 00:26:04,189
I don't know which internet café you are in.

499
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:05,189
How could I betray you?

500
00:26:05,709 --> 00:26:06,749
How did my dad know?

501
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,150
He guessed.

502
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,070
It's a guess.

503
00:26:09,469 --> 00:26:11,070
There are thousands of internet cafes on the Ning River.

504
00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:12,709
If he can guess correctly,

505
00:26:12,709 --> 00:26:13,749
He should buy lottery tickets.

506
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:15,749
mom

507
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:20,550
I'll tell you.

508
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,550
Your father has told the internet café nearby.

509
00:26:22,709 --> 00:26:23,790
As long as you go in,

510
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,229
They called your dad.

511
00:26:27,989 --> 00:26:28,749
son

512
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:31,269
It's all for your own good.

513
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,749
I thank him.

514
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:12,429
sorry

515
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:13,909
I shouldn't have told you that.

516
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:14,590
I was wrong.

517
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,350
Delete them all.

518
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,110
Is that necessary?

519
00:27:21,189 --> 00:27:21,709
what

520
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:22,709
love letter

521
00:27:24,749 --> 00:27:25,830
I'm joking with you.

522
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:27,870
Today,

523
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,189
When I saw your notebook,

524
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,110
Remember what the teacher said in class.

525
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,550
That's too inefficient.

526
00:27:32,709 --> 00:27:33,630
These ones here

527
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,630
Are all my notes from grade one to grade three.

528
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,350
And the wrong answers.

529
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,070
Above

530
00:27:37,229 --> 00:27:38,590
The detailed process of solving the problem.

531
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:39,830
I don't need it anymore.

532
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,310
But I don't think

533
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,909
If you want to improve quickly,

534
00:27:42,909 --> 00:27:43,669
It's important.

535
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,110
Do you run here every day?

536
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,030
Well

537
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,070
How far?

538
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,110
10km

539
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,310
Run ten kilometers.

540
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,350
What does it feel like?

541
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,749
The feeling of being hollowed out.

542
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,070
to hollow out

543
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:15,150
Every drop of sweat in your body

544
00:28:15,989 --> 00:28:17,030
Every minute of energy

545
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:18,269
anger

546
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:19,630
ashamed

547
00:28:20,469 --> 00:28:21,070
fear

548
00:28:21,989 --> 00:28:22,749
Will be pulled out.

549
00:28:24,429 --> 00:28:25,030
then

550
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,870
Then you can go home and sleep.

551
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:31,830
very good

552
00:28:32,989 --> 00:28:34,429
Ten kilometers of sleeping pills.

553
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:36,469
It has no side effects.

554
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:37,989
Tell me about you.

555
00:28:39,909 --> 00:28:40,989
Why are you playing games?

556
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,229
Don't tell me.

557
00:28:42,229 --> 00:28:43,150
Is also used as a sleeping pill.

558
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:47,429
I did it for my brother.

559
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,830
you

560
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:51,110
Your brother

561
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:52,749
No

562
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:54,949
At that time,

563
00:28:56,469 --> 00:28:58,189
Almost made it to the National Challenge.

564
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,949
therefore

565
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:03,790
You want to fulfill his unfinished dream.

566
00:29:12,469 --> 00:29:12,989
go

567
00:29:13,709 --> 00:29:14,590
I'll take you home.

568
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:15,909
I'm fine.

569
00:29:16,229 --> 00:29:17,070
go

570
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:20,070
It's dangerous for a girl to go home alone at night.

571
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,949
You really don't have to.

572
00:29:20,949 --> 00:29:21,350
you

573
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,350
Do you think it's you or me?

574
00:29:27,509 --> 00:29:28,030
That's enough.

575
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,110
I admit defeat.

576
00:29:31,949 --> 00:29:32,709
son

577
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:34,390
How nice you are now.

578
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:36,749
To work in such a big company.

579
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,870
Here we are.

580
00:29:38,189 --> 00:29:39,350
And his temperament has changed.

581
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,110
Xiao Feng.

582
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,509
Your uncle said that

583
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:45,669
I want to get your cousin a city residence.

584
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,590
Can you ask someone to help?

585
00:29:47,989 --> 00:29:48,749
a row

586
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:52,949
Director

587
00:29:52,949 --> 00:29:53,669
Xiao Xiao.

588
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,590
To work overtime tonight.

589
00:29:56,269 --> 00:29:58,030
I have an important task for you.

590
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,949
I'm sending you a location.

591
00:29:59,949 --> 00:30:00,989
Then come here.

592
00:30:00,989 --> 00:30:01,749
Alright.

593
00:30:01,749 --> 00:30:02,709
Be there soon.

594
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:04,469
Yes?

595
00:30:04,949 --> 00:30:06,030
The company asked you to work overtime.

596
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:06,830
Nothing

597
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,949
I'll send you back.

598
00:30:07,949 --> 00:30:08,550
No need

599
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:10,229
About work.

600
00:30:10,229 --> 00:30:11,110
That's a big deal.

601
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,350
You must behave yourself.

602
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,989
It's not easy to have a job.

603
00:30:13,989 --> 00:30:15,630
If the leader asks you to work overtime, go.

604
00:30:15,949 --> 00:30:16,749
Go.

605
00:30:16,749 --> 00:30:17,590
Then I'm leaving.

606
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,269
Let's go.

607
00:30:18,269 --> 00:30:19,150
I dare not drink it.

608
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:19,830
I'll drink it first.

609
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,310
You drank too much.

610
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:20,830
No

611
00:30:21,189 --> 00:30:21,949
Look.

612
00:30:21,949 --> 00:30:22,949
Just be mean.

613
00:30:22,949 --> 00:30:24,070
Look, I've finished it.

614
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,189
You can't do that.

615
00:30:25,509 --> 00:30:26,189
Director

616
00:30:26,189 --> 00:30:27,390
Zhang, hurry up.

617
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,150
You know,

618
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:28,709
They brought their own.

619
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,030
Xiao Xiao.

620
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:30,709
come

621
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:31,469
fast

622
00:30:31,469 --> 00:30:32,070
Xiao Xiao.

623
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,150
How many leaders

624
00:30:33,509 --> 00:30:34,350
Come on, Xiao. Hurry up.

625
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:34,909
sit

626
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:36,390
Xiao Xiao, I'm relieved.

627
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,429
This is Xiao from the Planning Department.

628
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:38,830
Xiao Xiao.

629
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,150
Xiao, you look handsome.

630
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,150
You're doing a good job.

631
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,189
The most important thing is

632
00:30:42,469 --> 00:30:43,390
The wine is good.

633
00:30:44,749 --> 00:30:45,709
Come on, Xiao.

634
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:48,030
To show the elegance of our Planning Department.

635
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:48,630
What about

636
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:49,189
Have a drink.

637
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,070
Have a drink.

638
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:52,150
Watch

639
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,229
good

640
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,189
good

641
00:30:56,909 --> 00:30:57,550
This young man

642
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:57,989
come

643
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,390
It doesn't count.

644
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,790
What doesn't count.

645
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,550
Take a look.

646
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:02,949
Now,

647
00:31:03,469 --> 00:31:04,350
This one.

648
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:04,870
Your Majesty.

649
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:05,749
And surrogacy.

650
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:06,989
That's not the same thing.

651
00:31:06,989 --> 00:31:08,390
Why can't you drink it for me?

652
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,590
What's his level?

653
00:31:09,989 --> 00:31:11,790
You can ask him to drink it for you.

654
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,310
Three drinks is on you.

655
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,150
Okay, this is good.

656
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:14,550
How about this?

657
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,550
This is so fair.

658
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,189
Support

659
00:31:16,189 --> 00:31:16,949
this

660
00:31:16,949 --> 00:31:18,229
The leaders didn't bully you.

661
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:19,870
When I was your age,

662
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:20,989
I'm the same way.

663
00:31:20,989 --> 00:31:22,509
I'll have one. The leaders have three.

664
00:31:22,509 --> 00:31:23,269
No

665
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:25,070
I'll have three drinks. The leaders.

666
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:26,749
Follow this rule today.

667
00:31:26,749 --> 00:31:27,550
come

668
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,630
Then drink it.

669
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,269
Have a drink.

670
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:30,989
Director, I can't drink too much.

671
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,269
Xiao, I'm telling you,

672
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,350
These leaders are very important today.

673
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,350
Have a drink today.

674
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,630
It's likely that your organization

675
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:40,949
You'll be promoted one day earlier.

676
00:31:40,949 --> 00:31:42,709
Two drinks may be two days earlier.

677
00:31:42,709 --> 00:31:43,590
I'm telling you,

678
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,429
The wine field is like a battlefield.

679
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:46,590
You won the battle.

680
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,870
Is more powerful than anything.

681
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,669
Think about it.

682
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:49,949
come

683
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:50,390
such

684
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,070
That

685
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,429
Xiao, on behalf of me,

686
00:31:52,429 --> 00:31:53,909
To the leaders.

687
00:31:53,909 --> 00:31:54,429
all right?

688
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:54,790
good

689
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,909
He has three drinks. You have one.

690
00:31:55,909 --> 00:31:56,790
Xiao, come on.

691
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,350
To show them

692
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,709
Come on, Xiao.

693
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:00,269
Hurry up

694
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,790
I'll pour it for you after drinking.

695
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,030
can

696
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:02,509
Come on, Xiao.

697
00:32:02,509 --> 00:32:02,989
come

698
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:04,749
Leaders,

699
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:05,630
I did it.

700
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,150
Make yourself at home.

701
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:07,949
Xiao Xiao.

702
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,669
Come on.

703
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:10,469
It's done.

704
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:12,429
See?

705
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,150
This kid is good.

706
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,830
Alright.

707
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,229
This young man is good.

708
00:32:22,229 --> 00:32:23,229
What is it called?

709
00:32:23,229 --> 00:32:24,830
Xiao xiao feng

710
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,790
The Planning Department

711
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,469
The peak of drinking.

712
00:32:28,469 --> 00:32:29,310
You're so ambitious.

713
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,550
Bring him here next time.

714
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,550
You're still awake.

715
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:48,790
Well

716
00:32:48,989 --> 00:32:50,150
I have to stay up late tonight.

717
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,709
I have to finish my paper.

718
00:32:51,949 --> 00:32:53,870
The Great Wall you built?

719
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,269
Do you need to fix it all the time?

720
00:32:56,269 --> 00:32:57,269
It's different this time.

721
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:58,870
The instructor I applied for

722
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:59,949
He called me.

723
00:32:59,949 --> 00:33:02,550
He said he loved my paper after reading it.

724
00:33:02,749 --> 00:33:05,030
Should be recommended for publication in core journals.

725
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,709
It's very helpful for me to take the postgraduate exam.

726
00:33:09,229 --> 00:33:11,229
You're nerd enough.

727
00:33:14,189 --> 00:33:15,189
Do you want to

728
00:33:15,909 --> 00:33:17,310
Keep reading it.

729
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,469
Be careful you can't get married.

730
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:21,709
It's none of your business

731
00:33:42,909 --> 00:33:43,949
Why are you drinking so much?

732
00:33:43,949 --> 00:33:46,150
Ethanol can affect the function of various organs in the body.

733
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,590
It can also damage memory.

734
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,550
You don't understand.

735
00:33:51,189 --> 00:33:52,709
You can block the wine for the leader.

736
00:33:54,709 --> 00:33:55,709
It shows that the leader

737
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,949
And trust me.

738
00:33:59,949 --> 00:34:01,790
Don't look at me. I just went there.

739
00:34:04,229 --> 00:34:05,669
Leader, as long as you have something,

740
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,429
The first one.

741
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:11,989
You must be thinking of me.

742
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,229
No one else wants to use it.

743
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,630
Do you know why?

744
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:18,830
why

745
00:34:21,709 --> 00:34:22,669
because

746
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,070
I

747
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:27,709
sensible

748
00:34:30,509 --> 00:34:31,469
I have a good eye.

749
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,269
I'm obedient.

750
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:54,350
The leader is thirsty.

751
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:57,949
I'll get some water.

752
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:00,390
The leader is hungry.

753
00:35:02,909 --> 00:35:04,229
I'm going to buy KFC.

754
00:35:05,509 --> 00:35:06,909
The leader's idea

755
00:35:08,269 --> 00:35:10,110
As your own idea.

756
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,469
In this way,

757
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,830
Will never be wrong.

758
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,949
They all said

759
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,429
The way I used to be,

760
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:39,709
You picked the wrong one.

761
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,870
I don't understand.

762
00:35:50,709 --> 00:35:52,150
I put my own hobby

763
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,030
As a profession.

764
00:35:58,429 --> 00:35:59,390
As an ideal.

765
00:36:01,429 --> 00:36:02,070
one

766
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:05,310
I didn't steal it.

767
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,269
two

768
00:36:11,189 --> 00:36:12,070
I didn't take it.

769
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:13,949
three

770
00:36:15,509 --> 00:36:17,030
I didn't hurt anyone.

771
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,189
What did I do wrong?

772
00:36:22,189 --> 00:36:23,269
I don't understand.

773
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:26,949
What did I do wrong?

774
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:12,749
Are you all right?

775
00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:14,510
You don't even know what happened

776
00:37:15,229 --> 00:37:16,789
I'm helping the leader.

777
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:18,669
Director

778
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,150
Such a big pot.

779
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,510
I'll do it all.

780
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,150
You're really good.

781
00:37:23,669 --> 00:37:25,470
One of you sent a table of people from other departments

782
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,630
You're dead.

783
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,630
The director praised you this morning.

784
00:37:29,229 --> 00:37:30,269
You have a bright future.

785
00:37:30,269 --> 00:37:32,269
The approval will come down soon.

786
00:37:38,869 --> 00:37:39,630
Where is this?

787
00:37:40,309 --> 00:37:41,110
You got dizzy.

788
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,950
This is today's northern suburbs demolition.

789
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:46,150
We're responsible for the policy of promoting the demolition.

790
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:46,669
Take a look.

791
00:37:46,669 --> 00:37:48,869
Now the government has planned your area.

792
00:37:48,869 --> 00:37:50,150
Now, we have to pay for the demolition.

793
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,229
Demolition

794
00:37:51,229 --> 00:37:52,189
Yes

795
00:37:52,189 --> 00:37:53,189
How much?

796
00:37:53,189 --> 00:37:55,070
This is according to your years.

797
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:55,789
I'll pay for it.

798
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,789
If it's more than two months,

799
00:37:58,789 --> 00:37:59,430
That would be

800
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,189
Can only be compensated.

801
00:38:08,309 --> 00:38:09,070
Catch a pig!

802
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,309
stupid swine

803
00:39:01,869 --> 00:39:03,309
Now you're running happily.

804
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,070
I'll starve you in a couple of days.

805
00:39:06,189 --> 00:39:06,950
Really

806
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:11,349
Even a pig dares to follow his own path.

807
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,669
I'm worse than a pig.

808
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,070
You're still drunk.

809
00:39:17,669 --> 00:39:19,150
It seems I drank a lot last night.

810
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:20,709
Help this.

811
00:39:21,669 --> 00:39:22,550
Stop

812
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,110
other

813
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,030
Don't let it get away.

814
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,110
Some time ago,

815
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,550
Because of our joint efforts,

816
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,550
The results of our work last month

817
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,430
Was approved by the district leader.

818
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,510
Gave us a big thumbs up.

819
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:36,910
It's here.

820
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:37,950
I want to remind everyone

821
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,470
We must guard against arrogance and rashness.

822
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,389
Continue to put our work

823
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,510
And do a better job.

824
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:41,990
all right?

825
00:39:45,869 --> 00:39:46,470
In addition

826
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,869
I have good news for you.

827
00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:51,430
Our new comrade from the Planning Department

828
00:39:52,669 --> 00:39:53,189
Xiao Feng.

829
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:55,590
His application for admission.

830
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:56,630
Has been officially approved.

831
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,950
We can get it as soon as next week.

832
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,550
So everyone is here today.

833
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,349
I want to take advantage of this

834
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:03,070
Let's go together.

835
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:04,910
Congratulations to Comrade Xiao Feng.

836
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:07,070
And become a member of our Planning Department.

837
00:40:11,189 --> 00:40:11,869
Xiao Feng.

838
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:12,709
Smile when you're happy.

839
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:13,789
To share with you.

840
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:14,829
Welcome.

841
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:25,389
Thank you for your support and cultivation.

842
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,829
And thank you for

843
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:30,269
And help me.

844
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,389
sorry

845
00:40:33,789 --> 00:40:35,070
I decided to quit the job.

846
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:45,950
Xiao Xiao.

847
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,550
What were you talking about?

848
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:50,150
I said I would quit the job.

849
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,349
Xiao, are you kidding me?

850
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,430
Such a good job.

851
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,550
How many people dream of

852
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:56,990
What are you thinking?

853
00:40:59,869 --> 00:41:01,309
I want to do what I like to do.

854
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:03,950
naive

855
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,950
Who doesn't want to be what they like?

856
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,669
Your career is just getting on track.

857
00:41:08,669 --> 00:41:10,110
During the rising period,

858
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:10,950
I'm telling you,

859
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:13,550
Don't make any choice when you're impulsive.

860
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,150
Choice is more important than hard work.

861
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:16,869
The choice you made today

862
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,669
It doesn't matter to anyone.

863
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,389
But I have to warn you.

864
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:21,869
Your father will be sad.

865
00:41:22,869 --> 00:41:24,430
He will be disappointed with you.

866
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,030
Director

867
00:41:27,709 --> 00:41:28,990
I don't want to disappoint myself.

868
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,990
To keep the iron bowl stable.

869
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,349
This is the ideal of most people.

870
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:34,789
It's not mine.

871
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,669
I don't want to do.

872
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,030
Can endure for a while.

873
00:41:38,389 --> 00:41:39,669
But I can't bear it for a lifetime.

874
00:41:40,229 --> 00:41:41,470
Love can't be hidden.

875
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,389
It's like a fire wrapped in paper.

876
00:41:43,669 --> 00:41:44,950
If it goes out one day,

877
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,669
There's no difference between living and dying.

878
00:41:46,669 --> 00:41:47,470
It's not you.

879
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,829
When people make a decision,

880
00:41:48,829 --> 00:41:49,950
It will take a long time.

881
00:41:50,749 --> 00:41:52,349
You have to argue with yourself repeatedly.

882
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:53,990
You have to be 100% sure you're doing the right thing.

883
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:54,950
That's why I made the decision.

884
00:41:55,269 --> 00:41:56,389
But most of the time,

885
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,070
People don't think.

886
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:00,990
But there's a voice inside.

887
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:01,789
I've been telling you

888
00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:03,510
You're doing the right thing.

889
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,550
What makes you think you're right?

890
00:42:06,229 --> 00:42:07,590
I warned you repeatedly.

891
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,389
You should think more.

892
00:42:09,389 --> 00:42:10,789
What are you thinking?

893
00:42:14,829 --> 00:42:15,950
I want to be a pig.

894
00:42:19,749 --> 00:42:21,829
A pig who jumped out of the pen to pursue freedom.

895
00:42:22,389 --> 00:42:23,349
You're

896
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:24,990
Are you crazy?

897
00:42:32,269 --> 00:42:33,150
Thank you, Director.

898
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:05,150
This is high quality.

899
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:06,349
This time,

900
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:07,950
It won't be lost.

901
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,630
There seems to be an internet.

902
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:11,630
I'm also connected here.

903
00:43:12,749 --> 00:43:13,510
to do oneself

904
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:14,389
Have ample food and clothing

905
00:43:14,389 --> 00:43:15,349
From now on,

906
00:43:15,349 --> 00:43:16,829
We don't have to go to the internet cafe anymore.

907
00:43:16,829 --> 00:43:18,229
This is our training camp.

908
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:19,789
Pretty good

909
00:43:19,789 --> 00:43:21,229
There is a time to reuse waste.

910
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:23,309
How can you speak?

911
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,590
You always sound so weird.

912
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:25,309
It's like swearing.

913
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:26,030
ChengHao

914
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:27,189
I'm telling you, your marksmanship

915
00:43:27,189 --> 00:43:28,749
If I can maintain it at half your level,

916
00:43:28,749 --> 00:43:30,349
And I don't have to wipe my ass behind you.

917
00:43:31,389 --> 00:43:31,749
That's enough.

918
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:32,789
Let's start training.

919
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:38,269
Who is it?

920
00:43:44,189 --> 00:43:44,749
Your father.

921
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:46,150
What should we do?

922
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:47,070
My dad

923
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:47,829
Lu Xiao Bei,

924
00:43:48,269 --> 00:43:48,990
Open the door

925
00:43:52,349 --> 00:43:53,550
Lu Xiao Bei, open the door.

926
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:55,189
Open the door.

927
00:43:59,189 --> 00:44:00,309
Uncle, you're here.

928
00:44:13,229 --> 00:44:14,470
Who asked you to play games?

929
00:44:15,749 --> 00:44:16,669
It's a weekend.

930
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,070
Official holidays.

931
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:20,110
The police don't know the holidays.

932
00:44:24,869 --> 00:44:25,349
go

933
00:44:25,349 --> 00:44:26,070
Go back with me.

934
00:45:39,789 --> 00:45:42,150
What's the problem in their family?

935
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:45,910
It's a long story

936
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:48,630
If my brother is still here,

937
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:51,990
Would you stop him from playing games?

938
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:54,110
Eleven years have passed.

939
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:57,070
You still can't get over your brother's problem.

940
00:45:57,349 --> 00:45:58,309
Did you go there?

941
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:01,110
Eleven years ago.

942
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:02,470
You've been looking for the murderer.

943
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:03,630
What are you trying to say

944
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:04,550
What do you want?

945
00:46:05,269 --> 00:46:06,910
I want to be a professional e-sports player.

946
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:08,030
Finish what he didn't finish.

947
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:08,829
What does that prove?

948
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:10,229
To prove that he lived in the world.

949
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:11,070
It's you.

950
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:11,950
He's him.

951
00:46:15,389 --> 00:46:16,309
No matter what you did,

952
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:20,030
you

953
00:46:20,709 --> 00:46:21,630
Your brother won't be back.

954
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:23,189
Brother

955
00:46:23,189 --> 00:46:25,110
The rain is too heavy.
