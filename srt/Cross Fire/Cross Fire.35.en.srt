1
00:02:23,438 --> 00:02:24,037
Xiao Feng.

2
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,158
hello

3
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:37,637
I'm the coach of TNT.

4
00:02:37,838 --> 00:02:40,198
Please take care of me when we meet for the first time.

5
00:02:56,198 --> 00:02:57,637
How is Xiao Bei?

6
00:02:57,918 --> 00:02:59,798
There are twelve stitches in his right hand.

7
00:02:59,798 --> 00:03:01,197
The doctor asked to stay in the hospital for observation.

8
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:05,078
It will take at least two weeks to remove the stitches.

9
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:08,998
It's obvious that we want to destroy Xiao Bei.

10
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:11,518
Did Xu Wei do it?

11
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:14,277
The police are still investigating.

12
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:17,238
No matter who ordered it,

13
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,598
He must know it well.

14
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:19,477
Xiao Bei is not here.

15
00:03:19,477 --> 00:03:20,598
How much will it affect us?

16
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:32,837
come

17
00:03:38,638 --> 00:03:41,598
North is the soul of their team.

18
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,158
Without him, the team will be a second-rate team.

19
00:03:46,078 --> 00:03:47,277
I'm sorry.

20
00:03:47,718 --> 00:03:50,518
No chance to see North.

21
00:03:51,037 --> 00:03:53,998
When you hold the world championship trophy,

22
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:55,638
He will see it.

23
00:04:06,877 --> 00:04:09,638
People who play games want to be the strongest.

24
00:04:10,078 --> 00:04:11,238
Wants to win the championship.

25
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:14,518
You and Xiao Bei have come all the way here.

26
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:17,358
Is to win this game.

27
00:04:20,877 --> 00:04:22,437
Brother Feng, don't worry.

28
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:24,958
We will definitely fight hard today.

29
00:04:27,198 --> 00:04:28,758
You must avenge the captain.

30
00:04:31,157 --> 00:04:33,117
Even if Xiao Bei plays today,

31
00:04:33,117 --> 00:04:34,397
No one will believe it.

32
00:04:34,397 --> 00:04:36,078
The team can defeat Japan.

33
00:04:36,798 --> 00:04:38,478
They don't know how many falls you've had.

34
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:39,758
How much I suffered?

35
00:04:40,318 --> 00:04:42,078
How much sweat and tears I paid.

36
00:04:42,597 --> 00:04:44,597
So today,

37
00:04:44,597 --> 00:04:46,078
To make them remember our names.

38
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:47,318
Go on.

39
00:04:47,758 --> 00:04:48,358
Come on

40
00:04:54,557 --> 00:04:55,397
Oh, my god.

41
00:04:55,638 --> 00:04:57,318
If Captain North can't play today,

42
00:04:57,318 --> 00:04:58,877
How can we defeat them?

43
00:04:58,877 --> 00:05:00,518
Such a strong TNT team.

44
00:05:00,638 --> 00:05:01,478
That's a problem.

45
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:03,318
Go on, team. Come on.

46
00:05:03,318 --> 00:05:06,437
The battle lineup given by the team

47
00:05:06,437 --> 00:05:08,557
Will replace North with C you.

48
00:05:08,557 --> 00:05:09,198
It's a pity.

49
00:05:09,198 --> 00:05:11,358
North missed the semi-finals because of injury.

50
00:05:11,358 --> 00:05:12,798
But I guess I can only regret it.

51
00:05:12,798 --> 00:05:14,478
The next Crossfire World Finals.

52
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:17,277
Go on.

53
00:05:30,198 --> 00:05:33,717
I noticed that North's right hand seemed to be injured.

54
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:34,877
Really?

55
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:35,638
Xiaobei

56
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:01,918
I need to check

57
00:06:02,277 --> 00:06:03,318
His hand is injured.

58
00:06:03,318 --> 00:06:05,238
Just received treatment.

59
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:06,078
let it be

60
00:06:07,837 --> 00:06:08,798
Let him see it.

61
00:06:23,998 --> 00:06:26,438
Are you sure you want to play this game?

62
00:06:27,917 --> 00:06:29,357
I'm here to fight.

63
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,237
As a doctor, I have to remind you

64
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:32,998
The price of doing this

65
00:06:33,558 --> 00:06:35,157
Do what you want to do.

66
00:06:35,157 --> 00:06:36,998
Will pay the price.

67
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:38,477
If I miss this game,

68
00:06:39,438 --> 00:06:40,837
I will regret it forever.

69
00:06:44,558 --> 00:06:45,277
Please enter.

70
00:06:55,318 --> 00:06:56,878
We just got the news.

71
00:06:56,878 --> 00:06:58,318
Go on, captain North.

72
00:06:58,318 --> 00:06:59,518
Arrived at the scene.

73
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:00,638
They will still

74
00:07:00,638 --> 00:07:01,998
The main force of the whole team.

75
00:07:10,037 --> 00:07:28,717
North

76
00:07:43,438 --> 00:07:44,998
You're still here.

77
00:07:48,638 --> 00:07:49,397
I'm late.

78
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:57,157
Xiaobei

79
00:07:57,758 --> 00:07:58,758
Why are you here?

80
00:07:59,477 --> 00:08:00,717
You need to rest now.

81
00:08:02,758 --> 00:08:04,277
I have to clean up those bastards.

82
00:08:06,558 --> 00:08:07,397
Lu Xiao Bei,

83
00:08:07,638 --> 00:08:08,837
Can you hit with your hands?

84
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:13,037
It's a tough fight.

85
00:08:13,558 --> 00:08:14,477
To compete.

86
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:18,597
Enough

87
00:08:19,597 --> 00:08:21,397
What did Doctor Chuge say?

88
00:08:21,397 --> 00:08:22,357
Why didn't you stop him?

89
00:08:23,477 --> 00:08:24,917
The doctor gave him a pain-killing injection.

90
00:08:25,318 --> 00:08:26,318
You know him.

91
00:08:26,638 --> 00:08:27,678
What he wants to do.

92
00:08:28,078 --> 00:08:29,198
No one can stop him.

93
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:41,237
Are you crazy?

94
00:08:42,357 --> 00:08:43,357
If it were you,

95
00:08:44,438 --> 00:08:45,758
You will do the same.

96
00:08:49,998 --> 00:08:51,318
Are you sure you can

97
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,277
Do you believe me?

98
00:08:59,237 --> 00:09:00,397
I won't lose.

99
00:09:05,037 --> 00:09:05,837
we

100
00:09:08,157 --> 00:09:09,078
He won't lose.

101
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,318
Go on.

102
00:09:21,998 --> 00:09:23,078
And wins.

103
00:09:30,357 --> 00:09:31,318
As everyone knows

104
00:09:31,318 --> 00:09:32,638
The Chinese team used to have

105
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:33,878
A very brilliant record.

106
00:09:34,037 --> 00:09:36,198
But the Japanese team has risen rapidly in the past two years.

107
00:09:36,397 --> 00:09:37,678
Changed the pattern of the Crossfire World Finals.

108
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,518
Before the semi-final starts,

109
00:09:39,518 --> 00:09:41,318
The two captains of China and Japan

110
00:09:41,318 --> 00:09:42,998
Will carry out their battle declaration.

111
00:09:44,797 --> 00:09:46,357
What I want to say is,

112
00:09:46,357 --> 00:09:48,078
China

113
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:50,037
Has become

114
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,678
History

115
00:09:57,477 --> 00:09:58,237
to talk drivel

116
00:09:59,397 --> 00:10:00,357
This is too arrogant.

117
00:10:05,118 --> 00:10:06,717
I want to tell the captain of the Japanese team.

118
00:10:09,438 --> 00:10:10,357
Some dreams.

119
00:10:11,357 --> 00:10:12,157
Don't do it.

120
00:10:16,118 --> 00:10:16,958
pretty

121
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,277
The road is small and hard.

122
00:10:18,277 --> 00:10:19,237
Xiaobei

123
00:10:19,237 --> 00:10:28,518
Go Team China.

124
00:10:28,717 --> 00:10:31,078
Come on, Chinese team.

125
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:37,038
Go Team China.

126
00:10:37,198 --> 00:10:37,837
Didn't Xiao Feng say that

127
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,517
Did Xu Wei coach the Japanese team?

128
00:10:39,517 --> 00:10:40,438
Why didn't you see him?

129
00:10:40,918 --> 00:10:42,117
How dare he go there?

130
00:10:42,438 --> 00:10:43,757
Such a bad guy like him.

131
00:10:44,158 --> 00:10:46,117
Can't survive more than two episodes.

132
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,757
It won't end well.

133
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:51,278
Don't talk about it.

134
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:52,237
Look.

135
00:10:52,237 --> 00:10:54,597
The Japanese team looks really strong.

136
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,918
I don't think it's easy.

137
00:10:58,318 --> 00:11:00,958
Don't worry if you have a captain.

138
00:11:03,717 --> 00:11:06,597
Cross Fire World Finals Semifinals in 2011

139
00:11:06,597 --> 00:11:07,477
The first round.

140
00:11:07,477 --> 00:11:09,078
From now on,

141
00:11:10,597 --> 00:11:11,237
Come on

142
00:11:19,517 --> 00:11:20,517
The opposite side is strong.

143
00:11:20,517 --> 00:11:21,877
To eat us all in one go.

144
00:11:22,318 --> 00:11:23,958
Let's slow down the pace after we start.

145
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:24,958
Cover Xiao Bei.

146
00:11:25,357 --> 00:11:25,757
Received

147
00:11:25,877 --> 00:11:26,357
Received

148
00:11:26,757 --> 00:11:27,198
Received

149
00:11:40,678 --> 00:11:42,237
Su Jiayi and Nezha are on the road.

150
00:11:44,198 --> 00:11:45,038
attack

151
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,517
There are three people on the side of the defender.

152
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:47,798
I'll go around the back.

153
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:49,278
I'm here.

154
00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:49,997
We ran into each other.

155
00:11:50,597 --> 00:11:51,517
Pull it out and face the gun.

156
00:11:51,517 --> 00:11:51,918
fall

157
00:11:51,918 --> 00:11:52,517
Beautiful. Okay.

158
00:11:52,517 --> 00:11:54,477
Su Jiayi successfully took Vais away.

159
00:11:55,117 --> 00:11:56,477
cover

160
00:11:56,477 --> 00:11:57,678
attack

161
00:11:57,678 --> 00:11:58,357
The front is fast.

162
00:11:58,357 --> 00:11:59,757
Support me!

163
00:11:59,757 --> 00:12:00,757
Nezha was defeated.

164
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:03,438
Su Jiayi was also knocked out.

165
00:12:03,438 --> 00:12:04,038
Back, back.

166
00:12:04,198 --> 00:12:05,757
The guard can change the path.

167
00:12:05,757 --> 00:12:07,038
They're too fast. They...

168
00:12:07,038 --> 00:12:07,798
I'll seal a cigarette.

169
00:12:07,798 --> 00:12:08,637
Move back. Move away.

170
00:12:08,637 --> 00:12:09,637
I'll help prevent it.

171
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:13,438
The middle door.

172
00:12:13,637 --> 00:12:14,237
I was targeted.

173
00:12:19,357 --> 00:12:20,477
Nino, come on.

174
00:12:20,477 --> 00:12:21,477
OK!

175
00:12:25,357 --> 00:12:25,798
I dropped it.

176
00:12:29,877 --> 00:12:31,837
Why is there only one team left?

177
00:12:31,837 --> 00:12:33,117
North is alone.

178
00:12:40,517 --> 00:12:41,597
Siege him, siege him

179
00:12:41,877 --> 00:12:42,237
Received

180
00:12:42,597 --> 00:12:43,198
attack

181
00:12:47,798 --> 00:12:48,678
North, seal the smoke.

182
00:12:48,997 --> 00:12:50,918
But the opponent has found his position.

183
00:12:52,757 --> 00:12:54,597
The opponent threw the grenades,

184
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:02,717
North has to pull back.

185
00:13:03,558 --> 00:13:05,517
But Machine is waiting for this chance.

186
00:13:14,558 --> 00:13:16,278
And knocked out North with one shot.

187
00:13:30,918 --> 00:13:31,678
Nothing

188
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:32,717
Hold on.

189
00:13:32,918 --> 00:13:33,877
Let's play the next round.

190
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:35,477
Xiao Bei is so hard.

191
00:13:35,798 --> 00:13:37,117
Take the middle road to avoid the point.

192
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:38,398
Find a way to trick him from behind.

193
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:39,918
You know it well.

194
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:41,837
It seems that Machine and his teammates

195
00:13:41,837 --> 00:13:43,117
Are in good condition.

196
00:13:43,117 --> 00:13:44,117
I don't know what will happen next.

197
00:13:44,117 --> 00:13:45,477
Will they let the team

198
00:13:45,477 --> 00:13:46,637
There's a chance to counter-attack.

199
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:47,918
Come on

200
00:13:48,318 --> 00:13:48,717
Come on

201
00:13:48,918 --> 00:13:49,798
Let's play 32A.

202
00:13:49,798 --> 00:13:50,678
King, come with me.

203
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:51,357
good

204
00:13:51,678 --> 00:13:52,678
Received

205
00:14:05,558 --> 00:14:06,237
King, give me a flash.

206
00:14:12,158 --> 00:14:12,398
on

207
00:14:15,558 --> 00:14:16,757
One battery is gone.

208
00:14:16,757 --> 00:14:18,637
I was besieged at the battery.

209
00:14:18,637 --> 00:14:19,637
Come and help.

210
00:14:19,877 --> 00:14:20,237
Received

211
00:14:27,837 --> 00:14:29,357
And the back of the box.

212
00:14:29,357 --> 00:14:30,798
You're really annoying.

213
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:37,597
One came out of the door.

214
00:14:37,597 --> 00:14:38,357
King, fill the gun.

215
00:14:38,357 --> 00:14:38,837
Received

216
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:53,198
It's so beautiful.

217
00:14:54,717 --> 00:14:55,477
Nice work.

218
00:14:56,117 --> 00:14:56,597
Xiaobei

219
00:14:57,038 --> 00:14:57,798
How is your hand?

220
00:14:59,078 --> 00:14:59,837
I'm fine.

221
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:04,798
Come on

222
00:15:04,798 --> 00:15:07,078
Don't let that jerk in the back laugh.

223
00:15:08,357 --> 00:15:09,837
I will make him cry.

224
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:14,837
Two in the middle.

225
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:15,837
Get inside. Get in.

226
00:15:18,678 --> 00:15:18,997
to tear down

227
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:20,117
pretty

228
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:23,517
I dropped one. I lost one.

229
00:15:23,517 --> 00:15:25,278
I'm coming.

230
00:15:27,117 --> 00:15:27,517
pretty

231
00:15:27,517 --> 00:15:28,477
Two off.

232
00:15:29,438 --> 00:15:30,038
to tear down

233
00:15:30,357 --> 00:15:31,678
It's so beautiful.

234
00:15:32,717 --> 00:15:33,318
It's gone.

235
00:15:33,318 --> 00:15:34,357
pretty

236
00:15:35,678 --> 00:15:36,517
He dropped it.

237
00:15:44,438 --> 00:15:45,398
You can go.

238
00:15:46,717 --> 00:15:47,558
It's all gone.

239
00:15:47,558 --> 00:15:48,597
pretty

240
00:15:51,637 --> 00:15:52,958
Cover and cover.

241
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:53,597
Received

242
00:15:56,877 --> 00:15:57,637
And knocked it off.

243
00:15:58,757 --> 00:15:59,958
pretty

244
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:04,958
Side Road Smoke Seal

245
00:16:05,237 --> 00:16:05,517
Received

246
00:16:05,517 --> 00:16:09,038
North

247
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,678
The competition was too fierce.

248
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:16,798
With the wonderful performance of Lu Xiabei,

249
00:16:16,798 --> 00:16:18,278
Go on. At the last moment,

250
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:19,678
Miraculously, she caught up with him.

251
00:16:23,237 --> 00:16:24,918
If they can pull one more point back,

252
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:26,477
The first round will be

253
00:16:26,477 --> 00:16:28,318
Five rounds of overtime.

254
00:16:28,597 --> 00:16:29,798
Many people think that

255
00:16:29,798 --> 00:16:31,678
Go on, team, in front of TNT,

256
00:16:31,678 --> 00:16:32,637
Cannot withstand a single blow

257
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,798
The reality, my friends.

258
00:16:34,798 --> 00:16:35,678
The Crossing Fire Professional League.

259
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:37,357
The champion team of exclusive skin.

260
00:16:37,357 --> 00:16:39,517
Their strength is very strong.

261
00:16:39,837 --> 00:16:40,877
Can't be underestimated.

262
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:42,198
I pulled back.

263
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,038
Get rid of him.

264
00:16:44,038 --> 00:16:44,517
Received

265
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,078
The last one.

266
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:48,837
I'll hold it in the back.

267
00:16:50,597 --> 00:16:51,558
I dropped it behind the box.

268
00:16:51,558 --> 00:16:52,237
It's behind the box.

269
00:17:27,357 --> 00:17:28,117
Hold still

270
00:17:28,637 --> 00:17:29,357
Hold still

271
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:16,038
North made a mistake.

272
00:18:16,438 --> 00:18:17,837
He didn't take away his opponent.

273
00:18:17,837 --> 00:18:19,278
But exposed himself.

274
00:18:19,678 --> 00:18:20,877
What a pity.

275
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:23,837
TNT won the point.

276
00:18:24,158 --> 00:18:25,278
And won the first round.

277
00:18:31,237 --> 00:18:32,517
Amazing

278
00:18:36,278 --> 00:18:37,637
You go to the battle room first.

279
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:38,757
I'll get the ice pack.

280
00:18:40,477 --> 00:18:42,517
I think this kind of mistake at a critical moment

281
00:18:42,517 --> 00:18:43,597
Let the team continue.

282
00:18:43,597 --> 00:18:45,837
And lost the chance to go to overtime.

283
00:18:45,837 --> 00:18:47,798
But there are two rounds left.

284
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:49,318
I hope the team can continue to work hard.

285
00:18:49,678 --> 00:18:50,117
that's right

286
00:18:50,117 --> 00:18:51,398
Please rest later.

287
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:53,278
The second round will begin soon.

288
00:18:57,158 --> 00:18:58,877
Although the Japanese team is amazing,

289
00:18:58,877 --> 00:19:00,637
But it's not as scary as the legend.

290
00:19:01,077 --> 00:19:02,317
They will make mistakes.

291
00:19:02,317 --> 00:19:03,838
There will be holes in the defense.

292
00:19:04,198 --> 00:19:05,557
We played very well.

293
00:19:05,757 --> 00:19:07,598
Can keep the score to 8-9.

294
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,878
It means we have no problem in technique and tactics.

295
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,277
The last shot is my fault.

296
00:19:13,997 --> 00:19:15,158
I shouldn't have made a mistake.

297
00:19:17,918 --> 00:19:18,797
It's not your fault.

298
00:19:19,317 --> 00:19:20,557
Your hand is injured.

299
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,358
If it wasn't for the second half of your shooting,

300
00:19:22,678 --> 00:19:24,237
The first one is long over.

301
00:19:29,198 --> 00:19:30,037
WangKai

302
00:19:30,037 --> 00:19:31,317
The endgame is determined.

303
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:32,077
Keep it up.

304
00:19:33,717 --> 00:19:34,398
Su Jiayi.

305
00:19:34,398 --> 00:19:35,638
The two rounds at Point B

306
00:19:35,638 --> 00:19:36,158
Very powerful.

307
00:19:38,118 --> 00:19:38,477
King

308
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,198
I love it when you go back to defense.

309
00:19:41,198 --> 00:19:42,077
Don't forget to search.

310
00:19:43,997 --> 00:19:44,477
Last

311
00:19:44,838 --> 00:19:46,118
I want to commend Nezha.

312
00:19:48,198 --> 00:19:50,198
The opposite Machine is annoying you.

313
00:19:50,638 --> 00:19:52,398
You're not so stubborn in love.

314
00:20:06,678 --> 00:20:08,158
The first round was too long.

315
00:20:08,158 --> 00:20:08,918
The effect is fast passing.

316
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:13,398
What about

317
00:20:13,918 --> 00:20:15,158
Can you stand it?

318
00:20:18,557 --> 00:20:19,878
To this point.

319
00:20:21,317 --> 00:20:22,878
I have no right to hold on.

320
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,358
I just found out

321
00:20:40,678 --> 00:20:41,477
At 8: 15,

322
00:20:41,477 --> 00:20:43,398
Pethidine hydrochloride injection.

323
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,077
He has a history of drug allergy.

324
00:20:45,358 --> 00:20:47,638
So the doctor gave a very, very small dose.

325
00:20:47,638 --> 00:20:48,517
After the effect,

326
00:20:48,517 --> 00:20:49,517
The pain will double.

327
00:20:58,277 --> 00:20:59,277
The game is about to begin.

328
00:20:59,277 --> 00:21:00,077
You can leave now.

329
00:21:05,517 --> 00:21:06,077
coach

330
00:21:07,997 --> 00:21:09,198
Xiao Bei is injured.

331
00:21:09,598 --> 00:21:11,277
The longer the time goes, the worse it will be for us.

332
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:12,598
Next time,

333
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,158
Let's make it quick.

334
00:21:16,797 --> 00:21:18,997
It's better to make a quick decision.

335
00:21:19,398 --> 00:21:21,237
But in the best of three games,

336
00:21:21,237 --> 00:21:22,598
The team that got the first round,

337
00:21:22,598 --> 00:21:24,077
The psychological advantage will be obvious.

338
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:25,398
They're in the next round.

339
00:21:25,398 --> 00:21:26,717
Will definitely slow down.

340
00:21:27,237 --> 00:21:28,717
All their attacking points

341
00:21:28,717 --> 00:21:30,237
At the core of them.

342
00:21:31,997 --> 00:21:33,557
They will definitely choose Machine.

343
00:21:34,477 --> 00:21:36,077
His marksmanship is so good.

344
00:21:36,077 --> 00:21:37,438
Can be used as a breakthrough.

345
00:21:42,797 --> 00:21:44,757
All of you will attack him next.

346
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,678
Don't care how many heads you give away.

347
00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:50,198
We must find a way.

348
00:21:50,198 --> 00:21:51,438
Wear down his trump card.

349
00:21:52,237 --> 00:21:53,277
We still have a chance.

350
00:21:54,838 --> 00:21:55,438
come

351
00:21:55,638 --> 00:21:57,557
Everyone will spend more time on Machine.

352
00:22:39,438 --> 00:22:40,277
Hold on.

353
00:22:40,678 --> 00:22:41,277
Don't worry.

354
00:22:41,398 --> 00:22:41,717
OK

355
00:22:41,717 --> 00:22:42,158
Understood. Received.

356
00:22:42,717 --> 00:22:43,918
Let's slow down.

357
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:45,077
Received

358
00:22:45,517 --> 00:22:47,958
Both sides changed their tactics at the beginning of the game.

359
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:49,438
And chose to use a pistol.

360
00:22:49,438 --> 00:22:51,158
No one wants to do it first.

361
00:22:51,398 --> 00:22:53,118
It seems that they want to go together.

362
00:23:27,438 --> 00:23:28,678
Until the end of this round,

363
00:23:28,678 --> 00:23:30,438
Only 40 seconds left.

364
00:23:30,438 --> 00:23:31,517
Let's have a look.

365
00:23:31,517 --> 00:23:33,958
Who will be the first to calm down?

366
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:46,438
attack

367
00:23:50,077 --> 00:23:50,717
King, move back.

368
00:23:50,717 --> 00:23:51,678
I saw Machine coming.

369
00:23:51,678 --> 00:23:51,997
I saw it.

370
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,198
Machine is too fast.

371
00:23:53,717 --> 00:23:55,158
He chose to attack from A.

372
00:23:58,757 --> 00:23:59,118
I dropped it.

373
00:23:59,118 --> 00:24:00,398
He killed King directly.

374
00:24:02,158 --> 00:24:02,717
I dropped it too.

375
00:24:02,997 --> 00:24:04,237
He knocked out S + 1 again.

376
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,438
I saw a shot.

377
00:24:09,358 --> 00:24:10,317
Kai is here.

378
00:24:10,317 --> 00:24:10,878
Two people ran into each other.

379
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:13,557
I dropped it.

380
00:24:13,557 --> 00:24:14,438
But you still have to take Kai.

381
00:24:14,438 --> 00:24:14,838
I saw it.

382
00:24:14,838 --> 00:24:15,717
I'll support you.

383
00:24:16,878 --> 00:24:18,077
I dropped it. It's here.

384
00:24:18,077 --> 00:24:18,958
I'll do it.

385
00:24:25,358 --> 00:24:26,517
Oh, my god.

386
00:24:26,517 --> 00:24:28,358
Machine completed a wave of one-to-five.

387
00:24:28,598 --> 00:24:30,317
The machine is the same as opening the door.

388
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:32,237
pretty

389
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:35,237
A wave of output just now.

390
00:24:35,237 --> 00:24:38,118
Can be selected as the best player of the season.

391
00:24:38,797 --> 00:24:39,438
That's right.

392
00:24:39,438 --> 00:24:41,878
He picked the whole team.

393
00:24:41,878 --> 00:24:43,878
He's a monster.

394
00:24:43,878 --> 00:24:45,398
Go on, team. Find it now.

395
00:24:45,398 --> 00:24:46,638
A suitable solution.

396
00:24:57,878 --> 00:24:59,477
Isn't the battle room air-conditioned?

397
00:24:59,477 --> 00:25:01,358
Why is Xiao Bei still sweating?

398
00:25:01,598 --> 00:25:03,198
Xiao Bei can't hold on anymore.

399
00:25:03,198 --> 00:25:04,918
His hand must be very painful now.

400
00:25:08,158 --> 00:25:09,438
It's almost time to change the dressing.

401
00:25:10,678 --> 00:25:11,477
How to do it?

402
00:25:20,158 --> 00:25:21,237
Captain, your hand is bleeding again.

403
00:25:21,237 --> 00:25:22,037
The gauze has infiltrated.

404
00:25:22,958 --> 00:25:24,358
We can't. Call a pause.

405
00:25:26,237 --> 00:25:26,997
I'm fine.

406
00:25:27,438 --> 00:25:28,517
Don't be distracted. Keep fighting.

407
00:25:49,878 --> 00:25:50,997
Two in the middle.

408
00:25:50,997 --> 00:25:51,517
Received

409
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,958
The other one is weak.

410
00:25:57,958 --> 00:25:58,638
Nice gun.

411
00:25:58,638 --> 00:25:59,997
I can throw Shan Nezha.

412
00:25:59,997 --> 00:26:00,918
I'm on it.

413
00:26:08,198 --> 00:26:08,797
I lost the middle road.

414
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:10,037
That's nice. Nice gun.

415
00:26:13,158 --> 00:26:13,717
I dropped it.

416
00:26:15,598 --> 00:26:16,158
I dropped it too.

417
00:26:17,797 --> 00:26:18,237
I dropped it.

418
00:26:30,438 --> 00:26:31,557
I dropped it at point A.

419
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:34,158
I dropped it too.

420
00:26:34,158 --> 00:26:35,077
Hold on.

421
00:26:37,037 --> 00:26:37,757
I dropped it.

422
00:26:41,358 --> 00:26:41,838
It fell off.

423
00:26:48,797 --> 00:26:49,358
Brother Feng,

424
00:26:49,838 --> 00:26:50,717
Do you still want to send it?

425
00:26:53,958 --> 00:26:54,918
I want to see

426
00:26:54,918 --> 00:26:56,037
How big is his appetite?

427
00:26:56,317 --> 00:26:57,717
But he is too hot now.

428
00:26:57,717 --> 00:26:58,757
It's worse than hanging.

429
00:27:00,237 --> 00:27:01,517
It will get cold at the top.

430
00:27:01,517 --> 00:27:02,598
He can't be so accurate all the time.

431
00:27:03,037 --> 00:27:03,477
Yes

432
00:27:04,438 --> 00:27:05,717
Even if it's a machine,

433
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,158
There are limits.

434
00:27:07,517 --> 00:27:08,077
that's right

435
00:27:08,438 --> 00:27:09,198
Continue to besiege him.

436
00:27:09,678 --> 00:27:10,678
I don't know if you've noticed,

437
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:12,198
From the last round,

438
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:13,598
He pulled to the center consciously.

439
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:14,598
Do you know why?

440
00:27:15,118 --> 00:27:17,158
He has started to make mistakes.

441
00:27:17,158 --> 00:27:18,158
He's not so accurate.

442
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:18,797
Yes

443
00:27:19,317 --> 00:27:20,838
It's said online that he's not well.

444
00:27:20,838 --> 00:27:22,878
She rarely exercises in front of the computer.

445
00:27:23,838 --> 00:27:25,317
His physical ability should be his short board.

446
00:27:26,638 --> 00:27:28,158
From the beginning to now, I've calculated

447
00:27:28,517 --> 00:27:29,997
He fired almost 150 shots.

448
00:27:30,438 --> 00:27:31,958
That's the most for any other competition.

449
00:27:32,358 --> 00:27:33,358
After 150 shots,

450
00:27:33,358 --> 00:27:34,958
His mistakes will be more and more.

451
00:27:35,158 --> 00:27:36,198
So next,

452
00:27:36,198 --> 00:27:37,198
Continue to besiege him.

453
00:27:37,678 --> 00:27:39,077
How long can he be accurate?

454
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:42,077
Received

455
00:27:43,158 --> 00:27:43,398
understand

456
00:27:44,277 --> 00:27:44,717
Come on

457
00:27:58,717 --> 00:27:59,598
He went to A.

458
00:27:59,598 --> 00:28:00,158
Received

459
00:28:00,438 --> 00:28:01,398
Hold on. Wait for him.

460
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:16,438
Xiao Bei, your takeout is here.

461
00:28:16,438 --> 00:28:17,638
Alright.

462
00:28:48,158 --> 00:28:48,757
Kai, watch my back.

463
00:28:48,757 --> 00:28:49,358
Copy that.

464
00:29:09,797 --> 00:29:11,638
pretty

465
00:29:11,638 --> 00:29:12,277
good

466
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,477
It's so annoying.

467
00:29:19,997 --> 00:29:20,997
Come on

468
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:26,118
You can win.

469
00:29:26,277 --> 00:29:26,997
Come on.

470
00:29:27,358 --> 00:29:27,878
Come on

471
00:29:28,757 --> 00:29:29,237
Come on

472
00:29:32,717 --> 00:29:33,878
Wang Kai and King go to watch B.

473
00:29:33,878 --> 00:29:35,158
The rest of you follow me.

474
00:29:35,158 --> 00:29:36,398
Received

475
00:29:37,717 --> 00:29:38,678
Take cover.

476
00:29:38,678 --> 00:29:39,358
Received

477
00:29:41,477 --> 00:29:42,358
A Throw Flash.

478
00:29:42,358 --> 00:29:42,797
I'm on.

479
00:29:42,797 --> 00:29:43,358
It's on.

480
00:29:46,517 --> 00:29:47,237
Abominable

481
00:29:47,237 --> 00:29:47,757
It's white.

482
00:29:47,757 --> 00:29:48,757
Up, up.

483
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,678
pretty

484
00:30:15,237 --> 00:30:16,638
Continue to cooperate with the team.

485
00:30:16,638 --> 00:30:17,838
Through the TNT defense.

486
00:30:18,198 --> 00:30:18,717
Kill them.

487
00:30:21,557 --> 00:30:21,838
And knocked it off.

488
00:30:21,838 --> 00:30:22,838
pretty

489
00:30:23,678 --> 00:30:25,037
We can see the Crossfire World Finals.

490
00:30:25,037 --> 00:30:26,557
Is not only a competition of skills and tactics,

491
00:30:26,557 --> 00:30:28,277
Is also a test of physical strength.

492
00:30:28,277 --> 00:30:29,158
Nine to eight.

493
00:30:29,358 --> 00:30:31,757
The team took the lead for the first time.

494
00:30:36,037 --> 00:30:37,438
You've overtaken us.

495
00:30:37,438 --> 00:30:38,438
match point

496
00:30:38,438 --> 00:30:39,277
Come on. Go.

497
00:30:39,277 --> 00:30:39,997
pretty

498
00:30:39,997 --> 00:30:40,878
You're going to lose.

499
00:30:40,878 --> 00:30:41,757
To suppress them.

500
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:43,037
Don't let them lead the way.

501
00:30:43,598 --> 00:30:44,958
Please return to your position.

502
00:30:45,918 --> 00:30:48,958
If we continue to fight, we're just dying.

503
00:30:49,358 --> 00:30:50,757
If the Japanese team loses,

504
00:30:50,757 --> 00:30:52,958
I'm willing to drink the water from the toilet.

505
00:30:54,158 --> 00:30:55,398
This is too arrogant.

506
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,237
Pack B, get rid of one.

507
00:30:59,237 --> 00:31:00,077
We lost one in the middle.

508
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:01,477
The middle door is missing.

509
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:02,958
The last two.

510
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:03,958
We're in no hurry.

511
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:05,277
There's enough time.

512
00:31:05,277 --> 00:31:06,517
Let's go to Grade A.

513
00:31:06,517 --> 00:31:07,717
Go to Big A. Go around and unpack it.

514
00:31:16,358 --> 00:31:17,477
The machine is off.

515
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:19,557
pretty

516
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:24,757
Wang Kai, go around A dog.

517
00:31:25,158 --> 00:31:25,398
good

518
00:31:25,398 --> 00:31:26,477
Three, two, one.

519
00:31:26,717 --> 00:31:27,557
A platform seals the smoke.

520
00:31:29,678 --> 00:31:30,077
three

521
00:31:30,317 --> 00:31:30,598
two

522
00:31:30,797 --> 00:31:31,077
one

523
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:32,358
Rush and rush.

524
00:31:35,517 --> 00:31:38,477
pretty

525
00:31:38,477 --> 00:31:40,757
Nice work.

526
00:31:40,757 --> 00:31:43,438
pretty

527
00:31:53,477 --> 00:31:57,678
Go Team China.

528
00:31:58,638 --> 00:32:00,198
Our Chinese Continuing Team

529
00:32:00,198 --> 00:32:01,997
Successfully won the match point.

530
00:32:03,997 --> 00:32:05,517
pretty

531
00:32:05,598 --> 00:32:08,237
Come on

532
00:32:09,037 --> 00:32:09,638
I can't.

533
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:10,598
The competition is too tense.

534
00:32:10,598 --> 00:32:12,077
I have to sit and watch.

535
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:13,237
By the way, Bai,

536
00:32:13,797 --> 00:32:15,118
I heard some explanation just now.

537
00:32:15,118 --> 00:32:16,678
I dug a hole for myself.

538
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:20,077
Sir

539
00:32:20,077 --> 00:32:22,198
Go home and drink your toilet water.

540
00:32:23,557 --> 00:32:24,237
No

541
00:32:24,797 --> 00:32:26,797
I think if we continue to fight like this,

542
00:32:27,118 --> 00:32:28,158
The third round is stable.

543
00:32:28,918 --> 00:32:31,077
The key is whether Xiao Bei can stand it.

544
00:32:31,678 --> 00:32:32,638
Xiao Feng will hire people.

545
00:32:32,638 --> 00:32:33,797
My hands are itchy.

546
00:32:35,678 --> 00:32:36,398
How about this?

547
00:32:37,438 --> 00:32:38,997
Wait a second, I'm done.

548
00:32:38,997 --> 00:32:40,277
Let's fight together.

549
00:32:41,598 --> 00:32:42,277
Old, old.

550
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:44,958
I'm quite old.

551
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,398
But we can still fight.

552
00:32:49,277 --> 00:32:49,997
can

553
00:32:50,438 --> 00:32:51,277
Continue to fight tenaciously.

554
00:32:51,277 --> 00:32:53,037
To tie the score one to one.

555
00:32:53,277 --> 00:32:54,598
In the third round,

556
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:57,638
Will determine who can advance to the finals.

557
00:32:57,638 --> 00:32:59,438
Who wants a ticket home?

558
00:33:04,838 --> 00:33:06,037
The next game is a new map.

559
00:33:06,037 --> 00:33:07,477
Both sides won't have the advantage.

560
00:33:07,477 --> 00:33:08,678
We still follow the old rules.

561
00:33:08,678 --> 00:33:09,398
Slow down.

562
00:33:11,878 --> 00:33:12,237
Xiaobei

563
00:33:12,678 --> 00:33:13,438
How is your hand?

564
00:33:15,918 --> 00:33:18,077
If you can't, let Xiangzi take over.

565
00:33:25,198 --> 00:33:26,398
Go on, team leader.

566
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:27,517
To treat the wounds of the players.

567
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:37,477
According to the regulations,

568
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:39,918
Enter the battle room after two rounds of rest.

569
00:33:40,077 --> 00:33:41,237
You can't have a relationship

570
00:33:41,237 --> 00:33:42,717
Any communication about the competition.

571
00:33:42,878 --> 00:33:43,237
good

572
00:34:27,477 --> 00:34:28,757
I believe in you.

573
00:34:28,757 --> 00:34:29,997
Will defeat them.

574
00:34:31,557 --> 00:34:32,237
Come on

575
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:51,638
fast

576
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:53,477
Record the video, I'll take the photo.

577
00:35:28,797 --> 00:35:29,198
come

578
00:35:29,198 --> 00:35:29,838
Come on

579
00:35:30,198 --> 00:35:31,158
Come on.

580
00:35:31,638 --> 00:35:31,797
come

581
00:35:32,678 --> 00:35:33,358
Come on.

582
00:35:38,598 --> 00:35:39,517
That

583
00:35:39,517 --> 00:35:40,477
this

584
00:35:41,037 --> 00:35:42,358
It's popular now.

585
00:35:42,477 --> 00:35:43,717
There are more than 10,000 people at the scene.

586
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:45,118
Millions of people on the Internet

587
00:35:45,398 --> 00:35:47,237
Are all your witnesses.

588
00:35:48,118 --> 00:35:49,358
Are all your witnesses.

589
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:49,757
That's right.

590
00:35:49,757 --> 00:35:50,838
The third round.

591
00:35:51,638 --> 00:35:52,398
Watch the game.

592
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:55,598
After a romantic episode,

593
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:56,958
To determine the fate of both sides.

594
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:58,317
The third game has started.

595
00:36:01,678 --> 00:36:03,958
This map is a brand new competition map.

596
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:04,958
Abandoned factory

597
00:36:05,157 --> 00:36:07,077
It's official for the Crossfire World Finals.

598
00:36:07,077 --> 00:36:08,758
The new map.

599
00:36:08,838 --> 00:36:09,958
We can see that

600
00:36:09,958 --> 00:36:11,677
It's not that big.

601
00:36:11,677 --> 00:36:13,157
But the terrain is quite complicated.

602
00:36:13,557 --> 00:36:15,318
There are many hiding places and dead ends.

603
00:36:15,637 --> 00:36:17,197
The Shelter Design of Different Heights

604
00:36:17,197 --> 00:36:19,077
Has brought great challenges to the players.

605
00:36:19,637 --> 00:36:21,278
And the narrow space

606
00:36:21,278 --> 00:36:23,477
Will test the player's ability to fire and react.

607
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:26,318
The game will start soon.

608
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,318
Who will be the winner?

609
00:36:29,677 --> 00:36:30,878
Will be announced soon.

610
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:34,878
pretty

611
00:36:34,878 --> 00:36:36,117
A hand mine on King's side.

612
00:36:36,117 --> 00:36:37,958
And blew up the half blood of Koro.

613
00:36:43,597 --> 00:36:45,077
Lu Xiao Bei killed one at the high point.

614
00:36:47,197 --> 00:36:47,878
Another one.

615
00:36:47,878 --> 00:36:49,278
And got a double.

616
00:36:49,477 --> 00:36:51,958
The team is strong.

617
00:36:55,517 --> 00:36:57,157
Their cooperation is so smooth.

618
00:37:06,197 --> 00:37:07,318
I feel that if we continue to fight,

619
00:37:07,318 --> 00:37:09,438
Has become more comfortable with the new map.

620
00:37:14,677 --> 00:37:15,878
On the contrary, TNT

621
00:37:18,718 --> 00:37:19,438
The feel of the machine.

622
00:37:19,438 --> 00:37:20,597
It's getting cold.

623
00:37:36,077 --> 00:37:37,918
Okay, Lu Xiao Bei is in the middle corridor.

624
00:37:37,918 --> 00:37:39,197
And stole the machine.

625
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:52,438
S + 1, come and get it.

626
00:37:52,997 --> 00:37:54,318
The defenders began to return to the defense.

627
00:37:55,597 --> 00:37:56,398
pretty

628
00:37:56,637 --> 00:37:57,958
Wang Kai came to fill the position.

629
00:37:57,958 --> 00:37:59,358
And took Nino.

630
00:38:10,477 --> 00:38:11,758
pretty

631
00:38:11,758 --> 00:38:12,438
Goodjob

632
00:38:12,878 --> 00:38:13,238
pretty

633
00:38:17,597 --> 00:38:19,157
Xiao Bei, try harder.

634
00:38:19,557 --> 00:38:21,477
The retreating turtle must be suffering.

635
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:22,557
He's a sore loser.

636
00:38:22,918 --> 00:38:24,037
If he doesn't come out,

637
00:38:24,918 --> 00:38:26,197
We have to admit defeat.

638
00:39:04,117 --> 00:39:06,037
Oh, my god, Machine has an AK.

639
00:39:06,037 --> 00:39:07,878
This is the first time I've ever

640
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:08,958
I saw him using an AK

641
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,677
This also represents TNT's tactics.

642
00:39:11,677 --> 00:39:13,318
Will change accordingly.

643
00:39:18,318 --> 00:39:20,117
Machine, this AK is very smooth.

644
00:39:20,117 --> 00:39:21,517
I guess I didn't waste much effort.

645
00:39:21,517 --> 00:39:22,718
The shooting feel is gone.

646
00:39:22,718 --> 00:39:24,197
Switch to AK and attack.

647
00:39:24,197 --> 00:39:25,918
It seems that this is left in advance.

648
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:51,997
We can see that

649
00:39:51,997 --> 00:39:53,838
Go on. There's only North left in the team.

650
00:39:55,758 --> 00:39:56,117
not good

651
00:39:56,117 --> 00:39:57,557
Machine knows where North is.

652
00:40:01,997 --> 00:40:03,557
Machine, take North straight away.

653
00:40:04,157 --> 00:40:05,398
After Machine replaced AK,

654
00:40:05,758 --> 00:40:07,477
To open the invincible mode again.

655
00:40:10,918 --> 00:40:11,997
The other side hasn't detected the poison yet.

656
00:40:11,997 --> 00:40:12,997
They want to grab early.

657
00:40:12,997 --> 00:40:14,477
We're in the process of their rush.

658
00:40:14,477 --> 00:40:14,997
Steal them.

659
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:15,878
King

660
00:40:15,878 --> 00:40:17,517
Switch to double shooting.

661
00:40:20,997 --> 00:40:21,477
go

662
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:37,117
You finally showed up.

663
00:41:37,597 --> 00:41:38,517
Xu Wei.

664
00:41:41,318 --> 00:41:42,358
For so many years,

665
00:41:42,597 --> 00:41:43,838
You still can't lose.

666
00:41:46,677 --> 00:41:48,157
You will lose.

667
00:41:48,157 --> 00:41:49,517
I'm here to win the championship.

668
00:41:49,517 --> 00:41:50,157
I told you.

669
00:41:51,238 --> 00:41:52,037
Some dreams.

670
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:53,278
Don't do it.
