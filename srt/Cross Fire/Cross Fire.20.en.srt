1
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,504
What's wrong with this injury?

2
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,262
Nothing

3
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:56,992
It's fine.

4
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,191
I've recovered.

5
00:01:03,214 --> 00:01:04,151
The result of the penalty has come out.

6
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:05,111
The Inferno.

7
00:01:05,271 --> 00:01:07,071
A group of hungry ghosts fight for a bite.

8
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:13,631
We have four games left.

9
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:15,427
We have to win the remaining four opponents.

10
00:01:15,427 --> 00:01:16,818
Including the Tiger Team.

11
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:17,871
Who are you?

12
00:01:17,951 --> 00:01:19,111
Are you her boyfriend?

13
00:01:19,191 --> 00:01:19,951
This is her takeout.

14
00:01:20,022 --> 00:01:20,871
Looking forward to your good comments.

15
00:01:21,101 --> 00:01:22,031
Where are you? Who is he?

16
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:22,982
What? Who?

17
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:24,311
Wang Kai, go out.

18
00:01:25,097 --> 00:01:25,471
Jiayi

19
00:01:25,663 --> 00:01:26,551
I thought you would change.

20
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:27,791
But you're too disappointing.

21
00:01:29,453 --> 00:01:30,631
568 points.

22
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:31,751
Tell your parents.

23
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:33,031
What do you want to apply for?

24
00:01:33,111 --> 00:01:33,991
I want to continue to play e-sports.

25
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:38,311
There's a team in Tencent Esports Games.

26
00:01:38,591 --> 00:01:39,911
To sign a team as a substitute.

27
00:01:39,911 --> 00:01:41,709
What good will it do if we go there?

28
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:42,911
The good thing is,

29
00:01:43,031 --> 00:01:44,991
We can torture each other again.

30
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:47,431
Shenzhen, here we come.

31
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:48,391
Hello, President Guo.

32
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:49,151
I'm Lu Xiao Bei.

33
00:01:49,211 --> 00:01:50,111
Welcome to join us.

34
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:51,542
This is our southern monster.

35
00:01:51,542 --> 00:01:52,071
Hello.

36
00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:53,791
We are the new replacements.

37
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:55,151
Choose a picture to warm up.

38
00:01:55,258 --> 00:01:57,231
To see if you're strong enough to be a sparring partner.

39
00:01:59,511 --> 00:02:00,751
That's all.

40
00:02:01,174 --> 00:02:03,493
How could you say you almost crossed the line?

41
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,399
That's it.

42
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,360
The live account of Douyu has been opened for you.

43
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,079
You can go live now.

44
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,479
How to make money?

45
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,599
When others brush gifts for you,

46
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,759
You can share it.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,840
Teach me.

48
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,239
Put your phone here.

49
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,239
Turn on the beauty lamp.

50
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,560
Be pretty.

51
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:22,919
Then what?

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,799
live broadcast

53
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:26,360
speak

54
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,840
You can't attract fans if you don't open your mouth.

55
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,999
Not this mouth.

56
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:34,999
What are you talking about?

57
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:35,760
Go away

58
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,120
Hello, everyone.

59
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,679
Welcome to my studio.

60
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,520
today

61
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,599
I've been sitting in front of the computer all day.

62
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,279
The skin feels dry.

63
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:47,319
So I'm going to recommend

64
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:49,440
We must be magic weapons for e-sports girls.

65
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,239
This is it.

66
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,840
The whitening mask of Royal Mud Workshop.

67
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,800
My little sisters are using it.

68
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,279
If the baby who made the third place today

69
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,400
You can get such a small gift.

70
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:02,480
Do you know it?

71
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,400
Soft and hard.

72
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,719
Next is our anchor's routine.

73
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,320
Old Iron brush attention

74
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,639
Beauty brush gift

75
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,519
Welcome, everyone.

76
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:12,240
Share and follow.

77
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,719
Brush your gifts.

78
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:20,639
You are short of money recently.

79
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:24,159
Our team is in charge of food and accommodation.

80
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:25,320
Where is your money?

81
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,240
Nezha, protection deity

82
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:36,120
There are many bad guys in the world.

83
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,560
Don't let anyone fool you.

84
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:40,079
I won't.

85
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,999
Give it to me.

86
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:47,719
Don't come.

87
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:48,480
Give it to me.

88
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:49,680
fast

89
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,279
Don't move.

90
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:51,320
Give it to me.

91
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,240
Let me ask you something.

92
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,279
Who is Qing Xue?

93
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,639
girlfriend

94
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,680
Is she...

95
00:03:58,919 --> 00:03:59,680
I often ask you to borrow money.

96
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:00,960
Have you met?

97
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,799
no

98
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:03,079
You transferred a lot of money to her.

99
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,760
He must be a liar.

100
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:05,359
You know what?

101
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:05,999
Don't bother.

102
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,199
You're out of your mind.

103
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,360
The scammers on WeChat,

104
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,879
I can add eight a day.

105
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,439
He has the same data as us.

106
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,680
Why is he in front of us?

107
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:25,560
Come on.

108
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,520
Get out of the way.

109
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,159
That's the Tiger Team.

110
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,640
Who's that little beard?

111
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:33,999
The captain of the Tiger Team.

112
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:34,599
So fierce.

113
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,719
Older than Lao Sha.

114
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,640
He is indeed one of the contestants

115
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,560
The older one.

116
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,159
But his marksmanship is in the Northeast Division.

117
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:41,999
And the most famous.

118
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,599
He hasn't met me yet.

119
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:54,199
congratulations

120
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:55,999
You played well last time.

121
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:56,840
Thank you

122
00:04:57,599 --> 00:04:58,360
Go for it.

123
00:04:58,719 --> 00:04:59,360
For tomorrow.

124
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,599
Don't lose too badly.

125
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,999
We're also working hard.

126
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,560
To make you cry and go home.

127
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,360
You're crazy.

128
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,159
How dare we?

129
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,080
We also want to keep a low profile.

130
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:16,879
but

131
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:17,999
This power

132
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,479
Not allowed.

133
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,719
Waiting for tomorrow.

134
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,800
You two go to the A bag.

135
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,360
I'll cover you.

136
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,039
Received

137
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:40,879
What's your situation?

138
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:43,879
Xiaobei

139
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,360
Look.

140
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,400
Xiaobei

141
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,159
Xiaobei

142
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,240
Xiao Bei, look.

143
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,039
Xiao Bei, look.

144
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,240
Xiaobei

145
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,479
Xiaobei

146
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,680
You're acting like this.

147
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,759
How dare you call him a sparring partner?

148
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,600
You can change your name to Accompany.

149
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,560
Brother

150
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,720
Our machine is as slow as a turtle.

151
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,120
otherwise

152
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,600
How about you try this turtle?

153
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,639
You're making excuses.

154
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:38,800
Kill Matt.

155
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,160
Aren't you known as AK Little Prince?

156
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,920
It's called AK girls.

157
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,280
Nezha, protection deity

158
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:45,240
let it be

159
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,600
I don't care about them.

160
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:45,999
Zha

161
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,480
Come on.

162
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,519
If you dare, let's play another round.

163
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,360
How dare you?

164
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,319
To waste time with you.

165
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,680
I'd better go back and get some sleep.

166
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,680
Go back to sleep.

167
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:58,240
Xiaobei

168
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,040
This broken machine can't be played.

169
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Within two minutes, all kinds of cards started.

170
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,319
What about Xiao Bei?

171
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,240
I came up with a story.

172
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,439
You are so thoughtful.

173
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,720
When do you still want a story?

174
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,680
Sky Li Xiaofeng

175
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,519
You know what?

176
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,319
Of course I know.

177
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,480
Human Emperor of Warcraft.

178
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,439
China's e-sports is the first.

179
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:16,560
Yes

180
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,480
At that time, he played interplanetary.

181
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,839
The computer configuration at home is poor.

182
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,040
Once the population exceeds 100,

183
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,280
The computer will be...

184
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,920
So he can only choose the opening fast break.

185
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,680
This is where Sky streaming comes in.

186
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:28,199
What are you saying?

187
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,160
Let's start a fast attack.

188
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,160
You can try.

189
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,240
I was thinking

190
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:34,999
We've been here for so many days.

191
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,680
Why do you always lose to the main force?

192
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,120
Not only because of the poor computers,

193
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,920
Because of the tactical coordination,

194
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,759
We are indeed inferior to them.

195
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:45,120
There are so many kinds of tactics.

196
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,680
It's because our guns aren't strong enough.

197
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,240
I don't think our marksmanship is worse than theirs.

198
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,680
Just like that game.

199
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,560
Someone is pretending to be in the middle.

200
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,040
Attracted your attention.

201
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,959
Then Liu Xu will lead

202
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,480
To steal from us.

203
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,439
I've read the report.

204
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,879
Li Xiaofeng not only practices his skills and speed,

205
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,280
He also read Sun Tzu's Art of War.

206
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,319
The reason why he

207
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,680
World Esports Championship Double

208
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,319
Based on his flexible tactics.

209
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,160
And execution.

210
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,800
I know what you mean.

211
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,439
But with only a few of us,

212
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,199
Stay here.

213
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,560
Find a way.

214
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,680
It's too hard.

215
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,759
We can be disciples.

216
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,720
Where can I find a teacher?

217
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,879
There are so many top professional teams in the world.

218
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,480
Hundreds of competitions every year.

219
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,480
I see.

220
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:27,839
Is this the way in martial arts novels?

221
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,600
To put all the major schools under the box,

222
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,480
I learned everything.

223
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,480
high

224
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,399
Is really high.

225
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,759
We are replacements now.

226
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,680
I have plenty of time to study tactics.

227
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,519
And the tactics in actual combat

228
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,360
Is the best teacher.

229
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,360
It smells good.

230
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,879
Can you hurry up?

231
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:47,120
You'll be ripe soon.

232
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,600
Don't worry!

233
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:53,439
The power is off.

234
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,079
What happened

235
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,439
Give me the lighter.

236
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,439
I guess it's a trip.

237
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,480
You eat first.

238
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,680
I'll show you outside.

239
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:05,199
He's here.

240
00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:06,759
It's okay. Sleep.

241
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,480
All right, let's eat.

242
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:10,160
Who's using it? The heat is fast.

243
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,280
Who is it?

244
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,199
Everyone, come out.

245
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,560
The boss is crazy again.

246
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,240
Should be almost there.

247
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:15,839
The boss is here to check.

248
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:16,600
Take it.

249
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,199
collect

250
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:17,920
Alright.

251
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,560
Take it.

252
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,319
I

253
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:20,680
What did I say?

254
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,480
Don't panic.

255
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,319
Pot, pot and pot.

256
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:24,280
I'll do it.

257
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
Pot, pot and pot.

258
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,160
Boss, what's wrong with you?

259
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,199
I smelled it.

260
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,480
Whose is it? Take it.

261
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,720
Are you using it?

262
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,120
We are useless.

263
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,999
Are you using it?

264
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:50,399
It's useless.

265
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,199
You live here too?

266
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,079
You also use this.

267
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:26,439
It's quite powerful.

268
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:28,160
Why are you always tripping?

269
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:31,160
What are you talking about?

270
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,119
You used the same one.

271
00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:35,199
The same size and the same power.

272
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,160
Was it bought at the canteen downstairs for 16 yuan?

273
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:41,160
I bought it at 12.

274
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,160
Are you using Heat Fast?

275
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:49,839
The smell of hot pot seasoning is all over the corridor.

276
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:54,280
Once again,

277
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,560
Anyone

278
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,719
Don't use it again. The heat is fast.

279
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,040
Tripping every day.

280
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:04,040
It's not too late to admit it.

281
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,319
If I catch it,

282
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:08,680
200 yuan.

283
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:31,280
Save water.

284
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:03,280
come

285
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,239
Drink up.

286
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,439
penetrating

287
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,520
Lower your voice.

288
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:08,959
good

289
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:09,599
Here, eat it while it's hot.

290
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,319
Hurry up.

291
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,079
come

292
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:12,000
It's all yours, everyone.

293
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:14,000
You sound so loud.

294
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:18,000
Come on.

295
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:19,839
Do it yourself.

296
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,400
It smells good.

297
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,520
Eat more.

298
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,199
I'm eating.

299
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,239
Try it.

300
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:26,439
It smells good.

301
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:27,239
Come on, brother.

302
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:27,760
Try it.

303
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:28,680
eat

304
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:29,959
Drink less.

305
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:30,760
I'll clip it for you.

306
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:32,839
come

307
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,319
We haven't introduced ourselves yet.

308
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:40,640
Xiao Feng, the maple leaf.

309
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,119
Chen Hu, Tiger Tiger.

310
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:45,359
You're a tiger.

311
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:46,319
The voice is bigger than the Kirin.

312
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,199
I'm telling you,

313
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:49,959
It's not easy for us to come back to Shenzhen.

314
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:50,839
Brothers,

315
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:51,119
Brother, brother.

316
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:52,119
Fell out with the family.

317
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:53,719
Without a change of clothes.

318
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:54,400
During the day.

319
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,359
Wear it at night, wash it, wear it during the day.

320
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:56,599
That's it.

321
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:57,920
It's not easy.

322
00:12:58,439 --> 00:12:59,920
We're not that strong.

323
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,560
It depends on this chance.

324
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,000
You treat every game as a final.

325
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,439
then

326
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:07,640
There's no turning back.

327
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,800
There's a way out, right?

328
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:09,680
high

329
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:11,319
Brother

330
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,400
Don't flatter each other.

331
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:16,760
Can go to the Hell Tournament.

332
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,319
No one is good.

333
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:21,040
come

334
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,640
No matter what tomorrow,

335
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:24,719
Whether the competition is dead or alive,

336
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:25,920
To be together tonight,

337
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,920
We are all brothers.

338
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,400
Cheers.

339
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:28,959
Come on.

340
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,079
Cheers!

341
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:34,160
Let's take photos.

342
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:34,880
Come on.

343
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,880
Take good posture.

344
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:39,319
He's here.

345
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:42,640
Three, two.

346
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:44,520
The Coin Team.

347
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:49,000
You drank too much.

348
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,640
It's okay.

349
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,439
sit

350
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:51,719
It's okay.

351
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:52,599
one

352
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,119
what

353
00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:53,560
it doesn't matter

354
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,239
How many drinks have you had?

355
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:56,239
What?

356
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,239
You're almost there. I'm telling you.

357
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,239
Why are you drinking like this?

358
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:02,040
Xiao Feng Xuan is the same.

359
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,439
one

360
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:04,160
A swirl.

361
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,920
Captain, let's have a look.

362
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:14,280
A swirl.

363
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:14,880
whirlpool

364
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,520
You Xuan.

365
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,479
A swirl.

366
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,680
I'll accompany

367
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,359
Can I...

368
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:33,119
The Kirin is not only loud,

369
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:34,000
You can drink.

370
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,599
Don't you want to have a spin? Come on.

371
00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:37,479
The swirl is over.

372
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:38,239
We have to finish it.

373
00:14:38,239 --> 00:14:38,719
whirlpool

374
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:39,439
That's right.

375
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,439
Drink it.

376
00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:43,239
Come on

377
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,680
Birthday girl, please.

378
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:49,760
You have conscience.

379
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,160
Remember today is my birthday.

380
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:51,880
I must.

381
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:57,839
The cake is here.

382
00:14:58,479 --> 00:15:00,400
The cake delivery people are wearing this.

383
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:01,599
So handsome.

384
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,160
Who ordered the flowers?

385
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,920
Are these flowers from the cake?

386
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,959
The service is so good now.

387
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:10,439
Happy birthday

388
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:13,439
How can you come back if you don't celebrate the Spring Festival?

389
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,719
I just want to see you.

390
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:15,920
Your birthday used to be

391
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,359
Is the most important festival of the year.

392
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:17,880
You always talk about the past.

393
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,599
Who is this?

394
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:19,599
Everyone will be embarrassed.

395
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:20,959
You know it with your knees.

396
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,319
Boyfriend, this is...

397
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:24,040
I know a lot of things happened between us.

398
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:25,359
A lot of misunderstandings.

399
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:28,000
Long legs are so cool.

400
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,359
Since we broke up,

401
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:30,079
You are shameless.

402
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:30,839
Don't you have them all?

403
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:31,599
You even came here.

404
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,880
We've been together for four years. Look at this.

405
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,680
To get back together.

406
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,000
It's not easy to tell the difference.

407
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,560
Then you can decide unilaterally.

408
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,800
To give up e-sports.

409
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,400
Decided to let me go to England with you.

410
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:41,319
I just hope

411
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:42,800
We have more time together.

412
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,959
Not like this.

413
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:45,040
One is here.

414
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:46,760
One is on the other side of the world.

415
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,640
If Su Jiayi takes the flower,

416
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:49,560
Kaikai

417
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,079
You will lose your chance.

418
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,079
The previous practice

419
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,319
I was too selfish.

420
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:58,359
Because I love you.

421
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,439
So I want to have all of you.

422
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:02,520
But now I realize that

423
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,359
I prefer the old you.

424
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,400
Look.

425
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,560
to pester

426
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,479
The ugly one is stubborn.

427
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,119
Handsome is affectionate.

428
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:15,680
Who can stand it?

429
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:16,959
Xiaobei

430
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,040
Who are you with?

431
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,479
I must be on your side.

432
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:21,359
Brother Kai, think about it.

433
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:22,160
Can't stand it.

434
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:23,319
And I heard that

435
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:24,280
This Steve

436
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,040
His family is in finance.

437
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:27,680
The swimming pool at home.

438
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,760
Is bigger than our club.

439
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:43,359
It's too big.

440
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:44,400
This young man

441
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,040
Is this a proposal or a proposal?

442
00:16:46,599 --> 00:16:47,439
Are similar in nature.

443
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,160
It depends on whether Su Jiayi will accept this.

444
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:50,800
Who did this?

445
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,479
Why do you have to get down on one knee to propose?

446
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,439
How about your knees?

447
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:55,839
Don't you have your knees together?

448
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,040
Is it a bet?

449
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,599
I bet 100.

450
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,560
Su Jiayi, please.

451
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:01,239
good

452
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,199
What did you say

453
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:05,719
I support you.

454
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,079
I bet Su Jiayi won't answer it.

455
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,160
good

456
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,520
I'll bet 50.

457
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,000
Brother Kai and

458
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:13,359
Your father and I

459
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,199
Brother Zha, what about you?

460
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:16,959
Five yuan.

461
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:17,599
No

462
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,239
Two pieces.

463
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:19,959
good

464
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:20,880
Then I...

465
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,040
I bet 200.

466
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,800
meet

467
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,479
you

468
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:24,839
see

469
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,719
Don't answer it.

470
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,239
Don't answer it.

471
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,000
Took it.

472
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:43,959
pretty

473
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:44,839
Hurry, transfer the money.

474
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:45,160
Hurry up.

475
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,439
And cake.

476
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,520
Nezha, hurry up.

477
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,760
Two yuan.

478
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:53,719
fifty

479
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,520
In my opinion,

480
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,040
We'll have dinner together tonight.

481
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,640
Get ready, Kai.

482
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,479
They're

483
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,160
And booked me a place to eat.

484
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,920
Go with me.

485
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:03,920
good

486
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,599
Come and eat.

487
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,560
Little brother.

488
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,199
I've learned how to pull a punch recently. Practice with me.

489
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,520
Fifteen, twenty.

490
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,239
fifteen

491
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:29,319
You're lucky.

492
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:30,439
One more.

493
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:37,439
Happy birthday

494
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,160
Steve, right?

495
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:45,520
Yes, I have.

496
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,520
Library

497
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,760
WangKai

498
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,439
It's too late.

499
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:52,239
Three cups.

500
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,040
Continue

501
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,079
come

502
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:04,359
Fifteen, twenty, fifteen.

503
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:07,599
Fifteen, twenty, fifty.

504
00:19:24,879 --> 00:19:26,000
That's all for today.

505
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,319
I have to train tomorrow.

506
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:28,000
Let's go.

507
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:29,240
Jiayi

508
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,760
You haven't made a wish yet.

509
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:33,919
good

510
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,240
Make a wish

511
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,879
Blow the candles.

512
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:42,599
Give it to me.

513
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:43,240
It's okay. I'll do it.

514
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,119
I'll do it.

515
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:44,760
Give it to me.

516
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,560
I'll do it.

517
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,240
Give it to me.

518
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,119
I'll take care of it.

519
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:47,800
I said I'll do it.

520
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,760
let go

521
00:19:53,879 --> 00:19:54,599
Happy birthday

522
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,879
The wish is made.

523
00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:00,560
You can leave now.

524
00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:03,520
a row

525
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:05,560
I'll wait for you downstairs.

526
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,839
No

527
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,520
I didn't mean that.

528
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,839
I wish you a safe journey.

529
00:20:17,879 --> 00:20:18,520
Jiayi

530
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,520
What do you mean?

531
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,119
You've seen it.

532
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:25,240
I just want to focus on the game.

533
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,399
I don't want to lie to you.

534
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:28,720
I can only listen to the sound of the keyboard and mouse.

535
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,000
To sleep at ease.

536
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:31,720
Only when I am with them,

537
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,399
Eating hot pot and barbecue.

538
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,679
Drinking beer and blowing cattle.

539
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,919
So I felt the food was in my stomach.

540
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,200
This is who I am.

541
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:42,599
The real Su Jiayi.

542
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,280
sorry

543
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,839
I disappointed you.

544
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,720
I think you're strange.

545
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,040
strange

546
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,639
I also think

547
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:57,040
But do you know why?

548
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,000
Because all the time,

549
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,119
I'm trying to be

550
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:03,879
The Su Jiayi you want,

551
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,760
I tried so hard to forget who I really am.

552
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,879
What is it like?

553
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,319
I don't want to be a bad person.

554
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:13,679
But I really don't want to lie to you.

555
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,480
Leave me.

556
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:17,960
Please.

557
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:20,440
Okay?

558
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:50,560
When the Blue Fish Team disbanded,

559
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:53,760
How many teams have I been on?

560
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:57,879
A dozen.

561
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,319
It's 17.

562
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,040
know

563
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,159
Among the 17 teams,

564
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:06,839
How many of them have played Hundred Cities?

565
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,520
None of them.

566
00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:13,000
why

567
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,720
Is it because I can't play well?

568
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,879
I used to think so too.

569
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,399
So I tried my best to run the map.

570
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:22,919
And trained hard.

571
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:24,440
To compete hard.

572
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,480
But I still can't win.

573
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,599
Because the real team

574
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:32,599
No one wants me.

575
00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:35,000
They want me.

576
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,679
Just to hit on me.

577
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,040
They want me to be their girlfriend.

578
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,639
Never treated me as a teammate.

579
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,000
Until Xiao Bei came to me.

580
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,280
I'm here.

581
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,760
Finally, a team is looking for me.

582
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,599
Not to get girls.

583
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,879
You're the best people

584
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:11,319
The best teammates.

585
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,079
I'm afraid of losing you.

586
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,760
I hope we can always

587
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,399
And fight happily.

588
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,599
Happy birthday to me.

589
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:19,599
Happy birthday

590
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:21,040
happy

591
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,480
Thank you for remembering my birthday.

592
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,079
that's right

593
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:39,560
I'm playing Matilda today.

594
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:41,839
What about

595
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:43,200
If you think it's pretty,

596
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,480
Brush the waves.

597
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,560
I'm playing her today.

598
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,839
Because I really envy her.

599
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,960
I admire her courage.

600
00:23:51,399 --> 00:23:52,000
treason

601
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,399
real

602
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:56,560
And to be yourself regardless of the world.

603
00:23:58,079 --> 00:23:58,800
today

604
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,960
I want to tell you a story.

605
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,480
Howl's moving castle.

606
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:06,079
Hull

607
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:08,159
Is a magician.

608
00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:11,200
He used his heart

609
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,399
And the demon Kasifa.

610
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,119
In exchange for a moveable castle.

611
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,240
Every day,

612
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,440
In different countries.

613
00:24:20,879 --> 00:24:22,639
With different identities.

614
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:25,000
It's like acting the role again and again.

615
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,159
No one knows.

616
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:32,639
What he really looks like.

617
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,560
His castle.

618
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,319
And never stopped.

619
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,280
His disguise

620
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,079
I just want to protect

621
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:46,560
You have no sense of security.

622
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,399
And vulnerable.

623
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,399
And what I want to protect

624
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,879
It's called

625
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:01,280
The ordinary girl of Su Jiayi.

626
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,960
Every day,

627
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,240
Are imitating Hal.

628
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,440
Act like someone else likes you.

629
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,319
To live like someone else.

630
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,319
satisfy

631
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:17,359
A sense of vanity and achievement.

632
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,040
Than what she lost.

633
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,359
Is much more important.

634
00:25:25,639 --> 00:25:26,639
You know,

635
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,879
What is the saddest time of her day?

636
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:35,119
When she met a group of people

637
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:38,319
When you love someone who knows you,

638
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:40,800
But I still dare not

639
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,480
Every moment that unfolds

640
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,159
Today is my 21st birthday.

641
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,480
I didn't use my heart.

642
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:50,960
I also got four.

643
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,919
That can drag my castle running.

644
00:26:01,879 --> 00:26:03,000
Little demons.

645
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,200
I'm Su Jiayi.

646
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,200
One is ordinary and inferior.

647
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,839
And unremarkable.

648
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,679
argumentative

649
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,520
A little bit.

650
00:26:13,879 --> 00:26:15,800
A bluffing coward.

651
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,280
From now on,

652
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:19,919
And decided to be myself.

653
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,240
Thank you to my Kasifars.

654
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:46,760
Thank you, Xiao Bei.

655
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,079
Thank you, Nezha.

656
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,200
Thank you, Cheng Hao.

657
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,599
Thank you, Wang Kai.

658
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,679
Thank you

659
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
Thank you

660
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:29,119
It seems that

661
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:31,599
Can only play one person.

662
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,040
She

663
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,040
Thank you.

664
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,720
My new look.

665
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:12,760
What about

666
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:13,919
good-looking

667
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:16,159
What you wear is Su Jiayi.

668
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,599
Wang Kai, comment on it.

669
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:21,839
It's good.

670
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,240
My first girlfriend.

671
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,919
Don't talk too much.

672
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:27,000
sister

673
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:27,839
It's so beautiful.

674
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,440
Let's go to training.

675
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:32,560
Teach them a lesson.

676
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:35,919
Are you all right?

677
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,839
When we passed the middle road,

678
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:38,240
You must search the Scriptures Pavilion.

679
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,359
After taking this place,

680
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,839
We can pass by the police path.

681
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:42,960
so

682
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,159
Nothing will happen to either side.

683
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:48,399
Double firepower points.

684
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,319
Little lady,

685
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:54,839
Today?

686
00:28:55,639 --> 00:28:56,159
come

687
00:28:56,679 --> 00:28:57,040
come

688
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,079
Nezha, go to the A bag.

689
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,200
Su Jiayi, go to A.

690
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:04,879
I'll kill them.

691
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:05,960
Received

692
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:18,960
pretty

693
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,560
Amazing

694
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,040
How is he?

695
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,599
Come on.

696
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,960
One more round.

697
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:27,639
come

698
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,599
Are they willing to A?

699
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:32,560
Su Jiayi and Nezha

700
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,399
You hold A.

701
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:33,919
Received

702
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,159
Good shot, Nezha.

703
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:50,280
Who is using the external hanger?

704
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:50,960
Stand up for yourself.

705
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,879
handsome young man

706
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,240
If you lose, you will lose.

707
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,800
And you framed us for cheating.

708
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,599
You can't be too

709
00:29:58,919 --> 00:29:59,919
Are you so naughty?

710
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,280
Three pistols.

711
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,480
How dare you say you didn't cheat?

712
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:04,520
Get out of the way

713
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,319
I want to check the computer.

714
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:06,079
Please, please.

715
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:09,720
Brother

716
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,440
If you think we've opened a plug-in,

717
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,280
We can play on a different computer.

718
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:15,440
Change it.

719
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:17,919
Don't scare them.

720
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,800
If we lose again,

721
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,639
Where to put their main force's face?

722
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,879
Are you still here?

723
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,440
Calm down. Don't get angry.

724
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,000
bye-bye

725
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,679
Come in and have a look. These are all registered by us.

726
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:52,359
the past few days

727
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,440
How long have you lived here?

728
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:56,359
Three days?

729
00:30:59,119 --> 00:30:59,639
you

730
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,079
stop

731
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,720
stop

732
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:14,280
Don't run.

733
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:37,720
run

734
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:39,200
Run!

735
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:48,200
Brother Police.

736
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,359
We are law-abiding young people.

737
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:52,760
We were drinking last night.

738
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,679
There's no trouble.

739
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:54,839
Did I ask you something?

740
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,240
You are the same.

741
00:31:57,639 --> 00:31:58,839
What are you running for?

742
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:02,879
he

743
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:05,119
He thought the owner called the police.

744
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,679
We just

745
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:09,079
It's a hot pot.

746
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:10,480
my God!

747
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,359
No wonder my electric meter runs hundreds of words.

748
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,280
you

749
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,639
You need to pay me.

750
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,399
You are so bold.

751
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,000
With this kind of non-product,

752
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
What if it causes a fire?

753
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,480
Namely

754
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:21,440
yes

755
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,679
We made a mistake.

756
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:24,560
We brought you trouble.

757
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,839
We must correct our mistakes.

758
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:26,599
I won't do it again.

759
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:35,480
What's wrong with you?

760
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,399
You really committed a crime.

761
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,359
You drank too much.

762
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,200
Take your ID.

763
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:41,879
come

764
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:42,440
I have my ID card.

765
00:33:09,879 --> 00:33:10,960
This is our last game.

766
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,919
You must win it.

767
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:12,760
Later, the Tiger Team

768
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,760
I'll definitely fight first.

769
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,599
They've changed our routine

770
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:15,319
I have found it out.

771
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:16,599
So this time we have to change the routine.

772
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:17,760
Lieutenant

773
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:19,399
You are the main attack.

774
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:20,520
Is there a problem?

775
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:26,679
Unicorn

776
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:27,399
in

777
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:28,079
The Kirin Shield.

778
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:29,000
I'm watching.

779
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,159
I threw it away.

780
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,159
Ming, you are doing me a favor.

781
00:33:36,879 --> 00:33:37,720
Hold still

782
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,200
Be steady.

783
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:38,720
you

784
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,399
stop

785
00:33:39,879 --> 00:33:40,359
Lieutenant

786
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:42,599
Lieutenant

787
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,399
take your time

788
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:50,399
I want to ask what the situation is.

789
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:51,599
Don't you want any free men?

790
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:52,079
Al-Amin

791
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:53,679
Xu Wei usually starts well.

792
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,319
Old sand.

793
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:55,800
I feel a little bit worse today.

794
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,879
Almost.

795
00:33:56,879 --> 00:33:58,159
A lot, okay?

796
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:58,879
Brother Feng, in front of you,

797
00:33:58,879 --> 00:33:59,560
I saw it.

798
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,359
Amazing

799
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,119
Take good care of them.

800
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,720
Send them home later.

801
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,480
Everyone A is small.

802
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,359
Ready to go.

803
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:15,639
Captain, Kirin, go to the center.

804
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,319
The others follow me.

805
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:17,240
Set out

806
00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:27,480
They are all in A.

807
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,159
Outflank him.

808
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:28,800
Received

809
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,000
Lieutenant

810
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,079
Amazing

811
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:10,599
What did I say?

812
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,679
You didn't bring your brain today.

813
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:15,599
You haven't brought your eyes.

814
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,839
Those shots can smell even worse.

815
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:17,960
The Kirin didn't kill Chen Hu.

816
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,839
So that I can block the shot.

817
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:20,040
You're making nonsense about others.

818
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,359
I'll hit you.

819
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:20,800
Don't disturb the Kirin.

820
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,319
You're

821
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,000
Unicorn

822
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,359
Lieutenant

823
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,000
Switch to a monkey.

824
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,240
If you change me,

825
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,119
Are you kidding me?

826
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:29,399
You're not yourself today.

827
00:35:29,399 --> 00:35:30,480
I just played two rounds.

828
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,520
I can see the problem.

829
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,639
Chen Hu can definitely see it.

830
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:34,159
They will definitely use you as a weapon

831
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,599
Substitution

832
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:36,720
Substitution

833
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:38,839
We need a replacement.

834
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:40,599
monkey

835
00:35:40,879 --> 00:35:41,079
on

836
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:41,919
I

837
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,359
He's the captain. He will decide the game.

838
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,399
Go. Come on.

839
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,079
Come on

840
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,079
Who did they replace?

841
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:53,079
That's a monkey.

842
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,159
monkey

843
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:54,720
No

844
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,119
Have any of you seen his video?

845
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:57,280
Chen Hu is not familiar with you.

846
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,639
I'll check the bottom first.

847
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:00,720
You are so obscene.

848
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,639
Don't shoot.

849
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,000
I'm relieved to hear you say that.

850
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,399
What I'm good at is stealing.

851
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:06,759
Come on

852
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,639
Nothing

853
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,320
He's a substitute.

854
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,599
I'm sure it's not Xu Weiqiang.

855
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,279
Stay behind.

856
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,719
She's here.

857
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:26,639
Nothing

858
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,239
Don't worry. It's in my hands.

859
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:33,360
hit

860
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,040
pretty

861
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:46,799
No, why did you drop it again?

862
00:36:46,799 --> 00:36:48,360
Can't you see someone?

863
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,920
What's the game? Go home and work.

864
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,840
Calm down.

865
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,279
In this round, you're going to the middle.

866
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:58,719
It's okay to give the head.

867
00:36:58,719 --> 00:36:59,520
I'll fix it for you in the back.

868
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:36,960
Go around the back. I'll charge from here.

869
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,480
understand

870
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,320
punching

871
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:16,599
Hold still

872
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:17,599
Two, two.

873
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,520
What are you doing there?

874
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,119
There's one point left.

875
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,159
Hold still

876
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:23,000
Don't panic.

877
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,119
It's okay.

878
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:25,400
to move forwards

879
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:25,759
I'm on it.

880
00:38:25,759 --> 00:38:26,840
Move forward.

881
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,719
can

882
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,520
you bet, you pay

883
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:50,159
I call you Brother Yi Sheng.

884
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:54,119
Let's play the official match.

885
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,079
For us.

886
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,679
The brothers of Hell Team.

887
00:38:59,119 --> 00:38:59,880
To compete with you.

888
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:01,320
If you win the championship,

889
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,360
So I can go back and play.

890
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:04,679
And lose to the champion.

891
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,759
It's embarrassing.

892
00:39:06,799 --> 00:39:08,239
not to be crushed

893
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:10,440
I can win the national championship.

894
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:18,639
Come on

895
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:22,199
Lieutenant

896
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,719
Lieutenant

897
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,279
You're still mad at me?

898
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:27,279
No

899
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,920
With your mental state,

900
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,960
It's all on your face.

901
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,239
How dare I be angry with you?

902
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,560
What happened to your hand?

903
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:36,880
Nothing

904
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:38,079
Since you came in today,

905
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,040
I thought something was wrong with you.

906
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:40,639
Your hands are shaking like chaff.

907
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,799
You must have drunk too much last night.

908
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:44,679
Your hands are really good.

909
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,119
Your hands are fine, that's what you have in mind.

910
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:49,040
Don't lie to me.

911
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,799
My urn will be buried with you.

912
00:39:50,799 --> 00:39:52,320
We will be together for hundreds of years.

913
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:54,840
Stop guessing.

914
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,639
I'm really fine.

915
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,040
Do you like An Lan?

916
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:20,440
What's the big deal?

917
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:22,920
I also like An Lan.

918
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,520
Who doesn't like such a nice girl?

919
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,400
Otherwise, we're iron.

920
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:28,320
You like girls with different tastes.

921
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:30,520
yes

922
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,119
However

923
00:40:31,759 --> 00:40:32,920
It's useless for us to like each other.

924
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,719
It depends on what An Lan wants.

925
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,920
I'll make a statement.

926
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:38,719
No matter who An Lan chooses,

927
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:40,679
Can't affect our relationship.

928
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,639
This is

929
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,679
We have to compete fairly.

930
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,400
It's a deal

931
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:48,040
Who will compete with you?

932
00:40:59,279 --> 00:41:00,560
Why are you avoiding me?

933
00:41:03,279 --> 00:41:04,000
I didn't.

934
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:06,079
You look at me like a ghost.

935
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,079
Is that necessary?

936
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,520
You have such a thin skin.

937
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,599
Take them out.

938
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,320
We want to catch the thief.

939
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:16,920
what are you doing?

940
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:21,799
Who of you stole my wallet?

941
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:22,920
what?

942
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,040
Do you want me to search it myself?

943
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,279
What happened

944
00:41:26,279 --> 00:41:27,199
Are you pretending?

945
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,920
Do you have any evidence?

946
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,159
What are you doing here?

947
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:31,279
I left it in the training room.

948
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:32,799
Just a few of your replacements.

949
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,759
Did it grow wings and fly?

950
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,679
We didn't see any wallet.

951
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:37,440
Don't talk nonsense.

952
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,560
Don't you want to search?

953
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,159
a row

954
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:41,199
Call the police

955
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,239
Call the police.

956
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,360
Liu Xu can't reveal his family secrets.

957
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,119
When the police come, it's a criminal case.

958
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,920
Who cares how much money you have?

959
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,279
Who cares?

960
00:41:50,279 --> 00:41:51,880
Why are you guilty?

961
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,719
Don't you want to search?

962
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:53,560
search

963
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,719
Search it.

964
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:56,480
But what if I don't?

965
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:57,480
In front of President Guo,

966
00:41:57,639 --> 00:41:59,400
I'll give you an apology.

967
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,279
What if you search it?

968
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:04,279
I've searched it.

969
00:42:04,799 --> 00:42:05,799
Business is business

970
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:06,840
a row

971
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,560
Listen to you.

972
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,799
Search it.

973
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,000
what are you doing?

974
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,000
WangKai

975
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,360
Let him search.

976
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,480
You can lay it out for me later.

977
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,079
I'm telling you,

978
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,440
Don't search.

979
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:24,320
What is this?

980
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:30,000
1,500 yuan.

981
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:30,880
to be dead

982
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:32,480
If I find it later,

983
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,599
Did you lose your wallet as well?

984
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:36,840
Whose bed is this?

985
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:38,920
My

986
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:41,159
How dare you admit it?

987
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,159
I didn't steal it.

988
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:42,960
You didn't steal it.

989
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,480
It ran into your bed.

990
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,400
You still don't recognize him.

991
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:46,400
President Guo.

992
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,480
I have to call the police today.

993
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,360
It's not me.

994
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,199
The wallet was on his bed. He didn't steal it.

995
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,119
Can you prove that he didn't steal it?

996
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,040
Isn't it 1500 yuan?

997
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:54,840
I'll give you 2,000 yuan.

998
00:42:55,279 --> 00:42:56,040
He stole it.

999
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,079
What are you paying for?

1000
00:42:57,079 --> 00:42:57,960
You're using your phone.

1001
00:42:58,239 --> 00:42:58,880
Bring it here.

1002
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,599
Give it to me.

1003
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:01,480
I didn't return it.

1004
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,119
Let go of him.

1005
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,199
What are you doing?

1006
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,239
other

1007
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:18,799
President Guo said

1008
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,639
Are my own people.

1009
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:20,040
Don't call the police.

1010
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:20,960
Are you not capable?

1011
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,799
You jump.

1012
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,040
Aren't you bold?

1013
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,759
jump

1014
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:24,520
Nezha, protection deity

1015
00:43:25,279 --> 00:43:26,079
Whether you stole it or not,

1016
00:43:26,279 --> 00:43:27,360
Don't do anything stupid.

1017
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:28,560
And got the stolen goods.

1018
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,679
What do you think?

1019
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:30,360
Nezha, protection deity

1020
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,440
Nezha, come back.

1021
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,520
It's dangerous.

1022
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,239
Nezha, protection deity

1023
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,320
You don't believe me.
