1
00:02:51,414 --> 00:02:51,974
Don't be late.

2
00:02:51,974 --> 00:02:53,414
Can't you see your cards are big?

3
00:02:53,535 --> 00:02:54,334
What is it?

4
00:02:55,974 --> 00:02:57,974
She's the Galaxy Battleship of the League.

5
00:02:58,175 --> 00:02:58,775
The Galactic Battleship.

6
00:02:58,775 --> 00:02:59,654
I'm returning the plane.

7
00:03:22,615 --> 00:03:22,974
Hello, everyone.

8
00:03:22,974 --> 00:03:24,815
All the teams and fans

9
00:03:24,815 --> 00:03:25,454
Hello, everyone.

10
00:03:25,654 --> 00:03:26,815
This is 2020.

11
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:28,414
Crossfire Pro League Playoff

12
00:03:28,414 --> 00:03:30,054
At the press conference.

13
00:03:30,054 --> 00:03:31,654
The current 16 teams

14
00:03:31,654 --> 00:03:33,895
After 45 days of fierce fighting,

15
00:03:33,895 --> 00:03:37,094
Six teams made it to the playoffs.

16
00:03:37,295 --> 00:03:38,374
They are

17
00:03:38,374 --> 00:03:40,535
The defending champion who won the championship two years in a row.

18
00:03:40,535 --> 00:03:42,255
Gravitational Team.

19
00:03:45,734 --> 00:03:47,374
ING Team.

20
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:49,014
Hey, Squad.

21
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,094
DUKE Team

22
00:03:52,495 --> 00:03:54,014
Team 8848.

23
00:03:54,454 --> 00:03:56,855
And continue the team.

24
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:01,935
Then in the next time,

25
00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:04,055
The six teams will continue to fight.

26
00:04:04,055 --> 00:04:05,374
In the playoffs,

27
00:04:05,374 --> 00:04:07,534
To compete for the championship this year.

28
00:04:07,654 --> 00:04:08,855
Yes, so now,

29
00:04:08,855 --> 00:04:09,614
Or the microphone?

30
00:04:09,614 --> 00:04:11,254
Give it to the leading actors of today.

31
00:04:11,254 --> 00:04:12,374
Invite them to talk.

32
00:04:12,374 --> 00:04:14,495
For the playoffs this year.

33
00:04:14,614 --> 00:04:15,975
First, let's give it up.

34
00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:17,775
The general manager of Gravity Club.

35
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:19,975
Mr. Xu Wei and his team members

36
00:04:19,975 --> 00:04:21,295
to ask sb in

37
00:04:28,654 --> 00:04:30,135
Crossing Fire Professional League to this year.

38
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:31,695
Is already the 12th.

39
00:04:31,695 --> 00:04:33,894
The Gravity Team has been fighting for 12 years.

40
00:04:33,894 --> 00:04:35,094
In these twelve years,

41
00:04:35,094 --> 00:04:37,055
Our goal has never changed.

42
00:04:37,454 --> 00:04:39,254
Is to put the best game

43
00:04:39,254 --> 00:04:40,495
To the players.

44
00:04:40,495 --> 00:04:42,614
Save the highest honor for yourself.

45
00:04:42,614 --> 00:04:43,014
President Xu.

46
00:04:43,014 --> 00:04:45,374
Are you confident of defending your title this year?

47
00:04:45,814 --> 00:04:47,654
I've told my players

48
00:04:47,975 --> 00:04:49,254
If you get the second place,

49
00:04:49,335 --> 00:04:50,575
Don't take the trophy back.

50
00:04:50,775 --> 00:04:52,014
Because in the honor cabinet of the club,

51
00:04:52,014 --> 00:04:53,135
There's really no place to put it.

52
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,695
After all,

53
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,255
You're looking at the result.

54
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:58,655
I heard that Gravity Club will launch the New Third Board.

55
00:04:58,655 --> 00:05:00,815
Is about to become the first in the e-sports industry.

56
00:05:01,014 --> 00:05:02,415
Is the news true?

57
00:05:02,415 --> 00:05:03,975
When we win the championship,

58
00:05:03,975 --> 00:05:05,214
To answer your question.

59
00:05:05,214 --> 00:05:06,695
Please take a rest.

60
00:05:06,695 --> 00:05:08,334
Next, let's give it up.

61
00:05:08,334 --> 00:05:09,375
ING Team.

62
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:09,975
It's my pleasure.

63
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:12,014
To compete with the other five outstanding teams

64
00:05:12,014 --> 00:05:13,014
In the playoffs.

65
00:05:13,014 --> 00:05:14,375
To make the playoff.

66
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,255
For us,

67
00:05:15,255 --> 00:05:17,095
Is actually a victory.

68
00:05:17,095 --> 00:05:18,334
No matter the result,

69
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:19,614
I will do my best.

70
00:05:19,614 --> 00:05:20,535
I hope we can

71
00:05:20,535 --> 00:05:21,894
Can play at their own level.

72
00:05:21,894 --> 00:05:22,975
Thanks to the DUKE team.

73
00:05:22,975 --> 00:05:24,014
Thank you, Hey Team.

74
00:05:24,014 --> 00:05:25,334
Thank you, Team 8848.

75
00:05:25,334 --> 00:05:27,054
At last, let's give a round of applause.

76
00:05:27,054 --> 00:05:28,375
The dark horse this year.

77
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,614
Go on.

78
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,174
to ask sb in

79
00:05:32,214 --> 00:05:34,014
As a newly promoted team,

80
00:05:34,014 --> 00:05:35,614
The team of Crossfire Professional League.

81
00:05:35,614 --> 00:05:37,975
Reached the playoffs in his first season.

82
00:05:37,975 --> 00:05:39,734
And we also know that

83
00:05:39,734 --> 00:05:41,135
In the eyes of many players,

84
00:05:41,135 --> 00:05:42,014
Has become

85
00:05:42,295 --> 00:05:43,855
Grass-roots hero

86
00:05:44,174 --> 00:05:46,454
There are many fans on the scene today.

87
00:05:46,454 --> 00:05:48,214
And the media want to know

88
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:49,255
What is it?

89
00:05:49,255 --> 00:05:51,454
And supported you to this day.

90
00:05:51,454 --> 00:05:52,655
And successfully won.

91
00:05:52,655 --> 00:05:54,934
One tough match after another.

92
00:05:55,575 --> 00:05:56,135
The competition

93
00:05:56,135 --> 00:05:57,095
For us,

94
00:05:57,095 --> 00:05:58,655
Only made it to the finals.

95
00:05:58,934 --> 00:06:00,535
You have to take the next step.

96
00:06:00,535 --> 00:06:02,575
The goal of this year's team is

97
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:03,815
Into the finals.

98
00:06:04,695 --> 00:06:05,095
No

99
00:06:05,454 --> 00:06:06,734
Our goal this year

100
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,375
Is the champion.

101
00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:23,695
You haven't slept yet.

102
00:06:25,454 --> 00:06:26,214
Congratulations.

103
00:06:26,535 --> 00:06:27,815
And return to the main position.

104
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:29,054
I've already said that.

105
00:06:29,054 --> 00:06:30,135
With your capabilities,

106
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:31,934
Even King will not be your opponent sooner or later.

107
00:06:32,614 --> 00:06:33,535
Do you know?

108
00:06:33,655 --> 00:06:35,774
Who arranged the team challenge?

109
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:36,774
club

110
00:06:37,334 --> 00:06:39,014
I went to report to Mr. Xu.

111
00:06:39,014 --> 00:06:40,135
He specially arranged it.

112
00:06:40,415 --> 00:06:41,655
To give you a chance.

113
00:06:41,655 --> 00:06:42,334
To prove myself.

114
00:06:42,454 --> 00:06:43,535
Thank President Xu for me.

115
00:06:43,894 --> 00:06:45,575
If you really want to thank Mr. Xu,

116
00:06:46,415 --> 00:06:47,415
You should show it.

117
00:06:48,494 --> 00:06:49,255
What do you mean?

118
00:06:50,174 --> 00:06:52,535
Mr. Xu has a mental illness for a long time.

119
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:55,174
Liang Bingjie is the cause of the problem.

120
00:06:55,174 --> 00:06:56,095
She used her seniority

121
00:06:56,095 --> 00:06:57,535
In the club.

122
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,695
Why are you telling me this?

123
00:06:58,695 --> 00:07:00,694
The last time Liang Bingjie went to a bar,

124
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:01,855
After she drank too much,

125
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:03,694
Said the club's accounts were messy.

126
00:07:04,335 --> 00:07:05,174
Is there such a thing?

127
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:06,535
I think so.

128
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:07,814
What's up

129
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,855
This is a serious violation of the rules.

130
00:07:10,415 --> 00:07:11,975
At the regular meeting next Monday,

131
00:07:11,975 --> 00:07:13,975
I want you to identify her.

132
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,095
What does it have to do with me?

133
00:07:16,215 --> 00:07:17,174
I don't want to get involved.

134
00:07:18,934 --> 00:07:21,574
President Xu spent a lot of money to train you.

135
00:07:21,934 --> 00:07:23,814
This is your chance to show your loyalty.

136
00:07:24,295 --> 00:07:25,895
I said I don't want to understand.

137
00:07:26,215 --> 00:07:27,254
May I remind you that

138
00:07:28,494 --> 00:07:30,215
Now if you're on the wrong side,

139
00:07:30,494 --> 00:07:31,934
You will regret it in the future.

140
00:07:32,374 --> 00:07:33,254
Is there anything else?

141
00:07:33,934 --> 00:07:34,895
It's okay. Let's go.

142
00:08:06,174 --> 00:08:07,655
Mr. Xu, are you looking for me?

143
00:08:09,535 --> 00:08:10,975
Stand up and say something.

144
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:12,535
Is it that hard?

145
00:08:14,934 --> 00:08:15,535
It's not difficult.

146
00:08:16,855 --> 00:08:18,215
But I don't want to get involved in the mess.

147
00:08:18,215 --> 00:08:19,734
I'll take you to gravity.

148
00:08:20,455 --> 00:08:23,254
Is to make you obey my command unconditionally.

149
00:08:23,535 --> 00:08:24,655
Whether it's a game,

150
00:08:24,655 --> 00:08:26,095
Or do something else?

151
00:08:28,934 --> 00:08:30,295
You mean I sold it to you?

152
00:08:32,215 --> 00:08:33,494
You should know who it is.

153
00:08:33,494 --> 00:08:34,814
Gave you everything I have now.

154
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:35,934
good

155
00:08:37,174 --> 00:08:38,095
Then I'll quit gravity.

156
00:08:38,095 --> 00:08:38,814
What did you say

157
00:08:38,814 --> 00:08:40,374
I said I quit gravity.

158
00:08:40,374 --> 00:08:41,614
My parents gave me my life.

159
00:08:41,975 --> 00:08:43,015
In my lifetime,

160
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:44,215
You can't be a dog for anyone.

161
00:08:49,975 --> 00:08:51,015
Have you thought it through?

162
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:53,254
I can make a man.

163
00:08:53,535 --> 00:08:54,814
Can be destroyed.

164
00:08:55,054 --> 00:08:56,494
You want the whole league to ban me?

165
00:08:57,494 --> 00:08:58,134
can

166
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,655
How about something creative?

167
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,734
You can do whatever you want.

168
00:09:03,535 --> 00:09:04,574
There are two crutches on the north side of the road.

169
00:09:04,574 --> 00:09:05,855
Can enter the Crossfire Professional League.

170
00:09:06,455 --> 00:09:07,535
What's so scary about me?

171
00:09:12,015 --> 00:09:13,295
Let's go, A.

172
00:09:13,655 --> 00:09:14,694
I'll watch the bridge.

173
00:09:14,694 --> 00:09:15,455
Platform A is down.

174
00:09:15,694 --> 00:09:16,574
Amazing

175
00:09:16,694 --> 00:09:17,215
It fell off.

176
00:09:17,215 --> 00:09:18,775
That's nice. Nice gun.

177
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:19,655
Lower bag.

178
00:09:19,655 --> 00:09:20,455
When I build the bridge,

179
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:22,374
Watch out for door B.

180
00:09:22,614 --> 00:09:23,215
A police officer.

181
00:09:23,215 --> 00:09:24,295
I will take the A dog.

182
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:26,374
Xiaobei

183
00:09:26,895 --> 00:09:28,054
Come and have a look.

184
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,215
A Great White.

185
00:09:37,694 --> 00:09:39,254
I can't survive in gravity.

186
00:09:41,335 --> 00:09:42,374
You're back.

187
00:09:45,934 --> 00:09:47,134
Give me another chance.

188
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:53,975
Can I have a word?

189
00:09:57,335 --> 00:09:58,254
Continue training.

190
00:10:10,054 --> 00:10:10,975
To attack quickly.

191
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:11,734
Two in the middle.

192
00:10:11,734 --> 00:10:12,215
Received

193
00:10:12,455 --> 00:10:13,295
To Grade A.

194
00:10:14,574 --> 00:10:15,494
The bridge fell.

195
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:19,494
Someone fell under the bridge.

196
00:10:19,694 --> 00:10:20,535
S + 1 subpackage

197
00:10:20,535 --> 00:10:21,374
Under the bridge,

198
00:10:21,374 --> 00:10:22,374
Sorry, I forgot.

199
00:10:26,975 --> 00:10:27,934
I dropped in A.

200
00:10:28,015 --> 00:10:29,054
it doesn't matter

201
00:10:29,134 --> 00:10:30,015
I'm winding it.

202
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,895
I'll seal the cigarette.

203
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:31,455
platform

204
00:10:31,455 --> 00:10:32,174
Platform A is down.

205
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:33,015
Seal the door and flash it.

206
00:10:33,374 --> 00:10:33,934
It fell off.

207
00:10:34,174 --> 00:10:34,814
Nice gun.

208
00:10:34,975 --> 00:10:35,415
pretty

209
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,054
That's all for today.

210
00:10:43,455 --> 00:10:44,455
Go back and rest.

211
00:11:03,215 --> 00:11:03,895
He's still here.

212
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,054
sorry

213
00:12:05,615 --> 00:12:06,454
I'm back

214
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:08,974
Back then,

215
00:12:09,255 --> 00:12:10,694
And let you live for free.

216
00:12:12,135 --> 00:12:13,574
Go back to your Vietnamese stir fry.

217
00:12:15,814 --> 00:12:16,735
sorry

218
00:12:21,934 --> 00:12:23,535
Can you give me another chance?

219
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,334
Or a substitute, or a busboy.

220
00:12:25,334 --> 00:12:26,334
As long as I can come back,

221
00:12:26,895 --> 00:12:28,174
I want to be a substitute.

222
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:29,295
No way.

223
00:12:34,174 --> 00:12:35,854
I'm too tired to play games.

224
00:12:36,574 --> 00:12:37,214
therefore

225
00:12:37,574 --> 00:12:39,094
To be a manager.

226
00:12:40,655 --> 00:12:41,854
You can take my class.

227
00:12:45,054 --> 00:12:46,135
Before I regret it,

228
00:12:46,135 --> 00:12:46,974
You still haven't returned to the team.

229
00:12:53,094 --> 00:12:53,655
Haozi

230
00:13:00,054 --> 00:13:00,854
Wait

231
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:02,495
Stand here.

232
00:13:03,295 --> 00:13:04,574
To be frank,

233
00:13:04,574 --> 00:13:06,415
If you jump to another team,

234
00:13:06,415 --> 00:13:08,255
I'm going to break both of your legs.

235
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,615
Anyway, Xiao Bei's wheelchair

236
00:13:11,135 --> 00:13:12,255
I'm free.

237
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:28,415
Pick it again.

238
00:13:29,214 --> 00:13:30,135
You will be dead.

239
00:13:46,334 --> 00:13:47,054
who

240
00:13:49,574 --> 00:13:50,214
I

241
00:13:52,574 --> 00:13:53,495
what?

242
00:13:57,415 --> 00:13:58,454
How are you doing lately

243
00:14:01,214 --> 00:14:01,934
Susu

244
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:05,854
sorry

245
00:14:06,334 --> 00:14:07,895
I know I did a lot of things wrong

246
00:14:09,174 --> 00:14:10,934
I shouldn't have left you and the team.

247
00:14:11,214 --> 00:14:12,415
I made a mistake.

248
00:14:13,255 --> 00:14:14,535
You won't care about it.

249
00:14:15,694 --> 00:14:17,135
Because I'm not afraid of anything.

250
00:14:17,895 --> 00:14:20,135
Even if I hit the southern wall, it's just a scar.

251
00:14:20,615 --> 00:14:21,895
But I was wrong this time.

252
00:14:22,415 --> 00:14:23,295
I'm scared.

253
00:14:24,574 --> 00:14:25,495
I know that leaving you

254
00:14:25,495 --> 00:14:26,775
A stupid decision.

255
00:14:30,015 --> 00:14:31,574
Can you give me another chance?

256
00:14:34,015 --> 00:14:34,895
I'm tired.

257
00:14:35,295 --> 00:14:36,415
You want to sleep?

258
00:14:43,334 --> 00:14:44,974
I will try to change myself.

259
00:14:46,574 --> 00:14:47,615
Trust me, okay?

260
00:14:48,295 --> 00:14:49,735
You don't have to change yourself.

261
00:14:51,255 --> 00:14:53,495
We don't have to change ourselves for anyone.

262
00:14:54,814 --> 00:14:55,615
WangKai

263
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:58,334
We used to be together.

264
00:14:58,735 --> 00:15:00,814
I was really happy a lot of the time.

265
00:15:01,094 --> 00:15:03,255
I'm so happy to have a fight.

266
00:15:04,214 --> 00:15:05,854
But something is broken.

267
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:07,054
Is broken.

268
00:15:07,535 --> 00:15:09,615
I'd rather remember it at its best.

269
00:15:10,454 --> 00:15:12,735
I don't want to stick the pieces together.

270
00:15:13,094 --> 00:15:15,094
And pretend to see the cracks.

271
00:15:16,255 --> 00:15:18,255
You lied to yourself and said it's okay.

272
00:15:23,535 --> 00:15:24,735
I have to train tomorrow.

273
00:15:25,974 --> 00:15:27,094
Go to bed early.

274
00:15:33,574 --> 00:15:34,334
good

275
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:00,054
Opponents are good at defending.

276
00:16:00,054 --> 00:16:01,214
So we dragged and fought.

277
00:16:01,214 --> 00:16:02,974
Hold it until Red Seconds.

278
00:16:02,974 --> 00:16:04,094
Xiangzi harassed me in the middle.

279
00:16:04,094 --> 00:16:05,375
The rest of you go to Package A.

280
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,214
Received

281
00:16:06,214 --> 00:16:07,054
Go, go up.

282
00:16:07,054 --> 00:16:08,295
Road A, the guns are white.

283
00:16:08,295 --> 00:16:09,174
It can be rushed.

284
00:16:09,174 --> 00:16:09,814
Get rid of one.

285
00:16:09,814 --> 00:16:10,415
pretty

286
00:16:10,415 --> 00:16:10,694
Nice gun.

287
00:16:10,694 --> 00:16:12,094
We'll handle it for you.

288
00:16:12,094 --> 00:16:12,694
The door is off.

289
00:16:12,694 --> 00:16:14,015
Hold on. Slowly.

290
00:16:14,454 --> 00:16:15,174
A The dog is gone.

291
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:15,735
Nice gun.

292
00:16:16,535 --> 00:16:18,214
pretty

293
00:16:18,214 --> 00:16:19,454
I'll take care of the last one in the middle.

294
00:16:19,454 --> 00:16:19,854
Received

295
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:27,094
They're charging B.

296
00:16:27,094 --> 00:16:28,255
Door B came out and one fell off.

297
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:29,255
Warehouse B

298
00:16:29,854 --> 00:16:30,854
101 Watch the highs.

299
00:16:30,854 --> 00:16:31,974
Push it to B.

300
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:32,415
Pack your bags.

301
00:16:35,934 --> 00:16:36,615
Behind the box,

302
00:16:37,574 --> 00:16:38,054
Amazing

303
00:16:38,054 --> 00:16:39,094
Congratulations, Team Gravity.

304
00:16:39,094 --> 00:16:40,655
As the first to enter this year.

305
00:16:40,655 --> 00:16:41,895
The team of the finals of Crossfire Professional League.

306
00:16:42,214 --> 00:16:43,454
The last two of them

307
00:16:43,454 --> 00:16:43,934
A is gone.

308
00:16:44,535 --> 00:16:45,694
And the last one.

309
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,135
After two rounds of one-on-one battle,

310
00:16:48,135 --> 00:16:49,775
Go on, Team and Team Gravity.

311
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,214
To advance to the finals.

312
00:16:51,214 --> 00:16:52,974
To attack the champion.

313
00:17:25,255 --> 00:17:25,735
Two, nine.

314
00:17:26,934 --> 00:17:27,574
Two, nine.

315
00:17:27,574 --> 00:17:28,375
Two more.

316
00:17:29,295 --> 00:17:30,094
Four nines.

317
00:17:38,135 --> 00:17:39,295
Four nines.

318
00:17:39,735 --> 00:17:40,615
I'll give you two more.

319
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:42,694
Six, nine.

320
00:17:46,135 --> 00:17:47,415
It's true this time.

321
00:17:47,854 --> 00:17:49,974
If I really take the card,

322
00:17:50,535 --> 00:17:51,495
It's true.

323
00:18:00,735 --> 00:18:02,454
Captain, is that you?

324
00:18:33,854 --> 00:18:34,735
You're back.

325
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:35,895
Brother

326
00:18:38,174 --> 00:18:38,694
Well

327
00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:43,334
It seems that we have succeeded.

328
00:18:49,775 --> 00:18:51,174
How are you feeling now?

329
00:18:52,295 --> 00:18:53,334
feel

330
00:18:54,974 --> 00:18:56,535
I slept for a long time.

331
00:18:59,255 --> 00:19:00,214
Where is this?

332
00:19:02,054 --> 00:19:03,615
This is the one I found for you.

333
00:19:04,495 --> 00:19:05,974
It's a safe place.

334
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:07,895
Get a cup of water.

335
00:19:12,495 --> 00:19:13,655
Now?

336
00:19:15,174 --> 00:19:16,495
What time is it?

337
00:19:17,974 --> 00:19:18,895
Now?

338
00:19:19,415 --> 00:19:21,015
It's 11: 02 pm.

339
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,334
Which year?

340
00:19:22,974 --> 00:19:24,094
In 2020,

341
00:19:24,615 --> 00:19:26,814
The 19th of November in the Gregorian calendar.

342
00:19:28,135 --> 00:19:28,895
You have...

343
00:19:29,655 --> 00:19:30,895
Lying on the bed.

344
00:19:30,895 --> 00:19:32,015
Eleven years ago.

345
00:19:42,655 --> 00:19:43,535
Old sand.

346
00:19:44,615 --> 00:19:45,735
Can you believe it?

347
00:19:48,574 --> 00:19:49,735
Thank you

348
00:19:52,535 --> 00:19:53,975
When I woke up,

349
00:19:55,935 --> 00:19:57,374
Besides Lu Xiabei,

350
00:19:58,975 --> 00:20:01,054
Don't tell anyone else.

351
00:20:06,614 --> 00:20:07,654
Help me up.

352
00:20:07,975 --> 00:20:08,414
Old sand.

353
00:20:10,975 --> 00:20:11,975
Slow down.

354
00:20:15,654 --> 00:20:16,334
Slow down.

355
00:20:24,775 --> 00:20:25,975
Old Sha has changed.

356
00:20:27,334 --> 00:20:28,215
Unicorn

357
00:20:29,614 --> 00:20:30,574
You've become handsome.

358
00:20:31,614 --> 00:20:32,854
Your hairstyle

359
00:20:33,054 --> 00:20:34,775
Is exactly the same as mine.

360
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:38,015
He dressed you like him back then.

361
00:20:44,374 --> 00:20:45,535
For 11 years,

362
00:20:47,695 --> 00:20:49,134
What happened?

363
00:20:49,775 --> 00:20:50,854
That's too much.

364
00:20:51,574 --> 00:20:53,015
We Chinese writers

365
00:20:53,574 --> 00:20:55,094
And won the Nobel Literature Prize.

366
00:20:56,015 --> 00:20:56,854
but

367
00:20:57,255 --> 00:20:59,975
Your favorite author, Mr. Jin Yong, is dead.

368
00:21:00,775 --> 00:21:02,455
Where are my parents?

369
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:04,495
My parents are doing well.

370
00:21:05,334 --> 00:21:07,535
When I talked about you,

371
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:09,175
And shed tears.

372
00:21:15,134 --> 00:21:15,975
The Coin Team.

373
00:21:17,015 --> 00:21:17,975
The other players

374
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:19,414
What about

375
00:21:19,414 --> 00:21:20,455
Are all fine.

376
00:21:21,255 --> 00:21:23,094
The acupuncture clinic of Lao Sha.

377
00:21:23,455 --> 00:21:24,495
To open a chain store.

378
00:21:25,175 --> 00:21:28,695
Ming's logistics business is understandable.

379
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:30,574
monkey

380
00:21:30,574 --> 00:21:31,735
And became a civil servant.

381
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:34,935
Do you want to hear An Lan the most?

382
00:21:34,935 --> 00:21:38,334
An Lan is now an executive of a game company.

383
00:21:38,334 --> 00:21:38,935
Yes

384
00:21:39,295 --> 00:21:40,574
What are you doing now?

385
00:21:40,854 --> 00:21:41,775
CFHD

386
00:21:41,775 --> 00:21:43,374
If you need anything,

387
00:21:43,374 --> 00:21:44,614
Just tell me.

388
00:21:44,614 --> 00:21:45,614
I'll arrange it for you.

389
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:49,374
What's up

390
00:21:50,414 --> 00:21:51,574
Where's Xu Wei?

391
00:21:52,255 --> 00:21:53,654
I know. Stay on the team.

392
00:21:53,654 --> 00:21:55,735
It's not easy to play all the way to the finals.

393
00:21:56,134 --> 00:21:57,614
The script of a loser turning over.

394
00:21:57,614 --> 00:21:58,894
Everyone loves it.

395
00:21:58,894 --> 00:22:01,255
But gravity is the most important thing

396
00:22:01,255 --> 00:22:03,094
A year with the strongest overall strength.

397
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:04,735
We are confident that we will gain.

398
00:22:04,735 --> 00:22:06,295
The third championship trophy.

399
00:22:06,295 --> 00:22:06,935
Someone said that

400
00:22:06,935 --> 00:22:09,654
The development strategy of Gravity Team is to rely on money to pave the way.

401
00:22:09,654 --> 00:22:11,015
To acquire the best players.

402
00:22:11,015 --> 00:22:12,654
And monopolize the whole league.

403
00:22:12,654 --> 00:22:13,535
For a long time,

404
00:22:13,535 --> 00:22:15,374
The development of the alliance will be unbalanced.

405
00:22:15,374 --> 00:22:15,814
President Xu.

406
00:22:15,814 --> 00:22:17,574
What do you think of this idea?

407
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:20,614
We're not doing charity work.

408
00:22:20,614 --> 00:22:22,975
Winning the game is always the highest goal.

409
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:25,695
Saying that we monopolize the best players.

410
00:22:26,695 --> 00:22:28,414
That's just an excuse for a loser.

411
00:22:29,574 --> 00:22:31,614
President Xu.

412
00:22:36,535 --> 00:22:37,455
CFPL

413
00:22:37,455 --> 00:22:39,054
Crossfire Professional League

414
00:22:39,054 --> 00:22:42,054
Represents the highest level of competition in China.

415
00:22:42,054 --> 00:22:43,574
Is the most attention in the country.

416
00:22:43,574 --> 00:22:46,255
And the most important cross-fire professional event.

417
00:22:46,255 --> 00:22:47,654
The winner will represent China.

418
00:22:47,654 --> 00:22:49,654
To participate in the Crossfire World Finals.

419
00:22:49,654 --> 00:22:50,814
CFS

420
00:22:54,854 --> 00:22:57,574
From all over the country.

421
00:22:57,935 --> 00:22:59,295
How are you?

422
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,775
good

423
00:23:03,935 --> 00:23:05,414
Welcome to the Crossfire League.

424
00:23:05,414 --> 00:23:08,175
The National Finals live.

425
00:23:08,175 --> 00:23:09,535
To witness with us.

426
00:23:09,535 --> 00:23:11,654
The birth of the champion.

427
00:23:12,495 --> 00:23:14,255
The champion will be

428
00:23:14,255 --> 00:23:15,935
According to the winner,

429
00:23:15,935 --> 00:23:17,654
Exclusive champion suit.

430
00:23:27,054 --> 00:23:28,455
I have long heard that

431
00:23:28,455 --> 00:23:30,175
I have the habit of washing my hands with cold water.

432
00:23:30,574 --> 00:23:32,535
To prevent the muscle pain, right?

433
00:23:35,775 --> 00:23:37,255
To prevent your hands from sweating.

434
00:23:38,654 --> 00:23:39,735
I guessed wrong.

435
00:23:47,215 --> 00:23:48,374
You don't know me well.

436
00:23:50,775 --> 00:23:52,535
We have known each other for 11 years.

437
00:23:53,215 --> 00:23:54,295
Eleven years ago,

438
00:23:54,295 --> 00:23:55,215
Do we know each other?

439
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:57,775
The day before yesterday, North Road.

440
00:23:58,094 --> 00:23:59,334
I won't remember it wrong.

441
00:24:02,255 --> 00:24:03,455
What Tianbei Road?

442
00:24:04,054 --> 00:24:05,175
I don't understand.

443
00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:13,374
Let me help you recall it.

444
00:24:16,334 --> 00:24:18,495
Eleven years ago, Tianbei Road of Ningjiang

445
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,414
You're driving a car and forcing the line.

446
00:24:29,414 --> 00:24:30,775
And knocked down two boys.

447
00:24:32,495 --> 00:24:34,775
The two boys were killed and maimed on the spot.

448
00:24:35,935 --> 00:24:37,814
My brother died and I was injured.

449
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,295
I've always been curious.

450
00:24:46,495 --> 00:24:47,374
For so many years,

451
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:52,975
How can you be at ease?

452
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:57,495
Xiao Bei, are you all right?

453
00:24:59,134 --> 00:24:59,975
What are you talking about?

454
00:25:00,695 --> 00:25:02,535
Do you really think no one knows?

455
00:25:02,975 --> 00:25:04,654
Do you really think Xiao Feng has a mouth sealed?

456
00:25:04,654 --> 00:25:06,015
No one in the world

457
00:25:06,015 --> 00:25:07,134
Do you know your background?

458
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:09,775
Do you really think that

459
00:25:10,094 --> 00:25:11,015
Is perfect.

460
00:25:11,015 --> 00:25:12,175
Is flawless?

461
00:25:13,175 --> 00:25:13,935
I'm telling you,

462
00:25:14,935 --> 00:25:15,894
It's not because I didn't report it.

463
00:25:17,574 --> 00:25:18,535
It's not time yet.

464
00:25:19,735 --> 00:25:20,495
Xiaobei

465
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:22,735
I really don't know what you're talking about.

466
00:25:22,735 --> 00:25:24,775
All I know is you don't have any evidence.

467
00:25:25,374 --> 00:25:27,054
Otherwise, the person who talks to me here

468
00:25:27,054 --> 00:25:28,054
It's not you.

469
00:25:28,054 --> 00:25:29,054
But the police.

470
00:25:29,334 --> 00:25:31,015
The police will come to you sooner or later.

471
00:25:33,134 --> 00:25:34,015
Xiaobei

472
00:25:34,295 --> 00:25:36,334
I don't know what rumors you heard,

473
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,374
I only know that your brother's death

474
00:25:38,374 --> 00:25:39,854
It hurts you a lot.

475
00:25:39,854 --> 00:25:41,054
I feel sorry for you.

476
00:25:41,054 --> 00:25:42,015
But you can't.

477
00:25:59,614 --> 00:26:00,975
You kicked me into Hundred Cities.

478
00:26:03,134 --> 00:26:03,975
I crawled out.

479
00:26:07,374 --> 00:26:08,654
You broke my leg.

480
00:26:09,215 --> 00:26:10,814
I'm standing in front of you.

481
00:26:12,735 --> 00:26:13,894
What else can you do?

482
00:26:15,414 --> 00:26:16,414
Don't hesitate.

483
00:26:27,695 --> 00:26:28,695
Lieutenant

484
00:26:34,295 --> 00:26:35,455
Be the first.

485
00:26:37,455 --> 00:26:38,414
And then do something.

486
00:26:39,134 --> 00:26:39,854
I'm telling you, Captain,

487
00:26:39,854 --> 00:26:41,054
Don't do this to me.

488
00:26:41,414 --> 00:26:43,455
You should be a man first.

489
00:26:44,094 --> 00:26:44,854
If you can't do it well,

490
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:46,495
You can't do anything.

491
00:26:48,094 --> 00:26:48,935
Don't you remember?

492
00:27:07,255 --> 00:27:07,735
feed

493
00:27:08,495 --> 00:27:09,574
Is it the nurses station?

494
00:27:11,374 --> 00:27:12,215
My surname is Xu.

495
00:27:12,854 --> 00:27:14,455
Xiao Feng's friend in ward 2016.

496
00:27:14,775 --> 00:27:16,094
Who often goes to see him.

497
00:27:16,614 --> 00:27:17,574
President Xu.

498
00:27:17,574 --> 00:27:18,574
What's wrong?

499
00:27:19,414 --> 00:27:21,134
I've been away on business for the past two months.

500
00:27:21,134 --> 00:27:22,175
I don't have time to see him.

501
00:27:22,455 --> 00:27:23,455
How is he recently?

502
00:27:23,695 --> 00:27:24,695
He's still the same.

503
00:27:24,695 --> 00:27:26,134
The physical indicators are normal.

504
00:27:27,414 --> 00:27:28,894
Okay, take good care of him.

505
00:27:29,094 --> 00:27:29,775
Please.

506
00:27:37,975 --> 00:27:39,295
Hello, Mr. Huo?

507
00:27:39,455 --> 00:27:39,975
It's me.

508
00:27:40,094 --> 00:27:41,414
Mr. Xu just called.

509
00:27:41,414 --> 00:27:42,775
To ask about Xiao Feng.

510
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:44,215
OK

511
00:27:44,814 --> 00:27:45,535
I know.

512
00:27:45,814 --> 00:27:46,414
Thank you

513
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,455
Not only do we have to win,

514
00:27:53,654 --> 00:27:55,175
And crush your opponent.

515
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:56,574
More aggressive.

516
00:27:57,094 --> 00:27:58,854
So the audience will be excited.

517
00:27:59,654 --> 00:28:00,614
A champion.

518
00:28:00,975 --> 00:28:02,334
They will call it luck.

519
00:28:02,334 --> 00:28:03,054
Twice.

520
00:28:03,414 --> 00:28:04,495
I would say it's strength.

521
00:28:04,495 --> 00:28:05,374
The third time.

522
00:28:07,015 --> 00:28:08,455
Will become a legend.

523
00:28:09,614 --> 00:28:10,414
tonight

524
00:28:10,854 --> 00:28:12,654
You are the ones who created the legend.

525
00:28:13,295 --> 00:28:14,215
Are you confident?

526
00:28:14,215 --> 00:28:14,854
Yes

527
00:28:19,455 --> 00:28:21,295
The champion will always be attractive.

528
00:28:21,495 --> 00:28:23,535
The champion will always be attractive.

529
00:28:28,215 --> 00:28:28,814
King

530
00:28:31,814 --> 00:28:33,094
The peak of a player.

531
00:28:33,735 --> 00:28:36,094
Is to make a key performance in the key game.

532
00:28:36,854 --> 00:28:38,654
I hope you can suppress Lu Xiao Bei.

533
00:28:38,654 --> 00:28:39,894
Give him no chance.

534
00:28:40,134 --> 00:28:41,854
When the game is over,

535
00:28:42,695 --> 00:28:44,295
You will be the god of the war.

536
00:28:54,495 --> 00:28:56,295
You are the best.

537
00:28:56,295 --> 00:28:57,255
I hope that

538
00:28:57,255 --> 00:28:59,775
And let the idols feel your passion.

539
00:29:00,134 --> 00:29:03,054
Continue to scream and shout.

540
00:29:04,455 --> 00:29:06,695
The two teams that came to the scene today

541
00:29:06,695 --> 00:29:09,015
One is our defending champion team.

542
00:29:09,015 --> 00:29:10,535
Gravitational Team.

543
00:29:10,535 --> 00:29:12,935
Okay, the other team is the Dark Horse Team.

544
00:29:13,054 --> 00:29:14,495
Go on.

545
00:29:14,495 --> 00:29:15,134
to accept

546
00:29:15,134 --> 00:29:17,175
Let's give the warmest applause.

547
00:29:17,175 --> 00:29:20,574
And call out the Crossfire Professional League.

548
00:29:20,574 --> 00:29:22,255
Our defending champion

549
00:29:22,255 --> 00:29:23,735
Gravitational Team.

550
00:29:26,495 --> 00:29:36,574
gravitation

551
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:37,334
Did you hear that?

552
00:29:37,614 --> 00:29:39,255
Most of the following are fans of Gravity.

553
00:29:39,255 --> 00:29:43,175
gravitation

554
00:29:43,175 --> 00:29:44,775
Everyone knows that Gravity Team

555
00:29:44,775 --> 00:29:46,175
Won the championship for two consecutive years.

556
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:47,854
And it's a sure thing today.

557
00:29:47,854 --> 00:29:48,854
And confident.

558
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:51,015
Then I'll first introduce you to

559
00:29:51,015 --> 00:29:53,015
The first is our breakthrough player.

560
00:29:53,015 --> 00:29:54,175
BOOM

561
00:29:54,175 --> 00:29:55,054
I saw it backstage.

562
00:29:55,054 --> 00:29:56,814
Gravity has even pulled the banner of the champion.

563
00:29:57,054 --> 00:29:59,414
And our defending assistant 101.

564
00:29:59,414 --> 00:30:00,935
They want to put pressure on us.

565
00:30:01,495 --> 00:30:02,614
The pressure is relative.

566
00:30:03,374 --> 00:30:04,654
Will fall on them.

567
00:30:05,854 --> 00:30:06,775
So many fans.

568
00:30:07,775 --> 00:30:08,894
They can't lose.

569
00:30:09,535 --> 00:30:10,894
And our Empress Dowager.

570
00:30:11,134 --> 00:30:12,295
G02

571
00:30:14,094 --> 00:30:15,455
Okay, the last one.

572
00:30:15,455 --> 00:30:16,654
Is very handsome.

573
00:30:16,654 --> 00:30:18,975
Our sniper and captain

574
00:30:18,975 --> 00:30:20,175
King

575
00:30:23,775 --> 00:30:24,894
Next, let's welcome

576
00:30:24,894 --> 00:30:26,015
For the first time this year,

577
00:30:26,015 --> 00:30:27,854
The dark horse of the Crossfire Professional League.

578
00:30:27,854 --> 00:30:29,814
Go on.

579
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:46,054
Go on.

580
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:47,414
Okay, let's introduce

581
00:30:47,414 --> 00:30:49,015
The first is our breakthrough player.

582
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:50,854
AK Little Prince Nezha

583
00:30:51,455 --> 00:30:54,614
Okay, the second one is the rock solid Broken Empress Cookie.

584
00:30:55,134 --> 00:30:57,894
And Kai, our best breakout player.

585
00:30:58,455 --> 00:30:59,814
The next one is

586
00:30:59,814 --> 00:31:02,574
Ghost Goddess S + 1.

587
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:04,495
At the same time,

588
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:06,614
The core team leader and sniper

589
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:07,975
Our North.

590
00:31:10,574 --> 00:31:12,854
Let's give them applause again.

591
00:31:13,894 --> 00:31:16,015
OK, I also look forward to two teams.

592
00:31:16,015 --> 00:31:18,975
And achieve excellent results in the next event.

593
00:31:18,975 --> 00:31:20,535
And wonderful performance.

594
00:31:20,535 --> 00:31:22,455
Come on

595
00:31:25,495 --> 00:31:26,414
Okay, so now,

596
00:31:26,414 --> 00:31:27,495
You can see two teams.

597
00:31:27,495 --> 00:31:28,695
Has entered the battle room.

598
00:31:28,894 --> 00:31:30,094
And started to prepare.

599
00:31:31,215 --> 00:31:31,894
Hello, everyone.

600
00:31:31,894 --> 00:31:33,374
Welcome to 2020.

601
00:31:33,374 --> 00:31:35,015
Crossing the Line of Fire Professional League Finals.

602
00:31:35,015 --> 00:31:36,654
I'm the White Shark of the Fighting Fish.

603
00:31:36,654 --> 00:31:38,175
I'm a fighting fish interpreter.

604
00:31:38,374 --> 00:31:40,495
Finally, we come to the final.

605
00:31:40,495 --> 00:31:41,215
This battle

606
00:31:41,215 --> 00:31:43,295
Will definitely be the ultimate battle.

607
00:31:43,295 --> 00:31:43,654
that's right

608
00:31:43,654 --> 00:31:45,334
And we can see the scene coming.

609
00:31:45,334 --> 00:31:46,215
A lot of fans.

610
00:31:46,215 --> 00:31:48,134
And they are very enthusiastic.

611
00:31:48,134 --> 00:31:51,175
The final is the defending champion for two years.

612
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:52,455
On the one hand, he is a dark horse.

613
00:31:52,455 --> 00:31:54,054
To the final.

614
00:31:54,054 --> 00:31:55,134
Do you think this final

615
00:31:55,134 --> 00:31:57,495
Who has a better chance of winning the championship?

616
00:31:57,495 --> 00:31:58,935
I'm more in favor of continuing the team.

617
00:31:58,935 --> 00:32:01,295
Because there is a man in the team

618
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:03,175
The only female player in the league.

619
00:32:03,175 --> 00:32:03,975
S＋1

620
00:32:04,175 --> 00:32:05,854
Yes, S + 1 is indeed us.

621
00:32:05,854 --> 00:32:07,414
The only female player in the league.

622
00:32:07,414 --> 00:32:09,334
I hope she can be

623
00:32:09,334 --> 00:32:10,654
Have a good play.

624
00:32:11,015 --> 00:32:12,334
Both teams have them.

625
00:32:12,334 --> 00:32:13,574
His ace player.

626
00:32:13,574 --> 00:32:14,374
On one side is King.

627
00:32:14,374 --> 00:32:15,334
One side is Lu Xiao Bei.

628
00:32:15,495 --> 00:32:17,015
We can see King and Lu Xiabei

629
00:32:17,015 --> 00:32:18,455
To enter the battle seat.

630
00:32:18,455 --> 00:32:19,574
In the active preparation,

631
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:21,414
But I feel that Lu Xiao Bei

632
00:32:21,414 --> 00:32:23,374
Back then, I also fought with Lu Xiao Bei.

633
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:25,054
I gave him this room.

634
00:32:25,894 --> 00:32:26,935
I gave them to you.

635
00:32:28,175 --> 00:32:29,574
I hope the final will be

636
00:32:29,975 --> 00:32:32,775
Lu Xiao Bei, you must play hard.

637
00:32:33,134 --> 00:32:34,414
Don't embarrass Ning Jiang.

638
00:32:34,775 --> 00:32:36,334
To win this game.

639
00:32:46,935 --> 00:32:47,255
OK

640
00:32:47,255 --> 00:32:49,054
We're here for the Gravity Team and the Continuing Team.

641
00:32:49,054 --> 00:32:50,735
The first competition maps the foreign town.

642
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:52,334
The Continuation Team will act as a sleeper.

643
00:32:52,334 --> 00:32:53,535
Gravity plays the defender.

644
00:32:53,535 --> 00:32:55,414
This is a picture of an alien town

645
00:32:55,414 --> 00:32:56,814
Has certain advantages.

646
00:32:56,814 --> 00:32:58,374
Yes, but it depends on the tactical cooperation of both sides.

647
00:32:58,374 --> 00:32:59,814
And the sniping of the two teams.

648
00:32:59,814 --> 00:33:01,735
The opening of G02 went straight to gate B.

649
00:33:01,735 --> 00:33:02,695
I want to suppress them.

650
00:33:02,695 --> 00:33:03,134
Don't go to the middle.

651
00:33:03,134 --> 00:33:04,334
North was spying on Gate B.

652
00:33:04,334 --> 00:33:05,134
Let's have a look.

653
00:33:05,134 --> 00:33:05,735
The B bridge is gone.

654
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:07,695
Wear G02 off at the front.

655
00:33:07,695 --> 00:33:09,255
King started to shrink.

656
00:33:09,535 --> 00:33:10,654
Kai here, seize the chance.

657
00:33:10,654 --> 00:33:11,735
Press on B path.

658
00:33:11,735 --> 00:33:13,295
He pulled a gun and took away 101.

659
00:33:13,295 --> 00:33:15,495
Here S + 1 also stole the unguarded BOOM.

660
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:17,334
Go on. The team chose to do it directly.

661
00:33:17,334 --> 00:33:18,255
North sealed the smoke.

662
00:33:18,255 --> 00:33:19,414
Point B is full of smoke.

663
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,574
King is a tough side.

664
00:33:20,935 --> 00:33:22,255
Wait. King didn't notice.

665
00:33:22,255 --> 00:33:23,295
Nezha went to the back.

666
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:24,295
Killed one.

667
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:24,854
Two

668
00:33:24,854 --> 00:33:26,175
And knocked out King.

669
00:33:26,175 --> 00:33:28,175
The team won the first point.

670
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:29,094
We can see that

671
00:33:29,094 --> 00:33:30,975
The team did some research on gravity.

672
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:33,015
Yes, the tactics are targeted.

673
00:33:33,015 --> 00:33:34,695
King started directly to the B Bridge.

674
00:33:35,775 --> 00:33:37,134
S + 1 was destroyed in the first place.

675
00:33:37,574 --> 00:33:38,695
King draws the Rookie again

676
00:33:38,695 --> 00:33:40,495
King's sniping was really great.

677
00:33:40,495 --> 00:33:42,054
North on the other side, lead the attack on point B.

678
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:44,094
Sugar jumped straight out.

679
00:33:44,094 --> 00:33:45,574
That's a little unwise.

680
00:33:45,574 --> 00:33:47,334
You can see that the package is now a two-for-four.

681
00:33:47,334 --> 00:33:48,735
North took 101 with one shot.

682
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:49,854
Kai got one too.

683
00:33:49,854 --> 00:33:50,614
There's a chance.

684
00:33:50,614 --> 00:33:52,175
North changed the pistol and killed Boom.

685
00:33:52,175 --> 00:33:53,175
King also seized the chance.

686
00:33:53,175 --> 00:33:54,414
Backhand knocks off North.

687
00:33:54,414 --> 00:33:55,495
Is there still a chance?

688
00:33:56,175 --> 00:33:57,374
Was finally taken away by Kai.

689
00:33:57,374 --> 00:33:58,495
It's too fierce.

690
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:00,854
The first two rounds were so anxious.

691
00:34:00,854 --> 00:34:03,134
Let people look forward to their next game.

692
00:34:04,894 --> 00:34:06,295
Boss Luo said that

693
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:08,935
As long as Lu Xiao Bei wins the national championship,

694
00:34:08,935 --> 00:34:10,455
It's free.

695
00:34:11,975 --> 00:34:12,814
Section B is in Section B.

696
00:34:12,814 --> 00:34:13,975
There's one missing from Alley A.

697
00:34:13,975 --> 00:34:14,574
There's one in the middle.

698
00:34:14,574 --> 00:34:15,574
Hit the middle first.

699
00:34:15,574 --> 00:34:16,975
A Alley has been there.

700
00:34:16,975 --> 00:34:18,094
I lost the middle road.

701
00:34:20,255 --> 00:34:21,295
The last two are in A.

702
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:23,814
Seal the smoke.

703
00:34:24,535 --> 00:34:25,255
pretty

704
00:34:25,414 --> 00:34:26,775
Lu Xiao Bei, double kill.

705
00:34:27,134 --> 00:34:29,295
So the team went on to win 10 to 7.

706
00:34:29,295 --> 00:34:30,894
And won the first round.

707
00:34:31,455 --> 00:34:33,535
Today's game is beyond everyone's expectation.

708
00:34:33,535 --> 00:34:35,295
The team is more prepared.

709
00:34:35,295 --> 00:34:37,574
Now the pressure is on the side of gravity.

710
00:34:37,574 --> 00:34:38,695
The next round,

711
00:34:38,695 --> 00:34:40,574
Can they turn the situation around?

712
00:34:40,574 --> 00:34:42,015
I believe that King has not yet played

713
00:34:42,015 --> 00:34:43,215
What he should have.

714
00:34:50,695 --> 00:34:51,334
Comrades,

715
00:34:52,054 --> 00:34:53,414
The game was too smooth.

716
00:34:53,414 --> 00:34:54,814
The defending champion.

717
00:34:55,215 --> 00:34:56,654
We just need to win one more game.

718
00:34:56,654 --> 00:34:58,654
We'll be the national champions.

719
00:35:02,455 --> 00:35:04,015
According to our previous plan,

720
00:35:04,015 --> 00:35:05,455
King went to the middle gate to set up the A path.

721
00:35:05,455 --> 00:35:06,295
Tell me at any time.

722
00:35:06,295 --> 00:35:07,255
Boom and G02

723
00:35:07,455 --> 00:35:08,295
Top A is big.

724
00:35:09,495 --> 00:35:10,374
You can't fight like this anymore.

725
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:11,654
The opposite knows our tricks.

726
00:35:11,654 --> 00:35:12,854
You must guard against Package A at the beginning.

727
00:35:12,854 --> 00:35:14,574
G02 and 101 are going to rob A university.

728
00:35:14,574 --> 00:35:16,215
If the other side doesn't rob the A University,

729
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:18,175
101, stay near Big A Pigpen.

730
00:35:18,175 --> 00:35:19,654
I'll press to the position under the B Bridge.

731
00:35:19,654 --> 00:35:21,455
Seal off A and B 1.

732
00:35:22,455 --> 00:35:23,455
Are you clear?

733
00:35:24,134 --> 00:35:25,134
understand

734
00:35:25,535 --> 00:35:26,054
understand

735
00:35:26,535 --> 00:35:27,894
Next round, Black Town.

736
00:35:28,574 --> 00:35:29,854
This is their best picture.

737
00:35:29,854 --> 00:35:30,775
They won a lot.

738
00:35:31,735 --> 00:35:33,414
They like to set up the A path.

739
00:35:33,414 --> 00:35:34,695
And send two people to the top A.

740
00:35:36,695 --> 00:35:37,975
When I pull the middle road,

741
00:35:38,255 --> 00:35:39,215
Remember to help me fill the next position.

742
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:40,894
No problem. I'll do it.

743
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:48,255
Let's go.

744
00:35:48,574 --> 00:35:49,255
It's time to play.

745
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,215
come

746
00:35:56,094 --> 00:35:57,574
Just follow the drill.

747
00:35:58,175 --> 00:36:00,935
Come on

748
00:36:22,334 --> 00:36:23,374
Big A.

749
00:36:25,654 --> 00:36:26,495
I dropped it.

750
00:36:39,935 --> 00:36:42,094
The gravitational wave is very beautiful.

751
00:36:42,094 --> 00:36:43,894
King finally played his own strength.

752
00:36:43,894 --> 00:36:45,215
And played three times in a row.

753
00:36:45,455 --> 00:36:46,735
We started with a three-nil.

754
00:36:46,735 --> 00:36:47,935
But I still want to

755
00:36:47,935 --> 00:36:49,935
I believe after a tough start,

756
00:36:49,935 --> 00:36:51,454
They are gradually stabilizing their position.

757
00:36:51,454 --> 00:36:52,934
And started to score points.

758
00:36:52,934 --> 00:36:54,814
Go on. The team chose to play B.

759
00:36:54,814 --> 00:36:56,095
Is to compete with gravity.

760
00:36:56,534 --> 00:36:57,414
Kai knocks out King

761
00:36:57,735 --> 00:36:58,655
And took away Boom.

762
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,215
Although Gravity has been leading in the second round,

763
00:37:03,215 --> 00:37:05,615
But the team played patiently.

764
00:37:05,615 --> 00:37:06,814
And won't let go of the score.

765
00:37:07,055 --> 00:37:08,414
Especially the mess.

766
00:37:08,575 --> 00:37:10,095
Lu Xiao Bei really dared to fight.

767
00:37:10,414 --> 00:37:11,494
We're only two points away.

768
00:37:11,494 --> 00:37:12,575
If the trend continues,

769
00:37:12,575 --> 00:37:14,175
The team is likely to tie.

770
00:37:14,414 --> 00:37:16,295
It's really hard to say.

771
00:37:48,775 --> 00:37:50,655
Point A, two behind the box.

772
00:37:56,695 --> 00:37:57,615
What's going on here?

773
00:37:57,615 --> 00:37:59,175
Look at those two thunder eyes.

774
00:37:59,175 --> 00:38:00,494
And rushed towards us.

775
00:38:00,494 --> 00:38:01,135
sorry

776
00:38:01,374 --> 00:38:02,454
It's all my fault.

777
00:38:02,454 --> 00:38:04,215
Who can watch them?

778
00:38:04,334 --> 00:38:05,334
Do you think

779
00:38:05,934 --> 00:38:07,014
Something's wrong.

780
00:38:07,014 --> 00:38:07,974
What's wrong?

781
00:38:08,334 --> 00:38:10,255
We've never been in the A box.

782
00:38:10,575 --> 00:38:11,255
They just came up.

783
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,414
And attacked the spot.

784
00:38:12,414 --> 00:38:13,255
It's nonsense.

785
00:38:13,414 --> 00:38:14,215
I don't think so.

786
00:38:14,534 --> 00:38:15,735
Their position just now.

787
00:38:16,454 --> 00:38:18,135
It felt like I knew someone was there from the beginning.

788
00:38:18,135 --> 00:38:20,255
They can't be doing clairvoyance.

789
00:38:20,414 --> 00:38:21,055
impossible

790
00:38:21,454 --> 00:38:22,854
The machine is provided by the committee.

791
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:23,854
Don't worry about it.

792
00:38:24,334 --> 00:38:25,215
Focus.

793
00:38:25,615 --> 00:38:26,374
Make a shot.

794
00:38:30,974 --> 00:38:32,295
There are three in the A direction.

795
00:38:32,295 --> 00:38:33,175
Don't worry. Trust me.

796
00:38:33,175 --> 00:38:34,135
OK

797
00:38:35,055 --> 00:38:35,454
I

798
00:38:35,454 --> 00:38:36,414
It's in B.

799
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:37,295
Under the box,

800
00:38:38,175 --> 00:38:38,575
No

801
00:38:38,575 --> 00:38:39,534
package

802
00:38:40,854 --> 00:38:41,494
how could that be?

803
00:38:41,494 --> 00:38:42,135
Where is she?

804
00:38:42,135 --> 00:38:43,295
I don't know either

805
00:38:43,295 --> 00:38:44,374
Pack your bags.

806
00:38:44,735 --> 00:38:45,534
A is dead.

807
00:38:47,454 --> 00:38:48,414
I was worn to death.

808
00:38:48,414 --> 00:38:48,934
Point A.

809
00:39:04,334 --> 00:39:05,534
Middle Road Bridge.
