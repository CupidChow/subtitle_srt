1
00:03:13,138 --> 00:03:14,111
Brother Peng.

2
00:03:14,603 --> 00:03:15,402
I'm Chang Sha.

3
00:03:15,923 --> 00:03:16,803
Come in.

4
00:03:19,723 --> 00:03:21,602
I only drink coke. I want ice.

5
00:03:23,322 --> 00:03:24,563
Go get it for him.

6
00:03:25,523 --> 00:03:26,363
Brother Peng.

7
00:03:27,043 --> 00:03:29,003
Did you know something happened to our team?

8
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:30,602
What's your plan?

9
00:03:30,802 --> 00:03:31,843
I didn't know that.

10
00:03:31,843 --> 00:03:33,082
So I came to see you.

11
00:03:33,602 --> 00:03:35,442
You can't have no plan.

12
00:03:36,043 --> 00:03:38,082
Your team will be banned soon.

13
00:03:38,082 --> 00:03:38,802
You know what?

14
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,483
The specific penalty result of our team

15
00:03:40,483 --> 00:03:41,203
He hasn't come down yet.

16
00:03:41,203 --> 00:03:41,962
Are waiting for an announcement.

17
00:03:41,962 --> 00:03:42,682
Thank you

18
00:03:42,962 --> 00:03:44,962
You can't take such chances.

19
00:03:44,962 --> 00:03:46,002
You know what?

20
00:03:46,282 --> 00:03:48,803
You can figure it out with your heels.

21
00:03:48,803 --> 00:03:49,843
Don't drink it.

22
00:03:50,883 --> 00:03:52,602
Isn't Xiao Feng a fool?

23
00:03:52,602 --> 00:03:54,602
How could you point yourself out?

24
00:03:56,322 --> 00:03:57,563
Xiao Feng is not stupid.

25
00:03:57,563 --> 00:03:59,203
Xiao Feng is a wise woman.

26
00:03:59,203 --> 00:04:00,962
What wisdom?

27
00:04:01,203 --> 00:04:01,843
Brother Peng.

28
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:04,042
I'm here to tell you a piece of good news.

29
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:05,563
Our team has decided

30
00:04:05,563 --> 00:04:07,083
To compete with your team.

31
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,602
What game?

32
00:04:10,722 --> 00:04:11,362
Brother Peng.

33
00:04:13,203 --> 00:04:13,922
What are you doing?

34
00:04:14,642 --> 00:04:15,882
Do you feel that

35
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:17,442
I feel dizzy during the day.

36
00:04:17,763 --> 00:04:18,323
Somewhat

37
00:04:18,323 --> 00:04:19,963
The soles of your feet get cold at night.

38
00:04:20,722 --> 00:04:22,403
I often wake up with nightmares.

39
00:04:22,603 --> 00:04:23,203
That's right.

40
00:04:23,203 --> 00:04:25,403
The most important thing is that your marksmanship is getting worse.

41
00:04:25,403 --> 00:04:26,403
How do you know?

42
00:04:27,922 --> 00:04:29,922
That's what we do to people who spy.

43
00:04:29,922 --> 00:04:31,082
This is an occupational disease.

44
00:04:31,082 --> 00:04:32,442
Xiao Feng and I both have this problem.

45
00:04:32,763 --> 00:04:34,362
My family is a traditional Chinese medicine family.

46
00:04:34,362 --> 00:04:36,162
It's the 17th generation.

47
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,922
Xiao Feng and I have all our problems.

48
00:04:38,922 --> 00:04:40,282
This is very simple.

49
00:04:40,362 --> 00:04:41,203
Four stitches.

50
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:42,082
A shot of Dafan.

51
00:04:42,162 --> 00:04:43,002
The Second Needle Wind Pool.

52
00:04:43,162 --> 00:04:43,963
Three needles, shoulder and neck.

53
00:04:44,082 --> 00:04:45,002
Four needles, shoulder blades.

54
00:04:45,002 --> 00:04:46,002
Do you want to try it?

55
00:04:46,002 --> 00:04:46,683
This...

56
00:04:46,683 --> 00:04:47,642
Dazhui Point.

57
00:04:47,802 --> 00:04:48,522
Do you feel it?

58
00:04:48,603 --> 00:04:49,203
It's comfortable.

59
00:04:49,483 --> 00:04:50,082
Let's do it.

60
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:51,763
Work along both lines

61
00:04:54,282 --> 00:04:55,483
Highlight dragon's shame

62
00:04:59,043 --> 00:04:59,763
Stop, stop.

63
00:04:59,763 --> 00:05:00,563
Don't tie it.

64
00:05:00,563 --> 00:05:01,843
Do you have a medical license?

65
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:02,483
I'm done.

66
00:05:02,483 --> 00:05:03,362
Pull it out.

67
00:05:03,362 --> 00:05:04,522
Go wherever you want.

68
00:05:04,522 --> 00:05:05,483
I'm not looking for you, okay?

69
00:05:05,683 --> 00:05:07,282
It's not finished yet.

70
00:05:07,282 --> 00:05:08,323
We still need to electrify it.

71
00:05:08,963 --> 00:05:09,763
Electrify

72
00:05:09,882 --> 00:05:11,162
Internet addiction treatment center

73
00:05:11,403 --> 00:05:12,362
Professor Yang.

74
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,642
Have you heard of electric shock therapy?

75
00:05:14,922 --> 00:05:15,882
Help!

76
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,162
Call someone to kill someone?

77
00:05:17,162 --> 00:05:18,123
Xiaowei

78
00:05:18,123 --> 00:05:19,042
Am I a fool?

79
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:19,963
I'm a fool.

80
00:05:20,482 --> 00:05:21,363
Pull it out.

81
00:05:25,442 --> 00:05:26,963
That's why Rong came back.

82
00:05:26,963 --> 00:05:28,762
A girl has been waiting for you all day.

83
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,523
I have to wait until you come back.

84
00:05:31,923 --> 00:05:32,602
OK!

85
00:05:43,162 --> 00:05:43,963
Miss Chen.

86
00:05:44,403 --> 00:05:45,602
Why are you here again?

87
00:05:46,442 --> 00:05:47,843
It's the same thing as last time.

88
00:05:48,202 --> 00:05:49,322
The tournament committee

89
00:05:49,322 --> 00:05:50,722
The final punishment for the team.

90
00:05:50,722 --> 00:05:51,442
Hasn't come out yet.

91
00:05:51,442 --> 00:05:53,162
They want us to provide evidence.

92
00:05:53,363 --> 00:05:54,162
If we can get

93
00:05:54,162 --> 00:05:55,523
The recording in your hand

94
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:56,843
At least it can be proved

95
00:05:56,843 --> 00:05:58,363
That cheating was his personal act.

96
00:05:59,202 --> 00:06:00,322
Delete this sentence. No.

97
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:01,803
What's the difference?

98
00:06:02,643 --> 00:06:03,482
At least we have a chance.

99
00:06:03,482 --> 00:06:05,363
You can persuade the organizing committee to reduce the penalty.

100
00:06:07,282 --> 00:06:08,643
Our team has been

101
00:06:08,643 --> 00:06:09,803
It's really hard.

102
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:12,083
You should take responsibility for your mistakes.

103
00:06:12,563 --> 00:06:14,523
This is the positive energy we should have.

104
00:06:14,523 --> 00:06:15,042
yes

105
00:06:15,482 --> 00:06:17,643
We are willing to accept any reasonable penalty.

106
00:06:18,162 --> 00:06:19,363
But compared to the penalty,

107
00:06:19,363 --> 00:06:20,202
We want to make up for it.

108
00:06:20,202 --> 00:06:21,843
To the whole league.

109
00:06:21,843 --> 00:06:23,442
We don't want to lose our team

110
00:06:23,442 --> 00:06:25,162
And ruined everyone's understanding of

111
00:06:25,162 --> 00:06:26,363
Love and hope.

112
00:06:30,162 --> 00:06:30,762
What if

113
00:06:30,762 --> 00:06:32,722
Are you here to lecture me?

114
00:06:32,722 --> 00:06:33,602
I'll tell you what.

115
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:34,923
I have more than you.

116
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:35,803
I just hope

117
00:06:35,803 --> 00:06:37,322
You can give us another chance.

118
00:06:39,202 --> 00:06:39,803
After all is said and done

119
00:06:39,803 --> 00:06:41,363
You still want the recording.

120
00:06:41,363 --> 00:06:42,683
How many times have I told you?

121
00:06:42,683 --> 00:06:44,123
I have deleted the recording.

122
00:06:44,643 --> 00:06:45,482
Leave.

123
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,042
Give it to me.

124
00:06:48,363 --> 00:06:49,202
I brought one.

125
00:06:49,202 --> 00:06:50,202
You always wanted to interview.

126
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,602
He's waiting for you in the coffee shop.

127
00:06:51,963 --> 00:06:53,882
I hope you can make a decision after you see him.

128
00:06:57,482 --> 00:06:58,563
Can we start now?

129
00:07:07,123 --> 00:07:08,482
Why did you cheat?

130
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,202
You played so many games.

131
00:07:10,202 --> 00:07:11,482
I don't know how serious the consequences are.

132
00:07:13,243 --> 00:07:14,202
You want to win?

133
00:07:14,282 --> 00:07:15,563
You want to win?

134
00:07:16,162 --> 00:07:18,243
If you want to win, you don't care about the right and wrong.

135
00:07:18,762 --> 00:07:21,363
Our road is different from others.

136
00:07:22,803 --> 00:07:24,602
If you don't do your best,

137
00:07:24,963 --> 00:07:26,762
Then you're wasting your time.

138
00:07:26,762 --> 00:07:28,563
You're wasting your time.

139
00:07:29,202 --> 00:07:30,002
Regret it?

140
00:07:30,163 --> 00:07:30,803
Do you really want to ask?

141
00:07:30,803 --> 00:07:32,522
Such a meaningless question?

142
00:07:32,723 --> 00:07:34,243
Are you avoiding the answer?

143
00:07:34,243 --> 00:07:35,683
I didn't escape.

144
00:07:35,962 --> 00:07:36,923
I know.

145
00:07:37,803 --> 00:07:39,243
After the interview,

146
00:07:39,522 --> 00:07:41,402
You will write in your report.

147
00:07:42,322 --> 00:07:43,322
The members of the Steel Coin Team

148
00:07:43,322 --> 00:07:44,522
For his despicable act,

149
00:07:44,522 --> 00:07:45,842
I felt so sad.

150
00:07:45,842 --> 00:07:47,483
If I could start over,

151
00:07:48,522 --> 00:07:50,642
He wouldn't touch the external software.

152
00:07:51,283 --> 00:07:52,082
Right?

153
00:07:53,163 --> 00:07:54,402
You can write like this.

154
00:07:54,723 --> 00:07:55,842
But I'm telling you,

155
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,363
If time can be restarted,

156
00:07:59,082 --> 00:08:00,163
I'll do it again.

157
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,202
But I will be more careful.

158
00:08:04,123 --> 00:08:06,002
I won't let anyone get hold of me.

159
00:08:06,283 --> 00:08:08,202
At that time,

160
00:08:08,202 --> 00:08:09,642
I can't find anything else.

161
00:08:09,642 --> 00:08:11,202
To win that game.

162
00:08:12,123 --> 00:08:12,962
I know.

163
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,842
I should please you.

164
00:08:15,603 --> 00:08:17,082
To say what you want to hear.

165
00:08:17,082 --> 00:08:19,202
I beg you to give me the recording.

166
00:08:19,202 --> 00:08:20,683
And let our team

167
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:22,723
And get the chance to start all over again.

168
00:08:22,723 --> 00:08:25,002
But if you want the truth from me,

169
00:08:25,283 --> 00:08:26,202
I'm telling you,

170
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:28,842
I don't want to start over at all.

171
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:29,603
My teammates and I

172
00:08:29,603 --> 00:08:30,882
It's already 20 this year.

173
00:08:30,882 --> 00:08:33,043
At this age, people have already married.

174
00:08:33,043 --> 00:08:34,803
To teach their children how to behave.

175
00:08:34,803 --> 00:08:35,683
What about us?

176
00:08:37,243 --> 00:08:39,082
We are still being educated.

177
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:40,402
you

178
00:08:40,683 --> 00:08:42,123
What are you trying to say?

179
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:44,803
I just want you and our team

180
00:08:44,803 --> 00:08:45,803
To end it.

181
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:47,483
Go ahead.

182
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:48,603
I don't care at all.

183
00:08:48,603 --> 00:08:50,442
What? The committee punished me.

184
00:08:52,803 --> 00:08:54,002
I regret it.

185
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:57,163
I regret that I was born in this age.

186
00:08:57,923 --> 00:08:59,283
Let's fall in love with the game.

187
00:09:00,803 --> 00:09:02,442
But the people of this age

188
00:09:03,163 --> 00:09:04,603
Treat us as different.

189
00:09:05,243 --> 00:09:07,043
Made us the laughing stock of everyone.

190
00:09:10,243 --> 00:09:10,923
But one day,

191
00:09:10,923 --> 00:09:12,762
They'll know they're wrong.

192
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,803
If I'm a little ashamed,

193
00:09:16,402 --> 00:09:17,603
I'm only interested in

194
00:09:17,603 --> 00:09:18,803
For so many years.

195
00:09:18,803 --> 00:09:20,363
Brothers, shame on you.

196
00:09:20,683 --> 00:09:22,082
They thought they could

197
00:09:22,082 --> 00:09:23,642
And end the dream tragically.

198
00:09:26,762 --> 00:09:29,163
I'm the one who broke their dreams.

199
00:09:51,962 --> 00:09:52,923
I'm Chen Rong.

200
00:09:53,762 --> 00:09:55,163
I can give you the recording.

201
00:09:55,322 --> 00:09:56,363
But I have a condition.

202
00:09:57,603 --> 00:09:58,803
I want to tell you

203
00:09:58,803 --> 00:10:00,243
To follow up the interview.

204
00:10:06,483 --> 00:10:07,442
Ningjiang High School.

205
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:08,923
Demon Girl from Class 8, Grade 3.

206
00:10:08,923 --> 00:10:09,603
Chu song

207
00:10:09,603 --> 00:10:10,283
Dad is

208
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,043
Lower your voice.

209
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:16,163
Dad is a murderer.

210
00:10:16,163 --> 00:10:17,322
If you don't pay the debt,

211
00:10:17,322 --> 00:10:18,842
And lent money to his friend with a kitchen knife.

212
00:10:18,842 --> 00:10:19,962
Cut him alive.

213
00:10:20,243 --> 00:10:21,322
With such a father,

214
00:10:21,563 --> 00:10:22,923
What kind of good can a daughter be?

215
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:24,123
When I was in the High School attached to Normal University,

216
00:10:24,363 --> 00:10:25,002
Because of a few words,

217
00:10:25,002 --> 00:10:27,202
And beat the boy in the next class badly.

218
00:10:27,522 --> 00:10:29,522
So cold-blooded genes are inherited.

219
00:10:29,522 --> 00:10:31,082
These people are so stupid.

220
00:10:31,642 --> 00:10:33,243
I've never seen such rumors and bullies.

221
00:10:33,442 --> 00:10:34,842
She even posted the photo.

222
00:10:35,163 --> 00:10:36,483
This is cyber violence.

223
00:10:37,882 --> 00:10:38,723
Can you...

224
00:10:38,723 --> 00:10:40,002
Find someone to check this post.

225
00:10:40,002 --> 00:10:40,882
Network protocol address

226
00:10:40,882 --> 00:10:41,923
It's okay. Take it with me.

227
00:10:44,803 --> 00:10:45,442
Correct!

228
00:10:46,002 --> 00:10:47,762
Aren't you a distant relative of Chu Ge?

229
00:10:47,762 --> 00:10:48,563
this

230
00:10:49,363 --> 00:10:50,243
Is it true?

231
00:10:51,522 --> 00:10:52,683
I heard from my mother.

232
00:10:52,923 --> 00:10:54,522
Her father committed a crime before.

233
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:56,603
But I don't know if it's a murderer.

234
00:11:11,642 --> 00:11:12,322
You're back.

235
00:11:12,322 --> 00:11:13,082
dad

236
00:11:14,202 --> 00:11:15,123
Let me ask you something.

237
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:16,762
In 2009,

238
00:11:16,762 --> 00:11:18,283
A murderer surnamed Chu

239
00:11:18,442 --> 00:11:20,002
He lives on Ning'an Road.

240
00:11:20,002 --> 00:11:21,002
Do you remember?

241
00:11:22,043 --> 00:11:23,683
Why are you suddenly asking about this?

242
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:25,522
no

243
00:11:26,002 --> 00:11:27,723
I heard the students discussing.

244
00:11:28,243 --> 00:11:29,483
So I'm asking you.

245
00:11:31,603 --> 00:11:32,522
I remember.

246
00:11:32,642 --> 00:11:33,762
His name is Chu Donghai.

247
00:11:34,803 --> 00:11:36,002
Because of business.

248
00:11:36,002 --> 00:11:37,202
I owe her money.

249
00:11:37,882 --> 00:11:39,163
The creditors come to us.

250
00:11:39,882 --> 00:11:42,163
Not only destroyed everything in the house,

251
00:11:42,163 --> 00:11:43,763
And take his daughter to pay the debts.

252
00:11:43,763 --> 00:11:44,722
He was too anxious.

253
00:11:44,722 --> 00:11:46,803
And took a knife and cut someone down.

254
00:11:47,842 --> 00:11:48,683
Then,

255
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,003
It was the Second Precinct who went to catch him.

256
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,283
He jumped from the police car.

257
00:11:54,643 --> 00:11:56,482
He died before he reached the hospital.

258
00:11:57,442 --> 00:11:58,283
allegedly

259
00:11:58,442 --> 00:12:00,722
He was going to accompany his daughter to the doctor that day.

260
00:12:00,722 --> 00:12:02,643
So I jumped out of the car.

261
00:12:03,482 --> 00:12:04,563
What about his daughter?

262
00:12:05,362 --> 00:12:06,322
What happened then?

263
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:12,082
The little girl didn't know her father was dead.

264
00:12:12,283 --> 00:12:14,122
She went to the police station.

265
00:12:14,202 --> 00:12:15,803
She wants to see her father.

266
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:17,563
I was the one who received her.

267
00:12:20,043 --> 00:12:21,322
I promised her.

268
00:12:23,403 --> 00:12:24,482
But unfortunately,

269
00:12:25,283 --> 00:12:26,322
That day,

270
00:12:27,482 --> 00:12:29,763
You and your brother had an accident on Tianbei Road.

271
00:12:35,763 --> 00:12:37,003
After two days,

272
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:38,842
I rushed back to the capital.

273
00:12:39,043 --> 00:12:40,482
She's still waiting there.

274
00:12:40,482 --> 00:12:41,962
It's really pitiful.

275
00:12:47,043 --> 00:12:47,602
come

276
00:12:47,602 --> 00:12:48,602
Watch the thigh swing.

277
00:12:48,763 --> 00:12:49,643
It's bigger.

278
00:12:50,362 --> 00:12:51,763
Speed up.

279
00:12:52,842 --> 00:12:53,763
accelerate

280
00:12:54,722 --> 00:12:55,563
good

281
00:12:56,122 --> 00:12:57,163
He's in good condition.

282
00:12:58,442 --> 00:12:59,923
The exam is just a few days away.

283
00:13:00,523 --> 00:13:01,403
As you know,

284
00:13:01,563 --> 00:13:03,362
The competition is very fierce this year.

285
00:13:03,602 --> 00:13:05,482
At least 12 seconds 3 seconds.

286
00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:07,082
To get the ranking.

287
00:13:07,683 --> 00:13:09,202
I know you want to go to the Southern Team.

288
00:13:09,643 --> 00:13:10,962
But you want to join the Southern Team.

289
00:13:10,962 --> 00:13:12,283
You're not the only one.

290
00:13:12,283 --> 00:13:14,322
If you can't get the ranking this time,

291
00:13:14,602 --> 00:13:16,202
Even the walk is hanging.

292
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:17,883
I heard that

293
00:13:17,883 --> 00:13:18,842
There's a girl in the Eighth High School.

294
00:13:18,842 --> 00:13:20,763
The fastest time is 12 seconds.

295
00:13:21,602 --> 00:13:22,563
So Chuge

296
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,403
You have to push yourself.

297
00:13:25,563 --> 00:13:26,962
Okay, I got it.

298
00:13:28,563 --> 00:13:29,883
The sports team has a regular meeting today.

299
00:13:29,883 --> 00:13:30,842
I'm leaving now.

300
00:13:30,842 --> 00:13:31,763
Keep practicing.

301
00:13:41,202 --> 00:13:42,523
Isn't this Chu Ge?

302
00:13:42,842 --> 00:13:44,683
You're a famous person in our school.

303
00:13:44,683 --> 00:13:45,482
Internet celebrity

304
00:13:45,482 --> 00:13:46,763
Sign for us.

305
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:48,082
Take your feet.

306
00:13:50,602 --> 00:13:52,122
If you want to go to the south,

307
00:13:52,322 --> 00:13:53,322
Do you match?

308
00:13:53,643 --> 00:13:55,322
Even if you did,

309
00:13:55,322 --> 00:13:57,322
You're also the daughter of a murderer.

310
00:13:57,322 --> 00:13:59,643
Cold-blooded genes are inherited.

311
00:14:04,602 --> 00:14:05,403
Chu song

312
00:14:09,202 --> 00:14:11,322
Why are you in a wheelchair?

313
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:14,283
Ms Yang from No.13 Huaguang Road North.

314
00:14:15,082 --> 00:14:15,683
How are you?

315
00:14:16,803 --> 00:14:17,883
The network protocol address.

316
00:14:17,883 --> 00:14:18,883
I've found out

317
00:14:20,082 --> 00:14:20,842
Is that your home?

318
00:14:23,482 --> 00:14:24,362
You threatened me.

319
00:14:25,003 --> 00:14:26,122
I just want to tell you that

320
00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:28,082
The Internet is not a place outside the law.

321
00:14:28,082 --> 00:14:30,043
It's illegal to expose others' privacy maliciously.

322
00:14:30,523 --> 00:14:31,523
You're too restrained.

323
00:14:31,523 --> 00:14:32,563
You have one hour.

324
00:14:32,923 --> 00:14:33,883
Delete the post.

325
00:14:35,602 --> 00:14:36,683
Or call the police.

326
00:14:46,082 --> 00:14:47,163
Why are you here again?

327
00:14:47,563 --> 00:14:48,923
Who else do you have besides me?

328
00:14:53,923 --> 00:14:55,202
And post it.

329
00:14:55,683 --> 00:14:56,442
Have you seen it?

330
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,202
Correct!

331
00:15:01,482 --> 00:15:03,602
I found a pair at the mall yesterday.

332
00:15:04,043 --> 00:15:05,482
Your running shoes.

333
00:15:05,482 --> 00:15:06,482
I don't think I can buy it for you.

334
00:15:06,482 --> 00:15:07,763
I feel sorry for myself.

335
00:15:08,122 --> 00:15:08,883
therefore

336
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:13,883
I don't want it.

337
00:15:14,082 --> 00:15:14,842
It's too expensive.

338
00:15:15,523 --> 00:15:16,722
You gave me a pair of socks.

339
00:15:16,722 --> 00:15:18,003
I'll give you a pair of shoes.

340
00:15:19,362 --> 00:15:19,883
Take it.

341
00:15:19,883 --> 00:15:21,643
So many people are watching. How embarrassing I am.

342
00:15:28,322 --> 00:15:29,403
Put it on and run faster.

343
00:15:30,242 --> 00:15:31,482
Don't let others catch up with you.

344
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:37,763
Thank you.

345
00:15:54,242 --> 00:15:55,602
Reporter Chen, have some fruit.

346
00:15:57,482 --> 00:15:58,362
Don't bother me.

347
00:15:58,362 --> 00:15:59,722
You can do whatever you want.

348
00:15:59,722 --> 00:16:01,322
Just pretend I'm not in the room.

349
00:16:01,322 --> 00:16:02,043
Who are you?

350
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:03,362
Besides An Lan, who came to our house,

351
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,283
The second woman

352
00:16:04,283 --> 00:16:06,082
Let's get used to it.

353
00:16:10,722 --> 00:16:11,683
Hello, Reporter Chen.

354
00:16:12,003 --> 00:16:12,602
Hello

355
00:16:12,883 --> 00:16:14,283
What did I ask you to do?

356
00:16:14,523 --> 00:16:15,122
How's it going?

357
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,003
We can talk about it later.

358
00:16:20,082 --> 00:16:21,163
Over the next two months,

359
00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:22,683
I might be with you.

360
00:16:22,683 --> 00:16:23,602
therefore

361
00:16:23,763 --> 00:16:24,442
What's wrong?

362
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,722
You'd better not hide it from me.

363
00:16:27,122 --> 00:16:28,442
The internet café has found a

364
00:16:28,442 --> 00:16:29,763
I can go there at any time, but...

365
00:16:30,082 --> 00:16:31,003
Team.

366
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:32,403
Did you find anyone?

367
00:16:32,842 --> 00:16:34,523
Your mouth is worn out.

368
00:16:34,523 --> 00:16:36,362
No team wants to play with us.

369
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:37,322
We shouldn't have

370
00:16:37,322 --> 00:16:38,763
Go to the primary school.

371
00:16:40,242 --> 00:16:41,883
We're actually looking for

372
00:16:41,883 --> 00:16:43,643
The other teams are going to fight.

373
00:16:46,602 --> 00:16:47,482
What about the Double Battle Team?

374
00:16:47,482 --> 00:16:49,602
Brother, what are you thinking?

375
00:16:50,283 --> 00:16:52,242
He's willing to fight with us now.

376
00:16:52,242 --> 00:16:54,082
Beating us is almost the same.

377
00:16:54,322 --> 00:16:54,962
Lieutenant

378
00:16:55,683 --> 00:16:56,442
The Double Battle Team, are they...

379
00:16:56,442 --> 00:16:58,322
I've been practicing at the Internet cafe on Yumin Road.

380
00:16:59,242 --> 00:17:00,563
Are we really going?

381
00:17:00,563 --> 00:17:02,122
What if there is a real fight?

382
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:04,043
You can't go there empty-handed.

383
00:17:04,563 --> 00:17:05,883
I have some steel pipes.

384
00:17:05,883 --> 00:17:06,643
I'll take it for you.

385
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:07,842
Come back.

386
00:17:07,842 --> 00:17:09,322
Who said there was a fight?

387
00:17:13,923 --> 00:17:14,722
we

388
00:17:16,523 --> 00:17:17,403
Take this.

389
00:17:18,523 --> 00:17:19,842
It's better than your steel pipe.

390
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,803
What are you thinking about? You're picking on a hornet's nest.

391
00:17:22,803 --> 00:17:24,683
If we don't stir up the hornet's nest now,

392
00:17:24,683 --> 00:17:25,803
How are we going to get there?

393
00:17:25,803 --> 00:17:26,842
Have you thought about it?

394
00:17:26,842 --> 00:17:28,763
If the Double Battle Team wants to fight with us,

395
00:17:28,763 --> 00:17:30,763
The other teams won't reject us.

396
00:17:37,362 --> 00:17:38,163
Back, back.

397
00:17:38,163 --> 00:17:39,082
Nice back.

398
00:17:41,003 --> 00:17:42,122
Xiao Feng.

399
00:17:42,442 --> 00:17:43,643
How dare you come?

400
00:17:43,643 --> 00:17:44,362
What's wrong?

401
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:45,722
We can't afford it.

402
00:17:45,722 --> 00:17:46,683
What's wrong?

403
00:17:46,683 --> 00:17:47,322
Do it.

404
00:17:47,322 --> 00:17:47,722
Come on.

405
00:17:47,722 --> 00:17:48,322
Come here.

406
00:17:48,322 --> 00:17:49,082
Come on.

407
00:17:49,923 --> 00:17:51,242
What are we afraid of?

408
00:17:51,962 --> 00:17:52,883
To compete.

409
00:17:52,883 --> 00:17:54,242
Open the auxiliary external hanger.

410
00:17:54,242 --> 00:17:55,523
How dare you?

411
00:17:55,722 --> 00:17:57,043
We only used a plug-in.

412
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:58,482
Is the semi-final with you.

413
00:17:59,122 --> 00:18:01,043
We have surrendered ourselves to the competition committee.

414
00:18:01,722 --> 00:18:02,962
Are waiting for punishment.

415
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:05,122
The result of our competition doesn't count that day.

416
00:18:05,683 --> 00:18:06,803
How about a new date?

417
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:12,442
How can you be confident?

418
00:18:12,442 --> 00:18:13,923
I thought I would agree to it.

419
00:18:16,602 --> 00:18:17,883
We came with sincerity.

420
00:18:17,883 --> 00:18:19,043
Be Sincere in Thought

421
00:18:21,803 --> 00:18:22,883
We didn't see it.

422
00:18:35,442 --> 00:18:37,482
Our team doesn't deserve to win the championship.

423
00:18:37,722 --> 00:18:39,322
But you can't be killed with a club.

424
00:18:40,842 --> 00:18:41,643
We're here today.

425
00:18:41,883 --> 00:18:43,082
Not to prove anything,

426
00:18:43,082 --> 00:18:43,923
But I didn't manage to

427
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:45,482
To play a game openly.

428
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:46,962
What a pity.

429
00:18:46,962 --> 00:18:48,043
Tear up the championship certificate.

430
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,803
You think you're a hero?

431
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:53,283
You won the game with your help.

432
00:18:54,283 --> 00:18:56,122
The players of Ning Jiang lost face.

433
00:18:56,442 --> 00:18:57,482
I just want to

434
00:18:57,482 --> 00:18:59,122
The players of Ning Jiang crossing the line of fire.

435
00:18:59,523 --> 00:19:00,602
Clean the door.

436
00:19:00,883 --> 00:19:01,923
I can promise you

437
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:03,202
But I have a condition.

438
00:19:03,563 --> 00:19:04,962
If you lose,

439
00:19:04,962 --> 00:19:07,842
You will never touch the crossfire line again.

440
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:09,403
How is it, Xiao Feng?

441
00:19:09,923 --> 00:19:10,763
How dare you?

442
00:19:12,322 --> 00:19:12,962
good

443
00:19:14,082 --> 00:19:14,803
machine

444
00:19:15,163 --> 00:19:15,883
place

445
00:19:16,202 --> 00:19:16,883
time

446
00:19:17,283 --> 00:19:17,923
It's up to you.

447
00:19:18,082 --> 00:19:19,003
Right now.

448
00:19:19,602 --> 00:19:21,082
Many people came today.

449
00:19:21,883 --> 00:19:23,962
I'll record them all.

450
00:19:26,202 --> 00:19:27,883
Please give us a witness.

451
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:29,362
good

452
00:19:34,722 --> 00:19:35,763
Are you crazy?

453
00:19:35,923 --> 00:19:37,122
I know you want to be honest.

454
00:19:37,122 --> 00:19:38,523
Defeat the double team.

455
00:19:38,842 --> 00:19:39,482
but

456
00:19:39,962 --> 00:19:41,163
Have you ever thought about

457
00:19:41,163 --> 00:19:42,442
What if you lose?

458
00:19:42,722 --> 00:19:43,842
I've thought about it.

459
00:19:44,482 --> 00:19:45,322
If you lose,

460
00:19:45,763 --> 00:19:47,122
We don't need the competition committee.

461
00:19:47,322 --> 00:19:48,643
We will be sentenced to death.

462
00:19:48,643 --> 00:19:50,082
You promised them

463
00:19:50,403 --> 00:19:51,763
It's not all because of you.

464
00:19:52,523 --> 00:19:53,883
If we don't fight like this,

465
00:19:53,883 --> 00:19:55,683
We won't be able to fight.

466
00:19:57,602 --> 00:19:58,403
Xu Wei.

467
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:01,242
You should be a man first.

468
00:20:03,842 --> 00:20:05,803
This is just Xu Wei's personal behavior.

469
00:20:05,803 --> 00:20:07,442
The other players didn't know it.

470
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:09,643
And after we know the situation,

471
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:10,482
Is the first time

472
00:20:10,482 --> 00:20:12,242
So I told the match committee.

473
00:20:12,362 --> 00:20:13,523
So I hope the committee

474
00:20:13,523 --> 00:20:14,842
According to the actual situation,

475
00:20:14,842 --> 00:20:15,803
With a light sentence.

476
00:20:17,243 --> 00:20:18,882
The committee has been issuing repeated orders.

477
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:20,043
It's not allowed to use external.

478
00:20:20,043 --> 00:20:21,682
If this behavior is tolerated,

479
00:20:21,963 --> 00:20:23,882
Is very unfair to the other teams.

480
00:20:25,402 --> 00:20:26,523
The members of our team

481
00:20:26,523 --> 00:20:28,043
You're not young anymore.

482
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:30,322
And the oldest is already 25 years old.

483
00:20:30,443 --> 00:20:31,483
This could be them.

484
00:20:31,483 --> 00:20:33,443
For the last time.

485
00:20:33,882 --> 00:20:35,922
If we ban all five of them,

486
00:20:35,922 --> 00:20:37,523
For those who don't know,

487
00:20:37,523 --> 00:20:38,602
Is also unfair.

488
00:20:38,803 --> 00:20:41,402
Do you have evidence that the other players didn't know?

489
00:20:42,922 --> 00:20:44,523
Here is a sports reporter

490
00:20:44,523 --> 00:20:45,842
The recording of the interview.

491
00:20:46,402 --> 00:20:47,763
You can listen to it.

492
00:20:50,003 --> 00:20:54,122
Double Battle Team.

493
00:20:54,122 --> 00:21:04,443
Cheating, cheating and cheating.

494
00:21:11,243 --> 00:21:11,922
Xiao Feng.

495
00:21:12,162 --> 00:21:13,723
Which map do you want to die on?

496
00:21:13,922 --> 00:21:16,082
We played satellite base in the semi-finals.

497
00:21:16,682 --> 00:21:18,682
How about this one? We're playing satellite base.

498
00:21:19,003 --> 00:21:20,082
Think it through.

499
00:21:20,882 --> 00:21:23,082
This is the last map you can type.

500
00:21:24,203 --> 00:21:25,763
So I'll play it seriously.

501
00:21:26,003 --> 00:21:28,523
How dare a liar who cheats!

502
00:21:28,882 --> 00:21:29,723
Scum

503
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:45,122
Get out of Ning River.

504
00:21:51,963 --> 00:21:52,642
The middle road.

505
00:21:52,642 --> 00:21:53,963
Go for A.

506
00:21:54,682 --> 00:21:55,563
And the Kirin.

507
00:21:59,003 --> 00:22:00,682
Seal the smoke.

508
00:22:03,283 --> 00:22:04,803
He's dead in the middle.

509
00:22:08,642 --> 00:22:09,283
pretty

510
00:22:09,283 --> 00:22:09,963
There's another one.

511
00:22:14,842 --> 00:22:15,402
We're home.

512
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:16,362
Behind the wall.

513
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:23,922
It's exposed.

514
00:22:24,003 --> 00:22:25,922
The Double Battle Team shaved their heads.

515
00:22:29,122 --> 00:22:30,483
Next, you go to the middle with me.

516
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:31,082
Unicorn

517
00:22:31,082 --> 00:22:31,882
Go to the captain's position.

518
00:22:31,882 --> 00:22:32,443
good

519
00:22:32,443 --> 00:22:33,283
Focus on Gate A.

520
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:45,723
I'll kill one.

521
00:22:45,723 --> 00:22:46,122
good

522
00:22:46,483 --> 00:22:47,483
I saw it.

523
00:22:47,483 --> 00:22:48,003
Point B.

524
00:22:48,003 --> 00:22:49,963
It's a lot B.

525
00:22:49,963 --> 00:22:51,523
Up, up.

526
00:22:51,523 --> 00:22:54,043
Beat him up. Hit him.

527
00:22:55,003 --> 00:22:55,842
One is missing.

528
00:22:56,003 --> 00:22:57,402
Seal the smoke.

529
00:23:00,203 --> 00:23:01,283
Don't fight hard.

530
00:23:01,443 --> 00:23:02,322
I'll cover you.

531
00:23:02,322 --> 00:23:03,322
I'm charging you. Don't charge.

532
00:23:06,443 --> 00:23:07,082
It will fall off at 9: 00.

533
00:23:07,082 --> 00:23:07,922
I'm dead. It's nine o'clock.

534
00:23:07,922 --> 00:23:08,842
I'm coming.

535
00:23:14,922 --> 00:23:16,162
To protect Xiao Feng Kirin.

536
00:23:18,642 --> 00:23:19,443
It's all right.

537
00:23:19,443 --> 00:23:20,362
Be steady.

538
00:23:20,362 --> 00:23:21,203
Go straight to A.

539
00:23:21,203 --> 00:23:21,723
Point A.

540
00:23:25,602 --> 00:23:26,563
Cover the front.

541
00:23:26,882 --> 00:23:27,563
Take cover.

542
00:23:33,523 --> 00:23:34,122
pretty

543
00:23:37,803 --> 00:23:38,563
Right, right.

544
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:42,563
pretty

545
00:23:46,563 --> 00:23:48,162
The team is under great pressure.

546
00:23:48,162 --> 00:23:49,763
Is playing a match with the opponent.

547
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:51,763
But this race means nothing to me.

548
00:23:51,922 --> 00:23:52,803
If you lose,

549
00:23:52,803 --> 00:23:53,682
They might be

550
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,203
I won't touch these things again.

551
00:23:55,203 --> 00:23:56,723
But even if I win,

552
00:23:57,082 --> 00:23:58,003
In return,

553
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,402
A few jeers around.

554
00:23:59,803 --> 00:24:01,602
I don't know why they hold on.

555
00:24:01,842 --> 00:24:02,563
Spread out.

556
00:24:02,563 --> 00:24:02,922
well

557
00:24:02,922 --> 00:24:03,723
Got it?

558
00:24:03,723 --> 00:24:04,003
good

559
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,763
Come on.

560
00:24:06,763 --> 00:24:07,402
Kirin, follow me.

561
00:24:07,402 --> 00:24:08,523
Come on. Go.

562
00:24:08,523 --> 00:24:09,563
The sand at the bottom of the building.

563
00:24:09,563 --> 00:24:10,082
Below, below.

564
00:24:11,723 --> 00:24:12,523
Turn around.

565
00:24:15,682 --> 00:24:16,523
Come on

566
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:17,763
Come on

567
00:24:18,243 --> 00:24:19,162
Come on.

568
00:24:19,162 --> 00:24:19,523
Report it.

569
00:24:19,523 --> 00:24:19,922
Unicorn

570
00:24:19,922 --> 00:24:20,563
Cover the middle door.

571
00:24:20,563 --> 00:24:21,203
Cover Xiao Feng.

572
00:24:21,203 --> 00:24:22,082
Old Sha, behind you.

573
00:24:22,082 --> 00:24:23,563
Don't rush too fast, Captain.

574
00:24:27,283 --> 00:24:28,682
Ah Ming! You threw a flash bomb!

575
00:24:28,682 --> 00:24:29,443
I killed him.

576
00:24:29,443 --> 00:24:30,362
It's gone.

577
00:24:30,362 --> 00:24:31,122
Guard your home.

578
00:24:31,122 --> 00:24:32,362
Hurry, there are three people on the middle road.

579
00:24:32,362 --> 00:24:33,283
Beat him up. Hit him.

580
00:24:33,483 --> 00:24:35,003
Go forward. Go ahead.

581
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:43,842
Now?

582
00:24:43,842 --> 00:24:45,963
They tied the score again.

583
00:24:45,963 --> 00:24:47,322
In the next round,

584
00:24:47,322 --> 00:24:48,763
It should be a tiebreaker.

585
00:24:51,642 --> 00:24:52,963
Follow me.

586
00:24:52,963 --> 00:24:54,122
Take cover.

587
00:24:54,122 --> 00:24:54,882
The second floor.

588
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:56,922
Second floor

589
00:24:57,243 --> 00:24:58,162
On the second floor,

590
00:24:58,162 --> 00:24:58,922
Where did you lose it?

591
00:24:59,283 --> 00:24:59,682
Second floor

592
00:25:00,763 --> 00:25:01,882
Trail A, Track A

593
00:25:01,882 --> 00:25:03,203
One is missing.

594
00:25:04,043 --> 00:25:04,642
It fell off.

595
00:25:04,642 --> 00:25:05,362
To Alley A.

596
00:25:05,362 --> 00:25:07,203
The Kirin!

597
00:25:07,362 --> 00:25:08,082
pretty

598
00:25:08,082 --> 00:25:08,563
Right

599
00:25:08,563 --> 00:25:09,443
There are two more.

600
00:25:13,043 --> 00:25:14,402
Beautiful.

601
00:25:14,402 --> 00:25:15,122
Are in the middle.

602
00:25:15,922 --> 00:25:16,723
There are three more.

603
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,763
Kirin, I'm going to the middle.

604
00:25:18,723 --> 00:25:19,362
Hold on.

605
00:25:19,362 --> 00:25:20,122
I saw one.

606
00:25:20,122 --> 00:25:21,082
Don't panic.

607
00:25:21,082 --> 00:25:21,682
The one in the back.

608
00:25:21,682 --> 00:25:22,563
Right, right.

609
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:24,122
Someone is coming.

610
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:24,963
I've seen it.

611
00:25:25,563 --> 00:25:26,842
The Kirin is charging.

612
00:25:27,922 --> 00:25:28,723
Let's go together.

613
00:25:29,243 --> 00:25:30,322
Beat him up. Hit him.

614
00:25:43,283 --> 00:25:43,763
good

615
00:25:45,842 --> 00:25:46,443
pretty

616
00:25:50,963 --> 00:25:51,922
You played well.

617
00:25:52,682 --> 00:25:53,922
I didn't make it to the semi-finals.

618
00:25:54,362 --> 00:25:55,203
It's my regret.

619
00:25:55,203 --> 00:25:57,203
How do you know we're all on point A?

620
00:25:57,642 --> 00:25:58,922
Did you open the perspective again?

621
00:25:59,283 --> 00:26:00,483
Who is cheating?

622
00:26:00,483 --> 00:26:01,523
You can't lose. What's wrong?

623
00:26:01,803 --> 00:26:03,402
Take out the contents of your pocket.

624
00:26:03,402 --> 00:26:04,563
There must be something inside.

625
00:26:05,203 --> 00:26:06,563
I'll show you. Come here.

626
00:26:06,563 --> 00:26:07,443
Come here. I'll show you.

627
00:26:07,443 --> 00:26:09,003
If you're not afraid, let's search.

628
00:26:09,003 --> 00:26:10,443
How dare you?

629
00:26:11,443 --> 00:26:12,763
You picked the place.

630
00:26:12,763 --> 00:26:14,322
You chose the machine.

631
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,322
The troops of the Imperial Army

632
00:26:15,682 --> 00:26:17,043
You won openly.

633
00:26:17,563 --> 00:26:18,563
Almost there.

634
00:26:18,563 --> 00:26:19,443
It's all gone.

635
00:26:45,723 --> 00:26:46,443
Are you looking for me?

636
00:26:47,682 --> 00:26:48,842
I published an article

637
00:26:48,842 --> 00:26:50,642
There's an interview about the team.

638
00:26:50,922 --> 00:26:52,563
I have added some new contents recently.

639
00:26:52,563 --> 00:26:53,922
I want to write a follow-up report.

640
00:26:54,882 --> 00:26:56,203
You mean the previous report?

641
00:26:56,563 --> 00:26:57,523
It's good.

642
00:26:58,243 --> 00:27:00,283
There's no need to do any follow-up reports.

643
00:27:01,082 --> 00:27:02,842
The previous report mainly focused on

644
00:27:02,842 --> 00:27:04,322
The team cheated in the competition.

645
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:05,682
It violates the principle of fairness.

646
00:27:06,203 --> 00:27:07,963
But I think that's too one-sided.

647
00:27:09,243 --> 00:27:10,283
Recently,

648
00:27:10,283 --> 00:27:12,243
I did a follow-up interview with Gangfen Team.

649
00:27:12,523 --> 00:27:14,922
I found that e-sports and track and field

650
00:27:14,922 --> 00:27:16,523
Football and swimming are the same.

651
00:27:16,523 --> 00:27:17,842
Are all competitive sports.

652
00:27:18,043 --> 00:27:20,642
And they are training for the competition.

653
00:27:20,642 --> 00:27:21,602
And in life,

654
00:27:21,602 --> 00:27:22,602
Is also reflecting

655
00:27:22,602 --> 00:27:24,243
The spirit of modern sports

656
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:26,523
It's not like what you think.

657
00:27:26,922 --> 00:27:28,922
As a reporter, I always take it for granted

658
00:27:28,922 --> 00:27:30,402
Looking at them through colored glasses,

659
00:27:30,402 --> 00:27:31,842
Not to mention the whole society.

660
00:27:32,642 --> 00:27:33,322
therefore

661
00:27:33,322 --> 00:27:35,443
I want to write a more objective report for them.

662
00:27:36,642 --> 00:27:38,922
You're too moderate.

663
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:40,362
To be honest with you,

664
00:27:40,362 --> 00:27:41,003
I still think

665
00:27:41,003 --> 00:27:42,602
Your previous report was more sharp.

666
00:27:42,882 --> 00:27:44,483
But as a journalist,

667
00:27:44,483 --> 00:27:46,523
The first principle is to pursue the objective truth.

668
00:27:46,523 --> 00:27:47,402
Isn't it?

669
00:27:47,602 --> 00:27:48,483
That's right.

670
00:27:49,082 --> 00:27:50,922
But facing those who ignore the rules,

671
00:27:50,922 --> 00:27:52,283
We don't have to be too strict.

672
00:27:52,642 --> 00:27:52,963
I

673
00:27:53,402 --> 00:27:54,362
If there's nothing else,

674
00:27:54,602 --> 00:27:55,523
Just go out.

675
00:27:59,682 --> 00:28:00,682
The result of the penalty has come out.

676
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:06,483
After investigation,

677
00:28:06,483 --> 00:28:08,003
Xu Wei, player of Gangfen Team,

678
00:28:08,003 --> 00:28:09,882
At the Crossfire National Challenge,

679
00:28:09,882 --> 00:28:11,723
In the semi-finals of Ningjiang Division,

680
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:13,803
There is a violation of using the plug-in.

681
00:28:13,803 --> 00:28:15,362
Seriously violated the rules of the tournament.

682
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:17,162
And destroyed the fairness of the competition.

683
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:18,402
Caused a bad influence.

684
00:28:18,402 --> 00:28:20,682
Considering the rest of the team didn't know about it,

685
00:28:20,682 --> 00:28:22,963
And the player admitted the mistake.

686
00:28:22,963 --> 00:28:24,243
According to the rules,

687
00:28:24,243 --> 00:28:26,243
The penalties for players and teams are as follows

688
00:28:26,243 --> 00:28:27,602
Cancel the team.

689
00:28:27,602 --> 00:28:29,763
The champion of Ningjiang Division.

690
00:28:29,763 --> 00:28:30,402
And participate in

691
00:28:30,402 --> 00:28:33,082
Crossing the Fire National Challenge is qualified.

692
00:28:33,082 --> 00:28:36,162
Xu Wei will be banned for five matches.

693
00:28:36,602 --> 00:28:37,402
Finished

694
00:28:37,642 --> 00:28:38,803
The rest are all dead.

695
00:28:38,922 --> 00:28:40,563
He didn't ban our whole team.

696
00:28:40,563 --> 00:28:41,682
I'm already showing mercy.

697
00:28:41,682 --> 00:28:42,763
There's another one.

698
00:28:43,483 --> 00:28:45,283
Because the scale of the competition

699
00:28:45,283 --> 00:28:46,362
Beyond my expectation.

700
00:28:46,362 --> 00:28:47,203
Eleven divisions.

701
00:28:47,203 --> 00:28:48,763
There are eleven teams qualified.

702
00:28:48,763 --> 00:28:50,082
To participate in the National Challenge.

703
00:28:50,082 --> 00:28:52,283
In order to make the final run smoothly,

704
00:28:52,283 --> 00:28:53,443
To set up the Hell Team.

705
00:28:53,682 --> 00:28:55,723
The second ranked team of each division

706
00:28:55,723 --> 00:28:56,803
Sign up for the competition.

707
00:28:56,803 --> 00:28:57,602
The final winner.

708
00:28:57,602 --> 00:28:59,523
And become the 12th team.

709
00:29:00,723 --> 00:29:01,602
The Inferno.

710
00:29:01,602 --> 00:29:02,322
That means

711
00:29:02,322 --> 00:29:04,162
Eleven teams will compete.

712
00:29:04,162 --> 00:29:06,322
Only one team can win.

713
00:29:06,322 --> 00:29:07,963
That's too cruel.

714
00:29:08,082 --> 00:29:09,362
What's more cruel is that

715
00:29:09,362 --> 00:29:11,043
These teams have been eliminated.

716
00:29:11,043 --> 00:29:13,082
A group of hungry ghosts fight for a bite.

717
00:29:13,443 --> 00:29:14,842
No wonder it's called Hell Match.

718
00:29:15,203 --> 00:29:16,402
But I'm fine.

719
00:29:16,402 --> 00:29:17,682
There will always be a solution.

720
00:29:17,842 --> 00:29:19,443
As long as God keeps us alive,

721
00:29:19,803 --> 00:29:21,003
There must be a plan.

722
00:29:22,322 --> 00:29:23,803
But there are two problems.

723
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,162
The competition is voluntary.

724
00:29:26,162 --> 00:29:28,443
So the committee won't bear any cost.

725
00:29:28,763 --> 00:29:30,402
We have to pay for food and accommodation.

726
00:29:33,283 --> 00:29:33,963
The second one?

727
00:29:35,443 --> 00:29:37,322
Xu Wei was banned for five matches.

728
00:29:37,322 --> 00:29:39,523
He can't attend the first five rounds of Hell.

729
00:29:39,803 --> 00:29:40,642
We still need someone.

730
00:29:45,322 --> 00:29:46,003
Where is he?

731
00:30:03,642 --> 00:30:04,763
The result of the penalty has been obtained.

732
00:30:06,842 --> 00:30:07,483
I know.

733
00:30:09,523 --> 00:30:10,763
Although it's not good,

734
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:12,483
But it's not that bad.

735
00:30:13,483 --> 00:30:14,602
Isn't it bad enough?

736
00:30:17,963 --> 00:30:19,402
Since God let us live,

737
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:21,003
There must be a reason for us to live.

738
00:30:21,283 --> 00:30:22,922
Just like you didn't take the umbrella today.

739
00:30:23,203 --> 00:30:24,882
I'm here to give you an umbrella.

740
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:28,922
Lieutenant

741
00:30:29,882 --> 00:30:31,203
You have suffered a lot.

742
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:32,922
I asked for it.

743
00:30:34,563 --> 00:30:35,322
I know.

744
00:30:36,122 --> 00:30:36,922
It's not easy for you.

745
00:30:37,723 --> 00:30:38,763
But don't worry.

746
00:30:39,443 --> 00:30:40,682
Everything will be fine.

747
00:30:42,963 --> 00:30:43,842
Xiao Feng.

748
00:30:46,882 --> 00:30:47,642
to speak the truth

749
00:30:48,362 --> 00:30:49,122
I'm kind of...

750
00:30:50,003 --> 00:30:51,162
I can't hold on.

751
00:30:54,362 --> 00:30:55,483
Me too.

752
00:30:56,043 --> 00:30:57,122
The Inferno.

753
00:30:57,443 --> 00:30:59,122
The word hell is not called for nothing.

754
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,523
You have to eat, wear and live on your own.

755
00:31:01,642 --> 00:31:02,963
Eleven teams.

756
00:31:03,243 --> 00:31:04,642
For a week.

757
00:31:04,642 --> 00:31:05,922
So that a team can advance.

758
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,402
If you lose, you have to get lost.

759
00:31:08,563 --> 00:31:08,882
Leave me alone.

760
00:31:08,882 --> 00:31:10,402
I have no reason to stick to it.

761
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:12,682
Even if we survive,

762
00:31:13,003 --> 00:31:14,402
We'll be waiting for

763
00:31:14,402 --> 00:31:15,483
What could it be?

764
00:31:16,402 --> 00:31:17,682
When will it stop?

765
00:31:18,523 --> 00:31:19,803
May never have a head.

766
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,082
Forget about the past.

767
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:26,563
You have to look forward when you're alive.

768
00:31:30,642 --> 00:31:31,483
You're right.

769
00:31:32,003 --> 00:31:32,763
alive

770
00:31:33,082 --> 00:31:34,362
You have to move on.

771
00:31:44,443 --> 00:31:45,082
Hold on.

772
00:31:45,602 --> 00:31:46,402
What's wrong with this injury?

773
00:31:47,003 --> 00:31:47,362
Nothing

774
00:31:47,362 --> 00:31:47,763
Don't move.

775
00:31:47,763 --> 00:31:48,203
Don't.

776
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:49,362
It's okay.

777
00:31:49,362 --> 00:31:50,043
It's fine.

778
00:31:50,043 --> 00:31:50,803
I've recovered.

779
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,243
You're so badly injured.

780
00:31:53,642 --> 00:31:54,162
When did you get hurt?

781
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,162
I don't know.

782
00:31:56,882 --> 00:31:58,043
It's been months.

783
00:31:58,322 --> 00:31:59,842
For months.

784
00:32:00,922 --> 00:32:02,162
In the divisional round.

785
00:32:03,003 --> 00:32:03,602
No

786
00:32:04,443 --> 00:32:06,283
I cut it by accident.

787
00:32:31,043 --> 00:32:32,642
How is your team?

788
00:32:33,283 --> 00:32:35,162
We have stepped into hell.

789
00:32:37,283 --> 00:32:38,642
It's time to play Hell.

790
00:32:39,043 --> 00:32:39,922
The competition.

791
00:32:39,922 --> 00:32:41,443
Started from that year.

792
00:32:42,483 --> 00:32:43,203
Don't worry.

793
00:32:43,523 --> 00:32:45,043
The Gangfen Army will definitely break through.

794
00:32:46,322 --> 00:32:47,003
You...

795
00:32:47,082 --> 00:32:48,842
Don't give me any more spoilers.

796
00:32:49,122 --> 00:32:50,082
I found that

797
00:32:50,243 --> 00:32:52,082
As long as I know the result in advance,

798
00:32:52,082 --> 00:32:53,763
It's a torture.

799
00:32:54,203 --> 00:32:55,443
Because you have no idea

800
00:32:55,443 --> 00:32:57,162
How can we achieve that result?

801
00:32:57,682 --> 00:32:59,523
What you should suffer.

802
00:32:59,523 --> 00:33:00,842
You can't save a bit.

803
00:33:01,682 --> 00:33:03,082
I thought you were looking for me.

804
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:04,483
You want to ask about the next thing?

805
00:33:04,963 --> 00:33:06,642
Leave me some suspense.

806
00:33:06,882 --> 00:33:08,082
The process is also important.

807
00:33:08,602 --> 00:33:10,642
I have nothing to ask you today.

808
00:33:10,642 --> 00:33:11,723
I just want to talk to you.

809
00:33:12,483 --> 00:33:13,842
I went to your house the other day.

810
00:33:13,963 --> 00:33:15,443
You're taking a rest at home.

811
00:33:17,402 --> 00:33:18,322
I remember.

812
00:33:18,682 --> 00:33:20,243
That was the hardest time.

813
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,162
I can't sleep at night.

814
00:33:26,602 --> 00:33:27,682
I have nightmares during the day.

815
00:33:29,082 --> 00:33:30,283
Every day I think

816
00:33:31,602 --> 00:33:32,723
If I don't follow him,

817
00:33:34,523 --> 00:33:35,922
If I let him wear the helmet,

818
00:33:38,243 --> 00:33:39,322
Now I understand that

819
00:33:41,122 --> 00:33:42,122
There are some things

820
00:33:43,162 --> 00:33:44,082
Is doomed.

821
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:47,842
No matter how hard we struggle,

822
00:33:49,082 --> 00:33:50,003
It's all in vain.

823
00:33:52,402 --> 00:33:53,402
Can't be changed.

824
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,922
Your brother doesn't want you to be unable to get out.

825
00:34:00,243 --> 00:34:01,162
When you're free,

826
00:34:01,922 --> 00:34:02,602
Please tell her.

827
00:34:02,602 --> 00:34:03,723
Lu Xiabei in 2009.

828
00:34:04,362 --> 00:34:05,602
Don't be such a coward.

829
00:34:06,162 --> 00:34:07,162
Accept the reality.

830
00:34:07,523 --> 00:34:08,763
It's no trouble at all.

831
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:10,203
Don't bother me.

832
00:34:13,322 --> 00:34:14,043
You know,

833
00:34:14,483 --> 00:34:16,043
Are we really friends?

834
00:34:16,122 --> 00:34:17,283
We've already met.

835
00:34:17,483 --> 00:34:18,322
You are my friend.

836
00:34:19,283 --> 00:34:21,402
We met at this time.

837
00:34:22,082 --> 00:34:23,922
When I was with you?

838
00:34:24,243 --> 00:34:25,122
I've been looking for you.

839
00:34:25,443 --> 00:34:26,243
But I didn't find it.

840
00:34:26,882 --> 00:34:28,082
I suspected that

841
00:34:28,322 --> 00:34:29,443
Did you cause trouble?

842
00:34:29,723 --> 00:34:31,122
What can I do?

843
00:34:31,122 --> 00:34:32,322
I must have made a fortune.

844
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:33,362
To enjoy my life.

845
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,243
You can't find me.

846
00:34:40,243 --> 00:34:41,322
Help me find someone.

847
00:34:41,682 --> 00:34:42,842
Ask her how she's doing.

848
00:34:43,842 --> 00:34:44,483
a row

849
00:34:44,763 --> 00:34:45,443
Who are you looking for?

850
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:47,043
Her name is...

851
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:47,842
AnLuan

852
00:34:47,842 --> 00:34:48,922
I'll tell you her phone number.

853
00:34:50,082 --> 00:34:52,122
One, three, eight.

854
00:34:52,162 --> 00:34:53,922
Zero three.

855
00:34:53,922 --> 00:34:57,563
Zero three nine nine nine six.

856
00:34:58,483 --> 00:34:59,243
A woman?

857
00:35:00,243 --> 00:35:01,283
What's her relationship with you?

858
00:35:04,082 --> 00:35:05,922
Has something to do with it.

859
00:35:07,642 --> 00:35:08,322
a row

860
00:35:09,043 --> 00:35:10,162
What do you want to ask her?

861
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:11,642
Just ask her.

862
00:35:13,162 --> 00:35:14,563
How are you doing now?

863
00:35:16,922 --> 00:35:17,963
What are you doing?

864
00:35:18,563 --> 00:35:19,322
Also

865
00:35:21,082 --> 00:35:22,003
Are you married?

866
00:35:23,283 --> 00:35:24,602
I want to see which unlucky guy.

867
00:35:24,602 --> 00:35:25,803
To marry her.

868
00:35:27,243 --> 00:35:28,203
What if she gets married?

869
00:35:28,882 --> 00:35:29,882
It has nothing to do with me.

870
00:36:12,723 --> 00:36:13,642
Hello, hello.

871
00:36:14,003 --> 00:36:15,682
I'm looking for Director An Lan.

872
00:36:16,362 --> 00:36:18,203
Hello, who are you?

873
00:36:18,283 --> 00:36:19,322
I'm

874
00:36:19,322 --> 00:36:22,203
The reporter who interviewed her last week, Wang Fan.

875
00:36:22,723 --> 00:36:23,803
I have a few questions.

876
00:36:23,803 --> 00:36:24,763
I didn't ask her.

877
00:36:24,763 --> 00:36:26,882
So I want to ask Director An to confirm it.

878
00:36:26,882 --> 00:36:28,283
But I can't get through to her.

879
00:36:28,283 --> 00:36:29,723
therefore

880
00:36:29,723 --> 00:36:31,483
Could you please transfer it?

881
00:36:32,203 --> 00:36:33,723
Okay, please wait a moment.

882
00:36:33,723 --> 00:36:34,243
Thank you

883
00:36:34,882 --> 00:36:36,043
President An's phone number.

884
00:36:37,763 --> 00:36:38,642
Hello, this is An Lan.

885
00:36:38,642 --> 00:36:39,682
Why are you here?

886
00:36:40,203 --> 00:36:41,122
You don't know me.

887
00:36:41,602 --> 00:36:42,322
I...

888
00:36:42,922 --> 00:36:44,043
I just want to ask you

889
00:36:44,483 --> 00:36:45,243
That

890
00:36:45,882 --> 00:36:46,523
you

891
00:36:47,882 --> 00:36:49,003
Are you married?

892
00:36:49,003 --> 00:36:50,082
Neuropathy

893
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:51,483
Don't hang up.

894
00:36:51,483 --> 00:36:52,723
This is not a harassing call.

895
00:36:52,723 --> 00:36:53,523
I

896
00:36:53,922 --> 00:36:55,283
I just want to ask you.

897
00:36:55,602 --> 00:36:56,122
Are you married?

898
00:36:56,122 --> 00:36:56,763
Or there's

899
00:36:56,922 --> 00:36:57,963
I didn't have time to answer.

900
00:36:57,963 --> 00:36:59,122
Your boring questions

901
00:37:03,443 --> 00:37:04,362
Don't ever let me

902
00:37:04,362 --> 00:37:05,803
To answer these boring calls.

903
00:37:06,162 --> 00:37:06,882
OK

904
00:37:11,443 --> 00:37:13,402
President An, the meeting room has been arranged.

905
00:37:13,402 --> 00:37:14,723
Have you sent the budget proposal?

906
00:37:14,723 --> 00:37:15,842
I think he sent it.

907
00:37:16,402 --> 00:37:17,203
Don't tell me.

908
00:37:17,203 --> 00:37:18,563
It seems possible.

909
00:37:18,563 --> 00:37:19,802
The information I want to confirm

910
00:37:20,043 --> 00:37:21,043
Okay, I know

911
00:37:21,043 --> 00:37:22,003
Sorry, President An.

912
00:37:31,642 --> 00:37:32,242
Are you free?

913
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:33,443
Come in.

914
00:37:34,282 --> 00:37:35,483
Dear President An,

915
00:37:35,682 --> 00:37:37,883
Now, all the departments have

916
00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:39,162
A lot of complaints.

917
00:37:39,282 --> 00:37:40,202
You know that, right?

918
00:37:40,762 --> 00:37:41,443
I heard that

919
00:37:41,443 --> 00:37:42,403
Everyone thinks

920
00:37:42,403 --> 00:37:44,523
Now we are expanding the influence of e-sports.

921
00:37:44,523 --> 00:37:45,403
The best time.

922
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:48,003
But you have eight points out of the whole budget.

923
00:37:48,003 --> 00:37:50,282
In the training of retired athletes.

924
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:51,282
to speak the truth

925
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,963
As the brand manager,

926
00:37:52,963 --> 00:37:54,122
I'm under a lot of pressure.

927
00:37:54,363 --> 00:37:56,843
But e-sports is not short of influence now.

928
00:37:57,242 --> 00:37:59,082
The healthy development of an industry.

929
00:37:59,082 --> 00:38:00,963
To see if we can cultivate new talents.

930
00:38:00,963 --> 00:38:02,682
Can you take care of the retired players?

931
00:38:02,682 --> 00:38:04,403
This is the vitality of the industry.

932
00:38:04,722 --> 00:38:06,242
Is the power of long-term development.

933
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,242
I understand that.

934
00:38:07,483 --> 00:38:08,682
Eleven years ago,

935
00:38:08,963 --> 00:38:11,162
I'm crazy about the e-sports industry.

936
00:38:12,963 --> 00:38:14,443
Then you and the Steel Coin Team

937
00:38:14,443 --> 00:38:15,602
Changed my opinion.

938
00:38:16,323 --> 00:38:17,602
I'm working in ES.

939
00:38:17,602 --> 00:38:19,242
I hope I can change.

940
00:38:19,242 --> 00:38:21,242
People like me who wear colored glasses

941
00:38:22,722 --> 00:38:24,602
I really hope that the industry

942
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,242
To have a better development.

943
00:38:27,323 --> 00:38:28,642
But until today,

944
00:38:28,802 --> 00:38:30,963
Many people treat e-sports as business.

945
00:38:31,162 --> 00:38:32,122
Don't worry.

946
00:38:32,122 --> 00:38:34,043
I'm here to tell you that

947
00:38:34,043 --> 00:38:35,443
No matter who the company is,

948
00:38:35,443 --> 00:38:36,682
Are opposed to the budget adjustment.

949
00:38:36,883 --> 00:38:38,082
I will still support you.

950
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:39,122
therefore

951
00:38:39,122 --> 00:38:39,883
Come on

952
00:38:43,642 --> 00:38:44,802
Go on. The team is here.

953
00:38:44,802 --> 00:38:45,722
Go on. The team is here.

954
00:38:53,323 --> 00:38:57,963
King King

955
00:38:59,523 --> 00:39:00,282
congratulations

956
00:39:00,523 --> 00:39:02,363
You can book the tickets to Shenzhen in advance.

957
00:39:02,843 --> 00:39:04,122
The game hasn't finished yet.

958
00:39:04,122 --> 00:39:05,202
It's a bit early.

959
00:39:05,202 --> 00:39:06,242
Lost to Langya.

960
00:39:06,843 --> 00:39:08,242
You will be promoted to the semi-professional league.

961
00:39:08,443 --> 00:39:09,403
Why should I lose?

962
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:10,323
Because I lost,

963
00:39:10,323 --> 00:39:11,642
You can avoid me.

964
00:39:12,403 --> 00:39:13,363
And won.

965
00:39:13,682 --> 00:39:15,082
Who qualified with you.

966
00:39:15,082 --> 00:39:16,122
We will continue to be a team.

967
00:39:16,762 --> 00:39:17,722
You lost, Langya.

968
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:18,602
You can be with Langya.

969
00:39:18,602 --> 00:39:19,602
Go hand in hand with semi-league.

970
00:39:20,043 --> 00:39:21,403
Let a weak team advance.

971
00:39:21,963 --> 00:39:23,883
It's more likely to win the championship in the future.

972
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:25,043
Smarty Pants

973
00:39:25,883 --> 00:39:26,883
Would do that.

974
00:39:27,403 --> 00:39:28,602
That's the choice of the weak.

975
00:39:29,443 --> 00:39:30,202
It's not me.

976
00:39:30,483 --> 00:39:34,843
King, come on.

977
00:39:41,403 --> 00:39:42,762
How are we going to fight today?

978
00:39:43,202 --> 00:39:44,323
Didn't you decorate it yesterday?

979
00:39:44,323 --> 00:39:46,122
I actually think Lu Xiao Bei is right.

980
00:39:46,122 --> 00:39:48,282
We don't have to fight with the Langya League.

981
00:39:48,642 --> 00:39:49,282
Namely

982
00:39:49,443 --> 00:39:51,642
Whether we win or lose, we are sure to be qualified.

983
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:53,682
You can be shameless.

984
00:39:54,043 --> 00:39:54,762
I want to...

985
00:39:55,443 --> 00:39:56,483
We must win this.

986
00:39:56,682 --> 00:39:58,642
You're so irritating.

987
00:39:58,642 --> 00:40:00,363
King will definitely fight with his life.

988
00:40:09,523 --> 00:40:10,323
BK them.

989
00:40:10,323 --> 00:40:12,242
I'm really bad at defending and reshooting.

990
00:40:12,883 --> 00:40:15,122
We just need to play our coordination and synchronization.

991
00:40:15,642 --> 00:40:17,043
Taking them down is not a problem.

992
00:40:17,563 --> 00:40:18,282
Go on.

993
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:19,523
And wins.

994
00:40:19,802 --> 00:40:21,642
Welcome, teachers and students.

995
00:40:21,642 --> 00:40:24,242
二零二零年全国中学生运动会

996
00:40:24,443 --> 00:40:26,642
With a different style and fighting spirit.

997
00:40:26,642 --> 00:40:28,563
It's a scorching sun.

998
00:40:28,563 --> 00:40:30,802
Because of your passion and dream,

999
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:33,642
Let's welcome the athletes with applause.

1000
00:40:33,642 --> 00:40:34,722
admission

1001
00:40:34,722 --> 00:40:35,722
They are all the schools.

1002
00:40:35,722 --> 00:40:37,762
The winner of the women's 100m sprint.

1003
00:40:37,762 --> 00:40:39,202
First, the number one player.

1004
00:40:39,202 --> 00:40:41,282
Liu Ling from Guanghua High School.

1005
00:40:41,282 --> 00:40:44,003
The second contestant is Lin Ke from Foreign Language High School.

1006
00:40:44,003 --> 00:40:45,802
If you can't get the ranking this time,

1007
00:40:45,802 --> 00:40:46,843
Even the walk is hanging.

1008
00:40:47,523 --> 00:40:49,043
I won't let you go to college.

1009
00:40:49,043 --> 00:40:50,682
Your father was killed by you.

1010
00:40:51,122 --> 00:40:52,323
The sixth player.

1011
00:40:52,323 --> 00:40:54,122
Yang Fenfen from Nanyuan High School.

1012
00:40:54,642 --> 00:40:56,722
The 7th player, Ning Jiang High School.

1013
00:40:56,722 --> 00:40:57,762
Chu song

1014
00:40:59,202 --> 00:41:00,162
The eighth player.

1015
00:41:00,323 --> 00:41:01,323
Experimental High School.

1016
00:41:01,323 --> 00:41:02,082
Zhang Fen

1017
00:41:07,162 --> 00:41:08,403
Put it on and run faster.

1018
00:41:09,122 --> 00:41:10,363
Don't let others catch up with you.

1019
00:41:18,523 --> 00:41:19,843
One of them went to Grade A.

1020
00:41:19,843 --> 00:41:20,642
Received, received.

1021
00:41:21,923 --> 00:41:22,483
to fix

1022
00:41:22,483 --> 00:41:23,122
pretty

1023
00:41:23,122 --> 00:41:23,762
Nice gun.

1024
00:41:23,762 --> 00:41:25,043
Hold on. Play like this.

1025
00:41:26,282 --> 00:41:29,122
The scores of the top three are very subtle.

1026
00:41:29,843 --> 00:41:31,242
The Strider Langfang and the Continuation Team

1027
00:41:31,242 --> 00:41:32,682
Are playing the last round.

1028
00:41:33,122 --> 00:41:35,082
If the Striders defeat the Langya,

1029
00:41:35,082 --> 00:41:36,682
If the team beats BK,

1030
00:41:37,602 --> 00:41:40,122
The team will get the same points as Langya.

1031
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:41,242
But according to the outcome,

1032
00:41:41,242 --> 00:41:43,162
If we continue to fight, we can defeat Langya.

1033
00:41:43,162 --> 00:41:44,762
To get the second place.

1034
00:41:44,762 --> 00:41:46,403
It's a foregone conclusion.

1035
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:47,563
The gods have King.

1036
00:41:47,883 --> 00:41:49,282
You are sure to win.

1037
00:41:49,802 --> 00:41:51,443
It's easier on the team.

1038
00:41:51,443 --> 00:41:53,003
We'll win the game soon.

1039
00:41:53,003 --> 00:41:55,162
BK is to give you a question.

1040
00:41:55,162 --> 00:41:57,242
They'll definitely be qualified with the Striders.

1041
00:41:57,883 --> 00:41:59,323
but

1042
00:41:59,323 --> 00:42:01,403
If the Strider loses to Langya,

1043
00:42:01,403 --> 00:42:02,403
You can get it from Langya.

1044
00:42:02,403 --> 00:42:03,923
The first place of Ning Jiang Team.

1045
00:42:03,923 --> 00:42:05,602
If we continue to defeat BK,

1046
00:42:05,602 --> 00:42:06,923
Will be eliminated completely.

1047
00:42:07,963 --> 00:42:09,122
impossible

1048
00:42:09,122 --> 00:42:09,883
Now the cultivator

1049
00:42:09,883 --> 00:42:11,563
Has beaten Langya to 7-2.

1050
00:42:13,523 --> 00:42:14,883
You can't say that.

1051
00:42:15,443 --> 00:42:16,883
The game didn't come to the last minute.

1052
00:42:16,883 --> 00:42:18,403
Anything can happen.

1053
00:42:19,323 --> 00:42:20,082
One off.

1054
00:42:20,082 --> 00:42:21,043
Support, support and support.

1055
00:42:21,043 --> 00:42:21,843
I'm coming.

1056
00:42:22,762 --> 00:42:23,602
Kai, wait for me.

1057
00:42:23,602 --> 00:42:24,443
Alright.

1058
00:42:24,443 --> 00:42:25,282
Three, two, one.

1059
00:42:25,282 --> 00:42:25,802
good

1060
00:42:26,082 --> 00:42:26,682
Get ready

1061
00:42:26,682 --> 00:42:27,323
three

1062
00:42:27,323 --> 00:42:28,082
two

1063
00:42:28,082 --> 00:42:28,602
one

1064
00:42:28,602 --> 00:42:29,202
punching

1065
00:42:30,602 --> 00:42:32,242
pretty

1066
00:42:33,082 --> 00:42:33,883
Small token of kindly feelings

1067
00:42:34,162 --> 00:42:34,762
Let's go and have a look.

1068
00:42:34,762 --> 00:42:35,722
King, their competition.

1069
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:36,363
Let's go.

1070
00:42:38,963 --> 00:42:40,043
Brother Kai.

1071
00:42:45,003 --> 00:42:45,963
Two of you come to the middle.

1072
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:46,843
Seal the cigarette.

1073
00:42:50,602 --> 00:42:51,202
It fell off.

1074
00:42:51,963 --> 00:42:52,883
There's residual blood.

1075
00:42:52,883 --> 00:42:53,642
Stop it.

1076
00:42:57,883 --> 00:42:59,082
Go, go.

1077
00:43:03,363 --> 00:43:04,602
What's going on?

1078
00:43:06,923 --> 00:43:08,082
Did you do it on purpose?

1079
00:43:10,242 --> 00:43:11,722
This is not your normal level.

1080
00:43:12,602 --> 00:43:13,483
You want to release water?

1081
00:43:15,443 --> 00:43:17,043
The cultivator is too blind.

1082
00:43:17,043 --> 00:43:18,642
The good situation is gone.

1083
00:43:29,082 --> 00:43:30,363
If you want to go to the south,

1084
00:43:30,602 --> 00:43:31,483
Do you match?

1085
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:32,843
Even if you did,

1086
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:34,122
You're also the daughter of a murderer.

1087
00:43:34,122 --> 00:43:36,043
Chuge's father is a murderer.

1088
00:43:36,043 --> 00:43:37,403
Her father is a murderer.

1089
00:43:37,403 --> 00:43:38,523
Her father refused to be arrested.

1090
00:43:39,082 --> 00:43:39,923
Haven't you heard of it?

1091
00:43:39,923 --> 00:43:41,602
Can cold-blooded genes be inherited?

1092
00:43:41,602 --> 00:43:43,242
Cold-blooded genes are inherited.

1093
00:43:43,242 --> 00:43:44,563
Why would Ning Jiang High School accept such people?

1094
00:43:58,923 --> 00:44:00,162
I was attacked.

1095
00:44:07,762 --> 00:44:08,682
Hand grenades.

1096
00:44:10,563 --> 00:44:12,003
Pay attention to the thunder.

1097
00:44:19,162 --> 00:44:19,802
Slowly.

1098
00:44:35,242 --> 00:44:35,843
It's over.

1099
00:44:39,682 --> 00:44:40,762
It's all over.

1100
00:44:41,923 --> 00:44:43,363
I know you want to go to the Southern Team.

1101
00:44:43,363 --> 00:44:45,563
But you're not the only one who wants to join the Southern Sports Team.

1102
00:44:45,802 --> 00:44:47,722
If you can't get the ranking this time,

1103
00:44:48,162 --> 00:44:49,602
You even have a walk.

1104
00:44:50,363 --> 00:44:52,162
The cultivator must have discussed with Langya.

1105
00:44:52,162 --> 00:44:53,282
You deliberately killed your team.

1106
00:44:53,282 --> 00:44:54,843
Yes, they must have reached an agreement.

1107
00:44:55,003 --> 00:44:55,883
Xiaobei

1108
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:57,642
These bastards are cheating.

1109
00:44:57,963 --> 00:44:59,043
They didn't cheat.

1110
00:44:59,443 --> 00:45:01,003
They just used the rules properly.

1111
00:45:01,403 --> 00:45:02,602
We can appeal.

1112
00:45:02,843 --> 00:45:04,082
This fool can see it.

1113
00:45:04,082 --> 00:45:05,323
This is a fake competition.

1114
00:45:05,483 --> 00:45:06,483
Do you have any evidence?

1115
00:45:06,642 --> 00:45:07,762
He's in a bad condition.

1116
00:45:07,762 --> 00:45:09,323
Can stop all of us.

1117
00:45:12,003 --> 00:45:13,443
We didn't play well before.

1118
00:45:14,403 --> 00:45:16,202
So I left my fate in the hands of others.

1119
00:45:19,162 --> 00:45:20,483
You deliberately released water.

1120
00:45:20,762 --> 00:45:21,563
Answer me.

1121
00:45:21,563 --> 00:45:22,722
Don't be angry.

1122
00:45:22,722 --> 00:45:24,443
You may be in a bad state today,

1123
00:45:24,443 --> 00:45:25,843
Anyway, we're qualified as the second.

1124
00:45:25,843 --> 00:45:26,363
is or isn't

1125
00:45:26,363 --> 00:45:27,483
That's right.

1126
00:45:28,003 --> 00:45:29,483
Did you discuss it in advance?

1127
00:45:29,762 --> 00:45:30,563
to speak the truth

1128
00:45:30,762 --> 00:45:31,762
We don't need to discuss it.

1129
00:45:32,003 --> 00:45:33,122
To play semi-league in the future.

1130
00:45:33,122 --> 00:45:34,563
We'd rather meet the Langya Alliance.

1131
00:45:34,563 --> 00:45:35,563
As you can see,

1132
00:45:35,563 --> 00:45:37,282
The level of the team continues today.

1133
00:45:37,282 --> 00:45:38,602
Especially Lu Xiabei.

1134
00:46:04,202 --> 00:46:05,162
Okay, next,

1135
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:06,323
Invite Principal Sun

1136
00:46:06,323 --> 00:46:08,282
To award the champion.

1137
00:46:12,162 --> 00:46:13,963
Okay, we can actually see

1138
00:46:13,963 --> 00:46:15,323
In this competition,

1139
00:46:15,323 --> 00:46:16,923
It can be said that every player

1140
00:46:16,923 --> 00:46:19,003
Have made full preparations.

1141
00:46:19,162 --> 00:46:19,722
So,

1142
00:46:19,722 --> 00:46:20,642
They also achieved

1143
00:46:20,642 --> 00:46:22,003
It's a great achievement.

1144
00:46:22,003 --> 00:46:23,323
But I have to say here,

1145
00:46:23,323 --> 00:46:24,483
I hope those who haven't

1146
00:46:24,483 --> 00:46:25,483
A good student.

1147
00:46:25,483 --> 00:46:26,602
Keep working hard.

1148
00:46:26,602 --> 00:46:27,443
Keep up the good work.

1149
00:46:31,802 --> 00:46:34,642
Many students improved a lot in this test.

1150
00:46:34,642 --> 00:46:36,242
A lot of students have retreated.

1151
00:46:36,242 --> 00:46:37,563
Check yourself.

1152
00:46:37,563 --> 00:46:39,642
Make a summary in class tomorrow.

1153
00:46:46,202 --> 00:46:46,682
Class is over

1154
00:47:03,242 --> 00:47:04,082
Lu Xiao Bei,

1155
00:47:04,602 --> 00:47:05,923
Have you seen Chu Ge?

1156
00:47:06,363 --> 00:47:07,282
I'm looking for her.

1157
00:47:07,923 --> 00:47:08,523
What's wrong with her?

1158
00:47:09,523 --> 00:47:10,403
The cleaner

1159
00:47:10,403 --> 00:47:12,003
In the garbage can of the playground.

1160
00:47:12,003 --> 00:47:13,003
I found this.

1161
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:14,602
How could she give such an important thing

1162
00:47:14,602 --> 00:47:15,483
You lost it?
