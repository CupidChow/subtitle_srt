1
00:02:48,976 --> 00:02:49,575
There's something here.

2
00:02:49,575 --> 00:02:50,176
Come here.

3
00:02:58,415 --> 00:02:59,016
Why are you so amazing?

4
00:02:59,016 --> 00:02:59,775
More accurate than the traffic police.

5
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:01,296
There's only one possibility.

6
00:03:01,696 --> 00:03:02,976
Someone from them reported

7
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:03,696
Otherwise, it's impossible.

8
00:03:10,455 --> 00:03:12,455
The gravity broke out in the second round.

9
00:03:12,455 --> 00:03:14,336
Especially the last four or five rounds.

10
00:03:14,616 --> 00:03:16,815
The odds are almost 100%.

11
00:03:17,175 --> 00:03:18,855
And destroyed the team.

12
00:03:18,855 --> 00:03:20,656
This can only be said to be strength and luck.

13
00:03:20,656 --> 00:03:22,336
I feel the defending champion's momentum

14
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:23,415
He's already up.

15
00:03:23,415 --> 00:03:24,455
In the third round,

16
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:26,415
It's very hard to continue the team.

17
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,016
Lu Xiao Bei has to adjust.

18
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,695
I'm the leader of the Continuing Team.

19
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:56,975
I'd like to report it

20
00:03:56,975 --> 00:03:58,496
Gravity, illegal use, cheating.

21
00:03:58,496 --> 00:03:59,856
This is the live video I just shot.

22
00:03:59,856 --> 00:04:00,615
There's always an audience down there.

23
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,815
Sign for them.

24
00:04:01,815 --> 00:04:02,856
With this video,

25
00:04:03,216 --> 00:04:04,576
You can't assume that the other person is cheating.

26
00:04:04,576 --> 00:04:05,735
It's easy to verify.

27
00:04:05,936 --> 00:04:07,216
My video has a timeline.

28
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:09,335
And the surveillance footage of the crime scene.

29
00:04:09,335 --> 00:04:10,615
As long as the player looks up,

30
00:04:10,615 --> 00:04:11,776
I know where our player is.

31
00:04:11,776 --> 00:04:12,656
It's not obvious that

32
00:04:12,656 --> 00:04:13,576
You can put this video

33
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:14,656
To the mailbox of the competition committee.

34
00:04:14,656 --> 00:04:15,735
We'll handle it after the game.

35
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:17,016
But it's too late after the game.

36
00:04:17,255 --> 00:04:18,416
I'm asking now.

37
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,255
Stop the game.

38
00:04:19,255 --> 00:04:20,416
Solve the problem immediately.

39
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:29,936
The navigation is on.

40
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:30,936
Are you still playing the game?

41
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:32,335
Referee, can you control it?

42
00:04:32,335 --> 00:04:32,895
Opposite side

43
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,416
Someone must have reported the opposite gravity.

44
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,735
I didn't receive any notification from the referee.

45
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:37,176
Isn't it obvious?

46
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:38,896
This is not the first time.

47
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:40,456
We've been in the back of the box

48
00:04:40,456 --> 00:04:41,616
Wear it to death.

49
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:43,255
We're questioning the question now.

50
00:04:43,255 --> 00:04:44,176
You're the referee.

51
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:45,855
You should play your role.

52
00:04:45,855 --> 00:04:48,135
If we compare two videos now,

53
00:04:48,135 --> 00:04:49,216
It will be a waste of time.

54
00:04:49,216 --> 00:04:51,095
And now in the competition,

55
00:04:51,095 --> 00:04:51,855
Please understand.

56
00:04:51,855 --> 00:04:53,376
Can you tell me what I should do now?

57
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,295
Please trust us.

58
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:55,535
If there was cheating,

59
00:04:55,535 --> 00:04:56,695
Will be handled seriously.

60
00:04:57,975 --> 00:04:59,776
Please take this matter seriously.

61
00:04:59,776 --> 00:05:00,656
To make sure the game is fair.

62
00:05:00,656 --> 00:05:01,295
Thank you

63
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:04,695
How do you know Lu Xiaobai is going to the middle?

64
00:05:06,496 --> 00:05:07,176
I guessed it.

65
00:05:07,415 --> 00:05:08,736
He did this several times.

66
00:05:08,736 --> 00:05:09,815
Don't be so clever.

67
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:11,975
Don't treat everyone else as a fool.

68
00:05:11,975 --> 00:05:12,656
What do you mean?

69
00:05:13,336 --> 00:05:15,216
Captain, please control your players.

70
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:15,936
Once.

71
00:05:15,936 --> 00:05:17,216
We are within the reasonable range.

72
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,496
Question the fairness of the competition.

73
00:05:18,896 --> 00:05:20,575
I suspect there's a technical foul on the opposite side.

74
00:05:20,575 --> 00:05:21,176
We need to suspend the game.

75
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:21,736
to wait a moment

76
00:05:22,776 --> 00:05:24,295
To strengthen the inspection of the audience.

77
00:05:24,295 --> 00:05:25,695
Don't look down on the stage.

78
00:05:26,056 --> 00:05:26,815
Received the report.

79
00:05:27,255 --> 00:05:28,855
Please continue to play the game.

80
00:05:28,855 --> 00:05:29,776
Don't look off the stage.

81
00:05:29,776 --> 00:05:31,135
Who looked down?

82
00:05:31,135 --> 00:05:31,936
Who are you slandering?

83
00:05:31,936 --> 00:05:32,855
We can see that

84
00:05:32,855 --> 00:05:34,575
The referee is very serious.

85
00:05:34,575 --> 00:05:36,216
What kind of things are you talking about?

86
00:05:36,216 --> 00:05:36,975
You can win.

87
00:05:37,575 --> 00:05:38,456
Be quiet.

88
00:05:38,456 --> 00:05:39,295
Received the report.

89
00:05:39,855 --> 00:05:41,975
In the next competition,

90
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:43,176
Please don't look down.

91
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,015
Thank you for your cooperation.

92
00:05:44,336 --> 00:05:45,656
For the last time,

93
00:05:46,015 --> 00:05:46,936
This is a competition.

94
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,936
It's worse than that.

95
00:05:48,095 --> 00:05:48,656
hope

96
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:49,496
The players from both sides

97
00:05:49,496 --> 00:05:51,376
And calm down.

98
00:05:51,376 --> 00:05:53,336
To prepare for the next game.

99
00:06:01,216 --> 00:06:01,815
It's done.

100
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,255
Captain, how do you play later?

101
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,736
Are we still defending point A?

102
00:06:14,535 --> 00:06:15,376
To the outside.

103
00:06:16,095 --> 00:06:16,776
干他们

104
00:07:01,056 --> 00:07:01,856
Next round.

105
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,215
Change the rifle.

106
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:04,335
Let's play fast attack.

107
00:07:04,496 --> 00:07:05,015
Received

108
00:07:12,936 --> 00:07:13,655
A, two.

109
00:07:13,655 --> 00:07:14,736
A Trail, find the road, north.

110
00:07:14,736 --> 00:07:15,775
I'll outflank him from the middle.

111
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:18,936
There are two people on the North Middle Road.

112
00:07:18,936 --> 00:07:19,815
When we come to help,

113
00:07:49,976 --> 00:07:50,616
A is small.

114
00:07:50,616 --> 00:07:51,736
Go inside.

115
00:08:21,455 --> 00:08:22,056
Xiaobei

116
00:08:23,255 --> 00:08:23,775
Xiaobei

117
00:08:25,455 --> 00:08:26,736
Call a time out and take a rest.

118
00:08:29,296 --> 00:08:29,856
No need

119
00:08:30,695 --> 00:08:31,496
You can continue to play.

120
00:08:32,856 --> 00:08:34,815
Referee, I'm going to the bathroom.

121
00:08:35,255 --> 00:08:36,335
I also applied to use the restroom.

122
00:08:36,335 --> 00:08:37,056
I'll go too.

123
00:08:37,335 --> 00:08:37,976
Let's go together.

124
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,176
You only have one chance to stop.

125
00:08:40,176 --> 00:08:41,215
The time is five minutes.

126
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:42,416
Are you sure you want to use it?

127
00:08:42,695 --> 00:08:43,416
determine

128
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:44,575
Let's go.

129
00:08:45,815 --> 00:08:46,895
go

130
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:50,695
Brothers,

131
00:08:51,176 --> 00:08:52,536
Let's do a spiritual massage.

132
00:08:52,536 --> 00:08:53,335
Relax.

133
00:09:10,976 --> 00:09:11,455
Xiaobei

134
00:09:13,376 --> 00:09:14,015
Xiaobei

135
00:09:16,296 --> 00:09:17,255
You know, for so long,

136
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:18,616
I've always admired you. What?

137
00:09:21,575 --> 00:09:23,296
The best player in the world

138
00:09:23,536 --> 00:09:24,976
Are all in the same team.

139
00:09:27,015 --> 00:09:27,895
therefore

140
00:09:28,376 --> 00:09:29,736
With us by your side,

141
00:09:30,296 --> 00:09:31,536
Just let go of me.

142
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:32,655
As long as we are here,

143
00:09:32,775 --> 00:09:34,135
There's nothing you can't do.

144
00:09:34,496 --> 00:09:35,335
Come on.

145
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:36,215
Kill them.

146
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:36,936
dry

147
00:09:59,976 --> 00:10:00,736
Go on.

148
00:10:01,135 --> 00:10:02,056
And wins.

149
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,496
Start

150
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:31,335
Received

151
00:10:31,575 --> 00:10:32,455
After half time,

152
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,856
The team seems to have made a tactical adjustment.

153
00:10:34,856 --> 00:10:36,575
The team is getting stronger.

154
00:10:36,575 --> 00:10:38,215
I didn't give gravity a chance.

155
00:10:38,215 --> 00:10:39,496
The score is so sharp.

156
00:10:39,496 --> 00:10:41,575
And dragged the gravity into the final.

157
00:10:42,056 --> 00:10:43,616
You can't even beat your head off.

158
00:10:43,616 --> 00:10:44,736
Are you here to be funny?

159
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:45,496
You missed it.

160
00:10:45,496 --> 00:10:46,496
Who are we?

161
00:10:47,895 --> 00:10:49,135
Nine to eight.

162
00:10:49,135 --> 00:10:51,455
I feel the atmosphere is suffocating.

163
00:10:51,455 --> 00:10:53,655
Now the match has come to the third match point.

164
00:10:53,976 --> 00:10:55,815
This is a crucial point.

165
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,496
The team is only one step away from the championship.

166
00:10:58,496 --> 00:10:59,416
To win this point.

167
00:10:59,616 --> 00:11:01,616
They will rewrite history.

168
00:11:01,616 --> 00:11:03,096
Facing Gravity Team,

169
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,576
This is the last chance.

170
00:11:04,775 --> 00:11:05,736
Can you defend your title?

171
00:11:05,895 --> 00:11:08,295
Can we achieve the Triple Crown Dynasty?

172
00:11:08,456 --> 00:11:09,496
It depends on this point.

173
00:11:09,496 --> 00:11:12,415
Who is the strongest king between North and King?

174
00:11:12,496 --> 00:11:14,055
Back in the training camp,

175
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:15,295
Gravity signed King.

176
00:11:15,295 --> 00:11:16,655
But there's no sign, Xiao Bei.

177
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:18,295
Lu Xiao Bei formed his own team.

178
00:11:18,295 --> 00:11:18,856
From Hundred Cities,

179
00:11:18,856 --> 00:11:20,655
To the professional league.

180
00:11:20,655 --> 00:11:21,935
Let's compare the scene

181
00:11:21,935 --> 00:11:24,135
To the upstairs lounge area.

182
00:11:24,135 --> 00:11:25,216
President Xu,

183
00:11:25,216 --> 00:11:27,415
Do you regret your choice?

184
00:11:53,576 --> 00:11:54,015
The road team.

185
00:11:54,295 --> 00:11:55,816
I found it at about 10: 00 a.m.

186
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:56,895
In this pool.

187
00:11:57,336 --> 00:11:58,336
Waiting for the autopsy result.

188
00:11:58,336 --> 00:11:59,535
You can be sure when you come out.

189
00:11:59,535 --> 00:12:01,535
Is he the mechanic who went missing 11 years ago?

190
00:12:01,535 --> 00:12:02,295
This door

191
00:12:02,295 --> 00:12:02,935
We suspect that

192
00:12:02,935 --> 00:12:05,376
Was removed from the car that caused the accident.

193
00:12:12,216 --> 00:12:13,576
They're comfortable in the middle.

194
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,415
The last one will probably be the top defense.

195
00:12:15,895 --> 00:12:16,816
I guess they

196
00:12:17,255 --> 00:12:18,295
Two at A.

197
00:12:18,295 --> 00:12:19,496
King and a guard

198
00:12:19,496 --> 00:12:21,015
The last one is on B.

199
00:12:21,736 --> 00:12:23,736
Point A, the past two, guard back.

200
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,216
Sugar and I are stuck in the middle.

201
00:12:25,216 --> 00:12:25,696
Received

202
00:12:25,856 --> 00:12:26,895
Pass B, there's one.

203
00:12:27,336 --> 00:12:28,535
How are we going to play this round?

204
00:12:29,255 --> 00:12:30,255
Go to the middle and hit B.

205
00:12:31,135 --> 00:12:33,055
Lu Xiao Bei likes to play cards against common sense.

206
00:12:33,055 --> 00:12:34,376
He is likely to go to the middle.

207
00:12:34,376 --> 00:12:35,096
Play B.

208
00:12:35,096 --> 00:12:36,496
They lost at B last time.

209
00:12:36,816 --> 00:12:37,736
This one must be A.

210
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:40,376
This tactic was used in the regular season.

211
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:41,376
But I lost the game.

212
00:12:42,456 --> 00:12:43,775
That's why they can't guess.

213
00:12:44,135 --> 00:12:45,535
How dare we play this tactic?

214
00:12:46,456 --> 00:12:48,255
This is exciting. I like it.

215
00:12:50,415 --> 00:12:51,655
You don't know Lu Xiaobei.

216
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:52,895
I'm the captain.

217
00:12:53,295 --> 00:12:54,096
Listen to me.

218
00:12:55,736 --> 00:12:58,175
And they should be carrying the bag.

219
00:13:01,535 --> 00:13:02,336
I

220
00:13:03,535 --> 00:13:04,736
Su Jiayi.

221
00:13:05,376 --> 00:13:06,816
I'm the only one who didn't hold a bag.

222
00:13:06,816 --> 00:13:07,935
Aren't you afraid that the opposite party

223
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:09,135
What's there to be afraid of?

224
00:13:09,895 --> 00:13:11,736
Wang Kai, go harass the A bag.

225
00:13:11,935 --> 00:13:13,055
Xiangzi, touch the B pass.

226
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:15,775
Nezha and I will cover the S + 1 Middle Route.

227
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:16,496
Received

228
00:13:17,895 --> 00:13:18,336
Kai

229
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:20,415
Don't be emotional.

230
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:23,055
Start

231
00:13:56,935 --> 00:13:58,055
G02, one shot.

232
00:13:58,055 --> 00:13:59,376
And took Cookie away.

233
00:13:59,376 --> 00:14:00,736
101, follow me to A.

234
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:41,655
Okay, keep fighting. Just do it.

235
00:15:41,655 --> 00:15:42,295
Sugar, let's guard the bag.

236
00:15:42,295 --> 00:15:43,055
Hold this bag.

237
00:15:43,055 --> 00:15:43,576
OK

238
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:44,415
Sugar, come to the middle.

239
00:15:44,415 --> 00:15:45,456
Don't go to Point A.

240
00:15:45,456 --> 00:15:46,175
Don't rush me.

241
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,935
We've already won.

242
00:15:46,935 --> 00:15:48,096
They have been replaced.

243
00:15:48,096 --> 00:15:49,175
You don't need so many people.

244
00:16:00,655 --> 00:16:01,135
Zha

245
00:16:01,135 --> 00:16:01,935
If the bag is gone,

246
00:16:02,376 --> 00:16:03,336
Take the bag to point B.

247
00:16:04,216 --> 00:16:04,856
Don't be nervous.

248
00:16:05,415 --> 00:16:06,135
I believe in you.

249
00:16:55,175 --> 00:16:55,696
come back

250
00:16:56,295 --> 00:16:57,336
Their target is here.

251
00:16:57,576 --> 00:16:58,816
You think you're still the captain?

252
00:17:47,255 --> 00:17:48,055
Lu Xiao Bei,

253
00:17:56,015 --> 00:17:57,175
How dare you bet with me?

254
00:18:02,616 --> 00:18:03,295
How dare you?

255
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:07,895
Come on.

256
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:57,336
Wow, there's a lot of smoke.

257
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,415
We can't see anything.

258
00:18:58,696 --> 00:18:59,775
Who lives here?

259
00:18:59,895 --> 00:19:01,055
Will determine the outcome of the competition.

260
00:19:01,055 --> 00:19:02,576
Has a decisive influence.

261
00:19:05,376 --> 00:19:06,015
A gunshot.

262
00:19:06,015 --> 00:19:06,696
Let's have a look.

263
00:19:06,696 --> 00:19:08,415
Who took who?

264
00:19:12,216 --> 00:19:14,456
Nezha took Sugar at the critical moment.

265
00:19:14,456 --> 00:19:15,816
He successfully got C4.

266
00:19:15,816 --> 00:19:17,096
Now it's two to one.

267
00:19:17,096 --> 00:19:18,376
The advantage of the team is great.

268
00:19:18,376 --> 00:19:19,496
The scale of victory is finally

269
00:19:19,496 --> 00:19:21,415
Begin to lean towards the Continuing Team.

270
00:19:55,776 --> 00:19:56,455
captain

271
00:20:40,135 --> 00:20:41,256
I can't believe it.

272
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:43,096
In the final battle.

273
00:20:43,096 --> 00:20:44,576
Nezha gave up the safety package.

274
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,336
North and King are putting on

275
00:20:46,336 --> 00:20:47,376
Meet on on a narrow path

276
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:48,336
To defeat the enemy.

277
00:20:48,336 --> 00:20:50,495
This is unique in the history of crossfire professional league.

278
00:20:50,495 --> 00:20:51,895
Who will use the power of thunder

279
00:20:51,895 --> 00:20:53,495
To destroy the opponent.

280
00:20:53,495 --> 00:20:54,856
It's too suffocating.

281
00:21:10,215 --> 00:21:11,215
I'm not gambling.

282
00:21:12,215 --> 00:21:13,056
I know.

283
00:21:13,376 --> 00:21:14,415
I will definitely win.

284
00:21:16,296 --> 00:21:17,695
The weapon I used was a shovel.

285
00:21:17,856 --> 00:21:19,576
The range of attack is bigger than King's knife.

286
00:21:19,576 --> 00:21:20,655
But the biggest flaw

287
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:21,856
The attack speed is too slow.

288
00:21:22,256 --> 00:21:23,655
He can beat me

289
00:21:23,655 --> 00:21:24,735
To kill me with a knife.

290
00:21:24,895 --> 00:21:25,735
He knows that.

291
00:21:25,735 --> 00:21:26,856
Has been suppressing me.

292
00:21:26,856 --> 00:21:28,175
So that I have no chance to fight back.

293
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:29,415
therefore

294
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:30,536
If you want to win,

295
00:21:30,816 --> 00:21:32,495
There's only one chance.

296
00:21:32,975 --> 00:21:35,056
Now he's full of blood, and I'm full of it.

297
00:21:35,056 --> 00:21:36,895
He will definitely attack from a high point.

298
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,735
Aim for my head and prepare to defeat the enemy.

299
00:21:39,336 --> 00:21:40,655
Within three steps,

300
00:21:40,895 --> 00:21:42,336
The daggers have absolute advantage.

301
00:21:42,616 --> 00:21:44,655
But I'm going to take advantage of his unstable landing.

302
00:21:44,895 --> 00:21:46,256
To his right hand holding the knife.

303
00:21:46,256 --> 00:21:47,415
And lose his balance.

304
00:21:47,695 --> 00:21:49,175
At the same time, I pulled away from him.

305
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:50,655
To get the chance to fight.

306
00:21:50,895 --> 00:21:51,616
to accept

307
00:21:51,616 --> 00:21:53,016
It's my turn to fight back.

308
00:22:19,175 --> 00:22:20,056
to deal the fatal blow

309
00:22:20,296 --> 00:22:22,175
North Blood killed King.

310
00:22:22,495 --> 00:22:24,655
The team has created a miracle.

311
00:22:27,576 --> 00:22:28,935
Xiaobei

312
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,776
The dynasty of gravity is over.

313
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:43,415
This is a new era.

314
00:22:43,415 --> 00:22:46,096
Let's give the honor to the team.

315
00:22:46,096 --> 00:22:48,975
We are the champions.

316
00:22:48,975 --> 00:22:50,776
Congratulations to the team.

317
00:22:50,776 --> 00:22:53,215
We are the champions.

318
00:22:57,816 --> 00:23:07,415
Go on.

319
00:23:17,695 --> 00:23:26,975
Go on.

320
00:23:32,415 --> 00:23:45,415
Go on.

321
00:23:55,695 --> 00:23:56,415
congratulations

322
00:23:58,096 --> 00:23:58,735
Thank you

323
00:23:59,455 --> 00:24:00,695
You played well today.

324
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,895
I really envy you.

325
00:24:05,336 --> 00:24:06,935
There are so many friends who are willing to help you.

326
00:24:14,776 --> 00:24:17,856
Congratulations to the biggest dark horse of the Crossfire Professional League.

327
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:20,935
Continue to win the championship.

328
00:24:23,096 --> 00:24:24,376
This moment has finally come.

329
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,616
Who would have thought

330
00:24:25,816 --> 00:24:28,215
A team that has come up step by step from Hundred Cities.

331
00:24:28,455 --> 00:24:30,495
Finally won the highest honor.

332
00:24:30,895 --> 00:24:32,695
Go on, team, let us believe again.

333
00:24:32,695 --> 00:24:33,776
The power of dreams.

334
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:36,296
This is a memorable day for e-sports people.

335
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:37,856
Go on.

336
00:24:38,455 --> 00:24:39,376
Please win the cup.

337
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,096
We saw the players on the stage

338
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:50,215
Very excited.

339
00:24:50,215 --> 00:24:50,935
I believe

340
00:24:50,935 --> 00:24:53,056
This honor is not only for them,

341
00:24:53,215 --> 00:24:55,135
Also belongs to the players.

342
00:24:55,135 --> 00:24:56,735
Belongs to you.

343
00:25:32,376 --> 00:25:34,096
The champion of this competition.

344
00:25:34,096 --> 00:25:37,576
Will receive a cash reward of 1 million yuan.

345
00:25:37,576 --> 00:25:40,016
Yes, there's also a special award.

346
00:25:40,016 --> 00:25:41,215
King of the Golden Spear.

347
00:25:41,655 --> 00:25:42,816
His bonus is...

348
00:25:42,816 --> 00:25:44,376
200,000 yuan.

349
00:25:44,616 --> 00:25:46,215
Is quite rich.

350
00:25:46,215 --> 00:25:48,215
The King of the Golden Spear

351
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:49,655
Who is it?

352
00:25:49,856 --> 00:25:51,455
I believe you know his name.

353
00:25:51,455 --> 00:25:53,256
Let's call out his name.

354
00:25:53,256 --> 00:25:54,256
He's

355
00:25:54,256 --> 00:25:56,376
Lu Xiao Bei,

356
00:26:07,056 --> 00:26:09,256
Please welcome the representative of SG company.

357
00:26:09,256 --> 00:26:09,895
meanwhile

358
00:26:09,895 --> 00:26:12,256
And one of the designers of crossfire games.

359
00:26:12,256 --> 00:26:13,536
Ms. Chang,

360
00:26:13,856 --> 00:26:15,495
For the winner of the Golden Spear.

361
00:26:15,495 --> 00:26:17,376
Lu Xiao Bei awarded the trophy.

362
00:26:17,975 --> 00:26:19,336
Congratulations to Lu Xiao Bei.

363
00:26:52,056 --> 00:26:52,856
How are you?

364
00:26:55,376 --> 00:26:56,215
Xiao Feng.

365
00:26:57,296 --> 00:26:59,056
I'm also the King of Golden Spear.

366
00:27:04,336 --> 00:27:06,695
Xiao Bei, I'm your super fan.

367
00:27:10,975 --> 00:27:12,735
Congratulations, King of Golden Spear.

368
00:28:25,096 --> 00:28:27,096
I thought I'd never see you again.

369
00:28:35,895 --> 00:28:36,616
Thank you.

370
00:28:40,816 --> 00:28:42,096
You didn't give up on me.

371
00:28:43,856 --> 00:28:45,376
How could I give up on you?

372
00:28:59,856 --> 00:29:00,415
That's it.

373
00:29:01,735 --> 00:29:02,776
Is the champion.

374
00:29:04,616 --> 00:29:05,336
Be happy.

375
00:29:10,695 --> 00:29:11,576
The champion took it.

376
00:29:14,576 --> 00:29:15,895
But it's not over yet.

377
00:29:19,296 --> 00:29:20,495
Make way.

378
00:29:21,336 --> 00:29:21,895
Almost there.

379
00:29:21,895 --> 00:29:22,975
Make way.

380
00:29:22,975 --> 00:29:23,576
Make way.

381
00:29:23,576 --> 00:29:24,576
Don't shoot the front.

382
00:29:24,576 --> 00:29:25,655
Stop shooting.

383
00:30:21,135 --> 00:30:22,655
I came here to look for you.

384
00:30:23,296 --> 00:30:24,975
But you weren't there that time.

385
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:32,616
When I woke up,

386
00:30:34,895 --> 00:30:35,776
I didn't believe it.

387
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,735
I've been in a coma for 11 years.

388
00:30:40,096 --> 00:30:41,215
Standing here now,

389
00:30:41,895 --> 00:30:42,695
I understand.

390
00:30:44,455 --> 00:30:45,536
The house has been torn down.

391
00:30:47,175 --> 00:30:48,296
And moved away.

392
00:30:48,816 --> 00:30:51,096
Time has really changed a lot of things.

393
00:30:51,536 --> 00:30:52,536
time

394
00:30:55,816 --> 00:30:57,455
Really changed a lot of things.

395
00:30:59,735 --> 00:31:00,895
Do you still remember

396
00:31:01,056 --> 00:31:02,776
You told me you were from 2008.

397
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,056
I really thought you were a liar.

398
00:31:05,056 --> 00:31:06,056
At that time,

399
00:31:08,135 --> 00:31:09,816
You told me you're from 2019.

400
00:31:09,816 --> 00:31:11,096
I thought you were crazy.

401
00:31:11,895 --> 00:31:13,256
When we talked,

402
00:31:16,655 --> 00:31:17,735
In that room.

403
00:31:18,935 --> 00:31:20,536
Until I saw Liu Xiang withdraw.

404
00:31:22,296 --> 00:31:23,215
So I believe it.

405
00:31:23,495 --> 00:31:24,296
at that time

406
00:31:24,695 --> 00:31:26,376
I received the postcard you sent me.

407
00:31:27,215 --> 00:31:28,695
I was so scared.

408
00:31:28,975 --> 00:31:30,336
Think about it now.

409
00:31:33,135 --> 00:31:34,336
It's really like a dream.

410
00:31:35,895 --> 00:31:38,016
This dream has brought us too much.

411
00:31:38,536 --> 00:31:40,256
But we paid the price.

412
00:32:04,655 --> 00:32:05,776
On my way here,

413
00:32:06,096 --> 00:32:07,336
My dad called me.

414
00:32:08,616 --> 00:32:09,415
police

415
00:32:10,256 --> 00:32:12,495
An arrest warrant has been issued for Xu Wei.

416
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:13,975
When Xu Wei saw me today,

417
00:32:15,256 --> 00:32:16,735
I will definitely leave early.

418
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:17,935
He committed a felony.

419
00:32:20,215 --> 00:32:21,455
The police won't let him off.

420
00:32:22,135 --> 00:32:24,096
Xu Wei used to be my best friend.

421
00:32:27,135 --> 00:32:28,056
We used to

422
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,256
And suffered a lot.

423
00:32:32,336 --> 00:32:34,296
I treated him like a real brother.

424
00:32:37,735 --> 00:32:39,175
I didn't expect him to change.

425
00:32:40,215 --> 00:32:41,776
Not only harmed you and your brother,

426
00:32:42,536 --> 00:32:43,975
You want to kill me too?

427
00:32:48,536 --> 00:32:49,776
I often advised him

428
00:32:51,695 --> 00:32:52,895
Be the first.

429
00:32:53,816 --> 00:32:54,735
And then do something.

430
00:32:57,336 --> 00:32:58,376
He wouldn't listen.

431
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:04,856
You must be hungry.

432
00:33:04,856 --> 00:33:05,616
What do you want?

433
00:33:06,296 --> 00:33:07,096
Please.

434
00:33:09,975 --> 00:33:10,935
Instant noodles.

435
00:33:10,935 --> 00:33:12,376
I haven't eaten this for 11 years.

436
00:33:12,856 --> 00:33:13,655
I really want to.

437
00:33:33,616 --> 00:33:34,776
The chef hasn't closed down yet.

438
00:33:34,776 --> 00:33:35,536
That's right.

439
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:37,215
Spicy and delicious.

440
00:33:40,735 --> 00:33:41,376
Yes

441
00:33:50,135 --> 00:33:51,135
Do you have ham sausage?

442
00:33:58,056 --> 00:33:58,695
You know what?

443
00:33:59,336 --> 00:34:00,336
Back then,

444
00:34:01,616 --> 00:34:03,296
You're eating the chef's instant noodles.

445
00:34:04,215 --> 00:34:05,016
To sponsor us.

446
00:34:05,016 --> 00:34:07,016
I know you told me

447
00:34:07,096 --> 00:34:08,655
We'll take the chef

448
00:34:08,655 --> 00:34:09,336
And this bowl of noodles.

449
00:34:09,336 --> 00:34:11,175
On the uniforms of our team.

450
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:12,175
You said that.

451
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:12,856
It's also said that

452
00:34:13,576 --> 00:34:15,816
I've been lying for 11 years. I have a problem.

453
00:34:16,016 --> 00:34:17,616
Don't talk about what happened eleven years ago.

454
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:19,175
Let me help you with your lessons.

455
00:34:19,175 --> 00:34:20,256
Do you know what the world

456
00:34:20,576 --> 00:34:21,616
How fast it developed?

457
00:34:21,816 --> 00:34:22,415
Now?

458
00:34:23,576 --> 00:34:24,336
When you go out,

459
00:34:24,935 --> 00:34:25,895
Without a wallet.

460
00:34:25,895 --> 00:34:26,495
No card.

461
00:34:27,096 --> 00:34:27,895
Only mobile phone.

462
00:34:27,895 --> 00:34:28,616
Take your phone with you.

463
00:34:28,856 --> 00:34:29,296
Yes

464
00:34:29,616 --> 00:34:30,415
Now crossing the fire line,

465
00:34:30,415 --> 00:34:31,536
You can play on your phone.

466
00:34:31,776 --> 00:34:32,455
And recently,

467
00:34:32,455 --> 00:34:33,415
Crossing the High Definition Arena

468
00:34:33,576 --> 00:34:34,695
The two endorsers are so handsome.

469
00:34:34,695 --> 00:34:36,455
Crossing the fire line and playing on the phone.

470
00:34:54,776 --> 00:34:56,215
You're back.

471
00:34:57,655 --> 00:34:58,455
What happened

472
00:34:58,616 --> 00:35:01,175
I'm too tired to go upstairs.

473
00:35:01,296 --> 00:35:03,495
Are you going to the celebration tonight?

474
00:35:03,495 --> 00:35:05,376
I've booked the hotel and the singing room.

475
00:35:05,816 --> 00:35:06,616
I'm not going.

476
00:35:08,376 --> 00:35:09,336
Too sleepy.

477
00:35:10,215 --> 00:35:11,175
I want to sleep.

478
00:35:11,536 --> 00:35:12,455
I'm sleepy.

479
00:35:12,455 --> 00:35:13,856
Aren't you hungry?

480
00:35:13,856 --> 00:35:14,735
I'm hungry.

481
00:35:14,735 --> 00:35:16,376
Do you want to order takeout?

482
00:35:17,256 --> 00:35:17,895
Tour leader

483
00:35:18,455 --> 00:35:20,256
We just won so many bonuses.

484
00:35:20,256 --> 00:35:22,816
Let's have a good meal tonight.

485
00:35:24,175 --> 00:35:24,735
That's right.

486
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,655
One million yuan.

487
00:35:27,816 --> 00:35:28,495
captain

488
00:35:28,816 --> 00:35:30,695
And your King of Golden Spear, 200,000 yuan.

489
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:32,616
The bonus is a lot.

490
00:35:32,816 --> 00:35:34,016
To our hands.

491
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,175
Is less than 1 million.

492
00:35:35,576 --> 00:35:37,016
After ten working days.

493
00:35:37,336 --> 00:35:38,816
With the previous operating costs,

494
00:35:39,336 --> 00:35:41,935
And deduct 20% from the budget.

495
00:35:41,935 --> 00:35:42,695
to accept

496
00:35:42,695 --> 00:35:43,935
We still need to hire people.

497
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:47,816
Promotion of business technology support

498
00:36:31,376 --> 00:36:32,135
Isn't it the first time

499
00:36:32,135 --> 00:36:33,735
The clothing store over there?

500
00:36:33,735 --> 00:36:34,215
Yes

501
00:36:37,935 --> 00:36:39,495
I wanted to buy a black jacket.

502
00:36:39,895 --> 00:36:41,975
I haven't saved enough for a long time.

503
00:36:42,415 --> 00:36:44,656
No one goes to the clothing store to buy clothes now.

504
00:36:45,015 --> 00:36:46,136
Are bought online.

505
00:36:46,136 --> 00:36:47,256
There are many kinds and they are cheap.

506
00:36:47,696 --> 00:36:48,615
If you're not satisfied,

507
00:36:48,615 --> 00:36:50,256
You can change at any time.

508
00:36:52,136 --> 00:36:52,776
It's so convenient.

509
00:36:52,776 --> 00:36:53,296
Yes

510
00:36:58,575 --> 00:37:00,015
Xiao Bei came to see me yesterday.

511
00:37:00,216 --> 00:37:00,776
What's up

512
00:37:02,615 --> 00:37:03,816
Bought me a box of instant noodles.

513
00:37:06,656 --> 00:37:07,736
You want instant noodles?

514
00:37:08,776 --> 00:37:09,336
That's right.

515
00:37:09,615 --> 00:37:10,535
Eleven years ago.

516
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,336
It's still good.

517
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:13,415
yes

518
00:37:14,015 --> 00:37:15,216
After eating instant noodles,

519
00:37:15,856 --> 00:37:17,095
When I smelled it,

520
00:37:17,656 --> 00:37:18,816
I thought of the team.

521
00:37:19,336 --> 00:37:20,535
Thinking of this street,

522
00:37:21,015 --> 00:37:22,095
I don't think so.

523
00:37:26,256 --> 00:37:26,935
Isn't it the first time

524
00:37:26,935 --> 00:37:28,816
Do we often train that internet café?

525
00:37:28,816 --> 00:37:30,055
Yes, the hairdresser's cafe.

526
00:37:30,736 --> 00:37:32,095
Has become a delivery company.

527
00:37:32,095 --> 00:37:33,615
The network is getting more and more developed.

528
00:37:33,615 --> 00:37:34,656
There are fewer internet cafes.

529
00:37:34,656 --> 00:37:35,615
Is getting better and better.

530
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:37,495
Yes

531
00:37:37,495 --> 00:37:38,856
It's not called an internet cafe.

532
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,095
Has been changed to an internet cafe.

533
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,816
Isn't this Lao Li's barbecue?

534
00:37:47,816 --> 00:37:48,296
Yes

535
00:37:49,415 --> 00:37:50,415
The door has changed.

536
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:52,736
The times are progressing.

537
00:37:52,736 --> 00:37:54,336
Business is getting better and better.

538
00:37:54,615 --> 00:37:56,895
Many young people drive tens of kilometers.

539
00:37:57,535 --> 00:37:58,336
Waiting for two hours.

540
00:37:58,336 --> 00:38:00,015
So I could come here to play.

541
00:38:00,015 --> 00:38:01,015
Has become an internet celebrity store.

542
00:38:04,975 --> 00:38:05,575
what?

543
00:38:06,415 --> 00:38:08,656
Go inside and taste it. The taste hasn't changed.

544
00:38:09,776 --> 00:38:10,935
Isn't it written?

545
00:38:11,216 --> 00:38:12,055
Closed

546
00:38:14,495 --> 00:38:15,935
Do you know why you are off today?

547
00:38:16,136 --> 00:38:16,776
why

548
00:38:17,015 --> 00:38:18,656
Because this shop is mine now.

549
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:22,376
Go inside and have a taste.

550
00:38:26,415 --> 00:38:27,575
And air conditioning.

551
00:38:34,216 --> 00:38:34,696
sit

552
00:38:39,935 --> 00:38:41,216
The doctor won't let me drink.

553
00:38:41,415 --> 00:38:42,095
What's wrong?

554
00:38:43,055 --> 00:38:43,895
You don't want to drink it?

555
00:38:44,095 --> 00:38:45,216
And won't let us drink it.

556
00:38:45,376 --> 00:38:46,136
we

557
00:38:46,535 --> 00:38:48,535
It's time to reunite.

558
00:39:17,935 --> 00:39:19,176
Come and drink.

559
00:39:21,895 --> 00:39:22,615
We

560
00:39:23,216 --> 00:39:25,216
Report to the captain.

561
00:39:25,216 --> 00:39:28,615
The situation we have been in these years,

562
00:39:29,856 --> 00:39:30,656
Monkey, you go first.

563
00:39:30,656 --> 00:39:31,856
I can't.

564
00:39:32,696 --> 00:39:33,176
he

565
00:39:33,615 --> 00:39:34,336
he

566
00:39:34,696 --> 00:39:36,975
He's the best here.

567
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,656
You need to make a sample.

568
00:39:38,656 --> 00:39:39,816
You go first.

569
00:39:40,256 --> 00:39:40,895
Yes

570
00:39:40,895 --> 00:39:42,816
You should be the first one.

571
00:39:42,816 --> 00:39:44,455
This barbecue restaurant is all yours.

572
00:39:44,455 --> 00:39:46,055
OK

573
00:39:47,055 --> 00:39:47,776
Look.

574
00:39:48,415 --> 00:39:49,455
What should I say?

575
00:39:49,455 --> 00:39:50,455
Two words.

576
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,015
I'm rich.

577
00:39:52,895 --> 00:39:53,535
Alright.

578
00:39:53,535 --> 00:39:55,816
Anyway, no outsiders say that.

579
00:39:57,095 --> 00:39:57,696
Yes

580
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,376
Here you are. The samples are ready.

581
00:40:00,895 --> 00:40:01,895
Ming, come on.

582
00:40:01,895 --> 00:40:02,736
good

583
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:03,455
I'll do it.

584
00:40:03,455 --> 00:40:04,296
What about me?

585
00:40:04,296 --> 00:40:06,055
Now I'm running a logistics company.

586
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:08,415
There's a small fleet at the port.

587
00:40:08,415 --> 00:40:09,376
Business is good.

588
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:10,376
Acceptable

589
00:40:10,376 --> 00:40:11,216
modest

590
00:40:11,935 --> 00:40:13,376
I got married in 15.

591
00:40:13,615 --> 00:40:14,736
There are no children now.

592
00:40:17,776 --> 00:40:18,336
Al-Amin

593
00:40:18,336 --> 00:40:19,296
Can you say that?

594
00:40:19,296 --> 00:40:20,176
You can't do that.

595
00:40:21,256 --> 00:40:22,776
You need help. Say something.

596
00:40:25,095 --> 00:40:26,656
I'm good at that.

597
00:40:26,656 --> 00:40:27,296
I mean,

598
00:40:27,296 --> 00:40:28,656
I can give him acupuncture.

599
00:40:29,376 --> 00:40:30,015
Yes

600
00:40:30,415 --> 00:40:31,055
Old sand.

601
00:40:31,656 --> 00:40:32,216
Come on.

602
00:40:32,495 --> 00:40:33,336
I want you.

603
00:40:33,856 --> 00:40:34,535
I've ordered you.

604
00:40:36,136 --> 00:40:39,696
I have opened a medical clinic in Ningjiang.

605
00:40:39,975 --> 00:40:42,535
I inherited our family business.

606
00:40:43,296 --> 00:40:45,095
But I'm doing better than my dad.

607
00:40:45,095 --> 00:40:46,696
I opened six branches.

608
00:40:46,696 --> 00:40:47,736
I also have money.

609
00:40:48,575 --> 00:40:49,575
Then,

610
00:40:49,575 --> 00:40:50,935
I got married in 2012.

611
00:40:51,216 --> 00:40:52,615
Then my child was six years old.

612
00:40:52,816 --> 00:40:54,376
You're in kindergarten now.

613
00:40:55,015 --> 00:40:55,455
can

614
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:57,176
Old Sha is still capable.

615
00:40:57,176 --> 00:40:58,256
I'll have one.

616
00:40:58,495 --> 00:40:59,455
Ming, learn from me.

617
00:41:02,176 --> 00:41:05,015
The last one, the last person.

618
00:41:05,015 --> 00:41:05,935
I think so.

619
00:41:05,935 --> 00:41:07,015
There's nothing wrong with it.

620
00:41:08,856 --> 00:41:09,856
Come on, monkey.

621
00:41:10,415 --> 00:41:11,336
He can't avoid it.

622
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:12,055
I

623
00:41:13,856 --> 00:41:14,575
Not worth mentioning

624
00:41:14,575 --> 00:41:17,336
To be a director of the Nanshan District Office.

625
00:41:18,495 --> 00:41:19,856
Get married this year.

626
00:41:21,535 --> 00:41:23,015
Why are you bringing this up?

627
00:41:23,015 --> 00:41:25,055
Didn't you just get married?

628
00:41:25,055 --> 00:41:27,216
We went to a wedding before.

629
00:41:27,216 --> 00:41:29,015
If you wake up a month earlier,

630
00:41:29,256 --> 00:41:31,176
You can make it to his third wedding party.

631
00:41:32,095 --> 00:41:32,776
hate

632
00:41:33,095 --> 00:41:34,015
Over the years,

633
00:41:35,376 --> 00:41:38,095
Married three times and separated three times.

634
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:38,856
but

635
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:40,176
She hasn't changed.

636
00:41:40,736 --> 00:41:41,615
Or is it

637
00:41:44,136 --> 00:41:45,055
I see.

638
00:41:45,895 --> 00:41:47,055
You don't like to be fat.

639
00:41:47,656 --> 00:41:48,656
We haven't cleared the customs yet.

640
00:41:50,176 --> 00:41:51,256
I didn't pass the test.

641
00:41:51,615 --> 00:41:52,856
How dare you say that?

642
00:41:53,176 --> 00:41:54,095
You know what, Captain?

643
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,656
He's remarried, but he still has a wedding.

644
00:41:55,935 --> 00:41:57,776
I've been with them three times.

645
00:41:57,776 --> 00:41:59,055
So are we.

646
00:41:59,055 --> 00:42:01,376
Monkey, it's called the way a gentleman loves money.

647
00:42:01,615 --> 00:42:03,615
It's up to you.

648
00:42:03,615 --> 00:42:04,256
such

649
00:42:04,256 --> 00:42:07,535
Hold on, I'll drink three bottles.

650
00:42:07,535 --> 00:42:08,656
Can I make amends?

651
00:42:08,656 --> 00:42:09,975
Don't say it's useless.

652
00:42:10,136 --> 00:42:11,136
Dry this bottle first.

653
00:42:11,136 --> 00:42:12,455
Yeah, you drink this first.

654
00:42:12,575 --> 00:42:14,495
Don't drink it now.

655
00:42:14,495 --> 00:42:15,736
Drink this now.

656
00:42:15,975 --> 00:42:17,535
Captain, don't you stop me?

657
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,176
There's nothing wrong with it.

658
00:42:21,015 --> 00:42:22,495
good

659
00:42:22,495 --> 00:42:23,736
Make fun of

660
00:42:23,736 --> 00:42:24,376
Captain has spoken.

661
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:25,176
He has the capacity.

662
00:42:26,216 --> 00:42:26,895
Is there any more wine?

663
00:42:27,535 --> 00:42:28,495
Yes, there is.

664
00:42:29,176 --> 00:42:29,935
A little something.

665
00:42:37,816 --> 00:42:39,296
Seeing how happy you are,

666
00:42:40,575 --> 00:42:41,415
You live so well.

667
00:42:43,816 --> 00:42:44,656
Let's have a toast.

668
00:42:47,535 --> 00:42:48,095
come

669
00:42:52,575 --> 00:42:53,176
captain

670
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,495
The Coin Team.

671
00:42:57,256 --> 00:42:59,736
The breakthrough, Kirin.

672
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:01,615
Please come back.

673
00:43:10,415 --> 00:43:11,015
captain

674
00:43:12,055 --> 00:43:12,696
The Coin Team.

675
00:43:13,455 --> 00:43:15,615
Breakout player, Ah Ming, please come back.

676
00:43:19,856 --> 00:43:20,656
captain

677
00:43:23,216 --> 00:43:24,055
After break

678
00:43:26,095 --> 00:43:27,455
The Steel Coin Battle Team is often shaded.

679
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:30,696
Please come back.

680
00:43:30,696 --> 00:43:31,575
captain

681
00:43:32,816 --> 00:43:33,615
The Coin Team.

682
00:43:35,015 --> 00:43:36,216
Super backup.

683
00:43:38,495 --> 00:43:39,535
Please come back.

684
00:43:50,975 --> 00:43:52,256
Xiao Feng, captain of the Steel Coin Team,

685
00:43:57,736 --> 00:43:58,816
To return to the team.

686
00:44:00,136 --> 00:44:04,575
Cheers.

687
00:45:06,615 --> 00:45:07,216
Police officer.

688
00:45:07,216 --> 00:45:08,136
Mr. Xu is not here.

689
00:45:08,615 --> 00:45:09,856
You can't look around.

690
00:45:09,856 --> 00:45:11,216
A lot of information here is confidential.

691
00:45:11,935 --> 00:45:14,455
I'm a police officer from Nanshan Police Station of Ningjiang City.

692
00:45:15,015 --> 00:45:15,816
This is an arrest warrant.

693
00:45:16,095 --> 00:45:18,216
Xu Wei is suspected of hit-and-run.

694
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:19,015
And intentional homicide.

695
00:45:19,256 --> 00:45:21,055
I hope you can cooperate with us.

696
00:45:22,176 --> 00:45:23,376
Take the computer back.

697
00:45:24,535 --> 00:45:26,615
Take all the information back.

698
00:45:26,895 --> 00:45:28,776
Did Xu Wei contact the company today?

699
00:45:31,015 --> 00:45:32,455
We should hold a regular meeting today.

700
00:45:33,176 --> 00:45:34,376
Mr. Xu hasn't come yet.

701
00:45:34,975 --> 00:45:36,176
My phone is off.

702
00:45:42,256 --> 00:45:43,015
meow

703
00:45:48,015 --> 00:45:48,856
meow

704
00:46:04,856 --> 00:46:06,136
Back in the day,

705
00:46:06,136 --> 00:46:07,535
I've seen these cats.

706
00:46:07,975 --> 00:46:10,095
They're cuter than the photos.

707
00:46:11,495 --> 00:46:12,615
I didn't recognize him.

708
00:46:13,736 --> 00:46:15,656
I'm the one

709
00:46:15,656 --> 00:46:17,336
Is the difference that big?

710
00:46:26,376 --> 00:46:28,296
I've summoned the courage to meet you.

711
00:46:28,575 --> 00:46:31,856
Aren't you going to say hello to me?

712
00:46:35,415 --> 00:46:36,256
Hello

713
00:46:38,336 --> 00:46:39,095
Hello

714
00:46:44,495 --> 00:46:46,455
This is the official invitation.

715
00:46:46,455 --> 00:46:47,736
The team will represent China.

716
00:46:47,736 --> 00:46:50,095
To participate in the Crossfire World Finals.

717
00:46:50,095 --> 00:46:51,455
The location is in Singapore.

718
00:46:51,455 --> 00:46:53,176
We still have one and a half months to prepare.

719
00:46:58,216 --> 00:46:59,256
Nezha, protection deity

720
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,336
Where's your hair?

721
00:47:01,615 --> 00:47:02,136
Cut it off.

722
00:47:02,136 --> 00:47:03,696
People all over the world cut their hair.

723
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:05,376
I believe you cut your hair.

724
00:47:05,376 --> 00:47:06,975
What's wrong with you?

725
00:47:06,975 --> 00:47:08,015
When I was walking on the street,

726
00:47:08,015 --> 00:47:09,136
I'm afraid that others can't see me.

727
00:47:09,136 --> 00:47:09,696
Not anymore.

728
00:47:09,696 --> 00:47:11,136
I think it's much more handsome than before.

729
00:47:11,136 --> 00:47:12,296
You are so manly.

730
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,296
This is it.

731
00:47:18,136 --> 00:47:20,176
The hottest internet celebrity noodle shop in this area

732
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,615
Eleven years ago.

733
00:47:22,575 --> 00:47:23,935
I used to eat here.

734
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:25,696
It's almost time for lunch.

735
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:27,296
Buy me a meal.

736
00:47:29,575 --> 00:47:30,895
I can afford it.

737
00:47:31,495 --> 00:47:32,055
go

738
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:34,455
Boss

739
00:47:34,455 --> 00:47:35,176
You're here.

740
00:47:35,336 --> 00:47:36,336
Long time no see

741
00:47:36,656 --> 00:47:38,376
What noodles are the best?

742
00:47:39,376 --> 00:47:40,176
Sign noodles.

743
00:47:41,256 --> 00:47:42,415
The entrance enchantment.

744
00:47:43,776 --> 00:47:45,776
Okay, two bowls of signature noodles.

745
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:48,336
There are two empty seats over there.

746
00:47:48,336 --> 00:47:49,136
Why don't you go and sit down?

747
00:47:49,136 --> 00:47:49,696
I'll have some.

748
00:47:50,176 --> 00:47:50,535
a row

749
00:47:51,575 --> 00:47:52,656
Two bowls of signature noodles.

750
00:47:52,656 --> 00:47:53,495
Meat and vegetables.

751
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:53,975
good

752
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:55,415
Forty yuan.

753
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:21,455
Hello, Lu Xiabei.

754
00:48:21,455 --> 00:48:22,535
I have arrived

755
00:48:22,736 --> 00:48:23,816
Which table are you at?

756
00:49:36,736 --> 00:49:37,535
I'll take you to a restaurant later.

757
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,656
How about a good noodle restaurant?

758
00:49:42,376 --> 00:49:43,935
I have an oral English class tonight.

759
00:49:45,136 --> 00:49:45,736
another day

760
00:49:46,256 --> 00:49:47,776
It's okay.

761
00:49:48,256 --> 00:49:49,216
I'll take you there another time.

762
00:49:49,776 --> 00:49:51,296
It's delicious. I'm telling you,

763
00:50:15,015 --> 00:50:16,296
You like chillies.

764
00:50:18,856 --> 00:50:20,895
This is the place I promised you.

765
00:50:22,376 --> 00:50:23,176
I want to take you to eat.

766
00:50:23,176 --> 00:50:24,975
My favorite restaurant.

767
00:50:27,615 --> 00:50:28,856
Eleven years late.

768
00:50:32,415 --> 00:50:33,336
sorry

769
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:18,495
Xiao Feng.
