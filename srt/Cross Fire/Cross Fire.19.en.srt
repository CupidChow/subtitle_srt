1
00:03:13,077 --> 00:03:13,798
Stand up and try.

2
00:03:19,717 --> 00:03:20,478
Slow down.

3
00:03:26,717 --> 00:03:27,958
And recovered very well.

4
00:03:28,517 --> 00:03:29,157
bone

5
00:03:29,157 --> 00:03:30,637
Nerves and muscles

6
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:31,877
Are doing well.

7
00:03:32,038 --> 00:03:32,557
Sit down.

8
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:38,078
Of course

9
00:03:38,078 --> 00:03:39,157
At this stage,

10
00:03:39,157 --> 00:03:40,197
Can't be separated from the crutches.

11
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:42,118
To continue the rehabilitation training.

12
00:03:42,637 --> 00:03:43,197
doctor

13
00:03:43,517 --> 00:03:44,237
Thank you so much.

14
00:03:44,237 --> 00:03:44,758
Thank you so much.

15
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:45,277
That's right.

16
00:03:45,277 --> 00:03:45,837
Don't thank me.

17
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:46,998
Thank you.

18
00:03:47,157 --> 00:03:49,237
And thank your son's recovery coach.

19
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:50,718
Judging from his condition,

20
00:03:51,118 --> 00:03:51,718
It must be

21
00:03:52,237 --> 00:03:53,637
Put a lot of energy into it.

22
00:03:54,038 --> 00:03:54,957
Suffered a lot.

23
00:03:55,237 --> 00:03:55,837
Right?

24
00:03:56,398 --> 00:03:57,517
This brat

25
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:58,957
When did the whole recovery coach

26
00:03:58,957 --> 00:03:59,557
I don't know.

27
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:01,957
Now I look at the total scores.

28
00:04:01,957 --> 00:04:02,997
She should be able to come out.

29
00:04:06,917 --> 00:04:07,997
568 points.

30
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:08,837
Alright, brat.

31
00:04:08,837 --> 00:04:10,758
It's 20 points higher than last year.

32
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:11,958
Son, you're amazing.

33
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:12,958
Give me a high five.

34
00:04:15,357 --> 00:04:16,197
Take a good look.

35
00:04:16,797 --> 00:04:17,478
Is this...

36
00:04:18,398 --> 00:04:19,637
Is it too high?

37
00:04:19,997 --> 00:04:20,917
What high?

38
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:22,318
He didn't calculate the uncertainty.

39
00:04:22,318 --> 00:04:23,637
My son is conservative enough.

40
00:04:23,637 --> 00:04:25,318
Think about whether to go to Beijing or Shanghai.

41
00:04:25,678 --> 00:04:26,678
Of course I went to Beijing.

42
00:04:26,678 --> 00:04:29,077
Beijing has the best education resources in the country.

43
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:30,758
No, Beijing is too dry.

44
00:04:30,997 --> 00:04:32,797
I think Shanghai is the best choice.

45
00:04:32,797 --> 00:04:34,158
What Shanghai?

46
00:04:34,158 --> 00:04:36,437
The winter in Shanghai is cold and wet.

47
00:04:36,437 --> 00:04:38,357
It's bad for the child's leg.

48
00:04:38,357 --> 00:04:39,637
Then we will consider Beijing.

49
00:04:40,357 --> 00:04:41,518
Let me remind you.

50
00:04:41,997 --> 00:04:43,717
It's important to choose a university.

51
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:45,197
But the most important thing is

52
00:04:45,437 --> 00:04:46,398
It's my major.

53
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:47,318
That's right.

54
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:48,398
son

55
00:04:48,678 --> 00:04:49,837
Why are you out?

56
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:51,158
Xiaobei

57
00:04:51,678 --> 00:04:52,518
Why are you out?

58
00:04:53,437 --> 00:04:54,797
Tell your parents.

59
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,038
What's your major?

60
00:05:01,398 --> 00:05:02,518
I want to continue to play e-sports.

61
00:05:05,837 --> 00:05:07,278
Didn't you finish it a while ago?

62
00:05:07,957 --> 00:05:09,397
The Hundred Cities Competition is an amateur competition.

63
00:05:10,158 --> 00:05:11,237
I want to play Tencent e-sports games.

64
00:05:11,517 --> 00:05:12,117
If you can get it,

65
00:05:12,117 --> 00:05:13,077
The top two of Tencent Esports Games.

66
00:05:13,677 --> 00:05:14,158
There's a chance.

67
00:05:14,158 --> 00:05:15,038
Can enter the Crossfire Professional League.

68
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:15,797
In the professional league.

69
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:19,517
Your team hasn't won a hundred cities.

70
00:05:19,517 --> 00:05:20,878
How to play Tencent e-sports games?

71
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:23,797
I'll think of a way.

72
00:05:23,797 --> 00:05:25,038
And contact the team of Tencent Esports Games.

73
00:05:26,318 --> 00:05:27,038
Stop, stop.

74
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:29,038
Let's not talk about you.

75
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:30,278
Even if you have a spectrum,

76
00:05:30,278 --> 00:05:32,197
We can't stay in a good university.

77
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:33,237
Go play games.

78
00:05:33,797 --> 00:05:35,598
Aren't you wasting your youth?

79
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:37,838
I can go to college later.

80
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,598
But it's really only a year or two.

81
00:05:39,998 --> 00:05:40,998
I have the ability.

82
00:05:41,598 --> 00:05:42,878
I just need a chance.

83
00:05:43,357 --> 00:05:43,917
Believe me.

84
00:05:43,917 --> 00:05:45,237
I will definitely be professional.

85
00:05:46,677 --> 00:05:47,117
son

86
00:05:47,438 --> 00:05:48,957
It's hard to be a professional.

87
00:05:49,077 --> 00:05:50,038
You must think it through.

88
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:50,677
No, no.

89
00:05:51,758 --> 00:05:52,278
Xiaobei

90
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:55,357
I used to do everything for you.

91
00:05:55,998 --> 00:05:57,077
I've never made things difficult for you.

92
00:05:57,517 --> 00:05:58,517
But not this time.

93
00:05:58,677 --> 00:06:00,637
It concerns your future and destiny.

94
00:06:00,637 --> 00:06:02,718
You can't let your temper take over.

95
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:03,878
Don't worry.

96
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,237
Since the child said so,

97
00:06:05,237 --> 00:06:06,077
He must have his own idea.

98
00:06:06,077 --> 00:06:06,517
Shut up!

99
00:06:07,237 --> 00:06:08,237
There's no discussion.

100
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:18,917
Hello

101
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:19,677
This is our captain.

102
00:06:19,677 --> 00:06:20,598
The five-game suspension is full.

103
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:21,517
Are you ready to play?

104
00:06:21,517 --> 00:06:22,558
Show me your ID.

105
00:06:29,318 --> 00:06:29,797
Sign here.

106
00:06:36,158 --> 00:06:36,797
come

107
00:06:37,677 --> 00:06:38,598
This is the first time

108
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:39,197
The tactics are unchanged.

109
00:06:39,197 --> 00:06:40,197
Hold your position.

110
00:06:40,197 --> 00:06:40,838
Come on.

111
00:06:40,838 --> 00:06:41,718
Come on

112
00:06:41,718 --> 00:06:42,558
One, two, three.

113
00:06:42,838 --> 00:06:43,517
Come on

114
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:44,917
Let's go.

115
00:07:04,278 --> 00:07:04,998
Middle road

116
00:07:04,998 --> 00:07:05,677
There's another one.

117
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:05,998
I found it.

118
00:07:05,998 --> 00:07:06,318
I found the bag.

119
00:07:06,318 --> 00:07:06,838
Xiao Feng, cover it.

120
00:07:15,557 --> 00:07:16,237
Cheat

121
00:07:16,237 --> 00:07:17,237
A cheater.

122
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:18,478
Open the auxiliary external hanger.

123
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:19,677
How dare you?

124
00:07:19,677 --> 00:07:20,437
Scum

125
00:07:20,437 --> 00:07:21,478
You have to admit your mistakes.

126
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:22,278
Have you thought about the consequences?

127
00:07:22,278 --> 00:07:24,158
Are we still hanging out at Zero Cafe?

128
00:07:24,158 --> 00:07:25,117
Get out of Ning River.

129
00:07:25,117 --> 00:07:26,357
It's all my fault.

130
00:07:26,357 --> 00:07:27,158
Get out of Ning River.

131
00:07:27,158 --> 00:07:28,437
Our team doesn't deserve to win the championship.

132
00:07:29,278 --> 00:07:29,638
Get out of Ning River.

133
00:07:29,638 --> 00:07:31,398
You should be a man first.

134
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:33,877
Find yourself.

135
00:07:33,877 --> 00:07:34,877
What you really need?

136
00:07:34,877 --> 00:07:36,997
If you want to win, you don't care about the right and wrong.

137
00:07:36,997 --> 00:07:37,877
You can't afford to lose.

138
00:07:37,877 --> 00:07:39,437
I don't want to start all over again.

139
00:07:40,117 --> 00:07:41,638
If you don't do your best,

140
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:43,598
Then you're wasting your time.

141
00:07:59,877 --> 00:08:00,917
Lieutenant

142
00:08:11,237 --> 00:08:12,518
You won.

143
00:08:13,437 --> 00:08:13,877
You won.

144
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:14,877
You won.

145
00:08:18,757 --> 00:08:19,078
Low-key

146
00:08:19,518 --> 00:08:20,237
Low-key

147
00:08:20,437 --> 00:08:21,518
Don't hit him.

148
00:08:21,518 --> 00:08:22,718
Forget what I told you?

149
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,357
Hello, we're the Coin Team.

150
00:08:27,357 --> 00:08:28,237
To change.

151
00:08:28,437 --> 00:08:29,117
You can choose.

152
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:29,838
Come and find me.

153
00:08:30,198 --> 00:08:31,237
We can choose by ourselves.

154
00:08:31,237 --> 00:08:31,917
Okay, thank you.

155
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:32,237
come

156
00:08:33,317 --> 00:08:34,797
These are all international brands.

157
00:08:35,877 --> 00:08:36,677
This brand

158
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,437
It matches my temperament.

159
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:39,357
AnLuan

160
00:08:39,357 --> 00:08:39,757
Look at you.

161
00:08:39,757 --> 00:08:40,518
This suits you well.

162
00:08:40,518 --> 00:08:41,958
You've never seen the world before.

163
00:08:42,518 --> 00:08:43,797
It sounds like you've worn it.

164
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:44,638
How about this?

165
00:08:44,638 --> 00:08:44,877
this

166
00:08:45,117 --> 00:08:46,958
These three bars are adidas.

167
00:08:48,158 --> 00:08:49,437
Look carefully.

168
00:08:49,598 --> 00:08:51,237
You're a diaosi.

169
00:08:52,437 --> 00:08:53,357
Adi Diaos.

170
00:08:54,437 --> 00:08:55,278
Adidas?

171
00:08:55,598 --> 00:08:56,398
Look at this.

172
00:08:56,398 --> 00:08:57,718
This color suits you.

173
00:08:57,718 --> 00:08:58,917
This yellow is also suitable for you.

174
00:08:58,917 --> 00:08:59,797
It's too dirty.

175
00:08:59,797 --> 00:09:00,757
It's khaki.

176
00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:01,718
Only you can handle it.

177
00:09:02,117 --> 00:09:02,757
Alright

178
00:09:02,757 --> 00:09:03,198
Hold on, I...

179
00:09:03,198 --> 00:09:03,478
Let's go.

180
00:09:03,478 --> 00:09:03,917
Get changed. Let's go.

181
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:06,877
This is cool.

182
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:07,917
You're more green.

183
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:08,198
Really

184
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:08,718
can

185
00:09:08,718 --> 00:09:09,237
And my

186
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:11,718
You're here too.

187
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:14,997
go

188
00:09:21,757 --> 00:09:22,237
feed

189
00:09:22,718 --> 00:09:23,158
hello

190
00:09:23,357 --> 00:09:23,797
Boss, hello.

191
00:09:24,278 --> 00:09:25,638
We are the team.

192
00:09:25,877 --> 00:09:26,117
Yes

193
00:09:26,117 --> 00:09:27,278
The one we took before

194
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:29,038
The third place of Ningjiang Division Hundred Cities League.

195
00:09:29,038 --> 00:09:30,598
It's okay. We don't mind.

196
00:09:30,598 --> 00:09:32,198
Our team is the most cost-effective.

197
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:33,237
And it's cheap.

198
00:09:33,237 --> 00:09:34,797
Serve you wholeheartedly.

199
00:09:34,797 --> 00:09:35,078
all right?

200
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:35,317
Hello

201
00:09:35,317 --> 00:09:35,838
I'm here.

202
00:09:35,838 --> 00:09:36,398
Ask someone else.

203
00:09:36,398 --> 00:09:36,757
I know.

204
00:09:36,757 --> 00:09:37,278
Dude, don't worry.

205
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:38,437
This is TT Games.

206
00:09:38,437 --> 00:09:39,718
If you have a seat,

207
00:09:39,718 --> 00:09:40,357
Contact us anytime.

208
00:09:40,357 --> 00:09:40,718
Let's talk about it.

209
00:09:40,718 --> 00:09:41,237
Think about it.

210
00:09:41,237 --> 00:09:41,877
For the time being.

211
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:45,078
There's no room left.

212
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:45,478
That

213
00:09:45,478 --> 00:09:46,158
Wait a second.

214
00:09:46,158 --> 00:09:47,078
We have a good price.

215
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:47,917
Just let us go.

216
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:48,598
Hello, let's have a try.

217
00:09:48,877 --> 00:09:50,757
I'm Lu Xiaobei, the captain of the Continuing Team.

218
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:51,317
Sorry to bother you.

219
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:53,038
It's okay.

220
00:09:53,557 --> 00:09:55,158
We are willing to try as long as there is an opportunity.

221
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:56,357
The conditions can be said slowly.

222
00:09:56,478 --> 00:09:57,357
It's five people.

223
00:09:57,557 --> 00:09:58,677
good

224
00:09:58,677 --> 00:09:59,917
Xiao Bei, forget it.

225
00:10:01,158 --> 00:10:01,958
Right now?

226
00:10:02,917 --> 00:10:03,838
There's no problem.

227
00:10:03,838 --> 00:10:04,478
Yes, right away.

228
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:06,638
Southern monster

229
00:10:06,638 --> 00:10:07,638
To interview us on video.

230
00:10:07,877 --> 00:10:08,557
Really

231
00:10:10,117 --> 00:10:10,718
I called.

232
00:10:10,718 --> 00:10:11,357
good

233
00:10:12,437 --> 00:10:13,237
It's not exciting.

234
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:13,757
calm and collected

235
00:10:14,557 --> 00:10:15,117
You know,

236
00:10:16,718 --> 00:10:17,598
Hello, President Guo.

237
00:10:17,797 --> 00:10:18,958
I'm going to stay on the team.

238
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,557
The captain of the team, Lu Xiaobei.

239
00:10:20,797 --> 00:10:21,398
Hello, President Guo.

240
00:10:21,398 --> 00:10:22,158
I'm Cheng Hao.

241
00:10:22,557 --> 00:10:24,757
I've read your information. It's good.

242
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:26,398
But my team

243
00:10:26,398 --> 00:10:27,278
every kettle has its lid

244
00:10:27,478 --> 00:10:28,598
Has been signed.

245
00:10:29,038 --> 00:10:31,958
I'm looking for some substitutes to be my sparring partners.

246
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,398
Does the substitute have a chance to play?

247
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:36,437
The substitute is mainly to help the main force to adjust tactics.

248
00:10:36,437 --> 00:10:38,038
I can't guarantee to play.

249
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,718
It depends on the situation.

250
00:10:39,838 --> 00:10:40,838
If you want to,

251
00:10:40,838 --> 00:10:41,638
You can have a try.

252
00:10:41,638 --> 00:10:42,278
good

253
00:10:48,598 --> 00:10:49,198
Hello, everyone.

254
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:51,598
Welcome to Jiayi's live studio.

255
00:10:51,598 --> 00:10:53,437
Jiayi will teach you today.

256
00:10:53,437 --> 00:10:56,518
How to get to Point A quickly using A Trail

257
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:10,838
Let's get closer.

258
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:11,877
Otherwise, the video frame

259
00:11:12,158 --> 00:11:12,838
unseen

260
00:11:15,038 --> 00:11:16,917
I'm at my grandma's nursing home.

261
00:11:18,518 --> 00:11:19,518
When you look at it,

262
00:11:19,518 --> 00:11:20,877
You guys have a good life.

263
00:11:21,237 --> 00:11:22,797
Since I can't see you,

264
00:11:22,797 --> 00:11:24,557
My head doesn't ache and my eyes don't bother.

265
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:26,117
Don't mention how happy I was.

266
00:11:26,117 --> 00:11:26,757
Big Sister,

267
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:27,518
This

268
00:11:27,518 --> 00:11:28,757
Is it menopause?

269
00:11:28,757 --> 00:11:29,797
Advance Syndrome.

270
00:11:30,317 --> 00:11:32,357
Cheng Hao, do you want to be beaten?

271
00:11:33,517 --> 00:11:33,877
WangKai

272
00:11:34,637 --> 00:11:35,798
I heard that

273
00:11:35,798 --> 00:11:36,997
And carrying the keyboard and mouse.

274
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:37,958
To find someone else to kick the club.

275
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:38,678
Yes

276
00:11:38,678 --> 00:11:39,838
What else can I do?

277
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:41,357
Teach them how to behave.

278
00:11:41,798 --> 00:11:42,357
Brother Zha.

279
00:11:42,718 --> 00:11:43,438
Nezha, protection deity

280
00:11:43,438 --> 00:11:44,237
Where are you?

281
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:44,877
Come out.

282
00:11:49,157 --> 00:11:49,997
Or hot eyes?

283
00:11:49,997 --> 00:11:51,037
Go back.

284
00:11:51,037 --> 00:11:51,877
That's enough.

285
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:52,598
Get down to business.

286
00:11:53,277 --> 00:11:55,117
There's one now.

287
00:11:55,117 --> 00:11:56,318
It's not an opportunity.

288
00:11:57,277 --> 00:11:58,558
There's a team in Tencent Esports Games.

289
00:11:58,877 --> 00:12:00,277
To sign a team as a substitute.

290
00:12:00,798 --> 00:12:01,678
The location is in Shenzhen.

291
00:12:02,157 --> 00:12:03,678
The round trip travel fee is all inclusive.

292
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:04,838
on

293
00:12:05,757 --> 00:12:07,037
The pay is a little low.

294
00:12:07,037 --> 00:12:07,958
Can be neglected.

295
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:09,397
Can you play?

296
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:10,718
Depends on the situation.

297
00:12:10,918 --> 00:12:11,637
to speak frankly

298
00:12:11,918 --> 00:12:13,117
To accompany the main force.

299
00:12:13,237 --> 00:12:14,318
Thank you.

300
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:16,397
You still think of us.

301
00:12:16,397 --> 00:12:17,037
I've told you

302
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:18,198
They wouldn't want to go.

303
00:12:18,798 --> 00:12:20,958
The main thing is that we can go to the benefits

304
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:22,997
The good thing is,

305
00:12:23,318 --> 00:12:25,237
We can torture each other again.

306
00:12:25,558 --> 00:12:26,237
Of course.

307
00:12:26,598 --> 00:12:27,918
Maybe in the future,

308
00:12:27,918 --> 00:12:29,318
You can torture others together.

309
00:12:30,718 --> 00:12:31,598
And,

310
00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:33,958
I missed you guys.

311
00:12:35,117 --> 00:12:36,078
I miss you too.

312
00:12:37,117 --> 00:12:37,918
It's disgusting.

313
00:12:38,718 --> 00:12:39,637
But I like it.

314
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:40,757
Oh, I'll go.

315
00:12:41,997 --> 00:12:42,598
I went there.

316
00:12:42,598 --> 00:12:43,318
And went to

317
00:12:43,318 --> 00:12:44,318
What? There's one.

318
00:12:44,318 --> 00:12:45,397
I mean, I'll go.

319
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:46,517
No, I'll go.

320
00:12:48,037 --> 00:12:48,838
I'll go too.

321
00:12:48,838 --> 00:12:49,438
you

322
00:12:49,678 --> 00:12:50,757
Where are you going?

323
00:12:50,757 --> 00:12:51,078
You...

324
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:53,678
You are a bunch of crazy people.

325
00:12:54,117 --> 00:12:56,357
Should we go crazy together again?

326
00:12:56,357 --> 00:12:57,078
That's right.

327
00:12:57,637 --> 00:12:58,918
Time and place.

328
00:12:58,918 --> 00:12:59,517
Also

329
00:12:59,718 --> 00:13:01,117
Book a better hotel for me.

330
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:03,757
wait a moment

331
00:13:04,678 --> 00:13:05,918
I want to introduce you to a new player.

332
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:07,318
Who's here?

333
00:13:08,678 --> 00:13:10,798
This new player

334
00:13:10,798 --> 00:13:12,198
Very unusual.

335
00:13:12,997 --> 00:13:14,517
Take a look.

336
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,277
Are you kidding us?

337
00:13:16,277 --> 00:13:17,277
Isn't this Lu Xiao Bei?

338
00:13:21,877 --> 00:13:23,277
Stand up, Lu Xiao Bei.

339
00:13:23,277 --> 00:13:24,958
You must have never seen it.

340
00:13:25,318 --> 00:13:26,277
dang!

341
00:13:28,037 --> 00:13:28,718
Take a look.

342
00:13:28,718 --> 00:13:29,558
Xiao Bei can do it.

343
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,318
Am I reading it correctly?

344
00:13:30,318 --> 00:13:30,958
What about

345
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,637
Lu Xiao Bei, you're so cool.

346
00:13:32,637 --> 00:13:33,598
How did you do that?

347
00:13:33,598 --> 00:13:34,678
Zero, zero.

348
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:36,517
Zero, zero.

349
00:13:36,798 --> 00:13:37,757
One, two, three.

350
00:13:37,997 --> 00:13:40,318
One, two, three.

351
00:13:40,718 --> 00:13:41,838
Yes, 1773.

352
00:13:48,598 --> 00:13:49,637
Four hundred and ninety-two.

353
00:13:50,117 --> 00:13:51,517
You got 492.

354
00:13:51,637 --> 00:13:52,678
very good

355
00:14:04,157 --> 00:14:04,877
You're back.

356
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:15,517
mom

357
00:14:17,037 --> 00:14:17,918
The result is out.

358
00:14:19,877 --> 00:14:21,237
Did you really think too much?

359
00:14:21,237 --> 00:14:21,958
How much?

360
00:14:22,397 --> 00:14:22,997
You're wrong.

361
00:14:23,877 --> 00:14:24,718
Five hundred and seventy-six.

362
00:14:24,918 --> 00:14:25,798
That's good.

363
00:14:26,598 --> 00:14:27,478
And eight points higher.

364
00:14:28,718 --> 00:14:29,318
mom

365
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,237
I want to apologize to you.

366
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,318
I really should go to a good university.

367
00:14:35,478 --> 00:14:36,517
Choose a good major.

368
00:14:37,558 --> 00:14:39,237
To find a good job after graduation.

369
00:14:39,757 --> 00:14:41,318
And live a safe life.

370
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,438
You and Dad will be relieved.

371
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:49,438
Do you really think so?

372
00:14:49,838 --> 00:14:50,877
I should think so.

373
00:14:51,438 --> 00:14:52,438
I can do the same.

374
00:14:53,277 --> 00:14:54,397
But this is not what I want.

375
00:14:57,117 --> 00:14:57,958
I don't hate reading.

376
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,117
And I don't hate college.

377
00:14:59,997 --> 00:15:01,078
I just want to try.

378
00:15:02,558 --> 00:15:03,997
I want to see how far I can go.

379
00:15:04,877 --> 00:15:05,478
You're right.

380
00:15:05,757 --> 00:15:06,798
Youth is precious.

381
00:15:08,757 --> 00:15:10,157
So I want to put my youth

382
00:15:11,237 --> 00:15:12,757
For the things I love the most.

383
00:15:13,598 --> 00:15:15,637
But even if you use it for the things you love the most,

384
00:15:15,637 --> 00:15:16,877
But also the reality.

385
00:15:17,558 --> 00:15:18,598
Sit down and tell me.

386
00:15:18,598 --> 00:15:19,078
mom

387
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:20,718
I've been sitting for ten years. I have had enough.

388
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:23,997
Now I can stand up.

389
00:15:26,637 --> 00:15:27,958
I'm going the way I want to go.

390
00:15:32,117 --> 00:15:32,718
One year.

391
00:15:32,877 --> 00:15:33,997
Just give me a year.

392
00:15:34,997 --> 00:15:35,757
If within a year,

393
00:15:35,757 --> 00:15:36,718
I can't get to e-sports.

394
00:15:37,157 --> 00:15:38,838
I will try my best to repeat the college entrance examination.

395
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,997
I can get 576 points this year.

396
00:15:40,997 --> 00:15:42,318
I won't be less than this next year.

397
00:15:45,997 --> 00:15:46,838
It seems

398
00:15:48,117 --> 00:15:49,838
Are you determined to go to Shenzhen?

399
00:15:52,397 --> 00:15:52,877
mom

400
00:15:53,397 --> 00:15:54,397
How did you know?

401
00:15:56,277 --> 00:15:57,558
Cheng Hao's mouth

402
00:15:57,877 --> 00:15:59,318
You never locked it.

403
00:16:00,037 --> 00:16:01,718
He told us immediately.

404
00:16:02,438 --> 00:16:04,997
I hope we can promise to support you.

405
00:16:06,157 --> 00:16:07,157
What do you think?

406
00:16:09,438 --> 00:16:10,718
What can I think?

407
00:16:12,117 --> 00:16:13,517
She must disagree.

408
00:16:19,877 --> 00:16:20,558
However

409
00:16:21,798 --> 00:16:23,237
Don't agree.

410
00:16:25,037 --> 00:16:26,598
You're already 19 years old.

411
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,277
I can't stop you.

412
00:16:44,517 --> 00:16:45,838
Why haven't you got any news?

413
00:16:52,757 --> 00:16:53,237
feed

414
00:16:53,517 --> 00:16:55,198
Did you get the scores?

415
00:16:56,918 --> 00:16:57,718
Four hundred and ninety-two.

416
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:04,078
Congratulations.

417
00:17:04,678 --> 00:17:06,558
You can tear the book without worry.

418
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,078
For a while

419
00:17:08,637 --> 00:17:09,598
Do you have a minute?

420
00:17:10,117 --> 00:17:11,478
If it's your treat,

421
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:12,757
There might be

422
00:17:13,277 --> 00:17:14,517
But ice lollies don't count.

423
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,757
There's a Japanese news near my home.

424
00:17:26,157 --> 00:17:26,958
Where are you going?

425
00:17:29,678 --> 00:17:30,757
I have an appointment with my classmates.

426
00:17:31,397 --> 00:17:32,198
What kind of date?

427
00:17:32,478 --> 00:17:33,838
You're not shy.

428
00:17:34,397 --> 00:17:35,237
What time is it?

429
00:17:36,117 --> 00:17:36,678
get home

430
00:17:37,237 --> 00:17:38,478
I'll have dinner with my classmates.

431
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,318
I told you to go home. Didn't you hear me?

432
00:17:41,198 --> 00:17:41,757
go

433
00:17:42,277 --> 00:17:42,838
Chu song

434
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:44,997
What's up

435
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:45,877
Who is it?

436
00:17:46,318 --> 00:17:46,918
Hello, Uncle.

437
00:17:46,918 --> 00:17:48,478
I'm a classmate of Chu Ge.

438
00:17:48,918 --> 00:17:49,838
Stay away from her.

439
00:17:49,838 --> 00:17:51,598
Don't come to her again.

440
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,237
Who are you looking for?

441
00:17:53,517 --> 00:17:54,718
Who does she want to see?

442
00:17:55,318 --> 00:17:56,318
This is our freedom.

443
00:17:56,838 --> 00:17:57,757
It's none of your business.

444
00:17:57,757 --> 00:17:58,798
I'm her father.

445
00:17:59,637 --> 00:18:01,757
Chu Ge is already 18 years old and has come of age.

446
00:18:01,757 --> 00:18:02,958
According to our laws,

447
00:18:03,198 --> 00:18:05,078
You have no right to limit her freedom.

448
00:18:05,078 --> 00:18:06,798
Don't mess with me.

449
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:07,918
Go away.

450
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,838
Believe it or not, I'll report you for harassing my daughter.

451
00:18:12,997 --> 00:18:13,718
Call the police

452
00:18:14,198 --> 00:18:14,798
good

453
00:18:15,318 --> 00:18:16,757
My dad is from Nanshan Police Station.

454
00:18:17,438 --> 00:18:18,877
But you'd better stay here

455
00:18:18,877 --> 00:18:19,757
Think about how to make it.

456
00:18:19,997 --> 00:18:20,877
Because you framed someone,

457
00:18:21,478 --> 00:18:22,198
Is against the law.

458
00:18:23,237 --> 00:18:24,438
What's so great about the police station?

459
00:18:26,237 --> 00:18:27,757
Who are you trying to scare?

460
00:18:28,478 --> 00:18:29,397
Touch me.

461
00:18:30,838 --> 00:18:32,237
I'll lie to you.

462
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:33,318
You can try it.

463
00:18:39,877 --> 00:18:40,558
a row

464
00:18:42,198 --> 00:18:43,718
I'll settle accounts with you when I get home.

465
00:18:45,598 --> 00:18:46,478
Please don't.

466
00:18:48,318 --> 00:18:49,598
It's illegal to hit someone.

467
00:18:49,877 --> 00:18:51,157
Domestic violence is more serious.

468
00:18:51,438 --> 00:18:53,157
If I see Chu Ge's injury again,

469
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:54,997
I'll call the police.

470
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:57,598
I'm the witness.

471
00:18:58,318 --> 00:18:58,877
Waiting

472
00:18:59,757 --> 00:19:00,277
Waiting

473
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:07,637
Aren't you scared?

474
00:19:08,877 --> 00:19:10,198
I just stood up for a day.

475
00:19:10,757 --> 00:19:12,357
A newborn calf is not afraid of tigers.

476
00:19:14,397 --> 00:19:15,357
You know the law well.

477
00:19:16,877 --> 00:19:18,117
My dad kept telling me

478
00:19:18,117 --> 00:19:19,117
I don't know. I know something.

479
00:19:22,598 --> 00:19:23,318
Correct!

480
00:19:23,438 --> 00:19:24,318
hear

481
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,037
You did well in the exam.

482
00:19:26,157 --> 00:19:27,198
hear

483
00:19:27,478 --> 00:19:29,478
Your score is more than enough to pass the exam.

484
00:19:30,198 --> 00:19:30,918
But you should

485
00:19:30,918 --> 00:19:33,037
Choose a university in Beijing or Shanghai.

486
00:19:33,558 --> 00:19:34,438
I have no idea

487
00:19:34,838 --> 00:19:35,517
It hasn't been decided yet.

488
00:19:36,997 --> 00:19:38,198
The Southern Team is in Shenzhen.

489
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:41,318
We may not have a chance to see each other again.

490
00:19:44,397 --> 00:19:44,718
Yes

491
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:46,798
The world is so big.

492
00:19:47,718 --> 00:19:48,718
It's my destiny.

493
00:19:49,478 --> 00:19:51,318
Then let's go.

494
00:19:51,318 --> 00:19:52,117
My treat

495
00:19:52,838 --> 00:19:53,198
go

496
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,438
After the farewell dinner,

497
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,358
Our high school life

498
00:20:06,358 --> 00:20:07,678
Even if it's over,

499
00:20:08,918 --> 00:20:09,718
Then I won't eat it.

500
00:20:13,678 --> 00:20:14,237
No more.

501
00:20:15,358 --> 00:20:16,037
Then I won't eat it.

502
00:20:18,757 --> 00:20:19,958
When you arrive in Shenzhen,

503
00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:21,277
Then treat me.

504
00:20:25,237 --> 00:20:26,958
Shenzhen has a team of Tencent e-sports games.

505
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,077
To sign a substitute team.

506
00:20:29,118 --> 00:20:30,277
We're going to have a try.

507
00:20:31,678 --> 00:20:32,757
You're not going to college?

508
00:20:32,757 --> 00:20:34,438
I'm going to give myself a year.

509
00:20:34,557 --> 00:20:36,358
If I don't have a career within a year,

510
00:20:36,638 --> 00:20:37,918
I'll come back to apply for college.

511
00:20:38,358 --> 00:20:39,638
I didn't tear the book anyway.

512
00:20:40,037 --> 00:20:40,878
Miss Bai said

513
00:20:41,037 --> 00:20:42,478
If I go back,

514
00:20:42,757 --> 00:20:43,638
The tuition fee is reduced.

515
00:20:45,638 --> 00:20:46,918
Then,

516
00:20:46,918 --> 00:20:48,718
You need to find a good temper.

517
00:20:49,037 --> 00:20:50,277
With you at the bottom,

518
00:20:50,638 --> 00:20:51,797
It's not that bad.

519
00:20:55,358 --> 00:20:56,237
Lu Xiao Bei,

520
00:20:59,198 --> 00:20:59,958
Thank you.

521
00:21:00,517 --> 00:21:01,678
I should thank you.

522
00:21:05,678 --> 00:21:06,878
All the classmates let me go.

523
00:21:08,997 --> 00:21:09,797
They pity me.

524
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,837
You're the only one who doesn't treat me as a cripple.

525
00:21:14,277 --> 00:21:15,277
Do you know

526
00:21:15,277 --> 00:21:16,517
What do you call us behind our backs?

527
00:21:17,158 --> 00:21:18,718
They call you the sprint lady.

528
00:21:19,597 --> 00:21:20,757
Call me a wheelchair freak.

529
00:21:20,918 --> 00:21:21,878
So the two of us

530
00:21:22,718 --> 00:21:24,638
Is a very clever combination.

531
00:21:40,797 --> 00:21:41,557
Bother you.

532
00:21:42,077 --> 00:21:42,837
Having dinner

533
00:21:47,757 --> 00:21:50,317
This young man

534
00:21:51,557 --> 00:21:52,517
Kittens

535
00:21:55,797 --> 00:21:57,118
After we win this game,

536
00:21:57,118 --> 00:21:58,478
Now ranked fifth.

537
00:21:58,478 --> 00:21:59,878
There are four games left.

538
00:21:59,878 --> 00:22:01,918
But there's only one place for the Inferno.

539
00:22:02,077 --> 00:22:04,118
So if we calculate the probability based on the integral,

540
00:22:04,118 --> 00:22:05,198
Just tell me the result.

541
00:22:05,517 --> 00:22:06,077
in other words

542
00:22:06,077 --> 00:22:07,918
We have to win the remaining four opponents.

543
00:22:07,918 --> 00:22:09,358
Including the Tiger Team.

544
00:22:09,757 --> 00:22:10,638
They are strong.

545
00:22:10,878 --> 00:22:11,757
Always ranked first.

546
00:22:11,918 --> 00:22:13,317
I saw them compete.

547
00:22:14,158 --> 00:22:16,277
There was almost no mistake.

548
00:22:16,797 --> 00:22:17,958
I heard that

549
00:22:18,277 --> 00:22:19,478
The mother of one of their players

550
00:22:19,478 --> 00:22:20,317
Died in a car accident.

551
00:22:20,478 --> 00:22:22,158
That's why I missed several hundred cities competitions.

552
00:22:22,158 --> 00:22:23,358
So I came to play the Hell Match.

553
00:22:23,478 --> 00:22:24,198
But it's good.

554
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:25,198
To meet such a strong opponent.

555
00:22:25,517 --> 00:22:26,118
It's not for nothing.

556
00:22:26,317 --> 00:22:27,678
But we can't lose.

557
00:22:27,678 --> 00:22:29,398
If you lose, you will be dismissed.

558
00:22:29,837 --> 00:22:30,398
monkey

559
00:22:30,918 --> 00:22:32,037
Have you booked the tickets?

560
00:22:32,037 --> 00:22:33,918
I decided to stay a few more days.

561
00:22:33,918 --> 00:22:35,997
After you finish the game.

562
00:22:35,997 --> 00:22:37,277
If something goes wrong,

563
00:22:37,277 --> 00:22:37,997
I can still

564
00:22:38,277 --> 00:22:38,837
Take it.

565
00:22:39,997 --> 00:22:41,478
Maybe we can go back together.

566
00:22:41,478 --> 00:22:42,797
Don't be so rude.

567
00:22:43,597 --> 00:22:44,797
I'm counting now.

568
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:46,718
The results of all our games

569
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,237
So that we can calculate the probability of winning.

570
00:22:49,237 --> 00:22:50,237
Forget it.

571
00:22:50,478 --> 00:22:51,918
This is not a math problem.

572
00:22:51,918 --> 00:22:53,958
No matter how accurate you are, you are not as reliable as me.

573
00:23:00,557 --> 00:23:01,118
Did you read it?

574
00:23:01,317 --> 00:23:01,958
win

575
00:23:03,317 --> 00:23:04,718
Did you change just now?

576
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:05,198
No

577
00:23:05,198 --> 00:23:06,237
Come on. Cheers.

578
00:23:20,557 --> 00:23:21,317
Nothing

579
00:23:22,077 --> 00:23:23,557
Xiao Feng was joking.

580
00:23:23,678 --> 00:23:24,837
Don't take it to heart.

581
00:23:26,557 --> 00:23:27,638
I'm not angry.

582
00:23:27,797 --> 00:23:29,557
I just feel I can't do anything.

583
00:23:36,918 --> 00:23:38,158
You listen to his song?

584
00:23:38,398 --> 00:23:39,958
A perfect student also listens to his songs.

585
00:23:40,757 --> 00:23:42,277
I started with his first album.

586
00:23:42,277 --> 00:23:43,118
I like him.

587
00:23:43,478 --> 00:23:44,997
He was not famous at that time.

588
00:24:00,277 --> 00:24:01,118
Dinner is ready.

589
00:24:01,118 --> 00:24:02,358
I've been looking for you two for a long time.

590
00:24:02,718 --> 00:24:03,517
is or isn't

591
00:24:03,797 --> 00:24:05,718
What are you talking about behind my back?

592
00:24:07,037 --> 00:24:08,718
We're talking about music.

593
00:24:18,118 --> 00:24:19,037
What is this?

594
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:20,438
I can't understand a word.

595
00:24:20,837 --> 00:24:22,837
You can't even spell it clearly.

596
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:25,237
It's called RAP. It is also called rap.

597
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:26,678
Do you understand?

598
00:24:28,118 --> 00:24:29,478
It's quite tongue-tied.

599
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:30,997
A song is not finished.

600
00:24:30,997 --> 00:24:32,438
My tongue has become a bowknot.

601
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,277
Don't pretend to understand.

602
00:24:34,478 --> 00:24:36,878
Rap is a style of hip-hop music.

603
00:24:36,878 --> 00:24:38,878
It's different from what you said.

604
00:24:39,037 --> 00:24:39,638
Rap music.

605
00:24:39,638 --> 00:24:41,757
And the black culture on the streets of America.

606
00:24:49,438 --> 00:24:51,478
It has nothing to do with the singing and talking

607
00:24:51,478 --> 00:24:52,557
What's the difference?

608
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:53,237
right or wrong?

609
00:25:02,478 --> 00:25:04,638
Is there anything going on between you two?

610
00:25:09,237 --> 00:25:09,997
You're shy.

611
00:25:10,277 --> 00:25:11,797
Do you want me to introduce you two?

612
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:15,198
I don't want you to make a joke like this.

613
00:25:15,718 --> 00:25:16,198
Ann

614
00:25:19,597 --> 00:25:20,837
Don't you want to?

615
00:25:21,718 --> 00:25:22,358
Listen to this.

616
00:25:22,837 --> 00:25:24,597
I don't like your jokes at all.

617
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:28,118
AnLuan

618
00:25:35,557 --> 00:25:36,118
Shenzhen

619
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:37,198
We're here.

620
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:39,757
Now we are short of S + 1.

621
00:25:39,757 --> 00:25:40,797
It shouldn't be.

622
00:25:41,398 --> 00:25:42,718
Her train should have arrived early.

623
00:25:42,718 --> 00:25:44,277
Did she come out from the south entrance?

624
00:25:44,277 --> 00:25:44,958
Really?

625
00:25:46,158 --> 00:25:46,757
Is that

626
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:48,158
No, that's too short.

627
00:25:48,317 --> 00:25:49,438
The green one?

628
00:25:50,037 --> 00:25:51,198
No, she's not that fat.

629
00:25:51,198 --> 00:25:51,918
That...

630
00:25:52,037 --> 00:25:52,678
Su Jiayi.

631
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:53,678
sister

632
00:25:55,517 --> 00:25:56,597
Shout louder.

633
00:25:57,678 --> 00:25:58,198
Isn't that

634
00:25:58,198 --> 00:25:59,077
Seriously?

635
00:25:59,077 --> 00:25:59,718
Su Jiayi.

636
00:26:00,277 --> 00:26:00,918
No, don't shout.

637
00:26:03,158 --> 00:26:04,118
The Crown Prince.

638
00:26:04,918 --> 00:26:05,878
How dare you scare me?

639
00:26:06,438 --> 00:26:08,198
How dare you scare me?

640
00:26:08,198 --> 00:26:08,557
Let me do it.

641
00:26:08,557 --> 00:26:09,478
How dare you scare me?

642
00:26:13,837 --> 00:26:15,678
Wait

643
00:26:15,678 --> 00:26:16,597
It's me.

644
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:17,918
It's me.

645
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:19,358
It's me.

646
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:20,557
sister

647
00:26:21,517 --> 00:26:21,958
you

648
00:26:23,198 --> 00:26:24,317
Be careful

649
00:26:24,597 --> 00:26:25,797
I miss you so much.

650
00:26:25,797 --> 00:26:26,797
You just

651
00:26:27,597 --> 00:26:28,438
So hard.

652
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:29,597
To greet me like this.

653
00:26:30,918 --> 00:26:32,398
It's quite tall to stand up.

654
00:26:32,678 --> 00:26:33,237
He's handsome.

655
00:26:34,317 --> 00:26:35,678
Do you still want this equipment?

656
00:26:37,198 --> 00:26:38,718
How are you? Did you miss me?

657
00:26:42,597 --> 00:26:43,517
I've thought about it.

658
00:26:43,597 --> 00:26:44,478
How much do you think?

659
00:26:47,118 --> 00:26:48,237
I really want to.

660
00:26:48,797 --> 00:26:49,797
I missed you too.

661
00:26:53,158 --> 00:26:53,638
big sister

662
00:26:53,718 --> 00:26:54,797
Why don't you find a black bag?

663
00:26:54,797 --> 00:26:56,557
It's much easier to cover your head.

664
00:26:57,077 --> 00:26:57,958
You don't understand.

665
00:26:57,958 --> 00:26:59,837
Stars are wearing this when they go out.

666
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:02,077
If you are recognized by fans on the road,

667
00:27:02,077 --> 00:27:02,517
How to do it?

668
00:27:04,158 --> 00:27:05,797
Beauty, you must be Su Jiayi.

669
00:27:05,997 --> 00:27:07,438
Yes, I'm Su Jiayi.

670
00:27:07,638 --> 00:27:09,358
I brought a pen. Do you want to sign?

671
00:27:09,517 --> 00:27:10,317
Tell me now.

672
00:27:10,317 --> 00:27:11,198
What's your name

673
00:27:11,198 --> 00:27:11,517
No, no.

674
00:27:11,517 --> 00:27:12,317
How about I sign a name for you?

675
00:27:12,317 --> 00:27:12,958
Su Jiayi.

676
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:13,358
Go ahead.

677
00:27:13,358 --> 00:27:13,797
No need

678
00:27:13,797 --> 00:27:14,918
He is the driver of our team.

679
00:27:16,517 --> 00:27:17,277
Let's go.

680
00:27:17,277 --> 00:27:17,997
And fans.

681
00:27:17,997 --> 00:27:19,638
I'm returning the shredded kelp.

682
00:27:22,237 --> 00:27:22,958
Su Jiayi.

683
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:25,277
Here's something for you.

684
00:27:37,878 --> 00:27:38,797
We're here.

685
00:27:45,077 --> 00:27:45,638
Hello, President Guo.

686
00:27:45,878 --> 00:27:46,597
I'm Lu Xiao Bei.

687
00:27:46,718 --> 00:27:47,358
Welcome to join us.

688
00:27:47,638 --> 00:27:48,878
This is our southern monster.

689
00:27:48,997 --> 00:27:49,678
Let's go.

690
00:27:49,678 --> 00:27:50,918
I'll show you around.

691
00:28:01,918 --> 00:28:03,438
It's the same as my chair.

692
00:28:06,237 --> 00:28:07,597
This is the main area.

693
00:28:07,757 --> 00:28:09,037
Yours are over here.

694
00:28:11,517 --> 00:28:12,198
Let's go.

695
00:28:12,198 --> 00:28:13,317
I'll show you around.

696
00:28:16,597 --> 00:28:18,198
These are the dorms.

697
00:28:20,277 --> 00:28:21,597
This is not your room.

698
00:28:21,718 --> 00:28:22,557
Your room.

699
00:28:22,837 --> 00:28:23,597
In other places,

700
00:28:25,158 --> 00:28:26,277
There's a basement.

701
00:28:29,237 --> 00:28:30,158
How about this place?

702
00:28:30,317 --> 00:28:31,438
You're here.

703
00:28:37,878 --> 00:28:38,277
President Guo.

704
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:39,837
Is this the only one?

705
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:41,118
No

706
00:28:41,718 --> 00:28:43,077
Didn't we have a deal?

707
00:28:43,398 --> 00:28:44,517
There is a female player in our team.

708
00:28:44,837 --> 00:28:45,837
It doesn't matter to the four of us.

709
00:28:46,237 --> 00:28:47,077
But the female players

710
00:28:47,077 --> 00:28:48,398
There must be a separate room.

711
00:28:49,198 --> 00:28:49,638
this

712
00:28:49,638 --> 00:28:51,478
This is the only place in the club.

713
00:28:51,478 --> 00:28:53,077
I'm not a real estate agent.

714
00:28:53,077 --> 00:28:54,958
Where can I make another room for you?

715
00:28:55,237 --> 00:28:55,918
The key is here.

716
00:28:55,918 --> 00:28:56,557
I'll put it here.

717
00:28:56,797 --> 00:28:57,037
Do it yourself.

718
00:28:57,037 --> 00:28:57,597
President Guo.

719
00:28:58,718 --> 00:28:59,878
We signed the contract.

720
00:29:00,918 --> 00:29:02,198
The contract is dead.

721
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,077
We are all alive, right?

722
00:29:04,158 --> 00:29:05,557
I'm busy. I have to go.

723
00:29:14,478 --> 00:29:14,878
this

724
00:29:15,317 --> 00:29:16,118
What are you doing?

725
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:17,037
Eye mask

726
00:29:17,158 --> 00:29:18,037
to accept

727
00:29:18,037 --> 00:29:19,678
Five people living together.

728
00:29:19,797 --> 00:29:20,997
So I shouldn't have seen it.

729
00:29:21,037 --> 00:29:22,878
You can't show it to me.

730
00:29:23,958 --> 00:29:24,958
This... I usually

731
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:26,118
You can't see the way.

732
00:29:26,118 --> 00:29:26,997
I can't see anything.

733
00:29:26,997 --> 00:29:27,997
Are you stupid?

734
00:29:27,997 --> 00:29:29,237
I didn't ask you to wear it now.

735
00:29:30,797 --> 00:29:31,158
Correct!

736
00:29:31,517 --> 00:29:33,277
This is the timetable.

737
00:29:33,277 --> 00:29:33,918
Take a look.

738
00:29:33,918 --> 00:29:34,837
dang!

739
00:29:35,037 --> 00:29:37,398
Wake up at 8: 00 and be at the training room at 9.

740
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:38,317
Don't you play hard?

741
00:29:38,317 --> 00:29:39,358
Who can bear it?

742
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:43,997
From 11: 30 to 10 PM, I will train with the main force.

743
00:29:44,198 --> 00:29:46,158
Why are we getting up at eight?

744
00:29:46,158 --> 00:29:47,878
The main force didn't start training until half past eleven.

745
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:48,958
Namely

746
00:29:49,237 --> 00:29:50,678
You'll be deducted for being late.

747
00:29:51,678 --> 00:29:52,718
Get used to it.

748
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:53,958
Now?

749
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:54,878
It's Tencent Esports Games.

750
00:29:55,277 --> 00:29:56,077
It's semi-professional.

751
00:29:56,358 --> 00:29:58,198
It must be different when we fought against Hundred Cities.

752
00:29:58,358 --> 00:30:00,478
The higher you go, the more formal you will be.

753
00:30:00,678 --> 00:30:02,997
I'm afraid it will be more than that.

754
00:30:03,918 --> 00:30:04,317
Correct!

755
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:07,037
This should be our team uniform.

756
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,958
From now on, everything will be normal.

757
00:30:10,718 --> 00:30:12,037
I'm already half drunk.

758
00:30:12,037 --> 00:30:13,757
Don't ask me to drink more.

759
00:30:13,757 --> 00:30:14,718
I can't stand it.

760
00:30:16,037 --> 00:30:17,198
Tell him to go himself.

761
00:30:17,198 --> 00:30:17,997
I'm not going.

762
00:30:18,438 --> 00:30:19,277
Hello.

763
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:21,837
We are the new replacements.

764
00:30:22,837 --> 00:30:24,198
These idiots

765
00:30:24,317 --> 00:30:25,958
You didn't compete. What uniform do you wear?

766
00:30:27,037 --> 00:30:27,638
What did he say?

767
00:30:28,438 --> 00:30:29,158
go

768
00:30:31,918 --> 00:30:32,678
garbage

769
00:30:33,757 --> 00:30:34,358
Pack up.

770
00:30:34,557 --> 00:30:35,237
What are you talking about?

771
00:30:37,198 --> 00:30:37,757
Forget it.

772
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:39,918
Pack up.

773
00:30:42,597 --> 00:30:43,398
today

774
00:30:43,557 --> 00:30:45,557
I want you to get familiar with it.

775
00:30:45,557 --> 00:30:46,077
Liuxu

776
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:47,317
What are the training requirements?

777
00:30:47,317 --> 00:30:48,797
Tell Xiao Bei directly.

778
00:30:49,438 --> 00:30:50,237
He...

779
00:30:50,438 --> 00:30:51,118
a row

780
00:30:51,678 --> 00:30:52,878
Choose a picture to warm up.

781
00:30:52,958 --> 00:30:54,797
To see if she's strong enough to be a sparring partner.

782
00:30:55,198 --> 00:30:56,438
Xiao Bei played well.

783
00:30:56,597 --> 00:30:58,797
The Ning Jiang Team almost qualified this year.

784
00:31:00,077 --> 00:31:00,958
Boss

785
00:31:01,438 --> 00:31:04,237
Although there's a difference between 10 yuan and 100 yuan,

786
00:31:04,597 --> 00:31:05,837
Sometimes it's so close.

787
00:31:06,277 --> 00:31:07,878
It's so much worse.

788
00:31:10,237 --> 00:31:11,678
Are we worth 10 yuan?

789
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:13,198
Or 100 yuan?

790
00:31:14,158 --> 00:31:14,918
Take a look.

791
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:16,718
Come on.

792
00:32:01,077 --> 00:32:02,557
How about you?

793
00:32:02,757 --> 00:32:04,037
That's all.

794
00:32:04,118 --> 00:32:06,317
How could you say you almost crossed the line?

795
00:32:06,317 --> 00:32:08,678
Ning Jiang Team is too weak.

796
00:32:08,757 --> 00:32:09,317
Boss

797
00:32:09,478 --> 00:32:10,797
With the money,

798
00:32:11,037 --> 00:32:13,358
It's better to make you delicious and delicious.

799
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:15,158
Xiao Bei just arrived today.

800
00:32:15,158 --> 00:32:16,158
Please leave a message.

801
00:32:16,158 --> 00:32:17,317
Don't mention it.

802
00:32:17,317 --> 00:32:18,918
As long as we can practice the tactics of the main force,

803
00:32:18,918 --> 00:32:20,158
It doesn't matter if you win or lose.

804
00:32:21,198 --> 00:32:22,757
Weak chicken is weak chicken.

805
00:32:22,757 --> 00:32:24,638
You really know how to find a way out.

806
00:32:24,757 --> 00:32:25,517
What are you talking about?

807
00:32:25,517 --> 00:32:25,878
Kai

808
00:32:30,597 --> 00:32:32,438
Look, we are too far forward.

809
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:33,438
Nezha can't keep up with it.

810
00:32:34,557 --> 00:32:35,158
The power is off.

811
00:32:35,478 --> 00:32:36,517
It must be Liu Xu.

812
00:32:36,837 --> 00:32:37,757
I would hate to see him.

813
00:32:37,918 --> 00:32:38,597
Go find him.

814
00:32:43,557 --> 00:32:43,757
Get out

815
00:32:43,757 --> 00:32:44,638
sorry

816
00:32:44,638 --> 00:32:45,797
I didn't mean to.

817
00:32:47,557 --> 00:32:48,198
Kai

818
00:32:48,918 --> 00:32:50,118
Go fight with them.

819
00:32:50,438 --> 00:32:51,678
All the more reason for them to kick us out.

820
00:32:52,997 --> 00:32:54,077
What can we do

821
00:32:54,277 --> 00:32:55,878
Eye mask

822
00:32:57,438 --> 00:32:58,797
Call the property management first.

823
00:32:58,797 --> 00:32:59,997
And go to the training room.

824
00:32:59,997 --> 00:33:01,077
There must be electricity in the training room.

825
00:33:01,198 --> 00:33:02,037
Who can't sleep.

826
00:33:02,358 --> 00:33:03,198
Go to practice shooting.

827
00:33:03,198 --> 00:33:03,878
dang!

828
00:33:03,878 --> 00:33:04,597
I'll go too.

829
00:33:04,597 --> 00:33:05,837
Hold on. I'll get a charging cable.

830
00:33:06,198 --> 00:33:06,918
Let's go.

831
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,997
What should I do if you leave?

832
00:33:08,997 --> 00:33:10,358
Wait for me. I'll get you some hot water.

833
00:33:12,118 --> 00:33:12,918
What is this?

834
00:33:13,478 --> 00:33:14,118
What is this?

835
00:33:14,237 --> 00:33:15,277
My ass.

836
00:33:15,517 --> 00:33:16,438
Kick you to death.

837
00:33:16,438 --> 00:33:17,638
Who is this?

838
00:33:17,638 --> 00:33:18,398
Where is the door?

839
00:33:18,517 --> 00:33:19,678
Let's go. Follow me.

840
00:33:20,118 --> 00:33:20,638
Kay?

841
00:33:20,638 --> 00:33:21,158
Yes

842
00:33:21,158 --> 00:33:22,037
Let's go.

843
00:33:22,037 --> 00:33:22,678
Be careful, Bei.

844
00:33:22,678 --> 00:33:23,557
Cheng Hao, follow me.

845
00:33:34,118 --> 00:33:35,797
Southern Sports University

846
00:33:35,797 --> 00:33:37,037
You're finally admitted.

847
00:33:38,557 --> 00:33:39,837
When you start school,

848
00:33:39,837 --> 00:33:41,597
I'll buy you some new clothes.

849
00:33:41,597 --> 00:33:43,277
And buy a quilt and a mattress.

850
00:33:43,277 --> 00:33:45,077
And buy something you like.

851
00:33:45,077 --> 00:33:46,277
Are dead.

852
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:49,958
What are you looking at?

853
00:33:50,557 --> 00:33:51,358
to bring

854
00:33:54,757 --> 00:33:56,638
Southern Sports University

855
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:58,718
You're really promising.

856
00:33:59,118 --> 00:34:00,997
And got into a famous university.

857
00:34:03,517 --> 00:34:05,557
The annual tuition is more than 8,000 yuan.

858
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:06,718
Give it back.

859
00:34:06,918 --> 00:34:08,118
I'll figure out my own way.

860
00:34:08,118 --> 00:34:09,037
I won't cost you any money.

861
00:34:09,158 --> 00:34:10,398
Who are you spending your money on?

862
00:34:13,517 --> 00:34:14,517
Did you really pass the exam?

863
00:34:14,517 --> 00:34:14,878
Are you drunk?

864
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:15,557
Did you really go to college?

865
00:34:15,557 --> 00:34:16,997
Go back to your room and rest.

866
00:34:16,997 --> 00:34:17,678
all right?

867
00:34:17,678 --> 00:34:18,678
Go away.

868
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:21,997
Go back to your room.

869
00:34:22,237 --> 00:34:22,638
to bring

870
00:34:23,237 --> 00:34:23,517
It's so late.

871
00:34:23,517 --> 00:34:24,438
to bring

872
00:34:24,678 --> 00:34:25,438
Stop it, okay?

873
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:26,398
Who is it?

874
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:27,478
to bring

875
00:34:28,237 --> 00:34:28,837
Bring it here.

876
00:34:28,837 --> 00:34:29,718
That's her admission letter.

877
00:34:29,718 --> 00:34:30,158
Bring it here.

878
00:34:30,158 --> 00:34:31,317
She still needs it for college.

879
00:34:31,478 --> 00:34:32,557
What?

880
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:34,918
I have the final say.

881
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:41,878
It's not easy for her to go to college.

882
00:34:42,037 --> 00:34:43,638
Why don't you let her go?

883
00:34:44,678 --> 00:34:47,037
She didn't have to spend a penny of her family's money to go to college.

884
00:34:47,277 --> 00:34:48,317
I want to divorce you.

885
00:34:48,997 --> 00:34:50,317
And let her go to college.

886
00:34:57,837 --> 00:35:00,237
I'll let you go to college now.

887
00:35:12,837 --> 00:35:13,958
What do you want to do?

888
00:35:15,198 --> 00:35:15,997
What are you doing?

889
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:19,237
to boil

890
00:35:19,237 --> 00:35:20,517
If you touch my mother again,

891
00:35:20,797 --> 00:35:22,757
If you touch my mother again, I'll kill you.

892
00:35:24,797 --> 00:35:26,118
You are so brave.

893
00:35:27,398 --> 00:35:28,757
How dare you fight with me?

894
00:35:29,438 --> 00:35:29,918
Try it.

895
00:35:48,878 --> 00:35:49,757
We'll see.

896
00:35:54,358 --> 00:35:55,037
stop

897
00:35:57,517 --> 00:35:58,557
Apologize to my mom.

898
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:03,158
apologize

899
00:36:13,398 --> 00:36:13,878
I

900
00:36:16,358 --> 00:36:17,398
I was drunk

901
00:36:20,158 --> 00:36:20,997
sorry

902
00:36:26,638 --> 00:36:27,358
I'm sorry, okay?

903
00:38:03,878 --> 00:38:04,918
Put it on and run faster.

904
00:38:05,077 --> 00:38:06,318
Don't let others catch up with you.

905
00:39:09,637 --> 00:39:10,117
I'll do it.

906
00:39:12,398 --> 00:39:12,918
If you don't break it,

907
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:13,958
I'm thankful.

908
00:39:14,918 --> 00:39:15,637
Give it to me.

909
00:39:18,798 --> 00:39:19,637
It's just wrapped.

910
00:39:19,798 --> 00:39:20,517
Watch this.

911
00:39:21,077 --> 00:39:21,958
What are you doing?

912
00:39:28,838 --> 00:39:30,077
You're disgusting.

913
00:39:30,438 --> 00:39:31,398
You don't understand.

914
00:39:31,878 --> 00:39:32,398
Look.

915
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:35,197
Isn't it fixed?

916
00:39:35,278 --> 00:39:35,478
come

917
00:39:35,878 --> 00:39:36,398
I'll wear it for you.

918
00:39:42,478 --> 00:39:44,478
It's much better than that tape.

919
00:39:44,958 --> 00:39:46,358
And the receiver.

920
00:39:49,878 --> 00:39:51,117
Why are you still angry?

921
00:39:51,117 --> 00:39:53,077
I don't have time to be angry. I'm busy.

922
00:39:53,238 --> 00:39:54,677
Don't waste your time on this.

923
00:39:54,798 --> 00:39:55,318
go

924
00:39:55,318 --> 00:39:56,438
I'll treat you to a movie.

925
00:39:56,958 --> 00:39:57,918
Transformers

926
00:39:57,918 --> 00:39:58,637
American blockbuster

927
00:39:58,958 --> 00:40:00,597
The game has come to this point.

928
00:40:00,597 --> 00:40:01,758
You still want to go to the movies?

929
00:40:01,878 --> 00:40:03,597
Where is the optimism and confidence?

930
00:40:06,077 --> 00:40:08,037
You've been looking so sad all night.

931
00:40:08,037 --> 00:40:09,958
You won't have an easy game tomorrow.

932
00:40:10,278 --> 00:40:11,798
Captain, they are still nervous when they see you.

933
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:14,318
Pressure is an infectious disease.

934
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:15,717
The cross-infection is scarier.

935
00:40:16,077 --> 00:40:17,798
So as a leader,

936
00:40:17,798 --> 00:40:20,197
The more relaxed you are at this point.

937
00:40:20,197 --> 00:40:21,478
Only when you work and rest can you fight.

938
00:40:21,478 --> 00:40:22,117
Do you understand?

939
00:40:30,238 --> 00:40:31,157
Pack up.

940
00:40:31,157 --> 00:40:32,517
I'll buy a ticket.

941
00:40:35,117 --> 00:40:36,278
Hurry up.

942
00:40:38,997 --> 00:40:40,478
I'll wait for you at the door.

943
00:40:44,878 --> 00:40:46,117
You must come.

944
00:41:03,758 --> 00:41:04,157
you

945
00:41:04,717 --> 00:41:06,157
What's wrong with your keyboard?

946
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,918
The keys W and A don't work well.

947
00:41:13,398 --> 00:41:13,838
In my opinion,

948
00:41:16,117 --> 00:41:17,758
Hold on. Press it.

949
00:41:17,758 --> 00:41:18,677
I'll get you something.

950
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:18,997
good

951
00:41:27,958 --> 00:41:28,717
It's done.

952
00:41:34,278 --> 00:41:36,398
What are you doing?

953
00:41:40,037 --> 00:41:40,878
That's it.

954
00:41:43,958 --> 00:41:45,278
There's no rebound.

955
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:46,677
I remember this area.

956
00:41:46,677 --> 00:41:48,438
There seems to be a shop selling computer accessories.

957
00:41:48,438 --> 00:41:49,478
I'll have a look later.

958
00:41:49,478 --> 00:41:50,398
What time is it?

959
00:41:50,398 --> 00:41:51,758
It's so late. The door is closed.

960
00:41:51,758 --> 00:41:53,117
Open again tomorrow. It's already 10: 00.

961
00:41:53,318 --> 00:41:54,318
It's okay. There must be a way.

962
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:55,077
I'll go.

963
00:41:58,478 --> 00:41:59,358
Come on.

964
00:42:08,037 --> 00:42:08,717
feed

965
00:42:09,117 --> 00:42:09,717
son

966
00:42:09,717 --> 00:42:10,878
I'm your grandfather.

967
00:42:11,677 --> 00:42:12,637
Why are you here?

968
00:42:12,637 --> 00:42:13,238
Where is An Lan?

969
00:42:13,238 --> 00:42:15,637
She left her phone here in a hurry.

970
00:42:16,037 --> 00:42:17,077
Tell me if you need anything.

971
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:17,918
Come back and tell her.

972
00:42:17,918 --> 00:42:18,717
It's nothing.

973
00:42:19,117 --> 00:42:19,637
Nothing

974
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:29,358
sorry

975
00:42:33,037 --> 00:42:33,878
Fight.

976
00:42:57,077 --> 00:42:58,398
Where did you get it?

977
00:42:58,597 --> 00:42:59,918
I rented it from the internet café next door.

978
00:42:59,918 --> 00:43:00,677
Five yuan a day.

979
00:43:00,958 --> 00:43:02,077
You're really something.

980
00:43:02,517 --> 00:43:03,278
Sure.

981
00:43:03,278 --> 00:43:03,997
can

982
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:08,197
I forgot about the movie.

983
00:43:09,478 --> 00:43:10,238
Nothing

984
00:43:10,238 --> 00:43:10,958
I'm telling you,

985
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:12,037
You didn't go to the movie.

986
00:43:12,037 --> 00:43:13,197
You lost a lot, you know?

987
00:43:13,197 --> 00:43:15,557
As soon as the movie starts,

988
00:43:15,557 --> 00:43:17,597
All the weapons of all the people.

989
00:43:17,597 --> 00:43:18,677
It's amazing.

990
00:43:18,717 --> 00:43:19,597
You should regret it.

991
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:21,918
To be honest, I don't really like popcorn movies.

992
00:43:22,358 --> 00:43:23,557
Why didn't you go to Up?

993
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:24,597
What is that?

994
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:25,157
Up

995
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:26,197
Up

996
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:27,157
What?

997
00:43:27,197 --> 00:43:28,037
Up

998
00:43:28,117 --> 00:43:29,157
A name translated into Chinese.

999
00:43:29,157 --> 00:43:30,278
It's called Flying House.

1000
00:43:30,278 --> 00:43:31,997
The new animated feature is very good.

1001
00:43:31,997 --> 00:43:33,037
Has a good reputation.

1002
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:34,278
If you want to watch cartoons,

1003
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,918
You can look at Pleasant Goat and Grey Wolf online.

1004
00:43:35,918 --> 00:43:37,677
The cartoons are for kids.

1005
00:43:37,677 --> 00:43:39,597
Haven't you seen Pixar cartoons?

1006
00:43:39,758 --> 00:43:41,438
Adults love to watch that.

1007
00:43:41,517 --> 00:43:42,958
You also like to watch that cartoon.

1008
00:43:43,318 --> 00:43:43,838
I like it,too

1009
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:44,717
Especially Finding Nemo.

1010
00:43:44,717 --> 00:43:46,637
And the General Motors.

1011
00:43:46,637 --> 00:43:47,798
You also like Finding Nemo.

1012
00:43:47,798 --> 00:43:48,997
I really like it.

1013
00:43:48,997 --> 00:43:50,358
I really like Nemo.

1014
00:43:50,358 --> 00:43:51,798
I bought a lot of Nemo merchandise.

1015
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:52,278
Me too.

1016
00:43:52,278 --> 00:43:54,318
I also bought Nemo's small sheet.

1017
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:55,077
I sleep every day.

1018
00:43:55,878 --> 00:43:56,557
That feeling.

1019
00:43:56,557 --> 00:43:57,358
It's like the ocean.

1020
00:43:57,358 --> 00:43:57,838
to step aside

1021
00:43:57,838 --> 00:43:58,157
No

1022
00:43:58,157 --> 00:43:58,637
If I had known,

1023
00:43:58,637 --> 00:43:59,878
So I put my Nemo stickers

1024
00:43:59,878 --> 00:44:00,758
I've sent them to you.

1025
00:44:00,758 --> 00:44:01,758
You have a sticker.

1026
00:44:01,758 --> 00:44:03,478
I'll post it on WSAD.

1027
00:44:03,478 --> 00:44:05,677
My WSAD are all little Nemos.

1028
00:44:05,677 --> 00:44:07,358
Do you remember the blue fish inside?

1029
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:09,238
I remember it as his good friend.

1030
00:44:09,238 --> 00:44:09,918
What's his name?

1031
00:44:10,117 --> 00:44:10,798
I forgot what it's called.

1032
00:44:10,798 --> 00:44:11,918
Anyway, it's a good friend.

1033
00:44:11,918 --> 00:44:12,438
Dolly

1034
00:44:12,717 --> 00:44:13,597
Yes, Dolly.

1035
00:44:13,597 --> 00:44:14,318
And the two of them.

1036
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,918
When I got into the shark's mouth,

1037
00:44:15,918 --> 00:44:17,318
Yes, the shark is swimming.

1038
00:44:18,918 --> 00:44:19,278
Are you scared?

1039
00:44:19,278 --> 00:44:21,157
And the kids in the fish tank.

1040
00:44:25,157 --> 00:44:25,637
Come on.

1041
00:44:26,398 --> 00:44:27,758
Don't take too long.

1042
00:44:42,077 --> 00:44:42,958
Something's on your mind.

1043
00:44:42,997 --> 00:44:43,758
Where is it?

1044
00:44:43,758 --> 00:44:44,478
No

1045
00:44:44,478 --> 00:44:45,798
Someone in my heart

1046
00:44:46,677 --> 00:44:47,798
She's pretending to be a girl.

1047
00:44:48,878 --> 00:44:49,717
to talk drivel

1048
00:44:50,278 --> 00:44:51,438
One is not enough.

1049
00:44:51,717 --> 00:44:52,637
I have a big heart.

1050
00:44:52,637 --> 00:44:53,597
Three rooms and two rooms.

1051
00:44:53,677 --> 00:44:54,958
At least seven or eight.

1052
00:44:56,157 --> 00:44:57,037
Forget about it.

1053
00:44:57,717 --> 00:44:58,517
You...

1054
00:44:58,878 --> 00:44:59,478
You can't lie.

1055
00:45:00,878 --> 00:45:01,358
Is there?

1056
00:45:02,597 --> 00:45:03,758
I like them.

1057
00:45:04,117 --> 00:45:05,037
It's written on your face.

1058
00:45:08,838 --> 00:45:10,278
What's the use of liking?

1059
00:45:10,637 --> 00:45:11,798
Don't have the same hobby.

1060
00:45:12,278 --> 00:45:13,557
Are not from the same world.

1061
00:45:15,798 --> 00:45:17,157
Two identical people.

1062
00:45:17,157 --> 00:45:18,398
Don't you need to like each other?

1063
00:45:18,798 --> 00:45:20,398
Why don't you go back and look in the mirror?

1064
00:45:20,597 --> 00:45:21,677
The magnet

1065
00:45:21,997 --> 00:45:22,997
The same pole.

1066
00:45:23,318 --> 00:45:24,358
Heterogenous adsorption

1067
00:45:24,717 --> 00:45:25,717
That's also true of relationships.

1068
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:29,278
to make sense

1069
00:45:29,878 --> 00:45:30,958
Haven't you ever been in a relationship?

1070
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:31,878
You're still coaching me.

1071
00:45:32,637 --> 00:45:33,637
I've never eaten pork before.

1072
00:45:33,637 --> 00:45:34,798
But I've seen pigs run.

1073
00:45:36,557 --> 00:45:37,438
Who is the pig?

1074
00:45:40,117 --> 00:45:40,597
It's over.

1075
00:45:41,517 --> 00:45:42,318
We haven't seen each other for a while.

1076
00:45:43,557 --> 00:45:44,438
What are you doing recently?

1077
00:45:44,758 --> 00:45:45,878
I just arrived in Shenzhen for a few days.

1078
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:46,677
Shenzhen

1079
00:45:47,318 --> 00:45:48,238
I'm also in Shenzhen.

1080
00:45:49,157 --> 00:45:50,478
You shouldn't have just finished the college entrance examination.

1081
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:51,398
To volunteer?

1082
00:45:52,517 --> 00:45:53,398
Right now,

1083
00:45:54,077 --> 00:45:55,478
As a substitute for a team.

1084
00:45:55,798 --> 00:45:56,997
As a substitute for the team.

1085
00:45:57,677 --> 00:45:59,238
Your team has mines.

1086
00:45:59,597 --> 00:46:00,838
And hired someone to replace him.

1087
00:46:04,398 --> 00:46:04,958
Correct!

1088
00:46:05,478 --> 00:46:06,517
You asked me to ask about An Lan.

1089
00:46:07,037 --> 00:46:07,958
I got some information.

1090
00:46:08,077 --> 00:46:08,798
What about

1091
00:46:09,157 --> 00:46:09,717
she

1092
00:46:09,717 --> 00:46:10,478
Are you married?

1093
00:46:13,197 --> 00:46:14,077
to feel relieved

1094
00:46:14,077 --> 00:46:14,918
I'm still single.

1095
00:46:15,597 --> 00:46:16,478
She is

1096
00:46:16,717 --> 00:46:18,557
Is the director of ES Game Operations.

1097
00:46:19,037 --> 00:46:20,037
impossible

1098
00:46:20,958 --> 00:46:22,438
It's been ten years.

1099
00:46:23,037 --> 00:46:24,318
Why is she still single?

1100
00:46:24,517 --> 00:46:25,637
For this?

1101
00:46:25,997 --> 00:46:27,557
I even called her to disturb her.

1102
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:29,557
But she is not married.

1103
00:46:29,557 --> 00:46:30,958
If she's single,

1104
00:46:31,197 --> 00:46:32,238
Then what should I do?

1105
00:46:36,517 --> 00:46:37,478
I don't know either

1106
00:46:38,557 --> 00:46:39,037
You know what?

1107
00:46:39,037 --> 00:46:40,278
I checked you long ago.

1108
00:46:40,557 --> 00:46:41,637
I checked you online.

1109
00:46:41,997 --> 00:46:44,637
I also asked someone to ask for your information in Ningjiang.

1110
00:46:45,798 --> 00:46:46,597
But I don't know why.

1111
00:46:47,478 --> 00:46:48,798
You haven't heard anything from him.

1112
00:46:51,117 --> 00:46:52,717
There's no news at all.
