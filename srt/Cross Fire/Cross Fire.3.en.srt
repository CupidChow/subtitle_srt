1
00:02:47,057 --> 00:02:48,977
Is Xiao Bei here?

2
00:02:48,977 --> 00:02:49,977
No.

3
00:02:49,977 --> 00:02:51,418
Brother, go to this side.

4
00:02:52,778 --> 00:02:54,618
I remember our mother put the cable here.

5
00:02:54,618 --> 00:02:55,778
Come this way.

6
00:02:56,858 --> 00:02:57,298
No?

7
00:02:57,298 --> 00:02:57,858
No

8
00:02:59,618 --> 00:03:01,298
The key is that we can't play the game without internet.

9
00:03:10,098 --> 00:03:11,098
Don't break it.

10
00:03:23,498 --> 00:03:24,858
Brother, I found it.

11
00:03:25,618 --> 00:03:26,138
Where?

12
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,178
Brother

13
00:03:28,298 --> 00:03:30,818
I have to take it if I find it.

14
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:32,417
Can you reach it?

15
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:33,657
Why don't you hug me?

16
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,538
You love to be brave.

17
00:03:36,538 --> 00:03:37,618
It's not enough.

18
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:44,858
Finished

19
00:03:51,938 --> 00:03:52,778
Who did this?

20
00:03:57,617 --> 00:03:58,858
If it's you,

21
00:03:58,858 --> 00:04:00,418
Our mother will nag at most.

22
00:04:00,418 --> 00:04:01,377
If it's me,

23
00:04:01,377 --> 00:04:02,338
At least a feather duster.

24
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,858
This thing has to be searched.

25
00:04:03,858 --> 00:04:05,698
We are teammates now.

26
00:04:05,698 --> 00:04:07,498
Teammates should cover for each other.

27
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:07,978
is or isn't

28
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,418
Don't be angry.

29
00:04:09,418 --> 00:04:10,578
I'll teach you a new game.

30
00:04:10,578 --> 00:04:11,338
all right?

31
00:04:16,058 --> 00:04:17,498
My cable.

32
00:04:24,978 --> 00:04:25,698
pretty

33
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:29,858
pretty

34
00:04:30,138 --> 00:04:30,698
I told you to hide.

35
00:04:31,498 --> 00:04:32,338
See where you can hide.

36
00:04:32,858 --> 00:04:33,338
pretty

37
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:36,058
brother

38
00:04:37,138 --> 00:04:38,578
What is this game called?

39
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:40,338
CROSS FIRE

40
00:04:40,338 --> 00:04:41,498
Cross Fire

41
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:42,058
Yes?

42
00:04:42,058 --> 00:04:42,617
You want to play?

43
00:04:46,138 --> 00:04:47,338
I'll set up a game account for you.

44
00:04:48,978 --> 00:04:49,617
That's enough.

45
00:04:49,617 --> 00:04:51,058
Now you have your own game account.

46
00:04:51,498 --> 00:04:52,858
But I can't play.

47
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:54,138
I'll teach you.

48
00:04:54,138 --> 00:04:54,897
Let's start the game.

49
00:04:59,658 --> 00:05:00,538
Xiaobei

50
00:05:00,978 --> 00:05:01,698
Look.

51
00:05:06,138 --> 00:05:07,858
Brother is so amazing.

52
00:05:08,138 --> 00:05:09,698
Come here, Xiao Bei.

53
00:05:09,698 --> 00:05:10,298
According to W,

54
00:05:10,658 --> 00:05:11,378
W

55
00:05:11,698 --> 00:05:12,698
Put your hands on it.

56
00:05:12,698 --> 00:05:13,538
This is going up.

57
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:15,177
It's down, S is down.

58
00:05:15,177 --> 00:05:15,858
AD is left and right.

59
00:05:18,658 --> 00:05:19,418
Stop, stop.

60
00:05:19,698 --> 00:05:21,098
If you run into the front again,

61
00:05:21,098 --> 00:05:22,298
You jump up according to the space.

62
00:05:22,578 --> 00:05:23,017
I'll catch up with you.

63
00:05:27,298 --> 00:05:28,897
Brother, why can't I jump on it?

64
00:05:28,897 --> 00:05:30,578
Is this computer broken?

65
00:05:30,858 --> 00:05:31,858
Squat down first.

66
00:05:31,858 --> 00:05:32,737
Then I counted 3 2 1.

67
00:05:32,737 --> 00:05:33,298
You jump again.

68
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:33,578
good

69
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:35,818
three

70
00:05:36,698 --> 00:05:37,298
two

71
00:05:38,298 --> 00:05:38,698
one

72
00:05:39,457 --> 00:05:39,858
jump

73
00:05:56,818 --> 00:05:57,578
Are you happy, boy?

74
00:05:57,578 --> 00:05:58,578
Shuang

75
00:05:58,578 --> 00:05:58,897
Brother

76
00:05:58,897 --> 00:06:00,578
This game is so fun.

77
00:06:01,258 --> 00:06:01,698
Is it fun?

78
00:06:02,858 --> 00:06:03,138
Brother

79
00:06:03,138 --> 00:06:03,818
I'm telling you.

80
00:06:03,818 --> 00:06:06,258
This game is not fun in general.

81
00:06:06,258 --> 00:06:07,578
It's really fun.

82
00:06:07,858 --> 00:06:10,418
If you move the mouse to the left, you are cutting the left perspective.

83
00:06:10,418 --> 00:06:11,858
If you move to the right, you're looking at the right side.

84
00:06:13,578 --> 00:06:15,298
Brother is so handsome.

85
00:06:15,298 --> 00:06:15,978
I want to come.

86
00:06:16,658 --> 00:06:17,098
Open it.

87
00:06:19,897 --> 00:06:20,138
come

88
00:06:20,378 --> 00:06:21,138
Does it hurt?

89
00:06:21,457 --> 00:06:22,017
I'll help you up.

90
00:06:22,378 --> 00:06:23,017
Did you fall on your butt?

91
00:06:24,298 --> 00:06:24,978
Brother

92
00:06:24,978 --> 00:06:26,138
What's going on?

93
00:06:26,138 --> 00:06:27,698
The way you held the gun was wrong.

94
00:06:28,298 --> 00:06:29,858
Take this pistol first.

95
00:06:29,858 --> 00:06:31,138
On your shoulders.

96
00:06:31,737 --> 00:06:32,658
This is the gap.

97
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:33,737
Collimating target

98
00:06:33,737 --> 00:06:34,578
Three points and one line.

99
00:06:34,578 --> 00:06:34,858
Okay?

100
00:06:35,138 --> 00:06:35,578
good

101
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:36,457
Aim!

102
00:06:36,978 --> 00:06:37,818
Here, let me hold you.

103
00:06:37,818 --> 00:06:38,177
Stand still.

104
00:06:38,578 --> 00:06:39,258
Aim first.

105
00:06:39,258 --> 00:06:40,298
See that bottle?

106
00:06:40,418 --> 00:06:40,978
I see it.

107
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:41,538
Aim for it.

108
00:06:45,737 --> 00:06:46,418
One more shot.

109
00:06:49,138 --> 00:06:50,177
I'm not helping you anymore.

110
00:06:51,138 --> 00:06:51,858
Aim

111
00:06:51,858 --> 00:06:52,737
Calm down.

112
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:53,298
three

113
00:06:53,578 --> 00:06:53,978
two

114
00:06:54,538 --> 00:06:54,737
one

115
00:06:57,298 --> 00:06:58,698
pretty

116
00:06:58,698 --> 00:06:59,258
I'm hit.

117
00:06:59,258 --> 00:06:59,978
Fierce

118
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,858
You're really talented.

119
00:07:02,658 --> 00:07:03,658
How about this? Do you want another round?

120
00:07:04,418 --> 00:07:05,018
think

121
00:07:05,018 --> 00:07:06,458
But what about your homework?

122
00:07:11,218 --> 00:07:12,218
If you have the final exam,

123
00:07:12,218 --> 00:07:13,338
Can give me the top ten.

124
00:07:13,898 --> 00:07:14,898
I'll teach you how to play.

125
00:07:14,898 --> 00:07:15,538
Alright?

126
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:16,658
pinky swear

127
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,658
You can't change for 100 years.

128
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:20,978
Seal

129
00:07:24,658 --> 00:07:25,577
I'm out of bullets.

130
00:07:25,577 --> 00:07:26,098
I'll give you the bullet.

131
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:26,458
hurry up

132
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:27,098
I'll cover you.

133
00:07:27,858 --> 00:07:28,577
Where are you going?

134
00:07:29,978 --> 00:07:30,458
Run.

135
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,218
I'll cover you.

136
00:07:34,338 --> 00:07:34,778
Run.

137
00:07:34,778 --> 00:07:35,338
I dare you to come here.

138
00:07:36,658 --> 00:07:37,338
Where are you going?

139
00:07:40,018 --> 00:07:40,617
Don't run.

140
00:07:41,697 --> 00:07:42,538
Don't move.

141
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:43,338
Put your hands up.

142
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,018
Don't move.

143
00:07:46,177 --> 00:07:46,778
Don't move.

144
00:07:51,658 --> 00:07:52,538
That's enough.

145
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,338
Are you acting like a father?

146
00:07:54,338 --> 00:07:55,218
Having dinner

147
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:56,658
Yes, sir.

148
00:07:57,338 --> 00:07:58,218
Okay, clean the battlefield.

149
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,218
Are you ready to eat?

150
00:07:59,218 --> 00:07:59,978
Come on, pack up.

151
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:01,898
Let's play another round.

152
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,098
What do you want to play?

153
00:08:03,098 --> 00:08:03,577
I'm telling you,

154
00:08:03,577 --> 00:08:04,218
This is a game.

155
00:08:04,577 --> 00:08:05,098
Take a look.

156
00:08:05,577 --> 00:08:06,338
Your mom has to scold me.

157
00:08:06,338 --> 00:08:06,858
Do you know

158
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,577
You should eat well.

159
00:08:09,577 --> 00:08:10,338
If you do that,

160
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:12,778
To be as tall as your brother.

161
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,658
Long and long.

162
00:08:16,018 --> 00:08:17,458
I want to be taller than my brother.

163
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:17,978
Alright, alright.

164
00:08:17,978 --> 00:08:18,978
You must be taller than your brother.

165
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,098
The weather is good today.

166
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:21,338
Let's eat on the balcony.

167
00:08:21,338 --> 00:08:22,458
good

168
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:23,658
Remember to wash your hands.

169
00:08:23,658 --> 00:08:24,658
Come on, wash your hands.

170
00:08:24,658 --> 00:08:25,098
eat

171
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:43,898
What happened last night?

172
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,418
Why does the light bulb keep flashing?

173
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:48,218
Maybe it's the circuit.

174
00:08:48,658 --> 00:08:49,858
In the property management group this morning,

175
00:08:49,858 --> 00:08:51,418
Many owners are complaining.

176
00:08:51,418 --> 00:08:52,298
Later, the property management said

177
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,218
A lot of communities have such a situation.

178
00:08:54,218 --> 00:08:57,338
To detect the existence of mirror parallel universe.

179
00:08:57,338 --> 00:09:00,098
To solve the problem of neutron decay

180
00:09:00,098 --> 00:09:02,538
Has existed for 40 years.

181
00:09:03,218 --> 00:09:05,458
Between the neighboring worlds,

182
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,978
The subtle repulsive power.

183
00:09:06,978 --> 00:09:07,898
They interact with each other constantly.

184
00:09:07,898 --> 00:09:08,778
son

185
00:09:08,778 --> 00:09:09,458
Wake up.

186
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,978
Interact with each other.

187
00:09:10,978 --> 00:09:13,338
Rather than evolution and development.

188
00:09:26,538 --> 00:09:28,898
I can't do it anyway.

189
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:37,697
Hello, mom.

190
00:09:37,697 --> 00:09:38,538
Xiaofeng

191
00:09:38,538 --> 00:09:39,778
Did you report to work?

192
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:41,098
Right away.

193
00:09:41,098 --> 00:09:41,898
I'll be out soon.

194
00:09:41,898 --> 00:09:42,697
What time is it?

195
00:09:42,697 --> 00:09:43,697
Don't be late.

196
00:09:43,697 --> 00:09:45,218
Your father worked so hard

197
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,418
The job I got for you.

198
00:09:47,418 --> 00:09:48,098
Also

199
00:09:48,098 --> 00:09:49,658
Don't forget your portfolio.

200
00:09:49,658 --> 00:09:50,538
Alright. Got it.

201
00:10:01,218 --> 00:10:01,658
Good leader.

202
00:10:03,218 --> 00:10:03,778
Good leader.

203
00:10:08,577 --> 00:10:09,098
Good leader.

204
00:10:10,658 --> 00:10:11,218
Good leader.

205
00:10:37,538 --> 00:10:39,697
Everyone is so busy.

206
00:10:40,218 --> 00:10:41,098
Hello, Director.

207
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,018
The director is here.

208
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:43,098
Alright.

209
00:10:43,098 --> 00:10:44,018
It's hard.

210
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:44,937
Everyone has worked hard.

211
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:45,577
today

212
00:10:45,577 --> 00:10:47,538
To introduce a new colleague.

213
00:10:48,697 --> 00:10:49,338
Xiao Xiao.

214
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:51,898
Xiao Xiao.

215
00:10:53,018 --> 00:10:53,577
Come on.

216
00:10:56,338 --> 00:10:57,898
This is Xiao Feng.

217
00:10:57,898 --> 00:10:59,458
The new comrade of our Integrated Office

218
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,018
Welcome.

219
00:11:01,137 --> 00:11:01,658
well

220
00:11:01,658 --> 00:11:02,737
Welcome

221
00:11:03,218 --> 00:11:03,778
Come on.

222
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:04,898
Xiao, this way.

223
00:11:07,218 --> 00:11:08,458
Xiao, look.

224
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:11,218
You can choose any table or chair here.

225
00:11:11,218 --> 00:11:12,778
You must choose one you like.

226
00:11:14,098 --> 00:11:15,018
Choose.

227
00:11:15,018 --> 00:11:15,658
Choose them.

228
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:16,018
That's right.

229
00:11:16,498 --> 00:11:18,298
You must be responsible.

230
00:11:18,298 --> 00:11:19,138
Help Xiao.

231
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:20,498
Choose the right desk.

232
00:11:20,498 --> 00:11:22,418
Let's give him the first pass.

233
00:11:22,418 --> 00:11:23,138
Alright.

234
00:11:23,138 --> 00:11:24,418
It's all on us.

235
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:24,817
Come on.

236
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:25,538
Take a look for yourself.

237
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:26,778
Beautiful and graceful.

238
00:11:26,778 --> 00:11:28,177
The key is to fit you.

239
00:11:29,138 --> 00:11:29,898
Director

240
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:31,658
Don't bother.

241
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,538
I'll just pick one myself.

242
00:11:33,538 --> 00:11:34,298
Whatever you want.

243
00:11:35,298 --> 00:11:36,937
How can this be casual?

244
00:11:36,937 --> 00:11:37,817
I'm telling you,

245
00:11:37,817 --> 00:11:39,138
Choose your office.

246
00:11:39,138 --> 00:11:41,018
Is more important than the choice of the object.

247
00:11:41,018 --> 00:11:41,538
Think about it.

248
00:11:41,538 --> 00:11:43,298
You have to deal with it for the rest of your life.

249
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:44,937
But you can't be so careless.

250
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:45,937
Come on.

251
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:47,177
This is good.

252
00:11:47,177 --> 00:11:48,018
This is perfect.

253
00:11:48,817 --> 00:11:49,418
to take a look at

254
00:11:49,898 --> 00:11:50,898
This one looks good.

255
00:11:50,898 --> 00:11:51,778
Cypress

256
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,538
It's really strong.

257
00:11:54,538 --> 00:11:55,778
The durability of cypress wood.

258
00:11:56,778 --> 00:11:58,138
This is reliable.

259
00:11:58,658 --> 00:11:59,618
Why don't you choose this one?

260
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:00,778
I believe in Miss Wang.

261
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:01,898
It can last forever.

262
00:12:02,418 --> 00:12:03,418
This is really good. Look.

263
00:12:09,538 --> 00:12:10,658
What happened

264
00:12:10,658 --> 00:12:12,778
Director, what's going on?

265
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:13,378
Xiao Xiao.

266
00:12:13,778 --> 00:12:15,418
It's time for lunch. Come on.

267
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:22,138
It will become a single bed.

268
00:12:25,658 --> 00:12:27,298
It's comfortable to sleep.

269
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:31,418
Typing is not urgent.

270
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,418
Only those who rest can work.

271
00:12:33,418 --> 00:12:34,018
Sleep well.

272
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:34,898
In the afternoon,

273
00:12:37,538 --> 00:12:38,298
and

274
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,538
Don't work when everyone is resting.

275
00:12:40,538 --> 00:12:42,018
Will cause trouble.

276
00:12:42,898 --> 00:12:43,538
Go to sleep.

277
00:12:46,018 --> 00:12:46,898
Alright.

278
00:12:46,898 --> 00:12:48,298
Everyone has worked hard.

279
00:12:49,898 --> 00:12:50,418
Good afternoon!

280
00:13:29,138 --> 00:13:30,057
Is this yours?

281
00:14:03,898 --> 00:14:04,658
Have you seen my shoes?

282
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:06,898
Above ground

283
00:14:09,898 --> 00:14:10,658
Where is it?

284
00:14:14,298 --> 00:14:15,498
I put it here just now.

285
00:14:20,418 --> 00:14:21,817
No, who told you to touch my stuff?

286
00:14:22,057 --> 00:14:23,898
Put your shoes on my desk.

287
00:14:24,378 --> 00:14:25,057
what?

288
00:14:25,538 --> 00:14:26,057
As an offering.

289
00:14:28,658 --> 00:14:29,937
Get my shoes back now.

290
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:30,418
otherwise

291
00:14:30,418 --> 00:14:31,658
I'll give your phone to Director Zheng.

292
00:14:31,658 --> 00:14:32,298
Alright.

293
00:14:32,697 --> 00:14:34,177
I'll report you for cheating.

294
00:14:34,177 --> 00:14:35,057
Sleep in class.

295
00:14:35,057 --> 00:14:36,298
And discriminates against disabled students.

296
00:14:37,018 --> 00:14:38,778
Are you looking for shoes?

297
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:40,138
I just saw it was broken.

298
00:14:40,138 --> 00:14:41,538
I thought it was garbage.

299
00:14:41,538 --> 00:14:42,538
So I threw it away.

300
00:14:42,538 --> 00:14:43,298
Where did you throw it?

301
00:14:43,298 --> 00:14:44,778
In the middle of the garbage can on the first floor.

302
00:15:07,298 --> 00:15:08,538
Please tell me.

303
00:15:08,538 --> 00:15:09,018
This time,

304
00:15:09,298 --> 00:15:11,538
It's our choice for the track and field team.

305
00:15:11,898 --> 00:15:13,138
So I hope everyone

306
00:15:13,138 --> 00:15:14,817
Can give full play to their capabilities.

307
00:15:15,138 --> 00:15:15,738
Go to all lengths

308
00:15:15,738 --> 00:15:16,298
all right?

309
00:15:16,298 --> 00:15:16,937
good

310
00:15:16,937 --> 00:15:17,898
Get ready.

311
00:15:28,538 --> 00:15:29,418
Chu song

312
00:15:29,618 --> 00:15:30,418
how could that be?

313
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:32,498
The shoes are broken.

314
00:15:32,658 --> 00:15:33,138
Go back.

315
00:15:33,418 --> 00:15:34,177
Go back.

316
00:15:34,658 --> 00:15:35,817
My shoes are broken.

317
00:15:35,817 --> 00:15:37,138
Do you have a backup?

318
00:15:37,538 --> 00:15:38,658
Let me change my sneakers.

319
00:15:38,658 --> 00:15:39,138
a row

320
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,018
Hurry. Go back.

321
00:15:40,018 --> 00:15:41,018
Teacher,

322
00:15:41,018 --> 00:15:42,738
When can we start?

323
00:15:42,738 --> 00:15:43,658
That's right.

324
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:45,977
Chu song

325
00:15:46,298 --> 00:15:47,738
Why don't you join the competition next time?

326
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,018
Namely

327
00:15:49,018 --> 00:15:50,898
Don't waste your precious time.

328
00:15:50,898 --> 00:15:52,418
Sir, let's get started.

329
00:15:53,378 --> 00:15:54,177
Get ready.

330
00:16:22,418 --> 00:16:23,298
Get set

331
00:17:12,258 --> 00:17:13,538
I can beat you with my bare feet.

332
00:17:13,538 --> 00:17:14,057
Refuse to accept

333
00:17:14,057 --> 00:17:14,618
One more round.

334
00:17:18,817 --> 00:17:19,538
Congratulations.

335
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,538
Barefoot Immortal.

336
00:17:21,057 --> 00:17:22,817
You're stepping on the Hot Wheels.

337
00:17:24,018 --> 00:17:25,778
Why don't I lend you my shoes?

338
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:26,418
Anyway, I don't need it.

339
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:27,898
Go away

340
00:18:47,177 --> 00:18:47,898
You're back.

341
00:18:47,898 --> 00:18:48,778
Hurry and eat.

342
00:18:49,418 --> 00:18:49,898
chopsticks

343
00:18:53,057 --> 00:18:53,778
Where are your shoes?

344
00:18:54,618 --> 00:18:55,498
I lost it.

345
00:18:55,898 --> 00:18:57,177
How can I lose my shoes?

346
00:18:59,618 --> 00:19:01,378
Did you make trouble at school again?

347
00:19:01,538 --> 00:19:02,538
Where are the chopsticks?

348
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,697
The sports meeting next month.

349
00:19:13,697 --> 00:19:14,457
My running shoes are broken.

350
00:19:18,498 --> 00:19:20,018
The sports meeting next month.

351
00:19:20,018 --> 00:19:20,977
My running shoes are broken.

352
00:19:25,057 --> 00:19:26,057
My running shoes are broken.

353
00:19:27,057 --> 00:19:27,738
What?

354
00:19:28,378 --> 00:19:29,177
It can't be fixed.

355
00:19:29,177 --> 00:19:29,937
It can't be fixed.

356
00:19:30,618 --> 00:19:31,778
And the nail is bald.

357
00:19:31,778 --> 00:19:32,817
It's only been a few months.

358
00:19:33,898 --> 00:19:35,177
Do you practice sprinting or eating shoes?

359
00:19:39,498 --> 00:19:40,418
That's it.

360
00:20:08,097 --> 00:20:08,538
Xiao Xiao.

361
00:20:10,538 --> 00:20:11,377
You can do that.

362
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:14,218
Did you practice the piano when you were young?

363
00:20:14,218 --> 00:20:16,498
Your typing speed is fast.

364
00:20:16,498 --> 00:20:17,097
personnel

365
00:20:17,857 --> 00:20:18,698
No, thank you.

366
00:20:18,698 --> 00:20:19,778
Thank you, Director.

367
00:20:19,778 --> 00:20:21,617
I usually touch the keyboard a lot.

368
00:20:21,617 --> 00:20:22,538
I'm familiar with them.

369
00:20:22,538 --> 00:20:23,057
I'm telling you,

370
00:20:23,057 --> 00:20:24,738
I'll take good care of you.

371
00:20:24,738 --> 00:20:25,258
Come on.

372
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:26,498
I have an important task for you.

373
00:20:26,978 --> 00:20:28,337
Next month,

374
00:20:28,337 --> 00:20:30,298
Our union will hold an event.

375
00:20:30,298 --> 00:20:32,057
I ordered a batch of those bunting.

376
00:20:32,057 --> 00:20:33,817
Check if they're ready.

377
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,218
Especially that color.

378
00:20:35,218 --> 00:20:36,577
I ordered the red one.

379
00:20:36,577 --> 00:20:37,298
Don't be partial.

380
00:20:37,298 --> 00:20:39,097
The red one is very bright.

381
00:20:39,097 --> 00:20:40,538
How do you like my taste?

382
00:20:41,337 --> 00:20:42,057
I must.

383
00:20:42,577 --> 00:20:43,298
I'll be right there.

384
00:20:43,298 --> 00:20:44,218
Hurry up.

385
00:20:45,018 --> 00:20:45,617
This order

386
00:20:45,938 --> 00:20:46,978
Please hurry up.

387
00:20:47,377 --> 00:20:48,258
Okay, hold on.

388
00:20:48,258 --> 00:20:49,258
Thank you

389
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,018
Boss

390
00:21:32,538 --> 00:21:33,577
A bowl of instant noodles.

391
00:21:33,577 --> 00:21:34,337
A bottle of drink.

392
00:21:34,337 --> 00:21:35,458
Two ham sausages.

393
00:21:36,218 --> 00:21:36,698
eighteen

394
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,178
To the man with the paper on the headset.

395
00:21:42,778 --> 00:21:43,577
You want to tell him who bought it?

396
00:21:43,817 --> 00:21:44,377
No need

397
00:21:47,377 --> 00:21:48,018
Someone gave it to you.

398
00:22:05,178 --> 00:22:05,857
to take away

399
00:22:06,097 --> 00:22:07,738
If you don't eat, you will starve to death.

400
00:22:07,738 --> 00:22:09,018
I don't want food even if I starve to death.

401
00:22:10,617 --> 00:22:12,218
It's okay if you don't eat.

402
00:22:12,218 --> 00:22:13,458
But you paid the rent.

403
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,337
You should go back.

404
00:22:14,337 --> 00:22:15,778
Otherwise, you will waste too much.

405
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:17,857
I haven't planned to go back since I moved out.

406
00:22:21,698 --> 00:22:23,057
You said that.

407
00:22:23,057 --> 00:22:23,817
I'll rent it out.

408
00:22:24,498 --> 00:22:25,298
casual

409
00:22:29,857 --> 00:22:30,538
Lieutenant

410
00:22:30,538 --> 00:22:32,377
Can you be realistic?

411
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:34,538
Do something serious.

412
00:22:35,258 --> 00:22:36,778
Don't waste time here.

413
00:22:36,778 --> 00:22:37,458
Look at me.

414
00:22:39,298 --> 00:22:41,298
With a job and a future,

415
00:22:41,298 --> 00:22:42,978
The leader values me very much.

416
00:22:42,978 --> 00:22:43,778
Look.

417
00:22:44,298 --> 00:22:45,258
And gave me a big project.

418
00:22:45,258 --> 00:22:46,018
I'm looking for you.

419
00:22:46,377 --> 00:22:47,538
One hundred flags. Come here.

420
00:22:49,097 --> 00:22:49,857
Come on.

421
00:22:50,218 --> 00:22:51,337
Little by little.

422
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:51,738
Come on.

423
00:22:51,978 --> 00:22:52,298
Order a little.

424
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,778
Fifteen.

425
00:22:56,978 --> 00:22:57,498
twenty

426
00:22:58,738 --> 00:23:00,738
Look, the quality of this flag is very good.

427
00:23:00,738 --> 00:23:01,458
fifty

428
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:08,778
It's a big project.

429
00:23:11,778 --> 00:23:13,978
You're amazing.

430
00:23:13,978 --> 00:23:15,498
amazing

431
00:23:16,617 --> 00:23:18,258
amazing

432
00:23:20,178 --> 00:23:21,097
Big project.

433
00:23:22,738 --> 00:23:23,857
Look at this flag.

434
00:23:23,857 --> 00:23:25,258
The quality is so good.

435
00:23:25,258 --> 00:23:26,498
I will starve you to death.

436
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,498
Come on.

437
00:23:28,738 --> 00:23:29,218
Stay a bit!

438
00:23:34,258 --> 00:23:35,377
Why is my closet open?

439
00:23:35,377 --> 00:23:36,538
Where's my bag?

440
00:23:37,097 --> 00:23:38,298
Mine is gone too.

441
00:23:38,298 --> 00:23:39,538
It's in there.

442
00:23:47,978 --> 00:23:48,778
Chu song

443
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,218
Did I send it to the wrong location?

444
00:24:20,218 --> 00:24:21,258
What time is it?

445
00:24:21,258 --> 00:24:22,097
No one came.

446
00:24:23,698 --> 00:24:24,498
Don't worry!

447
00:24:24,498 --> 00:24:25,458
The time will come.

448
00:24:34,298 --> 00:24:35,538
Where's Reborn?

449
00:24:35,538 --> 00:24:37,018
They said their team wouldn't let go.

450
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:38,498
What a good sniper rifle.

451
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:40,377
Their team will be in the same division as us.

452
00:24:40,377 --> 00:24:41,097
Great.

453
00:24:41,097 --> 00:24:42,298
A teammate becomes an opponent.

454
00:24:43,978 --> 00:24:44,778
In 2049,

455
00:24:44,778 --> 00:24:45,778
My family has arranged a job for me.

456
00:24:47,258 --> 00:24:48,258
I'm not coming.

457
00:24:48,258 --> 00:24:49,938
How could our team?

458
00:24:50,538 --> 00:24:52,298
Then I'll contact 2049.

459
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:53,698
We can wait two more days for him.

460
00:24:58,498 --> 00:24:59,498
perfect

461
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,178
You have a reason to stop coming.

462
00:25:01,538 --> 00:25:02,778
What if she doesn't come?

463
00:25:02,778 --> 00:25:03,698
You're not working?

464
00:25:03,698 --> 00:25:04,698
Let's go home.

465
00:25:04,698 --> 00:25:06,178
Boss will pay the bill.

466
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:06,978
to wait a moment

467
00:25:07,498 --> 00:25:08,498
I have an appointment with someone.

468
00:25:08,738 --> 00:25:09,698
You have an appointment with someone.

469
00:25:10,097 --> 00:25:11,377
I remember now.

470
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:13,178
You are allergic to cats.

471
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,377
Why did you invite people here?

472
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,178
I didn't ask for this place.

473
00:25:19,538 --> 00:25:20,218
She asked me out.

474
00:25:24,258 --> 00:25:25,258
She's so pretty.

475
00:25:25,258 --> 00:25:26,538
You didn't introduce him to me.

476
00:25:26,778 --> 00:25:28,218
Are you still my brother?

477
00:25:30,298 --> 00:25:30,738
He's here.

478
00:26:03,018 --> 00:26:04,057
Pandora

479
00:26:09,817 --> 00:26:10,738
Lu Xiao Bei,

480
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:12,738
Hello

481
00:26:15,298 --> 00:26:16,857
I said the taxi of Ning Jiang

482
00:26:16,857 --> 00:26:17,617
It's too cruel.

483
00:26:18,738 --> 00:26:19,978
A few kilometers of road,

484
00:26:21,218 --> 00:26:23,097
I can't spend so much on a taxi.

485
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:28,018
ticket

486
00:26:30,018 --> 00:26:30,377
Reimbursement

487
00:26:32,698 --> 00:26:32,978
Beauty

488
00:26:33,778 --> 00:26:34,538
What do you call it?

489
00:26:35,938 --> 00:26:38,018
S + 1 Su Jiayi

490
00:26:38,018 --> 00:26:39,377
The master I hired

491
00:26:41,018 --> 00:26:41,938
Killer

492
00:26:42,258 --> 00:26:43,458
Hello, Su Jiayi.

493
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:45,097
My name is Cheng Hao. I'm from...

494
00:26:45,097 --> 00:26:46,097
Waiter/Waitress

495
00:26:50,978 --> 00:26:51,698
Hello, have a look.

496
00:26:52,617 --> 00:26:53,018
Take a look.

497
00:26:53,377 --> 00:26:55,258
What will you order?

498
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:56,817
What?

499
00:26:57,698 --> 00:26:58,377
What?

500
00:26:59,538 --> 00:27:00,538
This is already

501
00:27:00,538 --> 00:27:02,258
The best coffee shop in Ningjiang.

502
00:27:02,698 --> 00:27:04,538
There are hands to make coffee. Look.

503
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:07,218
What is there to drink?

504
00:27:07,218 --> 00:27:08,218
No matter how hard you are, you're full.

505
00:27:09,018 --> 00:27:10,178
Is there egg fried rice?

506
00:27:10,698 --> 00:27:12,218
Sorry there is no egg fried rice here

507
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:17,538
This is the most important e-sports town in East China.

508
00:27:18,498 --> 00:27:19,978
a book is not judged by its cover

509
00:27:19,978 --> 00:27:21,698
There are bad clothes everywhere.

510
00:27:21,698 --> 00:27:22,617
I can't understand.

511
00:27:23,218 --> 00:27:23,938
And this one.

512
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:25,178
My name is Cheng Hao.

513
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:26,178
It's not important.

514
00:27:28,178 --> 00:27:28,817
Where is the master?

515
00:27:30,258 --> 00:27:31,298
Something went wrong.

516
00:27:31,498 --> 00:27:32,258
Where are the people?

517
00:27:32,258 --> 00:27:33,978
Less than we expected.

518
00:27:33,978 --> 00:27:34,978
Just tell me

519
00:27:34,978 --> 00:27:36,577
Except us,

520
00:27:36,577 --> 00:27:37,337
Who else is there?

521
00:27:40,857 --> 00:27:41,498
Shake hands.

522
00:27:43,258 --> 00:27:44,698
I'm Cheng Hao.

523
00:27:44,698 --> 00:27:45,738
Ning Jiang, Song Zhongji.

524
00:27:46,617 --> 00:27:47,298
Lu Xiao Bei,

525
00:27:47,538 --> 00:27:49,097
We agreed to combine the strong and the strong.

526
00:27:49,097 --> 00:27:50,218
It's a big deal.

527
00:27:50,498 --> 00:27:51,298
There's a sponsor.

528
00:27:51,298 --> 00:27:51,978
You have a master.

529
00:27:51,978 --> 00:27:52,817
What about the sponsorship?

530
00:27:52,817 --> 00:27:53,617
Where is the master?

531
00:27:54,857 --> 00:27:55,817
The sponsorship fee means

532
00:27:55,817 --> 00:27:57,857
Others need to pay for joining our team.

533
00:27:57,857 --> 00:27:58,538
Understand?

534
00:28:01,857 --> 00:28:04,577
You came all the way here to play with me.

535
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:06,218
There are a few people.

536
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:07,258
But at least we can

537
00:28:07,258 --> 00:28:08,458
To be the main force.

538
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:09,817
You don't have to pay for it.

539
00:28:10,298 --> 00:28:11,377
Let's figure out a way.

540
00:28:11,577 --> 00:28:12,377
You're here.

541
00:28:13,218 --> 00:28:14,018
Give it a try.

542
00:28:17,018 --> 00:28:17,938
You know I'm...

543
00:28:17,938 --> 00:28:20,377
A big V with 100,000 followers on Weibo?

544
00:28:21,377 --> 00:28:22,218
celebrity microblogger

545
00:28:22,218 --> 00:28:24,498
I'll lose my fans if I stay with you.

546
00:28:24,498 --> 00:28:25,698
The round trip fare.

547
00:28:25,698 --> 00:28:26,857
To me on WeChat.

548
00:28:26,857 --> 00:28:28,458
Then I'll make you black.

549
00:28:30,698 --> 00:28:31,377
S+1

550
00:28:34,018 --> 00:28:35,258
My mother, this big sister,

551
00:28:35,258 --> 00:28:36,698
What a wild way!

552
00:28:37,538 --> 00:28:38,617
Have you heard of the Blue Fish Team?

553
00:28:39,817 --> 00:28:40,857
The only semi-professional player

554
00:28:40,857 --> 00:28:41,978
All Women Team.

555
00:28:41,978 --> 00:28:42,978
Su Jiayi is the captain.

556
00:28:42,978 --> 00:28:44,458
The first female gunman in Shanghai.

557
00:28:47,018 --> 00:28:49,178
Then the team broke up because of bad results.

558
00:28:49,538 --> 00:28:51,178
The players went to school.

559
00:28:51,178 --> 00:28:52,018
Get married.

560
00:28:52,778 --> 00:28:53,857
She's the only one

561
00:28:54,258 --> 00:28:55,057
You're still professional.

562
00:28:55,298 --> 00:28:56,218
She's a master?

563
00:28:56,218 --> 00:28:57,097
Call her back.

564
00:28:57,097 --> 00:28:58,377
No need

565
00:28:58,377 --> 00:28:59,698
You can't call him back.

566
00:28:59,978 --> 00:29:01,097
unless

567
00:29:01,097 --> 00:29:02,097
She wanted to come back.

568
00:29:02,577 --> 00:29:03,617
What do you mean?

569
00:29:04,018 --> 00:29:05,018
With her mouth,

570
00:29:05,018 --> 00:29:06,738
All the ten people in the circle have offended nine and a half.

571
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:08,617
She can't live any longer.

572
00:29:08,617 --> 00:29:10,698
If she still wants to be a professional,

573
00:29:10,698 --> 00:29:11,978
Here

574
00:29:11,978 --> 00:29:12,978
Is her last choice.

575
00:29:13,698 --> 00:29:14,458
He's here.

576
00:29:21,178 --> 00:29:22,298
I have good news for you.

577
00:29:23,258 --> 00:29:24,698
Half a minute ago,

578
00:29:24,698 --> 00:29:25,978
I decided to stay here.

579
00:29:26,337 --> 00:29:27,817
The condition is worse.

580
00:29:29,298 --> 00:29:31,738
The environment is bad.

581
00:29:31,738 --> 00:29:33,018
But think about it.

582
00:29:33,018 --> 00:29:35,538
A few months later, the top story in esports circles

583
00:29:35,538 --> 00:29:37,018
Through the fire goddess Su Jiayi.

584
00:29:37,018 --> 00:29:38,298
To lead the third-rate team.

585
00:29:38,738 --> 00:29:40,377
Into the top professional league.

586
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:41,778
The design is wonderful.

587
00:29:41,778 --> 00:29:42,978
The story is inspiring.

588
00:29:42,978 --> 00:29:44,817
By then, my fans on Weibo

589
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:46,978
To one million yuan.

590
00:29:49,218 --> 00:29:50,458
You all have my light.

591
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:00,097
Hello, everyone.

592
00:30:00,097 --> 00:30:02,738
Today, Su Jiayi came to Ningjiang.

593
00:30:02,978 --> 00:30:04,218
Today is Pandora.

594
00:30:04,377 --> 00:30:05,738
By the way, I'd like to introduce

595
00:30:05,738 --> 00:30:07,337
My Ning Jiang's younger brother, Habi,

596
00:30:07,577 --> 00:30:08,298
Hapi

597
00:30:08,298 --> 00:30:09,298
Say hello to everyone.

598
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:12,018
Follow me, Su Jiayi. Tonight,

599
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,298
To see Su Jiayi and Hobby.

600
00:30:28,097 --> 00:30:29,817
The two-bedroom house is mine.

601
00:30:30,218 --> 00:30:30,738
I can live here.

602
00:30:31,097 --> 00:30:31,978
Can also rub the computer.

603
00:30:31,978 --> 00:30:32,617
Play games.

604
00:30:32,617 --> 00:30:33,337
My mother.

605
00:30:33,337 --> 00:30:35,097
Is it a place where people live?

606
00:30:35,337 --> 00:30:38,097
You've been saving takeouts for years.

607
00:30:39,577 --> 00:30:41,218
Aunt Bao has something at home.

608
00:30:41,218 --> 00:30:42,178
You didn't come to clean it.

609
00:30:42,178 --> 00:30:44,337
It's not like two days.

610
00:30:44,337 --> 00:30:45,218
Like two years.

611
00:30:49,258 --> 00:30:51,218
Your TV looks good.

612
00:30:51,218 --> 00:30:51,978
Why are you shooting it?

613
00:30:52,258 --> 00:30:53,778
Xiaokang, give her some color.

614
00:30:53,778 --> 00:30:54,978
Master, I'm here.

615
00:30:56,178 --> 00:30:57,057
How does it look?

616
00:30:57,778 --> 00:30:58,978
Konka TV is very high-tech.

617
00:30:59,978 --> 00:31:01,178
Artificial intelligence, have you heard of it?

618
00:31:01,577 --> 00:31:03,097
I can't live here.

619
00:31:03,097 --> 00:31:04,218
There are cockroaches.

620
00:31:04,218 --> 00:31:05,458
I'm most afraid of cockroaches.

621
00:31:06,817 --> 00:31:07,377
So,

622
00:31:10,178 --> 00:31:11,538
therefore

623
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:13,458
Su Jiayi, goddess of e-sports,

624
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:16,298
In such a bad environment.

625
00:31:16,298 --> 00:31:17,298
I like the setting.

626
00:31:29,698 --> 00:31:31,698
You still use Derricks?

627
00:31:32,097 --> 00:31:32,938
A little tasteful.

628
00:31:36,218 --> 00:31:37,018
Get up.

629
00:31:37,218 --> 00:31:37,738
This is mine

630
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:39,057
Lu Xiao Bei,

631
00:31:39,337 --> 00:31:40,577
I'll live here from now on.

632
00:31:40,938 --> 00:31:41,458
what

633
00:31:41,938 --> 00:31:42,698
I live in this room.

634
00:31:43,298 --> 00:31:44,018
Give it to me.

635
00:31:45,377 --> 00:31:45,978
You live in this room.

636
00:31:45,978 --> 00:31:46,778
Where will I live?

637
00:31:46,778 --> 00:31:48,778
Didn't your team handle the accommodation?

638
00:31:49,778 --> 00:31:50,458
I'll give it to you.

639
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:51,178
I live on the street.

640
00:31:52,538 --> 00:31:53,577
Isn't there a room?

641
00:31:54,018 --> 00:31:54,577
The house

642
00:31:56,218 --> 00:31:57,178
This room

643
00:31:57,698 --> 00:31:59,698
This is a utility room, this is for storage.

644
00:31:59,857 --> 00:32:00,938
I live here.

645
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:02,538
I'll let you go.

646
00:32:06,817 --> 00:32:07,577
Xiaobei

647
00:32:07,577 --> 00:32:08,978
Aren't you bullying an honest man?

648
00:32:09,738 --> 00:32:10,778
What can we do?

649
00:32:10,778 --> 00:32:12,258
Let her stay in a hotel if she can't.

650
00:32:12,258 --> 00:32:13,018
What about the money?

651
00:32:16,298 --> 00:32:17,738
I'll give you half an hour to pack up.

652
00:32:17,738 --> 00:32:18,538
I'm tired.

653
00:32:18,538 --> 00:32:19,458
I want to sleep later.

654
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:20,218
Move out of my way

655
00:32:25,698 --> 00:32:27,458
Is there something wrong with your door?

656
00:32:29,617 --> 00:32:30,817
Sister, sorry.

657
00:32:30,817 --> 00:32:31,938
In this room,

658
00:32:31,938 --> 00:32:33,218
Except for you.

659
00:32:36,178 --> 00:32:36,938
Tell you what,

660
00:32:36,938 --> 00:32:38,738
You have three days to fix it.

661
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:08,337
What are you doing?

662
00:33:09,498 --> 00:33:10,738
to rent an apartment

663
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:11,738
You live here?

664
00:33:12,218 --> 00:33:13,538
I have to make it clear.

665
00:33:13,738 --> 00:33:14,817
Is to share with me.

666
00:33:15,218 --> 00:33:16,218
Indifferent

667
00:33:17,097 --> 00:33:18,018
How big is the house?

668
00:33:18,018 --> 00:33:18,857
What direction?

669
00:33:19,538 --> 00:33:20,617
It's more than 20.

670
00:33:20,617 --> 00:33:21,498
To the south.

671
00:33:21,498 --> 00:33:22,538
Twenty-one and twenty-nine.

672
00:33:22,538 --> 00:33:23,698
It's all over 20.

673
00:33:24,817 --> 00:33:25,538
How big is it?

674
00:33:27,057 --> 00:33:28,377
Why are you so stubborn?

675
00:33:29,857 --> 00:33:30,577
How big is it?

676
00:33:30,577 --> 00:33:32,178
I don't know. I have no idea.

677
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:32,778
anyway

678
00:33:32,978 --> 00:33:33,698
It's not small.

679
00:33:35,258 --> 00:33:36,258
It's cheaper.

680
00:33:36,258 --> 00:33:38,057
This is my lowest price.

681
00:33:45,778 --> 00:33:46,258
How about this?

682
00:33:47,298 --> 00:33:48,337
I'll pay for the internet.

683
00:33:48,337 --> 00:33:49,617
We share the water and electricity.

684
00:33:49,617 --> 00:33:50,377
Alright?

685
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:51,538
I'm not online.

686
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:54,577
If you don't go online,

687
00:33:54,577 --> 00:33:55,538
What are you doing?

688
00:33:56,857 --> 00:33:58,298
The glasses are so thick.

689
00:33:58,778 --> 00:33:59,778
You are a perfect student.

690
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:02,938
You can read books every day.

691
00:34:02,938 --> 00:34:03,298
I'm telling you,

692
00:34:03,298 --> 00:34:04,778
It's no use reading.

693
00:34:04,778 --> 00:34:05,778
It's nothing.

694
00:34:16,538 --> 00:34:17,377
Calm down.

695
00:34:19,298 --> 00:34:20,178
You're An Lan, right?

696
00:34:22,738 --> 00:34:24,178
You don't remember me?

697
00:34:24,178 --> 00:34:25,538
I stayed in grade two and went to your class.

698
00:34:25,538 --> 00:34:26,337
At the edge of the platform.

699
00:34:27,337 --> 00:34:27,817
I

700
00:34:28,538 --> 00:34:29,538
Xiao Feng.

701
00:34:38,698 --> 00:34:39,218
No

702
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,538
You don't want to rent it?

703
00:34:43,538 --> 00:34:44,298
Let go of Xiao Feng.

704
00:34:44,298 --> 00:34:44,817
Don't.

705
00:34:44,817 --> 00:34:45,778
Hold on.

706
00:34:45,778 --> 00:34:47,337
Since we are old schoolmates,

707
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:48,778
You don't need 300, you need 250.

708
00:34:48,778 --> 00:34:49,817
You're only 250.

709
00:34:49,817 --> 00:34:50,498
I'm not staying.

710
00:34:53,337 --> 00:34:54,298
It's so cheap.

711
00:34:54,298 --> 00:34:55,298
Do you have a problem with me?

712
00:34:55,298 --> 00:34:56,738
Who gets close to the vermilion.

713
00:34:56,738 --> 00:34:57,857
Who keeps company with the wolf will learn to howl

714
00:34:57,857 --> 00:34:58,938
Next to you, a repeater,

715
00:34:58,938 --> 00:35:00,097
How did I get into graduate school?

716
00:35:04,258 --> 00:35:05,298
And look down on you.

717
00:35:05,817 --> 00:35:07,817
I have to let you stay here today.

718
00:35:08,377 --> 00:35:09,298
Two hundred and four.

719
00:35:10,218 --> 00:35:10,978
Three hundred.

720
00:35:14,857 --> 00:35:15,538
Two hundred.

721
00:35:17,978 --> 00:35:18,577
Deal

722
00:35:20,698 --> 00:35:20,938
come

723
00:35:21,298 --> 00:35:21,538
please

724
00:35:24,938 --> 00:35:25,298
What about

725
00:35:28,178 --> 00:35:29,377
Which room do I live in?

726
00:35:29,778 --> 00:35:30,057
here

727
00:35:33,617 --> 00:35:34,018
What about

728
00:35:34,817 --> 00:35:35,538
It's very transparent.

729
00:35:36,298 --> 00:35:37,857
Whose boxes are these?

730
00:35:38,817 --> 00:35:39,817
These?

731
00:35:39,817 --> 00:35:40,738
My former teammates

732
00:35:41,577 --> 00:35:42,857
Ex-girlfriend

733
00:35:42,857 --> 00:35:43,617
boyfriend

734
00:35:45,617 --> 00:35:46,538
I'm teasing you.

735
00:35:46,538 --> 00:35:47,498
You're a perfect student.

736
00:35:49,337 --> 00:35:51,178
Give me the key to this room.

737
00:35:51,577 --> 00:35:52,258
key

738
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:55,057
My ex-boyfriend and I never lock the door.

739
00:35:55,538 --> 00:35:56,538
Look at my room.

740
00:35:56,538 --> 00:35:57,738
There's no door.

741
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:58,538
Give me the key.

742
00:35:59,337 --> 00:36:00,538
I don't know where the key is.

743
00:36:02,057 --> 00:36:02,778
Give it to me.

744
00:36:03,817 --> 00:36:04,778
good

745
00:36:18,778 --> 00:36:19,377
This is too much.

746
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:20,018
Find it yourself.

747
00:36:24,577 --> 00:36:25,458
By the way,

748
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:27,018
The bathroom.

749
00:36:27,298 --> 00:36:29,498
This is the kitchen and the living room.

750
00:36:38,097 --> 00:36:39,377
No, Big Sister.

751
00:36:39,377 --> 00:36:41,178
Can we be polite?

752
00:36:41,178 --> 00:36:42,538
I haven't finished yet.

753
00:36:42,538 --> 00:36:44,577
Don't enter my room without my consent.

754
00:36:44,938 --> 00:36:47,057
Who can enter your room?

755
00:36:47,698 --> 00:36:49,538
We have been classmates for so many years.

756
00:36:49,857 --> 00:36:51,298
Did I look at you more often?

757
00:36:52,298 --> 00:36:52,618
besides

758
00:36:52,618 --> 00:36:54,138
You're not pretty.

759
00:36:54,857 --> 00:36:56,778
Even if you look like a fairy,

760
00:36:57,138 --> 00:36:59,178
You're wearing glasses.

761
00:36:59,178 --> 00:36:59,817
You know I have the Four Eyes.

762
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:00,778
Just one word.

763
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:01,738
ugly

764
00:37:03,058 --> 00:37:03,857
Only shallow people

765
00:37:03,857 --> 00:37:05,658
You don't know how to appreciate the meaning of others.

766
00:37:05,658 --> 00:37:07,817
I'll invite you to go to the public.

767
00:37:07,817 --> 00:37:08,857
And dressed up.

768
00:37:08,857 --> 00:37:11,377
To maintain the most basic politeness between people.

769
00:37:11,857 --> 00:37:12,658
a row

770
00:37:12,817 --> 00:37:13,337
I'm telling you,

771
00:37:13,337 --> 00:37:14,658
My body

772
00:37:14,658 --> 00:37:16,298
I will cover it up.

773
00:37:16,298 --> 00:37:17,857
I won't let you take advantage.

774
00:37:20,778 --> 00:37:21,618
first

775
00:37:21,817 --> 00:37:23,417
I have no interest in you.

776
00:37:23,417 --> 00:37:24,218
second

777
00:37:24,218 --> 00:37:25,618
Install a door in your room.

778
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:26,457
Within two days,

779
00:37:26,457 --> 00:37:28,058
Or I'll cancel the lease.

780
00:37:28,058 --> 00:37:29,258
You have a door here.

781
00:37:29,258 --> 00:37:30,738
I have to have a door, right?

782
00:37:30,738 --> 00:37:31,138
no

783
00:37:32,138 --> 00:37:32,778
No way.

784
00:37:52,778 --> 00:37:53,698
See clearly.

785
00:37:53,698 --> 00:37:54,937
I have installed this door for you.

786
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:02,618
Why did you put your clothes in the fridge?

787
00:38:02,857 --> 00:38:04,738
The refrigerator has stopped cooling.

788
00:38:04,738 --> 00:38:06,417
So I have to reuse the wardrobe.

789
00:38:08,817 --> 00:38:10,417
Fix it.

790
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:12,817
It's written in black and white on your advertisement.

791
00:38:12,817 --> 00:38:14,098
The appliances are complete.

792
00:38:14,098 --> 00:38:15,817
I'm still breathing.

793
00:38:15,817 --> 00:38:17,298
Are you finished?

794
00:38:17,298 --> 00:38:18,977
And apply the disinfectant three times.

795
00:38:22,058 --> 00:38:24,337
Four Eyes, I installed the door

796
00:38:24,337 --> 00:38:25,658
To tell you that

797
00:38:25,658 --> 00:38:27,337
You're not the only one who can slam the door.

798
00:38:27,337 --> 00:38:28,298
I will.

799
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:46,977
feed

800
00:38:46,977 --> 00:38:47,497
Lu Xiao Bei,

801
00:38:47,497 --> 00:38:48,778
I can't stand it anymore.

802
00:38:48,778 --> 00:38:49,457
I'm telling you,

803
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:51,377
Get this woman out of my house.

804
00:38:51,377 --> 00:38:53,658
Whether I have her or not,

805
00:38:54,218 --> 00:38:56,058
Cheng Hao, calm down.

806
00:38:56,058 --> 00:38:58,298
What's up

807
00:38:58,298 --> 00:38:59,218
She took my room.

808
00:38:59,218 --> 00:38:59,937
I won't talk about it.

809
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:01,778
She even changed my wireless password.

810
00:39:01,778 --> 00:39:03,058
That's too bullying.

811
00:39:03,058 --> 00:39:04,778
You're on the offline.

812
00:39:04,778 --> 00:39:06,298
My fans are waiting for me.

813
00:39:06,897 --> 00:39:08,377
You're still live.

814
00:39:08,377 --> 00:39:09,738
You have 100,000 followers.

815
00:39:09,738 --> 00:39:11,298
99,000 were bought with money.

816
00:39:11,298 --> 00:39:12,658
Don't think I didn't know.

817
00:39:12,658 --> 00:39:13,417
People like you

818
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:15,058
Who can't eat the grapes.

819
00:39:15,058 --> 00:39:15,817
I've seen a lot of them.

820
00:39:15,817 --> 00:39:16,417
Cut the crap.

821
00:39:16,417 --> 00:39:17,417
Turn on the computer.

822
00:39:17,417 --> 00:39:19,058
Pick a game for me face to face.

823
00:39:19,058 --> 00:39:20,698
Pick a fight with me. Torture me.

824
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,738
Are you match me?

825
00:39:23,738 --> 00:39:24,258
Do I deserve it?

826
00:39:24,258 --> 00:39:25,298
I want a key.

827
00:39:25,298 --> 00:39:26,258
You asked me if I deserve it.

828
00:39:26,258 --> 00:39:26,738
Hum

829
00:39:26,738 --> 00:39:27,778
Lu Xiao Bei, did you hear that?

830
00:39:36,298 --> 00:39:36,937
Hi.

831
00:39:38,058 --> 00:39:40,298
I recruited a new player today.

832
00:39:40,298 --> 00:39:41,857
Her name is Su Jiayi.

833
00:39:42,258 --> 00:39:43,178
It's a girl.

834
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:45,578
She's quite special.

835
00:39:45,897 --> 00:39:46,857
You're really good at stirring up trouble.

836
00:39:47,897 --> 00:39:49,098
But it's okay.

837
00:39:49,417 --> 00:39:50,377
She's a good shot.

838
00:39:51,457 --> 00:39:52,298
I trusted her very much.

839
00:39:54,738 --> 00:39:55,897
Recently,

840
00:39:56,178 --> 00:39:58,738
And met a stranger girl.

841
00:39:59,778 --> 00:40:00,937
Her name is Chu Ge.

842
00:40:01,178 --> 00:40:02,058
Is my deskmate.

843
00:40:04,457 --> 00:40:05,857
The girl is really weird.

844
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:08,698
I can always find a way to get you in trouble.

845
00:40:10,897 --> 00:40:12,298
According to the Internet,

846
00:40:12,497 --> 00:40:13,817
Women are made of water.

847
00:40:14,298 --> 00:40:15,337
Men are made of earth.

848
00:40:16,258 --> 00:40:17,937
This is probably the legendary

849
00:40:18,218 --> 00:40:19,578
The environment is not good.

850
00:40:24,778 --> 00:40:26,618
The Hundred Cities League is about to begin.

851
00:40:27,298 --> 00:40:29,138
But I don't know how to start.

852
00:40:30,937 --> 00:40:31,658
I don't know either

853
00:40:31,658 --> 00:40:32,698
If I fail,

854
00:40:33,778 --> 00:40:34,778
What will I face?

855
00:40:37,857 --> 00:40:38,778
But it's okay.

856
00:40:40,298 --> 00:40:41,298
I won't be destroyed.

857
00:40:42,337 --> 00:40:45,058
I will...

858
00:40:45,937 --> 00:40:47,178
Will become stronger.

859
00:40:48,897 --> 00:40:49,417
Just wait and see.

860
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:01,377
What are you doing?

861
00:41:01,897 --> 00:41:03,218
Cockroach, look.

862
00:41:03,218 --> 00:41:03,857
cockroach

863
00:41:05,298 --> 00:41:06,098
Give it to me.

864
00:41:06,098 --> 00:41:06,778
No way

865
00:41:06,778 --> 00:41:08,178
There are so many people here.

866
00:41:08,738 --> 00:41:09,417
You're spritzing.

867
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:10,178
The cockroach was poisoned.

868
00:41:10,178 --> 00:41:11,298
I poisoned you first.

869
00:41:12,698 --> 00:41:13,298
Give it to me.

870
00:41:14,417 --> 00:41:15,337
Cockroaches can fly.

871
00:41:15,337 --> 00:41:16,658
You can't hide from the ceiling.

872
00:41:16,897 --> 00:41:17,778
Come down.

873
00:41:18,937 --> 00:41:19,738
come down

874
00:41:19,738 --> 00:41:20,497
No way

875
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:21,417
hurry up

876
00:41:25,658 --> 00:41:26,778
Did you eat instant noodles?

877
00:41:27,258 --> 00:41:28,258
How do you know?

878
00:41:29,258 --> 00:41:30,778
Get down. Get out.

879
00:41:32,258 --> 00:41:32,618
Get out of here.

880
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:33,457
over there

881
00:41:35,417 --> 00:41:36,298
hurry up

882
00:41:37,817 --> 00:41:38,337
Close the door.

883
00:42:03,578 --> 00:42:04,817
What's this?

884
00:42:06,778 --> 00:42:07,377
To catch cockroaches.

885
00:42:12,457 --> 00:42:13,417
What's the principle?

886
00:42:14,857 --> 00:42:15,698
What principle?

887
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:19,778
Look.

888
00:42:19,778 --> 00:42:20,698
Do not

889
00:42:21,778 --> 00:42:24,178
It's a principle that can't be learned from books.

890
00:42:24,178 --> 00:42:25,497
It's called living wisdom.

891
00:42:26,138 --> 00:42:27,218
You nerds,

892
00:42:27,218 --> 00:42:28,058
I'll never learn it in my lifetime.

893
00:42:30,218 --> 00:42:30,977
Correct!

894
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,457
I should remind you that

895
00:42:32,778 --> 00:42:34,738
Like snacks and instant noodles.

896
00:42:34,937 --> 00:42:36,298
If you open it, you must finish it.

897
00:42:36,298 --> 00:42:36,817
If you can't finish it,

898
00:42:36,817 --> 00:42:37,497
Throw it away.

899
00:42:37,817 --> 00:42:39,178
Except cockroaches,

900
00:42:39,178 --> 00:42:40,457
The mice will kill you.

901
00:42:42,138 --> 00:42:42,457
you

902
00:42:43,977 --> 00:42:45,937
You have to take these out. I won't move them.

903
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:49,618
You're so scared.

904
00:42:50,897 --> 00:42:51,298
Correct!

905
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:54,897
This is sprayed with insecticide.

906
00:42:54,897 --> 00:42:55,618
I threw it away for you.

907
00:42:56,937 --> 00:42:57,937
This one hasn't been opened.

908
00:42:57,937 --> 00:42:58,457
I'll help you eat it.

909
00:43:16,337 --> 00:43:16,937
Alright

910
00:43:17,658 --> 00:43:18,138
For the last time,

911
00:43:57,857 --> 00:43:58,218
feed

912
00:43:58,738 --> 00:43:58,977
feed

913
00:44:02,178 --> 00:44:03,857
Are you a liar?

914
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:04,857
It's me.

915
00:44:04,897 --> 00:44:06,417
Where are we?

916
00:44:06,417 --> 00:44:08,778
It doesn't matter.

917
00:44:08,778 --> 00:44:09,618
By the way, bro,

918
00:44:09,618 --> 00:44:10,897
I want to ask you.

919
00:44:10,897 --> 00:44:12,937
How did you know that Liu Xiang withdrew?

920
00:44:12,937 --> 00:44:14,258
Stop pretending.

921
00:44:14,658 --> 00:44:16,457
You really think you're from 2008?

922
00:44:16,618 --> 00:44:17,618
nonsense

923
00:44:17,658 --> 00:44:19,298
Aren't you from 2008?

924
00:44:19,298 --> 00:44:20,417
2008

925
00:44:20,698 --> 00:44:21,298
I'm seven.

926
00:44:21,497 --> 00:44:22,337
What about now?

927
00:44:22,698 --> 00:44:23,497
Now 19,

928
00:44:23,857 --> 00:44:25,138
Are we really crossing over?

929
00:44:25,337 --> 00:44:26,897
It's not called crossing.

930
00:44:27,218 --> 00:44:28,417
The connection between time and space.

931
00:44:28,417 --> 00:44:29,658
The premise is that

932
00:44:29,658 --> 00:44:31,298
Are you really Xiao Feng from 2008?

933
00:44:31,298 --> 00:44:33,298
I'm really Xiao Feng.

934
00:44:33,298 --> 00:44:34,497
replacement guaranteed if not genuine

935
00:44:34,658 --> 00:44:36,457
How can you believe me?

936
00:44:36,457 --> 00:44:38,337
Send me your championship trophy.

937
00:44:38,698 --> 00:44:39,817
I believe you.

938
00:44:39,817 --> 00:44:41,698
Where did I get the championship trophy?

939
00:44:41,698 --> 00:44:42,977
The troops have been dismissed.

940
00:44:43,258 --> 00:44:44,178
I've stopped playing games.

941
00:44:44,178 --> 00:44:45,658
The troops indeed broke up once.

942
00:44:45,817 --> 00:44:47,058
But they reorganized soon.

943
00:44:47,058 --> 00:44:48,457
Then they took down

944
00:44:48,457 --> 00:44:50,417
The winner of the National Challenge.

945
00:44:50,417 --> 00:44:51,937
To open a new era.

946
00:44:53,138 --> 00:44:54,337
Since then,

947
00:44:54,337 --> 00:44:55,738
Video game competition.

948
00:44:55,937 --> 00:44:57,417
It has a new name.

949
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,218
It's called e-sports.

950
00:44:59,658 --> 00:45:01,337
Give me your address.

951
00:45:01,337 --> 00:45:02,497
Why do you want my address?

952
00:45:02,857 --> 00:45:03,857
I'm sending you a letter.

953
00:45:04,138 --> 00:45:05,258
Why are you sending me a letter?

954
00:45:05,258 --> 00:45:06,977
You don't believe me.

955
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:10,457
I must make you believe me this time.

956
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:11,457
a row

957
00:45:12,218 --> 00:45:13,857
Then send it to

958
00:45:14,298 --> 00:45:16,298
No.122, Nanshan Road

959
00:45:16,298 --> 00:45:17,298
Nanshan Police Station.

960
00:45:18,138 --> 00:45:19,857
Lu Tianming, turn to Xiao Bei.

961
00:45:20,618 --> 00:45:22,417
You live in the police station.

962
00:45:22,817 --> 00:45:23,937
This is my dad's office.

963
00:45:27,817 --> 00:45:28,298
feed

964
00:45:29,258 --> 00:45:30,298
Can you hear me?

965
00:45:30,658 --> 00:45:32,098
Hello, are you still there?

966
00:45:32,098 --> 00:45:32,497
feed

967
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:42,578
The champion.

968
00:45:44,937 --> 00:45:46,497
Am I dreaming?

969
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:48,857
Or are you dreaming?

970
00:46:09,618 --> 00:46:10,778
what are you doing?

971
00:46:11,138 --> 00:46:11,857
Do you have any paper?

972
00:46:11,857 --> 00:46:12,738
Lend me some.

973
00:46:12,897 --> 00:46:13,817
to wait a moment

974
00:46:15,618 --> 00:46:16,377
You don't have to pay it back.

975
00:46:16,778 --> 00:46:18,178
This is so ordinary.

976
00:46:18,178 --> 00:46:19,298
Do you have a pattern?

977
00:46:19,298 --> 00:46:20,497
The one and only pattern.

978
00:46:20,497 --> 00:46:21,258
No

979
00:46:21,258 --> 00:46:22,497
My family is not a supermarket.

980
00:46:24,897 --> 00:46:25,658
Do you have an envelope?

981
00:46:26,098 --> 00:46:27,817
Why do you need the envelope?

982
00:46:28,658 --> 00:46:29,178
Urgent business

983
00:46:29,298 --> 00:46:31,258
I'm writing a very important letter.

984
00:46:31,258 --> 00:46:31,738
to wait a moment

985
00:46:37,698 --> 00:46:39,058
There's no envelope.

986
00:46:39,058 --> 00:46:41,738
This is unique. I'll give it to you.
