1
00:02:02,052 --> 00:02:02,624
Where are you going?

2
00:02:03,064 --> 00:02:04,105
I will go wherever I want.

3
00:02:04,505 --> 00:02:05,304
It's none of your business.

4
00:02:05,304 --> 00:02:05,784
No

5
00:02:05,784 --> 00:02:07,025
Everyone is angry.

6
00:02:07,144 --> 00:02:08,304
No one wants you to leave.

7
00:02:08,304 --> 00:02:09,304
Why don't I leave?

8
00:02:10,144 --> 00:02:11,305
Go back and apologize, right?

9
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:11,904
Don't worry.

10
00:02:11,904 --> 00:02:13,465
I won't apologize today.

11
00:02:13,465 --> 00:02:15,145
Don't mention the apology to me.

12
00:02:16,185 --> 00:02:17,945
This is a very important time for the competition.

13
00:02:17,945 --> 00:02:18,945
The bad mood will affect

14
00:02:18,945 --> 00:02:20,305
The normal performance of the whole game.

15
00:02:20,305 --> 00:02:21,384
So I want you to apologize.

16
00:02:21,384 --> 00:02:22,584
To solve the problem.

17
00:02:22,584 --> 00:02:24,704
You think apologizing now will solve the problem?

18
00:02:25,424 --> 00:02:25,945
You know what?

19
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,025
Since you came,

20
00:02:27,345 --> 00:02:28,545
Everything has changed.

21
00:02:28,945 --> 00:02:31,144
Why do they all support Chang Sha?

22
00:02:31,144 --> 00:02:32,865
No one can say a word for me.

23
00:02:32,865 --> 00:02:34,384
Because I was wrong?

24
00:02:37,665 --> 00:02:39,104
I know that as the leader,

25
00:02:39,265 --> 00:02:40,305
A lot of immaturity.

26
00:02:40,305 --> 00:02:41,704
There are many improper places.

27
00:02:42,265 --> 00:02:43,625
Please understand.

28
00:02:44,144 --> 00:02:44,824
What are you talking about?

29
00:02:45,784 --> 00:02:47,665
If you don't learn it well,

30
00:02:49,025 --> 00:02:50,424
Don't you want a good job?

31
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:53,265
You insisted on coming to our team.

32
00:02:53,265 --> 00:02:55,625
In the relationship between our brothers?

33
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:02,505
The competition is tomorrow.

34
00:03:02,865 --> 00:03:05,264
You know it's not easy for the team to play today.

35
00:03:06,505 --> 00:03:07,665
I really can't live without you.

36
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:09,025
Let's go back, Kirin.

37
00:03:16,585 --> 00:03:17,865
You know it's not easy.

38
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,865
If I'm really as important as you say,

39
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:24,665
They should be stopping me now.

40
00:03:25,744 --> 00:03:26,544
Instead of you.

41
00:03:29,384 --> 00:03:30,585
I have nothing to say to you.

42
00:03:52,184 --> 00:03:53,065
sorry

43
00:03:53,425 --> 00:03:54,464
I failed to persuade him back.

44
00:03:54,624 --> 00:03:55,665
His donkey temper

45
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:56,945
Even the train can't hold him.

46
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:58,505
It's my problem.

47
00:03:58,824 --> 00:04:00,025
To cause trouble to everyone.

48
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:01,705
It's not your problem.

49
00:04:02,025 --> 00:04:02,824
That's his problem.

50
00:04:02,984 --> 00:04:04,145
What is he doing?

51
00:04:04,425 --> 00:04:06,025
Kirin didn't answer the phone.

52
00:04:06,385 --> 00:04:07,025
Stop fighting.

53
00:04:09,705 --> 00:04:11,504
If Brother Qilian doesn't come back,

54
00:04:12,064 --> 00:04:13,305
What about the next competition?

55
00:04:15,825 --> 00:04:16,385
monkey

56
00:04:17,145 --> 00:04:17,624
Go.

57
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:18,624
I have no problem with it.

58
00:04:18,985 --> 00:04:20,265
But let's get this straight.

59
00:04:20,464 --> 00:04:21,944
Kirin is the most powerful gun in our team.

60
00:04:21,944 --> 00:04:23,305
I can't compete with him.

61
00:04:23,385 --> 00:04:24,464
Just let go of it.

62
00:04:25,025 --> 00:04:26,305
Fill the hole first.

63
00:04:26,425 --> 00:04:27,904
I'll adjust the tactics.

64
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:28,825
It's all gone.

65
00:04:29,705 --> 00:04:30,504
Go home and have a good rest.

66
00:04:55,105 --> 00:04:56,145
It's my fault.

67
00:04:56,224 --> 00:04:57,224
I failed to patch the hole.

68
00:04:57,305 --> 00:04:58,705
I'm not feeling well today.

69
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:00,025
It's all my fault.

70
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:01,744
The last two rounds were too hesitant.

71
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:02,705
That's enough.

72
00:05:02,865 --> 00:05:04,184
The sky hasn't fallen yet.

73
00:05:04,344 --> 00:05:05,064
Don't be downhearted.

74
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:06,064
It's like the end of the world.

75
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:06,944
You lost today.

76
00:05:06,944 --> 00:05:08,064
Is my responsibility as captain.

77
00:05:08,545 --> 00:05:10,224
You can come back tomorrow.

78
00:05:10,305 --> 00:05:12,064
Next time, let's fight against the King.

79
00:05:12,224 --> 00:05:13,585
Guangzhou Division Triple Crown Winner

80
00:05:13,585 --> 00:05:14,105
Even worse.

81
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,344
Are old hands.

82
00:05:15,624 --> 00:05:16,425
What's so scary?

83
00:05:16,585 --> 00:05:17,985
What have we never suffered?

84
00:05:18,784 --> 00:05:20,585
It's hard to learn from the west.

85
00:05:20,744 --> 00:05:21,784
Where were you?

86
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:22,265
Right?

87
00:05:24,545 --> 00:05:26,504
I'm not going out for dinner tonight.

88
00:05:26,504 --> 00:05:28,265
I'll practice the running map in the hotel.

89
00:05:28,585 --> 00:05:29,464
I'm not going out.

90
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:35,224
Where is An Lan?

91
00:05:35,624 --> 00:05:37,464
She seems to have brought us a video.

92
00:05:37,985 --> 00:05:38,825
It's time to go.

93
00:05:39,184 --> 00:05:39,865
I'll make a call.

94
00:05:44,025 --> 00:05:44,585
I didn't answer it.

95
00:06:08,985 --> 00:06:09,464
Are you crying?

96
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:20,544
What are you crying about?

97
00:06:21,185 --> 00:06:22,185
Why are you laughing?

98
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,505
Of course I laughed. You cried.

99
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:26,304
You're still in the mood to laugh at such a time.

100
00:06:27,224 --> 00:06:28,664
Okay, go ahead.

101
00:06:28,784 --> 00:06:29,424
Why are you crying?

102
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,825
We could have won the game.

103
00:06:35,224 --> 00:06:36,864
We can advance if we win.

104
00:06:37,145 --> 00:06:38,104
But if I lose now,

105
00:06:38,104 --> 00:06:39,424
We don't even have a way out.

106
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:41,745
What's the point of going forward?

107
00:06:41,745 --> 00:06:43,344
You won in the end.

108
00:06:43,344 --> 00:06:45,185
How horrible the data of the King's Column is.

109
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:46,145
You know what?

110
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:47,984
They're the only ones

111
00:06:47,984 --> 00:06:49,385
The winning rate is the highest.

112
00:06:49,585 --> 00:06:50,304
The battle value of the players

113
00:06:50,304 --> 00:06:51,945
And a lot higher than others.

114
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:53,025
Even the committee said

115
00:06:53,025 --> 00:06:54,585
They are the favourites to win this year.

116
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,904
And the pig fat was slaughtered.

117
00:06:58,065 --> 00:06:59,664
I've watched their game footage.

118
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:00,984
It's not as strong as I thought.

119
00:07:00,984 --> 00:07:02,224
It's good for us to lose.

120
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:03,505
And exposed the problem.

121
00:07:03,945 --> 00:07:05,265
Don't worry.

122
00:07:05,864 --> 00:07:06,784
You will win in the end.

123
00:07:09,705 --> 00:07:10,945
Where is the confidence?

124
00:07:11,825 --> 00:07:13,265
If a man wants to be successful,

125
00:07:13,505 --> 00:07:15,625
You have to have some unrealistic confidence.

126
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,025
Do you know what this skill is called?

127
00:07:18,025 --> 00:07:19,025
to know no shame

128
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:23,864
Neuropathy

129
00:07:23,864 --> 00:07:24,424
That's enough.

130
00:07:28,784 --> 00:07:29,385
You're laughing.

131
00:07:29,904 --> 00:07:30,424
No

132
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:44,464
Xiaobei

133
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,864
You're the new captain.

134
00:07:45,864 --> 00:07:47,185
Besides Liu Xu and Xiao Fei,

135
00:07:47,185 --> 00:07:49,025
The other three are willing to stay.

136
00:07:49,145 --> 00:07:50,664
What else do you need?

137
00:07:50,664 --> 00:07:51,265
What's the condition?

138
00:07:51,265 --> 00:07:52,065
Whatever.

139
00:07:52,065 --> 00:07:53,224
Mention it while I'm happy.

140
00:07:54,745 --> 00:07:55,784
I don't need anything else.

141
00:07:55,945 --> 00:07:57,104
There's something.

142
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,265
I want to ask you

143
00:07:58,864 --> 00:08:00,304
It's my own people.

144
00:08:00,304 --> 00:08:01,745
Tell me what you want.

145
00:08:02,745 --> 00:08:04,585
I heard that

146
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:05,904
Is also a crossfire professional.

147
00:08:06,065 --> 00:08:06,464
Really?

148
00:08:08,304 --> 00:08:08,945
say no more

149
00:08:08,945 --> 00:08:10,945
It can't compare with the past.

150
00:08:10,945 --> 00:08:12,664
I just like it personally.

151
00:08:12,864 --> 00:08:15,104
And the family doesn't need me to earn money.

152
00:08:15,265 --> 00:08:16,784
I formed a team at that time.

153
00:08:16,904 --> 00:08:18,265
It's called King of Kings.

154
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:19,585
Don't look at the name.

155
00:08:19,945 --> 00:08:21,705
Our team was in southern China.

156
00:08:21,705 --> 00:08:22,705
But boss,

157
00:08:22,705 --> 00:08:23,705
Who are you going to kill?

158
00:08:23,705 --> 00:08:25,025
In the early days of e-sports,

159
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:26,745
Are supported by a bunch of rich kids.

160
00:08:26,945 --> 00:08:28,464
Later, after the capital entered,

161
00:08:28,664 --> 00:08:30,625
Those old people are gone.

162
00:08:30,825 --> 00:08:33,185
Do you know Xiao Feng?

163
00:08:33,464 --> 00:08:34,505
Xiao Feng, Seven.

164
00:08:34,945 --> 00:08:35,385
Yes

165
00:08:35,664 --> 00:08:38,265
No one has mentioned this name for a long time.

166
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,344
During the National Challenge,

167
00:08:41,464 --> 00:08:42,464
Was assigned to a group.

168
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,185
I still remember that game.

169
00:08:44,344 --> 00:08:46,145
Are you still in touch with him?

170
00:08:47,104 --> 00:08:48,784
After he won the championship,

171
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,864
The team suddenly disbanded.

172
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:52,385
We haven't contacted each other.

173
00:08:59,864 --> 00:09:00,745
Xiao Feng.

174
00:09:00,745 --> 00:09:01,385
Are you looking for me?

175
00:09:03,385 --> 00:09:04,505
Last time, we dropped the line in the middle of the chat.

176
00:09:04,705 --> 00:09:05,505
how could that be?

177
00:09:06,224 --> 00:09:07,265
My computer is broken.

178
00:09:07,265 --> 00:09:07,945
It was fixed.

179
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:09,385
You said that

180
00:09:09,385 --> 00:09:10,505
There's a way to find you.

181
00:09:10,745 --> 00:09:11,344
What can I do?

182
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:12,585
Go to Xu Wei.

183
00:09:12,825 --> 00:09:13,864
He's my best friend.

184
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:15,065
You told him you knew me.

185
00:09:15,065 --> 00:09:15,864
He will definitely help.

186
00:09:16,104 --> 00:09:16,664
Alright

187
00:09:16,984 --> 00:09:18,464
I hope to find you through him.

188
00:09:18,585 --> 00:09:19,145
to feel relieved

189
00:09:19,145 --> 00:09:20,625
He will definitely help you find me.

190
00:09:26,424 --> 00:09:27,265
Recently,

191
00:09:27,424 --> 00:09:28,505
How's the team relationship?

192
00:09:29,145 --> 00:09:29,825
What do you mean?

193
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:30,825
Namely

194
00:09:31,344 --> 00:09:32,385
The players

195
00:09:32,745 --> 00:09:33,505
Is there any conflict?

196
00:09:36,025 --> 00:09:38,065
We have a problem with the team, boss.

197
00:09:38,424 --> 00:09:39,505
The Kirin just left.

198
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,265
Don't play anymore.

199
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:43,424
Why do you suddenly want to ask this?

200
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:45,185
Nothing

201
00:09:46,224 --> 00:09:46,984
Play well.

202
00:09:47,185 --> 00:09:48,065
Waiting for you to win the championship.

203
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:54,424
I should have told you not to ask An Lan for me.

204
00:09:55,825 --> 00:09:56,625
What now?

205
00:09:58,385 --> 00:09:58,945
Look.

206
00:09:59,784 --> 00:10:00,745
Once she's not married,

207
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:02,224
Second, you're not with me.

208
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:04,344
Xu Wei is quite close to her.

209
00:10:04,544 --> 00:10:05,424
What does that mean?

210
00:10:06,945 --> 00:10:08,224
It means I'm out of luck.

211
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,704
An Lan gave it to you.

212
00:10:28,904 --> 00:10:30,345
It's a pity that I can't understand it.

213
00:10:34,145 --> 00:10:35,544
You're lucky.

214
00:10:37,064 --> 00:10:38,145
She chose you.

215
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,064
Don't worry.

216
00:10:41,064 --> 00:10:42,465
I will never be like the Kirin.

217
00:10:42,465 --> 00:10:43,784
To affect our relationship.

218
00:10:44,424 --> 00:10:45,424
You're my best brother.

219
00:10:45,904 --> 00:10:47,105
I really hope you and An Lan

220
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,345
To be happy in the future.

221
00:10:48,584 --> 00:10:49,145
Really

222
00:10:49,865 --> 00:10:51,064
I'm willing to quit.

223
00:10:51,345 --> 00:10:52,265
From now on,

224
00:10:52,704 --> 00:10:53,985
No one knows what will happen.

225
00:10:54,584 --> 00:10:55,505
Alright.

226
00:10:56,345 --> 00:10:57,824
Come on, it's easy to behave yourself.

227
00:10:58,904 --> 00:10:59,904
I can see that

228
00:11:00,944 --> 00:11:02,345
She really likes you.

229
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:05,465
Cherish it.

230
00:11:06,704 --> 00:11:07,824
You should study it carefully.

231
00:11:07,824 --> 00:11:09,064
How should we play tomorrow?

232
00:11:09,225 --> 00:11:09,824
For a while

233
00:11:10,145 --> 00:11:11,145
Call them all here.

234
00:11:11,424 --> 00:11:12,184
Study it.

235
00:11:20,184 --> 00:11:22,985
The melody you love is without you.

236
00:11:22,985 --> 00:11:25,465
How can there be a story?

237
00:11:35,745 --> 00:11:36,745
Am I disturbing you?

238
00:11:38,184 --> 00:11:38,784
No

239
00:11:40,304 --> 00:11:41,265
I heard you had a cold.

240
00:11:41,424 --> 00:11:42,105
Is it serious?

241
00:11:42,584 --> 00:11:43,345
It's not serious.

242
00:11:43,465 --> 00:11:43,985
Much better.

243
00:11:44,145 --> 00:11:44,704
Sit down

244
00:11:46,465 --> 00:11:47,345
Lemon honey water.

245
00:11:47,345 --> 00:11:48,145
It's good for your voice.

246
00:12:00,784 --> 00:12:01,625
Thank you, Senior Brother.

247
00:12:02,985 --> 00:12:04,064
Just call me by my name.

248
00:12:08,745 --> 00:12:09,385
What are you doing?

249
00:12:10,304 --> 00:12:12,064
I want to see if you have a fever.

250
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:13,584
You look red.

251
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:16,225
Sorry

252
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:17,824
I retreated a bit.

253
00:12:18,265 --> 00:12:19,304
It's 38 degrees 2.

254
00:12:19,544 --> 00:12:20,584
38 degrees.

255
00:12:20,584 --> 00:12:21,505
Did you take the medicine?

256
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:23,105
No need

257
00:12:23,385 --> 00:12:24,225
I'll be fine after a sleep.

258
00:12:24,345 --> 00:12:24,904
That's impossible.

259
00:12:24,904 --> 00:12:26,385
You must take the medicine.

260
00:12:28,145 --> 00:12:29,745
This school has been closed.

261
00:12:30,265 --> 00:12:31,145
I'll buy it for you outside.

262
00:12:31,505 --> 00:12:31,985
No, no.

263
00:12:32,745 --> 00:12:33,304
No need

264
00:12:33,784 --> 00:12:34,544
I really don't need it.

265
00:12:37,784 --> 00:12:39,664
As the director of this competition,

266
00:12:39,745 --> 00:12:41,184
I have the responsibility and obligation

267
00:12:41,184 --> 00:12:43,225
To ensure the health of my competitors.

268
00:12:52,265 --> 00:12:53,105
You're back.

269
00:12:55,225 --> 00:12:55,704
Check it out.

270
00:12:55,904 --> 00:12:57,265
Senior Gao sent it to you.

271
00:12:57,424 --> 00:12:58,345
Tell us about it.

272
00:12:58,584 --> 00:12:59,985
When did you know Senior Gao?

273
00:12:59,985 --> 00:13:02,145
He is recognized as one of the three talents of Southern Sports Team.

274
00:13:02,145 --> 00:13:03,145
The key is to be single.

275
00:13:04,865 --> 00:13:06,704
When we signed up.

276
00:13:06,944 --> 00:13:07,784
then

277
00:13:07,784 --> 00:13:09,105
He lent me the music room.

278
00:13:09,465 --> 00:13:10,465
And practiced the song twice.

279
00:13:12,304 --> 00:13:13,985
I borrowed the piano room to practice your music.

280
00:13:13,985 --> 00:13:15,025
Good gracious!

281
00:13:15,385 --> 00:13:16,985
It's so romantic.

282
00:13:36,145 --> 00:13:37,865
As long as the hoes are good,

283
00:13:37,865 --> 00:13:39,625
There's no wall. You can't dig it.

284
00:13:41,064 --> 00:13:41,944
What wall?

285
00:13:43,505 --> 00:13:44,145
Look for yourself.

286
00:13:47,944 --> 00:13:49,225
It's just a song.

287
00:13:49,944 --> 00:13:51,025
Where are you from?

288
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:53,584
Think about it.

289
00:13:54,304 --> 00:13:56,704
A person who never shares WeChat Moments.

290
00:13:56,704 --> 00:13:58,225
Suddenly, I posted a wechat moment.

291
00:13:58,225 --> 00:13:59,225
What do you mean?

292
00:14:00,184 --> 00:14:01,184
It's possible that

293
00:14:01,784 --> 00:14:03,025
There are some changes in life.

294
00:14:03,304 --> 00:14:03,944
That's normal.

295
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:05,105
She wants her life to change.

296
00:14:05,584 --> 00:14:06,985
Why didn't she send the text?

297
00:14:06,985 --> 00:14:07,784
No pictures.

298
00:14:07,784 --> 00:14:09,225
And sent a song.

299
00:14:09,824 --> 00:14:10,385
Let me ask you something.

300
00:14:10,385 --> 00:14:11,505
What does this song mean?

301
00:14:11,865 --> 00:14:13,664
Can it represent her current mood?

302
00:14:15,745 --> 00:14:16,424
Let's go again.

303
00:14:16,904 --> 00:14:17,944
Feel this song.

304
00:14:19,505 --> 00:14:22,865
Every time I miss you, I'm too honest.

305
00:14:22,865 --> 00:14:26,465
I begin to doubt that without you,

306
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,584
Finish the story.

307
00:14:28,584 --> 00:14:29,505
Whenever I look back,

308
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:31,824
Did you hear that?

309
00:14:32,424 --> 00:14:33,944
I love the melody.

310
00:14:34,145 --> 00:14:35,505
Isn't it obvious?

311
00:14:36,664 --> 00:14:37,985
What is it obvious?

312
00:14:37,985 --> 00:14:38,985
That song,

313
00:14:38,985 --> 00:14:40,465
It doesn't mean anything.

314
00:14:41,025 --> 00:14:42,184
eldest brother

315
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:44,865
You're having a love affair.

316
00:14:45,225 --> 00:14:46,304
To a new environment.

317
00:14:46,304 --> 00:14:47,544
All kinds of factors.

318
00:14:47,544 --> 00:14:48,225
Probably.

319
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:49,865
No, it's possible.

320
00:14:51,184 --> 00:14:52,385
She's in a relationship.

321
00:14:53,784 --> 00:14:55,304
I'm your boyfriend.

322
00:14:55,985 --> 00:14:56,625
eldest brother

323
00:14:56,704 --> 00:14:58,345
Take care of yourself.

324
00:15:00,865 --> 00:15:01,944
That's a good thing.

325
00:15:03,584 --> 00:15:04,345
I bless her.

326
00:15:04,345 --> 00:15:05,184
When she's in a relationship,

327
00:15:05,865 --> 00:15:07,505
And bless them.

328
00:15:07,505 --> 00:15:08,465
Come on.

329
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:09,745
What's your relationship?

330
00:15:09,745 --> 00:15:10,865
I don't know yet.

331
00:15:11,105 --> 00:15:11,904
Don't talk nonsense.

332
00:15:12,265 --> 00:15:12,865
Chu Ge and I

333
00:15:12,865 --> 00:15:13,544
That's pure.

334
00:15:16,704 --> 00:15:17,664
Chu Ge and I

335
00:15:17,824 --> 00:15:19,265
It's a pure friendship.

336
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:21,105
You have graduated from high school.

337
00:15:21,105 --> 00:15:22,745
He's already 18 years old.

338
00:15:22,745 --> 00:15:23,985
Can be appropriate.

339
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,345
It's not pure.

340
00:15:29,465 --> 00:15:30,944
If you can transfer your gossiping energy

341
00:15:30,944 --> 00:15:31,745
To train.

342
00:15:31,745 --> 00:15:32,865
Our team has already qualified.

343
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:33,944
Go to sleep.

344
00:15:34,824 --> 00:15:35,345
Xiaobei

345
00:15:35,584 --> 00:15:36,505
Just wait and see.

346
00:15:36,704 --> 00:15:37,584
You will suffer later.

347
00:15:38,424 --> 00:15:39,105
Don't regret it.

348
00:15:40,145 --> 00:15:41,184
Who cares? Who knows?

349
00:15:44,385 --> 00:15:45,184
I don't feel bad.

350
00:16:14,385 --> 00:16:15,625
Let's be realistic.

351
00:16:15,944 --> 00:16:17,664
The hole can't be filled.

352
00:16:17,865 --> 00:16:18,664
Or

353
00:16:18,824 --> 00:16:20,784
I'll call Brother Kirin again.

354
00:16:21,304 --> 00:16:23,265
Beg him to come back.

355
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:25,064
How about I call him?

356
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:26,184
Personal matters.

357
00:16:26,505 --> 00:16:29,625
Shouldn't be discussed with the team.

358
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:30,625
His bad temper

359
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,064
Like a stone in a cesspit.

360
00:16:32,064 --> 00:16:32,985
Stinky and hard.

361
00:16:33,465 --> 00:16:34,345
The phone call is over.

362
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,145
He even bought a ticket to Ning Jiang.

363
00:16:37,345 --> 00:16:38,025
It's my fault.

364
00:16:39,544 --> 00:16:40,664
But I really tried.

365
00:16:42,944 --> 00:16:43,784
Let's get this straight.

366
00:16:44,265 --> 00:16:46,544
The monkey played well in the Inferno.

367
00:16:46,544 --> 00:16:47,465
Why is it not working?

368
00:16:47,664 --> 00:16:50,584
The opponent is getting stronger.

369
00:16:50,584 --> 00:16:51,824
Our weakness

370
00:16:52,064 --> 00:16:53,385
More and more exposed.

371
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:54,745
That's why.

372
00:16:54,745 --> 00:16:55,824
But that's not the point.

373
00:16:56,105 --> 00:16:57,745
From the data,

374
00:16:57,745 --> 00:17:00,145
Kirin has the highest combat value in the team.

375
00:17:00,704 --> 00:17:01,625
monkey

376
00:17:02,664 --> 00:17:03,544
And ranked last.

377
00:17:05,184 --> 00:17:06,345
This is the key.

378
00:17:06,704 --> 00:17:08,584
We can't use him as the Kirin's commander.

379
00:17:08,784 --> 00:17:10,105
It won't work from the root.

380
00:17:10,745 --> 00:17:12,584
Even a monkey can't become a Kirin.

381
00:17:13,025 --> 00:17:14,064
No, I didn't mean that.

382
00:17:14,064 --> 00:17:14,824
Don't take it to heart, monkey.

383
00:17:15,345 --> 00:17:17,385
Is his best style of play.

384
00:17:17,385 --> 00:17:19,145
It's the running position and the shooting.

385
00:17:19,544 --> 00:17:21,385
You asked him to use the Kirin's style.

386
00:17:21,385 --> 00:17:22,184
It won't work.

387
00:17:22,745 --> 00:17:23,664
Your fighting value is low.

388
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:26,625
My combat value is low.

389
00:17:27,064 --> 00:17:28,424
Because it's awkward.

390
00:17:28,424 --> 00:17:29,145
It's been a long time.

391
00:17:29,145 --> 00:17:30,944
I lost my ability to manage my family.

392
00:17:38,345 --> 00:17:40,304
Isn't the monkey mending the hole?

393
00:17:40,745 --> 00:17:42,145
He can be used as a hidden weapon.

394
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:43,745
To poke holes in each other.

395
00:17:46,505 --> 00:17:47,025
But,

396
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,784
I'd like to remind you

397
00:17:49,385 --> 00:17:50,584
The King's Palace.

398
00:17:51,105 --> 00:17:52,584
It's really horrible.

399
00:17:55,584 --> 00:17:56,985
I'm dodging. Cover me.

400
00:17:56,985 --> 00:17:57,664
I'll flash it.

401
00:17:58,025 --> 00:17:58,345
Nothing

402
00:17:58,345 --> 00:17:59,265
There's an ambush at point A!

403
00:17:59,265 --> 00:17:59,904
There's one in the back.

404
00:17:59,904 --> 00:18:00,704
Watch your back.

405
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:01,745
Hurry up.

406
00:18:02,265 --> 00:18:02,824
I'm going to help.

407
00:18:02,824 --> 00:18:03,584
pretty

408
00:18:05,265 --> 00:18:06,184
Ming, go to point A.

409
00:18:06,184 --> 00:18:06,544
Received

410
00:18:07,865 --> 00:18:08,745
Monkey, stay here.

411
00:18:09,064 --> 00:18:09,345
good

412
00:18:10,584 --> 00:18:11,584
Captain, come with me to B.

413
00:18:11,584 --> 00:18:12,345
Receive it.

414
00:18:12,345 --> 00:18:13,145
Old Sha, go to the middle road.

415
00:18:13,145 --> 00:18:13,584
Received

416
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:19,265
Point A, someone is coming.

417
00:18:22,145 --> 00:18:22,784
There's an ambush in Avenue A.

418
00:18:23,824 --> 00:18:24,704
Captain, guard point B.

419
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:25,304
I'll go to Point A.

420
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:25,904
I'm coming.

421
00:18:27,824 --> 00:18:28,424
Someone.

422
00:18:29,465 --> 00:18:30,225
Point B.

423
00:18:30,225 --> 00:18:31,025
Old Sha, go and fix it.

424
00:18:31,025 --> 00:18:31,544
Report the location.

425
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:32,345
I dropped it in Avenue A.

426
00:18:32,465 --> 00:18:33,465
Monkey, monkey. Stay here.

427
00:18:33,465 --> 00:18:33,824
monkey

428
00:18:34,064 --> 00:18:34,465
good

429
00:18:35,145 --> 00:18:35,704
I saw one.

430
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:39,784
It's done.

431
00:18:40,824 --> 00:18:42,304
I dare not go out. It's all human.

432
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:42,904
Old Sha, hold on.

433
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:43,424
It's okay, Sand.

434
00:18:46,424 --> 00:18:47,584
I'm aiming at him.

435
00:18:56,145 --> 00:18:56,704
pretty

436
00:18:58,184 --> 00:18:59,945
Next round, just pay attention to point B.

437
00:19:00,225 --> 00:19:00,945
You can win them.

438
00:19:02,425 --> 00:19:02,824
come

439
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:07,064
You can't fight like this.

440
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:08,025
We need to change the tactics.

441
00:19:08,505 --> 00:19:09,225
The tactics are unchanged.

442
00:19:09,544 --> 00:19:10,665
Monkey, I believe you.

443
00:19:11,945 --> 00:19:12,344
but

444
00:19:12,745 --> 00:19:14,745
Brother Feng, it's not about whether you believe it or not.

445
00:19:14,745 --> 00:19:16,104
If we lose the next round,

446
00:19:16,225 --> 00:19:17,584
We all have to go home.

447
00:19:18,265 --> 00:19:19,344
It's ten to three.

448
00:19:19,344 --> 00:19:20,384
The three points we won

449
00:19:20,384 --> 00:19:22,104
It's all because the monkey opened it completely.

450
00:19:22,104 --> 00:19:23,144
To free us.

451
00:19:23,144 --> 00:19:24,384
It means our tactics are good.

452
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:25,824
The biggest problem we have now

453
00:19:25,824 --> 00:19:27,185
Everyone will commit some crimes.

454
00:19:27,185 --> 00:19:28,185
You shouldn't have made.

455
00:19:28,505 --> 00:19:30,304
These little mistakes together are fatal.

456
00:19:30,665 --> 00:19:32,064
So from the next round,

457
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:33,344
Please pay attention.

458
00:19:33,344 --> 00:19:34,584
Don't make the mistakes you shouldn't have made.

459
00:19:35,624 --> 00:19:36,425
Carry on with the original plan.

460
00:19:37,425 --> 00:19:37,624
good

461
00:19:37,745 --> 00:19:38,104
Come on

462
00:19:40,384 --> 00:19:40,745
monkey

463
00:19:44,104 --> 00:19:45,144
One, two, three.

464
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:45,784
The Coin Team.

465
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,144
They went to B.

466
00:20:09,505 --> 00:20:10,025
Behind the box,

467
00:20:10,025 --> 00:20:11,025
There's a dirty one behind the box.

468
00:20:11,025 --> 00:20:11,824
Ming, be careful.

469
00:20:14,064 --> 00:20:14,505
Kill one.

470
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:14,945
There's another one.

471
00:20:15,304 --> 00:20:16,665
The remaining two are all bloody.

472
00:20:16,665 --> 00:20:17,624
Don't let them get away.

473
00:20:17,624 --> 00:20:18,225
Old sand, old sand

474
00:20:18,225 --> 00:20:18,985
Received, received.

475
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:20,384
Hurry up. Let's go together.

476
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:20,945
Go after him.

477
00:20:23,465 --> 00:20:24,265
Someone.

478
00:20:24,425 --> 00:20:24,945
Old sand.

479
00:20:24,945 --> 00:20:25,465
I'm coming.

480
00:20:25,905 --> 00:20:27,144
The captain of the opposite team is gone.

481
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:28,705
Beautiful.

482
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:29,784
I dropped it too.

483
00:20:29,784 --> 00:20:30,465
Change it.

484
00:20:30,665 --> 00:20:31,584
Look at me. Watch me.

485
00:20:43,584 --> 00:20:45,584
You won. Beautiful.

486
00:20:46,344 --> 00:20:47,425
How are you guarding it?

487
00:20:47,905 --> 00:20:49,624
We'll stick to the original tactics.

488
00:20:49,784 --> 00:20:50,824
Monkey, stay here.

489
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:52,144
You believe you're fine.

490
00:20:52,144 --> 00:20:52,665
no problem

491
00:20:53,384 --> 00:20:53,864
Come on

492
00:20:55,144 --> 00:20:56,144
They're here. They are here.

493
00:20:56,144 --> 00:20:56,505
good

494
00:21:03,864 --> 00:21:05,265
pretty

495
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:06,864
There are two on my side.

496
00:21:06,864 --> 00:21:07,945
I'm coming, Lao Sha.

497
00:21:10,665 --> 00:21:11,985
I saw the monkey.

498
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:13,985
Old sand, old sand

499
00:21:13,985 --> 00:21:14,824
Look at the A point.

500
00:21:14,824 --> 00:21:15,624
Okay, copy that.

501
00:21:16,905 --> 00:21:17,384
Old sand.

502
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:19,425
It's okay.

503
00:21:19,425 --> 00:21:20,304
It's okay.

504
00:21:20,304 --> 00:21:21,265
There's a chance.

505
00:21:23,144 --> 00:21:24,064
pretty

506
00:21:24,064 --> 00:21:24,745
Monkey, unpack.

507
00:21:25,225 --> 00:21:25,584
fast

508
00:21:34,344 --> 00:21:35,505
four

509
00:21:35,505 --> 00:21:36,505
three

510
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:37,584
two

511
00:21:37,584 --> 00:21:38,505
one

512
00:21:48,985 --> 00:21:50,624
Monkey, monkey.

513
00:21:59,465 --> 00:22:05,824
The Coin Team.

514
00:22:08,265 --> 00:22:09,905
You're amazing.

515
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:13,784
The Coin Team.

516
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:24,985
I'm sorry.

517
00:22:26,824 --> 00:22:27,985
Are you blind?

518
00:22:28,465 --> 00:22:30,584
Watch your step from now on.

519
00:22:32,265 --> 00:22:34,624
I've got a good aim. I aim for you.

520
00:22:46,025 --> 00:22:46,665
Unicorn

521
00:22:47,544 --> 00:22:48,104
GAOPENG

522
00:23:09,225 --> 00:23:09,705
Unicorn

523
00:23:10,864 --> 00:23:13,064
Thanks to your accuracy today,

524
00:23:13,304 --> 00:23:15,465
How else would I know you're in Shenzhen?

525
00:23:15,745 --> 00:23:17,025
It's too boring.

526
00:23:18,584 --> 00:23:19,665
I'm not doing well.

527
00:23:20,425 --> 00:23:21,905
I can't face you.

528
00:23:23,144 --> 00:23:24,745
I have something to tell you.

529
00:23:24,864 --> 00:23:26,225
Actually, you're not bad anywhere.

530
00:23:26,425 --> 00:23:27,584
I followed the wrong person.

531
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:28,544
Do you know?

532
00:23:28,905 --> 00:23:30,304
Leave these poor people early.

533
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,784
You wouldn't be like this.

534
00:23:33,544 --> 00:23:34,384
Count me blind.

535
00:23:34,384 --> 00:23:35,225
Alright?

536
00:23:39,624 --> 00:23:41,465
Brother Zhong,

537
00:23:41,905 --> 00:23:43,104
Come here. Come and meet me.

538
00:23:45,344 --> 00:23:46,144
Brother Zhong.

539
00:23:46,985 --> 00:23:47,864
In Shenzhen,

540
00:23:47,864 --> 00:23:49,784
Zhong said the fish was flying in the sky.

541
00:23:50,064 --> 00:23:52,384
No one dared to say the fish was swimming in the water.

542
00:23:52,824 --> 00:23:53,505
Brother Zhong.

543
00:23:53,864 --> 00:23:55,784
His brother Kirin.

544
00:23:58,144 --> 00:23:58,864
Brother Zhong.

545
00:23:59,144 --> 00:24:01,344
Brother, I'm new here. I don't know much.

546
00:24:01,945 --> 00:24:03,064
I'll finish this cup.

547
00:24:03,624 --> 00:24:04,745
Make yourself at home.

548
00:24:22,225 --> 00:24:23,025
What about the show?

549
00:24:23,025 --> 00:24:23,705
Hua Zi.

550
00:24:24,265 --> 00:24:24,864
come

551
00:24:28,225 --> 00:24:29,185
Come and have a drink with me.

552
00:24:31,665 --> 00:24:33,824
Brother, let's have a drink.

553
00:25:14,864 --> 00:25:17,344
We are like

554
00:25:17,425 --> 00:25:19,304
In the melody,

555
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,824
Will never meet.

556
00:25:22,824 --> 00:25:24,505
staff

557
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:28,544
Why hasn't it come to Chu Ge yet?

558
00:25:30,824 --> 00:25:31,824
Don't worry.

559
00:25:31,945 --> 00:25:33,344
Great Gods always come on the last stage.

560
00:25:33,344 --> 00:25:34,025
Do you know

561
00:25:34,544 --> 00:25:35,665
Nezha.

562
00:25:36,144 --> 00:25:37,584
Call me later.

563
00:25:37,945 --> 00:25:38,505
other

564
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,705
Keep a low profile. Don't affect Chuge.

565
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,824
I'm telling you,

566
00:25:41,824 --> 00:25:44,064
It's the same as our game.

567
00:25:44,064 --> 00:25:44,784
Do you know

568
00:25:44,784 --> 00:25:45,985
No matter how strong we are,

569
00:25:46,185 --> 00:25:47,705
First, you have to show your power.

570
00:25:47,705 --> 00:25:49,344
To overwhelm the opponent in momentum.

571
00:25:49,665 --> 00:25:50,304
Do you know

572
00:25:50,624 --> 00:25:51,104
good

573
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,784
OK!

574
00:25:58,304 --> 00:26:00,064
Next, Contestant 204

575
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,945
Chu Ge from Grade 19 of School of Management.

576
00:26:02,945 --> 00:26:04,584
The song she brought to us is

577
00:26:04,584 --> 00:26:06,144
Dinner for one.

578
00:26:06,945 --> 00:26:07,985
Nezha, get ready.

579
00:26:07,985 --> 00:26:08,665
Shout for me.

580
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,905
Chu song

581
00:26:15,025 --> 00:26:16,784
The song of Chu.

582
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:17,945
Chuge, come on.

583
00:26:17,945 --> 00:26:19,624
Chu song

584
00:26:19,624 --> 00:26:22,584
Chuge, come on.

585
00:26:22,584 --> 00:26:24,584
Come on

586
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:26,064
Come on

587
00:26:26,425 --> 00:26:28,144
I love you, Chuge.

588
00:26:28,144 --> 00:26:28,985
It's better than heart.

589
00:26:36,745 --> 00:26:37,344
What's up

590
00:26:38,344 --> 00:26:39,025
I want to change the song.

591
00:26:39,384 --> 00:26:40,064
Change the song.

592
00:26:40,064 --> 00:26:40,945
But where are we going now?

593
00:26:40,945 --> 00:26:42,265
To find music for you.

594
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,425
I can sing it.

595
00:26:44,584 --> 00:26:46,104
But you should know the effect of a cappella.

596
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,905
It's definitely better than having an accompaniment.

597
00:26:47,905 --> 00:26:48,665
I can.

598
00:26:49,304 --> 00:26:49,745
Alright then.

599
00:26:49,745 --> 00:26:51,465
I'll leave the stage time to you.

600
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:54,665
The song of Chu.

601
00:26:54,665 --> 00:26:57,705
Chuge, come on.

602
00:26:57,705 --> 00:26:58,624
It's so beautiful.

603
00:26:58,624 --> 00:26:59,304
That's enough.

604
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:00,544
Come on

605
00:27:11,025 --> 00:27:13,384
This is your eyes.

606
00:27:13,584 --> 00:27:16,745
It falls on you.

607
00:27:17,425 --> 00:27:20,505
All the tired things.

608
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:23,025
All will be gone.

609
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:28,104
This is your face.

610
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:31,624
Like the calm waves,

611
00:27:32,185 --> 00:27:35,384
Let the mind full of shackles

612
00:27:35,384 --> 00:27:38,465
To be liberated.

613
00:27:39,025 --> 00:27:42,384
Did you see

614
00:27:43,265 --> 00:27:46,344
I said we are vulnerable.

615
00:27:46,905 --> 00:27:52,905
To recognize myself in countless times of fear.

616
00:27:53,665 --> 00:27:57,144
I hope you can see it.

617
00:27:57,985 --> 00:28:01,025
As the pile of time,

618
00:28:01,665 --> 00:28:04,584
This is an old heart.

619
00:28:04,665 --> 00:28:05,425
See?

620
00:28:05,425 --> 00:28:06,584
Can't hide.

621
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:07,745
What did I say?

622
00:28:07,745 --> 00:28:08,425
This new lover

623
00:28:08,425 --> 00:28:09,665
You're right.

624
00:28:10,144 --> 00:28:11,745
You and I

625
00:28:12,705 --> 00:28:15,544
Without too many words.

626
00:28:15,544 --> 00:28:17,745
The spark of love is coming.

627
00:28:17,745 --> 00:28:19,465
We are all smiling.

628
00:28:19,465 --> 00:28:22,304
Crying inside.

629
00:28:23,185 --> 00:28:26,665
Did you hear that?

630
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:30,665
From the heart.

631
00:28:31,225 --> 00:28:34,025
Like a loud bang.

632
00:28:34,344 --> 00:28:37,784
And fall into the abyss.

633
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:41,384
I hope you can hear it.

634
00:28:42,425 --> 00:28:44,025
Accept our loneliness.

635
00:28:44,025 --> 00:28:45,025
I can't stand it anymore.

636
00:28:45,945 --> 00:28:48,945
This is a heart that loves you.

637
00:28:49,225 --> 00:28:52,265
Can't hide.

638
00:28:53,384 --> 00:28:56,945
This is a heart that loves you.

639
00:28:58,265 --> 00:29:04,064
Can't hide.

640
00:29:25,624 --> 00:29:26,265
Xiaobei

641
00:29:26,705 --> 00:29:28,705
How about I sacrifice myself?

642
00:29:28,705 --> 00:29:29,745
Take the initiative.

643
00:29:29,945 --> 00:29:31,465
To get this senior brother.

644
00:29:31,465 --> 00:29:32,344
To help you two.

645
00:29:32,344 --> 00:29:33,265
You have to.

646
00:29:33,425 --> 00:29:34,304
Stop it.

647
00:29:34,544 --> 00:29:36,064
You are betraying the enemy.

648
00:29:36,465 --> 00:29:37,265
That's enough.

649
00:29:37,265 --> 00:29:39,025
Stop it.

650
00:29:39,465 --> 00:29:41,425
Xiao Bei, let's go back.

651
00:29:44,265 --> 00:29:45,025
What's the rush?

652
00:29:45,665 --> 00:29:46,425
The flowers haven't been sent yet.

653
00:29:46,864 --> 00:29:48,705
Don't you see the two of them are so passionate?

654
00:29:48,824 --> 00:29:50,225
You can be the third wheel.

655
00:29:50,544 --> 00:29:51,064
I'm telling you,

656
00:29:51,064 --> 00:29:53,025
You have to think long and hard if you want to steal the wall.

657
00:29:53,784 --> 00:29:54,945
The premiere was a great success.

658
00:29:55,344 --> 00:29:55,945
Congratulations.

659
00:29:57,985 --> 00:29:58,544
What are you doing?

660
00:29:58,905 --> 00:30:00,784
Isn't it forbidden to pick flowers in the park?

661
00:30:01,025 --> 00:30:02,185
Don't get caught.

662
00:30:02,304 --> 00:30:03,064
Don't worry.

663
00:30:03,304 --> 00:30:04,104
I found it on the floor.

664
00:30:04,624 --> 00:30:06,584
I don't know which unlucky girl failed to confess.

665
00:30:06,584 --> 00:30:07,465
I ran into him.

666
00:30:07,824 --> 00:30:09,144
It's good to borrow flowers.

667
00:30:11,225 --> 00:30:11,784
Chu song

668
00:30:12,384 --> 00:30:13,104
Please introduce them.

669
00:30:14,505 --> 00:30:15,784
This is my high school classmate.

670
00:30:15,864 --> 00:30:16,304
Lu Xiao Bei,

671
00:30:16,905 --> 00:30:18,584
And her ex-boyfriend.

672
00:30:19,265 --> 00:30:19,745
desk-mate

673
00:30:21,824 --> 00:30:22,544
Hello

674
00:30:23,104 --> 00:30:23,784
It's humorous.

675
00:30:29,104 --> 00:30:30,104
I didn't mean to.

676
00:30:30,425 --> 00:30:31,265
I didn't mean to.

677
00:30:37,665 --> 00:30:38,384
My name is Gao Bosong.

678
00:30:38,784 --> 00:30:39,784
It's higher than Chu Ge.

679
00:30:40,144 --> 00:30:41,905
You should take care of Chu Ge.

680
00:30:42,705 --> 00:30:43,304
Alright.

681
00:30:43,544 --> 00:30:44,064
no problem

682
00:30:44,304 --> 00:30:44,945
you're most welcome

683
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,265
Chuge is good at everything.

684
00:30:47,265 --> 00:30:48,945
Is not good at judging people.

685
00:30:49,824 --> 00:30:50,624
Chu song

686
00:30:51,265 --> 00:30:52,824
The outside world is very complicated.

687
00:30:53,225 --> 00:30:54,225
You must protect yourself.

688
00:30:54,544 --> 00:30:55,784
You asked me to open my heart.

689
00:30:55,784 --> 00:30:56,544
To make friends?

690
00:30:56,544 --> 00:30:57,304
to make friends

691
00:30:58,104 --> 00:30:59,104
You should keep your eyes sharp.

692
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:00,384
Right, Senior?

693
00:31:02,824 --> 00:31:03,304
Lu Xiao Bei,

694
00:31:03,705 --> 00:31:04,584
You're fine.

695
00:31:04,784 --> 00:31:05,505
It's okay. I'll escort you.

696
00:31:06,425 --> 00:31:07,505
I'm really fine today.

697
00:31:07,505 --> 00:31:08,945
Our team is off today.

698
00:31:09,064 --> 00:31:10,465
I'm going to watch a movie tonight.

699
00:31:10,705 --> 00:31:11,384
Are you free

700
00:31:12,064 --> 00:31:12,705
What a coincidence!

701
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:13,945
I was just talking to Chuge.

702
00:31:13,945 --> 00:31:15,344
About watching a movie tonight?

703
00:31:18,465 --> 00:31:18,985
Yes

704
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,584
Or

705
00:31:24,304 --> 00:31:25,265
We

706
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:26,544
Together.

707
00:31:26,864 --> 00:31:27,465
Alright.

708
00:31:27,945 --> 00:31:29,144
It's rare to come together.

709
00:31:29,344 --> 00:31:30,104
It's fate.

710
00:31:31,025 --> 00:31:32,784
If you find it inconvenient,

711
00:31:32,784 --> 00:31:33,505
convenient

712
00:31:34,584 --> 00:31:37,025
As the saying goes, three people must be my teachers.

713
00:31:37,265 --> 00:31:38,304
Then tonight,

714
00:31:39,104 --> 00:31:39,705
Be sure to wait!

715
00:31:40,185 --> 00:31:40,905
See you tonight.

716
00:31:40,905 --> 00:31:42,144
See what?

717
00:31:42,144 --> 00:31:43,985
Who goes out with a rival?

718
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,025
Your EQ and IQ

719
00:31:46,265 --> 00:31:46,784
Where are they?

720
00:31:46,784 --> 00:31:47,384
Namely

721
00:31:47,384 --> 00:31:49,185
You can eat your brain out of jealousy.

722
00:31:49,185 --> 00:31:50,225
How about I go with you?

723
00:31:50,225 --> 00:31:51,864
In this way, we won't suffer.

724
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:54,225
I think it's safer not to go.

725
00:31:54,505 --> 00:31:55,864
What a mess!

726
00:31:55,864 --> 00:31:57,104
Don't think too much.

727
00:31:57,104 --> 00:31:57,705
I

728
00:31:58,025 --> 00:32:00,064
I'm worried that Chu Ge will be deceived.

729
00:32:00,064 --> 00:32:01,425
I'm going to interview her.

730
00:32:01,505 --> 00:32:02,745
Can you stop acting?

731
00:32:02,745 --> 00:32:04,505
You're the worst at this.

732
00:32:04,985 --> 00:32:05,544
Really

733
00:32:05,544 --> 00:32:06,784
I have a hunch.

734
00:32:06,784 --> 00:32:08,104
Tonight's movie

735
00:32:08,104 --> 00:32:10,705
Will be a bloody storm.

736
00:32:12,144 --> 00:32:13,104
Not as a teammate.

737
00:32:13,104 --> 00:32:14,584
Can you have a little faith in me?

738
00:32:14,584 --> 00:32:15,465
To be honest, Xiao Bei,

739
00:32:15,465 --> 00:32:16,784
We wanted to make a bet just now.

740
00:32:16,945 --> 00:32:17,665
But I didn't gamble.

741
00:32:17,665 --> 00:32:19,144
Because no one is betting on you to win.

742
00:32:21,864 --> 00:32:22,985
Thank you.

743
00:32:31,465 --> 00:32:33,025
Thank you, Senior.

744
00:32:33,265 --> 00:32:33,905
don't mention it

745
00:32:34,265 --> 00:32:36,025
The Art Troupe will be your home.

746
00:32:36,025 --> 00:32:37,505
Just feel free to come.

747
00:32:41,064 --> 00:32:41,665
He's here.

748
00:32:42,064 --> 00:32:42,624
Sorry.

749
00:32:42,624 --> 00:32:43,905
The art troupe was late.

750
00:32:44,304 --> 00:32:44,945
Sorry.

751
00:32:45,225 --> 00:32:45,985
I forgot to buy yours.

752
00:32:48,064 --> 00:32:48,745
Sorry.

753
00:32:49,945 --> 00:32:51,225
Chuge has a fever.

754
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,104
You should drink more hot water.

755
00:32:53,624 --> 00:32:54,344
Drink plenty of hot water.

756
00:33:00,505 --> 00:33:01,425
The movie is about to begin.

757
00:33:01,544 --> 00:33:02,225
Let's go.

758
00:33:02,465 --> 00:33:03,025
good

759
00:33:03,745 --> 00:33:04,265
Correct!

760
00:33:04,425 --> 00:33:05,505
I've been to this theater before.

761
00:33:05,505 --> 00:33:07,104
Their air conditioning is very good.

762
00:33:07,384 --> 00:33:08,225
therefore

763
00:33:12,384 --> 00:33:13,104
I brought a coat.

764
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:14,905
I'll put it on for you.

765
00:33:15,344 --> 00:33:15,864
Thank you.

766
00:33:16,064 --> 00:33:16,544
don't mention it

767
00:33:20,544 --> 00:33:21,265
I'm fine.

768
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,784
Is it that exaggerated?

769
00:33:23,144 --> 00:33:24,344
The people of your sports university

770
00:33:24,624 --> 00:33:25,544
Are you so afraid of the cold?

771
00:33:39,344 --> 00:33:39,864
Xiaobei

772
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:40,985
It's okay.

773
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:43,025
I was touched.

774
00:33:44,425 --> 00:33:45,064
Or

775
00:33:45,265 --> 00:33:46,185
Have some hot water.

776
00:33:49,185 --> 00:33:50,025
It's so touching.

777
00:34:14,104 --> 00:34:15,624
I thought it was a comedy.

778
00:34:15,745 --> 00:34:17,064
I didn't expect the ending to be so sad.

779
00:34:17,225 --> 00:34:18,745
As Chaplin said,

780
00:34:18,745 --> 00:34:20,425
Life is a comedy.

781
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:21,584
It's a tragedy from a distance.

782
00:34:21,584 --> 00:34:23,384
But I don't like the male lead.

783
00:34:23,624 --> 00:34:24,985
You really like that girl.

784
00:34:24,985 --> 00:34:25,945
He didn't say anything.

785
00:34:26,185 --> 00:34:27,185
It's too hard to watch.

786
00:34:29,624 --> 00:34:30,344
It's choking.

787
00:34:31,304 --> 00:34:32,945
I think he's affectionate.

788
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:34,384
People are like this.

789
00:34:34,665 --> 00:34:36,384
The more I like it, the more scared I am.

790
00:34:37,104 --> 00:34:38,705
Even though you're usually careless,

791
00:34:39,185 --> 00:34:40,544
Will be cautious.

792
00:34:43,104 --> 00:34:43,985
By the way, Xiao Bei,

793
00:34:44,584 --> 00:34:46,225
My car can only seat two people.

794
00:34:52,104 --> 00:34:53,265
You two go back.

795
00:34:53,265 --> 00:34:53,784
Where is it cool?

796
00:34:53,784 --> 00:34:54,745
Where have I been?

797
00:34:55,064 --> 00:34:55,624
one's master's/teacher's son who is older than oneself

798
00:34:55,864 --> 00:34:56,824
Take Xiao Bei back.

799
00:34:56,945 --> 00:34:57,824
I'll run back myself.

800
00:34:58,784 --> 00:34:59,784
The song of Chu.

801
00:34:59,784 --> 00:35:00,225
Chu song

802
00:35:00,384 --> 00:35:01,185
Chu song

803
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:21,985
I heard from Chu Ge that

804
00:35:21,985 --> 00:35:23,505
You're a professional crossfire fighter.

805
00:35:25,985 --> 00:35:27,784
It's not as good as your key universities.

806
00:35:28,104 --> 00:35:28,985
Don't say that.

807
00:35:29,344 --> 00:35:31,025
Now e-sports is a popular career.

808
00:35:31,185 --> 00:35:33,025
I'm a cross-fire fan.

809
00:35:33,025 --> 00:35:34,025
For three or four years.

810
00:35:34,225 --> 00:35:34,745
Of course.

811
00:35:34,824 --> 00:35:36,064
Not as powerful as your profession.

812
00:35:36,344 --> 00:35:37,425
Don't be humble.

813
00:35:38,104 --> 00:35:39,265
When you're free,

814
00:35:40,344 --> 00:35:41,384
I'd better stop looking for abuse.

815
00:35:51,144 --> 00:35:52,304
Do you play the mysterious sea?

816
00:35:55,784 --> 00:35:56,905
Two and four are the most fun.

817
00:35:57,185 --> 00:35:58,185
Three is boring.

818
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,265
I'm also the favorite.

819
00:36:00,584 --> 00:36:01,864
Especially in the final.

820
00:36:02,864 --> 00:36:03,465
Look.

821
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,704
Drake and Elena.

822
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,345
After all you've been through,

823
00:36:06,345 --> 00:36:07,425
Finally back home.

824
00:36:08,264 --> 00:36:09,144
When I was watching it,

825
00:36:09,144 --> 00:36:10,744
I was so touched I almost cried.

826
00:36:10,905 --> 00:36:12,385
I don't feel like I'm playing a game.

827
00:36:12,505 --> 00:36:14,425
Seems to be a real friend.

828
00:36:14,425 --> 00:36:15,945
I'm really happy for them.

829
00:36:16,064 --> 00:36:16,544
Really

830
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,064
I saw the interview with Neil and Bruce.

831
00:36:21,704 --> 00:36:22,544
They said

832
00:36:22,624 --> 00:36:23,985
The character of the game.

833
00:36:23,985 --> 00:36:25,144
Just like real people.

834
00:36:25,624 --> 00:36:26,425
Will grow old.

835
00:36:26,905 --> 00:36:28,584
At different stages of life,

836
00:36:28,744 --> 00:36:30,425
Will have different ideas and ambitions.

837
00:36:30,905 --> 00:36:32,465
Will be the same as us.

838
00:36:32,825 --> 00:36:34,624
Sacrifice for the one you love.

839
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,224
That's right.

840
00:36:37,385 --> 00:36:38,624
The feeling of being real.

841
00:36:38,624 --> 00:36:40,184
Is the strongest in four.

842
00:36:41,224 --> 00:36:42,825
I think this is a video game.

843
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,305
Why it's so popular.

844
00:36:44,704 --> 00:36:45,184
What do you think?

845
00:36:52,624 --> 00:36:53,264
The light is green.

846
00:37:08,544 --> 00:37:08,985
to turn right

847
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:14,064
Why hasn't Xiao Bei come back?

848
00:37:14,064 --> 00:37:15,505
Why don't you call him?

849
00:37:15,584 --> 00:37:16,584
I've called him.

850
00:37:16,584 --> 00:37:17,465
He's not answering.

851
00:37:17,744 --> 00:37:18,544
If you hit him again,

852
00:37:20,465 --> 00:37:21,425
Call 110.

853
00:37:22,184 --> 00:37:23,505
I think I should call 120.

854
00:37:36,025 --> 00:37:36,945
Nice to meet you.

855
00:37:37,064 --> 00:37:37,865
I'm happy too.

856
00:37:38,025 --> 00:37:38,945
Why are you shaking hands?

857
00:37:38,945 --> 00:37:39,505
See you next time.

858
00:37:41,505 --> 00:37:42,905
They all hugged them.

859
00:37:42,905 --> 00:37:43,425
Then I'm leaving.

860
00:37:43,704 --> 00:37:44,825
What are they doing?

861
00:37:44,825 --> 00:37:45,184
bye-bye

862
00:37:45,184 --> 00:37:45,985
Be careful.

863
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,264
How about WeChat?

864
00:37:51,425 --> 00:37:52,465
It's killing me.

865
00:37:52,465 --> 00:37:53,144
What are they doing?

866
00:37:53,144 --> 00:37:54,025
They added WeChat messages, right?

867
00:37:58,184 --> 00:37:59,104
Okay, I'm leaving.

868
00:37:59,425 --> 00:38:00,264
Be careful on the way.

869
00:38:00,264 --> 00:38:00,785
Go.

870
00:38:01,025 --> 00:38:01,544
bye-bye

871
00:38:06,704 --> 00:38:07,345
What are you doing?

872
00:38:07,505 --> 00:38:08,305
Where is Chuge?

873
00:38:08,985 --> 00:38:10,025
She went back to school.

874
00:38:10,025 --> 00:38:11,905
What's going on, Lu Xiao Bei?

875
00:38:12,184 --> 00:38:13,425
Why did he send you back?

876
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:14,425
And hugged each other.

877
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:15,785
And added her WeChat.

878
00:38:15,785 --> 00:38:16,785
What did he lure you with?

879
00:38:16,785 --> 00:38:18,985
This guy is really nice.

880
00:38:19,584 --> 00:38:20,544
I really like him.

881
00:38:34,465 --> 00:38:36,544
Tomorrow is the last match of our group.

882
00:38:36,584 --> 00:38:38,144
The opponent will be eliminated.

883
00:38:38,144 --> 00:38:39,224
Allure Team.

884
00:38:39,465 --> 00:38:40,104
And beat them.

885
00:38:40,104 --> 00:38:41,584
We will be the first

886
00:38:41,584 --> 00:38:42,465
At the scene.

887
00:38:42,664 --> 00:38:43,184
but

888
00:38:43,184 --> 00:38:43,865
In the last eight,

889
00:38:43,865 --> 00:38:45,385
We will meet the Dragon Warriors.

890
00:38:45,385 --> 00:38:46,385
Dragon Warrior.

891
00:38:46,385 --> 00:38:47,224
Is that

892
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:48,985
Who are more powerful than King's Cross?

893
00:38:48,985 --> 00:38:50,584
He is the top seed.

894
00:38:50,905 --> 00:38:53,144
But if we lose tomorrow's game,

895
00:38:53,144 --> 00:38:55,064
The leader of the group is King of Kings.

896
00:38:55,184 --> 00:38:57,264
We will successfully avoid the Dragon Warriors.

897
00:38:57,664 --> 00:38:59,025
If so,

898
00:39:00,025 --> 00:39:02,385
We will meet in the eighth round.

899
00:39:02,825 --> 00:39:03,744
Fox Team

900
00:39:04,224 --> 00:39:05,505
The winning rate will be higher.

901
00:39:06,664 --> 00:39:08,624
For a favorable promotion way,

902
00:39:08,624 --> 00:39:09,744
To lose to the opponent on purpose.

903
00:39:10,064 --> 00:39:11,264
Isn't this a competition against counterfeits?

904
00:39:11,664 --> 00:39:13,505
It's called using the rules properly.

905
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,785
It's not a competition.

906
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:16,505
The purpose of the competition is to win.

907
00:39:16,785 --> 00:39:18,144
Losing on purpose is a fraud.

908
00:39:19,385 --> 00:39:20,025
Xiao Feng.

909
00:39:20,584 --> 00:39:22,224
Only the winner can stay.

910
00:39:22,425 --> 00:39:24,345
But the winner is the one who stays.

911
00:39:24,345 --> 00:39:26,544
Sometimes we need to use this reasonably.

912
00:39:26,544 --> 00:39:27,465
The rules of the game.

913
00:39:30,104 --> 00:39:31,425
I think

914
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,025
An Lan, Xu Wei has a point.

915
00:39:33,664 --> 00:39:35,425
Sacrifice you for a small competition.

916
00:39:35,425 --> 00:39:36,704
A favorable schedule.

917
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,704
It's worth it.

918
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:39,385
That's right.

919
00:39:39,664 --> 00:39:41,945
The whole city was shaved.

920
00:39:41,945 --> 00:39:43,704
To win a comfortable game tomorrow.

921
00:39:43,704 --> 00:39:45,184
To leave happily.

922
00:39:47,624 --> 00:39:49,305
It doesn't matter whether you win or lose.

923
00:39:49,425 --> 00:39:50,865
What matters is our attitude.

924
00:39:50,865 --> 00:39:52,785
If all the teams do what we do,

925
00:39:52,785 --> 00:39:54,584
Who wants to watch the crossfire competition?

926
00:39:54,584 --> 00:39:56,465
We can't do that.

927
00:39:59,305 --> 00:40:00,025
Xiao Feng.

928
00:40:01,064 --> 00:40:03,264
Can I talk to you alone?

929
00:40:03,544 --> 00:40:05,025
If you want to talk about the competition,

930
00:40:05,505 --> 00:40:05,985
Don't think about it.

931
00:40:12,264 --> 00:40:12,624
Lieutenant

932
00:40:12,825 --> 00:40:14,785
To buy some new equipment for you.

933
00:40:15,544 --> 00:40:16,505
I think it's falling apart.

934
00:40:16,704 --> 00:40:17,905
Where did you get so much money?

935
00:40:18,704 --> 00:40:20,144
It's in my pocket.

936
00:40:20,144 --> 00:40:21,064
And the one in my shoe.

937
00:40:21,264 --> 00:40:22,345
Everything I have is here.

938
00:40:22,744 --> 00:40:23,905
What should we do in the future?

939
00:40:23,905 --> 00:40:25,064
We can't make it.

940
00:40:25,104 --> 00:40:26,425
Let's finish what we're doing.

941
00:40:26,664 --> 00:40:27,624
We'll talk about it later.

942
00:40:42,264 --> 00:40:43,544
It's really hard to find you.

943
00:40:44,064 --> 00:40:44,945
We have something to do.

944
00:40:47,264 --> 00:40:48,544
You didn't answer my text.

945
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:49,865
Give me your phone number.

946
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:50,945
And made it dark for me.

947
00:40:51,104 --> 00:40:52,785
What do you want to do?

948
00:40:53,104 --> 00:40:54,385
Don't I give you the money?

949
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:55,544
We're done.

950
00:40:55,544 --> 00:40:56,785
Why is it okay?

951
00:40:57,144 --> 00:40:57,825
Xu Wei.

952
00:40:57,945 --> 00:40:59,945
What I've done for you is fatal.

953
00:41:00,465 --> 00:41:02,264
They wanted to get rid of me.

954
00:41:02,345 --> 00:41:03,704
You really treat me as a beggar?

955
00:41:04,305 --> 00:41:05,624
It's no use looking for me now.

956
00:41:05,624 --> 00:41:06,704
I have no money.

957
00:41:06,905 --> 00:41:07,744
No money, right?

958
00:41:08,104 --> 00:41:09,144
No money, I'm searching.

959
00:41:09,264 --> 00:41:10,465
What are you doing?

960
00:41:11,025 --> 00:41:11,624
I didn't.

961
00:41:11,624 --> 00:41:13,025
What is this?

962
00:41:13,025 --> 00:41:14,025
You can't touch this.

963
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:15,064
What is this?

964
00:41:15,425 --> 00:41:17,144
You can't touch the money of our team.

965
00:41:17,305 --> 00:41:18,664
The team's money is your money.

966
00:41:20,664 --> 00:41:21,704
What do you want?

967
00:41:23,744 --> 00:41:24,624
You said you had no money.

968
00:41:30,945 --> 00:41:32,584
I have no money to buy a watch.

969
00:41:32,584 --> 00:41:33,584
This watch can't be taken off.

970
00:41:33,584 --> 00:41:34,264
The watch can't be taken off.

971
00:41:34,345 --> 00:41:34,985
to step aside

972
00:41:37,985 --> 00:41:38,624
Alright.

973
00:41:38,905 --> 00:41:40,224
I'll find you after I finish.

974
00:41:40,704 --> 00:41:42,025
Don't keep me from finding it.

975
00:42:03,224 --> 00:42:04,544
I'll study a new tactic.

976
00:42:04,544 --> 00:42:05,704
We can have a try tomorrow.

977
00:42:06,505 --> 00:42:08,544
Alright. Whatever you want.

978
00:42:14,425 --> 00:42:15,945
Feng, let me tell you something.

979
00:42:16,104 --> 00:42:16,785
What's up

980
00:42:18,465 --> 00:42:20,664
I just fought with someone.

981
00:42:25,184 --> 00:42:25,945
to quarrel

982
00:42:26,505 --> 00:42:27,104
Who is it?

983
00:42:27,465 --> 00:42:28,305
Are they still there?

984
00:42:28,305 --> 00:42:28,704
go

985
00:42:28,704 --> 00:42:29,505
And ask them to explain.

986
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,985
She has left already.

987
00:42:31,184 --> 00:42:32,905
A group of people drank too much.

988
00:42:32,905 --> 00:42:33,905
I didn't mean to touch him.

989
00:42:33,905 --> 00:42:35,544
And then it was endless.

990
00:42:35,544 --> 00:42:36,664
And beat me up.

991
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:38,825
this

992
00:42:42,624 --> 00:42:43,345
Where is the table?

993
00:42:45,624 --> 00:42:46,664
I lost it just now.

994
00:42:48,664 --> 00:42:50,704
They even took the money from my equipment.

995
00:42:51,905 --> 00:42:53,184
And took the money.

996
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:54,465
Call the police

997
00:42:55,224 --> 00:42:56,664
Don't report it.

998
00:42:56,664 --> 00:42:58,425
Stealing money is illegal.

999
00:42:58,425 --> 00:42:59,025
You must report it.

1000
00:42:59,025 --> 00:42:59,505
No

1001
00:42:59,505 --> 00:43:00,945
It's nothing serious.

1002
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:02,785
We still need to make a statement.

1003
00:43:02,945 --> 00:43:03,945
We're about to play a game.

1004
00:43:03,945 --> 00:43:04,945
It's too late.

1005
00:43:04,945 --> 00:43:06,064
I broke some skins.

1006
00:43:06,064 --> 00:43:07,785
So I put up with it.

1007
00:43:10,264 --> 00:43:10,905
Alright.

1008
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:12,465
She's fine.

1009
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:15,345
Wash up.

1010
00:43:15,584 --> 00:43:16,985
I'll buy you some medicine.

1011
00:43:44,385 --> 00:43:45,744
Can I spare you two minutes?

1012
00:43:46,465 --> 00:43:47,825
You want to talk about the competition again?

1013
00:43:48,184 --> 00:43:49,264
It's not that.

1014
00:43:51,825 --> 00:43:52,544
Two minutes.

1015
00:43:52,744 --> 00:43:53,544
Time starts now.

1016
00:43:55,224 --> 00:43:57,144
I found you avoiding me.

1017
00:43:57,624 --> 00:43:58,224
No

1018
00:43:58,465 --> 00:44:00,305
Something's wrong. I can feel it.

1019
00:44:00,505 --> 00:44:01,425
You are being paranoid

1020
00:44:02,905 --> 00:44:03,785
The record I gave you.

1021
00:44:03,785 --> 00:44:04,584
Are you finished?

1022
00:44:04,825 --> 00:44:05,264
no

1023
00:44:06,064 --> 00:44:06,945
I don't understand a word.

1024
00:44:07,305 --> 00:44:09,025
You can ask me if you don't understand.

1025
00:44:09,704 --> 00:44:10,345
There's no time.

1026
00:44:12,624 --> 00:44:14,224
Xiao Feng, what did I do wrong?

1027
00:44:14,744 --> 00:44:16,905
You're the one who got a perfect score in math.

1028
00:44:17,224 --> 00:44:18,184
How could it be wrong?

1029
00:44:18,184 --> 00:44:18,744
Then why are you

1030
00:44:18,744 --> 00:44:20,345
To keep your distance from me?

1031
00:44:22,465 --> 00:44:23,184
No

1032
00:44:25,025 --> 00:44:26,425
Without result.

1033
00:44:27,624 --> 00:44:29,184
Let's stop wasting time.

1034
00:44:30,144 --> 00:44:31,305
What do you mean?

1035
00:44:32,184 --> 00:44:33,905
You and I...

1036
00:44:34,664 --> 00:44:35,704
There will be no result.

1037
00:44:36,104 --> 00:44:36,865
Got it?

1038
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:38,465
That hasn't started yet.

1039
00:44:38,465 --> 00:44:39,385
How do you know?

1040
00:44:40,584 --> 00:44:41,184
I can calculate.

1041
00:44:41,264 --> 00:44:42,985
You figured it out with your lucky coin?

1042
00:44:47,104 --> 00:44:47,825
There's no fate.

1043
00:44:47,825 --> 00:44:48,785
Don't force me.

1044
00:44:49,224 --> 00:44:50,425
It's good to be friends.

1045
00:44:54,064 --> 00:44:54,945
Two minutes is up.

1046
00:45:27,305 --> 00:45:28,465
Let's be together.

1047
00:45:38,425 --> 00:45:40,064
He always believed in this.

1048
00:45:43,905 --> 00:45:44,825
I don't know.

1049
00:45:45,345 --> 00:45:47,025
Is he confident or superstitious?

1050
00:45:47,425 --> 00:45:49,025
Actually, don't you think

1051
00:45:49,025 --> 00:45:50,305
The things we struggle with

1052
00:45:50,985 --> 00:45:52,505
Thinking about it now, it's childish.

1053
00:45:54,025 --> 00:45:55,505
If you like someone,

1054
00:45:55,624 --> 00:45:56,704
Will become silly.

1055
00:45:56,704 --> 00:45:57,544
Really?

1056
00:45:58,104 --> 00:45:59,425
Didn't you realize that I was

1057
00:45:59,425 --> 00:46:01,264
The IQ is getting worse?

1058
00:46:03,704 --> 00:46:05,305
I don't think you've changed a bit over the years.

1059
00:46:11,544 --> 00:46:13,385
The most precious part of people.

1060
00:46:13,744 --> 00:46:15,345
Are often unwilling to change.

1061
00:46:17,184 --> 00:46:17,825
AnLuan

1062
00:46:19,664 --> 00:46:20,865
Let's be together.
