1
00:02:42,653 --> 00:02:43,733
Is Lu Xiao Nan here?

2
00:02:44,653 --> 00:02:46,213
Brother,

3
00:02:47,412 --> 00:02:47,693
someone is looking for you.

4
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:49,333
Are you Lu Xiaobei?

5
00:02:49,772 --> 00:02:51,053
How do you know me?

6
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,412
It doesn't matter

7
00:02:53,412 --> 00:02:54,373
who you are or who I am.

8
00:02:54,373 --> 00:02:55,412
Someone asked me to give you a message,

9
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:57,172
telling you not to go to the game tonight.

10
00:02:57,172 --> 00:02:57,892
Why?

11
00:02:57,892 --> 00:02:58,812
Who asked you to say that to me?

12
00:02:58,812 --> 00:02:59,492
In two or three sentences,

13
00:02:59,492 --> 00:03:00,492
I can't explain it clearly.

14
00:03:00,492 --> 00:03:01,812
Just listen to me.

15
00:03:01,812 --> 00:03:03,492
It won't hurt if you don't go to the game.

16
00:03:03,492 --> 00:03:03,973
All right,

17
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,653
that's what you said.

18
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:06,172
Anything else?

19
00:03:06,172 --> 00:03:07,092
No, that's it.

20
00:03:07,293 --> 00:03:07,452
No,

21
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:08,733
that man told me over and over again,

22
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:10,053
You mustn't go to see it.

23
00:03:10,293 --> 00:03:11,092
Okay, I'm not going to see it.

24
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:11,693
I got it.

25
00:03:12,373 --> 00:03:13,693
It's not wrong for you to listen to me.

26
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,772
-I heard you. -Bye.

27
00:03:14,772 --> 00:03:15,293
Bye.

28
00:03:15,573 --> 00:03:17,373
Brother, he looks like a bad guy to me.

29
00:03:17,373 --> 00:03:18,772
Don't open the door for strangers in the future.

30
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,213
Are you sure you won't go?

31
00:03:21,213 --> 00:03:22,293
You have to listen to me. Do you hear me?

32
00:03:22,293 --> 00:03:22,812
Are you done?

33
00:03:22,812 --> 00:03:24,573
Don't go.

34
00:03:24,573 --> 00:03:25,892
Bad guy! Bad guy! Bad guy!

35
00:03:27,293 --> 00:03:28,213
Xiao Feng, come here.

36
00:03:28,213 --> 00:03:29,573
The game is about to start.

37
00:03:30,213 --> 00:03:31,653
I did it at point B.

38
00:03:34,653 --> 00:03:35,573
Xiao Feng, I'll cover you.

39
00:03:35,573 --> 00:03:35,933
Okay,

40
00:03:36,252 --> 00:03:36,892
Bai,

41
00:03:36,892 --> 00:03:37,612
you're here.

42
00:03:37,612 --> 00:03:38,252
Bai.

43
00:03:42,493 --> 00:03:43,573
Can't you even beat him to death?

44
00:03:44,493 --> 00:03:46,213
Your screen is so shaky Who can you hit?

45
00:03:46,413 --> 00:03:47,013
Be careful. Be careful.

46
00:03:47,013 --> 00:03:47,653
There's someone next to you.

47
00:03:47,653 --> 00:03:48,653
Do people on your left

48
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:49,933
know how to look at people?

49
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:51,133
Ming, cover Xiao Feng,

50
00:03:53,013 --> 00:03:54,133
Baisha, Baisha,

51
00:03:54,452 --> 00:03:55,972
What a waste of time!

52
00:03:57,092 --> 00:03:58,532
Why did you come here?

53
00:03:58,532 --> 00:03:59,172
I have a chance.

54
00:04:05,452 --> 00:04:06,013
I'll go.

55
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:07,413
He's even worse than my grandma.

56
00:04:08,532 --> 00:04:09,452
It depends on you.

57
00:04:09,452 --> 00:04:11,612
I'm sorry, guys. My hands are too cold today.

58
00:04:11,972 --> 00:04:12,612
It's not your fault.

59
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:14,013
You don't often use snipers.

60
00:04:14,532 --> 00:04:15,092
Brother Feng,

61
00:04:15,252 --> 00:04:15,972
what should we do?

62
00:04:15,972 --> 00:04:17,452
If it goes on like this, I'm going to die today.

63
00:04:22,413 --> 00:04:23,092
Sha,

64
00:04:23,092 --> 00:04:23,933
can you fight?

65
00:04:25,652 --> 00:04:26,172
Me,

66
00:04:27,932 --> 00:04:29,093
I know nothing.

67
00:04:29,413 --> 00:04:29,813
Stand up.

68
00:04:30,573 --> 00:04:31,533
Stay away from the internet,

69
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:32,533
reject the temptation,

70
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:33,492
Thank your parents.

71
00:04:33,492 --> 00:04:34,492
Reshape your life,

72
00:04:34,492 --> 00:04:35,093
be grateful,

73
00:04:35,093 --> 00:04:36,973
Stop! Stop!

74
00:04:37,492 --> 00:04:38,452
There is only one Divine Sniper.

75
00:04:40,253 --> 00:04:41,533
Chang Sha, change to

76
00:04:43,013 --> 00:04:43,813
Shark. Come on.

77
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:45,973
Try it.

78
00:04:46,973 --> 00:04:47,573
I'm just kidding.

79
00:04:47,813 --> 00:04:50,013
Sha's sniper is more accurate than mine.

80
00:04:50,253 --> 00:04:51,293
That was before.

81
00:04:51,293 --> 00:04:52,413
What should we do then?

82
00:04:52,413 --> 00:04:53,332
Let's take a chance.

83
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:54,172
Sha,

84
00:04:55,372 --> 00:04:56,693
you'll be responsible for killing the snipers on the other side later.

85
00:04:58,013 --> 00:04:59,612
He seems to be running fast.

86
00:04:59,612 --> 00:05:00,492
He's a good shot,

87
00:05:00,492 --> 00:05:01,932
but every time he goes through the middle gate,

88
00:05:01,932 --> 00:05:02,973
There are loopholes in the search.

89
00:05:02,973 --> 00:05:04,133
I can give it a try.

90
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:05,372
I was talking about you.

91
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:06,652
Look,

92
00:05:08,693 --> 00:05:09,212
Come on,

93
00:05:09,573 --> 00:05:10,093
Come on!

94
00:05:10,492 --> 00:05:11,212
Come on!

95
00:05:13,892 --> 00:05:14,813
What's wrong, Sha?

96
00:05:15,573 --> 00:05:16,253
Is there a problem?

97
00:05:18,573 --> 00:05:20,133
Can I have a bottle of iced cola?

98
00:05:22,212 --> 00:05:23,093
Boss,

99
00:05:23,093 --> 00:05:24,052
a bottle of iced cola,

100
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:24,932
I'll get it.

101
00:05:28,772 --> 00:05:29,413
Thank you.

102
00:05:29,772 --> 00:05:30,293
I'm fine.

103
00:05:48,892 --> 00:05:49,973
Brother Feng, take a look at it for me.

104
00:05:49,973 --> 00:05:50,573
I took aim to cover

105
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:53,052
for Xiao Feng.

106
00:05:59,172 --> 00:06:00,573
He's heading for A.

107
00:06:02,093 --> 00:06:02,772
Chief Commandant.

108
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:09,052
Go, go,

109
00:06:09,052 --> 00:06:09,492
go, go.

110
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,652
Sha can't see anyone else.

111
00:06:13,652 --> 00:06:14,372
Get out of the way

112
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:17,413
when you're here!

113
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:03,773
Sha,

114
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:04,572
Cool.

115
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:17,413
You're welcome.

116
00:07:30,252 --> 00:07:30,973
Sha,

117
00:07:30,973 --> 00:07:32,012
don't come near me.

118
00:07:32,012 --> 00:07:32,572
Sha, stay away.

119
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:35,213
Sha,

120
00:07:35,213 --> 00:07:36,132
don't come near me!

121
00:07:37,973 --> 00:07:39,533
Don't pull me.

122
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:00,572
Nice.

123
00:08:01,653 --> 00:08:02,333
Sha,

124
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:05,213
thank you so much.

125
00:08:06,413 --> 00:08:07,893
I'm telling you, from now on,

126
00:08:07,893 --> 00:08:08,572
I'll take care of your iced cola.

127
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,132
I should thank you.

128
00:08:10,132 --> 00:08:12,012
Thank you for taking me in.

129
00:08:12,012 --> 00:08:13,893
My parents call me a loser.

130
00:08:15,012 --> 00:08:15,973
To be honest,

131
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:16,773
when I got him back,

132
00:08:16,773 --> 00:08:17,893
I thought he was a brick,

133
00:08:17,893 --> 00:08:19,132
but I didn't expect him to be a piece of gold.

134
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:20,132
Or pure gold?

135
00:08:21,612 --> 00:08:21,853
Come on,

136
00:08:22,692 --> 00:08:23,533
Welcome to the team.

137
00:08:24,893 --> 00:08:25,893
To join your team,

138
00:08:25,893 --> 00:08:27,012
I have one condition,

139
00:08:27,012 --> 00:08:27,773
What condition?

140
00:08:28,213 --> 00:08:29,413
I want to change my name.

141
00:08:29,413 --> 00:08:30,653
Change to another account.

142
00:08:30,653 --> 00:08:32,893
His current name is Old S, Old S,

143
00:08:32,893 --> 00:08:33,812
It's so unlucky.

144
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:34,932
Death of old age, death of old age,

145
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:37,812
death of old age,

146
00:08:37,812 --> 00:08:38,893
What do you want to change?

147
00:08:39,093 --> 00:08:40,653
Did you just call me gold?

148
00:08:40,973 --> 00:08:42,973
I also want to be the gold of your Steel Team,

149
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:46,093
or I'll call it 24K.

150
00:08:47,252 --> 00:08:48,333
In 2008,

151
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,132
he was the first national champion in the Cross Fire Challenge,

152
00:08:51,132 --> 00:08:53,453
Captain and Sniper of Steel Team Seven,

153
00:08:53,453 --> 00:08:55,333
Breakthrough DW Breakthrough Aming.

154
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:58,252
Breakthrough hand 7lin, 24k after break.

155
00:08:59,093 --> 00:08:59,893
Wait.

156
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:02,132
Who is 24K?

157
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,333
If you're not satisfied

158
00:09:03,413 --> 00:09:05,252
that I don't know you,

159
00:09:05,252 --> 00:09:06,252
I can change it too.

160
00:09:06,252 --> 00:09:07,012
I … I

161
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:08,132
… I … My name is Diamond.

162
00:09:08,653 --> 00:09:10,093
No, no, no. Your name is 24K.

163
00:09:10,812 --> 00:09:11,692
You can't change it.

164
00:09:11,893 --> 00:09:13,093
You can't change it for the rest of your life.

165
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,012
Are you okay?

166
00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:17,572
My name is 24K.

167
00:09:17,572 --> 00:09:18,252
It's okay,

168
00:09:18,653 --> 00:09:20,572
I'm so happy to have you around.

169
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,533
Let me interrupt,

170
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:26,653
our semi-final opponent is a double-take-out team,

171
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:27,973
I'll stay here tonight.

172
00:09:27,973 --> 00:09:28,653
The game starts at 8: 00, so we have to get it before

173
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:30,572
7: 30.

174
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:31,773
Beat them.

175
00:09:31,773 --> 00:09:33,612
Then we will compete with Dragon Sky Team

176
00:09:33,612 --> 00:09:34,733
for the competition area championship.

177
00:09:34,893 --> 00:09:36,653
The Dragon Sky Team is very strong,

178
00:09:36,653 --> 00:09:38,012
and their captain, Lu Xiaonan,

179
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:38,893
is a very accurate sniper,

180
00:09:41,453 --> 00:09:42,692
What do you think their captain's name is?

181
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:44,052
Lu Xiao Nan,

182
00:09:44,893 --> 00:09:46,372
find a boy named Lu Xiao Nan.

183
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:47,692
You must stop him from going to see it.

184
00:09:47,692 --> 00:09:48,812
The cross-fire race

185
00:09:48,812 --> 00:09:49,692
on November 22nd,

186
00:09:50,012 --> 00:09:51,893
Why did you stop your brother from going to the game?

187
00:09:52,132 --> 00:09:53,213
Because on the way to the game,

188
00:09:53,372 --> 00:09:54,932
he would die in a car accident.

189
00:09:54,932 --> 00:09:55,413
Lu Xiao Nan,

190
00:09:55,413 --> 00:09:56,213
please.

191
00:09:56,213 --> 00:09:56,853
You must go.

192
00:09:57,773 --> 00:09:58,572
Xiao Feng,

193
00:09:58,572 --> 00:09:59,012
where are you going?

194
00:09:59,012 --> 00:10:00,413
Aren't we going to have lunch together?

195
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:01,093
I'm not eating.

196
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:02,973
You're still playing a game tonight?

197
00:10:24,572 --> 00:10:25,252
Lu Xiao Nan

198
00:10:26,213 --> 00:10:27,213
Lu Xiao Nan

199
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,893
Lu Xiao Nan,

200
00:10:33,453 --> 00:10:34,453
Wait a minute.

201
00:10:48,012 --> 00:10:48,933
Brother, are you done?

202
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:49,853
You've been following me all day.

203
00:10:49,853 --> 00:10:50,853
What do you want?

204
00:10:51,412 --> 00:10:52,693
I'm here to save you.

205
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,012
Do I need you to save me?

206
00:10:54,012 --> 00:10:54,853
Just because you're fine now

207
00:10:54,853 --> 00:10:56,573
doesn't mean you're fine tonight.

208
00:10:56,853 --> 00:10:57,652
Liar Brother,

209
00:10:58,173 --> 00:10:58,853
you're lying like this,

210
00:10:58,853 --> 00:10:59,573
I've seen too many of them.

211
00:10:59,573 --> 00:11:00,492
If you want to lie,

212
00:11:00,492 --> 00:11:01,252
how many more can you change?

213
00:11:01,492 --> 00:11:02,813
Don't hang yourself on my tree.

214
00:11:02,813 --> 00:11:03,173
Okay?

215
00:11:06,973 --> 00:11:07,733
What are you doing?

216
00:11:08,053 --> 00:11:09,933
Maybe you think I'm talking nonsense,

217
00:11:09,933 --> 00:11:11,853
but everything I said next is true.

218
00:11:11,853 --> 00:11:12,892
I swear to God.

219
00:11:14,532 --> 00:11:15,053
Tell me,

220
00:11:15,693 --> 00:11:16,573
If you insist on

221
00:11:16,573 --> 00:11:18,532
going to the game tonight,

222
00:11:18,532 --> 00:11:19,412
You'll be killed by a car.

223
00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:22,012
If you threaten me,

224
00:11:22,012 --> 00:11:23,333
why would I threaten you?

225
00:11:23,652 --> 00:11:24,733
I did it to help you.

226
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:25,892
I'll help you get away with this.

227
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:26,892
Thank you

228
00:11:26,892 --> 00:11:28,173
for your kindness.

229
00:11:28,173 --> 00:11:29,652
But I don't believe a word you said.

230
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,892
Is your brother Lu Xiaobei?

231
00:11:40,772 --> 00:11:41,693
What do you want?

232
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:44,532
When I was playing Cross Fire,

233
00:11:44,892 --> 00:11:45,652
a boy told me,

234
00:11:45,652 --> 00:11:46,612
His name is Lu Xiaobei.

235
00:11:46,612 --> 00:11:47,012
He told me,

236
00:11:47,012 --> 00:11:48,173
He came from 2019,

237
00:11:48,173 --> 00:11:49,492
11 years later,

238
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:50,012
He told me that

239
00:11:50,012 --> 00:11:50,412
tonight,

240
00:11:50,412 --> 00:11:51,252
If you go to the game,

241
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,412
you'll get into a car accident.

242
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:53,532
He asked me to save you.

243
00:11:53,892 --> 00:11:54,733
You should go to the hospital.

244
00:11:56,492 --> 00:11:58,292
So what if you don't watch one more game?

245
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:00,532
What if it's true?

246
00:12:00,532 --> 00:12:01,532
Then you'll be gone.

247
00:12:01,532 --> 00:12:02,652
You're gone.

248
00:12:02,652 --> 00:12:03,492
Do you know how to talk?

249
00:12:05,813 --> 00:12:06,733
Are you done?

250
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:08,173
Who is it that insists on pestering me and not letting you go?

251
00:12:08,532 --> 00:12:09,892
I'm also in Cross Fire.

252
00:12:09,892 --> 00:12:10,772
My name is Xiao Fenggang,

253
00:12:11,652 --> 00:12:12,573
the captain of the supervision team.

254
00:12:14,012 --> 00:12:14,532
I know why

255
00:12:14,532 --> 00:12:15,412
you didn't let me go to the game.

256
00:12:15,412 --> 00:12:16,933
This has nothing to do with the competition.

257
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:17,933
It doesn't matter.

258
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:19,652
The important thing is that you can't go to the game.

259
00:12:19,652 --> 00:12:20,933
I can't let you die.

260
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:22,853
Lu Xiaobei has repeatedly told me not to let you go,

261
00:12:22,853 --> 00:12:24,252
but I won't let you go today.

262
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:26,053
Did Lu Xiaobei

263
00:12:26,853 --> 00:12:27,612
tell my brother to do that?

264
00:12:28,772 --> 00:12:29,252
Really?

265
00:12:30,012 --> 00:12:30,933
You're crazy.

266
00:12:45,053 --> 00:12:46,252
Pick it up,

267
00:12:46,252 --> 00:12:47,213
Lu Xiaobei. You,

268
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:48,053
Answer it.

269
00:12:48,053 --> 00:12:49,132
Answer it.

270
00:12:56,492 --> 00:12:58,012
How is Xiao Feng?

271
00:12:58,012 --> 00:12:59,372
Bei is in trouble.

272
00:12:59,372 --> 00:13:00,252
I told him about

273
00:13:00,252 --> 00:13:00,892
our time-travel call.

274
00:13:00,892 --> 00:13:01,933
He just doesn't believe me.

275
00:13:02,412 --> 00:13:02,892
I can't help it.

276
00:13:02,892 --> 00:13:03,412
If you put it on me,

277
00:13:03,412 --> 00:13:04,372
I won't believe it either.

278
00:13:04,372 --> 00:13:05,933
How about this? Tell me

279
00:13:05,933 --> 00:13:07,012
how did you get into the car accident?

280
00:13:07,012 --> 00:13:08,053
Who hit you?

281
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:09,012
I can't stop your brother.

282
00:13:09,012 --> 00:13:10,173
I'm going to stop your car.

283
00:13:10,612 --> 00:13:11,532
The driver escaped.

284
00:13:11,532 --> 00:13:12,532
We haven't caught him yet.

285
00:13:12,532 --> 00:13:13,693
Then tell me all the details of the accident.

286
00:13:13,892 --> 00:13:15,012
I'll think of other ways.

287
00:13:15,012 --> 00:13:15,973
At that time, my brother was riding a motorcycle,

288
00:13:15,973 --> 00:13:17,412
and he took me to the game.

289
00:13:17,652 --> 00:13:19,772
When we got to the middle of Nanshan Road,

290
00:13:19,772 --> 00:13:20,532
there was a car crossing the line,

291
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:21,573
It just drove us away.

292
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:23,012
My brother

293
00:13:23,652 --> 00:13:24,412
It was gone on the spot.

294
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:26,412
When did the accident happen?

295
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:27,532
Around 7: 20. Okay, I got

296
00:13:27,652 --> 00:13:28,652
it.

297
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:29,532
Xiao Feng,

298
00:13:30,012 --> 00:13:30,892
no matter what method you use,

299
00:13:30,892 --> 00:13:31,772
You must stop my brother.

300
00:13:31,772 --> 00:13:32,772
I'm begging you.

301
00:13:32,772 --> 00:13:33,652
Please, Xiao Feng,

302
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:35,053
don't worry,

303
00:13:35,053 --> 00:13:35,892
If it really doesn't work,

304
00:13:35,892 --> 00:13:37,053
I'll stop him at your door.

305
00:13:37,053 --> 00:13:38,012
Even if I give up my life,

306
00:13:38,012 --> 00:13:38,933
I won't let him go out.

307
00:13:53,652 --> 00:13:55,053
Raise your hand.

308
00:13:57,733 --> 00:13:58,412
Lower your voice.

309
00:13:58,412 --> 00:13:59,733
Where's the maintenance of your brother's car?

310
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:00,733
You lied to me!

311
00:14:00,733 --> 00:14:01,853
You're such a bad guy!

312
00:14:03,772 --> 00:14:04,772
Look carefully.

313
00:14:04,772 --> 00:14:06,532
Is a bad guy as handsome as me?

314
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:17,933
Do you like candies?

315
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:20,173
Yes, I do.

316
00:14:24,173 --> 00:14:24,813
Go and have fun.

317
00:14:38,012 --> 00:14:39,012
Brother,

318
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:40,652
Someone stole our motorcycle.

319
00:14:40,652 --> 00:14:41,733
Kid,

320
00:14:41,733 --> 00:14:42,532
who stole our motorcycle?

321
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,252
When did the accident happen?

322
00:15:02,132 --> 00:15:03,132
Around 7: 20 PM.

323
00:15:12,173 --> 00:15:13,053
I can't stop your brother.

324
00:15:13,053 --> 00:15:14,372
I'm going to stop your car.

325
00:15:14,652 --> 00:15:15,652
The driver escaped.

326
00:15:15,652 --> 00:15:16,853
We haven't caught him yet.

327
00:15:16,853 --> 00:15:18,412
Then tell me all the details of the accident.

328
00:15:18,412 --> 00:15:19,333
I'll think of other ways.

329
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:21,292
At that time, my brother was riding a motorcycle

330
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:22,252
and carrying me to the game.

331
00:15:22,252 --> 00:15:24,372
When we got to the middle of Nanshan Road,

332
00:15:24,453 --> 00:15:25,213
there was a car crossing the line,

333
00:15:25,213 --> 00:15:26,252
It just drove us away.

334
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:29,252
This is the middle section of Nanshan Road

335
00:15:29,252 --> 00:15:30,173
that Bei mentioned, right?

336
00:17:54,853 --> 00:17:55,892
Brother, where are you going?

337
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:56,733
What's wrong?

338
00:17:57,132 --> 00:17:57,933
I'm going to watch the game.

339
00:17:57,933 --> 00:17:58,612
The winner today

340
00:17:58,612 --> 00:18:00,053
will be our opponent in the next competition.

341
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:02,733
Brother, take me with you.

342
00:18:03,933 --> 00:18:04,573
What do you want to do?

343
00:18:04,573 --> 00:18:05,933
I want to watch the game, too.

344
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:06,933
I'll finish my homework.

345
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:08,132
I'll finish it when I'm back.

346
00:18:08,372 --> 00:18:09,453
No, it's too late.

347
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:11,292
Brother, I'm begging you.

348
00:18:11,292 --> 00:18:12,933
No, no, no.

349
00:18:13,652 --> 00:18:14,292
If you didn't do your homework,

350
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:15,492
would you take me to the game with you?

351
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:16,053
Be good,

352
00:18:16,213 --> 00:18:16,652
Brother,

353
00:18:16,652 --> 00:18:17,693
I'm angry. No.

354
00:18:17,693 --> 00:18:19,132
Please,

355
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:20,333
Brother,

356
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,333
Be good.

357
00:18:21,772 --> 00:18:22,333
I'll get going then.

358
00:18:22,892 --> 00:18:23,733
-Let's go. -Bye.

359
00:18:59,532 --> 00:19:00,372
Brother

360
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,213
Can you take me to the game with you?

361
00:19:03,453 --> 00:19:04,333
Okay,

362
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,252
but you have to promise me,

363
00:19:05,252 --> 00:19:06,372
Come back and finish your homework.

364
00:19:06,372 --> 00:19:06,973
Yes

365
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:11,772
You can go to the game now.

366
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:54,052
There's only one minute left.

367
00:20:33,492 --> 00:20:35,012
Brother, what's going on?

368
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,092
Let's go from Tianbei Road,

369
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:38,373
Xiaobei,

370
00:20:38,373 --> 00:20:39,453
Turn around and we'll be there soon.

371
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,373
Is it an emergency center?

372
00:23:32,092 --> 00:23:33,973
There was a car accident on Tianbei Road.

373
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:35,413
Two boys were hit by a car.

374
00:24:39,252 --> 00:24:40,693
Hurry. His heart is beating and his pulse is beating.

375
00:24:41,133 --> 00:24:42,252
Take this to the car first.

376
00:25:42,413 --> 00:25:45,052
There was a serious car accident on Nanshan Road.

377
00:25:45,173 --> 00:25:46,332
One person died

378
00:25:46,332 --> 00:25:47,213
and one person was seriously injured,

379
00:25:47,653 --> 00:25:48,413
The accident car.

380
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:49,133
The vehicle escaped,

381
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:49,613
Run,

382
00:25:49,693 --> 00:25:50,052
Nanshan Road,

383
00:25:51,492 --> 00:25:51,812
Yes

384
00:25:53,532 --> 00:25:54,413
Tianbei Road,

385
00:25:54,852 --> 00:25:55,252
Run

386
00:25:55,373 --> 00:25:56,012
Tianbei Road,

387
00:25:56,252 --> 00:25:57,092
a serious car accident

388
00:25:57,092 --> 00:25:58,893
happened on Tianbei Road.

389
00:25:58,893 --> 00:26:01,133
The injured are being rescued in the hospital.

390
00:26:01,133 --> 00:26:02,532
A hit-and-run vehicle.

391
00:26:02,532 --> 00:26:04,492
The police are looking for witnesses.

392
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,173
Dad,

393
00:26:59,012 --> 00:26:59,653
Come on,

394
00:26:59,812 --> 00:27:01,292
Fold this later.

395
00:27:01,292 --> 00:27:02,052
Tell your mom,

396
00:27:02,252 --> 00:27:03,653
I'm working overtime tonight.

397
00:27:03,653 --> 00:27:04,772
I'm not coming back for dinner.

398
00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:08,453
What did you want to tell me just now?

399
00:27:08,453 --> 00:27:09,613
I have an appointment with my teammates tonight.

400
00:27:09,613 --> 00:27:11,173
To watch another semi-final match.

401
00:27:13,413 --> 00:27:15,252
It might rain heavily tonight.

402
00:27:15,532 --> 00:27:16,812
Don't go out. It's too dangerous.

403
00:27:17,173 --> 00:27:18,572
Stay at home with my brother.

404
00:27:18,572 --> 00:27:20,012
Help him review his lessons.

405
00:27:20,012 --> 00:27:20,532
But that game,

406
00:27:20,532 --> 00:27:21,092
okay,

407
00:27:21,532 --> 00:27:22,092
Captain,

408
00:27:24,933 --> 00:27:25,613
let's go.

409
00:27:35,532 --> 00:27:36,052
Hey,

410
00:27:36,413 --> 00:27:37,012
Hello,

411
00:27:37,332 --> 00:27:38,852
I'm from Nanshan Police Station,

412
00:27:39,332 --> 00:27:40,052
Lu Tianming,

413
00:27:40,373 --> 00:27:41,572
could you please

414
00:27:41,572 --> 00:27:43,213
ask the leader for instructions?

415
00:27:43,213 --> 00:27:44,453
You caught a man named Chu Donghai,

416
00:27:44,453 --> 00:27:45,693
whose daughter is with me.

417
00:27:45,893 --> 00:27:48,413
Can you arrange for them to meet?

418
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:49,532
It's her dad.

419
00:27:51,772 --> 00:27:53,173
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

420
00:27:55,693 --> 00:27:56,292
Captain Lu,

421
00:27:56,613 --> 00:27:57,292
how's it going?

422
00:28:00,092 --> 00:28:01,453
The little girl's father is dead.

423
00:28:13,332 --> 00:28:13,812
Uncle,

424
00:28:13,812 --> 00:28:16,092
can you take me to see my dad?

425
00:28:20,292 --> 00:28:21,373
Uncle, think of a way.

426
00:28:25,812 --> 00:28:27,133
The rain is so heavy.

427
00:28:27,133 --> 00:28:28,852
There was an accident on Tianbei Road.

428
00:28:28,852 --> 00:28:30,213
Two boys got hit while riding a motorcycle.

429
00:28:31,012 --> 00:28:33,052
Xing from the Traffic Police is on his way there.

430
00:28:35,252 --> 00:28:36,613
What did you just say?

431
00:28:36,893 --> 00:28:38,012
How old are

432
00:28:38,572 --> 00:28:39,693
the two children?

433
00:28:40,133 --> 00:28:41,413
It doesn't seem to be very big.

434
00:28:45,413 --> 00:28:46,453
Keep an eye on the route team

435
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:04,332
for me,

436
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,413
Let me tell you something,

437
00:29:05,893 --> 00:29:07,213
Li said at the scene just now,

438
00:29:07,973 --> 00:29:09,252
It was two boys who had an accident,

439
00:29:09,973 --> 00:29:10,613
as if,

440
00:29:11,373 --> 00:29:12,693
He seems to be your son.

441
00:29:13,332 --> 00:29:14,693
He has been sent to the hospital for emergency treatment.

442
00:31:37,373 --> 00:31:38,092
What do you think?

443
00:31:57,532 --> 00:31:57,973
Chief Commandant.

444
00:31:59,693 --> 00:32:00,852
Did you find Xiao Feng?

445
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,012
You just don't answer the phone.

446
00:32:03,012 --> 00:32:04,052
What's going on?

447
00:32:04,052 --> 00:32:05,772
You didn't show up for such an important game.

448
00:32:07,012 --> 00:32:07,453
It's too late.

449
00:32:07,453 --> 00:32:08,812
Let's find someone to fight for Xiao Feng.

450
00:32:08,812 --> 00:32:10,812
Why don't you call Shark?

451
00:32:10,812 --> 00:32:11,492
Forget it.

452
00:32:11,492 --> 00:32:12,052
With what he did,

453
00:32:12,052 --> 00:32:13,133
he couldn't do it at all.

454
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:14,092
You do this first.

455
00:32:14,572 --> 00:32:15,653
Gather all the people together first.

456
00:32:16,173 --> 00:32:17,532
We have to win today's competition.

457
00:32:17,532 --> 00:32:18,133
Get on the machine.

458
00:32:18,453 --> 00:32:18,812
Hurry up.

459
00:32:24,893 --> 00:32:25,973
Check it.

460
00:32:26,092 --> 00:32:28,173
Adjust the mouse and keyboard by yourself.

461
00:32:32,893 --> 00:32:33,933
I'll get White Shark here.

462
00:32:50,453 --> 00:32:50,973
I'm going for A.

463
00:32:52,453 --> 00:32:53,812
Okay, I'll cover you from behind.

464
00:32:53,812 --> 00:32:54,693
Lao Sha,

465
00:32:54,693 --> 00:32:55,252
tell me something.

466
00:32:57,052 --> 00:32:58,133
The middle is going to the right.

467
00:32:58,133 --> 00:32:58,973
Chief Commandant, I'll rush in front of you.

468
00:32:58,973 --> 00:32:59,893
Keep guarding point A. Keep guarding.

469
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:02,052
Shark, go!

470
00:33:02,052 --> 00:33:02,812
A Da You,

471
00:33:04,572 --> 00:33:05,213
kill one.

472
00:33:05,572 --> 00:33:06,012
Nice

473
00:33:06,012 --> 00:33:07,052
Shark is coming

474
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:08,012
with me.

475
00:33:08,012 --> 00:33:08,492
Go,

476
00:33:10,733 --> 00:33:11,492
Cover me!

477
00:33:11,653 --> 00:33:12,572
-I see it. -It's

478
00:33:14,133 --> 00:33:14,772
beautiful.

479
00:33:18,133 --> 00:33:18,613
Awesome,

480
00:33:21,213 --> 00:33:22,092
Nice.

481
00:33:23,252 --> 00:33:23,973
Hold on, hold on.

482
00:33:26,332 --> 00:33:27,213
There are two on the trail,

483
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,413
A-Ming Qilin and I go to A-University

484
00:33:28,413 --> 00:33:29,173
There are three

485
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:29,893
Lao Sha Lao Sha,

486
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:30,453
Shoot him.

487
00:33:30,733 --> 00:33:31,893
Kill one. Kill one.

488
00:33:32,933 --> 00:33:33,772
One in the middle.

489
00:33:33,772 --> 00:33:34,453
Cover me!

490
00:35:56,852 --> 00:35:58,453
Sorry for the traffic jam.

491
00:35:59,012 --> 00:36:00,373
I just called Bei,

492
00:36:00,373 --> 00:36:01,693
and he said he couldn't make it today.

493
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:02,373
Let's practice on our own.

494
00:36:04,173 --> 00:36:05,693
I worked so hard to train here,

495
00:36:05,693 --> 00:36:07,092
but he said he wouldn't come.

496
00:36:07,092 --> 00:36:08,413
What kind of team is this?

497
00:36:08,413 --> 00:36:10,933
Besides, we've lost three games in a row.

498
00:36:10,933 --> 00:36:11,572
If we lose again,

499
00:36:11,572 --> 00:36:13,173
we'll all pack up and leave.

500
00:36:13,653 --> 00:36:14,413
Where did he go?

501
00:36:15,252 --> 00:36:16,653
Today is the anniversary of his brother's death.

502
00:36:53,173 --> 00:36:53,613
Hurry up!

503
00:36:55,013 --> 00:36:56,133
Run! I'll cover you.

504
00:36:59,412 --> 00:37:01,133
I want to be taller than my brother.

505
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:09,533
You can go to the game now.

506
00:37:44,133 --> 00:37:45,573
Hurry. His heart is beating and his pulse is beating.

507
00:37:45,932 --> 00:37:47,093
Take this to the car first.
