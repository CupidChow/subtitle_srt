1
00:02:34,903 --> 00:02:35,743
Xiaobei

2
00:02:35,972 --> 00:02:37,253
What are you doing here so late?

3
00:02:37,253 --> 00:02:38,253
Why don't you turn on the light?

4
00:02:39,573 --> 00:02:41,093
Mom, where did you get this?

5
00:02:44,172 --> 00:02:45,813
On the refrigerator.

6
00:02:45,813 --> 00:02:47,493
Has been on the fridge for more than ten years.

7
00:02:47,692 --> 00:02:48,452
You forgot?

8
00:02:48,452 --> 00:02:49,493
You told me that

9
00:02:49,493 --> 00:02:51,452
This is your first postcard.

10
00:02:51,452 --> 00:02:53,772
I almost lost it when I cleaned the room once.

11
00:02:53,772 --> 00:02:55,052
And you cried all the time.

12
00:02:58,813 --> 00:02:59,412
Yes

13
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:03,452
Xiao Feng said that

14
00:03:05,173 --> 00:03:05,972
During the Mid-Autumn Festival,

15
00:03:05,972 --> 00:03:06,972
He received the moon cakes.

16
00:03:08,613 --> 00:03:09,652
What kind of moon cake?

17
00:03:11,813 --> 00:03:12,493
Brother

18
00:03:21,573 --> 00:03:22,252
Brother

19
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:24,172
Dad, the company has given out moon cakes.

20
00:03:24,172 --> 00:03:24,973
It's stuffed with dates.

21
00:03:28,493 --> 00:03:29,012
good

22
00:03:29,012 --> 00:03:29,612
Be careful

23
00:03:29,612 --> 00:03:30,252
Stay away from the enemy.

24
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,092
Brother, what does this mean?

25
00:03:33,532 --> 00:03:34,372
The middle one?

26
00:03:34,612 --> 00:03:36,053
Continue.

27
00:03:36,213 --> 00:03:37,732
Brother, let's have another round.

28
00:03:37,732 --> 00:03:39,133
We need to muster the courage

29
00:04:08,892 --> 00:04:09,452
Brother

30
00:04:09,973 --> 00:04:11,652
I'm telling you something weird.

31
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:13,172
Some time ago, I was playing games.

32
00:04:13,172 --> 00:04:14,172
I ran into someone.

33
00:04:14,293 --> 00:04:15,612
He insisted that he was Seven.

34
00:04:16,092 --> 00:04:16,892
That...

35
00:04:16,892 --> 00:04:18,693
Xiao Feng who won the national championship.

36
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,413
Isn't that the worst?

37
00:04:20,732 --> 00:04:21,373
He also said that

38
00:04:21,373 --> 00:04:22,693
Living in 2008,

39
00:04:23,332 --> 00:04:24,052
Of course I don't believe it.

40
00:04:24,052 --> 00:04:25,093
I think he's a liar.

41
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,052
But later, in order to prove that

42
00:04:27,052 --> 00:04:28,452
So he sent me a postcard.

43
00:04:29,172 --> 00:04:29,892
Guess what.

44
00:04:30,653 --> 00:04:31,293
I

45
00:04:31,373 --> 00:04:32,973
A postcard will be added.

46
00:04:34,373 --> 00:04:35,492
The date on the postmark

47
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:37,373
It's August 25, 2008.

48
00:04:39,973 --> 00:04:40,853
He didn't lie to me.

49
00:04:42,012 --> 00:04:43,093
He's really Xiao Feng.

50
00:04:44,612 --> 00:04:45,212
and

51
00:04:47,212 --> 00:04:48,653
It's Xiao Feng from 2008.

52
00:04:51,172 --> 00:04:52,452
Do you know what this means?

53
00:04:54,012 --> 00:04:55,172
Xiao Feng from 2008.

54
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:57,012
Send me a postcard.

55
00:04:57,772 --> 00:04:59,332
I'll really receive it in 2019.

56
00:05:00,492 --> 00:05:01,293
that is

57
00:05:02,732 --> 00:05:04,573
Xiao Feng changed things in 2008.

58
00:05:05,452 --> 00:05:07,052
Will change with it.

59
00:05:08,573 --> 00:05:09,973
According to the date on the postcard,

60
00:05:10,293 --> 00:05:10,892
Are you still here?

61
00:05:13,253 --> 00:05:13,693
that is

62
00:05:13,693 --> 00:05:15,332
As long as he stops you from doing that,

63
00:05:49,012 --> 00:05:49,973
how could that be?

64
00:05:50,332 --> 00:05:51,332
There are usually three people in this position.

65
00:05:51,332 --> 00:05:52,172
You killed it all.

66
00:05:52,253 --> 00:05:53,253
What happened recently, Kai?

67
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:54,573
Something is wrong with you.

68
00:05:54,573 --> 00:05:55,573
If there's anything else,

69
00:05:55,573 --> 00:05:56,612
Tell the brothers

70
00:05:56,853 --> 00:05:58,172
It's okay. What's up?

71
00:05:58,172 --> 00:05:59,892
Don't pretend. It's written on your face.

72
00:05:59,973 --> 00:06:00,492
Since last time,

73
00:06:00,492 --> 00:06:02,093
Was given a knife by that pretty girl soldier.

74
00:06:02,093 --> 00:06:03,452
You've been distracted all day.

75
00:06:03,452 --> 00:06:05,212
Why do you like her?

76
00:06:05,212 --> 00:06:06,093
Is it Brother Kai?

77
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:07,973
Wrong, Brother Kai.

78
00:06:07,973 --> 00:06:08,573
Don't quibble.

79
00:06:08,573 --> 00:06:09,612
Just tell me if I'm right.

80
00:06:10,612 --> 00:06:11,813
What's her name again?

81
00:06:11,813 --> 00:06:13,813
S+1

82
00:06:13,813 --> 00:06:14,813
That bullet

83
00:06:14,813 --> 00:06:16,172
I guess it's in your heart.

84
00:06:21,973 --> 00:06:22,732
I want to know

85
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:24,332
come

86
00:06:25,772 --> 00:06:26,413
come

87
00:06:28,052 --> 00:06:29,212
curious

88
00:06:29,212 --> 00:06:30,293
I just haven't had a good rest recently.

89
00:06:30,293 --> 00:06:30,692
Continue

90
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:32,052
No way

91
00:06:32,052 --> 00:06:32,492
Brother Kai.

92
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:33,252
I have to go to work.

93
00:06:33,653 --> 00:06:34,293
Brother Kai.

94
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,853
The last time you lost your job,

95
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:36,812
Are you still hiding it from the old lady?

96
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:37,333
That's right, Brother Kai.

97
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,132
Are you free?

98
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:39,453
If you're free, you can play with me.

99
00:06:39,453 --> 00:06:40,853
Let's go.

100
00:06:43,013 --> 00:06:44,413
A bunch of untrustworthy people.

101
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:48,653
It's yours.

102
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:53,492
Hey, Kai.

103
00:06:54,172 --> 00:06:55,492
How is your work now?

104
00:06:56,093 --> 00:06:56,413
It's good.

105
00:06:57,973 --> 00:06:59,213
It's right to work hard.

106
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:00,653
You can't be silly.

107
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,013
You can't be deceived.

108
00:07:02,612 --> 00:07:03,413
to feel relieved

109
00:07:04,413 --> 00:07:06,533
The man who tricked your grandson hasn't been born yet.

110
00:07:07,013 --> 00:07:08,372
Look at this.

111
00:07:08,372 --> 00:07:10,013
I'm a great man.

112
00:07:10,213 --> 00:07:11,372
Of course, you have to talk big.

113
00:07:14,213 --> 00:07:15,453
Can you stop playing?

114
00:07:15,732 --> 00:07:16,213
confiscate

115
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:19,293
If you keep acting like this,

116
00:07:19,293 --> 00:07:20,572
She's turning into an internet addict.

117
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:22,492
Seriously,

118
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:23,893
Mom and Dad are calling again.

119
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:26,372
I asked you to get the visa.

120
00:07:26,372 --> 00:07:27,773
Go to Vietnam and find them.

121
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:28,492
grandma

122
00:07:28,732 --> 00:07:30,572
I can take care of myself.

123
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:32,932
According to them,

124
00:07:32,932 --> 00:07:34,572
This is an ultimatum.

125
00:07:35,732 --> 00:07:38,213
They say it's an ultimatum.

126
00:07:38,213 --> 00:07:39,213
Anyway, I'm not going.

127
00:07:39,932 --> 00:07:41,172
They don't want to

128
00:07:41,453 --> 00:07:42,732
What if I leave?

129
00:07:43,773 --> 00:07:45,333
I'm so easy to handle.

130
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:46,572
I was there.

131
00:07:46,572 --> 00:07:49,132
Among all the old men chasing me,

132
00:07:49,252 --> 00:07:51,093
Choose an obedient wife.

133
00:07:51,093 --> 00:07:52,732
I told him to go east. He dared not go west.

134
00:07:52,732 --> 00:07:54,213
I told him to beat the dog. He didn't dare to drive the chicken.

135
00:07:54,213 --> 00:07:54,653
I asked him

136
00:07:54,653 --> 00:07:55,492
grandma

137
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:56,773
Please stop.

138
00:07:57,013 --> 00:07:58,172
Don't you think about it?

139
00:07:58,172 --> 00:07:59,932
Which one of those old men is good at?

140
00:07:59,932 --> 00:08:01,372
Your legs are not sharp.

141
00:08:01,973 --> 00:08:03,093
I didn't dare to think about it.

142
00:08:03,093 --> 00:08:04,612
If you want to be with them,

143
00:08:04,612 --> 00:08:05,172
Tell me,

144
00:08:05,453 --> 00:08:06,533
Who serves whom?

145
00:08:07,492 --> 00:08:08,653
According to my words,

146
00:08:08,893 --> 00:08:10,812
Your grandson, me,

147
00:08:10,812 --> 00:08:12,453
To take care of you personally.

148
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:13,293
Beauty

149
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:13,853
Hurry back.

150
00:08:13,853 --> 00:08:15,252
Take the fan and let's dance.

151
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:17,612
What fan?

152
00:08:17,612 --> 00:08:20,293
You haven't seen my eldest grandson walking with me.

153
00:08:21,372 --> 00:08:22,453
This area

154
00:08:22,453 --> 00:08:23,773
You're lucky.

155
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:27,013
Such a big grandson is absent from work all day.

156
00:08:27,013 --> 00:08:28,853
To be your nanny.

157
00:08:29,612 --> 00:08:31,853
Which eye do you see us not working?

158
00:08:32,293 --> 00:08:33,213
Which one of your eyes?

159
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,492
When I saw my eldest grandson wasn't at work,

160
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:35,973
Come on.

161
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:36,973
My Xiao Wei

162
00:08:37,372 --> 00:08:40,013
I've seen your grandson

163
00:08:40,013 --> 00:08:41,132
To the internet café.

164
00:08:41,132 --> 00:08:42,132
Sap one's spirit by seeking pleasures

165
00:08:42,293 --> 00:08:43,533
It will ruin him.

166
00:08:43,612 --> 00:08:45,653
Don't take it seriously.

167
00:08:45,653 --> 00:08:46,453
I'm telling you,

168
00:08:46,453 --> 00:08:47,653
Young people nowadays

169
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:49,572
The most critical time is these two or three years.

170
00:08:49,692 --> 00:08:50,893
You have to play games all day long.

171
00:08:51,172 --> 00:08:52,252
He'll be delayed.

172
00:08:52,252 --> 00:08:53,052
custom

173
00:08:53,052 --> 00:08:54,653
You're too common.

174
00:08:55,853 --> 00:08:57,612
Do you know what a game is?

175
00:08:57,853 --> 00:08:59,333
When I saw you,

176
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,172
Who doesn't read the news.

177
00:09:01,172 --> 00:09:02,653
I'm speechless.

178
00:09:03,093 --> 00:09:04,612
Do you know what the game is?

179
00:09:05,372 --> 00:09:06,773
In other words,

180
00:09:06,973 --> 00:09:07,893
It's called e-sports.

181
00:09:08,372 --> 00:09:09,612
Officially,

182
00:09:09,973 --> 00:09:13,293
It's a sport recognized by the country.

183
00:09:13,293 --> 00:09:14,293
Really?

184
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:16,093
Our eldest grandson

185
00:09:16,093 --> 00:09:16,973
future

186
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,333
I can't say, he's still a champion.

187
00:09:18,612 --> 00:09:20,132
To fight for the country.

188
00:09:20,132 --> 00:09:22,172
We are still big stars.

189
00:09:23,052 --> 00:09:24,052
This old lady

190
00:09:40,453 --> 00:09:40,973
Give it back.

191
00:09:41,252 --> 00:09:42,172
Give it back to me.

192
00:09:43,853 --> 00:09:44,812
A token of love.

193
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:50,172
This is my brother's.

194
00:09:51,932 --> 00:09:52,973
Eleven years ago,

195
00:09:55,013 --> 00:09:55,812
He's gone.

196
00:10:02,453 --> 00:10:03,213
that

197
00:10:03,213 --> 00:10:04,132
Sorry

198
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:05,132
I really don't know.

199
00:10:06,413 --> 00:10:08,773
No wonder you love it so much.

200
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:10,132
Keep it well.

201
00:10:10,293 --> 00:10:11,172
Don't lose it.

202
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:13,413
It's too late to regret it.

203
00:10:15,052 --> 00:10:16,973
You think everyone is as careless as you?

204
00:10:17,773 --> 00:10:18,572
Also

205
00:10:20,172 --> 00:10:21,732
I once lost a necklace.

206
00:10:24,132 --> 00:10:25,252
I can't find it anymore.

207
00:10:25,773 --> 00:10:27,172
That's your token of love.

208
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:28,413
You should take care of it.

209
00:10:28,973 --> 00:10:30,093
If you have the time,

210
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:32,333
Why don't you spend more time to read English?

211
00:10:32,853 --> 00:10:33,853
The monthly exam is coming tomorrow.

212
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,973
Are you going to choose C for reading comprehension?

213
00:10:36,213 --> 00:10:37,492
Are you blind?

214
00:10:37,492 --> 00:10:38,973
Can't you see I'm working hard every day?

215
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:40,052
Of course I can see it.

216
00:10:40,453 --> 00:10:42,132
I've been memorizing words all day long.

217
00:10:42,132 --> 00:10:43,893
But in practical terms,

218
00:10:44,893 --> 00:10:46,133
It's better to choose C.

219
00:10:46,572 --> 00:10:49,133
It seems that your rehabilitation training is not done well.

220
00:10:49,293 --> 00:10:50,133
after school

221
00:10:50,413 --> 00:10:51,172
You wait.

222
00:10:52,373 --> 00:10:53,052
Not today.

223
00:10:54,332 --> 00:10:55,172
I really can't.

224
00:10:56,092 --> 00:10:57,172
I have something important.

225
00:10:57,613 --> 00:10:58,413
I don't care.

226
00:10:58,572 --> 00:10:59,692
Tell Miss Bai.

227
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:00,972
Make a condition.

228
00:11:00,972 --> 00:11:02,013
Save it!

229
00:11:02,013 --> 00:11:03,293
I'm a man of principle.

230
00:11:03,293 --> 00:11:04,293
Won't be bought.

231
00:11:04,613 --> 00:11:05,452
tonight

232
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:06,893
When you finish your homework,

233
00:11:07,812 --> 00:11:08,533
Deal

234
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:11,452
ChengHao

235
00:11:12,013 --> 00:11:12,572
He's here.

236
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:13,052
We're almost there.

237
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,373
How is the matter I asked you to inquire about?

238
00:11:15,812 --> 00:11:16,572
You must.

239
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:20,533
Long Wan District of Zhong Hua Nan Street.

240
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:21,893
Building 2, Unit 1, 607.

241
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:24,293
Xiao Feng lives there.

242
00:11:24,493 --> 00:11:25,052
Yes

243
00:11:25,812 --> 00:11:26,653
Is it reliable?

244
00:11:26,932 --> 00:11:28,373
Brother Hao, don't you worry?

245
00:11:28,373 --> 00:11:28,972
It's absolutely reliable.

246
00:11:30,052 --> 00:11:30,852
Let's go.

247
00:11:31,852 --> 00:11:32,653
Let's go.

248
00:11:33,253 --> 00:11:34,493
I've been waiting for so long.

249
00:11:38,852 --> 00:11:40,572
The navigation shows that it's here.

250
00:11:41,613 --> 00:11:42,613
Why is there no signal?

251
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:45,773
She's out.

252
00:11:45,932 --> 00:11:47,332
There are still 30 meters left.

253
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:49,413
Right here.

254
00:11:53,452 --> 00:11:54,533
Are you sure this is the place?

255
00:11:54,972 --> 00:11:55,733
determine

256
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:57,133
This is where the phone navigation is.

257
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,332
What's going on here?

258
00:12:00,932 --> 00:12:02,052
It's all torn down.

259
00:12:05,613 --> 00:12:06,172
feed

260
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:07,052
You two,

261
00:12:07,052 --> 00:12:07,773
What are you doing

262
00:12:08,373 --> 00:12:09,253
hello

263
00:12:09,253 --> 00:12:10,172
Excuse me?

264
00:12:10,172 --> 00:12:11,893
Is this the Second Building of Longwan Community?

265
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,692
This place has long been demolished.

266
00:12:14,812 --> 00:12:16,493
I haven't lived here for four or five years.

267
00:12:30,452 --> 00:12:32,572
I remember this was a village in the city.

268
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:34,653
Why did you open it like this?

269
00:13:07,493 --> 00:13:08,493
Why are you here?

270
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:10,293
The monkey married.

271
00:13:10,293 --> 00:13:11,332
This is the invitation.

272
00:13:13,812 --> 00:13:15,373
Why don't you call me?

273
00:13:16,572 --> 00:13:17,692
No more.

274
00:13:17,692 --> 00:13:19,052
You can send a parcel.

275
00:13:20,052 --> 00:13:21,773
Why do you have to go there yourself?

276
00:13:22,972 --> 00:13:23,733
You missed me?

277
00:13:23,893 --> 00:13:25,293
Don't flatter yourself.

278
00:13:25,812 --> 00:13:27,052
I left something here.

279
00:13:32,932 --> 00:13:34,452
I collected all these for you.

280
00:13:57,293 --> 00:13:58,373
Do you need my help?

281
00:13:58,893 --> 00:13:59,852
not need

282
00:14:06,493 --> 00:14:08,773
I think you have a good life.

283
00:14:08,773 --> 00:14:09,852
You've been waiting for me to leave.

284
00:14:09,852 --> 00:14:10,692
Right?

285
00:14:11,293 --> 00:14:12,373
Alright.

286
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:14,373
Since you left,

287
00:14:14,932 --> 00:14:16,332
My life is comfortable.

288
00:14:16,572 --> 00:14:17,572
It smells good.

289
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:18,572
You are very healthy.

290
00:14:19,172 --> 00:14:20,572
I'm sorry.

291
00:14:20,932 --> 00:14:22,493
To waste your beautiful life.

292
00:14:22,493 --> 00:14:23,092
other

293
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:25,533
My wonderful life has just begun.

294
00:14:25,812 --> 00:14:27,013
Hurry up.

295
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:28,133
Boss is not young anymore.

296
00:14:30,692 --> 00:14:31,653
You can't get through.

297
00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:33,172
I can go there.

298
00:14:46,613 --> 00:14:47,572
Close the door.

299
00:15:06,493 --> 00:15:07,052
Xiao Feng.

300
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:08,452
What is it?

301
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:09,893
to value sex over friendship

302
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:14,972
Great Immortal Seven.

303
00:15:14,972 --> 00:15:16,293
Why are you living in this place?

304
00:15:26,852 --> 00:15:29,212
Is really weird.

305
00:15:29,212 --> 00:15:29,972
Xiao Feng has been

306
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:31,852
Seems to have lost contact with everyone.

307
00:15:32,253 --> 00:15:33,972
I've asked around.

308
00:15:34,212 --> 00:15:36,373
I need people to post ads all over the streets.

309
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:38,653
But I don't even have a phone number, a QQ number.

310
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:41,972
Maybe it's because after he retired,

311
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:43,653
Cut off from this circle.

312
00:15:44,052 --> 00:15:44,972
therefore

313
00:15:45,332 --> 00:15:46,452
No one can find him.

314
00:15:47,893 --> 00:15:49,572
Even if I haven't contacted anyone else,

315
00:15:50,293 --> 00:15:52,572
But no one has ever seen him again.

316
00:15:53,293 --> 00:15:54,733
This is a little abnormal.

317
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:17,133
Xiao Xiao.

318
00:16:18,332 --> 00:16:19,092
Director

319
00:16:19,893 --> 00:16:20,493
Are you busy?

320
00:16:20,493 --> 00:16:21,253
Alright.

321
00:16:21,972 --> 00:16:22,533
Alright.

322
00:16:25,212 --> 00:16:25,812
come

323
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:26,812
Xiao Xiao, sit down.

324
00:16:27,932 --> 00:16:28,613
Xiao Xiao.

325
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,253
There's something I've been wanting to say to you.

326
00:16:30,253 --> 00:16:31,613
You're smart.

327
00:16:32,052 --> 00:16:33,013
But not wise.

328
00:16:33,013 --> 00:16:34,692
And inexperienced at work.

329
00:16:34,692 --> 00:16:36,773
This inexperienced one is doomed to suffer.

330
00:16:36,893 --> 00:16:37,893
Without wisdom,

331
00:16:37,893 --> 00:16:38,932
You can't grow.

332
00:16:40,373 --> 00:16:41,133
I'm telling you,

333
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:41,692
leadership

334
00:16:42,092 --> 00:16:43,092
I asked if you were busy.

335
00:16:43,092 --> 00:16:44,332
Can't answer directly.

336
00:16:44,332 --> 00:16:45,332
If you are not busy,

337
00:16:45,332 --> 00:16:46,692
It looks like you're lazy here.

338
00:16:46,692 --> 00:16:47,212
If you want to tell me,

339
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:48,133
I'm busy.

340
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:49,493
How will the leader arrange your work?

341
00:16:49,852 --> 00:16:50,893
So at this moment,

342
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:53,212
There's a standard answer.

343
00:16:53,932 --> 00:16:54,572
Director

344
00:16:54,773 --> 00:16:55,533
What's wrong?

345
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:56,133
Tell me,

346
00:16:58,452 --> 00:16:59,212
Xiao Xiao.

347
00:16:59,493 --> 00:17:00,613
You know it?

348
00:17:01,013 --> 00:17:01,373
Yes

349
00:17:01,373 --> 00:17:02,052
a row

350
00:17:02,052 --> 00:17:03,493
Then I didn't say anything.

351
00:17:04,052 --> 00:17:05,092
Go on.

352
00:17:05,413 --> 00:17:06,092
Alright.

353
00:17:11,493 --> 00:17:12,253
Xiao Xiao.

354
00:17:12,773 --> 00:17:13,172
Director

355
00:17:13,172 --> 00:17:13,773
Are you busy?

356
00:17:14,212 --> 00:17:15,493
Director, what's wrong?

357
00:17:16,692 --> 00:17:17,332
good

358
00:17:17,972 --> 00:17:18,653
such

359
00:17:18,653 --> 00:17:19,812
Do me a favor.

360
00:17:20,533 --> 00:17:21,493
Buy me some.

361
00:17:21,893 --> 00:17:22,692
KFC

362
00:17:23,052 --> 00:17:23,692
good

363
00:17:23,692 --> 00:17:24,332
I will...

364
00:17:24,493 --> 00:17:25,133
Director, wait a moment.

365
00:17:29,332 --> 00:17:29,932
Come in

366
00:17:31,493 --> 00:17:31,893
Director

367
00:17:32,293 --> 00:17:33,932
The KFC you ordered just now.

368
00:17:38,172 --> 00:17:38,692
I

369
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:39,773
I asked you to buy this.

370
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:42,413
You asked me to buy it.

371
00:17:47,373 --> 00:17:47,773
Yes

372
00:17:47,773 --> 00:17:48,852
When you're busy with your work,

373
00:17:48,852 --> 00:17:49,733
I almost forgot.

374
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:51,932
Thank you, Xiao.

375
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:52,932
Nothing

376
00:17:53,613 --> 00:17:54,613
How much is this?

377
00:17:55,172 --> 00:17:56,172
It's not much.

378
00:17:56,332 --> 00:17:57,212
It's 18 yuan.

379
00:17:57,692 --> 00:17:58,893
Okay, I'll give it to you.

380
00:18:07,413 --> 00:18:08,013
Xiao Xiao.

381
00:18:08,013 --> 00:18:08,812
That

382
00:18:08,812 --> 00:18:10,013
Remember, I'll give you

383
00:18:10,013 --> 00:18:10,253
good

384
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:10,852
Remember,

385
00:18:10,852 --> 00:18:11,533
a row

386
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:25,413
Why are there only hamburgers and fries?

387
00:18:26,493 --> 00:18:28,133
KFC

388
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:30,452
You must eat their chicken.

389
00:18:31,253 --> 00:18:32,293
Sorry, Director.

390
00:18:32,293 --> 00:18:32,692
I

391
00:18:32,692 --> 00:18:34,812
I don't know what flavor you like.

392
00:18:34,812 --> 00:18:35,773
Xiao Xiao.

393
00:18:36,253 --> 00:18:38,572
This mouth is not only for eating,

394
00:18:38,572 --> 00:18:39,572
It can talk.

395
00:18:39,572 --> 00:18:40,852
What don't you understand? Ask me.

396
00:18:41,092 --> 00:18:41,812
yes

397
00:18:42,212 --> 00:18:44,133
Wait a moment, I'll change it for you.

398
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:45,052
I'll change it for you.

399
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,293
Alright? Are you in a hurry?

400
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:46,852
Hold on.

401
00:18:48,413 --> 00:18:49,172
By the way, Director,

402
00:18:49,452 --> 00:18:50,613
What flavor do you like?

403
00:18:50,812 --> 00:18:51,812
Roasted or fried?

404
00:18:51,812 --> 00:18:52,893
It's not spicy.

405
00:18:52,893 --> 00:18:54,133
Chicken wings or drumsticks?

406
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,932
How about some ketchup?

407
00:18:55,932 --> 00:18:56,572
good

408
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:57,852
This matter

409
00:18:57,852 --> 00:18:58,533
It's up to you.

410
00:18:59,013 --> 00:18:59,613
I believe in you.

411
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:00,373
I will.

412
00:19:01,653 --> 00:19:02,653
Okay, please wait a moment.

413
00:19:02,653 --> 00:19:03,293
good

414
00:19:03,733 --> 00:19:04,533
hard

415
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:05,212
Nothing

416
00:19:09,893 --> 00:19:10,773
Old schoolmate.

417
00:19:11,212 --> 00:19:13,653
You should listen to my experience.

418
00:19:14,852 --> 00:19:15,533
I'm telling you,

419
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:17,172
These young people

420
00:19:17,372 --> 00:19:18,372
If you don't fight with him,

421
00:19:18,372 --> 00:19:19,372
You can't stand him.

422
00:19:19,372 --> 00:19:22,092
You should first find a way to arrange for him to live.

423
00:19:22,092 --> 00:19:23,533
Don't leave him idle.

424
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:25,332
You know what?

425
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:25,892
When he is free,

426
00:19:25,892 --> 00:19:27,453
Don't you know what's on his mind?

427
00:19:28,493 --> 00:19:29,293
yes

428
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:30,293
I'm telling you,

429
00:19:30,293 --> 00:19:31,453
These children

430
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:33,493
You need to get to know them.

431
00:19:33,493 --> 00:19:35,013
What are you thinking every day?

432
00:19:35,293 --> 00:19:37,293
Is to use various methods.

433
00:19:37,293 --> 00:19:38,173
To contact them.

434
00:19:38,173 --> 00:19:38,933
then

435
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:40,253
After knowing everything,

436
00:19:40,572 --> 00:19:41,773
And then use our methods.

437
00:19:41,773 --> 00:19:42,852
To manage him.

438
00:19:43,013 --> 00:19:43,733
slowly

439
00:19:59,693 --> 00:20:00,293
Xiao Xiao.

440
00:20:00,973 --> 00:20:01,973
Why are you still working?

441
00:20:02,892 --> 00:20:03,412
Director

442
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:05,213
The KFC you want.

443
00:20:05,693 --> 00:20:06,412
Spicy, not spicy.

444
00:20:06,412 --> 00:20:07,412
And ketchup in it.

445
00:20:07,412 --> 00:20:08,332
I bought them all.

446
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:09,693
good

447
00:20:10,253 --> 00:20:11,253
You bought so many.

448
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:13,852
Xiao Xiao.

449
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,013
I can't eat alone with so many of you.

450
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,173
It's a waste if you can't eat it.

451
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:19,132
What a pity to throw it away.

452
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:19,973
yes

453
00:20:22,052 --> 00:20:22,733
Xiao Xiao.

454
00:20:23,052 --> 00:20:24,052
It's getting cold.

455
00:20:24,812 --> 00:20:26,412
Your stomach hurts when you eat it.

456
00:20:26,412 --> 00:20:27,412
I have a stomach ache. I need to see a doctor.

457
00:20:27,412 --> 00:20:28,253
I have to pay for the treatment.

458
00:20:28,253 --> 00:20:29,293
Isn't it a waste again?

459
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:31,773
Just now,

460
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:33,213
Yes, you've been calling.

461
00:20:33,213 --> 00:20:33,852
I just...

462
00:20:34,372 --> 00:20:36,132
What's your problem if I'm not calling?

463
00:20:36,132 --> 00:20:37,773
Why did you call me?

464
00:20:38,253 --> 00:20:40,892
I've told you over and over again, you have to think.

465
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,572
What you do depends on the result.

466
00:20:42,572 --> 00:20:43,453
You didn't end well.

467
00:20:43,453 --> 00:20:45,013
You've worked so hard. Isn't that a waste of effort?

468
00:20:45,013 --> 00:20:45,773
yes

469
00:20:46,213 --> 00:20:47,652
Remember to think more in the future.

470
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:48,332
good

471
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:48,733
That's enough.

472
00:20:48,733 --> 00:20:49,572
Go back now.

473
00:20:49,572 --> 00:20:50,812
If you need me,

474
00:20:50,852 --> 00:20:51,253
good

475
00:20:53,132 --> 00:20:53,933
Thank you for your hard work.

476
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:54,612
good

477
00:21:12,332 --> 00:21:14,293
I cleaned the house today.

478
00:21:14,293 --> 00:21:15,052
I'm warning you.

479
00:21:15,052 --> 00:21:16,852
Don't leave your underwear and socks here and there.

480
00:21:20,173 --> 00:21:21,092
That's not mine.

481
00:21:21,092 --> 00:21:22,132
Or it's mine.

482
00:21:24,892 --> 00:21:25,612
And this one.

483
00:21:25,612 --> 00:21:27,253
I saw it by the garbage can.

484
00:21:27,892 --> 00:21:28,773
Do you want more?

485
00:21:34,372 --> 00:21:34,933
I don't want it.

486
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:35,572
Throw it away.

487
00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:38,812
I didn't expect you to take notes while playing games.

488
00:21:39,013 --> 00:21:39,852
I remember when you were studying,

489
00:21:39,852 --> 00:21:40,693
You're not that serious.

490
00:21:41,493 --> 00:21:42,733
Of course.

491
00:21:43,253 --> 00:21:44,412
Let's play games.

492
00:21:44,412 --> 00:21:45,773
Is much harder than you.

493
00:21:45,773 --> 00:21:47,812
Your exams are dead.

494
00:21:47,812 --> 00:21:48,812
The answer will never change.

495
00:21:49,092 --> 00:21:50,412
The opponent of our competition

496
00:21:50,412 --> 00:21:51,213
Are alive.

497
00:21:51,213 --> 00:21:52,372
Things are always changing.

498
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:53,733
For example,

499
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:55,572
How did the opponent run?

500
00:21:55,852 --> 00:21:56,612
And in the map,

501
00:21:56,612 --> 00:21:57,852
What points are we stuck on?

502
00:21:57,852 --> 00:21:59,933
Under what circumstances, what tactics should we play?

503
00:22:00,173 --> 00:22:01,132
You're very learned.

504
00:22:02,493 --> 00:22:04,213
Is it so complicated?

505
00:22:04,693 --> 00:22:05,933
It's not as easy as you think.

506
00:22:06,612 --> 00:22:07,533
But I think

507
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:08,933
Fighting and killing in the game.

508
00:22:09,213 --> 00:22:10,612
People tend to be violent.

509
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:12,733
How about reading detective novels?

510
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:14,533
To prove that you want to be a serial killer.

511
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:15,493
Before the invention of video games,

512
00:22:15,493 --> 00:22:16,892
The world has never been so peaceful.

513
00:22:18,092 --> 00:22:18,973
Are you sure you don't want it?

514
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:20,213
I don't want it.

515
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,213
Keep your own research.

516
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:24,412
And this one.

517
00:22:24,933 --> 00:22:25,693
It's yours.

518
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:30,453
Why are you so nervous?

519
00:22:30,852 --> 00:22:31,733
You don't understand.

520
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:33,812
before

521
00:22:34,132 --> 00:22:36,092
Whenever I don't know how to choose,

522
00:22:37,052 --> 00:22:38,372
I will let it make the decision for me.

523
00:22:38,612 --> 00:22:39,973
It brought me a lot of good luck.

524
00:22:40,213 --> 00:22:41,612
So the name of my previous team

525
00:22:41,933 --> 00:22:42,773
We'll call it the Coin Team.

526
00:22:45,852 --> 00:22:47,812
It's a matter of probability.

527
00:22:48,052 --> 00:22:49,213
It has nothing to do with luck.

528
00:22:50,612 --> 00:22:52,253
You're a perfect student, you call it probability.

529
00:22:52,253 --> 00:22:54,372
This is called luck.

530
00:22:55,973 --> 00:22:56,773
before

531
00:22:56,773 --> 00:22:58,173
I have many choices to make.

532
00:22:58,612 --> 00:22:59,533
But now,

533
00:22:59,533 --> 00:23:00,412
I won't be able to use it.

534
00:23:04,372 --> 00:23:04,973
Correct!

535
00:23:05,973 --> 00:23:07,213
Our company will give out welfare today.

536
00:23:07,213 --> 00:23:08,092
One person, one pack.

537
00:23:08,973 --> 00:23:10,652
I can't use this for you.

538
00:23:17,572 --> 00:23:19,253
I don't need this.

539
00:23:19,253 --> 00:23:21,173
Face is important to a girl.

540
00:23:21,173 --> 00:23:22,933
How can you sweep the world if you don't sweep the room?

541
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:24,213
You don't even care about your own face.

542
00:23:24,213 --> 00:23:25,173
What can you care about?

543
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:36,572
This unit has also given two

544
00:23:36,572 --> 00:23:37,213
One person.

545
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:40,253
Don't think too much.

546
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,013
What are you doing with my exam paper?

547
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:12,493
Chu song

548
00:24:13,332 --> 00:24:14,652
85 cents.

549
00:24:15,332 --> 00:24:16,412
It's abnormal.

550
00:24:21,572 --> 00:24:22,493
Have you made progress?

551
00:24:22,892 --> 00:24:25,253
At least I didn't choose C for the multiple choice questions.

552
00:24:26,372 --> 00:24:27,173
Minimum

553
00:24:27,173 --> 00:24:29,013
You know your true level.

554
00:24:29,493 --> 00:24:30,412
What do you know?

555
00:24:30,693 --> 00:24:31,533
What don't you know?

556
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:33,372
Next, I'll understand what I don't understand.

557
00:24:33,533 --> 00:24:34,372
That's enough.

558
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:35,693
It's like playing games.

559
00:24:35,693 --> 00:24:37,453
When you know which road is blocked,

560
00:24:38,052 --> 00:24:39,812
You will know which way to go.

561
00:24:57,693 --> 00:24:58,572
The Song of Chu.

562
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:01,052
There are some things that

563
00:25:02,092 --> 00:25:03,253
It's not that bad.

564
00:25:04,293 --> 00:25:05,372
91 points.

565
00:25:06,013 --> 00:25:07,213
Six points higher than me.

566
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:21,132
sixteen

567
00:25:24,213 --> 00:25:25,253
seventeen

568
00:25:28,372 --> 00:25:29,652
eighteen

569
00:25:31,372 --> 00:25:32,493
nineteen

570
00:25:33,173 --> 00:25:34,013
twenty

571
00:25:39,773 --> 00:25:40,693
I can't recite the words.

572
00:25:43,773 --> 00:25:44,933
And forgot it.

573
00:25:44,933 --> 00:25:45,733
can't remember

574
00:25:46,892 --> 00:25:47,933
give up

575
00:25:47,933 --> 00:25:49,213
There are 15 paintings.

576
00:25:49,372 --> 00:25:50,493
And insisted on

577
00:25:50,652 --> 00:25:51,652
There are 16 paintings.

578
00:25:51,652 --> 00:25:53,453
Holding on is only a little more than giving up.

579
00:25:53,453 --> 00:25:55,493
So I insist that others can't.

580
00:25:55,693 --> 00:25:57,612
Can have what others can't have.

581
00:25:59,332 --> 00:26:00,733
Sounds reasonable.

582
00:26:00,852 --> 00:26:02,052
But you really counted the strokes.

583
00:26:02,293 --> 00:26:03,293
I found it online.

584
00:26:05,173 --> 00:26:06,812
Save the poisoned chicken soup and drink it yourself.

585
00:26:06,812 --> 00:26:07,293
I don't need it.

586
00:26:07,293 --> 00:26:07,933
other

587
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:09,892
There are thousands of chicken soup in the world.

588
00:26:10,132 --> 00:26:11,293
There's always a bowl for you.

589
00:26:11,293 --> 00:26:13,973
A squall can turn a 1000-ton ship upside down.

590
00:26:14,412 --> 00:26:15,973
But I can't get a worm

591
00:26:15,973 --> 00:26:16,973
To blow away its nest.

592
00:26:17,173 --> 00:26:18,493
The power of life.

593
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,612
Is not submissive.

594
00:26:22,612 --> 00:26:24,173
You mean I'm worse than a worm?

595
00:26:25,213 --> 00:26:26,052
I didn't mean that.

596
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:27,253
You talk a lot.

597
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,812
I think you haven't done enough training.

598
00:26:29,253 --> 00:26:29,572
I

599
00:26:30,693 --> 00:26:31,213
We can't catch up.

600
00:26:32,013 --> 00:26:32,693
You ran away?

601
00:26:45,453 --> 00:26:46,253
He's here.

602
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:47,132
Well

603
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:11,693
What's wrong with you?

604
00:27:14,253 --> 00:27:15,013
Nothing

605
00:27:18,493 --> 00:27:20,052
Are you being bullied?

606
00:27:22,213 --> 00:27:22,812
No

607
00:27:23,372 --> 00:27:24,812
Don't tell me after bullying.

608
00:27:25,453 --> 00:27:26,253
Really?

609
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:28,013
Cheng Hao was on the streets.

610
00:27:28,253 --> 00:27:30,013
I know all about those punks.

611
00:27:30,612 --> 00:27:31,453
Tell me who did it.

612
00:27:32,812 --> 00:27:33,812
Don't worry about it.

613
00:27:34,852 --> 00:27:35,572
You are my brother.

614
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:36,973
I don't worry about who you worry about.

615
00:27:36,973 --> 00:27:38,132
I can't even protect my own brother.

616
00:27:38,132 --> 00:27:39,693
How can I, Cheng Hao, work in Ningjiang?

617
00:27:39,812 --> 00:27:40,892
Don't you hit your face?

618
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:42,293
I know someone in your school.

619
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:43,412
And a ruthless character.

620
00:27:44,132 --> 00:27:45,453
We'll definitely do it.

621
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:46,533
Why don't you forget it?

622
00:27:46,693 --> 00:27:48,132
What are you afraid of?

623
00:27:48,132 --> 00:27:48,892
those on our side

624
00:27:49,132 --> 00:27:50,973
She's half a relative to me.

625
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:51,933
In the future,

626
00:27:52,493 --> 00:27:53,652
She can support you.

627
00:27:53,852 --> 00:27:54,572
Get to know each other.

628
00:27:55,733 --> 00:27:56,572
He's here.

629
00:28:04,652 --> 00:28:05,293
Chu song

630
00:28:05,372 --> 00:28:06,933
This is my good brother.

631
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:08,973
Peeing and mud grew up together.

632
00:28:08,973 --> 00:28:10,092
The friendship of life.

633
00:28:10,453 --> 00:28:11,412
This is Chu Ge.

634
00:28:11,412 --> 00:28:12,733
I've told her about us.

635
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:13,973
And she promised to help us.

636
00:28:13,973 --> 00:28:15,892
You must teach your deskmate a lesson.

637
00:28:15,892 --> 00:28:16,733
If she doesn't behave,

638
00:28:16,733 --> 00:28:17,892
Let's take off her leg.

639
00:28:18,293 --> 00:28:19,092
misunderstanding

640
00:28:20,612 --> 00:28:21,533
Everything

641
00:28:23,132 --> 00:28:24,453
Was a beautiful misunderstanding.

642
00:28:24,812 --> 00:28:25,973
I don't think it's a misunderstanding.

643
00:28:26,733 --> 00:28:27,773
Are you going to

644
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:29,892
Which leg?

645
00:28:30,852 --> 00:28:32,173
Two legs together.

646
00:28:32,173 --> 00:28:33,572
In a wheelchair with you?

647
00:28:35,572 --> 00:28:36,293
What's wrong?

648
00:28:37,812 --> 00:28:39,092
Two legs are not enough.

649
00:28:39,892 --> 00:28:41,412
I can't risk my life, Xiao Bei.

650
00:28:41,412 --> 00:28:42,572
Almost there.

651
00:28:43,493 --> 00:28:44,933
Look at our brothers.

652
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:45,812
Chuge, hurry up.

653
00:28:45,812 --> 00:28:47,213
Let's go find his deskmate.

654
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:07,052
Life is like a dream.

655
00:29:09,293 --> 00:29:11,612
And I've been having nightmares these days.

656
00:29:13,453 --> 00:29:14,213
I don't know.

657
00:29:14,213 --> 00:29:15,612
You have such a relative.

658
00:29:15,733 --> 00:29:17,612
Her stepfather is my distant cousin.

659
00:29:18,092 --> 00:29:19,453
My cousin is also bad-tempered.

660
00:29:19,453 --> 00:29:20,773
They are at home.

661
00:29:20,773 --> 00:29:22,092
Everything depends on him.

662
00:29:22,092 --> 00:29:24,052
It's like being beaten and scolded.

663
00:29:25,092 --> 00:29:25,733
therefore

664
00:29:26,852 --> 00:29:27,572
It's not easy for her.

665
00:29:36,892 --> 00:29:37,612
Boss, I...

666
00:29:38,412 --> 00:29:39,693
I will rest for a while.

667
00:29:39,693 --> 00:29:40,892
I'll settle the account then.

668
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:42,453
Don't you have to leave?

669
00:29:42,453 --> 00:29:44,372
You should settle the previous account.

670
00:29:44,372 --> 00:29:45,572
That's 86.

671
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,132
Twenty-five.

672
00:29:53,253 --> 00:29:54,052
thirty

673
00:29:55,013 --> 00:29:55,852
Thirty-one

674
00:29:56,332 --> 00:29:56,812
Thirty-six

675
00:29:56,812 --> 00:29:57,612
Stop counting.

676
00:29:57,612 --> 00:29:58,612
Leave now.

677
00:30:00,052 --> 00:30:01,693
Don't go to the outside for business.

678
00:30:01,693 --> 00:30:02,372
This is my friend.

679
00:30:02,372 --> 00:30:03,493
How much is the internet fee? I'll pay for him.

680
00:30:03,612 --> 00:30:04,412
Eighty-six.

681
00:30:06,773 --> 00:30:07,973
Who's your friend?

682
00:30:08,332 --> 00:30:09,092
It's paid.

683
00:30:11,253 --> 00:30:12,372
Not now.

684
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:14,132
It doesn't mean that you won't be

685
00:30:16,173 --> 00:30:17,173
I heard that

686
00:30:17,173 --> 00:30:18,493
You lost your job and dared not go home.

687
00:30:18,973 --> 00:30:20,092
Stay here all day.

688
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:21,533
I came to see you.

689
00:30:23,132 --> 00:30:24,173
I hate to see you.

690
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:35,892
I'm hungry

691
00:30:35,892 --> 00:30:36,773
It's none of your business

692
00:30:49,693 --> 00:30:51,733
I bought it on the way. It's still warm.

693
00:30:57,173 --> 00:30:58,412
It's finally here.

694
00:31:00,412 --> 00:31:02,213
Hot and delicious pizza.

695
00:31:04,213 --> 00:31:05,933
The filling cheese is thick enough.

696
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:06,733
Yummy

697
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,493
Wang Kai, I know you're

698
00:31:09,693 --> 00:31:10,533
And lost my job.

699
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:11,533
The team has also broken up.

700
00:31:11,533 --> 00:31:12,693
And dared not return home.

701
00:31:12,892 --> 00:31:13,933
If so,

702
00:31:13,933 --> 00:31:15,213
Why don't you go to my place?

703
00:31:15,213 --> 00:31:17,013
Control the food, control the machine.

704
00:31:17,213 --> 00:31:18,013
I'm telling you,

705
00:31:18,453 --> 00:31:19,293
reluctant to admit a mistake

706
00:31:19,453 --> 00:31:20,652
You can't make a living.

707
00:31:20,973 --> 00:31:22,412
I really want to be your friend.

708
00:31:22,733 --> 00:31:23,412
WangKai

709
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:25,892
Let's play together.

710
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:27,173
I promise you won't regret it.

711
00:31:29,412 --> 00:31:30,493
Have a bite.

712
00:31:31,092 --> 00:31:32,052
You must be hungry.

713
00:31:33,173 --> 00:31:33,892
Yes?

714
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,132
Are you waiting for me to feed you?

715
00:31:39,852 --> 00:31:40,773
It's delicious.

716
00:31:43,332 --> 00:31:44,733
I'm not beating around the bush.

717
00:31:45,052 --> 00:31:47,493
Lu Xiao Bei asked me to recruit you into the team.

718
00:31:47,852 --> 00:31:49,652
He promised to install a bathtub for me.

719
00:31:50,293 --> 00:31:52,293
If you can take a bath before you go to bed,

720
00:31:52,733 --> 00:31:54,852
This is the life of an elf.

721
00:31:54,852 --> 00:31:55,612
to wait a moment

722
00:31:59,372 --> 00:32:00,733
Are you all living together?

723
00:32:03,052 --> 00:32:03,973
Or what?

724
00:32:04,372 --> 00:32:06,852
You people don't have a place for me.

725
00:32:12,372 --> 00:32:12,852
go

726
00:32:13,253 --> 00:32:14,052
Where are you going?

727
00:32:14,372 --> 00:32:15,132
get home

728
00:32:17,132 --> 00:32:18,652
Home is over there.

729
00:32:25,372 --> 00:32:26,253
Aunts and uncles, congratulations.

730
00:32:26,493 --> 00:32:27,013
congratulations

731
00:32:27,013 --> 00:32:27,892
Sign it together.

732
00:32:27,892 --> 00:32:28,372
good

733
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:34,052
Brother Feng,

734
00:32:36,933 --> 00:32:37,612
Uncle and aunt.

735
00:32:47,773 --> 00:32:49,092
Why is it an IOU?

736
00:32:50,572 --> 00:32:51,612
What friend?

737
00:32:51,612 --> 00:32:52,693
I will return it.

738
00:32:52,933 --> 00:32:53,293
Go inside.

739
00:32:53,293 --> 00:32:54,132
You're still working.

740
00:32:54,132 --> 00:32:55,132
Go inside on the wedding day.

741
00:32:55,812 --> 00:32:56,892
Be rather baffling

742
00:32:59,572 --> 00:33:01,572
Thank you all.

743
00:33:01,572 --> 00:33:04,973
Everyone, come to our wedding.

744
00:33:04,973 --> 00:33:06,372
To marry Lingling.

745
00:33:07,132 --> 00:33:10,293
Is the most important decision I have made in my life.

746
00:33:10,453 --> 00:33:12,812
Over the past 20 years, I have been

747
00:33:12,812 --> 00:33:14,973
Without success or fame,

748
00:33:15,173 --> 00:33:16,572
But I understand one thing.

749
00:33:16,852 --> 00:33:18,092
In this world,

750
00:33:18,092 --> 00:33:19,652
Money is not permanent.

751
00:33:19,652 --> 00:33:21,173
Honor is not permanent.

752
00:33:21,493 --> 00:33:23,173
Even your best friend

753
00:33:23,533 --> 00:33:26,332
Can't always be by your side.

754
00:33:29,612 --> 00:33:31,213
Who can be loyal to you.

755
00:33:31,533 --> 00:33:32,092
Only your family

756
00:33:32,092 --> 00:33:33,132
Monkey is so handsome today.

757
00:33:33,253 --> 00:33:34,652
I will definitely be able to

758
00:33:35,773 --> 00:33:39,132
Hand in hand to the day when the seas run dry and the rocks rot.

759
00:33:46,453 --> 00:33:48,213
Eat and drink well.

760
00:33:56,132 --> 00:33:58,092
They are so touching today.

761
00:34:05,973 --> 00:34:07,253
Have you made up with Lin Lin?

762
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,533
Don't bother.

763
00:34:08,933 --> 00:34:10,293
Almost there.

764
00:34:10,293 --> 00:34:12,332
There's no knot in the world that can't be solved.

765
00:34:12,332 --> 00:34:13,493
After you attend the wedding,

766
00:34:13,493 --> 00:34:15,013
Don't you want to get married?

767
00:34:15,013 --> 00:34:17,612
Do you feel like dying after attending the funeral?

768
00:34:43,572 --> 00:34:45,052
The school made repeated orders.

769
00:34:45,213 --> 00:34:46,973
Don't bring your phone to class.

770
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:48,652
Why are you doing this knowingly?

771
00:34:51,052 --> 00:34:51,733
You're annoying.

772
00:34:53,733 --> 00:34:55,092
You're sleeping in class.

773
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:56,372
Play with your phone.

774
00:34:56,372 --> 00:34:57,933
You came to school with your parents' money.

775
00:34:57,933 --> 00:34:59,253
Are you just fooling around?

776
00:34:59,572 --> 00:35:00,533
Take out your phone.

777
00:35:01,652 --> 00:35:03,052
Are you playing hide-and-seek with me?

778
00:35:15,892 --> 00:35:17,052
Is he using his phone?

779
00:35:19,453 --> 00:35:21,173
I didn't know I was sleeping.

780
00:35:21,412 --> 00:35:23,253
It's definitely not his first time to use the phone.

781
00:35:23,253 --> 00:35:24,453
You must have seen it.

782
00:35:24,453 --> 00:35:26,973
It's not my first time to sleep in class.

783
00:35:27,332 --> 00:35:28,092
CHUJIANG

784
00:35:28,213 --> 00:35:29,412
Chu song

785
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:33,213
It's against the rules for him to play with his phone in class.

786
00:35:33,533 --> 00:35:35,572
Sleeping in class is not against the rules.

787
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:36,812
This matter

788
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:39,332
I've been wanting to talk to your parents.

789
00:35:40,293 --> 00:35:42,052
Did he hide the phone on you?

790
00:35:45,773 --> 00:35:48,052
If you take out Lu Xiao Bei's phone,

791
00:35:48,973 --> 00:35:50,612
To interview the parents.

792
00:35:50,612 --> 00:35:51,812
I can think about it.

793
00:35:58,213 --> 00:36:00,612
Director, why don't you search my

794
00:36:01,852 --> 00:36:02,612
good

795
00:36:04,052 --> 00:36:05,332
Don't bother other students.

796
00:36:05,892 --> 00:36:07,173
You two go to my office.

797
00:36:12,493 --> 00:36:13,533
Why are you still standing?

798
00:36:13,973 --> 00:36:15,372
Don't let me catch you next time.

799
00:36:16,533 --> 00:36:17,493
Go back to the classroom.

800
00:36:26,492 --> 00:36:28,053
You're so loyal today.

801
00:36:29,492 --> 00:36:30,293
Thanks.

802
00:36:31,492 --> 00:36:32,452
Don't thank me.

803
00:36:32,452 --> 00:36:33,332
I will help you.

804
00:36:34,932 --> 00:36:36,372
Can you start today?

805
00:36:36,372 --> 00:36:37,452
Help me with my tuition seriously.

806
00:36:40,012 --> 00:36:40,812
a row

807
00:36:40,812 --> 00:36:41,693
no problem

808
00:36:43,332 --> 00:36:43,972
Correct!

809
00:36:44,213 --> 00:36:45,133
Add a WeChat.

810
00:36:45,932 --> 00:36:47,372
It's easier to help you with your studies.

811
00:36:59,812 --> 00:37:01,773
Why did you block me when you added it on WeChat?

812
00:37:02,213 --> 00:37:03,412
I didn't block you.

813
00:37:04,133 --> 00:37:05,532
How come the WeChat Moments are empty?

814
00:37:06,293 --> 00:37:08,173
I have no friends who don't share it on WeChat Moments.

815
00:37:12,012 --> 00:37:12,532
congratulations

816
00:37:13,173 --> 00:37:14,093
I said monkey.

817
00:37:15,452 --> 00:37:16,653
Look at that girl.

818
00:37:17,213 --> 00:37:18,213
Are pretty.

819
00:37:19,053 --> 00:37:21,372
How did you get rid of all the girls

820
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,972
To pick out your wife.

821
00:37:24,852 --> 00:37:26,253
Don't drink.

822
00:37:26,253 --> 00:37:27,492
drink

823
00:37:27,492 --> 00:37:28,213
come

824
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:28,892
It's done.

825
00:37:35,773 --> 00:37:36,372
There's no more wine.

826
00:37:36,372 --> 00:37:36,972
take

827
00:37:36,972 --> 00:37:37,573
Yes

828
00:37:37,573 --> 00:37:37,972
Over there.

829
00:37:38,012 --> 00:37:38,852
Kirin, take it.

830
00:37:39,213 --> 00:37:40,093
Yes

831
00:37:40,372 --> 00:37:41,293
Fill it up.

832
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:42,653
Ming, pour it for you.

833
00:37:42,653 --> 00:37:43,372
Here, pour it.

834
00:37:43,492 --> 00:37:44,653
It's endless.

835
00:37:45,293 --> 00:37:47,372
You can get married with them.

836
00:37:47,452 --> 00:37:48,492
Get out of the way.

837
00:37:49,332 --> 00:37:50,653
I'll have a drink with the brothers.

838
00:37:50,892 --> 00:37:51,492
Get up.

839
00:37:52,053 --> 00:37:52,412
go

840
00:37:52,412 --> 00:37:53,332
monkey

841
00:37:53,532 --> 00:37:54,532
Sister-in-law

842
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:55,932
Happy wedding.

843
00:37:58,412 --> 00:37:59,932
Get up.

844
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:03,532
It's rare for us to get together.

845
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:04,452
Are you free later?

846
00:38:04,452 --> 00:38:05,213
Yes

847
00:38:05,532 --> 00:38:06,693
The internet café nearby.

848
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:07,693
good

849
00:38:07,693 --> 00:38:08,613
I'm itching recently.

850
00:38:08,613 --> 00:38:09,213
can

851
00:38:09,213 --> 00:38:09,932
Don't bother.

852
00:38:17,492 --> 00:38:18,932
Are you looking for a team recently?

853
00:38:19,053 --> 00:38:20,093
It's none of your business.

854
00:38:23,613 --> 00:38:24,293
I'm telling you,

855
00:38:24,492 --> 00:38:25,693
Stop looking for the team.

856
00:38:25,693 --> 00:38:27,932
No team wants you.

857
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:30,293
Without my spy to cover for you,

858
00:38:30,293 --> 00:38:31,932
You're a third-rate.

859
00:38:31,932 --> 00:38:34,012
Xiao Feng, what are you doing?

860
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:35,053
What did you say

861
00:38:35,053 --> 00:38:37,093
You disbanded the team.

862
00:38:37,093 --> 00:38:38,532
How dare you come to us?

863
00:38:38,532 --> 00:38:39,412
What are you doing?

864
00:38:39,412 --> 00:38:40,332
I'm looking for you.

865
00:38:40,332 --> 00:38:41,213
Take it.

866
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:42,653
I'll let you smoke.

867
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,613
Feel free to smoke.

868
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:44,653
Until you're happy.

869
00:38:44,653 --> 00:38:46,093
I want to beat you. I can be happy.

870
00:38:46,133 --> 00:38:48,053
I have slapped you 108,000 times.

871
00:38:48,053 --> 00:38:49,653
Why are you unhappy?

872
00:38:49,733 --> 00:38:51,053
The team is dismissed.

873
00:38:51,053 --> 00:38:52,372
But aren't we still here?

874
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:53,412
We've been together for so many years.

875
00:38:53,412 --> 00:38:55,213
You're not friends after you leave, right?

876
00:38:55,773 --> 00:38:57,412
Today is the day of monkey wedding.

877
00:38:57,412 --> 00:38:59,053
Why don't we stop fighting?

878
00:38:59,613 --> 00:39:00,812
Don't stop them.

879
00:39:00,812 --> 00:39:02,972
Both of them are on fire.

880
00:39:02,972 --> 00:39:04,773
Let them fight to vent their anger.

881
00:39:04,972 --> 00:39:05,372
hit

882
00:39:05,372 --> 00:39:06,653
Let's go to another place.

883
00:39:11,253 --> 00:39:12,253
To be honest,

884
00:39:13,213 --> 00:39:14,653
I really miss the past.

885
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:17,972
Back then, no matter what conflicts we had,

886
00:39:17,972 --> 00:39:19,173
Close the door and fight.

887
00:39:19,173 --> 00:39:20,213
Everything has been solved.

888
00:39:20,932 --> 00:39:21,733
Now,

889
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:24,293
Now I'll beat you up.

890
00:39:24,372 --> 00:39:26,653
Besides letting you work at work for a few days,

891
00:39:26,653 --> 00:39:28,012
What else can I do?

892
00:39:35,253 --> 00:39:36,173
I'm telling you,

893
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:39,332
In my lifetime,

894
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,173
You can't live on foolishness.

895
00:39:43,773 --> 00:39:44,452
right or wrong?

896
00:39:45,012 --> 00:39:46,133
Look at us.

897
00:39:46,852 --> 00:39:48,492
One is better than the other.

898
00:39:48,492 --> 00:39:49,532
Look at you.

899
00:39:49,532 --> 00:39:51,053
Come on.

900
00:39:51,852 --> 00:39:53,213
Xiao Feng, tell the truth.

901
00:39:53,492 --> 00:39:55,213
Are you happy now?

902
00:39:56,053 --> 00:39:57,213
I'm happy.

903
00:39:58,053 --> 00:39:59,573
I'm so happy.

904
00:40:01,093 --> 00:40:02,932
I'm telling you, man, I'm almost there.

905
00:40:03,852 --> 00:40:04,852
Try harder.

906
00:40:04,852 --> 00:40:05,773
You have great power.

907
00:40:06,133 --> 00:40:08,293
I drank wine and slept and earned money.

908
00:40:08,293 --> 00:40:09,293
Can I be unhappy?

909
00:40:09,293 --> 00:40:10,372
Why are you so happy?

910
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:11,653
I'm just happy.

911
00:40:11,653 --> 00:40:12,852
Don't lie to yourself.

912
00:40:12,892 --> 00:40:13,613
I'm telling you,

913
00:40:13,613 --> 00:40:15,293
Do you know who I look down on the most?

914
00:40:15,293 --> 00:40:17,012
You know, the people on the street

915
00:40:17,012 --> 00:40:18,653
A young man without ambition.

916
00:40:18,852 --> 00:40:19,773
Do you know

917
00:40:19,773 --> 00:40:21,173
What's the only difference?

918
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:23,133
You're not young anymore.

919
00:40:35,852 --> 00:40:37,253
I want to go back to the past.

920
00:40:42,213 --> 00:40:42,852
What are you doing?

921
00:40:43,613 --> 00:40:44,613
What are you looking at?

922
00:40:45,653 --> 00:40:47,532
I'm looking at you.

923
00:40:47,532 --> 00:40:49,532
I've been silent for a long time. Are you making a face?

924
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:49,932
Don't fight.

925
00:40:49,932 --> 00:40:50,812
I will beat you.

926
00:40:52,012 --> 00:40:53,332
What are you doing with me every day?

927
00:40:53,532 --> 00:40:54,733
What are you doing with me?

928
00:40:55,613 --> 00:40:56,253
Do not

929
00:40:56,773 --> 00:40:57,372
Don't fight.

930
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:58,093
What are you doing with me?

931
00:40:58,093 --> 00:40:58,972
What's wrong with you and me?

932
00:40:59,213 --> 00:40:59,653
you

933
00:41:00,573 --> 00:41:01,053
Don't hit me.

934
00:41:01,812 --> 00:41:03,173
Don't fight.

935
00:41:04,492 --> 00:41:05,253
let go

936
00:41:05,653 --> 00:41:06,133
other

937
00:41:06,773 --> 00:41:07,613
Don't fight.

938
00:41:08,412 --> 00:41:09,133
let go

939
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,653
Are you wrong?

940
00:41:10,653 --> 00:41:11,812
Are you wrong?

941
00:42:04,093 --> 00:42:04,812
Xiao Feng.

942
00:42:05,372 --> 00:42:06,173
Xiao Feng.

943
00:42:07,293 --> 00:42:07,932
hi

944
00:42:08,653 --> 00:42:09,613
Finally, I see you again.

945
00:42:10,053 --> 00:42:11,733
I received the postcard you sent me.

946
00:42:12,173 --> 00:42:12,773
Now,

947
00:42:12,773 --> 00:42:13,492
I definitely believe that

948
00:42:13,492 --> 00:42:14,852
From 2008.

949
00:42:16,093 --> 00:42:16,693
Correct!

950
00:42:17,012 --> 00:42:17,932
I counted

951
00:42:17,932 --> 00:42:19,573
Every time we talked,

952
00:42:19,693 --> 00:42:20,972
Is about two minutes and thirty seconds.

953
00:42:21,253 --> 00:42:22,972
That's the time of the explosive mode.

954
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,613
We still have two minutes and ten seconds.

955
00:42:33,253 --> 00:42:34,012
Are you all right?

956
00:42:34,012 --> 00:42:34,653
Nothing

957
00:42:35,213 --> 00:42:35,812
Sorry

958
00:42:35,812 --> 00:42:37,093
I drank a lot today.

959
00:42:38,532 --> 00:42:39,693
But don't worry.

960
00:42:39,892 --> 00:42:40,412
I

961
00:42:40,573 --> 00:42:41,293
I won't.

962
00:42:41,852 --> 00:42:43,693
I won't waste your time.

963
00:42:46,213 --> 00:42:46,852
Here's the thing.

964
00:42:47,613 --> 00:42:48,812
I have a very important thing.

965
00:42:48,812 --> 00:42:49,852
I want you to help me.

966
00:42:51,573 --> 00:42:52,573
Last time,

967
00:42:53,012 --> 00:42:55,573
After I won the championship,

968
00:42:56,332 --> 00:42:57,372
What else did you take?

969
00:42:58,293 --> 00:42:59,012
King of the Golden Spear.

970
00:42:59,253 --> 00:43:00,213
King of the Golden Spear.

971
00:43:02,452 --> 00:43:04,012
Then tell me about it.

972
00:43:04,372 --> 00:43:05,173
we

973
00:43:05,532 --> 00:43:06,213
The Coin Team.

974
00:43:06,492 --> 00:43:07,653
When you won the championship,

975
00:43:07,733 --> 00:43:08,573
Our team

976
00:43:11,653 --> 00:43:12,892
Except for me,

977
00:43:13,852 --> 00:43:14,532
Who else?

978
00:43:15,133 --> 00:43:16,093
I can't remember.

979
00:43:18,452 --> 00:43:19,293
what

980
00:43:19,573 --> 00:43:20,452
not be able to hear

981
00:43:22,012 --> 00:43:23,653
I said I can't remember clearly.

982
00:43:23,653 --> 00:43:25,133
Why don't you check it for me?

983
00:43:27,492 --> 00:43:28,012
Xiao Feng.

984
00:43:28,332 --> 00:43:29,012
Listen to me.

985
00:43:29,253 --> 00:43:30,613
I have something very important.

986
00:43:30,613 --> 00:43:31,452
I want you to help me.

987
00:43:31,892 --> 00:43:32,852
Can you help me find

988
00:43:32,852 --> 00:43:33,892
Who called Lu Xiaonan.

989
00:43:34,573 --> 00:43:35,932
Your business is not important.

990
00:43:36,293 --> 00:43:37,213
Help me first.

991
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:39,332
At least, I'm your senior.

992
00:43:39,932 --> 00:43:40,653
a row

993
00:43:43,653 --> 00:43:45,532
In 2008, the first national

994
00:43:45,532 --> 00:43:47,693
The winner of Crossfire Challenge.

995
00:43:47,852 --> 00:43:48,653
The Coin Team.

996
00:43:48,653 --> 00:43:50,892
Captain and sniper Seven

997
00:43:50,892 --> 00:43:52,173
Breakout Player DW

998
00:43:52,173 --> 00:43:53,293
Breakout player Aming

999
00:43:53,332 --> 00:43:54,613
The breakout player is 7lin.

1000
00:43:54,733 --> 00:43:56,253
24k off.

1001
00:43:57,972 --> 00:43:58,613
Wait a second.

1002
00:43:58,812 --> 00:44:00,492
Who is 24k?

1003
00:44:00,492 --> 00:44:01,332
I don't know her.

1004
00:44:02,412 --> 00:44:04,012
Here's a profile. I'll take a look.

1005
00:44:04,293 --> 00:44:06,253
24k legendary sniper

1006
00:44:06,253 --> 00:44:07,452
Is very explosive in the game.

1007
00:44:07,733 --> 00:44:09,733
When the team is under great pressure,

1008
00:44:09,733 --> 00:44:10,653
Open the situation.

1009
00:44:18,053 --> 00:44:18,693
Xiaobei

1010
00:44:19,133 --> 00:44:20,372
Who were you talking to just now?

1011
00:44:20,613 --> 00:44:22,253
No, I'm reading history.

1012
00:44:22,452 --> 00:44:22,892
come

1013
00:44:23,173 --> 00:44:24,053
Have some apples.

1014
00:44:25,812 --> 00:44:26,693
I'll eat it myself.

1015
00:44:27,012 --> 00:44:29,012
You didn't wash your hands. It's so dirty.

1016
00:44:29,613 --> 00:44:30,412
I'll do it for you.

1017
00:44:39,932 --> 00:44:40,733
Xiaobei

1018
00:44:41,293 --> 00:44:42,452
Why aren't you moving?

1019
00:44:43,693 --> 00:44:44,412
Xiaobei

1020
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:45,532
Xiaobei

1021
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:46,452
Xiaobei

1022
00:44:50,452 --> 00:44:51,812
Xiaobei

1023
00:44:55,532 --> 00:44:56,213
Xiaobei

1024
00:44:58,332 --> 00:44:59,492
Your hands are dirty.

1025
00:45:00,173 --> 00:45:01,253
Use the fork for a while.

1026
00:45:04,972 --> 00:45:05,532
Xiaobei

1027
00:45:13,492 --> 00:45:14,173
Thank you, mom.

1028
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:15,733
It's so sweet.

1029
00:45:16,053 --> 00:45:16,733
Eat more.

1030
00:45:24,053 --> 00:45:25,053
Enough

1031
00:45:25,773 --> 00:45:26,733
That's enough, Mom.

1032
00:45:27,053 --> 00:45:28,492
I can't eat so much.

1033
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:29,492
I can eat it.

1034
00:45:31,372 --> 00:45:32,613
Don't cut it.

1035
00:45:33,053 --> 00:45:33,693
I can.

1036
00:45:36,293 --> 00:45:37,133
Enough

1037
00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:42,093
You can eat it yourself.

1038
00:45:42,093 --> 00:45:42,653
good

1039
00:45:42,653 --> 00:45:43,492
You ate my son.

1040
00:45:43,653 --> 00:45:44,053
good

1041
00:45:44,412 --> 00:45:44,812
good

1042
00:46:03,492 --> 00:46:03,972
Xiao Feng.

1043
