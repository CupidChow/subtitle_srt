1
00:02:18,085 --> 00:02:18,918
What do you mean?

2
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,085
I've finished your work.

3
00:02:21,085 --> 00:02:22,126
You want to lie to me?

4
00:02:22,126 --> 00:02:22,460
No

5
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,501
Give me a few more days.

6
00:02:23,918 --> 00:02:24,751
Look, last time it rained,

7
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:25,751
Half of the building collapsed.

8
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:27,085
I have lost money and labor.

9
00:02:27,293 --> 00:02:28,626
I really don't have

10
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,710
That's your business.

11
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,710
Think of a way.

12
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:31,418
Now?

13
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,668
My workers are all demanding payment from me.

14
00:02:33,668 --> 00:02:35,751
But I can't afford it now.

15
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:36,710
No money, right?

16
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:37,835
Come on.

17
00:02:37,835 --> 00:02:39,126
The remaining half of the building

18
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:39,793
Take them off.

19
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:40,210
other

20
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:40,876
I beg you.

21
00:02:40,876 --> 00:02:41,168
Wait

22
00:02:41,585 --> 00:02:42,501
Dare not.

23
00:02:42,835 --> 00:02:43,460
Dare not.

24
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:44,376
Take the money.

25
00:02:57,418 --> 00:02:58,335
Boss, look.

26
00:02:58,626 --> 00:03:00,210
There are so many ups and downs.

27
00:03:00,793 --> 00:03:01,960
I'm going to buy cement.

28
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,751
I'll give you the money to buy vegetables.

29
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:04,751
behind

30
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:05,835
I'll figure something out.

31
00:03:05,835 --> 00:03:07,376
I'll give you three more days.

32
00:03:07,418 --> 00:03:09,460
If you don't settle the account within three days,

33
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:09,793
here

34
00:03:10,085 --> 00:03:10,960
It will be flat.

35
00:03:11,543 --> 00:03:12,001
go

36
00:03:12,835 --> 00:03:13,335
Boss

37
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,001
There's another problem.

38
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,210
Remember to remind this one.

39
00:03:25,543 --> 00:03:26,376
What's going on?

40
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:27,626
dad

41
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,293
Your son won the national championship.

42
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,376
The TV station is here to interview.

43
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,168
What are you waiting for?

44
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,168
Hurry. Come here.

45
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:35,835
dad

46
00:03:36,626 --> 00:03:37,043
fast

47
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:39,918
Have a seat.

48
00:03:44,543 --> 00:03:45,043
come

49
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,335
This is 50,000 yuan.

50
00:03:47,335 --> 00:03:48,376
Apart from building and decoration,

51
00:03:48,626 --> 00:03:50,085
You can keep the rest.

52
00:03:50,085 --> 00:03:51,043
Buy whatever you want.

53
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:53,168
this

54
00:03:53,626 --> 00:03:54,043
son

55
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:55,876
Where did you get so much money?

56
00:03:55,876 --> 00:03:56,960
I told you.

57
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,418
Your son is a national champion now.

58
00:03:58,626 --> 00:03:59,918
This is the winner's bonus.

59
00:04:00,293 --> 00:04:01,668
All earned by your son playing games.

60
00:04:02,293 --> 00:04:03,001
Don't worry.

61
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:04,251
Every one of them is clean.

62
00:04:04,251 --> 00:04:05,001
Tax according to law

63
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:05,710
Honest labor

64
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,460
Don't worry.

65
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:09,168
Look at this.

66
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:11,085
I've never seen so many.

67
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:14,168
Miss Xiao.

68
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,418
We can start the interview now.

69
00:04:15,585 --> 00:04:16,210
good

70
00:04:16,543 --> 00:04:16,918
dad

71
00:04:17,251 --> 00:04:18,376
Change into new clothes.

72
00:04:18,835 --> 00:04:20,043
The plaid shirt.

73
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:20,543
fast

74
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:21,418
Don't.

75
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,668
Interview

76
00:04:22,668 --> 00:04:23,001
I

77
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:24,960
The whole country is watching. Hurry.

78
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:30,001
My mom also called dad.

79
00:04:32,376 --> 00:04:34,751
Father Xiao, why don't you say something?

80
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,751
good

81
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:40,293
Xiao Feng

82
00:04:40,293 --> 00:04:42,418
I didn't do well in exams when I was young.

83
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,793
And won't listen to us.

84
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,210
But he's very smart.

85
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,126
And has a good memory.

86
00:04:48,126 --> 00:04:49,335
You react so fast.

87
00:04:49,335 --> 00:04:51,460
And filial to his parents. He's a good boy.

88
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:53,293
Yes

89
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:54,543
That's right.

90
00:04:55,168 --> 00:04:56,418
His brain

91
00:04:56,418 --> 00:04:57,501
Follow me.

92
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:01,918
son

93
00:05:02,543 --> 00:05:03,585
You can't spend so much money.

94
00:05:03,585 --> 00:05:04,751
Thirty thousand is enough.

95
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:05,585
That's enough.

96
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:06,460
Take this back.

97
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:08,793
Your career is on the rise.

98
00:05:08,793 --> 00:05:10,168
You spend a lot of money.

99
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:11,960
Dad, you can rest assured to use this.

100
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,085
I'm just getting started.

101
00:05:13,251 --> 00:05:14,418
To earn more in the future.

102
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:15,085
come

103
00:05:22,668 --> 00:05:23,460
I'll pour you another cup.

104
00:05:23,626 --> 00:05:24,501
This man

105
00:05:25,043 --> 00:05:26,626
You should put your career first.

106
00:05:27,876 --> 00:05:29,251
Making money is one thing.

107
00:05:29,251 --> 00:05:31,168
To do what you want to do well.

108
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,501
To achieve success.

109
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:33,626
This is more important.

110
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:34,585
dad

111
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:35,460
Don't worry.

112
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,460
I'm not only going to win the national championship,

113
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:40,626
I have to play abroad on behalf of the country.

114
00:05:41,793 --> 00:05:42,668
For the country.

115
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,793
It's important to win the championship.

116
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,585
Finding a boyfriend is more important.

117
00:05:47,793 --> 00:05:49,126
She's in her late twenties.

118
00:05:49,668 --> 00:05:51,001
You need to think about yourself.

119
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,126
Mom, you don't have to worry about this.

120
00:05:55,376 --> 00:05:57,501
Wait for me to get a good result in the World Series.

121
00:05:57,501 --> 00:05:59,001
I will definitely bring you a wife.

122
00:05:59,043 --> 00:06:00,210
Really?

123
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,126
Really

124
00:06:01,126 --> 00:06:02,668
I swear on the fifty thousand yuan,

125
00:06:05,793 --> 00:06:06,168
a row

126
00:06:06,168 --> 00:06:06,710
good

127
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:07,793
With your words,

128
00:06:07,793 --> 00:06:08,501
Mom, wait.

129
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,626
Wait and see.

130
00:06:09,626 --> 00:06:10,418
What's wrong?

131
00:06:11,251 --> 00:06:11,626
My dad

132
00:06:11,626 --> 00:06:12,460
What did my dad take?

133
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,335
No matter what,

134
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:17,001
Tell me if you have it.

135
00:06:28,876 --> 00:06:29,751
son

136
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:31,126
You won the honor for our family.

137
00:06:31,293 --> 00:06:32,876
I have nothing to give you.

138
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:34,710
This is for you.

139
00:06:36,335 --> 00:06:37,043
this

140
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:39,251
Isn't it the one you confiscated when I was young?

141
00:06:39,835 --> 00:06:41,085
Actually,

142
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,668
I want you to be

143
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,126
Who makes others think highly of him.

144
00:06:44,376 --> 00:06:45,918
For our generation,

145
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:47,460
To enter the national unit.

146
00:06:47,626 --> 00:06:48,918
And take an iron rice bowl.

147
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:50,376
There's a guaranteed salary.

148
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,376
Even if it makes people think highly of it,

149
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:54,460
But times have changed.

150
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,793
Although I don't know much about games,

151
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:59,251
But I can see it from you.

152
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:00,918
This is serious.

153
00:07:01,085 --> 00:07:02,335
As long as you're successful,

154
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:03,626
Is respected as well.

155
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:04,418
same

156
00:07:04,835 --> 00:07:07,335
To be appreciated by others.

157
00:07:07,793 --> 00:07:09,668
Dad, take back what you said.

158
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:11,501
It's my fault.

159
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:25,710
It can ring.

160
00:07:45,585 --> 00:07:46,751
First, let's welcome

We also have

The other two teams

171
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:06,210
They are Hey Shout Team.

172
00:08:08,668 --> 00:08:10,835
A lot of friends know about it.

173
00:08:10,835 --> 00:08:12,460
They are in the Tencent e-sports competition.

174

00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:15,835
Yes

177
00:08:15,835 --> 00:08:17,668
The other team that stood out

178
00:08:17,668 --> 00:08:18,543
They are our

179
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:20,210
Southern monster

180
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:21,626
to ask sb in

181
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,168
Southern Monsters Team.

182
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:24,751
In the whole Tencent e-sports sports league,

183
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:26,793
Was always at the bottom.

184
00:08:27,168 --> 00:08:28,626
But after a big change,

185
00:08:28,626 --> 00:08:30,043
Like a sudden appearance.

186
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,418
And fought out the encirclement like a dark horse.

187
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:35,210
It's great to get the result today.

188
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:35,918
We are also looking forward to

189
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:38,085
They can achieve another success in the competition.

190
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:40,001
Okay, let me introduce to you.

191
00:08:40,001 --> 00:08:41,751
The rules of this season.

192
00:08:41,835 --> 00:08:43,335
Ten Crossfire Professional League teams.

193
00:08:43,335 --> 00:08:44,668
To each other.

194
00:08:44,668 --> 00:08:45,960
After nine rounds of battle,

195
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,126
Eight teams will enter the playoffs.

196
00:08:48,126 --> 00:08:49,751
The champion of Crossfire Professional League,

197
00:08:49,751 --> 00:08:52,501
Will win the exclusive customized champion weapon suit.

198
00:08:52,501 --> 00:08:54,418
Please pay attention to the follow-up competition.

199
00:08:54,418 --> 00:08:56,335
This is the end of today's press conference.

200
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:56,668
Thank you

201
00:08:56,668 --> 00:08:57,335
President Guo.

202
00:08:57,626 --> 00:08:59,376
What do you think of the press conference?

203
00:08:59,376 --> 00:09:00,001
It's great.

204
00:09:00,876 --> 00:09:02,460
They left one after another.

205
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,668
Xiao Bei, I've seen him.

206
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,376
Excuse me, make way.

207
00:09:08,126 --> 00:09:09,460
Xiaobei

208
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,710
Take it easy.

209
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:12,668
Come here

210
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:14,126
fast

211
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:15,543
I've been in love with you for a long time.

212
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:17,335
Come and say hello to the babies.

213
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:19,960
Hello, everyone.

214
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,293
I'm the captain of the Southern Monster, Lu Xiabei.

215
00:09:23,168 --> 00:09:24,085
So handsome.

216
00:09:24,585 --> 00:09:26,001
Hello, this is Ding Ding.

217
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:27,168
I really like your tactics.

218
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:29,043
This old tactic made you fight.

219
00:09:29,043 --> 00:09:31,418
Super innovative.

220
00:09:32,085 --> 00:09:32,793
Thank you.

221
00:09:33,918 --> 00:09:34,793
I'm so happy.

222
00:09:34,793 --> 00:09:36,210
Let's compete with each other.

223
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,626
Please support the southern monster.

224
00:09:42,251 --> 00:09:43,835
Come on

225
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,793
Together.

226
00:09:48,251 --> 00:09:49,460
And play games together.

227
00:09:49,793 --> 00:09:50,293
Thank you

228
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:51,043
Bye

229
00:09:53,876 --> 00:09:54,293
Hurry up.

230
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:55,793
There are two in the middle.

231
00:09:55,793 --> 00:09:56,293
He's here.

232
00:09:56,293 --> 00:09:56,918
Received

233
00:09:57,876 --> 00:09:58,751
One off.

234
00:09:58,751 --> 00:09:59,168
pretty

235
00:10:00,626 --> 00:10:01,501
I dropped it.

236
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,751
There are two in Warehouse B.

237
00:10:04,168 --> 00:10:04,501
I dropped it.

238
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:05,418
Warehouse B, right?

239
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,418
I dropped it at point B.

240
00:10:07,418 --> 00:10:08,585
There's another Wang Kai in Warehouse B.

241
00:10:09,585 --> 00:10:10,126
I dropped it too.

242
00:10:13,626 --> 00:10:14,126
Come on.

243
00:10:14,126 --> 00:10:14,918
Nice gun.

244
00:10:14,918 --> 00:10:15,626
Okay, I'll help.

245
00:10:15,626 --> 00:10:16,085
On the way,

246
00:10:16,293 --> 00:10:17,251
A little.

247
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:18,085
You're in.

248
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:18,668
It's white.

249
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:19,043
It fell off.

250
00:10:19,043 --> 00:10:20,126
A is small.

251
00:10:24,293 --> 00:10:24,876
I dropped it.

252
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:27,960
The champion of Tencent Esports Games.

253
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,793
The Monster of the Southern Wind is not acclimatized.

254
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:30,918
Were severely restrained.

255
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:32,293
Yes, the feeling is limited.

256
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,543
Especially their captain, Lu Xiaobai.

257
00:10:34,543 --> 00:10:35,668
Has been held down and beaten.

258
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,085
So the situation hasn't been opened yet.

259
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:37,626
That's right.

260
00:10:38,668 --> 00:10:39,751
A little.

261
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:40,501
The middle door came in.

262
00:10:40,501 --> 00:10:41,418
To rearm with me.

263
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,585
A small outcrop.

264
00:10:44,793 --> 00:10:45,085
I

265
00:10:48,793 --> 00:10:49,751
Congratulations to the Ing team.

266
00:10:49,751 --> 00:10:50,960
The next game is 10-3.

267
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,043
To win this game.

268
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:04,585
I'll do it.

269
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:05,876
No need

270
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:12,543
I'm not mad at you.

271
00:11:12,835 --> 00:11:13,501
I know.

272
00:11:22,085 --> 00:11:23,543
I'm not myself today.

273
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
The first few shots

274
00:11:25,293 --> 00:11:26,251
You shouldn't have missed it.

275
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,085
You have worked hard enough.

276
00:11:29,085 --> 00:11:30,335
People are not machines.

277
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:32,335
Who can guarantee that every hand is hot?

278
00:11:32,335 --> 00:11:33,085
is or isn't

279
00:11:34,376 --> 00:11:35,376
It's so weird.

280
00:11:35,876 --> 00:11:38,126
The same spot has been searched for two rounds.

281
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,710
Why did you attack that point?

282
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:41,376
They came for you.

283
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:42,543
Didn't you notice that?

284
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,335
The two games I lost were like this.

285
00:11:44,335 --> 00:11:45,876
As soon as you came out, they targeted you.

286
00:11:46,668 --> 00:11:48,460
They want to strangle you.

287
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,251
And then come after us.

288
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:51,710
Yes

289
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:53,043
Like a bunch of rabid dogs.

290
00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:53,668
Wherever you go,

291
00:11:53,668 --> 00:11:54,626
They followed him everywhere.

292
00:11:54,793 --> 00:11:55,543
That's right.

293
00:11:55,543 --> 00:11:57,043
When you're in good shape, you can...

294
00:11:57,043 --> 00:11:58,335
Two, three.

295
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,501
But I can't stand you. You can do it every round.

296
00:12:00,668 --> 00:12:01,543
The way you feel,

297
00:12:01,543 --> 00:12:02,918
That's how I was beaten.

298
00:12:03,043 --> 00:12:03,710
Besides,

299
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,876
No matter how strong you are,

300
00:12:04,876 --> 00:12:06,168
Can't hold two or three people.

301
00:12:06,168 --> 00:12:07,501
Around him, right?

302
00:12:09,793 --> 00:12:11,210
You were getting worse and worse.

303
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,418
I've been sweating for you.

304
00:12:12,876 --> 00:12:14,293
When I saw the captain fall,

305
00:12:14,293 --> 00:12:15,501
I was so nervous.

306
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:16,626
I can't hold my gun.

307
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,543
You can't blame Xiao Bei.

308
00:12:19,543 --> 00:12:22,043
He's the Monster of the South.

309
00:12:22,418 --> 00:12:23,793
I'm not a sign now.

310
00:12:24,085 --> 00:12:25,543
Has been beaten into a human target.

311
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,043
Didn't President Guo say that

312
00:12:27,043 --> 00:12:28,793
Get us technical guidance?

313
00:12:28,793 --> 00:12:30,043
There's no sign of him.

314
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,126
Forget it.

315
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:33,210
He can replace our cook aunt.

316
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,210
I kowtow to him.

317
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:40,710
Beyond reality.

318
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,001
Experience the future.

319
00:12:42,293 --> 00:12:44,710
Welcome to VG Global Games.

320
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,251
The newly developed Zero Time Game project.

321
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,876
In this game,

322
00:12:48,876 --> 00:12:49,835
You will feel

323
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,126
The Unbounded Combination of Virtual and Reality

324
00:12:52,126 --> 00:12:53,585
Our game equipment

325
00:12:53,585 --> 00:12:55,793
Has entered the new product promotion stage.

326
00:12:55,793 --> 00:12:57,835
A rich reward is waiting for you.

327
00:12:57,835 --> 00:12:59,626
Enjoy your game.

328
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,501
Mr. Xu,

329
00:13:00,501 --> 00:13:02,918
Congratulations on winning your first national championship.

330
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:04,751
Our new game equipment test

331
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,001
I really need someone like you.

332
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:07,668
Professionals to complete

333
00:13:07,668 --> 00:13:08,835
Only half a day.

334
00:13:08,835 --> 00:13:10,043
The labor cost is 10,000 yuan.

335
00:13:10,043 --> 00:13:11,710
If we have deep cooperation in the future,

336
00:13:12,168 --> 00:13:13,543
We'll talk about the cost.

337
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,710
Didn't you say on the phone that

338
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,126
Can help professionals improve their skills?

339
00:13:18,126 --> 00:13:19,043
Yes

340
00:13:19,043 --> 00:13:19,918
Especially for

341
00:13:19,918 --> 00:13:22,501
The professional player of the first-person shooting game.

342
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,543
We can enter the previous match data.

343
00:13:24,793 --> 00:13:27,126
And set the difficulty according to the specific situation.

344
00:13:27,293 --> 00:13:28,001
therefore

345
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:31,168
So I want to invite champions like you.

346
00:13:31,168 --> 00:13:32,460
To experience it.

347
00:13:33,168 --> 00:13:33,585
to speak the truth

348
00:13:33,585 --> 00:13:35,168
I didn't understand it before.

349
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,876
How do you play games with your consciousness?

350
00:13:39,335 --> 00:13:39,710
please

351
00:13:48,751 --> 00:13:49,376
please

352
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,335
This is the control room.

353
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,876
This is the equipment.

354
00:14:01,876 --> 00:14:04,835
It connects directly with the human neuronal system.

355
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:05,793
before

356
00:14:05,793 --> 00:14:07,210
We use the game controller.

357
00:14:07,668 --> 00:14:08,501
To control the character.

358
00:14:08,835 --> 00:14:10,835
The most powerful thing about this device

359
00:14:10,835 --> 00:14:12,585
It can transfer people's consciousness

360
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:13,793
Into a data stream.

361
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:15,501
Get into the game.

362
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:16,668
to put it simply

363
00:14:16,668 --> 00:14:18,501
You can use your consciousness

364
00:14:19,085 --> 00:14:20,251
Use your consciousness directly.

365
00:14:20,876 --> 00:14:22,501
To control the characters.

366
00:14:23,668 --> 00:14:24,376
Namely

367
00:14:25,126 --> 00:14:28,210
I have the same character.

368
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,168
You're right.

369
00:14:34,085 --> 00:14:35,210
Mr. Xu, look.

370
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,001
Take these two

371
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,376
On your temple.

372
00:14:38,793 --> 00:14:41,043
Then you can lie here.

373
00:14:41,335 --> 00:14:42,918
To enjoy your game.

374
00:14:44,335 --> 00:14:44,876
Please sit down.

375
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,501
Is it dangerous?

376
00:14:50,626 --> 00:14:51,335
I won't.

377
00:14:51,751 --> 00:14:52,501
Very safe.

378
00:14:52,668 --> 00:14:55,001
When your character dies,

379
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,376
Your consciousness

380
00:14:56,376 --> 00:14:57,960
Will instantly return to your brain.

381
00:14:58,293 --> 00:14:58,918
and

382
00:14:58,918 --> 00:15:01,168
We will monitor your vital signs in real time.

383
00:15:03,043 --> 00:15:03,626
please

384
00:15:07,293 --> 00:15:08,335
Are you ready to experience it?

385
00:15:08,668 --> 00:15:09,293
Mr. Xu,

386
00:15:10,293 --> 00:15:11,501
Enjoy your game.

387
00:15:43,668 --> 00:15:44,626
Mr. Xu,

388
00:15:44,626 --> 00:15:47,293
We will use the GPS receiver on your back

389
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:49,918
Monitor all your data information in real time

390
00:15:49,918 --> 00:15:51,668
Please take care of it.

391
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:16,793
Mr. Xu, can you hear me?

392
00:17:16,793 --> 00:17:17,793
How are you feeling?

393
00:17:17,793 --> 00:17:18,960
It's quite real.

394
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,168
But it's not that difficult.

395
00:17:20,793 --> 00:17:22,585
The difficulty lies behind.

396
00:17:22,585 --> 00:17:23,168
behind

397
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:43,876
It's not that difficult.

398
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:45,835
The excitement will come soon.

399
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:49,376
Through this door,

400
00:17:49,376 --> 00:17:50,751
The game world you entered

401
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:52,626
Will be completely created by your consciousness.

402
00:17:53,126 --> 00:17:54,085
in other words

403
00:17:54,085 --> 00:17:55,960
The scene you saw and the opponent

404
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,710
Is the reflection of your consciousness.

405
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,168
Your world of consciousness

406
00:17:59,168 --> 00:18:01,293
Will be displayed in front of you.

407
00:18:01,293 --> 00:18:02,460
Enjoy your game.

408
00:19:19,168 --> 00:19:22,126
Players enter the uncontrollable zone.

409
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:22,918
What happened

410
00:19:22,918 --> 00:19:24,085
Check the fault immediately.

411
00:19:24,418 --> 00:19:25,876
Mr. Xu,

412
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:26,543
Can you hear me?

413
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,543
The player's game space has been blocked by the system.

414
00:19:43,543 --> 00:19:45,001
Currently unable to complete fault investigation.

415
00:19:46,751 --> 00:19:47,835
Figure out a way.

416
00:19:47,835 --> 00:19:49,626
We must ensure Mr. Xu's absolute safety.

417
00:20:02,793 --> 00:20:03,501
Mr. Xu,

418
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:04,043
How are you?

419
00:20:04,293 --> 00:20:04,876
Can you hear me?

420
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,960
His vital signs have dropped significantly.

421
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,376
It's recommended to force the downline to cut off.

422
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:13,668
But the player is in the conscious control zone.

423
00:20:13,835 --> 00:20:15,418
I can't guarantee full recovery of consciousness.

424
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:24,835
His vital signs are disappearing.

425
00:20:33,626 --> 00:20:34,835
The location can't be traced.

426
00:20:45,168 --> 00:20:46,293
Player Data Recovery

427
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:52,168
Mr. Xu, are you all right?

428
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:53,418
Fortunately, you came back in time.

429
00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:55,376
We almost started to force the offline.

430
00:20:55,376 --> 00:20:56,460
What happened just now?

431
00:20:56,918 --> 00:20:59,460
You disappeared from the screen.

432
00:21:07,168 --> 00:21:07,793
this

433
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:09,793
What's going on?

434
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:13,668
Before,

435
00:21:13,668 --> 00:21:15,251
Has never happened before.

436
00:21:15,376 --> 00:21:16,293
sorry

437
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,085
Did I die in the game?

438
00:21:22,501 --> 00:21:24,460
In reality, I can't survive.

439
00:21:26,543 --> 00:21:27,960
It won't happen again.

440
00:21:28,668 --> 00:21:29,710
Give me the money.

441
00:22:39,876 --> 00:22:42,335
To the most handsome captain in the world.

442
00:22:45,876 --> 00:22:46,835
Open it and have a look.

443
00:22:52,126 --> 00:22:53,793
My female fans are pretty.

444
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,460
Look.

445
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:57,835
And left a WeChat account.

446
00:22:59,293 --> 00:23:00,418
It's beautiful.

447
00:23:02,585 --> 00:23:03,210
sour grapes

448
00:23:03,418 --> 00:23:03,835
Correct!

449
00:23:04,376 --> 00:23:05,918
What about those private messages on Weibo?

450
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:06,835
I wrote back for you.

451
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:08,168
To save you time.

452
00:23:08,376 --> 00:23:09,168
why

453
00:23:09,335 --> 00:23:11,543
The fans just expressed their love for me.

454
00:23:11,876 --> 00:23:12,835
That's great.

455
00:23:12,835 --> 00:23:14,001
She's gone back.

456
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,168
High school students know what love is.

457
00:23:16,168 --> 00:23:17,793
I'm telling them to recognize the reality.

458
00:23:18,168 --> 00:23:19,085
please!

459
00:23:19,085 --> 00:23:20,251
You're only a freshman, okay?

460
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:23,626
wrong

461
00:23:26,293 --> 00:23:27,251
Are you jealous?

462
00:23:27,585 --> 00:23:28,168
I didn't.

463
00:23:32,793 --> 00:23:35,376
A fan asked me to have afternoon tea this afternoon.

464
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,460
I

465
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:37,626
Can I go?

466
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:38,251
Don't go there.

467
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:39,876
why

468
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:41,460
man

469
00:23:41,585 --> 00:23:42,543
Not even a man.

470
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,918
Not even a man.

471
00:23:43,918 --> 00:23:45,543
Of course, you have to train.

472
00:23:45,543 --> 00:23:46,585
We lost two games.

473
00:23:46,585 --> 00:23:47,460
I don't know.

474
00:23:47,835 --> 00:23:48,960
There's no time to practice.

475
00:23:49,543 --> 00:23:51,335
Now all the teams have studied me thoroughly.

476
00:23:52,043 --> 00:23:53,085
Who asked you to be brave?

477
00:23:53,085 --> 00:23:53,793
When the sky falls,

478
00:23:53,793 --> 00:23:54,960
You have to take it on yourself.

479
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,793
You're not the only one.

480
00:23:55,793 --> 00:23:57,043
To save the world.

481
00:24:02,168 --> 00:24:03,168
You're so right.

482
00:24:04,918 --> 00:24:05,543
Chu song

483
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,210
You are an angel.

484
00:24:10,876 --> 00:24:11,876
You're really an angel.

485
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,710
Where are you going?

486
00:24:15,668 --> 00:24:16,418
training

487
00:24:16,876 --> 00:24:17,376
I'm telling you,

488
00:24:17,376 --> 00:24:18,460
Don't try to date secretly.

489
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,126
I found a solution.

490
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,710
Now all the teams are targeting me.

491
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,710
Because I'm the main attacker.

492
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:23,668
And knocked me off.

493
00:24:23,668 --> 00:24:25,751
It's like killing half of our tactical possibilities.

494
00:24:25,751 --> 00:24:27,293
So now your solution is...

495
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:28,835
WangKai

496
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:30,835
Take my place.

497
00:24:31,043 --> 00:24:32,043
I retreated to the swimming position.

498
00:24:32,043 --> 00:24:33,043
To fill your seats.

499
00:24:33,418 --> 00:24:34,043
I

500
00:24:34,835 --> 00:24:35,460
Xiaobei

501
00:24:35,668 --> 00:24:36,793
Are you really going to give up yourself?

502
00:24:36,793 --> 00:24:38,418
The best style and position.

503
00:24:38,835 --> 00:24:39,626
In this world,

504
00:24:39,626 --> 00:24:40,418
Besides winning,

505
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,960
Nothing can't be given up.

506
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,001
How about Wang Kai?

507
00:24:43,001 --> 00:24:44,085
Can he play the main attack?

508
00:24:44,085 --> 00:24:45,168
Who said I can't?

509
00:24:45,168 --> 00:24:46,793
I'm born to play the main attack.

510
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:47,751
brother

511
00:24:48,085 --> 00:24:49,501
Don't pretend to be fat.

512
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,585
What's your record?

513
00:24:50,585 --> 00:24:51,918
I don't know.

514
00:24:51,918 --> 00:24:53,501
That's because he always makes a breakthrough.

515
00:24:53,501 --> 00:24:54,626
To the front.

516
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,168
I support Xiao Bei's idea.

517
00:24:56,168 --> 00:24:58,335
I think Wang Kai has the potential to attack.

518
00:24:59,043 --> 00:25:00,168
I think so too.

519
00:25:00,168 --> 00:25:01,085
Brother Kai can handle it.

520
00:25:01,085 --> 00:25:02,293
learn to walk before you run

521
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,501
But the fatty must come out with one bite.

522
00:25:04,918 --> 00:25:06,001
From now on,

523
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,543
We'll take turns feeding you the gun.

524
00:25:09,418 --> 00:25:10,626
Didn't they break up?

525
00:25:10,626 --> 00:25:11,168
What's going on?

526
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,293
Wang Kai, come on.

527
00:25:16,126 --> 00:25:17,418
The world of adults.

528
00:25:17,626 --> 00:25:18,376
It's complicated.

529
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,043
Kai

530
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,168
Move.

531
00:25:28,168 --> 00:25:29,543
Don't let the opponent lock your position.

532
00:25:29,543 --> 00:25:30,001
Received

533
00:25:32,876 --> 00:25:33,501
WangKai

534
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:34,876
Don't rush to grab the head.

535
00:25:34,876 --> 00:25:36,210
You should have a bigger picture.

536
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,085
The overall situation.

537
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:38,168
Sometimes in life,

538
00:25:38,501 --> 00:25:39,918
Is more important than changing.

539
00:25:41,251 --> 00:25:41,793
Come on.

540
00:26:05,835 --> 00:26:06,501
Xiaobei

541
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,543
Talk to him.

542
00:26:07,543 --> 00:26:08,710
Look at him. He's going crazy.

543
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,126
What if he breaks his body?

544
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,126
WangKai

545
00:26:12,126 --> 00:26:12,960
What are you doing?

546
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,501
Is this your strength?

547
00:26:14,501 --> 00:26:15,335
Are you sleepy?

548
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:17,293
If you're sleepy, go to bed.

549
00:26:17,293 --> 00:26:18,585
Don't waste our time.

550
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,543
You are the main attacker now.

551
00:26:20,543 --> 00:26:21,626
We should take a holistic view.

552
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,585
The overall situation.

553
00:26:22,585 --> 00:26:23,501
Are you good or not?

554
00:26:23,585 --> 00:26:24,126
Come on.

555
00:26:24,335 --> 00:26:24,960
Come on.

556
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,043
Thank you.

557
00:26:37,376 --> 00:26:38,543
What does it feel like to play the main role?

558
00:26:38,751 --> 00:26:39,501
It's hard.

559
00:26:40,918 --> 00:26:41,918
You have to take care of everyone.

560
00:26:43,876 --> 00:26:45,210
Isn't this the video of my competition?

561
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:45,751
That's right.

562
00:26:46,085 --> 00:26:47,043
To study.

563
00:26:49,376 --> 00:26:50,543
I want you to attack.

564
00:26:51,085 --> 00:26:52,335
I'm not asking you to imitate me.

565
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:53,585
And become the second me.

566
00:26:54,043 --> 00:26:55,585
I want you to be the best

567
00:26:55,793 --> 00:26:57,335
To create more tactical possibilities.

568
00:26:58,918 --> 00:26:59,876
You know what?

569
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:01,668
Actually, in the team,

570
00:27:01,918 --> 00:27:03,668
Your marksmanship is better than Cheng Hao.

571
00:27:04,001 --> 00:27:04,960
The second last.

572
00:27:05,168 --> 00:27:06,001
Or sit still.

573
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:08,335
Then why did you choose me?

574
00:27:08,876 --> 00:27:11,001
But you're the most flexible.

575
00:27:11,585 --> 00:27:13,043
Especially in the endgame.

576
00:27:13,043 --> 00:27:14,460
On decisiveness and ferocity,

577
00:27:14,918 --> 00:27:16,168
No one can compete with you.

578
00:27:17,876 --> 00:27:18,960
You can practice your marksmanship.

579
00:27:19,918 --> 00:27:20,835
But this...

580
00:27:21,668 --> 00:27:22,668
It's a gift.

581
00:27:26,335 --> 00:27:27,335
What should I do?

582
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,710
You want to be a new Wang Kai.

583
00:27:34,585 --> 00:27:35,210
Cheng Hao, Nezha.

584
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,293
Attack A with me.

585
00:27:36,293 --> 00:27:36,918
Received, received.

586
00:27:39,835 --> 00:27:40,585
There's one in the computer room.

587
00:27:40,585 --> 00:27:40,960
pretty

588
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,626
Nice gun.

589
00:27:42,418 --> 00:27:43,418
The middle case is exposed.

590
00:27:43,418 --> 00:27:44,293
That's nice. Nice gun.

591
00:27:44,293 --> 00:27:45,335
Don't worry.

592
00:27:45,335 --> 00:27:46,501
Clean it first, then I'll pack it.

593
00:27:51,876 --> 00:27:52,876
How to hit you?

594
00:27:53,293 --> 00:27:54,710
Our Kai seems to have an explosion.

595
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,543
That's right.

596
00:27:55,543 --> 00:27:56,835
The Southern Monster's firing point.

597
00:27:56,835 --> 00:27:58,168
Always the captain, North.

598
00:27:58,168 --> 00:27:58,793
Here's the thing.

599
00:27:58,793 --> 00:28:00,668
But the Southern Monster's tactical arrangement

600
00:28:00,668 --> 00:28:01,668
It's different from what it used to be.

601
00:28:01,918 --> 00:28:02,960
Based on the current situation,

602
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,376
The victory of the southern monster is in the bag.

603
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,293
Two.

604
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:07,085
Nice gun.

605
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:07,710
pretty

606
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,501
pretty

607
00:28:11,751 --> 00:28:12,876
Congratulations to the southern monster.

608
00:28:12,876 --> 00:28:14,918
The first victory of the regular season of the Crossfire Professional League.

609
00:28:15,251 --> 00:28:15,710
WangKai

610
00:28:16,293 --> 00:28:17,085
I love you so much.

611
00:28:18,793 --> 00:28:19,335
Let's go.

612
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,126
The first victory of Crossfire Professional League.

613
00:28:21,126 --> 00:28:23,293
It's our turn to shake hands today.

614
00:28:30,585 --> 00:28:32,793
Xiaobei

615
00:28:33,043 --> 00:28:33,918
I'm Ding Ding.

616
00:28:34,251 --> 00:28:36,460
You played really well today.

617
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:36,876
Except for you.

618
00:28:36,876 --> 00:28:38,418
I'll only give ten to the others.

619
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:39,501
indeed

620
00:28:39,835 --> 00:28:41,501
I didn't play well today.

621
00:28:42,001 --> 00:28:44,543
I'm really good without you.

622
00:28:44,543 --> 00:28:46,626
How about you? I'll definitely score 100 points.

623
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,168
Your change is too bold.

624
00:28:49,168 --> 00:28:51,085
To give up the main position.

625
00:28:51,835 --> 00:28:53,043
I have something to do. I'm leaving.

626
00:29:16,126 --> 00:29:16,751
to take a look at

627
00:29:17,251 --> 00:29:18,835
I've paid the deposit.

628
00:29:19,001 --> 00:29:19,960
Starting from tomorrow,

629
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,501
This is the headquarters of the Steel Coin Team.

630
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:26,085
Luxury houses.

631
00:29:27,251 --> 00:29:27,876
What about

632
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:30,751
Oh, My God

633
00:29:31,376 --> 00:29:31,668
can

634
00:29:31,668 --> 00:29:33,043
It's definitely not cheap.

635
00:29:33,043 --> 00:29:34,501
There is also a sea view room.

636
00:29:34,751 --> 00:29:36,501
Wow.

637
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,251
Such a balcony.

638
00:29:38,251 --> 00:29:40,043
There's also a river-view house.

639
00:29:43,043 --> 00:29:44,543
The birds and the guns have changed.

640
00:29:45,626 --> 00:29:46,085
What about

641
00:29:46,293 --> 00:29:47,376
You can fish.

642
00:29:48,001 --> 00:29:48,626
Is he powerful?

643
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:49,876
very good

644
00:29:49,876 --> 00:29:50,501
Xiao Feng.

645
00:29:50,501 --> 00:29:52,168
Should we change our name?

646
00:29:52,168 --> 00:29:54,793
It's too stingy to call the Steel Coin Team.

647
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:55,710
No way

648
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,585
Although our life is good now,

649
00:29:57,585 --> 00:29:58,293
Don't forget your origin.

650
00:29:58,293 --> 00:30:00,543
I'm also in favor of continuing to use the name Gangfen Team.

651
00:30:00,543 --> 00:30:02,126
This is our brand.

652
00:30:02,126 --> 00:30:02,626
Yes

653
00:30:02,626 --> 00:30:03,710
Cut the crap.

654
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:04,668
I'm just asking.

655
00:30:04,876 --> 00:30:06,001
Where do I live?

656
00:30:06,001 --> 00:30:07,085
This place is not inhabited.

657
00:30:07,085 --> 00:30:08,043
This is not our dormitory.

658
00:30:08,043 --> 00:30:09,376
Such a good house can't be occupied.

659
00:30:09,376 --> 00:30:10,501
It's so wasteful.

660
00:30:10,501 --> 00:30:11,210
It's not a waste.

661
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,085
I've thought about it.

662
00:30:12,168 --> 00:30:14,418
We only use this place as a training room.

663
00:30:14,418 --> 00:30:15,085
Besides

664
00:30:15,085 --> 00:30:16,918
I'll look for teams all over the country.

665
00:30:16,918 --> 00:30:17,668
And draw him in.

666
00:30:17,668 --> 00:30:19,001
To form an alliance.

667
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:20,126
And then get the sponsor.

668
00:30:20,126 --> 00:30:21,668
To get the league together.

669
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,918
Is that like a football league?

670
00:30:24,918 --> 00:30:25,335
Yes

671
00:30:25,543 --> 00:30:27,751
Only by taking one step at a time, can we be on the right track.

672
00:30:28,918 --> 00:30:31,501
And thousands of rooms.

673
00:30:31,501 --> 00:30:34,793
To shelter the whole world.

674
00:30:39,085 --> 00:30:40,043
Don't be too happy.

675
00:30:40,043 --> 00:30:40,918
Brothers,

676
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,960
Wake up. Stop dreaming.

677
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,876
This is not a dream.

678
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:45,960
All my dreams have come true.

679
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,710
This time,

680
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,335
I want to have a bigger dream.

681
00:30:48,918 --> 00:30:49,960
arrogant

682
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,335
To be strong.

683
00:30:51,335 --> 00:31:02,293
Bigger and stronger.

684
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:03,376
The signal is not good.

685
00:31:03,376 --> 00:31:04,501
I'm going to answer the phone.

686
00:31:04,501 --> 00:31:05,001
Go.

687
00:31:05,001 --> 00:31:05,668
This watch is good.

688
00:31:05,876 --> 00:31:07,335
Let's check the room.

689
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,585
I'll take you to a restaurant later.

690
00:31:13,585 --> 00:31:14,668
How about a good noodle restaurant?

691
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,626
I have an oral English class tonight.

692
00:31:20,835 --> 00:31:21,543
another day

693
00:31:21,543 --> 00:31:23,085
Okay, it's okay.

694
00:31:23,501 --> 00:31:24,460
I'll take you there another time.

695
00:31:25,085 --> 00:31:26,418
Is very delicious.

696
00:31:26,501 --> 00:31:27,335
Really?

697
00:31:38,126 --> 00:31:39,793
He won the national championship.

698
00:31:40,626 --> 00:31:41,793
It's pretty.

699
00:31:42,043 --> 00:31:42,960
What are you doing?

700
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,835
There's more.

701
00:31:44,043 --> 00:31:45,376
It must be over.

702
00:31:45,751 --> 00:31:46,835
Just a little bit.

703
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,626
Give me another 20,000 yuan.

704
00:31:48,876 --> 00:31:50,126
I promise to disappear from here.

705
00:31:50,126 --> 00:31:51,335
And never called you again.

706
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,293
I didn't come to you.

707
00:31:52,501 --> 00:31:53,751
I really don't have any money.

708
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,126
It's okay if you don't give it to me.

709
00:31:56,043 --> 00:31:58,085
I'll call your buddy right now.

710
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,668
They must have done terrible things to you.

711
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:01,668
Interested in it.

712
00:32:02,793 --> 00:32:04,085
Can you give me a way out?

713
00:32:04,085 --> 00:32:05,585
It took me a long time to get here.

714
00:32:05,585 --> 00:32:06,543
I beg you.

715
00:32:07,001 --> 00:32:07,668
My mother.

716
00:32:07,668 --> 00:32:08,460
The champion.

717
00:32:08,668 --> 00:32:10,335
The national champion is 20,000 yuan.

718
00:32:10,335 --> 00:32:11,210
Is that necessary?

719
00:32:12,126 --> 00:32:13,501
If you don't want to, fine.

720
00:32:13,501 --> 00:32:14,460
I'm calling your buddy now.

721
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,751
I'm not asking for it.

722
00:32:17,085 --> 00:32:18,376
Can you stop calling?

723
00:32:18,376 --> 00:32:19,876
Can I beg you not to call?

724
00:32:19,876 --> 00:32:20,710
Untie me.

725
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,418
Are you going to kill me?

726
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,543
I'm telling you, Xu Wei,

727
00:32:28,543 --> 00:32:29,751
You want to give me the money today?

728
00:32:29,751 --> 00:32:30,793
That's it.

729
00:32:30,793 --> 00:32:32,585
If you don't give it to me, I will fool you forever.

730
00:32:32,585 --> 00:32:34,085
I'll fool your friend forever.

731
00:32:39,335 --> 00:32:39,960
What do you mean?

732
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:41,668
I'll take you there.

733
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,710
This is the last time.

734
00:32:43,918 --> 00:32:45,626
Wouldn't that be the end?

735
00:32:45,626 --> 00:32:46,376
Let's go.

736
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:47,835
Get the money.

737
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:21,585
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

738
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:22,335
Please wait a moment.

739
00:33:36,793 --> 00:33:37,210
Lieutenant

740
00:33:38,168 --> 00:33:38,751
Lieutenant

741
00:33:42,418 --> 00:33:43,626
Captain, open the door.

742
00:33:43,626 --> 00:33:45,460
I hear you inside. Open the door.

743
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:56,710
What happened to your face?

744
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:57,501
Nothing

745
00:33:57,793 --> 00:33:58,793
Did Cao Lei do it?

746
00:33:59,501 --> 00:34:00,168
No

747
00:34:00,668 --> 00:34:01,376
Xiao Feng.

748
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:02,751
I'm feeling a bit sick today.

749
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:03,793
Go back first.

750
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,460
I saw you burning something.

751
00:34:41,376 --> 00:34:42,501
Why are you burning clothes?

752
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,751
Why is there blood on the watch?

753
00:34:58,918 --> 00:35:00,293
Shouldn't Cao Lei have this?

754
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,710
Xiao Feng.

755
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,085
Can you stay out of my business?

756
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:12,960
I'm telling you, Captain,

757
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,126
Don't do this to me.

758
00:35:14,126 --> 00:35:15,710
I don't care who cares about your business.

759
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,460
Can you be honest with me?

760
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,918
Why is the watch not leaving?

761
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,043
Lieutenant

762
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,168
No matter what happens,

763
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,418
You should be a man first.

764
00:35:32,126 --> 00:35:34,418
If you can't do it well, you'll be unable to do anything.

765
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,668
Have we suffered a lot before?

766
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:37,460
Tell me.

767
00:35:38,418 --> 00:35:39,668
Why is there blood on this watch?

768
00:35:39,918 --> 00:35:41,085
Why did you burn the clothes?

769
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,835
Why would Cao Lei turn off his phone?

770
00:35:43,668 --> 00:35:44,626
He scolded me.

771
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,001
I won't answer back.

772
00:35:47,626 --> 00:35:48,668
He hit me.

773
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:50,210
I didn't fight back.

774
00:35:50,335 --> 00:35:51,793
What's your problem?

775
00:35:51,793 --> 00:35:53,001
Can't we solve it properly?

776
00:35:53,001 --> 00:35:54,001
Just for money.

777
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:55,710
He was peeing on my head.

778
00:35:56,293 --> 00:35:57,251
He wants to kill me.

779
00:35:57,251 --> 00:35:58,043
Should I bear it?

780
00:35:58,043 --> 00:35:59,418
He's a scoundrel.

781
00:36:00,293 --> 00:36:01,876
Do you want to be like him?

782
00:36:02,168 --> 00:36:03,460
What's the difference between you and him?

783
00:36:03,585 --> 00:36:06,085
Tell me what happened.

784
00:36:12,918 --> 00:36:14,043
He's dead.

785
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:16,376
What did you say

786
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,835
He's dead.

787
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,918
I killed him by mistake.

788
00:36:29,793 --> 00:36:30,876
Turn yourself in now.

789
00:36:31,126 --> 00:36:31,668
immediately

790
00:36:31,668 --> 00:36:32,751
I can't go.

791
00:36:33,168 --> 00:36:34,626
If I go, I'll lose everything.

792
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,293
So that you can be lenient.

793
00:36:37,293 --> 00:36:38,710
You can't repeat your mistake.

794
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:40,585
Xiao Feng.

795
00:36:41,168 --> 00:36:41,751
Calm down.

796
00:36:41,751 --> 00:36:42,543
Listen to me.

797
00:36:42,835 --> 00:36:44,543
It took us a long time to get here.

798
00:36:44,543 --> 00:36:46,085
To live a good life.

799
00:36:46,085 --> 00:36:47,585
If I go there, I'll be finished.

800
00:36:47,793 --> 00:36:49,168
No one knows about it.

801
00:36:50,001 --> 00:36:50,751
Don't say that, okay?

802
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:52,168
Just pretend it never happened.

803
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,210
Can you help me?

804
00:36:53,293 --> 00:36:54,126
Don't say that.

805
00:36:54,376 --> 00:36:55,001
You said nothing happened.

806
00:36:55,001 --> 00:36:56,168
Are you crazy?

807
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,793
Are you crazy? I'm asking you.

808
00:37:02,501 --> 00:37:03,335
You killed someone?

809
00:37:03,335 --> 00:37:04,210
You know what?

810
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:06,418
Do you know what killing is?

811
00:37:08,168 --> 00:37:10,001
You will be gone forever.

812
00:37:11,293 --> 00:37:11,835
Leave.

813
00:37:12,585 --> 00:37:14,168
Come with me. Turn yourself in.

814
00:37:14,168 --> 00:37:15,168
Xiao Feng, stop it.

815
00:37:15,168 --> 00:37:15,793
Xiao Feng.

816
00:37:16,085 --> 00:37:17,293
Xiao Feng, I beg you.

817
00:37:17,293 --> 00:37:18,501
I beg you.

818
00:37:18,626 --> 00:37:19,960
Xiao Feng, I beg you.

819
00:37:20,376 --> 00:37:22,043
How could you do this without you?

820
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,460
You must surrender to me. Now,

821
00:37:24,585 --> 00:37:25,668
Did you hear that?

822
00:37:27,918 --> 00:37:29,293
Xiao Feng, I beg you.

823
00:37:30,335 --> 00:37:31,001
Don't do that.

824
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:35,376
Who will take care of my parents?

825
00:37:44,251 --> 00:37:47,501
Xiao Feng, who will take care of my parents?

826
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:51,960
I'm sorry. I didn't want to.

827
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,210
For your parents.

828
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,335
For your family.

829
00:38:00,793 --> 00:38:01,960
Turn yourself in.

830
00:38:03,668 --> 00:38:05,043
There's still hope.

831
00:38:05,751 --> 00:38:06,835
I'll go with you.

832
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,918
I'm here with you.

833
00:38:17,418 --> 00:38:19,376
It's okay. It will pass.

834
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,293
Nothing

835
00:38:26,293 --> 00:38:27,751
Wouldn't that be the end?

836
00:38:27,751 --> 00:38:28,501
is or isn't

837
00:38:28,751 --> 00:38:30,085
You're the national champion.

838
00:38:30,418 --> 00:38:31,376
It's not for nothing.

839
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:32,501
You are still rich.

840
00:38:32,918 --> 00:38:34,751
You've been picking on your hands.

841
00:38:34,751 --> 00:38:36,251
You'd be finished earlier.

842
00:38:37,251 --> 00:38:39,001
Don't play tricks with me.

843
00:38:39,293 --> 00:38:41,376
Or I'll call your friend later.

844
00:38:45,751 --> 00:38:46,376
Let's go.

845
00:39:01,918 --> 00:39:02,960
And kill you.

846
00:39:04,501 --> 00:39:05,626
Let go of me.

847
00:41:38,251 --> 00:41:38,751
Lieutenant

848
00:41:39,126 --> 00:41:40,001
Captain, open the door.

849
00:41:41,126 --> 00:41:42,835
I hear you inside. Open the door.

850
00:42:01,335 --> 00:42:02,126
Is anyone here

851
00:42:03,335 --> 00:42:04,126
Hello

852
00:42:05,376 --> 00:42:06,251
Hello

853
00:42:07,876 --> 00:42:08,668
What are you doing?

854
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:11,251
Auntie, I'm Xiao Feng's friend.

855
00:42:11,251 --> 00:42:12,126
To find Xiao Feng.

856
00:42:12,376 --> 00:42:13,335
You're not from here.

857
00:42:13,335 --> 00:42:14,293
I haven't seen you before.

858
00:42:14,835 --> 00:42:15,335
yes

859
00:42:15,543 --> 00:42:16,710
I came from Ningjiang.

860
00:42:17,918 --> 00:42:18,335
What are you talking about?

861
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:21,168
You said you were Xiao Feng's friend.

862
00:42:21,793 --> 00:42:24,168
Yes, we met in the game.

863
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,251
I know.

864
00:42:26,251 --> 00:42:27,710
It's that...

865
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,335
The firing line, right?

866
00:42:28,335 --> 00:42:29,668
Right, right. Crossing the fire line.

867
00:42:30,293 --> 00:42:31,335
Is there anyone at home?

868
00:42:31,585 --> 00:42:32,335
old husband and wife

869
00:42:32,335 --> 00:42:33,876
