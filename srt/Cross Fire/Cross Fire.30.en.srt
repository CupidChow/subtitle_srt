00:02:55,995 --> 00:02:58,235
Crossfire Pro League CFPL

2
00:02:58,554 --> 00:02:59,875
On behalf of the domestic crossing fire

3
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,075
The highest level of competition.

4
00:03:01,075 --> 00:03:03,595
Is the most eye-catching professional event in the country.

5
00:03:04,154 --> 00:03:05,394
Crossfire Professional League

6
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,314
Made up of 16 professional teams.

7
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,275
Through the knockout rounds.

8
00:03:09,634 --> 00:03:10,914
The winner will be

9
00:03:10,914 --> 00:03:13,234
The exclusive customized champion weapon suit.

10
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,515
And will participate in crossing the fire on behalf of China.

11
00:03:15,515 --> 00:03:17,794
World Super League CFS

12
00:03:53,235 --> 00:03:54,074
didn't expect

13
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,595
He's so capable of acting.

14
00:03:58,595 --> 00:04:00,115
He did such a heartless thing.

15
00:04:00,314 --> 00:04:00,954
Guilty conscience

16
00:04:02,995 --> 00:04:03,555
Su Jiayi.

17
00:04:05,314 --> 00:04:06,594
Look at that heartless man.

18
00:04:06,874 --> 00:04:07,514
What are you looking at?

19
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,115
Play well.

20
00:04:27,555 --> 00:04:28,195
I dropped it.

21
00:04:32,234 --> 00:04:33,034
pretty

22
00:04:37,074 --> 00:04:38,715
The middle door is coming out.

23
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:41,275
The middle door fell off.

24
00:04:41,275 --> 00:04:41,794
pretty

25
00:04:57,794 --> 00:04:58,355
B The dog is gone.

26
00:05:07,075 --> 00:05:09,275
That's great. Now the score is zero to four.

27
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,154
Then go on.

28
00:05:10,154 --> 00:05:11,354
This match is not easy to play.

29
00:05:11,835 --> 00:05:12,955
Wang Kai's tactics

30
00:05:12,955 --> 00:05:14,474
It's too familiar.

31
00:05:15,034 --> 00:05:16,675
Adjust your attitude.

32
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:38,354
pretty

33
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:44,235
Why was the path lost just now?

34
00:05:46,995 --> 00:05:47,354
accident

35
00:05:47,874 --> 00:05:48,675
Don't do it again.

36
00:05:49,194 --> 00:05:49,754
I won't.

37
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:50,874
It's hard to say.

38
00:05:51,154 --> 00:05:52,594
What if you meet your ex-girlfriend again?

39
00:06:02,555 --> 00:06:03,754
A mouth is missing.

40
00:06:03,754 --> 00:06:04,515
Nice gun.

41
00:06:05,154 --> 00:06:06,235
pretty

42
00:06:11,194 --> 00:06:11,914
B side is here.

43
00:06:14,515 --> 00:06:15,154
I dropped it.

44
00:06:30,715 --> 00:06:31,835
It's too risky for you to win.

45
00:06:31,835 --> 00:06:32,634
I told you.

46
00:06:32,634 --> 00:06:33,194
Go to A University.

47
00:06:33,835 --> 00:06:35,354
Are you deaf?

48
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:36,434
You know them well.

49
00:06:37,395 --> 00:06:38,835
They also know you.

50
00:06:38,835 --> 00:06:39,955
But we don't know you.

51
00:06:41,914 --> 00:06:42,594
What do you mean?

52
00:06:43,594 --> 00:06:45,354
You don't want to cooperate, right?

53
00:06:45,594 --> 00:06:46,675
Let's go and change people.

54
00:06:46,995 --> 00:06:47,835
We really need to replace him.

55
00:06:48,434 --> 00:06:49,515
Wang Kai, go down.

56
00:06:50,154 --> 00:06:50,634
I

57
00:06:50,914 --> 00:06:51,795
Are you serious?

58
00:06:51,795 --> 00:06:53,555
I didn't go there.

59
00:06:53,715 --> 00:06:54,594
Why should I?

60
00:06:54,754 --> 00:06:55,515
What right do you have?

61
00:06:55,955 --> 00:06:56,795
Did President Xu agree to it?

62
00:06:56,795 --> 00:06:57,995
Is President Xu's replacement.

63
00:06:57,995 --> 00:06:59,075
You can't understand human language, right?

64
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:00,034
I can't leave.

65
00:07:00,555 --> 00:07:01,675
I have to finish this match.

66
00:07:02,115 --> 00:07:03,075
I'll tell you right now.

67
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:04,594
You won't be able to play this season.

68
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:05,995
down

69
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:16,674
You overdid it.

70
00:07:17,275 --> 00:07:17,794
It's bad luck.

71
00:07:18,755 --> 00:07:20,114
Why did you replace him?

72
00:07:20,914 --> 00:07:21,674
In the final analysis

73
00:07:22,315 --> 00:07:23,835
The people of Gravity still don't trust him enough.

74
00:07:24,395 --> 00:07:25,354
Adjust your attitude.

75
00:07:25,354 --> 00:07:26,354
Let's play the next round.

76
00:07:33,755 --> 00:07:34,674
I'll seal a cigarette.

77
00:07:37,515 --> 00:07:38,034
I dropped it.

78
00:07:38,034 --> 00:07:38,715
She's here.

79
00:07:39,794 --> 00:07:40,914
I was ambushed at point B.

80
00:07:41,315 --> 00:07:42,354
I dropped one from Platform A.

81
00:07:44,075 --> 00:07:44,715
The middle door fell off.

82
00:07:50,755 --> 00:07:51,635
The competition today

83
00:07:51,635 --> 00:07:53,234
It's a series of twists and turns.

84
00:07:53,234 --> 00:07:55,554
Then go on. The final chase is staged.

85
00:07:55,554 --> 00:07:56,674
Or the Gravity Team?

86
00:07:56,674 --> 00:07:57,794
Caused a lot of trouble.

87
00:07:57,794 --> 00:07:58,114
that's right

88
00:07:58,114 --> 00:07:59,755
Although on paper,

89
00:07:59,755 --> 00:08:00,435
These two teams

90
00:08:00,435 --> 00:08:01,955
It has certain power gap.

91
00:08:01,955 --> 00:08:03,315
But the competition today

92
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:04,794
Let's see the team.

93
00:08:04,794 --> 00:08:06,195
It has a lot of potential.

94
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:06,755
Yes

95
00:08:06,755 --> 00:08:08,315
Everyone played well today.

96
00:08:08,315 --> 00:08:09,114
Especially Xiangzi.

97
00:08:09,594 --> 00:08:10,635
And withstood a lot of pressure.

98
00:08:11,234 --> 00:08:12,075
We can do better.

99
00:08:12,474 --> 00:08:13,435
To adjust their attitude.

100
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:14,635
Don't be discouraged.

101
00:08:14,955 --> 00:08:15,474
Come on

102
00:08:15,635 --> 00:08:16,715
Come on. Go for it.

103
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:18,955
it doesn't matter

104
00:08:19,435 --> 00:08:20,034
For a while

105
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:21,594
Leader Chu is treating everyone to a feast.

106
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:37,554
To meet my former teammates.

107
00:08:37,554 --> 00:08:38,875
You left without telling me.

108
00:08:44,075 --> 00:08:45,474
I'm not leaving. Wait for you to mock me?

109
00:08:46,635 --> 00:08:47,234
Such a good chance.

110
00:08:47,234 --> 00:08:48,474
Of course I can't let it go.

111
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,594
I didn't expect you took so much effort to change jobs.

112
00:08:53,635 --> 00:08:54,755
To be a substitute for others.

113
00:08:56,835 --> 00:08:58,275
That's all you have.

114
00:08:58,275 --> 00:08:59,195
You lost the game.

115
00:08:59,635 --> 00:09:00,994
How dare you taunt me here?

116
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,994
We were tied before you went down.

117
00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:05,154
If you were the turning point,

118
00:09:06,154 --> 00:09:07,234
I asked for that.

119
00:09:08,955 --> 00:09:10,354
You really can't lie.

120
00:09:13,395 --> 00:09:13,914
I can't go on.

121
00:09:13,914 --> 00:09:15,234
You are always welcome to come back.

122
00:09:22,075 --> 00:09:22,674
Remember,

123
00:09:23,635 --> 00:09:24,914
Even if I went to Vietnam to cook,

124
00:09:25,354 --> 00:09:27,034
I can't go back.

125
00:09:37,554 --> 00:09:39,075
The knife was cut hard.

126
00:09:41,994 --> 00:09:42,515
Yes?

127
00:09:43,435 --> 00:09:44,154
I feel sorry for you.

128
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:47,435
I'm glad.

129
00:09:50,835 --> 00:09:52,034
After this match,

130
00:09:53,075 --> 00:09:54,315
His life will be hard.

131
00:09:57,554 --> 00:09:58,195
He deserved it.

132
00:10:02,594 --> 00:10:03,195
What about

133
00:10:04,594 --> 00:10:05,554
Boss, we're making progress.

134
00:10:05,835 --> 00:10:06,674
In this system,

135
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:07,554
A loophole was found.

136
00:10:07,554 --> 00:10:08,955
So the entrance was established.

137
00:10:09,195 --> 00:10:10,114
We can confirm his consciousness.

138
00:10:10,114 --> 00:10:10,994
Are you still inside?

139
00:10:11,674 --> 00:10:13,515
The comparison that needs to be searched.

140
00:10:13,515 --> 00:10:15,195
It might take a long time.

141
00:10:16,034 --> 00:10:17,515
How long does it take to work overtime?

142
00:10:17,835 --> 00:10:19,994
It will take more than two months at the earliest.

143
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,075
Can we get into the game now?

144
00:10:26,674 --> 00:10:27,275
Sure

145
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:28,794
I mean, can I get in?

146
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,315
I want to use the methods they used back then.

147
00:10:34,755 --> 00:10:35,715
I want to find him in the game.

148
00:10:38,794 --> 00:10:40,554
Can this work?

149
00:10:41,395 --> 00:10:43,315
It's possible in theory.

150
00:10:43,315 --> 00:10:43,955
but

151
00:10:44,315 --> 00:10:45,955
We've been working on

152
00:10:45,955 --> 00:10:47,835
There's a concern about security.

153
00:10:48,154 --> 00:10:49,554
As long as there is a ray of hope,

154
00:10:49,554 --> 00:10:50,755
We all have to try

155
00:10:51,594 --> 00:10:52,315
Go ahead.

156
00:10:52,315 --> 00:10:53,275
What preparation is needed?

157
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:55,835
We need a long period of debugging.

158
00:10:55,835 --> 00:10:57,395
But the most troublesome thing is that

159
00:10:57,395 --> 00:10:59,234
How could you let Xiao Feng come here?

160
00:11:01,195 --> 00:11:02,234
Leave this to me.

161
00:11:02,234 --> 00:11:03,594
Can the hospital agree?

162
00:11:09,994 --> 00:11:10,994
When I got into the hospital,

163
00:11:11,395 --> 00:11:12,395
You must act fast.

164
00:11:12,594 --> 00:11:13,955
It's a private hospital.

165
00:11:13,955 --> 00:11:15,515
The security must be strict.

166
00:11:15,794 --> 00:11:16,354
Don't worry.

167
00:11:16,674 --> 00:11:17,674
I've taken care of everything.

168
00:11:18,755 --> 00:11:20,755
The security guard will change during the meal.

169
00:11:21,195 --> 00:11:22,474
But what if I get caught?

170
00:11:24,515 --> 00:11:25,715
Play it by ear.

171
00:11:25,715 --> 00:11:26,955
Back then,

172
00:11:26,955 --> 00:11:28,754
From the Internet Addiction Center and Lao Sha.

173
00:11:30,354 --> 00:11:31,155
Why hasn't Lao Sha come yet?

174
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:33,474
He's never late.

175
00:11:37,075 --> 00:11:38,514
That seems to be Lao Sha.

176
00:11:39,835 --> 00:11:41,715
Why is there a woman?

177
00:11:44,915 --> 00:11:47,075
It seems that the woman is naked.

178
00:11:48,715 --> 00:11:51,155
Didn't you say we're the only four in secret?

179
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:03,514
Old Sha can

180
00:12:05,955 --> 00:12:06,634
Old sand.

181
00:12:08,754 --> 00:12:09,274
what

182
00:12:09,274 --> 00:12:09,594
This...

183
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:17,874
Old Sha, who are you scaring at night?

184
00:12:17,874 --> 00:12:18,754
What is this?

185
00:12:19,035 --> 00:12:19,994
In the middle of the night,

186
00:12:19,994 --> 00:12:21,155
Bring this thing out.

187
00:12:21,155 --> 00:12:22,035
It's so scary.

188
00:12:22,915 --> 00:12:23,874
Steal the beams and pillars and replace them with rotten timbers

189
00:12:24,315 --> 00:12:24,715
Understand?

190
00:12:24,715 --> 00:12:25,274
it

191
00:12:26,675 --> 00:12:27,234
It's a column.

192
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:30,955
I'll get the elevator.

193
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:56,114
The middle road is clear.

194
00:12:56,114 --> 00:12:57,715
I'll clean the path.

195
00:12:57,715 --> 00:12:58,594
Lower bag.

196
00:12:58,594 --> 00:13:00,195
At point A and B,

197
00:13:03,394 --> 00:13:05,234
Come on. This way.

198
00:13:05,234 --> 00:13:07,394
You must act fast.

199
00:13:07,394 --> 00:13:08,594
Here, stop here.

200
00:13:10,114 --> 00:13:10,835
Come here.

201
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:11,354
monkey

202
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:13,514
captain

203
00:13:14,514 --> 00:13:15,354
I'm sorry.

204
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,594
Xiao Feng, let's go.

205
00:13:19,114 --> 00:13:20,394
Xiao Feng.

206
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,035
What are you doing? He's still alive.

207
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:22,795
It's scary.

208
00:13:22,795 --> 00:13:23,994
I'll call the soul.

209
00:13:23,994 --> 00:13:25,274
You've been lying here for so many years.

210
00:13:25,274 --> 00:13:26,675
Xiao Feng, come with us.

211
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:28,555
Xiao Feng, come with us.

212
00:13:28,555 --> 00:13:30,435
All right, if I could, I would have called you back.

213
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:31,474
Don't talk about it. It's useless.

214
00:13:31,474 --> 00:13:32,035
Hands on

215
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:47,435
Hurry up. The doctor is coming.

216
00:13:47,435 --> 00:13:48,634
Hurry up.

217
00:13:52,634 --> 00:13:53,915
What are you doing?

218
00:13:58,915 --> 00:14:00,274
doctor

219
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:01,795
I drank some wine and asked you not to open the champagne.

220
00:14:01,955 --> 00:14:03,195
You have to open the champagne.

221
00:14:03,195 --> 00:14:04,195
You drank too much.

222
00:14:04,195 --> 00:14:05,114
Are you all right? What are you doing?

223
00:14:05,114 --> 00:14:06,075
I'm fine.

224
00:14:06,075 --> 00:14:06,675
Let's go.

225
00:14:06,675 --> 00:14:07,114
Is it all right?

226
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:08,035
Nothing

227
00:14:08,555 --> 00:14:10,474
My friend drank too much.

228
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,394
Where is the emergency room?

229
00:14:11,394 --> 00:14:12,155
The emergency room is on the first floor.

230
00:14:12,155 --> 00:14:12,715
The first floor, right?

231
00:14:12,715 --> 00:14:13,594
This is the inpatient department.

232
00:14:14,195 --> 00:14:15,315
Take a look.

233
00:14:33,474 --> 00:14:34,195
Be careful.

234
00:14:35,754 --> 00:14:37,274
The door is narrow. Take it easy.

235
00:14:37,274 --> 00:14:37,915
Slow down.

236
00:14:46,715 --> 00:14:47,675
One, two, three.

237
00:14:47,675 --> 00:14:48,155
Wait

238
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:48,795
rise

239
00:14:49,234 --> 00:14:50,594
One, two, three.

240
00:14:55,555 --> 00:14:56,994
Your car is amazing.

241
00:14:57,274 --> 00:14:58,234
There's something even better.

242
00:14:58,234 --> 00:14:59,315
Last time, I sat on it.

243
00:15:00,435 --> 00:15:00,915
what

244
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:03,795
Music

245
00:15:09,874 --> 00:15:12,035
Captain, are you happy?

246
00:15:12,035 --> 00:15:13,195
It's so high.

247
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:16,835
It's so exciting.

248
00:15:19,114 --> 00:15:20,155
I remember that

249
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:22,994
captain

250
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:24,634
Let's have fun together.

251
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:41,835
Xiaobei

252
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,634
After entering the game,

253
00:15:43,634 --> 00:15:44,874
Bring him out as soon as possible.

254
00:15:45,315 --> 00:15:46,155
But here,

255
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:47,715
I have to remind you for the last time.

256
00:15:48,195 --> 00:15:49,394
There's a firewall in the cloud.

257
00:15:49,514 --> 00:15:51,114
Will be invaded at any time.

258
00:15:51,555 --> 00:15:52,075
therefore

259
00:15:52,394 --> 00:15:53,754
It's still dangerous.

260
00:15:55,994 --> 00:15:56,754
Understood

261
00:16:17,155 --> 00:16:17,795
Let's start.

262
00:16:35,915 --> 00:16:36,915
That amazing?

263
00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:06,075
Boss

264
00:17:06,715 --> 00:17:08,994
This is the latest holographic synchronization hood.

265
00:17:11,035 --> 00:17:12,035
What is this for?

266
00:17:12,795 --> 00:17:13,795
Xiao Bei's perspective.

267
00:17:14,035 --> 00:17:15,114
What can he see in the game?

268
00:17:15,114 --> 00:17:16,195
What can we see?

269
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:18,315
Let me have a look.

270
00:17:20,354 --> 00:17:21,035
Old sand.

271
00:17:21,634 --> 00:17:23,594
Do you think this is like our

272
00:17:23,594 --> 00:17:25,594
The Internet Addiction Center.

273
00:17:26,114 --> 00:17:26,835
Give it a try.

274
00:17:38,754 --> 00:17:39,994
Xiao Feng.

275
00:17:41,874 --> 00:17:43,155
Xiao Feng.

276
00:17:45,955 --> 00:17:47,234
Xiao Feng.

277
00:17:51,354 --> 00:17:52,754
Xiao Feng.

278
00:18:12,234 --> 00:18:12,874
Old sand.

279
00:18:13,874 --> 00:18:14,555
What do you see?

280
00:18:15,555 --> 00:18:16,634
It's dark.

281
00:18:17,634 --> 00:18:18,675
Boundless

282
00:18:20,075 --> 00:18:20,915
The power is not on.

283
00:18:22,754 --> 00:18:23,234
good

284
00:18:52,195 --> 00:18:54,075
What's going on?

285
00:18:54,075 --> 00:18:54,754
Nothing

286
00:18:54,754 --> 00:18:55,394
I'm dodging bullets.

287
00:19:13,155 --> 00:19:13,754
Xiao Feng.

288
00:19:14,315 --> 00:19:14,994
Xiao Feng.

289
00:19:25,435 --> 00:19:26,835
Brother Feng, it's me.

290
00:19:59,274 --> 00:19:59,955
captain

291
00:20:00,754 --> 00:20:02,195
I saw the captain.

292
00:20:02,195 --> 00:20:03,395
Xiao Feng.

293
00:20:03,395 --> 00:20:04,595
I'm Chang Sha.

294
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:05,554
I

295
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:07,034
Let me have a look.

296
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:08,794
I'm Chang Sha.

297
00:20:08,794 --> 00:20:09,355
to wait a moment

298
00:20:09,355 --> 00:20:10,514
The system has nothing to do

299
00:20:10,514 --> 00:20:11,395
Has been matched.

300
00:20:11,395 --> 00:20:12,355
No one else can replace it.

301
00:20:14,435 --> 00:20:15,115
captain

302
00:20:16,435 --> 00:20:17,554
Nothing has changed.

303
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:18,834
You're still so handsome.

304
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:24,314
The director is not good.

305
00:20:24,314 --> 00:20:26,034
The cloud firewall found that we broke in.

306
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:27,875
Try active and passive simulation.

307
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,074
To test their firewall.

308
00:20:30,074 --> 00:20:30,554
It has no effect.

309
00:20:30,554 --> 00:20:31,314
Now the firewall is

310
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:32,715
Close all communication ports.

311
00:20:40,314 --> 00:20:40,794
That's it.

312
00:20:40,794 --> 00:20:41,834
How is Old Sha now?

313
00:20:46,595 --> 00:20:46,994
here

314
00:20:47,675 --> 00:20:48,274
There's another one here.

315
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:50,195
Good shot, Xiao Bei.

316
00:20:51,915 --> 00:20:52,675
What's wrong?

317
00:20:53,155 --> 00:20:53,675
hit

318
00:20:54,155 --> 00:20:54,834
Sneak up on me.

319
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:00,074
Nine o'clock.

320
00:21:03,635 --> 00:21:04,314
pretty

321
00:21:11,234 --> 00:21:12,715
Xiao Bei is with the captain.

322
00:21:12,715 --> 00:21:14,074
It's almost flawless.

323
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:15,274
With might redoubled

324
00:21:26,514 --> 00:21:27,155
Xiaobei

325
00:21:28,115 --> 00:21:28,994
I finally found you.

326
00:21:35,474 --> 00:21:36,115
And then,

327
00:21:37,514 --> 00:21:39,435
Then I couldn't see anything.

328
00:21:39,955 --> 00:21:40,554
how could that be?

329
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:42,474
Boss

330
00:21:42,474 --> 00:21:43,514
Sorry, the signal is interrupted.

331
00:21:43,514 --> 00:21:44,314
Fix it.

332
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:44,915
OK

333
00:21:47,234 --> 00:21:47,994
Why are you here?

334
00:21:48,715 --> 00:21:50,115
Is your former teammate Kirin.

335
00:21:50,595 --> 00:21:51,994
His team found the equipment

336
00:21:52,355 --> 00:21:54,034
Reopened the portal by caching the data.

337
00:21:54,595 --> 00:21:55,355
I knew it.

338
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:57,195
You must still be there.

339
00:22:02,435 --> 00:22:03,034
Nothing

340
00:22:04,195 --> 00:22:05,155
This often happens here.

341
00:22:05,834 --> 00:22:07,395
I've been here for 4,103 days.

342
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:08,474
Every day,

343
00:22:09,034 --> 00:22:10,115
I kept going up.

344
00:22:10,474 --> 00:22:11,234
But it's useless.

345
00:22:12,234 --> 00:22:13,155
No matter what level I hit,

346
00:22:13,514 --> 00:22:14,435
As long as you fail,

347
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:16,195
Will return to the first floor.

348
00:22:17,514 --> 00:22:18,355
I gave up.

349
00:22:19,754 --> 00:22:20,834
I'm here to take you out.

350
00:22:22,195 --> 00:22:22,754
Eleven years ago.

351
00:22:25,474 --> 00:22:26,474
Everyone is waiting for you.

352
00:22:37,234 --> 00:22:37,675
Correct!

353
00:22:38,155 --> 00:22:38,635
There's a problem.

354
00:22:38,635 --> 00:22:39,395
I've been wondering

355
00:22:39,994 --> 00:22:41,355
When you two came in,

356
00:22:41,595 --> 00:22:42,715
Why is Xu Wei out?

357
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:43,834
And you are stuck here.

358
00:22:44,554 --> 00:22:45,274
It's Xu Wei.

359
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:47,675
What do you mean?

360
00:22:49,195 --> 00:22:50,314
Who made me unable to get out.

361
00:22:51,234 --> 00:22:51,715
It's him.

362
00:22:52,195 --> 00:22:52,834
It's him.

363
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:55,554
Also

364
00:22:56,395 --> 00:22:57,435
The man who killed your brother

365
00:22:58,915 --> 00:22:59,274
It's also him.

366
00:23:04,435 --> 00:23:05,155
Not only that,

367
00:23:06,234 --> 00:23:07,635
He also killed the man

368
00:23:07,635 --> 00:23:08,474
The mechanic, Cao Lei.

369
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:09,635
His body

370
00:23:09,635 --> 00:23:11,514
Is hidden in the pool behind the Ningjiang Steel Works.

371
00:23:13,994 --> 00:23:14,754
When we go out,

372
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:17,514
Old scores and new scores.

373
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:22,994
Come on.

374
00:23:24,355 --> 00:23:25,155
Eleven years ago.

375
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:27,994
Let's fight together.

376
00:23:30,955 --> 00:23:31,395
Come on.

377
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:34,514
She's recovered.

378
00:23:35,195 --> 00:23:36,274
Is Sha getting a signal?

379
00:23:36,274 --> 00:23:37,155
I'm coming.

380
00:23:39,955 --> 00:23:41,074
They are going to the steps now.

381
00:23:54,635 --> 00:23:55,955
The exit is coming.

382
00:23:56,474 --> 00:23:57,834
There's no signal again.

383
00:23:58,074 --> 00:23:58,915
Why is the signal out again?

384
00:23:59,155 --> 00:24:01,034
The cloud firewall filters the security vulnerability.

385
00:24:01,034 --> 00:24:02,355
We are being counter-invaded now.

386
00:24:03,034 --> 00:24:03,595
Don't drop the ball.

387
00:24:03,595 --> 00:24:04,435
Get it done.

388
00:24:08,474 --> 00:24:08,994
Boss

389
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:10,635
We have reached the limit now.

390
00:24:10,635 --> 00:24:12,435
The system can last two minutes at most.

391
00:24:12,435 --> 00:24:13,195
In any case

392
00:24:13,195 --> 00:24:15,314
Make sure Xiao Bei's consciousness returns safely.

393
00:24:15,635 --> 00:24:16,195
I'll try my best.

394
00:24:21,554 --> 00:24:22,554
Brother Feng, let's go.

395
00:24:40,955 --> 00:24:42,274
Our data is being erased.

396
00:24:44,034 --> 00:24:45,915
The delete process can't be reversed now.

397
00:24:45,915 --> 00:24:46,994
I can only delay the progress.

398
00:24:48,635 --> 00:24:49,715
There are only 30 seconds left.

399
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,595
Xiao Bei, give me your hand.

400
00:24:55,635 --> 00:24:56,314
Xiaobei

401
00:24:59,155 --> 00:25:00,474
Xiao Bei, come here.

402
00:25:00,474 --> 00:25:01,595
I can't leave now.

403
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,274
If you can leave, give me your hand.

404
00:25:03,754 --> 00:25:04,754
And the last ten seconds.

405
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:05,955
Initiate and force the downlink.

406
00:25:05,955 --> 00:25:07,715
Make sure Xiao Bei's consciousness returns safely.

407
00:25:28,355 --> 00:25:29,435
If I don't wake up,

408
00:25:30,314 --> 00:25:31,474
Don't let Xu Wei go.

409
00:25:31,794 --> 00:25:32,554
What are you talking about?

410
00:25:32,554 --> 00:25:33,514
Give me your hand.

411
00:25:39,314 --> 00:25:40,314
Xiaobei

412
00:25:41,234 --> 00:25:41,994
Xiaobei

413
00:25:42,754 --> 00:25:43,435
Xiaobei

414
00:25:44,474 --> 00:25:45,635
Xiaobei

415
00:25:51,435 --> 00:25:53,435
Xiao Feng's consciousness transfer process has been activated.

416
00:25:53,435 --> 00:25:54,834
We only have five seconds left.

417
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:57,635
Quickly disconnect Xiao Bei's consciousness.

418
00:26:07,195 --> 00:26:08,715
Xiao Bei's transmission hasn't been completed yet.

419
00:26:08,715 --> 00:26:10,155
But the system can't hold on.

420
00:26:10,994 --> 00:26:12,514
The data is about to be deleted.

421
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:25,955
Xiaobei

422
00:26:29,435 --> 00:26:30,955
Has Xiao Feng finished transmitting?

423
00:26:30,955 --> 00:26:31,994
I'm not sure.

424
00:26:31,994 --> 00:26:32,834
The last moment of transmission,

425
00:26:32,834 --> 00:26:33,994
The system was shut down.

426
00:26:34,915 --> 00:26:35,715
Hurry up.

427
00:26:52,794 --> 00:26:53,274
Slow down.

428
00:26:54,074 --> 00:26:54,554
What about

429
00:26:55,474 --> 00:26:55,834
How are you?

430
00:26:58,274 --> 00:26:58,715
Are you all right?

431
00:27:00,195 --> 00:27:00,834
I'm fine.

432
00:27:01,274 --> 00:27:01,955
How is he?

433
00:27:06,715 --> 00:27:08,314
His consciousness was transmitted back.

434
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:09,994
What's going on?

435
00:27:10,234 --> 00:27:11,595
His consciousness was transmitted.

436
00:27:11,595 --> 00:27:13,355
But the system was hacked.

437
00:27:13,355 --> 00:27:15,155
In order to ensure the safe return of your consciousness,

438
00:27:15,155 --> 00:27:17,034
We have to initiate mandatory offline.

439
00:27:17,034 --> 00:27:18,435
So his teleportation

440
00:27:18,435 --> 00:27:19,435
It might be interrupted.

441
00:27:19,435 --> 00:27:21,955
And all the backups were removed completely.

442
00:27:24,234 --> 00:27:25,034
Brothers, thank you for your hard work.

443
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,155
Go out first.

444
00:27:27,274 --> 00:27:27,834
Xiao Feng.

445
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:29,675
Xiao Feng.

446
00:27:30,554 --> 00:27:31,635
Xiao Feng.

447
00:27:32,635 --> 00:27:33,115
Xiao Feng.

448
00:27:35,234 --> 00:27:36,234
Xiao Feng.

449
00:27:54,395 --> 00:27:55,074
Xiaobei

450
00:27:56,514 --> 00:27:57,195
You tried your best.

451
00:27:58,955 --> 00:27:59,875
We all saw it.

452
00:28:02,635 --> 00:28:03,115
Old sand.

453
00:28:04,395 --> 00:28:05,074
Let's get ready.

454
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:06,314
Take Xiao Feng back.

455
00:28:06,715 --> 00:28:07,395
to wait a moment

456
00:28:10,195 --> 00:28:11,635
We can't let him go back to that hospital.

457
00:28:12,355 --> 00:28:12,875
why

458
00:28:15,715 --> 00:28:17,715
Don't you suspect that

459
00:28:17,715 --> 00:28:18,635
Equipment test

460
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,195
Someone framed him?

461
00:28:21,514 --> 00:28:22,074
It's him.

462
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:26,474
Are you sure?

463
00:28:28,395 --> 00:28:29,955
Get him to a safe place.

464
00:28:30,395 --> 00:28:31,595
Don't let anyone know.

465
00:28:32,514 --> 00:28:33,435
Don't scare them.

466
00:28:34,435 --> 00:28:35,195
I know.

467
00:28:51,834 --> 00:28:52,994
Hello, son.

468
00:28:54,715 --> 00:28:55,955
What's wrong? You need me?

469
00:28:56,554 --> 00:28:57,754
Can you talk now?

470
00:28:58,074 --> 00:28:59,514
It's convenient for you to tell me.

471
00:29:00,034 --> 00:29:00,994
Eleven years ago,

472
00:29:00,994 --> 00:29:02,514
Who killed my brother?

473
00:29:05,155 --> 00:29:06,115
His name is Xu Wei.

474
00:29:06,675 --> 00:29:08,115
Is a native of Ningjiang.

475
00:29:09,074 --> 00:29:09,595
Now,

476
00:29:09,595 --> 00:29:11,274
The owner of Gravity Esports Club.

477
00:29:11,794 --> 00:29:13,155
He not only killed my brother,

478
00:29:13,554 --> 00:29:15,234
And killed the mechanic who handled the vehicle.

479
00:29:15,794 --> 00:29:16,715
How do you know?

480
00:29:17,115 --> 00:29:18,435
An insider told me.

481
00:29:19,314 --> 00:29:21,395
Son, can you make that insider

482
00:29:21,395 --> 00:29:22,155
To meet me?

483
00:29:22,514 --> 00:29:23,754
He can't see you now.

484
00:29:25,395 --> 00:29:25,994
son

485
00:29:26,915 --> 00:29:28,435
Are you joking with your dad?

486
00:29:30,234 --> 00:29:30,794
dad

487
00:29:31,595 --> 00:29:32,474
Do you believe me?

488
00:29:33,395 --> 00:29:34,715
Who was killed.

489
00:29:36,355 --> 00:29:37,754
The body was found in Ningjiang Iron and Steel Factory.

490
00:29:37,754 --> 00:29:38,435
In the pool at the back,

491
00:29:40,074 --> 00:29:40,875
Go and investigate now.

492
00:29:41,435 --> 00:29:42,395
There will be clues.

493
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:44,355
That's enough.

494
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:45,955
I will investigate him as soon as possible.

495
00:29:49,794 --> 00:29:51,234
Then B goes straight ahead.

496
00:29:51,234 --> 00:29:52,595
In this way, I've completed another package.

497
00:29:53,034 --> 00:29:55,474
And I saw a detail that

498
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,355
Every time the former leader of the defender

499
00:29:57,355 --> 00:29:59,274
There will be someone to help him.

500
00:29:59,274 --> 00:30:00,915
This is a very detailed place.

501
00:30:01,514 --> 00:30:02,875
Okay, we have arrived here.

502
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:04,355
The last point of the first half.

503
00:30:04,355 --> 00:30:06,274
At the beginning, I killed 2V.

504
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:07,514
Where's your crutch?

505
00:30:09,554 --> 00:30:10,274
Don't need it.

506
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:11,834
Do you know

507
00:30:11,834 --> 00:30:13,274
What is the target of gravity this year?

508
00:30:14,435 --> 00:30:16,074
He must be the defending champion.

509
00:30:16,635 --> 00:30:17,754
According to their capabilities,

510
00:30:18,355 --> 00:30:19,355
There should be no suspense.

511
00:30:20,274 --> 00:30:21,955
As long as they win the championship again,

512
00:30:22,234 --> 00:30:23,355
Gravity will be on the market.

513
00:30:23,915 --> 00:30:24,994
Xu Wei's goal

514
00:30:24,994 --> 00:30:27,115
Is the first e-sports club in the country.

515
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:30,234
None of these goals will be achieved.

516
00:30:37,234 --> 00:30:38,155
Why are you saying that?

517
00:30:38,675 --> 00:30:39,994
Because we will stop them.

518
00:30:40,915 --> 00:30:42,274
But our goal this year

519
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:43,034
Isn't it relegation?

520
00:30:44,314 --> 00:30:45,074
That was the past.

521
00:30:46,115 --> 00:30:47,234
From now on,

522
00:30:47,234 --> 00:30:49,074
The team has only one goal this year.

523
00:30:50,675 --> 00:30:51,635
The champion

524
00:30:52,115 --> 00:30:53,635
From gravity.

525
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:55,595
My dear Captain Lu,

526
00:30:55,915 --> 00:30:57,034
Can we be practical?

527
00:30:57,435 --> 00:30:58,155
I'm just bragging.

528
00:30:58,155 --> 00:30:59,155
I dare not do that.

529
00:30:59,155 --> 00:31:01,474
Because Wang Kai was taken away by gravity,

530
00:31:01,474 --> 00:31:02,994
Or because of your personal feud with Xu Wei?

531
00:31:06,595 --> 00:31:07,435
To take revenge.

532
00:31:10,195 --> 00:31:12,074
And in their worst way.

533
00:31:12,355 --> 00:31:13,474
The Organizing Committee

534
00:31:13,474 --> 00:31:15,274
Evaluated the 16 teams in the league.

535
00:31:15,715 --> 00:31:16,635
Our team

536
00:31:16,635 --> 00:31:18,195
The odds are in the bottom three.

537
00:31:18,715 --> 00:31:20,314
So your goal

538
00:31:20,314 --> 00:31:21,355
May not be practical.

539
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,355
We lost 2-1 to Gravity.

540
00:31:26,355 --> 00:31:28,074
Do you really think the gap is that big?

541
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:38,915
Raise your head and look at me.

542
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:43,715
That's right.

543
00:31:45,715 --> 00:31:47,554
We are an untrusted team.

544
00:31:47,994 --> 00:31:49,074
But so what?

545
00:31:49,994 --> 00:31:51,715
No one believes that we can defeat a hundred cities.

546
00:31:51,715 --> 00:31:52,514
No one believes that we can

547
00:31:52,514 --> 00:31:53,435
The semi-professional champion.

548
00:31:53,435 --> 00:31:54,195
No one believes that we will.

549
00:31:54,195 --> 00:31:55,355
To the Crossfire League.

550
00:31:56,034 --> 00:31:56,754
But these

551
00:31:57,955 --> 00:31:58,834
We all did it.

552
00:31:59,314 --> 00:32:01,155
Even if the whole world doesn't believe us,

553
00:32:02,435 --> 00:32:03,314
So what?

554
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,514
As long as we believe in ourselves,

555
00:32:07,794 --> 00:32:08,595
champion

556
00:32:12,074 --> 00:32:12,834
It's possible.

557
00:32:26,514 --> 00:32:27,314
Go on.

558
00:32:27,754 --> 00:32:28,994
And wins.

559
00:32:37,314 --> 00:32:38,754
The first four rounds

560
00:32:38,754 --> 00:32:39,834
The advantage is obvious.

561
00:32:40,355 --> 00:32:41,994
The top defense strategy is very good.

562
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:43,074
Especially King.

563
00:32:43,074 --> 00:32:44,834
Keep putting pressure on the attacker.

564
00:32:45,155 --> 00:32:47,675
Force the team to go on A road and A small.

565
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:48,514
Making mistakes all the time.

566
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:51,554
This round is a turning point of the match.

567
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:52,635
The point we lost

568
00:32:52,994 --> 00:32:54,195
From the data,

569
00:32:54,635 --> 00:32:56,955
S + 1 is a weakness of the Continuity Team.

570
00:32:56,955 --> 00:32:57,474
WangKai

571
00:32:57,955 --> 00:32:59,554
What were you thinking?

572
00:33:01,994 --> 00:33:02,915
Answer my question.

573
00:33:03,474 --> 00:33:04,115
Nothing.

574
00:33:05,514 --> 00:33:06,115
I made a mistake.

575
00:33:06,754 --> 00:33:07,595
An error

576
00:33:08,474 --> 00:33:10,074
Stand up and have a look.

577
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:11,955
Although the five of you are on the stage,

578
00:33:11,955 --> 00:33:13,635
But there are dozens of people standing behind.

579
00:33:13,915 --> 00:33:15,115
Tell me about the mistake.

580
00:33:17,234 --> 00:33:18,715
Gravity's goal this year

581
00:33:18,715 --> 00:33:20,274
To win the championship.

582
00:33:20,754 --> 00:33:21,675
I can't accept it.

583
00:33:21,675 --> 00:33:22,675
Such a simple mistake.

584
00:33:31,274 --> 00:33:32,514
We won the game.

585
00:33:33,074 --> 00:33:33,994
But I'm not satisfied.

586
00:33:34,395 --> 00:33:36,635
Because I see a threat in these numbers.

587
00:33:36,635 --> 00:33:38,195
A small team like the Continuing Team.

588
00:33:38,195 --> 00:33:39,635
Can bite off a piece of meat from us.

589
00:33:40,074 --> 00:33:41,554
What will the other teams think?

590
00:33:42,314 --> 00:33:43,474
The ant always has an illusion.

591
00:33:43,834 --> 00:33:45,875
They always thought they could eat the elephant one day.

592
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:46,754
Your task is to

593
00:33:46,754 --> 00:33:47,715
And tell the ants

594
00:33:47,994 --> 00:33:49,074
Stop daydreaming.

595
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:51,395
The world only talks about power.

596
00:33:51,754 --> 00:33:52,675
There is no miracle.

597
00:33:53,274 --> 00:33:54,195
Are you clear?

598
00:33:54,474 --> 00:33:55,635
understand

599
00:34:08,234 --> 00:34:09,314
traitor

600
00:34:10,754 --> 00:34:11,355
Leave now.

601
00:34:31,754 --> 00:34:32,675
In the first half,

602
00:34:32,675 --> 00:34:34,034
A score of nine to zero,

603
00:34:34,715 --> 00:34:36,355
This map has already confirmed

604
00:34:36,355 --> 00:34:38,355
What kind of situation happened?

605
00:34:38,355 --> 00:34:40,675
This side is definitely the place

606
00:34:57,875 --> 00:34:58,355
get up

607
00:34:58,554 --> 00:34:59,195
Why?

608
00:34:59,794 --> 00:35:00,635
You came to the wrong place.

609
00:35:01,034 --> 00:35:02,635
Why can't I come if you can?

610
00:35:02,635 --> 00:35:04,715
I don't think your name is on it.

611
00:35:04,715 --> 00:35:06,234
Only King and I can use this place.

612
00:35:06,514 --> 00:35:07,034
WangKai

613
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,794
You take yourself too seriously.

614
00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:09,875
King can do that.

615
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:10,474
you

616
00:35:10,794 --> 00:35:12,115
What are you doing?

617
00:35:12,115 --> 00:35:13,595
You don't know anything.

618
00:35:14,754 --> 00:35:16,474
You want to sit in the seat?

619
00:35:20,195 --> 00:35:21,034
Wang Kai, why are you letting go?

620
00:35:21,034 --> 00:35:21,754
Say it again.

621
00:35:21,754 --> 00:35:22,875
Wang Kai, what are you doing?

622
00:35:23,115 --> 00:35:24,034
I want to train.

623
00:35:24,034 --> 00:35:26,034
The seat is shared by the whole team.

624
00:35:26,034 --> 00:35:27,514
You can use it if you want.

625
00:35:27,514 --> 00:35:28,834
Come to me in advance.

626
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:29,435
This is Liang Team.

627
00:35:29,435 --> 00:35:30,994
I emphasized at the regular meeting.

628
00:35:30,994 --> 00:35:31,635
Did you hear that?

629
00:35:43,715 --> 00:35:44,474
Why?

630
00:35:47,234 --> 00:35:49,155
She won't let you use the seat today.

631
00:35:49,155 --> 00:35:49,994
We can do it tomorrow.

632
00:35:49,994 --> 00:35:51,195
And kick you out of the lineup.

633
00:35:51,195 --> 00:35:51,955
干你屁事

634
00:35:52,355 --> 00:35:52,754
Look.

635
00:35:53,115 --> 00:35:54,834
I care about you.

636
00:35:54,834 --> 00:35:55,754
If you're strong enough,

637
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:56,915
To be a substitute.

638
00:35:56,915 --> 00:35:58,074
That would be a pity.

639
00:35:58,074 --> 00:35:58,834
Let me give you a trick.

640
00:36:01,554 --> 00:36:01,915
say

641
00:36:03,314 --> 00:36:05,195
Your relationship with Leader Liang is not good recently.

642
00:36:05,435 --> 00:36:06,435
You need to repair it.

643
00:36:07,074 --> 00:36:07,794
It's been a long time.

644
00:36:08,115 --> 00:36:08,915
Did you give her a gift?

645
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:10,554
Why should I give her gifts?

646
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:12,115
This is the way of the world.

647
00:36:12,115 --> 00:36:13,554
It's a rule, Big Brother.

648
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,274
If you give her a gift,

649
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:17,595
It's good for you, but not bad.

650
00:36:20,234 --> 00:36:20,875
What are you giving me?

651
00:36:21,514 --> 00:36:22,635
Leave it alone.

652
00:36:22,915 --> 00:36:24,355
What fancy watch?

653
00:36:24,355 --> 00:36:26,314
A designer backpack is almost enough.

654
00:36:27,635 --> 00:36:28,274
You can buy anything.

655
00:36:28,474 --> 00:36:29,474
Don't buy high imitation.

656
00:36:50,155 --> 00:36:51,395
I was going to look for you.

657
00:36:52,274 --> 00:36:53,834
Why didn't you go on the live stream last night?

658
00:36:53,834 --> 00:36:54,955
How many times have I told you?

659
00:36:54,955 --> 00:36:55,595
This is the mission.

660
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:57,395
I don't want to.

661
00:36:58,074 --> 00:36:58,834
I want to train.

662
00:36:58,834 --> 00:37:00,435
Isn't training ten hours a day enough?

663
00:37:01,314 --> 00:37:02,274
I think it's not enough.

664
00:37:06,794 --> 00:37:08,195
Is the club run by your family?

665
00:37:08,555 --> 00:37:09,595
Do whatever you want.

666
00:37:09,874 --> 00:37:10,515
I want gravity.

667
00:37:10,515 --> 00:37:12,234
To be an e-sports player.

668
00:37:12,234 --> 00:37:13,274
It's live.

669
00:37:13,635 --> 00:37:14,434
Also

670
00:37:14,595 --> 00:37:16,234
Don't let me do anything that I'm not willing to do.

671
00:37:25,675 --> 00:37:26,794
I'm telling you,

672
00:37:26,794 --> 00:37:28,635
Can stand the three shots of AK.

673
00:37:28,635 --> 00:37:29,754
There are only boxes.

674
00:37:29,995 --> 00:37:32,075
Old Ironmen, double click 66, go.

675
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:33,834
Brush the fan glow stick in the backpack.

676
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,234
Thank you for my little gift from Brother Hui of Shenyang.

677
00:37:36,234 --> 00:37:38,314
Have a good day today.

678
00:37:38,515 --> 00:37:39,314
I'm telling you,

679
00:37:39,314 --> 00:37:40,234
AK doesn't nod.

680
00:37:40,234 --> 00:37:41,075
It's called a poker.

681
00:37:41,874 --> 00:37:42,595
The middle road.

682
00:37:42,595 --> 00:37:43,874
What about the guy who wanted to shoot me?

683
00:37:43,874 --> 00:37:44,475
Come on.

684
00:37:44,475 --> 00:37:45,394
I'm telling you,

685
00:37:45,394 --> 00:37:46,515
In the wind and rain,

686
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:47,914
I will stick to you in the middle.

687
00:37:47,914 --> 00:37:49,195
If you have the ability, come here.

688
00:37:49,195 --> 00:37:51,155
I can't wait for you.

689
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:56,394
Thank me.

690
00:37:56,394 --> 00:37:59,155
The rocket of Master Mo Xiao who lies drunk on the battlefield

691
00:37:59,555 --> 00:38:00,115
Come on.

692
00:38:00,115 --> 00:38:02,434
Our textbook Qingzhong Road

693
00:38:02,434 --> 00:38:03,715
To perform for you.

694
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:05,035
I don't have any rockets.

695
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:06,515
Why did you brush so many rockets?

696
00:38:06,515 --> 00:38:07,515
There are so many people here.

697
00:38:07,874 --> 00:38:08,595
Namely

698
00:38:08,595 --> 00:38:11,274
Why are all the rich people chasing your room?

699
00:38:11,274 --> 00:38:12,914
That's a double kill.

700
00:38:12,914 --> 00:38:14,475
Four shots in the middle.

701
00:38:14,475 --> 00:38:15,234
The last one.

702
00:38:15,635 --> 00:38:16,995
A head shot.

703
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:18,715
Five kills.

704
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:20,035
It's that simple.

705
00:38:22,754 --> 00:38:25,314
Thank you for my fairy sister's rocket.

706
00:38:25,314 --> 00:38:26,635
Love you.

707
00:38:26,635 --> 00:38:27,954
Mother!

708
00:38:28,874 --> 00:38:30,555
Isn't this my brother Bao?

709
00:38:30,914 --> 00:38:34,075
Thank you for the super rocket sent by my brother Bao.

710
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,195
Come on. Brush the background music.

711
00:38:39,675 --> 00:38:40,954
Why are they all rich?

712
00:38:40,954 --> 00:38:43,394
Thank you for my brother Bao's support.

713
00:39:19,635 --> 00:39:20,274
What's wrong?

714
00:39:20,635 --> 00:39:21,715
You quarreled with Qing Xue?

715
00:39:21,995 --> 00:39:23,195
She blocked me.

716
00:39:27,434 --> 00:39:29,475
This woman has conscience.

717
00:39:30,115 --> 00:39:31,555
You only cheat, but don't cheat.

718
00:39:31,555 --> 00:39:32,274
Brother Hao, help me.

719
00:39:32,274 --> 00:39:33,234
Help me get her back.

720
00:39:33,234 --> 00:39:34,195
I beg you.

721
00:39:34,195 --> 00:39:35,475
You're the most powerful, Brother Hao.

722
00:39:35,475 --> 00:39:36,475
Help me get her back, Brother Hao.

723
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:37,155
younger brother

724
00:39:37,155 --> 00:39:38,155
That can be lost.

725
00:39:38,155 --> 00:39:38,954
Don't feel pity.

726
00:39:38,954 --> 00:39:39,874
Because from the beginning,

727
00:39:39,874 --> 00:39:40,715
It doesn't belong to you.

728
00:39:45,234 --> 00:39:46,115
I've been there.

729
00:39:46,115 --> 00:39:46,874
Lovelorn

730
00:39:46,874 --> 00:39:48,675
Is the only way for a man to grow up.

731
00:39:48,675 --> 00:39:49,234
That's right.

732
00:39:49,234 --> 00:39:51,195
Without lovelorn love,

733
00:39:51,195 --> 00:39:52,314
Without being lovelorn,

734
00:39:52,314 --> 00:39:53,834
Do not know life

735
00:39:56,234 --> 00:39:58,234
You often fall out of love.

736
00:39:58,234 --> 00:39:59,075
It's me.

737
00:40:00,515 --> 00:40:02,075
I've always wanted people to break up.

738
00:40:06,874 --> 00:40:07,675
The so-called

739
00:40:07,675 --> 00:40:10,234
A leaf in the flowers doesn't touch me.

740
00:40:11,195 --> 00:40:11,794
It's true.

741
00:40:11,794 --> 00:40:13,274
This is the first time I've ever heard of a man

742
00:40:13,475 --> 00:40:15,234
It sounds so fresh and refined.

743
00:40:16,555 --> 00:40:17,115
Brother,

744
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:19,995
Everything is a dream.

745
00:40:28,274 --> 00:40:28,914
WangKai

746
00:40:29,715 --> 00:40:30,234
to wait a moment

747
00:40:30,834 --> 00:40:31,354
What's up

748
00:40:32,914 --> 00:40:33,715
Sit on the bench.

749
00:40:33,834 --> 00:40:34,434
why?

750
00:40:35,274 --> 00:40:36,075
Why not?

751
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:37,874
Based on last performance,

752
00:40:38,434 --> 00:40:40,475
You'll be the substitute at the beginning of the next game.

753
00:40:40,995 --> 00:40:42,434
This is not in my contract.

754
00:40:42,434 --> 00:40:43,995
You can check my recent training record.

755
00:40:44,434 --> 00:40:45,555
Are at the front.

756
00:40:45,555 --> 00:40:46,834
You can use me as a substitute.

757
00:40:47,555 --> 00:40:48,834
Ask Mr. Xu to tell me personally.

758
00:41:04,874 --> 00:41:06,354
You're really something.

759
00:41:06,754 --> 00:41:07,675
I asked you to give a gift.

760
00:41:07,675 --> 00:41:08,954
You should use it first.

761
00:41:09,195 --> 00:41:10,314
I won't fawn on her.

762
00:41:11,075 --> 00:41:12,234
See what she can do to me.

763
00:41:13,035 --> 00:41:14,475
But you're really tough this afternoon.

764
00:41:14,754 --> 00:41:15,874
You dared to fight with the leader.

765
00:41:16,475 --> 00:41:18,075
Didn't she want to take advantage of it?

766
00:41:18,635 --> 00:41:20,195
I told her I wasn't...

767
00:41:20,195 --> 00:41:21,874
As long as Xu can support you,

768
00:41:21,874 --> 00:41:22,635
Then I'm not afraid.

769
00:41:23,115 --> 00:41:23,635
No matter how powerful she is,

770
00:41:23,635 --> 00:41:25,155
You can't go against the boss.

771
00:41:26,035 --> 00:41:26,834
wait and see

772
00:41:34,394 --> 00:41:35,675
This is my own place.

773
00:41:36,195 --> 00:41:37,475
Few people in the company know about it.

774
00:41:37,794 --> 00:41:38,354
Don't worry.

775
00:41:38,794 --> 00:41:39,234
It's safe.

776
00:41:40,234 --> 00:41:41,475
Sorry, Brother Kirin.

777
00:41:41,475 --> 00:41:42,914
I didn't make him wake up.

778
00:41:42,914 --> 00:41:43,874
There's nothing to be sorry about.

779
00:41:44,475 --> 00:41:45,635
If he can wake up,

780
00:41:46,515 --> 00:41:47,794
She's already awake.

781
00:41:50,115 --> 00:41:50,555
Let's go.

782
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:53,314
The nurse will come to nurse him later.
