1
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:41,359
Your noodles are here.

2
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:42,599
Thank you, boss.

3
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,119
Thank you

4
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:43,560
Take it easy.

5
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:45,640
We haven't eaten at her place for a long time.

6
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,679
Do you remember?

7
00:02:46,679 --> 00:02:47,799
When we were here,

8
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:48,959
No one will eat it.

9
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,040
This shop is popular with us.

10
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,479
You won't know what it means until you finish it.

11
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,439
It's amazing.

12
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,240
Is as charming as you.

13
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,279
As usual.

14
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,720
I'll give you a meatball.

15
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,680
Eat more meat.

16
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,599
Do you remember?

17
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,760
How did we meet?

18
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,720
On April 24, 2006,

19
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,199
Jinhai Internet Cafe in Yuzhong Road

20
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,720
Back then, in order to defeat the anti-terrorism elite,

21
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,239
I almost fought with someone.

22
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:12,199
Or the fight I pulled for you?

23
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,280
We fought all night.

24
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,479
I have no money.

25
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,400
Then the fat webmaster chased him all over the street.

26
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,879
You were barefoot and your shoes were gone.

27
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,199
How dare you criticize me?

28
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,400
I did that to save you.

29
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:24,720
Your shirt was torn by the fat webmaster.

30
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,439
Bellyband

31
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,360
Don't tell me I'm good with you.

32
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:29,159
After we came out,

33
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,960
I went to several internet cafes to rent a night.

34
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,400
Then you said,

35
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,280
We need to form a team.

36
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,600
The two of us

37
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,000
Have more.

38
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:36,839
good

39
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,199
And then we both came up with a name.

40
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,839
No one can be convinced.

41
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,639
We went to play the arcade once.

42
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:46,639
This is the last coin left.

43
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:47,999
You said you wanted to keep it.

44
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:48,999
Why should I keep it?

45
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,800
As long as you have it,

46
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:53,440
To prove that our team has a chance.

47
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,240
Then you gave it a name.

48
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,919
call

49
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,359
The Coin Team.

50
00:03:58,359 --> 00:03:59,359
I corrected you.

51
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:00,359
It's called onecoin.

52
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,279
Didn't you call it Gangfen Team?

53
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,479
I was wondering

54
00:04:04,559 --> 00:04:05,479
Why are you yelling?

55
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,999
You call it one coin.

56
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,839
The international style.

57
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,040
I still think the team is more foreign.

58
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:12,999
At that time

59
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,600
Did we still swear?

60
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:17,079
He said that within a year,

61
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,320
And won the national championship.

62
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:19,639
yes

63
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,320
A year and a half later,

64
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,199
We didn't even call Ning Jiang District.

65
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,559
to speak the truth

66
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,639
You won't regret it later.

67
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:35,760
What?

68
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,119
Follow me.

69
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,079
You haven't managed to get out of it.

70
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:41,959
Although you don't say it,

71
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:42,679
I know that.

72
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,639
Your parents really hate you to go this way.

73
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,160
I don't like to regret.

74
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:47,880
Even if you choose the wrong way,

75
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,880
I want to go on.

76
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:50,040
Maybe in the future,

77
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,359
To take an unusual path.

78
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:52,880
Right?

79
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,359
What if it fails?

80
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,440
impossible

81
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,280
In my dictionary of life,

82
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,760
Without failure,

83
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,519
Didn't you say a master has done the calculation for us?

84
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,359
He said we would definitely win the national championship.

85
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,720
Do you know what the master said?

86
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,720
He said our future will be better and better.

87
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,000
Crossing the fire will become more and more hot.

88
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,840
There will be a club after crossing the fire.

89
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,880
There will be a professional league.

90
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,479
If you play well, you can play abroad.

91
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,679
Do you know how much the future champion will get?

92
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,479
How many

93
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,479
Millions.

94
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,359
Really?

95
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:27,399
And no one will ever say that

96
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,160
You're not doing your job.

97
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:29,479
You know what they call us?

98
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,040
Professional e-sports player.

99
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,079
Do you believe that?

100
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,120
As long as you believe it, I will.

101
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,359
Eat noodles.

102
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:51,160
Lieutenant

103
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:53,519
Go Dutch later.

104
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,519
Please.

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,959
Good news, everyone.

106
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,000
The sports reporter wants to interview us.

107
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,239
To interview us.

108
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:08,959
Well

109
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,639
Are we so famous?

110
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:11,880
They heard that

111
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,720
We won the championship in Ning Jiang Team.

112
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,160
The newspaper wants to publish an article.

113
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,840
Video games are also sports games.

114
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,040
Good thing

115
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,440
Make an appointment with the reporter.

116
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,120
Are you free tomorrow?

117
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,919
I'm free if I have no time.

118
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:23,639
Tell them

119
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,160
We will cooperate fully.

120
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:25,639
a row

121
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:27,280
I'll text them later to confirm.

122
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,479
Shall we get a haircut first?

123
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:31,160
You can be more handsome in the newspaper.

124
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:31,880
you

125
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:32,840
Haircut

126
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:33,840
Don't.

127
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,000
First, plastic surgery.

128
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,120
What are you laughing at?

129
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,519
What were you looking at?

130
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:42,000
tactics

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,239
Yes

132
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:43,519
I just watched tactical training.

133
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:44,239
Yes

134
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,560
We are pressed for time.

135
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:47,239
Alright

136
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:55,880
dirty

137
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,039
It's so late.

138
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,440
I want to talk to you.

139
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,039
Are you sleepy?

140
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm a night owl.

141
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,240
Three days and three nights without sleep.

142
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,519
How is your short board getting along?

143
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:18,440
He...

144
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:19,920
Now it's a nuclear weapon.

145
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,639
Thief expansion

146
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:21,880
I'm telling you,

147
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,120
You can't keep doing this.

148
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,199
Experience this thing.

149
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,880
Is precious to other professions.

150
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,159
But for us,

151
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:29,320
It won't work when experience turns into routine.

152
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,279
Others are fast.

153
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,800
It's easy to figure out a way to deal with you.

154
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,279
yes

155
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,519
This is the most charming part of esports.

156
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,159
Not only brave,

157
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,079
Even if you want to fight,

158
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,120
that's right

159
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,399
Who play games.

160
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,480
None of them are idiots.

161
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,599
Right?

162
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,159
How is your leg?

163
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,079
It's still the same.

164
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,560
I don't care anymore.

165
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,839
You don't play games.

166
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:03,680
you

167
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,519
Are you crazy?

168
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,039
You're good at running.

169
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:20,639
eldest brother

170
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,360
It's in the game.

171
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,000
What happened in the game?

172
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,560
You're excited in the game.

173
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,719
You will be excited in reality.

174
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,079
You were nervous in the game.

175
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,279
You're as nervous as you are in reality.

176
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,880
The game and the reality are interlinked.

177
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,000
The feeling is the same.

178
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,000
Look, just now,

179
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,120
Faster than a rabbit.

180
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,880
Try putting this feeling into reality.

181
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:41,880
I think your problem

182
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,680
It's not the leg.

183
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,240
In my heart.

184
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:50,800
come

185
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,599
Come on.

186
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,320
Both legs, push hard.

187
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,880
Get your feet off the ground.

188
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:13,959
With your toes.

189
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,120
punching

190
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:53,560
Yes, that's the feeling.

191
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,320
Remember it.

192
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,719
You can stand up in the game.

193
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:56,880
In the real world.

194
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:57,480
go

195
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,720
Xiao Feng, it's time to go.

196
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:23,319
This is the semi-final, right?

197
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,120
Why did you suddenly think of it?

198
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,399
I just flipped the game.

199
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:30,480
What's the matter

200
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,240
A sports reporter.

201
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,399
We agreed on two o'clock.

202
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,120
You forgot?

203
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:35,480
I forgot.

204
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,360
Remember that.

205
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,799
We'll leave in ten minutes.

206
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:38,880
I'm going to check if the car is coming.

207
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,600
Otherwise, I'm afraid of being late.

208
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,559
Get ready.

209
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,039
good

210
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,600
Xiao Feng.

211
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,519
It's time to go.

212
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:26,639
Be careful

213
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,559
I'll pack.

214
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:29,200
I'll get it at point A.

215
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:29,840
He's here.

216
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,319
There's one behind the shutters of Scriptures Pavilion.

217
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:31,880
Received

218
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,760
It fell off.

219
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,279
Nice

220
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:33,919
pretty

221
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,240
It's too easy.

222
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,960
It's time.

223
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,840
That's all for today.

224
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,760
I'm not tired yet. Two more laps.

225
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,919
The competition is tomorrow.

226
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,439
I'm not tired.

227
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,519
Open and select the map.

228
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,639
No

229
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,519
You have a cold and a fever.

230
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,240
We've been resting for several days.

231
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,559
You don't need to do this.

232
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,480
That's all for today.

233
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:56,399
That

234
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,080
Leave now.

235
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:58,639
I'm strong.

236
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,720
It's okay to stay up all night.

237
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,120
Come on. It's you.

238
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,960
I'm physically strong.

239
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,279
To enter the sports school.

240
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,480
Come on.

241
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:07,360
Then come on.

242
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,639
Su Jiayi.

243
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,480
Where's Cheng Hao?

244
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,600
I have no idea

245
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,919
He went out earlier than me.

246
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,480
He didn't know where he went.

247
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,200
Don't wait for him.

248
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,159
Where is the bag?

249
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:35,960
A is too big.

250
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,600
And the last one.

251
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,200
go

252
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,799
behind

253
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,799
Xiaobei

254
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:45,720
I'm late.

255
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,159
Why did you bring your own drink?

256
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,319
The fire is too serious recently.

257
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:52,720
Press the whole bag of salt water.

258
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
I won't miss the game.

259
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,600
Your face

260
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,039
It's burning like a monkey's ass. Is it okay?

261
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,919
Don't hang on.

262
00:15:58,919 --> 00:15:59,760
Go to the hospital.

263
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,760
The community nurse is not as good as me.

264
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,799
I'm not going.

265
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:05,799
blood

266
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,399
Xiao Bei, hurry up.

267
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,439
I'm dizzy with blood.

268
00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:12,360
My legs are soft.

269
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,080
Give it to me.

270
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:15,360
Don't move.

271
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,720
Go to the hospital immediately after the game.

272
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:26,279
Listen to you.

273
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,799
I'm guarding A University.

274
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,039
A, two.

275
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:33,600
One off.

276
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:36,039
Warehouse B

277
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,000
Warehouse B is gone.

278
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,760
The police

279
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,519
Amazing

280
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,120
pretty

281
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,760
ChengHao

282
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:50,519
pretty

283
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,760
Are you all right?

284
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:15,439
After five minutes, give it to me.

285
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,120
Hold on a second.

286
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:18,559
trouble

287
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,760
Give us three more.

288
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,720
You two are together.

289
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,120
We belong to group buying.

290
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,480
come

291
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,319
Take your temperature.

292
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,439
Zha

293
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,720
Take the temperature.

294
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,639
come

295
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,399
Thank you

296
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,399
It hurts so much.

297
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,720
You're almost there. Give it to me.

298
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:05,720
I'm telling you,

299
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,120
Don't bother.

300
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,760
I'm fine.

301
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,200
It's very hot.

302
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,000
No fever.

303
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,880
39 degrees.

304
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:12,919
It's 39 degrees. Is it okay?

305
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,760
It's burning.

306
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,200
Give me your thermometer.

307
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:16,120
The thermometer

308
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,600
Will I die, Xiao Bei?

309
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,200
Trust me.

310
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,200
You are absolutely hopeless.

311
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,919
Give me the thermometer.

312
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:30,200
Tell me for a while.

313
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,439
Is the reporter a man or a woman?

314
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:32,399
If she were a female reporter,

315
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:33,880
If she looks good, I'll let her be next to me.

316
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,159
If it's ugly, I'll let her sit opposite.

317
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,519
You are so shameless.

318
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:37,919
If she asks questions later,

319
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,439
I said I was Ning Jiang.

320
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,519
Isn't it good for the first sniper?

321
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:42,639
Just say you're a sniper.

322
00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:43,000
No

323
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,919
I said my name is Kirin.

324
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:46,159
I don't have a girlfriend.

325
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,120
The reporters are coming.

326
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,840
Be serious.

327
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:50,559
He's dating someone.

328
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,720
Miss Chen.

329
00:18:55,439 --> 00:18:56,480
To introduce to you.

330
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,240
This is Chen Rong from Sports Vientiane.

331
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,319
He is the captain of Xiao Feng Steel Coin Team.

332
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,000
And Xu Wei, Ming and Chang Sha Kirin.

333
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:06,919
Sit down first.

334
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,080
Don't waste time.

335
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:11,240
Let's start.

336
00:19:11,439 --> 00:19:13,399
Would you like something to drink first?

337
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,159
I have some problems here.

338
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,480
I hope you can answer honestly.

339
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,120
How long have you been playing games together?

340
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:23,480
It's been more than a year since we formed the team.

341
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,120
Do you have a formal job?

342
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,200
Internet café webmaster

343
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:31,399
Can you move over?

344
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,200
Unicorn

345
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:35,559
We usually play games.

346
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:36,639
Or training.

347
00:19:36,879 --> 00:19:38,119
What do you live on?

348
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,119
Would you ask your parents for money?

349
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:43,200
Usually, our family will support us.

350
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,240
We'll figure out a way.

351
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,760
As far as I am concerned

352
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,559
You spend a lot of time

353
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,760
Playing games in the internet café.

354
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,039
Not taking part in social work.

355
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,400
You don't learn from the outside world.

356
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,879
Why did you choose such a life?

357
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:55,960
Is it meaningful?

358
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:57,839
Miss Chen.

359
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:00,359
What's your misunderstanding about video games?

360
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,200
You're right.

361
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,879
Video games are drugs and rubbish.

362
00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:05,599
Go on.

363
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,119
I'm covering big competitions.

364
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,440
I don't know what the leader thinks.

365
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,400
Such a task,

366
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:12,640
I have to write something.

367
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,720
Press release on video game competition

368
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,559
I really hate this video game.

369
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,240
It's very harmful to teenagers.

370
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,240
It will damage your eyesight.

371
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,200
It's no good to waste time.

372
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:23,839
Who would report games as sports?

373
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,920
You're a reporter.

374
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,319
He must be more learned than us.

375
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,680
But we only know one thing.

376
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,279
You have to do everything properly.

377
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:33,000
You ate too much.

378
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,680
It can last forever.

379
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,160
right or wrong?

380
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,960
There are two sides to everything.

381
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,000
Like this coin.

382
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,279
You only look at one side.

383
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,359
It's called prejudice.

384
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,440
You don't want to do the task sent by the leader.

385
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,599
You can refuse it directly.

386
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:43,839
We are all adults.

387
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:44,960
Adults should learn to refuse.

388
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,440
Your life

389
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,760
You can avoid making others happy.

390
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:50,200
We don't need your guidance in our life.

391
00:20:50,879 --> 00:20:51,799
The interview is over.

392
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,400
Xiao Feng.

393
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,079
Bye

394
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,720
Miss Chen.

395
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,119
I hate such self-righteous people.

396
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:58,760
Don't.

397
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:00,640
You can really pretend.

398
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,079
If she brings prejudice,

399
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,160
What if I write a story?

400
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:04,920
Nothing

401
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,720
Whether she writes or not,

402
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,559
Who knew that our team

403
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,119
that's right

404
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:08,720
It's better to be famous than nobody knows about it.

405
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,440
At least we're in the newspaper.

406
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's all over.

407
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,079
It's scattered.

408
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,440
You go first.

409
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,480
I need to talk to the captain.

410
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,160
You go first.

411
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,760
What is it?

412
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:27,079
Let's order a cup of coffee.

413
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,000
How expensive is this?

414
00:21:30,879 --> 00:21:31,680
It's a luxury.

415
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:32,920
Waiter/Waitress

416
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:34,319
One cappuccino.

417
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:35,760
Another empty cup.

418
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,240
OK

419
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,160
Aren't you looking for me?

420
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,920
Tell me. What is it?

421
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,799
On the day of the semi-finals,

422
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,760
If you hadn't played so well,

423
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,879
We will definitely lose.

424
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:59,200
I watched the replay today.

425
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:01,000
Guess what I found.

426
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:01,879
what

427
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:05,440
Don't you want to say something?

428
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,240
What do you want to hear?

429
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,359
Truth

430
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,440
You found out?

431
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,200
Today is the tenth anniversary of Gravity Club.

432
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,319
Ten years ago.

433
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:54,200
Thank you for working together.

434
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,680
With me,

435
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,000
From a small team,

436
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:57,640
To create

437
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,640
The top e-sports club in the country today.

438
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:01,799
Gravity has achieved today.

439
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,760
It's not because we are better than others.

440
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:06,760
But because

441
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,920
We have experienced more setbacks than others.

442
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,240
If there are really miracles in the world,

443
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,799
Try hard.

444
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,839
It's just another name.

445
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,279
Many people asked me

446
00:23:22,879 --> 00:23:24,879
How many more games do you have to win?

447
00:23:25,879 --> 00:23:26,920
I want to tell them

448
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
The aim of gravity is not only to win the game,

449
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,599
But to build a real e-sports dynasty.

450
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:32,879
Many years later,

451
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:35,319
Maybe people will forget about the wonderful competitions.

452
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:37,359
But they'll never forget this.

453
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,200
Belongs to the dynasty of gravity.

454
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
good

455
00:23:43,879 --> 00:23:45,000
To gravity.

456
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,000
Cheers!

457
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,480
I want to hear it from you.

458
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,680
You've been beating around the bush.

459
00:24:17,879 --> 00:24:18,839
I want to say,

460
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,400
I played the assist in the semi-final.

461
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:22,319
That's it.

462
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:23,440
You...

463
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,559
You're cheating.

464
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,720
What do you think I want?

465
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,559
Such an important match.

466
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:33,119
I couldn't find you, and I didn't answer your calls.

467
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,119
Unicorn

468
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:36,000
And got a half-assed player to round up the numbers.

469
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,640
How do you want us to fight?

470
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,160
That's not why you cheated.

471
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:39,879
that

472
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:41,160
What are you asking us to do?

473
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:43,200
Go to the opponent to admit defeat.

474
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,599
Xiao Feng, we are not young anymore.

475
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:46,680
You're 25 this year.

476
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,480
I'm twenty-four.

477
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,640
Our opponents are all young.

478
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,559
They lost.

479
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,400
And the year after next.

480
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,799
If we lose,

481
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,279
There's no tomorrow.

482
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:56,760
You can't afford to lose.

483
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,079
that's right

484
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,799
I just can't afford to lose.

485
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:00,760
I want to win.

486
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,400
If we win, we can go on.

487
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,799
If we win, we won't break up.

488
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,000
Have you thought about it?

489
00:25:07,879 --> 00:25:08,879
If they find out,

490
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:11,319
Our results will be canceled.

491
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,920
So I didn't tell you.

492
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,640
From the beginning to the end,

493
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,799
I made them all.

494
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:16,839
Xiao Feng.

495
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,680
I want to win the national championship.

496
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,839
I want to earn a lot of money and become famous.

497
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,119
Let the reporter

498
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:24,200
And look down on us.

499
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,400
You can play the same game.

500
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,519
Have you heard of it?

501
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,680
Between desire and conscience,

502
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,760
Many people choose conscience.

503
00:25:40,879 --> 00:25:42,079
But in the end, I was pitiful.

504
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,799
I don't want to be pitiful.

505
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,760
I don't want you

506
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,599
What don't you want to do in the future?

507
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:50,720
I can do it.

508
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,720
As long as it's for the team,

509
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:55,359
You can't cheat for the sake of the team.

510
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:56,799
Paper can't hold fire.

511
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,680
If I didn't ask you today,

512
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,119
You will keep it a secret.

513
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:00,760
yes

514
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,839
Rotting in my stomach.

515
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:06,000
Just pretend this never happened.

516
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,240
Xu Wei.

517
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,319
Is a national champion.

518
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,240
Don't you have to turn yourself into this?

519
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,000
You should be a man first.

520
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:24,680
Xiao Feng.

521
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,039
Life is short.

522
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,279
You worked so hard.

523
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:33,279
Why can't you be greedy?

524
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,640
I want to hear it from you.

525
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,000
You've been beating around the bush.

526
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:13,240
No, I want to say,

527
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,400
Did I ask for assistance in the semi-final?

528
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,119
That's it?

529
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,079
You're cheating.

530
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,319
What do you think I want to do?

531
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,119
Such an important match.

532
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:24,319
I couldn't find you, and I didn't answer your calls.

533
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,519
Unicorn

534
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,480
And got a half-assed player to round up the numbers.

535
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,000
How do you want us to fight?

536
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:31,000
That's not why you cheated.

537
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,400
What are you asking us to do?

538
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,000
Where is it?

539
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:37,920
What's that

540
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,160
Don't pretend to be silly.

541
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,000
You can open the plug-in.

542
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,760
Let's admit cheating now.

543
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,160
You might get a lenient treatment.

544
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,039
I threw it away.

545
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:44,839
Throw it away.

546
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:46,799
I swear I threw it away.

547
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,760
I don't want to use that thing again.

548
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,799
Then we have to go too.

549
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:52,400
It's not you.

550
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,519
you

551
00:27:54,879 --> 00:27:55,799
Go now.

552
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,400
Do you know what the consequences are?

553
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,960
No matter what the consequences are,

554
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,000
We have to go too.

555
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,680
I've asked around.

556
00:28:02,879 --> 00:28:04,879
Will be disqualified from the finals.

557
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,119
And even banned for life.

558
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,640
Xiao Feng.

559
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:09,519
sorry

560
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:10,920
I brought everyone into trouble.

561
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:13,079
But no one else knows about this.

562
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,559
The opponent didn't notice it.

563
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,480
Let's admit it now.

564
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,760
Isn't that your own death?

565
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,359
I promise, just this once.

566
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:19,960
Will never appear again.

567
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,960
I knew the consequences would be serious.

568
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,279
But if I don't go,

569
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:24,640
What if it's worse?

570
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,279
If I want to go, I'll go myself.

571
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:28,279
It has nothing to do with you.

572
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:29,960
Why does it have nothing to do with me?

573
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,119
We're on the same team.

574
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,039
I'm the captain.

575
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:33,000
I have the responsibility.

576
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:34,400
No, don't.

577
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,440
What are you talking about?

578
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,440
Are you training or not?

579
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:38,879
no

580
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:39,680
go

581
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,400
training

582
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:41,879
Go to training.

583
00:28:41,879 --> 00:28:43,240
You are mysterious all the time.

584
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,160
That

585
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,119
I called Reporter Chen.

586
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,440
She still insists on sending the interview script.

587
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,799
And it's probably negative criticism.

588
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,480
I'm looking forward to it.

589
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,160
I'll see what new tricks she can play.

590
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,720
Let's go to training.

591
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,760
What are you training today?

592
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:01,960
Are you free?

593
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:04,160
I guess you're no match for Sanda.

594
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:07,279
Hello

595
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,279
Chu song

596
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:09,680
They are the same as me.

597
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,039
You're always in front of the computer.

598
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,559
Physical energy is about waste.

599
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,119
Don't bother.

600
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,879
I'll help train during the weekend.

601
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,359
To avoid catching a cold.

602
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:18,119
The whole team will rest.

603
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:19,680
How much is the speed?

604
00:29:19,879 --> 00:29:20,720
Twelve seconds, four seconds.

605
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,519
It's fast.

606
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,559
Sign up.

607
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:26,559
I want to learn running from you.

608
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,839
Don't train me to the death.

609
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:28,960
I just want to lose weight.

610
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,720
Then,

611
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:33,480
Just practice. Let's go.

612
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:34,200
Let's go.

613
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:36,799
Wait for me.

614
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,079
Go!

615
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,319
Brother Kai is chasing me.

616
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,839
I'm exhausted this afternoon.

617
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:43,480
I'm starving.

618
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,680
Why didn't you serve the dishes?

619
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,039
The coach is more tired than you.

620
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:46,640
Right?

621
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,279
He's here.

622
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,599
Chuge, what flavor do you like?

623
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:51,440
to wait a moment

624
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,519
This is their signature beef.

625
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:55,079
Try the beef. It's delicious.

626
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:55,960
Thank you

627
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,799
Since you came here,

628
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,920
My treatment as a captain has plummeted.

629
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,879
This is for you. Stop your mouth.

630
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:05,760
Try it.

631
00:30:09,879 --> 00:30:10,799
Nezha, eat.

632
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:12,960
feed

633
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:15,039
Yes, it's me.

634
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,240
Where is she now?

635
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:20,279
good

636
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,799
What's up

637
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,640
I have to go to the hospital.

638
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:24,920
My grandma fell down.

639
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,119
She had a cerebral infarction.

640
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,039
This is lucky.

641
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,359
It was delivered in time.

642
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,599
The pressure has dropped.

643
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:37,319
However

644
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:39,039
We need to stay in the hospital for observation for a while.

645
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,319
Don't let the old people suffer.

646
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,559
Or any stimulation.

647
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,599
After your grandma left the hospital,

648
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:47,599
You need someone to take care of you.

649
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:48,480
good

650
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,319
To the left.

651
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:50,599
Left

652
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,640
right

653
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,279
Xiaobei

654
00:30:52,879 --> 00:30:53,599
What are you doing?

655
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,720
fast

656
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,440
You insisted on pestering me.

657
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,839
to turn left

658
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:57,480
Left

659
00:30:57,799 --> 00:30:59,000
You insisted on pestering me to play games.

660
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,680
left

661
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,559
to turn left

662
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,079
grandma

663
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,200
The doctor said that

664
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,119
You need to stay in bed.

665
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:06,119
What are you doing here?

666
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:06,760
What are you doing?

667
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,160
What are you doing?

668
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,359
You want me to lie like an old man.

669
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,039
is or isn't

670
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:12,680
No

671
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,319
go

672
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,720
My old sisters said they would visit me.

673
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,879
I don't brush my hair.

674
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:19,640
Don't wash your face.

675
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,760
You don't even wear makeup.

676
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,480
I don't wear makeup.

677
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,200
Don't wear makeup.

678
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:25,920
How can I meet them? I...

679
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,000
grandma

680
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,960
Don't worry.

681
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,119
If you want to style,

682
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:33,160
We have a ready-made stylist here.

683
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:41,960
Can he do it?

684
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,359
You didn't even understand it in your own head.

685
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,279
How are you, grandma?

686
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,160
Are you satisfied?

687
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,799
dissatisfied

688
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:29,640
Let him redo it.

689
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,839
It's so beautiful.

690
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,359
It's much better than what grandma did.

691
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:37,440
Are you satisfied?

692
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,359
Satisfied?

693
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,519
If you're satisfied, let's go to bed and rest.

694
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,480
The doctors and nurses will talk about me.

695
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:49,319
Grandma, we're here to see you.

696
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:50,200
We also brought

697
00:32:58,599 --> 00:32:58,960
grandma

698
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,680
I'm telling you,

699
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,599
Four dishes and one soup.

700
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,039
I kissed them.

701
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,000
I did it myself.

702
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,359
The dishes are made by Su Jiayi.

703
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:10,079
It's Chu Ge who did this.

704
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,519
Of course, I'm not free.

705
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,720
I'll be in charge of

706
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,039
Mainly responsible for drooling.

707
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,359
grandma

708
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,519
Smell the soup. It smells good.

709
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:19,240
good

710
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,440
Grandma has cooked this soup for three or four hours.

711
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,079
It smells really good.

712
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:26,760
Hey, Kai.

713
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,119
How lucky you are.

714
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:29,680
It's not related.

715
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,440
When you're upset,

716
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,799
They are all here to help you, right?

717
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,359
Grandma, you don't know

718
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:36,559
When we quarreled,

719
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:37,680
One is better than the other.

720
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,760
There's no friend who doesn't fight.

721
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,799
If you don't fight, you're not a real friend.

722
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,760
friend

723
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,079
When I was on the dark road,

724
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,440
You can catch that person.

725
00:33:48,879 --> 00:33:50,240
That's true friend.

726
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:01,960
Grandma, eat up.

727
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,359
That's right.

728
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:02,480
come

729
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,200
Don't get cold.

730
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:03,519
come

731
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:03,760
Start

732
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,079
well

733
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,200
A glass of lemonade.

734
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,000
One more cup.

735
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,799
Americano

736
00:34:18,799 --> 00:34:19,480
What's up

737
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,640
What are you looking at?

738
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:23,920
hurry up

739
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,079
Let's go. The game is about to begin.

740
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:30,319
I'm coming. Hurry up.

741
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,960
Don't be nervous.

742
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,879
The victory rate of this team is less than 20%.

743
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:35,599
We can win with our eyes closed.

744
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:36,960
We've always been stubborn.

745
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,680
This time, I finally picked a soft persimmon.

746
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:05,359
Long time no see

747
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:07,960
I didn't expect there was a team willing to take you in.

748
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,879
I miss you so much.

749
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:11,879
They haven't disbanded yet.

750
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:12,720
After you left,

751
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,279
We don't know how happy we are.

752
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,000
There's no one to brush the gifts in the studio.

753
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,960
It's a little miserable.

754
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:17,200
you

755
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:18,240
other

756
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,240
What happened

757
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,039
know

758
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:22,799
More than knowing each other.

759
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,920
Introduce yourself.

760
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,680
We're from Ji Guang Yu Team.

761
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,720
I'm Captain Qiao.

762
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,519
Su Jiayi and I used to

763
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:29,680
The Blue Fish Team.

764
00:35:30,279 --> 00:35:31,480
The captain of the team, Lu Xiaobai,

765
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,039
ChengHao

766
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:32,680
Nezha, protection deity

767
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,519
If she hadn't abandoned her halfway,

768
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:36,960
The Blue Fish Team won't disband.

769
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:37,920
How many of you

770
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,640
If you have less love and more training,

771
00:35:40,879 --> 00:35:41,680
The Blue Fish Team

772
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,720
They wouldn't be called the Vase Team.

773
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,440
What you said,

774
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,039
Little sister.

775
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,519
Calm down.

776
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,920
Friendship comes first.

777
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,760
Keep smiling.

778
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,480
The game will start in ten minutes.

779
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,879
Shall we continue to talk?

780
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,400
Alright.

781
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,400
See you on the battlefield.

782
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,119
Little sister.

783
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,440
Add a WeChat.

784
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,440
My WeChat account is CH1008.

785
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,559
Waiting for you.

786
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:12,720
ChengHao

787
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,519
Can you be successful?

788
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,599
What's your last name?

789
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:17,599
You forgot it.

790
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,160
I'm not spying on the enemy.

791
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,480
I have dedicated myself.

792
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:22,400
I think you're in a rut.

793
00:37:59,879 --> 00:38:01,279
The opponent is not weak, but good.

794
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,879
Wang Kai, get off at A. Bao Jiayi, come with me.

795
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:03,640
Received

796
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:06,520
Keep an eye on A.

797
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,760
WangKai

798
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,720
There's someone in the back.

799
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,399
I'll do it.

800
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:14,560
The middle door.

801
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,399
pretty

802
00:38:24,919 --> 00:38:25,680
eldest brother

803
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,520
Are you out of your mind?

804
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,600
Or the headset is broken?

805
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,160
Can't you hear the footsteps?

806
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:42,919
Nothing

807
00:38:42,919 --> 00:38:44,120
Keep your mind steady and take the lead.

808
00:39:31,439 --> 00:39:32,279
I'll search their houses.

809
00:39:32,279 --> 00:39:33,520
Be careful A, be careful with A

810
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,399
Received

811
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,520
Guo, go around the rear.

812
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,279
good

813
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,120
Good shot, Nezha.

814
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,919
Let me go around.

815
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,520
One off.

816
00:40:01,879 --> 00:40:02,760
There's another one.

817
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:05,999
pretty

818
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:09,839
I saw it.

819
00:40:25,279 --> 00:40:26,040
pretty

820
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,560
Good, Su Jiayi.

821
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:30,720
come

822
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,879
It's dangerous.

823
00:40:31,959 --> 00:40:33,560
I almost flipped the boat in the gutter.

824
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:34,319
pretty

825
00:40:58,359 --> 00:40:59,080
You played well.

826
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,399
congratulations

827
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,359
Thank you

828
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:05,720
There's progress.

829
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,160
Those shots that blocked us just now,

830
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:09,160
You've hit him hard enough.

831
00:41:09,279 --> 00:41:11,720
My teammates are meat eaters.

832
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,399
I'm the most gentle.

833
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:17,640
Come on

834
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,520
Your team has a chance.

835
00:41:25,279 --> 00:41:26,839
If you can't go on,

836
00:41:27,279 --> 00:41:28,399
We welcome you here.

837
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,080
You can't wait for that day.

838
00:41:32,919 --> 00:41:33,879
Take care of yourself.

839
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:40,120
You too.

840
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,760
Are old friends.

841
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,319
Let's have dinner and sing tonight. It's my treat.

842
00:41:46,919 --> 00:41:47,680
Let's go.

843
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:49,200
bye-bye

844
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,520
Always contact me.

845
00:41:57,799 --> 00:41:58,439
Kai

846
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:00,200
What happened to you today?

847
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,560
I can't fight anymore.

848
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,439
Find another one.
