1
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:08,661
Sorry

2
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:08,981
Brother

3
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:10,941
Your computer was taken away by dad.

4
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:12,380
You know that.

5
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:14,461
No one can find what he hid.

6
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,621
If there is no accident,

7
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,261
These two days,

8
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:22,061
There should be someone named Xiao Feng.

9
00:02:22,461 --> 00:02:23,980
I don't want to go to the game.

10
00:02:25,901 --> 00:02:27,741
You must listen to him.

11
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,901
I don't want to talk to you in front of the camera.

12
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,701
I want you to come back.

13
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:39,580
Sitting at the table,

14
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,741
Eat the beef sauce made by Dad with me.

15
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:42,820
After the meal,

16
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,381
We'll go to the crossfire.

17
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:46,021
You can pick any map.

18
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:51,540
Come back, brother.

19
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:55,620
Come back.

20
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,820
Is the qualifying result out?

21
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,421
Not yet.

22
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:05,021
It's almost there.

23
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:08,940
dang!

24
00:03:09,061 --> 00:03:09,980
Why did you meet them?

25
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:10,861
The bullet head.

26
00:03:11,221 --> 00:03:12,820
Is the Bullet Team strong?

27
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,900
Why are you reacting so strongly?

28
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,260
Brother Kai's team fought them before.

29
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:18,900
Tortured with blood.

30
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,620
You are so talkative, right?

31
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,021
Make fun of

32
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:24,381
The bullets are steady.

33
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,060
Their captain, Stone.

34
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,980
I used to be a soldier.

35
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,620
I've fought with real guns.

36
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,221
Actual combat and game are two different things.

37
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,420
Let's watch their game video first.

38
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,060
Five of them are like real special forces.

39
00:03:43,221 --> 00:03:44,141
Cover for each other.

40
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,340
marksmanship

41
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,540
The use of all kinds of props

42
00:04:22,461 --> 00:04:23,541
And has the ability to adapt.

43
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,141
Are all top-notch.

44
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,701
Oh, my God.

45
00:04:37,701 --> 00:04:38,541
The marksmanship is so abnormal.

46
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,100
Tell me everything.

47
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,500
What's the best way?

48
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,701
I'd say it's straight forward.

49
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:42,340
No one is afraid.

50
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:43,900
The result is to lose.

51
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,301
You lost so badly last time.

52
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:46,141
You haven't learned a lesson yet.

53
00:04:46,141 --> 00:04:47,380
Don't scare yourself.

54
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,340
Besides,

55
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,421
I don't think this team is that strong.

56
00:04:50,421 --> 00:04:51,141
yes

57
00:04:51,701 --> 00:04:52,500
that is

58
00:04:52,861 --> 00:04:53,741
The data is better than ours.

59
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:54,821
You have more experience than us.

60
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:56,220
If you cooperate,

61
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,541
Is stronger than us.

62
00:04:57,821 --> 00:04:58,500
How many times?

63
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,421
I'm telling you,

64
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,821
The rest of us can handle it.

65
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:02,581
This stone is terrible.

66
00:05:02,581 --> 00:05:06,141
The action of MA4 will be like nothing else.

67
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,500
Nezha, protection deity

68
00:05:07,821 --> 00:05:08,780
You just shot him.

69
00:05:09,261 --> 00:05:10,060
Are you sure?

70
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,301
no

71
00:05:21,741 --> 00:05:22,301
have to

72
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,861
That's not right.

73
00:05:24,861 --> 00:05:25,981
What do you think?

74
00:05:33,421 --> 00:05:34,861
What if Brother Monkey leaves?

75
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:37,500
Why don't you talk to the monkey wife?

76
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,780
The competition is only half a month away.

77
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,900
If we lose again,

78
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,981
If the team doesn't pass the test,

79
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,141
For half a month.

80
00:05:43,741 --> 00:05:44,380
let it be

81
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,981
I knew he would leave.

82
00:05:46,261 --> 00:05:47,060
How do you know?

83
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:48,981
And calculate it.

84
00:05:51,981 --> 00:05:53,861
Then do the math.

85
00:05:54,261 --> 00:05:55,900
Who are about the same age as us.

86
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,541
I've already asked.

87
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,500
She has stopped playing.

88
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,141
And younger than us.

89
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,900
You don't want to join us.

90
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,461
Nothing

91
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,981
Keep looking for him.

92
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:27,141
go

93
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,660
other

94
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:48,420
What about them?

95
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,420
Where is she?

96
00:06:49,621 --> 00:06:50,181
go

97
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,780
Don't chase me.

98
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:56,701
other

99
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,061
How to do it?

100
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,181
Why are you embarrassed?

101
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,381
No

102
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:16,860
This game is hard.

103
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,420
It's not difficult.

104
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:19,860
come

105
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,501
I'll teach you.

106
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:22,501
Open the computer.

107
00:07:25,501 --> 00:07:26,300
Hold the mouse tightly.

108
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:29,021
Don't hold it so tightly.

109
00:07:29,141 --> 00:07:30,740
Be gentle.

110
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,340
Here's the thing.

111
00:07:31,621 --> 00:07:31,780
Yes

112
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,220
such

113
00:07:32,381 --> 00:07:32,780
Yes

114
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,340
What should we do now?

115
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:36,181
W A S D

116
00:07:36,381 --> 00:07:37,061
You have to move.

117
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:38,141
How can you play if you don't move?

118
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,261
Mouse wrist

119
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:39,701
Move.

120
00:07:39,701 --> 00:07:40,100
good

121
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:41,860
No

122
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,860
You'll get cramps if you shake like this.

123
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,821
Why don't you do that?

124
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:44,021
Don't move.

125
00:07:44,021 --> 00:07:44,261
such

126
00:07:44,581 --> 00:07:44,900
He's here.

127
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,860
There are people in front of him.

128
00:07:47,821 --> 00:07:48,141
left

129
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:48,621
You...

130
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:49,181
Don't be nervous.

131
00:07:49,181 --> 00:07:49,780
To your left,

132
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:50,300
Call me again.

133
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:50,780
Nothing

134
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,381
She's here.

135
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:52,141
Go ahead.

136
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,100
Don't panic. It's okay.

137
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,540
Another one.

138
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:40,100
This game is really hard.

139
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,340
It's not hard to master the skills.

140
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,340
Your feet.

141
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,181
good

142
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:51,621
Don't you hate playing games?

143
00:08:51,621 --> 00:08:52,141
Yes

144
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:54,261
I used to think the standard of the game

145
00:08:54,261 --> 00:08:55,340
Is fighting and killing.

146
00:08:56,061 --> 00:08:57,900
But I've been reading your notes these two days.

147
00:08:58,181 --> 00:08:59,261
I found that many places

148
00:08:59,261 --> 00:09:00,581
Is very similar to mathematical probability.

149
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:01,860
For example,

150
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,660
The time and distance of his opponent's arrival

151
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,660
And various tactics.

152
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,021
The most interesting thing is a lot of things.

153
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:07,581
It can be verified by calculation.

154
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,740
Do you really want to learn?

155
00:09:16,581 --> 00:09:17,261
How about this?

156
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,621
The atmosphere is bad.

157
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:21,701
Come here.

158
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,261
I'll take you to a place.

159
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:46,300
Is it formal here?

160
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,181
Of course it's official.

161
00:09:47,181 --> 00:09:48,141
It's time to go.

162
00:09:48,261 --> 00:09:50,141
It's irregular here.

163
00:09:50,141 --> 00:09:50,701
What are you talking about?

164
00:09:50,701 --> 00:09:52,181
The hair salon outside is irregular. I don't know.

165
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,340
My Internet café is regular.

166
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,261
There's a business license.

167
00:09:56,021 --> 00:09:56,381
Go inside.

168
00:09:57,621 --> 00:09:58,860
Stop watching. Play games.

169
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:00,621
I'll hit you again.

170
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,900
What should we do now?

171
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,261
You only need to do one thing now.

172
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,340
what

173
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,261
Relax

174
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:11,941
Board the game.

175
00:10:12,461 --> 00:10:13,181
Where is it?

176
00:10:16,461 --> 00:10:17,821
Individual Sports Three Channel 5.

177
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,461
Room Seven.

178
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:30,141
This is

179
00:10:30,621 --> 00:10:30,980
Don't look.

180
00:10:31,821 --> 00:10:32,860
I didn't notice that

181
00:10:33,021 --> 00:10:33,821
It's interesting.

182
00:10:34,821 --> 00:10:36,021
Okay, don't be nervous.

183
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,661
This is the game world.

184
00:10:37,661 --> 00:10:38,781
You can do whatever you want here.

185
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,541
Come on.

186
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,140
I'll teach you the basic skills.

187
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:41,980
go

188
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:45,620
Let's go.

189
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,020
I can't walk.

190
00:10:49,661 --> 00:10:50,421
W is leaving.

191
00:11:04,461 --> 00:11:05,340
What are you doing?

192
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,100
How about turning?

193
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,020
A is for turning.

194
00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:09,581
S is for retreating.

195
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,140
In the future

196
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:10,781
S

197
00:11:12,581 --> 00:11:13,500
A is turning left.

198
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,181
Now we need to practice the basic operation.

199
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:16,740
W

200
00:11:17,701 --> 00:11:18,140
S

201
00:11:19,941 --> 00:11:20,701
A is to the left.

202
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,421
A

203
00:11:22,821 --> 00:11:23,500
D is to the right.

204
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,061
D

205
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:25,661
Stop

206
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:27,220
Space is a jump.

207
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:27,860
Blank space

208
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,020
Make it stronger.

209
00:11:29,421 --> 00:11:29,941
Blank space

210
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:30,980
Ctrl is a squat.

211
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,500
hurry up

212
00:11:33,581 --> 00:11:34,461
I'll teach you a new one.

213
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:35,140
Watch this.

214
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,340
How did you get there?

215
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,380
That's what I taught you.

216
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,380
Space plus Ctrl

217
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:45,500
But you have to hold W first.

218
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,140
There must be a sprint.

219
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,140
Try it on the spot.

220
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:48,941
The space CTRL is to shrink the legs.

221
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,380
One, two, three.

222
00:11:51,701 --> 00:11:52,301
Space Ctrl

223
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:53,781
pretty

224
00:11:53,941 --> 00:11:54,620
This time,

225
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:55,980
Before you jump,

226
00:11:56,421 --> 00:11:57,901
You need a sprint. Hold W.

227
00:11:57,901 --> 00:11:59,740
It's W space plus CTRL.

228
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,661
Remember that?

229
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,781
You're a female soldier.

230
00:12:02,781 --> 00:12:03,500
Make it stronger.

231
00:12:03,701 --> 00:12:04,301
good

232
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,140
I told you to jump up.

233
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,220
I didn't ask you to jump into the sea.

234
00:12:23,181 --> 00:12:24,860
You're a perfect student. You usually learn things fast.

235
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,661
Why are you playing games?

236
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,260
Come on.

237
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,020
You're back.

238
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,340
We are going to practice shooting.

239
00:12:36,061 --> 00:12:36,581
Next

240
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,461
Guns are for our own protection.

241
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:43,661
How could it fall on the floor?

242
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,620
How can you fight the enemy without a gun?

243
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:46,340
Pick it up.

244
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,581
Come here

245
00:12:51,581 --> 00:12:52,661
See those three bottles?

246
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,701
Shoot them.

247
00:13:08,181 --> 00:13:08,901
You know how to take a gun?

248
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:11,740
Okay, let's hit the bottle this time.

249
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,340
Hold the gun.

250
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,781
Aim

251
00:13:15,901 --> 00:13:16,500
To draw breath

252
00:13:16,821 --> 00:13:17,541
Three points and one line.

253
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,140
You're a perfect student.

254
00:13:28,581 --> 00:13:29,500
We don't practice shooting anymore.

255
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:30,941
Let's practice this.

256
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,100
What is this?

257
00:13:33,661 --> 00:13:34,061
Throw the thunder.

258
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,701
Your four fingers

259
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,340
Hold it here.

260
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:42,020
Open the ring.

261
00:13:43,581 --> 00:13:44,260
Not now.

262
00:13:45,061 --> 00:13:45,980
When you open the ring,

263
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,340
You can't let go of these four fingers.

264
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,821
And aim where you want to throw it.

265
00:13:48,821 --> 00:13:49,980
Throw it hard.

266
00:13:50,421 --> 00:13:51,181
Got it?

267
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,260
Understood

268
00:14:11,781 --> 00:14:13,500
Sorry, I'm too stupid.

269
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,181
What did you say

270
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,220
I'm sorry. I was too stupid.

271
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,980
You're talented.

272
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,181
What did you say

273
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,340
let it be

274
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:58,980
Have a try.

275
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,620
eldest brother

276
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:01,500
Don't just chat with girls here.

277
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,061
If you have the ability to fight,

278
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:03,980
Namely

279
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,380
No

280
00:15:04,941 --> 00:15:06,821
We're just here to learn about the game.

281
00:15:06,821 --> 00:15:07,740
Novice

282
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:09,701
Don't be a coward.

283
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,461
What I just said is not sensible.

284
00:15:12,461 --> 00:15:13,901
Seems to be very powerful?

285
00:15:13,901 --> 00:15:14,901
When it comes to actual combat,

286
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,020
If you don't have confidence,

287
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,061
I don't mind it.

288
00:15:18,061 --> 00:15:19,781
I'll teach you a pretty girl.

289
00:15:19,901 --> 00:15:20,661
How to shoot?

290
00:15:20,661 --> 00:15:21,260
Yes, I will teach you.

291
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:21,860
We can also teach

292
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:23,701
other

293
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,581
We're all newbies. Don't do this.

294
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:26,340
Xiao Feng.

295
00:15:26,581 --> 00:15:27,461
Fight with them.

296
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:29,980
Really?

297
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:30,620
hit

298
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,140
Pretty girl, you're angry.

299
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,421
How about this?

300
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,301
We are both newbies.

301
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,941
I only know how to play transport.

302
00:15:38,941 --> 00:15:40,061
Or we'll take a transport ship.

303
00:15:40,901 --> 00:15:41,541
You two,

304
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:43,901
Hit the three of us.

305
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,340
Give it a try.

306
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:45,860
a row

307
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,620
I'm tired today.

308
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,701
I'll teach you.

309
00:15:48,701 --> 00:15:50,941
Why are you living in the crossfire?

310
00:16:08,941 --> 00:16:09,901
Go around.

311
00:16:10,461 --> 00:16:11,500
You're in the middle.

312
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,380
Stay close.

313
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:21,421
After a while,

314
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:22,220
Will outflank us from the back.

315
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,821
How do you know?

316
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:24,901
Two o'clock.

317
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,140
Where

318
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:26,980
behind

319
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:27,980
behind

320
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:29,620
It's not your back.

321
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,020
Is the back of the game.

322
00:16:31,781 --> 00:16:32,781
Don't point your gun at me.

323
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:33,941
Calm down.

324
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,740
What now?

325
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,061
Don't worry.

326
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:41,701
I'm here.

327
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:19,821
What should we do now?

328
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:23,701
AnLuan

329
00:17:24,661 --> 00:17:25,220
Fight.

330
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:27,020
Shoot

331
00:17:27,461 --> 00:17:27,821
I

332
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:28,860
I can't.

333
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,860
I forgot how to drive it.

334
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:33,061
I can't.

335
00:17:33,461 --> 00:17:33,901
Shoot!

336
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,100
AnLuan

337
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,100
You're so ugly.

338
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,901
Xiao Feng, what are you talking about?

339
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:46,860
You're ugly.

340
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,860
Xiao Feng.

341
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,901
We won.

342
00:18:13,901 --> 00:18:14,620
You must.

343
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,701
What are you doing?

344
00:18:20,781 --> 00:18:21,701
That's right.

345
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,220
How did you figure out that

346
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,461
From behind us.

347
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,901
You don't need to know.

348
00:18:25,901 --> 00:18:27,541
They wanted to sneak up on us from the beginning.

349
00:18:27,781 --> 00:18:29,100
Give me something and I'll take the bait.

350
00:18:31,461 --> 00:18:33,181
So you used psychology.

351
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,980
Don't raise everything to

352
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,941
The height of learning.

353
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,581
It's like playing with those sand bags when I was young.

354
00:18:38,581 --> 00:18:39,740
What are you talking about?

355
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:40,941
Are you still playing?

356
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:41,740
play

357
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,140
You haven't finished the map yet.

358
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,220
Why are you still in the toilet?

359
00:18:58,461 --> 00:19:00,100
Why is the toilet always broken?

360
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,740
Can you call the property management?

361
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,661
Tell him to fix it.

362
00:19:02,661 --> 00:19:04,100
Look at my sweat.

363
00:19:04,421 --> 00:19:05,301
I know.

364
00:19:07,421 --> 00:19:08,661
Xiao Bei, I'm leaving.

365
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,701
Take a bag of rice with you after work.

366
00:19:10,701 --> 00:19:11,181
good

367
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,421
Let's go.

368
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:45,661
Wait

369
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:49,421
Are you going out?

370
00:19:51,101 --> 00:19:53,020
I went to the school to make an appointment with my classmates.

371
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:58,220
Today is the first match of the Hundred Cities League.

372
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,701
Where are you going?

373
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,421
Go to the bathroom.

374
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:09,260
Cellphones /Mobile Phones

375
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,500
Put the phone down.

376
00:20:24,381 --> 00:20:25,181
Nothing

377
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,421
Xiao Bei hasn't answered the phone.

378
00:20:32,141 --> 00:20:33,060
She didn't answer the phone.

379
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:33,820
What are you doing?

380
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,661
I was so anxious.

381
00:20:35,181 --> 00:20:35,861
What time is it?

382
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:37,260
It's 9: 25.

383
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:37,980
Hold on tight.

384
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,421
Xiao Bei, we're here.

385
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:42,621
here

386
00:20:42,621 --> 00:20:43,421
Right here.

387
00:20:44,141 --> 00:20:45,500
Go to the back and pick up Xiao Bei. I'll leave from here.

388
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,220
good

389
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:16,820
Xiaobei

390
00:21:18,181 --> 00:21:18,861
What's up

391
00:21:19,181 --> 00:21:20,461
Xiao Bei was taken away by his father again.

392
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,580
to get on or into

393
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:23,260
Go after him.

394
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:27,141
fast

395
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,421
What's up

396
00:21:28,901 --> 00:21:29,540
There's no oil.

397
00:21:31,181 --> 00:21:32,260
how could that be?

398
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:33,300
What can we do

399
00:21:33,661 --> 00:21:34,220
Go to the cyber cafe first.

400
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,101
Go to the cyber cafe.

401
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:35,621
Yes

402
00:21:35,621 --> 00:21:36,621
How can I play without Xiao Bei?

403
00:21:37,141 --> 00:21:38,461
The internet cafe is several kilometers away.

404
00:21:38,461 --> 00:21:39,701
One is better than three.

405
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,181
go

406
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,500
Run.

407
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:42,820
to take a taxi

408
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,780
The car is gone.

409
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,341
go

410
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,020
The road team.

411
00:21:50,941 --> 00:21:51,341
Xiaobei

412
00:22:08,181 --> 00:22:09,540
Just learn in front of me.

413
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,461
Don't go anywhere.

414
00:22:16,341 --> 00:22:16,941
feed

415
00:22:20,101 --> 00:22:20,500
a row

416
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,341
I'll be right there.

417
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,621
I'm an adult.

418
00:22:55,621 --> 00:22:56,220
You...

419
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,220
I

420
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,381
Watch him for me.

421
00:23:04,381 --> 00:23:05,260
I'm going out to do something.

422
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:05,941
I'll be back soon.

423
00:23:06,141 --> 00:23:06,461
good

424
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,901
Don't worry.

425
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:15,300
The competition will begin soon.

426
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,461
What do you think now?

427
00:23:32,461 --> 00:23:33,621
Can we postpone the game?

428
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:36,421
The committee said we must be on time.

429
00:23:36,901 --> 00:23:37,540
otherwise

430
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,861
With a waiver.

431
00:23:39,901 --> 00:23:41,141
Why should we give up?

432
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:43,621
I'll find someone to take over.

433
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,701
Go find someone.

434
00:23:49,141 --> 00:23:49,740
Little brother.

435
00:23:50,101 --> 00:23:51,701
Do me a favor.

436
00:23:51,701 --> 00:23:52,740
come

437
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,500
Help us fight.

438
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,500
I won't.

439
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,621
You won't. I'll teach you.

440
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,461
come

441
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,300
fast

442
00:24:10,461 --> 00:24:11,260
Can you play?

443
00:24:11,861 --> 00:24:12,740
Can you play?

444
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,621
Yes, sorry.

445
00:24:13,621 --> 00:24:14,060
Kai

446
00:24:14,141 --> 00:24:15,020
What are you doing?

447
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,461
He is here to help.

448
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,300
Don't be angry.

449
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,780
I know he helped.

450
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,580
I can see that.

451
00:24:19,701 --> 00:24:20,980
He didn't even open his eyes to play.

452
00:24:21,181 --> 00:24:22,540
He helped the bullet.

453
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,300
Enough.

454
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,540
Are you here for a fight?

455
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,661
You should go out.

456
00:24:25,661 --> 00:24:26,740
Don't embarrass yourself here.

457
00:24:28,421 --> 00:24:29,461
It's okay. Come on.

458
00:24:36,901 --> 00:24:37,980
Don't you have a fever?

459
00:24:39,621 --> 00:24:40,820
I'm serious.

460
00:24:41,421 --> 00:24:42,220
other

461
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,580
I really can't stand you.

462
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,780
Just give me a chance.

463
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,901
We only played once.

464
00:24:52,621 --> 00:24:53,580
Why are you still in love with

465
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,701
I don't know either

466
00:24:57,421 --> 00:24:59,621
I think it might be an intuition.

467
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:01,901
to stop

468
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:03,020
I'm not used to this.

469
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,901
You will get used to it.

470
00:25:05,901 --> 00:25:06,421
Really

471
00:25:10,901 --> 00:25:12,500
You really need an agent like me.

472
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,580
I think

473
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,260
You should take the postgraduate exam.

474
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,540
It's more reliable to find a job.

475
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,701
This is my new job.

476
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,421
I have no money to pay you.

477
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,901
You don't have to pay me.

478
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,020
After you win the national championship,

479
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:28,661
Just share the bonus with me.

480
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:29,540
The teams abroad

481
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,621
The managers are all paid by bonus shares.

482
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,901
This is also the practice of the game industry.

483
00:25:34,941 --> 00:25:35,941
Do you know anything about games?

484
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:38,701
Someone said that

485
00:25:38,701 --> 00:25:40,901
Man's inventions can be boiled down to two kinds

486
00:25:41,181 --> 00:25:42,701
The first is to save time for mankind.

487
00:25:42,701 --> 00:25:44,820
The second is to waste the time saved

488
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,461
We call the first material civilization

489
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:47,901
The second is called spiritual civilization.

490
00:25:47,901 --> 00:25:49,580
The earliest video games were born

491
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,461
On the vacuum computer in 1952,

492
00:25:51,461 --> 00:25:52,780
Thirty years after TV.

493
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,740
It's 60 years later than the film.

494
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,141
800 years later than modern football.

495
00:25:55,141 --> 00:25:55,901
But now,

496
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:57,780
The global video game industry

497
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,381
Has been able to

498
00:25:59,381 --> 00:26:01,580
And competitive sports such as football.

499
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,980
Called human spiritual civilization.

500
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,780
One of the most important output methods.

501
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,941
Although video games

502
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:07,260
In the country.

503
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,621
But an important carrier of modern video games

504
00:26:09,621 --> 00:26:10,621
It's a network technology.

505
00:26:10,621 --> 00:26:12,101
Development speed and influence

506
00:26:12,101 --> 00:26:12,780
In China,

507
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,220
It has far exceeded that of foreign countries.

508
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,861
Even the developed countries in Europe and America.

509
00:26:16,181 --> 00:26:17,740
So it is predictable that

510
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,941
In the near future,

511
00:26:19,101 --> 00:26:21,300
Video games will develop rapidly in China.

512
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,220
But the unpredictable thing is,

513
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,101
I don't know how fast it will be.

514
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:29,740
I want to know why we invited you.

515
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,780
To be our manager.

516
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,621
in fact

517
00:26:31,621 --> 00:26:33,621
My position is closer to the leader.

518
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,820
Like the leaders of basketball and football teams.

519
00:26:35,901 --> 00:26:36,740
To help you take care of it.

520
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,181
Except for the game,

521
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,661
We don't need a nanny.

522
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:41,020
But if this nanny

523
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,421
Can be calculated scientifically.

524
00:26:42,421 --> 00:26:43,901
To help you find the most suitable teammates.

525
00:26:43,901 --> 00:26:45,101
To improve the efficiency of your training.

526
00:26:45,341 --> 00:26:47,101
And even collect opponent's data.

527
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:48,621
To predict the opponent's tactics.

528
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,181
The killing rate of these people

529
00:26:53,181 --> 00:26:54,901
And the record are excellent.

530
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,861
Is a master of the Internet café.

531
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:57,861
Are all from Ningjiang.

532
00:26:57,861 --> 00:26:58,740
Without a regular job.

533
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,580
It can replace the position of the monkey.

534
00:27:04,901 --> 00:27:06,141
Where did you find these?

535
00:27:06,381 --> 00:27:08,181
Through the fire, Ning Jiang District.

536
00:27:08,181 --> 00:27:09,861
I've checked every post.

537
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,101
Professionals should do professional things.

538
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,780
Then you can get twice the result with half the effort.

539
00:27:14,141 --> 00:27:16,181
You are really good at the game.

540
00:27:16,421 --> 00:27:18,341
But for things outside the game,

541
00:27:18,461 --> 00:27:20,220
You are all Xiao Bai.

542
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:21,661
What about

543
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,580
I'll give you a good lesson.

544
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,300
Miss An.

545
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,101
How about two more?

546
00:27:29,461 --> 00:27:30,500
I want to learn better.

547
00:27:31,101 --> 00:27:31,701
no problem

548
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:32,820
What are you doing?

549
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,421
You mean him?

550
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:37,980
how could that be?

551
00:27:38,181 --> 00:27:39,341
I practiced a little bit.

552
00:27:39,341 --> 00:27:39,861
then

553
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,341
Ming went out to buy cigarettes again.

554
00:27:41,341 --> 00:27:42,780
He hasn't come back yet.

555
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,500
It's been a long time.

556
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,381
He didn't bring his phone with him.

557
00:27:44,381 --> 00:27:45,341
We came out to look for her.

558
00:27:45,341 --> 00:27:46,300
The owner of the shop said

559
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,381
He bought a pack of cigarettes and left.

560
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,661
Isn't he good?

561
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,780
He didn't take anything.

562
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,421
Is there anything wrong?

563
00:27:50,421 --> 00:27:51,060
I have no idea

564
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,621
Let's go there and have a look.

565
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,220
Xiao Feng.

566
00:27:58,461 --> 00:27:58,941
here

567
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:12,701
He was kidnapped.

568
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,300
To the last address.

569
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,141
Everything is here.

570
00:28:42,141 --> 00:28:43,020
Pack it yourself.

571
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,701
The cost is 20 yuan.

572
00:28:43,701 --> 00:28:44,421
I'll transfer it to you later.

573
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,181
good

574
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:49,861
Brothers!

575
00:28:50,101 --> 00:28:50,701
Brothers!

576
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:52,901
Can you do me a favor?

577
00:28:53,141 --> 00:28:53,980
What business?

578
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,381
You sent me to a place.

579
00:28:55,381 --> 00:28:55,980
I'll give you 200 yuan.

580
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:56,861
To you on WeChat.

581
00:28:57,141 --> 00:28:57,861
sorry

582
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,901
working hours

583
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:00,101
You didn't pick up the personal order.

584
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:01,980
Wait a second.

585
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:02,701
How about this?

586
00:29:02,861 --> 00:29:03,540
I sent the parcel.

587
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,500
What?

588
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,341
Brother, turn left at the junction ahead.

589
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,540
Let's go to the Sky Cyber Cafe.

590
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,220
You sent the parcel.

591
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,701
To the company for delivery.

592
00:29:14,661 --> 00:29:16,060
Can't you send me there?

593
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,540
Why are you so stubborn?

594
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,820
It's the company's policy.

595
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,861
I have no choice.

596

Can you help me find a wheelchair now?

607
00:29:47,421 --> 00:29:49,020
To Zhonghua Street.

608
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,020
The Martial Arts Master saved Chu.

609
00:29:52,421 --> 00:29:53,260
Where's your wheelchair?

610
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:54,941
Please.

611
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,580
You must deliver it.

612
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,461

613
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,500

What's wrong with you?

618
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:22,421
No

619
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,181
Didn't I ask you to help me find a wheelchair?

620
00:30:24,421 --> 00:30:24,820
you

621
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,141
I can find someone with wheels.

622
00:30:27,141 --> 00:30:27,901
This is the only one.

623
00:30:28,621 --> 00:30:29,540
What's the result of five kilometers?

624
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,260
About 18. What's wrong?

625
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,580
It's not too late.

626
00:30:32,861 --> 00:30:33,861
Take me to the Sky Cyber Cafe.

627
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,020
I'm not going.

628
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,901
I will train later.

629
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:36,300
Go yourself.

630
00:30:36,941 --> 00:30:37,661
Last night

631
00:30:38,141 --> 00:30:38,980
The big question of Literature Synthesis

632
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:39,901
I'll teach you.

633
00:30:56,941 --> 00:30:57,580
Be careful

634
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,060
Be careful.

635
00:30:59,181 --> 00:31:00,101
Be careful

636
00:31:01,141 --> 00:31:02,220
Excuse me.

637
00:31:03,701 --> 00:31:05,500
Where are you going? Over there.

638
00:31:05,901 --> 00:31:06,901
Turn right.

639
00:31:12,421 --> 00:31:13,300
This is the place.

640
00:31:14,181 --> 00:31:15,540
Don't hit me.

641
00:31:16,901 --> 00:31:17,341
here

642
00:31:18,181 --> 00:31:19,740
Cheng Hao, how did you fill the position?

643
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,381
It's like a colander.

644
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:22,141
You're right.

645
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:23,701
If you don't know, who did you take money from?

646
00:31:23,701 --> 00:31:25,101
I can't carry the pot alone.

647
00:31:25,461 --> 00:31:26,701
Nezha went to rob the head.

648
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,300
Can we avoid being attacked?

649
00:31:28,661 --> 00:31:29,941
Nezha, I'm telling you.

650
00:31:30,141 --> 00:31:30,901
If you lose again,

651
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:32,381
I won't pay you.

652
00:31:32,861 --> 00:31:33,820
Did you hear that?

653
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:34,941
no

654
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,580
here

655
00:31:37,101 --> 00:31:38,181
I'm here.

656
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,621
Brother, you're finally here.

657
00:31:41,621 --> 00:31:42,381
Chu song

658
00:31:44,381 --> 00:31:45,300
Why are you changing trains?

659
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,580
Dude, thank you.

660
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,941
Thank you for leaving.

661
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,381
Thank you, Nan.

662
00:31:49,381 --> 00:31:50,260
What's the situation now?

663
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,300
We lost the first round.

664
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,861
It's already 2-7 in the first half.

665
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,300
It's useless for you to come now.

666
00:31:55,101 --> 00:31:56,101
The opposite must think so.

667
00:31:56,341 --> 00:31:57,861
They are leading by both scores.

668
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,220
Would want to eat us.

669
00:31:59,701 --> 00:32:00,461
to accept

670
00:32:00,461 --> 00:32:01,820
Keep your mind steady, keep your marksmanship steady.

671
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:02,861
Let's fight steadily.

672
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:03,820
And hit him in the dark.

673
00:32:03,941 --> 00:32:04,540
I see.

674
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,820
How to kill them.

675
00:32:05,901 --> 00:32:06,701
What are you doing?

676
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,220
No matter what,

677
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,461
It's a good way to turn the table.

678
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,260
I just watched the game live.

679
00:32:11,701 --> 00:32:12,820
The opponent is not as strong as I thought.

680
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:14,820
Nezha, protection deity

681
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,500
Stay close to me.

682
00:32:22,101 --> 00:32:23,621
Nezha, go to the middle of the road.

683
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:25,141
Wang Kai, S + 1, guard B.

684
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,020
Cheng Hao, follow me.

685
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:26,461
good

686
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,260
Nezha, don't shoot.

687
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,260
Wait until I pull it out.

688
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,500
I dropped it.

689
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,141
Kill one.

690
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,260
Come on

691
00:32:54,461 --> 00:32:55,461
The middle two went to B.

692
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,381
Cheng Hao, go to support.

693
00:32:57,661 --> 00:32:58,101
good

694
00:32:58,461 --> 00:32:59,220
Su Jiayi has hidden it.

695
00:32:59,220 --> 00:32:59,941
I'm here to help you.

696
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,461
B, three.

697
00:33:10,461 --> 00:33:11,260
I dropped it.

698
00:33:16,701 --> 00:33:17,381
I dropped it too.

699
00:33:17,381 --> 00:33:18,341
Are the three of them in B?

700
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,060
in

701
00:33:28,181 --> 00:33:28,780
Be careful

702
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:36,780
One

703
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,101
Come on

704
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:40,701
Two

705
00:33:40,701 --> 00:33:41,101
pretty

706
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:45,780
pretty

707
00:33:52,101 --> 00:33:52,820
ten

708
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,740
nine

709
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,300
eight

710
00:33:56,901 --> 00:34:03,980
Seven, six, five, three, two.

711
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,621
Did you win?

712
00:34:10,621 --> 00:34:11,540
You must.

713
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,780
It's too six, Xiao Bei.

714
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,701
The game hasn't been won yet.

715
00:34:16,861 --> 00:34:17,621
Calm down.

716
00:34:17,621 --> 00:34:19,341
The man who attacked us rashly just now

717
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:20,381
good

718
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,580
Let's repeat the tactics.

719
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:29,980
A, two.

720
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:30,980
Wang Kai, cover me.

721
00:34:31,181 --> 00:34:31,621
Received

722
00:34:31,621 --> 00:34:32,701
Nezha, go with me to support B.

723
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:34,540
fall

724
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,260
pretty

725
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,701
Hurry up. There are two left at B.

726
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:38,980
There's one in the middle.

727
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:39,820
I lost the middle road.

728
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,381
pretty

729
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,861
Press on.

730
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,181
One off.

731
00:34:44,181 --> 00:34:44,701
pretty

732
00:34:44,701 --> 00:34:45,220
pretty

733
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:45,580
Nice gun.

734
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,260
There's one missing from Alley A.

735
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,260
Good gun S + 1.

736
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:50,740
pretty

737
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,540
pretty

738
00:34:53,421 --> 00:34:54,220
I'm the only one left.

739
00:34:54,341 --> 00:34:54,861
Hold on.

740
00:34:54,861 --> 00:34:55,701
He's here.

741
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,500
There's another one under the bridge.

742
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,461
Under the bridge,

743
00:35:05,461 --> 00:35:05,901
good

744
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,381
A, three.

745
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,701
Come on.

746
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,260
Received

747
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,020
A is gone.

748
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,220
uncle

749
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,181
That's nice. Nice gun.

750
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:36,941
A dog drops one.

751
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:37,701
pretty

752
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,421
Guard the bag. We'll guard it.

753
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,580
Received

754
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,941
I'm disabled.

755
00:35:41,941 --> 00:35:43,220
Seal the smoke.

756
00:35:43,381 --> 00:35:43,820
good

757
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,500
He's here.

758
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,060
Behind the box,

759
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,580
Who? Who is it?

760
00:35:57,701 --> 00:35:58,421
He's here.

761
00:35:58,661 --> 00:36:00,300
Behind the box,

762
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,621
Are you stupid?

763
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,820
Don't you have to be positive?

764
00:36:12,901 --> 00:36:13,741
A is small.

765
00:36:13,941 --> 00:36:14,341
Nice gun.

766
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:15,660
fall

767
00:36:25,221 --> 00:36:25,620
pretty

768
00:36:26,861 --> 00:36:27,381
uncle

769
00:36:27,821 --> 00:36:28,901
Are you here to see Xiao Bei?

770
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,781
He often practices here.

771
00:36:32,781 --> 00:36:33,901
I'll guard the bag.

772
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:34,540
Received

773
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,620
Nezha, come and support me.

774
00:36:36,221 --> 00:36:37,580
I know you don't like him to play games.

775
00:36:38,221 --> 00:36:38,901
actually

776
00:36:39,341 --> 00:36:41,221
Xiao Bei doesn't have the same character as Xiao

777
00:36:41,781 --> 00:36:42,941
But after a fight,

778
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,261
Look at that look.

779
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:46,821
That look.

780
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,741
And those little tricks.

781
00:36:57,461 --> 00:36:58,341
It's so similar.

782
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,700
It's the same mold.

783
00:37:12,261 --> 00:37:12,741
Nothing

784
00:37:12,741 --> 00:37:13,540
We should keep our attitude.

785
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:16,700
Nothing

786
00:37:17,221 --> 00:37:18,060
I'm on top.

787
00:37:18,301 --> 00:37:19,781
They lost their rhythm.

788
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:20,620
We'll guard our points.

789
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,301
They can't get in.

790
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,180
Hold still

791
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:22,980
This one can win.

792
00:37:25,421 --> 00:37:26,540
Nezha, go with me to support B.

793
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:27,821
I'll cover you from the back.

794
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,941
The middle one.

795
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:29,620
good

796
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:30,301
I lost the middle road.

797
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:30,980
pretty

798
00:37:31,261 --> 00:37:31,660
I'll spy one.

799
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,180
pretty

800
00:37:33,941 --> 00:37:34,700
A The dog is gone.

801
00:37:53,221 --> 00:37:53,861
Don't tell him.

802
00:37:53,861 --> 00:37:54,500
I've been here.

803
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,620
A sealed smoke.

804
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:00,980
Nice gun.

805
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,461
Go on. Long live the team.

806
00:38:32,861 --> 00:38:33,781
Xiao Bei, you're too young.

807
00:38:33,781 --> 00:38:34,861
You're too sharp.

808
00:38:36,261 --> 00:38:36,901
We won.

809
00:39:03,461 --> 00:39:04,421
pretty

810
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,901
Give way. Follow us.

811
00:39:05,941 --> 00:39:06,861
Victory in the first battle

812
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,821
It's not easy to turn the table.

813
00:39:08,821 --> 00:39:09,941
We've finally turned the corner.

814
00:39:09,941 --> 00:39:11,221
How did you hit him?

815
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,781
I will spy on you.

816
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,221
Your gun is really good.

817
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,221
It's okay. I'm telling you.

818
00:39:18,221 --> 00:39:19,580
We've turned the table.

819
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:21,580
We've turned the table.

820
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,221
It's amazing.

821
00:39:35,341 --> 00:39:36,180
You played well.

822
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,660
hand

823
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,461
I thought you had left.

824
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,261
I didn't expect you were still here.

825
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:01,421
They hurt

826
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,261
I'm here to take the shopping cart.

827
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,180
My dad is here.

828
00:40:31,261 --> 00:40:32,461
It's you again.

829
00:40:32,461 --> 00:40:33,861
Who did you offend this time?

830
00:40:33,861 --> 00:40:34,980
We really didn't offend anyone.

831
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,301
Close the team.

832
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,100
Our friend was caught by the underworld.

833
00:40:37,261 --> 00:40:38,100
Wearing a hood.

834
00:40:38,381 --> 00:40:40,140
Check the license plate number of this van first.

835
00:40:40,461 --> 00:40:41,620
Did you get the phone records?

836
00:40:41,901 --> 00:40:42,381
Not yet.

837
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,540
Where is Ming's family?

838
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,461
Xiao Zhang is trying to contact him.

839
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,020
Team Guan found it.

840
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,261
What happened

841
00:40:48,741 --> 00:40:49,660
To take Huang Deming away.

842
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,140
His parents and some relatives.

843
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:53,741
His parents

844
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,140
You don't have to wear a hood.

845
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,100
Hello, I'm Huang Deming's father.

846
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:16,660
I have no money.

847
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,341
We have an appointment.

848
00:41:17,421 --> 00:41:17,660
Brother

849
00:41:18,781 --> 00:41:19,261
I was wrong.

850
00:41:19,261 --> 00:41:20,060
Go inside.

851
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,941
I really have no money.

852
00:41:21,341 --> 00:41:21,901
I have no money.

853
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,821
I really have no money.

854
00:41:23,821 --> 00:41:24,140
Brother

855
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,381
I have no money, brother.

856
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:29,941
It's my fault.

857
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,140
daddy

858
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:34,901
Aunt

859
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,660
Uncle and uncle.

860
00:41:37,421 --> 00:41:38,381
What are you doing?

861
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,901
Untie me.

862
00:41:39,901 --> 00:41:40,901
Go inside and solve it.

863
00:41:40,901 --> 00:41:41,540
go

864
00:41:41,741 --> 00:41:42,660
I'm not going in.

865
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,341
Where is this?

866
00:41:43,861 --> 00:41:45,341
It's like a mental hospital. I'm not going in.

867
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:45,941
mom

868
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,540
mom

869
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,660
Hurry and untie me.

870
00:41:47,861 --> 00:41:48,341
Al-Amin

871
00:41:48,781 --> 00:41:49,941
We didn't want to.

872
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,821
You always want to play games online.

873
00:41:51,821 --> 00:41:53,381
You don't care about your family.

874
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,580
Your grandfather is dying.

875
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,781
You didn't come to have a look.

876
00:41:57,781 --> 00:41:58,461
I can't.

877
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,461
When did this happen?

878
