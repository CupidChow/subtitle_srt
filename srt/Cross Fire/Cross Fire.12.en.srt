1
00:02:33,203 --> 00:02:34,163
I'm here to apologize.

2
00:02:35,643 --> 00:02:37,483
I thought you were robbing people in the daytime.

3
00:02:40,803 --> 00:02:41,643
I'm sorry.

4
00:02:41,882 --> 00:02:43,602
I shouldn't have said you're

5
00:02:43,602 --> 00:02:44,683
A cripple in a wheelchair.

6
00:02:46,002 --> 00:02:46,763
You're right.

7
00:02:47,523 --> 00:02:48,322
This is the truth.

8
00:02:51,443 --> 00:02:52,763
Aren't you angry because of this?

9
00:02:53,242 --> 00:02:54,282
Who said I was angry?

10
00:02:55,282 --> 00:02:55,922
eldest brother

11
00:02:56,322 --> 00:02:58,322
You're angry.

12
00:03:01,922 --> 00:03:02,882
That day,

13
00:03:03,602 --> 00:03:04,922
You must have heard me.

14
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:08,882
What did you say?

15
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,043
I said I would never like

16
00:03:17,483 --> 00:03:17,843
Alright

17
00:03:17,843 --> 00:03:18,562
I forgive you.

18
00:03:21,123 --> 00:03:22,522
But to be clear,

19
00:03:23,043 --> 00:03:24,603
I didn't plan to let you like it.

20
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:28,683
This classmate,

21
00:03:28,683 --> 00:03:30,282
Can you say something at once?

22
00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:33,963
Thank you.

23
00:03:38,082 --> 00:03:39,802
First, apology, then thanks.

24
00:03:40,522 --> 00:03:42,162
The sun is rising in the west today.

25
00:03:42,562 --> 00:03:43,562
I'm serious.

26
00:03:43,763 --> 00:03:44,683
What about you?

27
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,362
Helped me a lot in my study.

28
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:47,562
And yesterday at the director's place,

29
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:51,562
My previous school

30
00:03:52,043 --> 00:03:53,002
No one helped me.

31
00:03:55,243 --> 00:03:56,642
You used to love fighting.

32
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:57,922
Who dares to help you?

33
00:03:59,562 --> 00:04:00,562
I'm the only one who's bold.

34
00:04:15,123 --> 00:04:15,963
It's for you.

35
00:04:15,963 --> 00:04:16,922
When you recover,

36
00:04:20,562 --> 00:04:21,802
I appreciate your kindness.

37
00:04:22,603 --> 00:04:23,522
But I can't use this.

38
00:04:25,163 --> 00:04:26,003
It's from me.

39
00:04:30,883 --> 00:04:31,242
Alright

40
00:04:31,242 --> 00:04:32,043
I'll take it.

41
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:33,362
this time

42
00:04:33,603 --> 00:04:34,922
We won't owe each other.

43
00:04:36,003 --> 00:04:37,362
Now your grades are up.

44
00:04:37,642 --> 00:04:38,723
The seat has been changed.

45
00:04:39,122 --> 00:04:41,362
We won't have to torture each other.

46
00:04:42,962 --> 00:04:45,082
From now on, you run your circle.

47
00:04:45,082 --> 00:04:46,203
I'll follow my path.

48
00:04:46,883 --> 00:04:47,522
Bye

49
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,283
Go back to training.

50
00:05:00,003 --> 00:05:00,883
Stop following me.

51
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:01,883
Go back.

52
00:05:05,242 --> 00:05:06,122
Why are you following me?

53
00:05:06,122 --> 00:05:07,122
Go back.

54
00:05:07,122 --> 00:05:07,922
Go back.

55
00:05:10,802 --> 00:05:12,043
You really don't want to stand up?

56
00:05:15,323 --> 00:05:16,642
I've been thinking a lot.

57
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,483
I want the world to be peaceful and the air to be good.

58
00:05:20,642 --> 00:05:21,642
But these things

59
00:05:23,522 --> 00:05:25,003
Is not what I want to achieve.

60
00:05:27,402 --> 00:05:28,203
You're a captain.

61
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,203
You can't face your own problems.

62
00:05:31,483 --> 00:05:32,922
How to help the players solve the problem.

63
00:05:33,723 --> 00:05:36,003
The soldiers are soft and soft.

64
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:37,603
Without the leader,

65
00:05:37,842 --> 00:05:39,203
Your team will never go far.

66
00:05:48,763 --> 00:05:50,043
This meat is not free.

67
00:05:51,603 --> 00:05:52,522
Today,

68
00:05:52,522 --> 00:05:53,402
To ask you for advice.

69
00:05:54,203 --> 00:05:55,842
My team has been having problems.

70
00:05:56,163 --> 00:05:57,922
It's like a mess.

71
00:05:57,922 --> 00:05:59,203
You can't make it into a ball.

72
00:06:00,802 --> 00:06:01,723
Before,

73
00:06:01,723 --> 00:06:03,323
You've always been on the sports team.

74
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,082
I'm more experienced than you.

75
00:06:05,603 --> 00:06:07,402
So give me a move.

76
00:06:09,323 --> 00:06:10,723
I have little experience in this area.

77
00:06:11,082 --> 00:06:12,242
I practiced on my own.

78
00:06:12,842 --> 00:06:13,842
But I know.

79
00:06:14,003 --> 00:06:15,122
All the problems

80
00:06:15,122 --> 00:06:16,043
You can't escape.

81
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:18,682
Whether it's someone's or your own,

82
00:06:28,003 --> 00:06:29,642
How long have you had this leg?

83
00:06:29,642 --> 00:06:30,722
Eleven years ago.

84
00:06:30,722 --> 00:06:31,962
Eleven years.

85
00:06:31,962 --> 00:06:32,602
You haven't done it?

86
00:06:32,602 --> 00:06:33,803
The rehab and everything?

87
00:06:33,962 --> 00:06:35,123
I saw a lot of people

88
00:06:35,123 --> 00:06:36,642
You stood up after training.

89
00:06:37,042 --> 00:06:37,722
I've done it.

90
00:06:39,323 --> 00:06:40,123
But they all failed.

91
00:06:41,923 --> 00:06:42,803
So I gave up.

92
00:06:46,203 --> 00:06:46,923
I can help you.

93
00:06:49,563 --> 00:06:50,803
Aren't you already helping me?

94
00:06:52,962 --> 00:06:54,763
I need you to cooperate with me wholeheartedly.

95
00:06:55,203 --> 00:06:55,883
maybe

96
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:57,042
You can stand up after seeing a ghost?

97
00:06:57,883 --> 00:06:58,883
But first,

98
00:06:58,883 --> 00:06:59,923
My training style?

99
00:06:59,923 --> 00:07:00,763
More ruthless.

100
00:07:00,763 --> 00:07:01,722
But more effective.

101
00:07:01,883 --> 00:07:02,803
It will hurt more.

102
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,003
It hurts a lot now.

103
00:07:05,602 --> 00:07:06,123
I'm scared.

104
00:07:06,602 --> 00:07:07,443
I'll be scared.

105
00:07:08,363 --> 00:07:09,203
I'm eight feet tall.

106
00:07:12,323 --> 00:07:13,123
Forget it.

107
00:07:13,323 --> 00:07:14,363
I heard that

108
00:07:14,363 --> 00:07:15,842
You used to fight at your previous school.

109
00:07:15,842 --> 00:07:17,763
And picked the boys from sports teams.

110
00:07:18,282 --> 00:07:18,683
Really?

111
00:07:20,082 --> 00:07:20,683
They should fight.

112
00:07:22,722 --> 00:07:23,722
When you were fighting,

113
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:25,482
Aren't you afraid?

114
00:07:27,563 --> 00:07:28,842
They just want you to be afraid.

115
00:07:28,842 --> 00:07:30,803
But the more scared I am, the more I have to fight back.

116
00:07:31,282 --> 00:07:32,602
They will never bully you again.

117
00:07:35,482 --> 00:07:37,082
Don't make excuses if you can't do it.

118
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,042
Every time I compete,

119
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:38,642
The back leg of the whole team.

120
00:07:38,642 --> 00:07:39,883
I've let you drag it all by yourself.

121
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:40,763
big shot

122
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:42,363
I'm not an immortal.

123
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:43,402
I can't be responsive.

124
00:07:43,842 --> 00:07:45,443
You have your own mistakes.

125
00:07:45,443 --> 00:07:46,923
Can you stop fighting?

126
00:07:47,282 --> 00:07:49,123
Can we fight all the time?

127
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,282
How about this?

128
00:07:50,642 --> 00:07:52,443
You two are typing each other.

129
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:54,042
You can practice your speed.

130
00:07:54,042 --> 00:07:55,003
Xiao Bei, you're the captain.

131
00:07:55,203 --> 00:07:56,042
Take care of her.

132
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,123
I'm so bored.

133
00:07:57,123 --> 00:07:58,203
I counted it.

134
00:07:58,482 --> 00:08:00,443
I don't care if you argue three times a day.

135
00:08:00,443 --> 00:08:02,482
I don't care if you argue five times a day.

136
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,602
Don't you hate me for dragging your feet?

137
00:08:03,602 --> 00:08:04,722
How good are you?

138
00:08:04,722 --> 00:08:05,803
If you hadn't missed something on the A path,

139
00:08:05,803 --> 00:08:06,482
We will be exposed

140
00:08:06,482 --> 00:08:07,722
Are you chasing after me?

141
00:08:07,803 --> 00:08:09,323
Throw it up.

142
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:10,482
You're still sitting here with someone who has nothing to do.

143
00:08:10,482 --> 00:08:12,042
He ruined our whole team today.

144
00:08:12,522 --> 00:08:12,923
ChengHao

145
00:08:13,363 --> 00:08:14,323
Stop making excuses.

146
00:08:14,522 --> 00:08:15,602
I'm too lazy to talk about you.

147
00:08:15,602 --> 00:08:17,123
This game has made you

148
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:18,563
What's the difference between it and a piece of shit?

149
00:08:19,443 --> 00:08:20,203
Just one more round.

150
00:08:22,243 --> 00:08:22,883
Nezha, protection deity

151
00:08:22,883 --> 00:08:24,443
How did you get shot in the head today?

152
00:08:24,443 --> 00:08:25,243
I was about to hang up.

153
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:26,323
They didn't come to fill my seat.

154
00:08:26,323 --> 00:08:26,923
To cover you.

155
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:27,522
right or wrong?

156
00:08:30,522 --> 00:08:30,962
Yes

157
00:08:30,962 --> 00:08:32,243
What are you right about?

158
00:08:32,243 --> 00:08:33,082
You're always playing games.

159
00:08:33,082 --> 00:08:33,883
I was bored there.

160
00:08:33,883 --> 00:08:34,803
Who knows where you are?

161
00:08:35,042 --> 00:08:35,883
I said,

162
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:36,962
Two great gods.

163
00:08:37,203 --> 00:08:38,763
You played so well.

164
00:08:38,763 --> 00:08:39,923
Then why did you take the most difficult point?

165
00:08:39,923 --> 00:08:40,842
To us.

166
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:44,883
Why are you looking at me?

167
00:08:44,883 --> 00:08:45,842
I didn't miss anything.

168
00:08:46,282 --> 00:08:47,203
But you're laughing.

169
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:53,243
I found that you are always arguing.

170
00:08:53,243 --> 00:08:54,962
The level of fighting is increasing.

171
00:08:55,883 --> 00:08:56,883
At first,

172
00:08:56,883 --> 00:08:58,282
Is fighting alone.

173
00:08:58,563 --> 00:09:00,443
Now we're starting to argue.

174
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:01,883
I have an idea.

175
00:09:02,443 --> 00:09:04,282
We're going to fight the Strider next week.

176
00:09:05,243 --> 00:09:06,482
We can't be like before.

177
00:09:06,482 --> 00:09:07,482
It's all about shooting.

178
00:09:07,803 --> 00:09:09,363
To play tactics and cooperate,

179
00:09:09,923 --> 00:09:11,243
So from now on,

180
00:09:11,563 --> 00:09:13,842
Let's start to practice pairing.

181
00:09:14,243 --> 00:09:15,602
What is coordination training?

182
00:09:15,602 --> 00:09:16,602
S+1

183
00:09:17,042 --> 00:09:18,003
Your tactical awareness is very good.

184
00:09:18,482 --> 00:09:20,482
But his attack power is weak.

185
00:09:20,763 --> 00:09:22,123
Let Wang Kai be your gun.

186
00:09:22,323 --> 00:09:23,203
You two work together.

187
00:09:23,923 --> 00:09:24,482
Nezha, protection deity

188
00:09:24,923 --> 00:09:26,042
You have great attacking firepower.

189
00:09:26,042 --> 00:09:26,923
The rhythm is fast.

190
00:09:26,923 --> 00:09:28,323
But I'm always taken in by others.

191
00:09:28,323 --> 00:09:29,363
So from now on,

192
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,243
Cheng Hao is working with you. He's watching your ass.

193
00:09:31,803 --> 00:09:33,363
I won't be his bodyguard.

194
00:09:33,363 --> 00:09:34,162
Why should I?

195
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,563
I'm not changing with him.

196
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,803
In two days, we will fight in groups.

197
00:09:38,123 --> 00:09:38,842
The winner.

198
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,003
There's a reward.

199
00:09:40,003 --> 00:09:41,003
What's your reward?

200
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:41,923
basin

201
00:09:43,003 --> 00:09:43,482
Towels

202
00:09:43,763 --> 00:09:44,323
Or a toothbrush?

203
00:09:44,763 --> 00:09:45,243
The winner.

204
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,003
One for each.

205
00:09:47,522 --> 00:09:48,123
AK Nothingness.

206
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:50,602
Really?

207
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:51,602
Let's practice.

208
00:09:52,363 --> 00:09:54,003
Okay. With your words,

209
00:09:54,003 --> 00:09:54,642
WangKai

210
00:09:54,642 --> 00:09:55,402
Get on board.

211
00:09:55,402 --> 00:09:56,003
Zha.

212
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:56,722
I'll watch your ass.

213
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:57,402
I'll be your bodyguard.

214
00:09:57,402 --> 00:09:58,042
come

215
00:09:58,042 --> 00:09:59,042
For AK, hurry up.

216
00:10:02,443 --> 00:10:03,363
This life

217
00:10:03,363 --> 00:10:04,482
It's like playing games.

218
00:10:04,482 --> 00:10:05,443
Shoot me.

219
00:10:06,363 --> 00:10:07,363
I'll shoot you back.

220
00:10:08,323 --> 00:10:08,883
today

221
00:10:09,203 --> 00:10:09,923
Who is it?

222
00:10:10,763 --> 00:10:11,482
I

223
00:10:11,803 --> 00:10:12,923
What are you doing? I'm live.

224
00:10:13,763 --> 00:10:14,243
Stop it.

225
00:10:14,243 --> 00:10:15,203
To show you

226
00:10:15,203 --> 00:10:16,482
There's only one left.

227
00:10:16,602 --> 00:10:17,883
It's none of your business.

228
00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:19,722
Only one fan is also my fan.

229
00:10:20,962 --> 00:10:22,042
That person is me.

230
00:10:39,003 --> 00:10:39,803
Why?

231
00:10:40,923 --> 00:10:43,123
I planned to give you a live reward.

232
00:10:43,123 --> 00:10:43,883
Later,

233
00:10:43,883 --> 00:10:45,123
I'd better make a bowl of porridge and bring it to you.

234
00:10:45,403 --> 00:10:47,082
When did you learn to behave?

235
00:10:49,602 --> 00:10:51,002
The porridge is newly made.

236
00:10:51,722 --> 00:10:52,762
You can eat it after you blow.

237
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:56,803
I thought we were a team.

238
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,602
Contact each other.

239
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,443
I don't like porridge.

240
00:11:04,923 --> 00:11:06,082
Eat more.

241
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,203
You look thinner.

242
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:10,563
Stop it.

243
00:11:11,722 --> 00:11:12,962
I'm eating to give you face.

244
00:11:21,403 --> 00:11:23,323
I didn't expect you have such a skill.

245
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:28,043
It's amazing.

246
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:30,962
I learned it from my grandmother.

247
00:11:32,842 --> 00:11:34,203
My grandma is really good at cooking.

248
00:11:37,842 --> 00:11:40,082
I didn't expect the person who cooked porridge for me in the middle of the night.

249
00:11:40,082 --> 00:11:40,842
It's you.

250
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:50,803
Where are your parents?

251
00:11:50,803 --> 00:11:51,563
Not in Ningjiang?

252
00:11:52,762 --> 00:11:53,523
They're in Vietnam.

253
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,523
Why didn't you go abroad with me?

254
00:11:58,043 --> 00:11:58,882
I don't like it.

255
00:11:59,882 --> 00:12:00,762
What a coincidence!

256
00:12:02,323 --> 00:12:03,242
I don't like foreign countries.

257
00:12:10,403 --> 00:12:11,842
You haven't turned off the live stream.

258
00:12:11,962 --> 00:12:12,842
What's wrong?

259
00:12:13,163 --> 00:12:14,722
It's always just you.

260
00:12:15,043 --> 00:12:16,283
More than 50 people.

261
00:12:20,962 --> 00:12:22,043
Really

262
00:12:22,523 --> 00:12:24,242
It seems that they all like your porridge.

263
00:12:24,523 --> 00:12:25,443
I'll give you another bowl.

264
00:12:25,443 --> 00:12:26,163
No need

265
00:12:26,403 --> 00:12:27,563
Bring me the pan.

266
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:28,803
Alright.

267
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:30,803
WangKai

268
00:12:30,803 --> 00:12:32,043
Can you do anything else?

269
00:12:32,163 --> 00:12:33,082
What do you want to eat?

270
00:12:33,082 --> 00:12:34,043
I can do it.

271
00:12:34,762 --> 00:12:35,523
Old Ironmen,

272
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:37,602
Life is a comedy.

273
00:12:37,602 --> 00:12:38,842
It's a tragedy from a distance.

274
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:39,962
Sorry, who?

275
00:12:39,962 --> 00:12:41,842
You can't be sorry to yourself.

276
00:12:46,283 --> 00:12:46,962
Susu

277
00:12:48,163 --> 00:12:48,762
Wait

278
00:12:52,643 --> 00:12:53,203
Old Ironmen,

279
00:12:53,443 --> 00:12:54,842
Who gave me more gifts?

280
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:56,242
I'll drop this shrimp in a second.

281
00:12:57,722 --> 00:12:59,602
Thank you for the gift from Sixth Brother.

282
00:12:59,602 --> 00:13:01,443
I can eat a shrimp in three seconds.

283
00:13:04,762 --> 00:13:05,242
WangKai

284
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,362
The rest of it, hurry up.

285
00:13:06,602 --> 00:13:07,643
We have to cooperate.

286
00:13:07,962 --> 00:13:08,323
good

287
00:13:12,643 --> 00:13:13,683
Thank you for the new baby.

288
00:13:14,323 --> 00:13:14,923
can

289
00:13:14,923 --> 00:13:15,962
There's no problem.

290
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,362
As long as you get the gifts,

291
00:13:17,722 --> 00:13:19,643
You can have enough shrimp today.

292
00:13:21,722 --> 00:13:23,523
Didn't I say dozens of fans are enough?

293
00:13:23,523 --> 00:13:24,722
Why are there hundreds of them?

294
00:13:25,563 --> 00:13:26,323
what

295
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,762
It's not yours.

296
00:13:28,403 --> 00:13:29,203
You know what?

297
00:13:29,203 --> 00:13:30,803
Su Jiayi is so excited now.

298
00:13:31,163 --> 00:13:32,643
Hurry up and send me some more recipes.

299
00:13:33,443 --> 00:13:34,122
Alright.

300
00:13:37,043 --> 00:13:37,762
WangKai

301
00:13:39,523 --> 00:13:41,002
Our gas bill

302
00:13:41,002 --> 00:13:42,602
Are you going to recalculate?

303
00:13:50,962 --> 00:13:52,122
Why is Cheng Hao not here?

304
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,362
He usually comes first.

305
00:13:53,962 --> 00:13:55,403
Nezha always pinches it.

306
00:13:55,403 --> 00:13:56,882
Cheng Hao is probably with him.

307
00:13:56,882 --> 00:13:58,283
Cheng Hao Niu has blown out.

308
00:13:58,643 --> 00:14:00,602
Said give us a big move today.

309
00:14:18,523 --> 00:14:19,203
Yes?

310
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:20,643
Are you acting like twins today?

311
00:14:35,722 --> 00:14:36,163
hit

312
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:54,762
Since 2003,

313
00:14:55,283 --> 00:14:57,882
Our industry has been developing rapidly.

314
00:14:58,403 --> 00:15:00,362
According to the available data,

315
00:15:00,762 --> 00:15:03,043
Its market development potential is infinite.

316
00:15:06,283 --> 00:15:07,403
To you,

317
00:15:07,403 --> 00:15:10,043
This will be an unlimited revenue stream.

318
00:15:11,283 --> 00:15:12,283
And you

319
00:15:12,283 --> 00:15:14,163
Will become an industry.

320
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,962
The biggest sponsor.

321
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:24,403
So the crossfire game

322
00:15:24,403 --> 00:15:26,082
It has accumulated users since its launch.

323
00:15:26,082 --> 00:15:27,722
Has exceeded tens of millions of people.

324
00:15:27,722 --> 00:15:29,762
And the number is still going up.

325
00:15:29,882 --> 00:15:30,563
Little girl,

326
00:15:31,043 --> 00:15:33,163
You must be a college graduate.

327
00:15:33,163 --> 00:15:34,722
It's not good to do something serious.

328
00:15:34,962 --> 00:15:36,323
He insisted on doing such evil tricks.

329
00:15:39,082 --> 00:15:40,643
You're obsessed with online games.

330
00:15:40,643 --> 00:15:41,722
It's a disease.

331
00:15:41,722 --> 00:15:42,482
What about me?

332
00:15:42,482 --> 00:15:43,803
Knows about an Internet addiction center.

333
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:46,283
Take my card and go there.

334
00:15:46,923 --> 00:15:47,722
The treatment fee?

335
00:15:48,122 --> 00:15:49,163
I can give you a discount.

336
00:15:49,163 --> 00:15:50,163
to give a discount

337
00:17:38,002 --> 00:17:38,443
to wait a moment

338
00:17:39,043 --> 00:17:39,523
Wait

339
00:17:42,163 --> 00:17:42,842
Hello, President Sun.

340
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:44,002
I called you.

341
00:17:44,002 --> 00:17:45,923
To interview you about sponsoring the team.

342
00:17:46,443 --> 00:17:47,762
I have an important meeting.

343
00:17:47,842 --> 00:17:49,163
I won't keep you long.

344
00:17:50,923 --> 00:17:51,602
good

345
00:17:51,923 --> 00:17:52,923
You have three minutes.

346
00:17:54,043 --> 00:17:55,203
I remember someone said

347
00:17:55,643 --> 00:17:57,882
As long as a person's IQ reaches the basic standard,

348
00:17:57,882 --> 00:17:58,923
Stick to one thing.

349
00:17:58,923 --> 00:18:00,043
If you work ten thousand hours,

350
00:18:00,043 --> 00:18:01,962
He will definitely become a winner in this field.

351
00:18:02,443 --> 00:18:03,362
But they

352
00:18:03,523 --> 00:18:04,563
The effort is no less than others.

353
00:18:04,563 --> 00:18:06,323
Their intelligence is not lower than others.

354
00:18:06,323 --> 00:18:07,643
But they are still a group of people.

355
00:18:07,643 --> 00:18:08,643
A loser.

356
00:18:08,643 --> 00:18:09,882
Because what they are facing

357
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:11,602
Not only time but also intelligence.

358
00:18:11,602 --> 00:18:13,203
And the outside world's rejection of them.

359
00:18:13,683 --> 00:18:15,203
But they are still holding on.

360
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,043
And I know they want to win.

361
00:18:17,043 --> 00:18:18,403
Not to win the championship.

362
00:18:18,962 --> 00:18:20,043
But to change.

363
00:18:20,043 --> 00:18:21,602
What others think of this profession.

364
00:18:23,443 --> 00:18:24,523
Have you seen my interview?

365
00:18:26,203 --> 00:18:27,043
Tell me,

366
00:18:27,403 --> 00:18:29,323
Who are not easily changed by the world.

367
00:18:29,323 --> 00:18:30,762
To change the world.

368
00:18:31,203 --> 00:18:32,283
Do you know what it is?

369
00:18:32,283 --> 00:18:33,403
Let me take a small workshop

370
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,722
Into a public company?

371
00:18:36,362 --> 00:18:38,203
Because I abandoned my previous idea.

372
00:18:38,722 --> 00:18:39,962
To change people's idea.

373
00:18:40,163 --> 00:18:41,163
not to have any meaning

374
00:18:41,443 --> 00:18:43,043
You need to reach an agreement with more people.

375
00:18:43,043 --> 00:18:44,403
To make more money.

376
00:18:44,842 --> 00:18:46,643
So I advise you to give up early.

377
00:18:46,842 --> 00:18:47,523
No

378
00:18:47,523 --> 00:18:48,203
Also

379
00:18:48,203 --> 00:18:49,722
I hate video games.

380
00:18:50,043 --> 00:18:50,523
Do you want to

381
00:18:50,523 --> 00:18:51,602
It's raining. Take it.

382
00:18:53,163 --> 00:18:55,163
Mr. Sun, please give us another chance.

383
00:18:55,163 --> 00:18:55,443
Let's go.

384
00:18:55,443 --> 00:18:56,163
Give us another chance.

385
00:18:56,163 --> 00:18:57,403
Think about it, President Sun.

386
00:18:58,283 --> 00:18:58,962
President Sun.

387
00:19:14,523 --> 00:19:14,962
Brother

388
00:19:15,602 --> 00:19:16,643
Can we change two machines?

389
00:19:16,962 --> 00:19:17,683
Why should I?

390
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,203
You haven't warmed your ass yet.

391
00:19:19,203 --> 00:19:20,923
The team wants a seat.

392
00:19:20,923 --> 00:19:22,603
You have to come first.

393
00:19:22,603 --> 00:19:23,802
If you want to sit here,

394
00:19:23,802 --> 00:19:24,722
When we're done,

395
00:19:24,722 --> 00:19:25,522
Brother

396
00:19:25,923 --> 00:19:27,123
Do you know who we are?

397
00:19:27,522 --> 00:19:28,883
What are you pretending to be?

398
00:19:28,883 --> 00:19:30,603
If something happened to Team Sky,

399
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:32,042
It's not certain who will be the winner.

400
00:19:32,203 --> 00:19:33,403
In the double battle,

401
00:19:33,403 --> 00:19:34,883
It's like cheating.

402
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:35,962
What nonsense?

403
00:19:36,522 --> 00:19:37,883
What's wrong with you?

404
00:19:37,883 --> 00:19:38,603
Say it again.

405
00:19:38,603 --> 00:19:39,843
I said you cheated. What happened?

406
00:19:41,363 --> 00:19:41,762
Don't touch me.

407
00:19:43,002 --> 00:19:44,083
Stop fighting.

408
00:19:52,282 --> 00:19:53,083
Stop fighting.

409
00:19:53,923 --> 00:19:55,403
Stop fighting.

410
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:55,923
Lieutenant

411
00:19:55,923 --> 00:19:57,762
Stop fighting.

412
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:58,883
Don't hit me.

413
00:19:59,923 --> 00:20:01,403
Stop fighting.

414
00:20:02,282 --> 00:20:02,923
Stop fighting.

415
00:20:05,363 --> 00:20:07,242
Don't hit me. I'm calling the police.

416
00:20:07,242 --> 00:20:08,322
Stop fighting.

417
00:20:09,203 --> 00:20:10,123
Stop fighting.

418
00:20:16,002 --> 00:20:16,802
Stop fighting.

419
00:20:20,282 --> 00:20:21,883
Don't fight anymore.

420
00:20:22,962 --> 00:20:24,083
Stop fighting.

421
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:25,962
Stop fighting.

422
00:20:26,363 --> 00:20:27,603
Stop fighting.

423
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:28,403
Xiao Feng.

424
00:20:28,403 --> 00:20:29,403
Stop fighting.

425
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,403
Xiao Feng.

426
00:20:30,643 --> 00:20:31,123
Xiao Feng.

427
00:20:32,762 --> 00:20:33,843
It's you again.

428
00:20:37,123 --> 00:20:37,962
The Engineering College.

429
00:20:38,443 --> 00:20:39,002
Why are you

430
00:20:39,002 --> 00:20:40,203
Who play games together.

431
00:20:41,923 --> 00:20:42,603
Presentation

432
00:20:43,322 --> 00:20:45,322
We fought. It has nothing to do with her.

433
00:20:45,403 --> 00:20:47,163
She's just passing by. Let her go.

434
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,522
Did I ask you?

435
00:20:52,843 --> 00:20:53,762
Behave yourself.

436
00:20:56,443 --> 00:20:57,242
Nothing

437
00:20:57,722 --> 00:20:58,923
He's trying to scare us.

438
00:20:59,163 --> 00:21:00,123
He used to be like that.

439
00:21:01,002 --> 00:21:01,643
Nothing

440
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:02,443
Yes

441
00:21:02,643 --> 00:21:03,203
AnLuan

442
00:21:03,203 --> 00:21:04,443
This is your first time to come in.

443
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:05,242
Nothing

444
00:21:05,242 --> 00:21:06,203
You'll be familiar with it twice.

445
00:21:06,203 --> 00:21:07,002
What's going on?

446
00:21:07,002 --> 00:21:08,203
Is that glorious?

447
00:21:10,522 --> 00:21:11,403
It's fine.

448
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:12,042
Don't worry.

449
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:13,403
This time, they started to provoke.

450
00:21:13,403 --> 00:21:15,002
Is it a big deal to kill people?

451
00:21:15,242 --> 00:21:17,002
Only fighting can solve the problem?

452
00:21:17,322 --> 00:21:18,522
Didn't I do it to save you?

453
00:21:18,522 --> 00:21:19,802
No, there's something you can't talk about.

454
00:21:19,802 --> 00:21:20,282
You have to do it.

455
00:21:20,282 --> 00:21:21,123
An Lan, come out.

456
00:21:21,123 --> 00:21:22,643
The school security department is here to pick you up.

457
00:21:33,843 --> 00:21:34,482
Don't mention it to them.

458
00:21:34,482 --> 00:21:35,322
Don't talk to me.

459
00:21:35,322 --> 00:21:35,843
Just tell me.

460
00:21:35,843 --> 00:21:36,843
Don't talk to me.

461
00:21:41,123 --> 00:21:41,843
Let's go.

462
00:21:45,962 --> 00:21:46,482
hello

463
00:21:46,482 --> 00:21:47,163
Who are you looking for?

464
00:21:47,482 --> 00:21:48,843
I'm Xiao Feng's father.

465
00:21:50,923 --> 00:21:52,083
What did Xiao Feng do?

466
00:21:52,403 --> 00:21:53,843
I was caught fighting.

467
00:22:09,282 --> 00:22:10,002
dad

468
00:22:14,363 --> 00:22:15,282
It's all a misunderstanding.

469
00:22:15,282 --> 00:22:16,242
Who asked you to resign?

470
00:22:17,722 --> 00:22:18,603
If I don't come today,

471
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,042
How long are you going to hide it?

472
00:22:21,282 --> 00:22:22,643
I meant to tell you.

473
00:22:22,802 --> 00:22:24,603
We are the champion of Ning Jiang Team.

474
00:22:24,603 --> 00:22:26,363
I'm about to play the National Challenge.

475
00:22:26,363 --> 00:22:27,883
What a dare!

476
00:22:27,883 --> 00:22:29,403
You're young and you don't need to work.

477
00:22:29,403 --> 00:22:30,962
One day, I was obsessed.

478
00:22:31,522 --> 00:22:32,203
Police officer.

479
00:22:32,363 --> 00:22:33,242
You should lock him up.

480
00:22:33,242 --> 00:22:34,522
Lock him up.

481
00:22:34,883 --> 00:22:35,962
The longer the better.

482
00:22:35,962 --> 00:22:37,443
You'd better stay inside.

483
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:38,802
Just stay here.

484
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:44,443
How old is your father?

485
00:22:44,443 --> 00:22:45,163
I haven't eaten anything.

486
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:46,522
From my hometown.

487
00:22:46,522 --> 00:22:47,482
Handle your business.

488
00:22:47,962 --> 00:22:49,002
Can you be more careful?

489
00:22:58,163 --> 00:22:58,843
Yesterday,

490
00:22:58,843 --> 00:23:00,603
Give me the file of the man we arrested.

491
00:23:14,363 --> 00:23:16,123
dad

492
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:18,883
sorry

493
00:23:19,843 --> 00:23:20,843
Wait a second.

494
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,403
I won the national championship.

495
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:24,443
It's useless to win the championship.

496
00:23:24,522 --> 00:23:25,722
You can make a living.

497
00:23:25,722 --> 00:23:27,403
Can still find a reliable job.

498
00:23:27,403 --> 00:23:29,443
Video games hurt people like drugs.

499
00:23:29,443 --> 00:23:30,482
you

500
00:23:30,603 --> 00:23:32,042
Why can't you stop?

501
00:23:33,282 --> 00:23:34,843
You were obedient when you were little.

502
00:23:35,443 --> 00:23:36,482
And got good grades.

503
00:23:36,843 --> 00:23:38,403
I expected you to enter a university.

504
00:23:38,403 --> 00:23:39,843
And get a stable job.

505
00:23:40,562 --> 00:23:42,643
This is the situation of our family.

506
00:23:42,643 --> 00:23:44,042
We can't give you anything.

507
00:23:44,522 --> 00:23:45,802
We can't make you accept it.

508
00:23:45,802 --> 00:23:46,482
Good education.

509
00:23:48,002 --> 00:23:49,282
It's all my fault.

510
00:23:49,282 --> 00:23:49,923
Dad,

511
00:23:49,923 --> 00:23:50,923
I can't teach you well.

512
00:23:50,923 --> 00:23:52,203
dad

513
00:24:06,203 --> 00:24:07,203
Dad, this is

514
00:24:13,643 --> 00:24:14,363
dad

515
00:24:24,322 --> 00:24:25,083
dad

516
00:25:38,443 --> 00:25:39,443
Pengyu

517
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:40,802
Boss

518
00:25:40,802 --> 00:25:42,843
Isn't that Peng Yu, the leader of Langya League?

519
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:44,042
Why are they here?

520
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,163
There's no competition today.

521
00:25:47,123 --> 00:25:48,403
This is for inspection.

522
00:25:49,322 --> 00:25:50,363
hurry up

523
00:25:50,802 --> 00:25:52,482
See, it's me.

524
00:25:52,482 --> 00:25:54,643
So many fans came to watch the game.

525
00:25:55,282 --> 00:25:56,522
They're not coming for us.

526
00:25:58,203 --> 00:25:59,163
Who else can I hit?

527
00:26:05,042 --> 00:26:07,482
Gravity, go for it. Gravitational.

528
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,203
To fight for my dream.

529
00:26:12,482 --> 00:26:14,083
Come on

530
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:15,002
You must come on.

531
00:26:15,002 --> 00:26:17,163
Come on

532
00:26:18,163 --> 00:26:19,562
Gravity, come on.

533
00:26:19,562 --> 00:26:20,683
This kid is arrogant.

534
00:26:21,282 --> 00:26:21,843
Who is he?

535
00:26:21,843 --> 00:26:23,042
He's King.

536
00:26:28,363 --> 00:26:29,083
I threw it away.

537
00:26:31,643 --> 00:26:32,403
A, two.

538
00:26:34,722 --> 00:26:35,883
A, two.

539
00:26:35,883 --> 00:26:36,562
I'm coming.

540
00:26:39,123 --> 00:26:39,923
Cheng Hao, back up.

541
00:26:43,923 --> 00:26:44,603
ChengHao

542
00:26:50,482 --> 00:26:51,282
I dropped it.

543
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:52,083
Cheng Hao will fill the position.

544
00:26:54,883 --> 00:26:56,123
Cheng Hao, don't stand in the way.

545
00:27:04,883 --> 00:27:05,482
Go away

546
00:27:20,603 --> 00:27:21,443
Next.

547
00:27:21,443 --> 00:27:22,643
We need to avoid King's prying eyes.

548
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:24,322
We'll protect Nezha's firepower point against B.

549
00:27:25,363 --> 00:27:26,762
If Block B can't be captured,

550
00:27:27,002 --> 00:27:27,962
What if we can't attack it?

551
00:27:29,403 --> 00:27:30,722
If Block B is not captured,

552
00:27:31,363 --> 00:27:32,722
We will lose our defensive position.

553
00:27:32,722 --> 00:27:33,883
And become a sitting duck for King.

554
00:27:33,883 --> 00:27:34,883
Into five corpses.

555
00:27:34,883 --> 00:27:36,363
The most important point of the game.

556
00:27:37,443 --> 00:27:38,042
Next

557
00:27:39,482 --> 00:27:41,002
Crash and lose the whole game.

558
00:27:48,322 --> 00:27:49,163
Warehouse B is gone.

559
00:27:49,443 --> 00:27:50,123
Nice gun.

560
00:27:50,643 --> 00:27:52,083
Lu Xiao Bei's brain and gun

561
00:27:52,403 --> 00:27:53,203
It's fast.

562
00:27:53,683 --> 00:27:54,403
Is a threat.

563
00:27:55,683 --> 00:27:56,802
Door B, one.

564
00:27:56,802 --> 00:27:57,363
Door B has two.

565
00:28:00,403 --> 00:28:01,603
Cheng Hao, hurry up.

566
00:28:06,802 --> 00:28:07,482
Go away.

567
00:28:11,002 --> 00:28:11,722
From now on,

568
00:28:14,242 --> 00:28:15,002
I'll throw a flash.

569
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:16,722
You're flashing me.

570
00:28:20,522 --> 00:28:22,203
They played so simply.

571
00:28:22,203 --> 00:28:23,242
And didn't cooperate.

572
00:28:23,722 --> 00:28:24,722
The biggest problem

573
00:28:25,242 --> 00:28:26,322
Because of Cheng Hao.

574
00:28:27,643 --> 00:28:29,643
He will definitely lose.

575
00:28:29,643 --> 00:28:31,282
Look, he just died again.

576
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:32,722
Keep an eye on him.

577
00:28:33,203 --> 00:28:34,923
Cheng Hao, are you a pig?

578
00:28:35,282 --> 00:28:36,923
I beg you, please.

579
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,643
Can you stop fooling around?

580
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:39,242
ChengHao

581
00:28:39,242 --> 00:28:40,883
Can you play games with your brain?

582
00:28:40,883 --> 00:28:41,962
Can you still fight?

583
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:43,443
All right.

584
00:28:44,242 --> 00:28:44,883
Calm down.

585
00:28:46,322 --> 00:28:46,603
Hao

586
00:28:47,443 --> 00:28:48,123
Let go of me.

587
00:28:53,843 --> 00:28:54,562
Cheng Hao, follow me.

588
00:28:54,562 --> 00:28:55,203
good

589
00:28:57,962 --> 00:28:58,203
Cheng

590
00:29:16,722 --> 00:29:17,522
The mouse is right.

591
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:18,603
Why did you throw it?

592
00:29:18,603 --> 00:29:20,123
I want to throw you.

593
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:22,002
Can I throw you?

594
00:29:22,603 --> 00:29:23,762
It's always because of you.

595
00:29:24,443 --> 00:29:25,643
You really admire me.

596
00:29:27,203 --> 00:29:28,282
Why the fire?

597
00:29:28,282 --> 00:29:29,443
Didn't you lose your gun?

598
00:29:40,002 --> 00:29:41,443
Xiao Bei, I have a stomachache.

599
00:29:41,443 --> 00:29:42,802
I'm going to the bathroom. Wait for me.

600
00:29:46,443 --> 00:29:47,242
Xiaobei

601
00:29:48,123 --> 00:29:49,443
I'll give you two choices.

602
00:29:49,643 --> 00:29:50,203
first

603
00:29:50,203 --> 00:29:51,123
Replace me now.

604
00:29:51,722 --> 00:29:52,482
The second one?

605
00:29:53,923 --> 00:29:54,843
Replace him now.

606
00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:56,843
You know he scams you every game.

607
00:29:57,163 --> 00:29:58,562
I also know you two are close.

608
00:29:58,562 --> 00:29:59,282
But now,

609
00:29:59,282 --> 00:30:00,443
When talking about brotherhood,

610
00:30:00,962 --> 00:30:02,522
You can't keep wiping his ass, can you?

611
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:03,643
Replace him.

612
00:30:04,282 --> 00:30:05,123
Can we win?

613
00:30:05,322 --> 00:30:06,683
I only know that I won't replace him.

614
00:30:06,683 --> 00:30:07,883
We will continue to lose.

615
00:30:08,203 --> 00:30:10,042
We're going to beat Langya soon.

616
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,083
We can't lose anymore.

617
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:16,002
I heard that

618
00:30:16,002 --> 00:30:17,562
Zero has come out from the previous team.

619
00:30:18,282 --> 00:30:19,443
And I didn't find a place.

620
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:21,203
If he comes to our team now,

621
00:30:21,203 --> 00:30:23,002
We can fight for the Hundred Cities.

622
00:30:24,443 --> 00:30:25,522
Let me think about it.

623
00:30:26,722 --> 00:30:28,363
What do you have to think about?

624
00:30:28,363 --> 00:30:30,002
Replace Cheng Hao with zero degrees.

625
00:30:30,242 --> 00:30:31,802
There are only advantages and disadvantages.

626
00:30:46,123 --> 00:30:47,643
Xiao Bei, what were you talking about?

627
00:30:50,603 --> 00:30:52,722
How did you lose today?

628
00:30:52,843 --> 00:30:53,203
Yes

629
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,282
I played so bad today.

630
00:30:55,282 --> 00:30:56,562
I can't even watch it myself.

631
00:30:57,002 --> 00:30:58,163
To cause trouble to everyone.

632
00:30:58,163 --> 00:30:59,282
You know that.

633
00:30:59,762 --> 00:31:01,083
Next, I will train hard.

634
00:31:01,843 --> 00:31:02,923
You know my potential.

635
00:31:02,923 --> 00:31:04,123
The progress is absolutely amazing.

636
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:05,522
Don't worry.

637
00:31:09,843 --> 00:31:10,562
I'm leaving.

638
00:31:24,042 --> 00:31:24,722
Yes?

639
00:31:26,762 --> 00:31:28,403
There's something wrong with your team.

640
00:31:32,363 --> 00:31:34,363
To learn how to be a good captain.

641
00:31:36,322 --> 00:31:37,083
Pretty good

642
00:31:40,522 --> 00:31:42,083
Let me recommend a book for you.

643
00:31:43,923 --> 00:31:45,083
It will help you.

644
00:32:24,163 --> 00:32:24,762
AnLuan

645
00:32:26,042 --> 00:32:26,603
AnLuan

646
00:32:55,883 --> 00:32:56,722
Hello, Dean.

647
00:32:57,722 --> 00:32:58,403
AnLuan

648
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,282
I finally see you.

649
00:33:01,203 --> 00:33:02,722
Are you looking for me?

650
00:33:02,722 --> 00:33:03,883
I heard that

651
00:33:03,883 --> 00:33:05,242
You're always with a bunch of jerks.

652
00:33:05,443 --> 00:33:07,522
And went to the police station for fighting.

653
00:33:07,522 --> 00:33:08,522
They are not bastards.

654
00:33:08,522 --> 00:33:09,923
He just likes playing games.

655
00:33:09,923 --> 00:33:11,522
Don't flatter them.

656
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:13,883
If the school hadn't come forward,

657
00:33:13,883 --> 00:33:16,203
You're still locked in there with those people, you know?

658
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:17,962
sorry

659
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:19,203
Sorry to trouble you.

660
00:33:19,883 --> 00:33:20,762
AnLuan

661
00:33:21,522 --> 00:33:22,643
In this class,

662
00:33:22,883 --> 00:33:24,482
I'm most optimistic about you.

663
00:33:24,643 --> 00:33:26,203
Even if I didn't get a recommendation,

664
00:33:26,203 --> 00:33:27,923
It's not a big deal.

665
00:33:28,242 --> 00:33:29,722
You can't let yourself fall.

666
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:30,923
chairman of department

667
00:33:30,923 --> 00:33:32,562
I didn't stoop to your standards.

668
00:33:32,562 --> 00:33:33,443
Where is she?

669
00:33:33,443 --> 00:33:35,883
I've never realized my depravity.

670
00:33:36,203 --> 00:33:37,643
Just like the junkie.

671
00:33:37,843 --> 00:33:38,962
They just think

672
00:33:38,962 --> 00:33:40,163
I did what needed to be done.

673
00:33:43,242 --> 00:33:43,603
That's enough.

674
00:33:43,962 --> 00:33:44,962
Your job

675
00:33:45,322 --> 00:33:46,603
I've contacted them for you.

676
00:33:46,603 --> 00:33:48,403
For my sake,

677
00:33:48,562 --> 00:33:49,843
To give us a chance.

678
00:33:50,242 --> 00:33:51,322
The day after tomorrow,

679
00:33:51,643 --> 00:33:52,603
Take care of yourself.

680
00:34:00,522 --> 00:34:01,242
AnLuan

681
00:34:03,322 --> 00:34:04,083
Why are you going back to school?

682
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,042
Without telling me.

683
00:34:05,242 --> 00:34:05,962
I'll take it for you.

684
00:34:06,163 --> 00:34:06,802
I don't need your help.

685
00:34:08,282 --> 00:34:09,042
My treat

686
00:34:09,042 --> 00:34:10,242
The captain has ordered the dishes.

687
00:34:10,242 --> 00:34:10,762
I'm busy.

688
00:34:10,762 --> 00:34:11,562
I'm going to the department to hand in the file.

689
00:34:12,722 --> 00:34:14,002
Okay, I'll pay it with you.

690
00:34:14,282 --> 00:34:15,562
Let's eat after we hand it over.

691
00:34:15,562 --> 00:34:16,603
Go away.

692
00:34:18,643 --> 00:34:19,843
You're really angry about what happened yesterday.

693
00:34:21,322 --> 00:34:22,363
I'm not angry.

694
00:34:22,562 --> 00:34:23,123
I just think

695
00:34:23,123 --> 00:34:24,322
I might have made some mistakes.

696
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,322
You didn't make a mistake. They did.

697
00:34:26,322 --> 00:34:27,242
They attacked first.

698
00:34:27,562 --> 00:34:29,242
My fault is that I didn't read a good book.

699
00:34:29,242 --> 00:34:30,123
Whether I'm going to graduate or not,

700
00:34:30,123 --> 00:34:31,282
I have to be with you.

701
00:34:31,643 --> 00:34:32,722
To the police station.

702
00:34:32,722 --> 00:34:34,042
What's wrong with the police station?

703
00:34:34,042 --> 00:34:35,242
People's police is for people.

704
00:34:35,482 --> 00:34:36,403
Help people solve disputes.

705
00:34:36,923 --> 00:34:37,603
Shouldn't I?

706
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:39,843
Stay away from me.

707
00:34:39,843 --> 00:34:40,562
I don't want to talk to you.

708
00:34:46,762 --> 00:34:48,042
What's wrong with you?

709
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:59,083
The delivery of Su Jiayi.

710
00:34:59,203 --> 00:34:59,923
It's so big.

711
00:35:01,843 --> 00:35:02,722
It's mine.

712
00:35:04,123 --> 00:35:04,962
Sign for it.

713
00:35:08,242 --> 00:35:09,002
I'll do it.

714
00:35:09,203 --> 00:35:10,203
What did you buy?

715
00:35:10,203 --> 00:35:11,042
Don't bother.

716
00:35:11,203 --> 00:35:12,443
Be gentle. Don't break it.

717
00:35:13,883 --> 00:35:14,883
Bring it in.

718
00:35:15,923 --> 00:35:16,722
Slow down.

719
00:35:21,762 --> 00:35:22,923
Let me open it for you.

720
00:35:23,762 --> 00:35:24,203
Stay out of it.

721
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:29,242
I'm ordering takeout. What are you eating?

722
00:35:29,242 --> 00:35:30,203
casual

723
00:35:35,562 --> 00:35:36,562
What did you buy?

724
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:39,403
You shouldn't. Don't look.

725
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:40,522
You shouldn't have asked. Don't ask.

726
00:35:40,962 --> 00:35:41,562
Also

727
00:35:41,762 --> 00:35:43,762
When are you going to fix the door?

728
00:35:56,843 --> 00:35:58,522
There are so few people in the library today.

729
00:35:58,522 --> 00:36:00,242
So I came and got a seat.

730
00:36:01,322 --> 00:36:02,802
Your library is pretty.

731
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:04,482
Yeah, the new one.

732
00:36:04,722 --> 00:36:06,482
So there are few and quiet people.

733
00:36:06,482 --> 00:36:07,962
I come here to study every day.

734
00:36:10,403 --> 00:36:11,002
Correct!

735
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,002
Recently, I have reviewed

736
00:36:12,002 --> 00:36:13,883
IELTS Advanced Spoken Version

737
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:15,002
If you have time,

738
00:36:15,002 --> 00:36:16,522
You can practice your oral English with me.

739
00:36:16,522 --> 00:36:17,042
Alright.

740
00:36:18,482 --> 00:36:19,482
Are you still playing games?

741
00:36:20,443 --> 00:36:21,523
It's been a long time.

742
00:36:21,523 --> 00:36:22,442
Don't worry.

743
00:36:22,603 --> 00:36:23,043
Well

744
00:36:23,322 --> 00:36:24,282
That's right.

745
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:25,242
A serious girl.

746
00:36:25,242 --> 00:36:26,322
Who plays games all the time?

747
00:36:26,842 --> 00:36:27,882
When you pass the IELTS,

748
00:36:28,322 --> 00:36:29,802
Just come here with me.

749
00:36:30,123 --> 00:36:30,523
Well

750
00:36:31,282 --> 00:36:32,282
I will work hard.

751
00:36:32,563 --> 00:36:33,322
Trust me.

752
00:36:34,603 --> 00:36:36,882
What's that book on the left?

753
00:36:40,163 --> 00:36:42,762
The book I was sitting in the religious section

754
00:36:42,762 --> 00:36:43,882
You're not interested.

755
00:36:44,322 --> 00:36:45,362
I need to use the restroom.

756
00:36:45,362 --> 00:36:46,123
Wait for me.

757
00:37:01,483 --> 00:37:02,362
The takeout is here.

758
00:37:04,282 --> 00:37:04,963
dang!

759
00:37:05,963 --> 00:37:06,882
That's okay.

760
00:37:12,842 --> 00:37:13,523
feed

761
00:37:14,282 --> 00:37:15,083
Who are you?

762
00:37:17,842 --> 00:37:18,842
Who are you?

763
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:20,083
I asked you first.

764
00:37:20,362 --> 00:37:21,563
You have to answer first.

765
00:37:21,563 --> 00:37:23,083
Why should I answer first?

766
00:37:26,483 --> 00:37:27,242
Su Jiayi.

767
00:37:28,003 --> 00:37:28,882
Who is he?

768
00:37:32,242 --> 00:37:33,203
You're back.

769
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:34,922
Your takeout.

770
00:37:35,563 --> 00:37:36,282
hello

771
00:37:36,282 --> 00:37:37,442
Are you her boyfriend?

772
00:37:37,442 --> 00:37:38,523
This is her takeout.

773
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:40,603
I sent her upstairs.

774
00:37:40,603 --> 00:37:42,203
Because the security guard is not downstairs.

775
00:37:43,442 --> 00:37:44,802
Just bring it to the door next time.

776
00:37:44,802 --> 00:37:45,442
Thank you.

777
00:37:45,483 --> 00:37:46,043
Nothing

778
00:37:46,043 --> 00:37:46,922
Looking forward to your good comments.

779
00:37:50,563 --> 00:37:52,603
What's wrong with Su Jiayi?

780
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,402
Where are you?

781
00:37:53,722 --> 00:37:54,603
Who is this man?

782
00:37:54,603 --> 00:37:55,683
What's your relationship with him?

783
00:37:56,163 --> 00:37:56,802
Where are you?

784
00:37:56,802 --> 00:37:58,083
What's going on?

785
00:37:58,083 --> 00:37:59,322
Don't shout.

786
00:37:59,322 --> 00:37:59,963
Who are you?

787
00:37:59,963 --> 00:38:00,963
What? Who?

788
00:38:00,963 --> 00:38:01,722
WangKai

789
00:38:01,722 --> 00:38:02,483
Get out

790
00:38:02,842 --> 00:38:03,882
WangKai

791
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:04,523
Who is Wang Kai?

792
00:38:09,922 --> 00:38:10,963
Su Jiayi.

793
00:38:10,963 --> 00:38:12,003
Be honest with me.

794
00:38:12,563 --> 00:38:13,402
Where are you?

795
00:38:13,922 --> 00:38:14,922
Who is Wang Kai?

796
00:38:17,203 --> 00:38:18,523
He's my team mate.

797
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:20,922
I'm still in Ning Jiang.

798
00:38:22,163 --> 00:38:23,882
To live with my teammates.

799
00:38:24,563 --> 00:38:25,003
Jiayi

800
00:38:25,842 --> 00:38:26,563
I thought you would change.

801
00:38:28,362 --> 00:38:29,722
But you disappointed me.

802
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:33,722
I just want to do what I like.

803
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:56,762
WangKai

804
00:38:56,762 --> 00:38:58,322
Why didn't you search the back garden?

805
00:38:58,322 --> 00:38:59,963
Why do I have to clean all the buttocks?

806
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:00,802
to fart

807
00:39:00,802 --> 00:39:01,802
I've already arranged it.

808
00:39:01,882 --> 00:39:02,963
If you didn't search, you're right.

809
00:39:03,643 --> 00:39:05,083
I'll take the middle road and still take the head.

810
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:06,083
You don't have to tell me.

811
00:39:06,083 --> 00:39:07,163
If the opponent is the Langfang League,

812
00:39:07,163 --> 00:39:07,963
The game is over.

813
00:39:07,963 --> 00:39:08,643
That's right.

814
00:39:08,842 --> 00:39:09,563
How?

815
00:39:09,563 --> 00:39:10,362
It's all out of order.

816
00:39:10,603 --> 00:39:12,322
It's your turn. Get out of here.

817
00:39:12,762 --> 00:39:13,762
It's you who should get out.

818
00:39:16,762 --> 00:39:17,882
Are you done?

819
00:39:21,043 --> 00:39:21,603
That's enough.

820
00:39:22,442 --> 00:39:23,442
That's all for today.

821
00:39:25,603 --> 00:39:27,043
If you have the ability, go and fight Langya.

822
00:39:27,402 --> 00:39:28,282
Who are you to tell me?

823
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,282
Okay, I said it's over.

824
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:54,643
Introduce yourself.

825
00:39:55,362 --> 00:39:56,163
My name is Peng Yu.

826
00:39:58,083 --> 00:39:58,882
I know you.

827
00:40:00,123 --> 00:40:01,322
The captain of the Langya League.

828
00:40:02,123 --> 00:40:03,163
Before the competition,

829
00:40:03,163 --> 00:40:04,563
You're so angry.

830
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:05,802
Yes?

831
00:40:06,523 --> 00:40:08,282
Are you suddenly

832
00:40:08,402 --> 00:40:09,003
With confidence.

833
00:40:10,722 --> 00:40:12,402
I've always admired you.

834
00:40:12,603 --> 00:40:13,683
I'll watch all your competitions.

835
00:40:13,683 --> 00:40:14,762
Join the Langya Team.

836
00:40:14,842 --> 00:40:16,003
I'll make room for you.

837
00:40:16,882 --> 00:40:18,603
Before the game, dig a corner.

838
00:40:19,643 --> 00:40:20,563
What's this?

839
00:40:22,442 --> 00:40:23,563
I just think

840
00:40:23,882 --> 00:40:25,322
You shouldn't be delayed by these teams.

841
00:40:26,003 --> 00:40:27,282
How far can one go?

842
00:40:27,483 --> 00:40:28,722
Depends on who you travel with.

843
00:40:29,203 --> 00:40:30,322
As long as you come to Langya,

844
00:40:30,683 --> 00:40:32,083
The champion of Ning Jiang Team.

845
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:33,563
It must be ours.

846
00:40:41,842 --> 00:40:42,722
Lead the way.

847
00:40:59,563 --> 00:41:00,242
feed

848
00:41:00,603 --> 00:41:02,083
Why haven't you arrived yet?

849
00:41:03,203 --> 00:41:04,203
Where are we going?

850
00:41:04,203 --> 00:41:06,722
There's an exhibition match at Tianhong Shopping Mall today.

851
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,163
Xu Wei and I have arrived.

852
00:41:08,163 --> 00:41:09,402
Don't you remember?

853
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,442
Isn't it tomorrow?

854
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:12,722
It's today.

855
00:41:12,722 --> 00:41:15,043
It's Saturday on the schedule.

856
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:16,762
Wait, let me have a look.

857
00:41:28,442 --> 00:41:29,722
It's really today.

858
00:41:31,242 --> 00:41:32,242
Where is Kirin?

859
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:33,563
I called them.

860
00:41:33,842 --> 00:41:34,762
They aren't answering.

861
00:41:34,922 --> 00:41:35,963
Then keep fighting.

862
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:36,722
I can't get through again.

863
00:41:36,722 --> 00:41:37,563
You can just hit the door.

864
00:41:37,563 --> 00:41:39,322
The exhibition match will cost us 1,000 yuan.

865
00:41:39,322 --> 00:41:41,203
The cooked duck can't be left alone.

866
00:41:41,203 --> 00:41:42,043
You're flying like this?

867
00:41:42,043 --> 00:41:42,882
Hurry up.

868
00:41:43,402 --> 00:41:44,203
Received

869
00:41:49,802 --> 00:41:51,282
Everyone is waiting for you.

870
00:41:51,282 --> 00:41:52,842
Should we carry out the activity?

871
00:41:52,842 --> 00:41:53,442
Sorry

872
00:41:53,442 --> 00:41:54,802
Why don't you wait a little longer?

873
00:41:54,802 --> 00:41:55,643
Our team will be here soon.

874
00:41:56,282 --> 00:41:57,083
I'm telling you,

875
00:41:57,362 --> 00:41:58,643
We have many teams to invite.

876
00:41:59,083 --> 00:41:59,563
Please

877
00:41:59,563 --> 00:42:01,322
It's for the sake of you old players.

878
00:42:01,322 --> 00:42:02,083
That's right.

879
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:03,043
If it influences the activity,

880
00:42:03,043 --> 00:42:04,563
I won't pay any appearance fee.

881
00:42:04,963 --> 00:42:05,563
It's a hot day.

882
00:42:05,563 --> 00:42:06,643
Don't be angry.

883
00:42:06,762 --> 00:42:08,483
The Kirin is here.

884
00:42:08,483 --> 00:42:09,683
Hurry up. Hurry.

885
00:42:10,163 --> 00:42:10,603
I'm coming.

886
00:42:10,603 --> 00:42:11,523
Sorry

887
00:42:11,603 --> 00:42:12,203
I forgot about it.

888
00:42:12,203 --> 00:42:13,322
Cut the crap. Get on the machine.

889
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,362
Don't let the 1,000 yuan go to waste.

890
00:42:18,442 --> 00:42:20,123
Chang Sha, give me the keyboard and mouse.

891
00:42:20,123 --> 00:42:22,043
I don't have your keyboard and mouse.

892
00:42:22,043 --> 00:42:23,242
Didn't I ask you to bring me

893
00:42:24,003 --> 00:42:25,402
When did you ask me to bring it for you?

894
00:42:25,402 --> 00:42:27,003
Just let me bring you an Internet card.

895
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:28,922
You didn't ask me to bring you a keyboard and mouse.

896
00:42:29,722 --> 00:42:30,882
Is Ming there?

897
00:42:32,242 --> 00:42:33,643
I only brought my own.

898
00:42:35,282 --> 00:42:37,603
Can we start now?

899
00:42:38,123 --> 00:42:39,003
Sorry about that.

900
00:42:39,442 --> 00:42:40,603
You have this backup.

901
00:42:40,603 --> 00:42:41,523
The keyboard and mouse?

902
00:42:41,922 --> 00:42:43,762
Don't professional players bring their own?

903
00:42:43,762 --> 00:42:45,203
I forgot to bring it.

904
00:42:45,203 --> 00:42:45,922
No

905
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:47,802
Without you, it's not an invitation tournament.

906
00:42:47,802 --> 00:42:48,442
Shut up and sit down.

907
00:42:48,603 --> 00:42:49,362
invitation tournament

908
00:42:50,722 --> 00:42:51,523
Sorry.

909
00:42:51,523 --> 00:42:52,483
Otherwise,

910
00:42:52,643 --> 00:42:53,882
Can you wait a little longer?

911
00:42:54,123 --> 00:42:55,203
Let's get it.

912
00:42:55,762 --> 00:42:56,603
Next team.

913
00:42:57,043 --> 00:42:57,643
That's right.

914
00:43:10,402 --> 00:43:11,163
Focus.

915
00:43:24,203 --> 00:43:25,123
I'll take care of it for you.

916
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:26,802
Fight hard.

917
00:43:29,043 --> 00:43:29,722
stop

918
00:43:29,722 --> 00:43:30,563
Where are you going?

919
00:43:30,922 --> 00:43:31,762
to pee

920
00:43:31,762 --> 00:43:32,882
Hurry back.

921
00:43:33,203 --> 00:43:34,483
You have a lot of shit.

922
00:43:40,282 --> 00:43:41,203
What's Nezha doing?

923
00:43:41,483 --> 00:43:42,362
He went to the bathroom.

924
00:43:54,922 --> 00:43:55,722
dang!

925
00:44:00,963 --> 00:44:01,882
Lu Xiao Bei,

926
00:44:02,523 --> 00:44:04,563
I told you about the substitution.

927
00:44:04,563 --> 00:44:05,523
How's it going?

928
00:44:06,643 --> 00:44:07,563
Now is not the time.

929
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,163
I don't understand.

930
00:44:11,163 --> 00:44:13,322
Do you have to hesitate for so long?

931
00:44:18,563 --> 00:44:19,322
Nezha, protection deity

932
00:44:19,722 --> 00:44:20,402
What are you doing?

933
00:44:26,322 --> 00:44:27,322
Why are you running?

934
00:44:27,322 --> 00:44:28,603
Don't run back. Come back.

935
00:44:28,603 --> 00:44:29,203
When we come back,

936
00:44:29,603 --> 00:44:30,963
Where are you going?

937
00:44:36,163 --> 00:44:37,563
What are they doing?

938
00:44:39,922 --> 00:44:41,043
Did you steal the money?

939
00:44:41,043 --> 00:44:41,842
Why are you running?

940
00:44:41,842 --> 00:44:43,322
Catch the thief. Don't move.

941
00:44:44,043 --> 00:44:44,603
Make it clear.

942
00:44:45,842 --> 00:44:46,603
What are you doing?

943
00:44:48,842 --> 00:44:50,442
500 yuan is missing from my wallet today.

944
00:44:51,123 --> 00:44:51,922
Did you steal it?

945
00:44:52,402 --> 00:44:53,043
no

946
00:44:55,762 --> 00:44:56,563
What is this?

947
00:44:57,722 --> 00:44:58,643
Did you steal it?

948
00:44:58,643 --> 00:44:59,442
I didn't steal it.

949
00:44:59,442 --> 00:45:00,043
It's time to die.

950
00:45:00,043 --> 00:45:01,083
Are you stubborn?

951
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:01,643
There are cameras here.

952
00:45:01,643 --> 00:45:02,882
Believe it or not, I'll call the surveillance camera.

953
00:45:03,163 --> 00:45:04,163
I'll ask you one last time.

954
00:45:04,163 --> 00:45:05,123
Did you steal it?

955
00:45:05,362 --> 00:45:06,282
I didn't steal it.

956
00:45:08,203 --> 00:45:08,963
I took it.

957
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:10,083
Did you ask my permission?

958
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:10,563
Take my money.

959
00:45:10,563 --> 00:45:11,802
It's not stealing. What is it?

960
00:45:11,802 --> 00:45:12,563
wage

961
00:45:13,242 --> 00:45:13,802
I didn't steal it.

962
00:45:14,362 --> 00:45:15,322
Did you hear that?

963
00:45:15,483 --> 00:45:16,523
He's still making excuses.

964
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,362
Is Nezha short of money?

965
00:45:18,362 --> 00:45:19,722
Is something wrong?

966
00:45:19,802 --> 00:45:20,483
Nezha, protection deity

967
00:45:20,842 --> 00:45:22,163
Tell me if you have any difficulty.

968
00:45:24,442 --> 00:45:25,643
He stole my money.

969
00:45:25,643 --> 00:45:26,603
I'm the victim.

970
00:45:26,603 --> 00:45:28,163
You don't care about me.

971
00:45:28,163 --> 00:45:29,762
But you care about him, right?

972
00:45:29,762 --> 00:45:30,882
What's going on?

973
00:45:30,882 --> 00:45:32,083
Are you short of a few hundred yuan?

974
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:33,163
What are you talking about?

975
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:34,242
It's not exciting.

976
00:45:35,123 --> 00:45:36,362
This is theft, this is a crime.

977
00:45:36,362 --> 00:45:37,203
Do you know the law?

978
00:45:37,203 --> 00:45:38,802
I paid for Nezha.

979
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:39,722
To you on WeChat.

980
00:45:40,322 --> 00:45:41,163
big sister

981
00:45:41,163 --> 00:45:42,322
It's not about money.

982
00:45:42,603 --> 00:45:43,762
This is a matter of principle.

983
00:45:43,762 --> 00:45:45,003
It's about character.

984
00:45:45,643 --> 00:45:47,722
There's a mouse poop in our porridge.

985
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:48,963
Can you eat it?

986
00:45:50,722 --> 00:45:51,963
Then what do you want to do?

987
00:45:52,402 --> 00:45:53,563
I think this matter

988
00:45:53,563 --> 00:45:54,722
Violated the order of the team.

989
00:45:54,722 --> 00:45:55,563
You must be dismissed.

990
00:45:56,322 --> 00:45:57,203
Xiao Bei, what do you think?

991
00:45:57,203 --> 00:45:58,842
Make it clear first.

992
00:45:59,163 --> 00:46:00,242
Don't talk about firing.

993
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:01,483
Xiaobei

994
00:46:01,882 --> 00:46:02,762
What do you mean?

995
00:46:06,922 --> 00:46:07,802
a row

996
00:46:08,842 --> 00:46:09,802
I've seen it clearly.

997
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:12,402
Are you all partial to him?

998
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,643
Treat him as a treasure.

999
00:46:13,882 --> 00:46:15,203
I'm the most annoying one in this team.

1000
00:46:15,203 --> 00:46:15,603
Right?

1001
00:46:19,003 --> 00:46:19,762
I don't care.

1002
00:46:20,083 --> 00:46:21,163
I'm here today.

1003
00:46:21,722 --> 00:46:22,802
He stole my money.

1004
00:46:23,043 --> 00:46:24,362
If you don't give me an explanation,

1005
00:46:24,362 --> 00:46:25,003
Otherwise, I will...

1006
00:46:25,003 --> 00:46:26,003
Otherwise, what are you doing?

1007
00:46:26,003 --> 00:46:27,003
Or I'll call the police.

1008
00:46:29,603 --> 00:46:30,842
Cheng Hao, let me tell you something.

1009
00:46:31,322 --> 00:46:32,802
Five hundred yuan, no case.

1010
00:46:32,802 --> 00:46:33,922
How about Nezha?

1011
00:46:33,922 --> 00:46:35,322
It's our team's internal affair.

1012
00:46:35,322 --> 00:46:36,563
What do you mean by calling the police?

1013
00:46:36,563 --> 00:46:37,523
What do you mean?

1014
00:46:38,442 --> 00:46:40,203
I'm usually a little bit slow.

1015
00:46:40,523 --> 00:46:42,083
You've been pushing me around all day.

1016
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:42,643
What about him?

1017
00:46:42,643 --> 00:46:44,163
He stole the money.

1018
00:46:44,163 --> 00:46:45,322
It's the same as merit.

1019
00:46:45,322 --> 00:46:46,603
What do you think this means?

1020
00:46:46,842 --> 00:46:48,163
Do you think this is interesting?

1021
00:46:50,322 --> 00:46:51,523
I think he's right.

1022
00:46:51,802 --> 00:46:53,802
Our team should leave.

1023
00:46:54,282 --> 00:46:55,563
But the one who needs to leave...

1024
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:57,922
Is the one who is holding the team back.

1025
00:46:58,242 --> 00:46:59,203
I'm leaving, right?

1026
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,362
I'm telling you,

1027
00:47:00,563 --> 00:47:02,242
If Xiao Bei and I hadn't formed a team,

1028
00:47:02,242 --> 00:47:03,643
What's your problem?

1029
00:47:04,083 --> 00:47:06,003
You've been whispering in my ear all day long.

1030
00:47:06,003 --> 00:47:06,722
Mom,

1031
00:47:06,722 --> 00:47:08,043
I'm tired of you.

1032
00:47:08,043 --> 00:47:09,123
If you want to stay or not, go.

1033
00:47:09,123 --> 00:47:10,163
No one will stop you.

1034
00:47:10,163 --> 00:47:11,402
Don't take you and Lu Xiao Bei.

1035
00:47:11,402 --> 00:47:12,322
Bro, it's my loyalty.

1036
00:47:12,322 --> 00:47:13,083
Without you,

1037
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:14,563
Our team can have today's ranking.

1038
00:47:14,563 --> 00:47:16,322
Cheng Hao, I'm telling you, you're almost there.

1039
00:47:16,322 --> 00:47:17,203
Get out of here.

1040
00:47:17,282 --> 00:47:18,362
You love to be brave, right?

1041
00:47:18,362 --> 00:47:20,003
You're always trying to steal the limelight.

1042
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,523
How could you say that to me?

1043
00:47:21,963 --> 00:47:22,802
Say it again.

1044
00:47:22,802 --> 00:47:24,003
I've said it ten thousand times.

1045
00:47:24,083 --> 00:47:25,483
Xiao Bei and I are in the team.

1046
00:47:25,483 --> 00:47:26,643
If you want to stay or not, get out of here.

1047
00:47:28,722 --> 00:47:29,722
besides

1048
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:30,523
WangKai

1049
00:47:31,922 --> 00:47:32,722
Let go of him.

1050
00:47:34,282 --> 00:47:35,083
I don't want to call the police.

1051
00:47:38,603 --> 00:47:39,603
Such an excellent team.

1052
00:47:39,603 --> 00:47:40,922
I really don't want to stay any longer.

1053
00:47:40,922 --> 00:47:42,242
If you want to leave, leave now.

1054
00:47:46,643 --> 00:47:47,802
One counts.

1055
00:47:48,003 --> 00:47:48,683
Who is missing in this world?

1056
00:47:48,683 --> 00:47:49,963
It's the same 24 hours.

1057
00:47:49,963 --> 00:47:51,163
Of course you think it doesn't matter.

1058
00:47:51,163 --> 00:47:52,362
Anyway, you have found a new place.

1059
00:48:08,362 --> 00:48:11,123
You're silly enough to fight inside.

1060
00:48:11,643 --> 00:48:13,043
The road is small.

1061
00:48:13,282 --> 00:48:16,083
I've discussed with the Langya League.

1062
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:18,163
Get your ass out of here.

1063
00:48:18,163 --> 00:48:18,922
right or wrong?

1064
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:20,882
Xiaobei

1065
00:48:21,722 --> 00:48:23,003
Are you really going to the Langya League?

1066
00:48:30,643 --> 00:48:32,043
Don't worry about where I'm going.

1067
00:48:33,163 --> 00:48:34,563
Mind your own business.

1068
00:48:34,963 --> 00:48:35,722
The team will be eliminated soon.

1069
00:48:35,722 --> 00:48:36,882
Are you still fighting here?

1070
00:48:37,322 --> 00:48:38,402
You can't compete well.

1071
00:48:38,603 --> 00:48:39,603
A lot of things.

1072
00:48:39,963 --> 00:48:40,963
Leave now.

1073
00:48:41,163 --> 00:48:41,882
A bunch of them.

1074
00:48:42,603 --> 00:48:43,643
A bunch of losers.

1075
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:05,563
Actually, me too.
