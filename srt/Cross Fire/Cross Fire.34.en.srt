1
00:02:44,002 --> 00:02:45,602
Hello, hello.

2
00:02:45,923 --> 00:02:47,963
Please register here.

3
00:02:47,963 --> 00:02:49,003
I'll hold it.

4
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:50,842
I'll register your passport for you.

5
00:02:54,043 --> 00:02:54,882
Hello, hello.

6
00:02:54,882 --> 00:02:55,283
Hello

7
00:02:55,283 --> 00:02:56,003
What's your name

8
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:57,842
I'm Sandra.

9
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,283
My name is Cheng Hao.

10
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:00,083
ChengHao

11
00:03:00,802 --> 00:03:01,763
Brother Feng,

12
00:03:03,043 --> 00:03:03,643
to be sorry

13
00:03:04,043 --> 00:03:05,083
There's something wrong with your mind.

14
00:03:05,283 --> 00:03:06,162
I know.

15
00:03:06,522 --> 00:03:09,003
The Super League teams

16
00:03:09,003 --> 00:03:11,003
There are 16 of them.

17
00:03:11,003 --> 00:03:12,643
In the group stage,

18
00:03:12,643 --> 00:03:16,442
Will be drawn into four teams.

19
00:03:16,442 --> 00:03:17,842
Each team has four teams.

20
00:03:17,842 --> 00:03:19,723
The round robin battle.

21
00:03:19,723 --> 00:03:20,763
After the introduction,

22
00:03:20,763 --> 00:03:22,842
After the relevant information of this event,

23
00:03:22,842 --> 00:03:24,122
We'll first enter

24
00:03:24,122 --> 00:03:25,763
In the Super League,

25
00:03:25,763 --> 00:03:27,883
The group stage team draw.

26
00:03:29,362 --> 00:03:31,202
The draw judge.

27
00:03:31,202 --> 00:03:34,403
Please draw the first team of Group A.

28
00:03:53,043 --> 00:03:53,523
OK

29
00:03:53,922 --> 00:03:56,002
The first team of Group A

30
00:03:57,323 --> 00:03:59,562
Is a team from China.

31
00:03:59,562 --> 00:04:01,202
congratulations

32
00:04:01,202 --> 00:04:02,122
Thank you

33
00:04:02,122 --> 00:04:03,403
Cheers!

34
00:04:03,403 --> 00:04:04,683
It seems that the opening game

35
00:04:04,683 --> 00:04:06,122
We have to go first.

36
00:04:06,443 --> 00:04:08,202
I just don't know which team I will meet.

37
00:04:08,523 --> 00:04:09,683
I hope it's TNT.

38
00:04:10,922 --> 00:04:12,122
They are also seeded players.

39
00:04:12,122 --> 00:04:13,323
We won't meet in the first round.

40
00:04:14,122 --> 00:04:15,082
I heard that

41
00:04:15,282 --> 00:04:16,323
Among the sixteen teams,

42
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:18,482
BTON is the weakest.

43
00:04:18,482 --> 00:04:20,202
It would be great if we ran into them.

44
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,603
The second team of Group A

45
00:04:24,603 --> 00:04:27,362
Is a BTON team from the Philippines.

46
00:04:27,362 --> 00:04:28,482
Sure, Cheng Hao.

47
00:04:28,482 --> 00:04:30,323
This time, the dog spit out the ivory.

48
00:04:31,283 --> 00:04:32,682
It's called golden words.

49
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,642
Before I came, I checked the files of the Philippine team.

50
00:04:37,003 --> 00:04:38,202
Although last year's World Series

51
00:04:38,202 --> 00:04:38,843
The result is not good.

52
00:04:39,283 --> 00:04:40,723
But we have two new players this year.

53
00:04:40,723 --> 00:04:41,563
You're good at shooting.

54
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:44,443
They played three warm-up matches.

55
00:04:44,443 --> 00:04:45,242
Three losses.

56
00:04:45,723 --> 00:04:46,723
And lost a lot.

57
00:04:48,563 --> 00:04:49,883
Especially with Egypt.

58
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,163
The worst game.

59
00:04:51,763 --> 00:04:52,883
He was beaten ten to two.

60
00:04:54,763 --> 00:04:56,043
It could be a smoke bomb.

61
00:04:56,962 --> 00:04:58,043
BTON for three consecutive years

62
00:04:58,043 --> 00:04:59,443
From the Philippines.

63
00:04:59,802 --> 00:05:00,763
Is definitely not weak.

64
00:05:01,482 --> 00:05:03,763
Okay, we see the C team.

65
00:05:04,563 --> 00:05:07,163
It's a Japanese TNT team.

66
00:05:07,522 --> 00:05:09,202
These teams are all traditional teams.

67
00:05:09,482 --> 00:05:11,642
But TNT is so strong this year.

68
00:05:11,962 --> 00:05:13,362
With TNT.

69
00:05:13,362 --> 00:05:14,202
They will suffer.

70
00:05:15,163 --> 00:05:17,163
I heard that the Japanese team has white people.

71
00:05:17,163 --> 00:05:17,843
Really?

72
00:05:18,163 --> 00:05:19,802
You can call for help in international competitions.

73
00:05:19,802 --> 00:05:20,763
Seems to be German.

74
00:05:20,763 --> 00:05:21,843
But he's Japanese now.

75
00:05:22,123 --> 00:05:22,962
Do you think

76
00:05:23,763 --> 00:05:24,922
Will Xu Wei appear?

77
00:05:28,242 --> 00:05:29,323
With Xu Wei's personality,

78
00:05:30,522 --> 00:05:31,723
He would hide behind his back.

79
00:05:32,642 --> 00:05:34,003
Unless we have to,

80
00:05:42,603 --> 00:05:44,482
Ladies and gentlemen,

81
00:05:44,482 --> 00:05:47,922
The new season has begun.

82
00:05:47,922 --> 00:05:50,443
The BTON team from the Philippines.

83
00:05:54,202 --> 00:05:55,642
They will fight.

84
00:05:55,642 --> 00:05:58,763
The Chinese champions continue to fight.

85
00:06:02,922 --> 00:06:05,082
One is a very experienced team.

86
00:06:05,082 --> 00:06:08,522
They won the competition this season.

87
00:06:08,522 --> 00:06:11,323
The other young team is a dark horse.

88
00:06:11,323 --> 00:06:13,362
It just won the championship.

89
00:06:13,682 --> 00:06:15,242
Which team is likely to win?

90
00:06:15,563 --> 00:06:16,563
Let's wait and see.

91
00:06:16,563 --> 00:06:19,323
The game is about to begin.

92
00:06:20,362 --> 00:06:22,323
Welcome to the opening match.

93
00:06:22,323 --> 00:06:24,043
The two teams are relatively

94
00:06:24,043 --> 00:06:26,402
BTON is a battle-tested team.

95
00:06:27,123 --> 00:06:29,323
And the team from China

96
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:30,843
Is a young team.

97
00:06:30,843 --> 00:06:32,323
It's like a dark horse.

98
00:06:32,323 --> 00:06:34,202
Suddenly appeared in front of everyone.

99
00:06:34,202 --> 00:06:35,483
Okay, first, let's have a look.

100
00:06:35,483 --> 00:06:36,883
Continue to the team.

101
00:06:36,883 --> 00:06:38,282
The first is our captain.

102
00:06:38,282 --> 00:06:39,683
Sniper North.

103
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:40,642
You're welcome.

104
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:45,483
Breakthrough player Kai.

105
00:06:47,602 --> 00:06:49,123
Breakthrough Player S + 1

106
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,323
A breakthrough, Nezha.

107
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,883
And the sniper King.

108
00:06:57,363 --> 00:07:00,042
BTON team captain Ryan

109
00:07:00,483 --> 00:07:02,402
Sniper RafNash

110
00:07:02,402 --> 00:07:04,683
This is BTON's third Premier League appearance

111
00:07:05,162 --> 00:07:06,483
Although he has participated many times,

112
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:08,563
But I didn't get a good result.

113
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,162
And the team that continues to be hot recently,

114
00:07:11,483 --> 00:07:13,282
Can play against BTON in the first game.

115
00:07:13,722 --> 00:07:15,962
It's definitely a sign for them.

116
00:07:16,443 --> 00:07:18,123
Okay, the game is about to begin.

117
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:19,803
Please go to the battle room.

118
00:07:20,923 --> 00:07:22,363
It's said that the Super League

119
00:07:22,363 --> 00:07:24,522
The team has invited great figures.

120
00:07:25,082 --> 00:07:26,803
Xiao Feng Seven will be their coach.

121
00:07:27,243 --> 00:07:29,042
Xiao Feng is the Chinese National Challenge Champion.

122
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:29,923
The first champion.

123
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:31,962
But I haven't heard from him for years.

124
00:07:32,162 --> 00:07:33,282
Seems to have disappeared.

125
00:07:33,722 --> 00:07:34,763
As promised,

126
00:07:35,003 --> 00:07:36,282
Take the initiative first.

127
00:07:36,282 --> 00:07:37,323
To explore the opponent's ways.

128
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:42,842
Come on.

129
00:07:47,522 --> 00:07:48,443
Go on.

130
00:07:48,443 --> 00:07:49,363
Come on

131
00:07:50,282 --> 00:07:51,162
Come on

132
00:07:54,162 --> 00:07:56,123
The team's Premier League debut continues.

133
00:07:56,123 --> 00:07:57,082
Start now.

134
00:07:58,683 --> 00:07:59,323
This competition

135
00:07:59,683 --> 00:08:01,243
What tactics will the team use?

136
00:08:01,243 --> 00:08:02,522
Against BTON?

137
00:08:02,522 --> 00:08:04,243
Let's wait and see.

138
00:08:04,803 --> 00:08:05,923
Come on.

139
00:08:07,323 --> 00:08:08,683
Let's start at point B with a quick attack.

140
00:08:08,683 --> 00:08:09,842
S + 1A point, throw the props.

141
00:08:09,842 --> 00:08:10,602
Copy that, Captain.

142
00:08:22,363 --> 00:08:23,642
Judging from the operation,

143
00:08:23,642 --> 00:08:25,483
Go on. The team used their usual tactics.

144
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:27,042
I'm at the location. Bag A is empty.

145
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:28,363
S + 1 Garrison A Package

146
00:08:30,003 --> 00:08:31,683
The middle door, I sealed the smoke and prepared the package.

147
00:08:31,683 --> 00:08:33,003
King sealed the smoke in the middle door.

148
00:08:34,123 --> 00:08:35,443
Kai, cover Nezha's bag.

149
00:08:38,323 --> 00:08:39,162
Someone is here.

150
00:08:39,522 --> 00:08:40,123
Watch your back.

151
00:08:41,803 --> 00:08:42,323
I dropped it.

152
00:08:42,323 --> 00:08:43,842
BTON went around and shot King.

153
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:48,363
The middle one.

154
00:08:49,123 --> 00:08:49,803
Two

155
00:08:50,282 --> 00:08:51,042
They're all here.

156
00:08:51,042 --> 00:08:51,642
fast break

157
00:08:51,642 --> 00:08:53,202
BTON attacked.

158
00:08:53,202 --> 00:08:55,003
See if they can successfully

159
00:08:55,003 --> 00:08:56,042
To score.

160
00:08:56,522 --> 00:08:57,003
One

161
00:08:58,563 --> 00:08:59,202
I'll fix it.

162
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:02,722
Hold on. Don't worry.

163
00:09:02,722 --> 00:09:04,282
I didn't expect the first round of the opening game

164
00:09:04,282 --> 00:09:06,363
There was a wonderful double play.

165
00:09:06,363 --> 00:09:07,642
Go on. All that is left is

166
00:09:07,642 --> 00:09:09,003
Lu Xiao Bei and S + 1

167
00:09:09,003 --> 00:09:09,803
I'm going to help.

168
00:09:14,602 --> 00:09:15,202
I dropped it.

169
00:09:15,803 --> 00:09:16,683
And S + 1.

170
00:09:17,162 --> 00:09:18,842
The first battle was not smooth.

171
00:09:19,522 --> 00:09:21,803
Now, the captain of the team, Lu Xiaobei,

172
00:09:21,803 --> 00:09:23,042
Facing a one-to-five situation.

173
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:24,962
And Xiao Bei's location is not very good.

174
00:09:25,243 --> 00:09:27,003
This is an almost impossible task.

175
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,483
The situation is very bad.

176
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:31,123
One off.

177
00:09:31,123 --> 00:09:31,522
Nice. Nice gun.

178
00:09:31,522 --> 00:09:32,803
Lu Xiao Bei knocked one out.

179
00:09:33,123 --> 00:09:34,082
BTON has three more.

180
00:09:35,803 --> 00:09:36,363
I got it.

181
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:37,642
But it didn't kill him.

182
00:09:37,642 --> 00:09:38,483
Come with me.

183
00:09:38,483 --> 00:09:39,683
The momentum of BTON is strong.

184
00:09:39,683 --> 00:09:40,522
They launched a group attack.

185
00:09:40,923 --> 00:09:42,123
Can Lu Xiao Bei hold it?

186
00:09:46,763 --> 00:09:47,722
Or outnumbered?

187
00:09:48,483 --> 00:09:49,923
BTON won the round first.

188
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,483
For the first time in the Premier League.

189
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:53,243
When I came here,

190
00:09:53,243 --> 00:09:54,602
So I got a cold shoulder.

191
00:09:55,123 --> 00:09:56,003
it doesn't matter

192
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:57,483
The next wave, keep playing B.

193
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,363
They seem to know our tactics well.

194
00:09:59,883 --> 00:10:01,602
They must have touched our bottom.

195
00:10:01,683 --> 00:10:02,642
Please pay attention.

196
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,402
The breakout player in front of B

197
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:05,522
Next, if you can.

198
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,202
Take him off first.

199
00:10:06,842 --> 00:10:07,443
understand

200
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:12,683
The score is five to one.

201
00:10:12,842 --> 00:10:14,042
Continue to fall behind.

202
00:10:14,202 --> 00:10:15,243
BTON is still attacking.

203
00:10:15,243 --> 00:10:16,563
They came from the middle.

204
00:10:16,563 --> 00:10:17,722
Hold on. Come on.

205
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,042
We lost one in the middle.

206
00:10:21,202 --> 00:10:21,563
pretty

207
00:10:21,563 --> 00:10:23,202
Go on. The battle team will choose the front.

208
00:10:23,202 --> 00:10:24,962
They counter-attacked from the middle.

209
00:10:26,082 --> 00:10:26,803
pretty

210
00:10:26,803 --> 00:10:27,683
Doublekill

211
00:10:27,683 --> 00:10:29,003
North has attacked two soldiers.

212
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:30,683
There's another one in the middle.

213
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:32,202
S + 1 flank.

214
00:10:32,202 --> 00:10:32,683
Received

215
00:10:33,962 --> 00:10:35,923
The team seems to have found some form.

216
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:39,483
I dropped it on the A track.

217
00:10:39,483 --> 00:10:40,483
I'll transfer to A.

218
00:10:42,763 --> 00:10:43,602
Be careful

219
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:44,563
To the back.

220
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:46,683
I dropped it.

221
00:10:46,683 --> 00:10:47,922
BTON, once again.

222
00:10:47,922 --> 00:10:49,562
The team's newly ignited momentum

223
00:10:49,562 --> 00:10:50,603
It's gone out again.

224
00:10:52,003 --> 00:10:53,522
BTON is really getting stronger.

225
00:10:56,682 --> 00:10:57,802
A, Bai, you can go.

226
00:10:57,802 --> 00:10:58,243
I'll go.

227
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:03,042
King was attacked.

228
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:04,363
pretty

229
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,003
it doesn't matter

230
00:11:05,483 --> 00:11:06,402
Kai also dropped.

231
00:11:06,642 --> 00:11:08,642
And went back to the situation.

232
00:11:08,642 --> 00:11:09,282
Go on.

233
00:11:09,282 --> 00:11:10,883
Captain North is the only one left.

234
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:12,442
It seems that

235
00:11:12,442 --> 00:11:13,642
BTON is going to be cold.

236
00:11:20,562 --> 00:11:21,562
One more point for BTON.

237
00:11:21,843 --> 00:11:22,802
To win the first round.

238
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:24,483
Go on. The team hasn't played at all.

239
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:25,363
The proper condition.

240
00:11:25,763 --> 00:11:27,042
BTON wins.

241
00:11:27,322 --> 00:11:28,723
The total score is one-nil.

242
00:11:28,963 --> 00:11:30,042
Continue to fall behind.

243
00:11:38,363 --> 00:11:39,682
The Philippine team is not weak at all.

244
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,123
They are well prepared.

245
00:11:41,402 --> 00:11:42,562
I think they are actors.

246
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:44,003
Their acting is so great.

247
00:11:44,402 --> 00:11:46,402
He didn't do anything in the warm-up.

248
00:11:50,763 --> 00:11:51,282
come

249
00:11:51,883 --> 00:11:52,963
It's okay.

250
00:11:53,603 --> 00:11:54,162
Nothing

251
00:11:54,843 --> 00:11:55,603
Remember that

252
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:57,123
Be patient.

253
00:11:57,802 --> 00:11:59,003
learn to walk before you run

254
00:11:59,003 --> 00:11:59,922
Don't take the second bite.

255
00:12:02,562 --> 00:12:03,562
They're not good at shooting.

256
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,723
You know our tactics well.

257
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,603
You can beat us in almost every round.

258
00:12:08,922 --> 00:12:10,042
From the next round,

259
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:11,402
We'll play the opposite strategy.

260
00:12:11,402 --> 00:12:12,603
Change B to A.

261
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:14,123
You should defend first.

262
00:12:14,123 --> 00:12:15,483
To attack again.

263
00:12:15,843 --> 00:12:16,843
From now on,

264
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,243
We're playing mind games with them.

265
00:12:18,642 --> 00:12:19,963
When they react,

266
00:12:19,963 --> 00:12:21,003
We can change back immediately.

267
00:12:21,603 --> 00:12:23,322
We have to take them into the pit.

268
00:12:24,682 --> 00:12:25,203
that's right

269
00:12:25,642 --> 00:12:27,123
Don't be under pressure.

270
00:12:27,562 --> 00:12:28,483
From this one,

271
00:12:28,562 --> 00:12:30,203
Every round will start zero to zero.

272
00:12:37,162 --> 00:12:39,003
If you can't even win the Philippines,

273
00:12:39,402 --> 00:12:40,883
I'll buy a plane ticket and fly back.

274
00:12:41,282 --> 00:12:42,162
Don't worry.

275
00:12:42,483 --> 00:12:43,243
You can't leave.

276
00:12:46,483 --> 00:12:47,282
Then go for it.

277
00:12:47,883 --> 00:12:49,123
To the level of training.

278
00:12:49,723 --> 00:12:50,123
come

279
00:12:50,963 --> 00:12:52,402
The second round will begin soon.

280
00:12:52,402 --> 00:13:05,483
Go Team China.

281
00:13:07,522 --> 00:13:08,843
The last game continues.

282
00:13:08,843 --> 00:13:10,442
Didn't play as well as they should.

283
00:13:11,243 --> 00:13:12,282
I believe that after adjustment,

284
00:13:12,282 --> 00:13:14,322
The team will regain its status.

285
00:13:21,562 --> 00:13:22,522
I'm in the middle.

286
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:25,562
I hid it.

287
00:13:26,243 --> 00:13:27,483
Wang Kai and I will stay where we are.

288
00:13:27,483 --> 00:13:28,123
Hold on.

289
00:13:28,402 --> 00:13:29,402
Take away their morale.

290
00:13:29,402 --> 00:13:30,003
Don't worry.

291
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:31,603
Wait for Red Seconds, let's go together.

292
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:32,442
This round,

293
00:13:32,442 --> 00:13:34,203
Go on. The team chose to stay in position.

294
00:13:34,642 --> 00:13:36,442
They made obvious tactical changes.

295
00:13:47,963 --> 00:13:49,123
Ten seconds.

296
00:13:49,123 --> 00:13:50,603
Wang Kai, S + 1 and A.

297
00:13:50,603 --> 00:13:51,763
Nezha and King B order the bag.

298
00:13:53,642 --> 00:13:54,642
five

299
00:13:54,642 --> 00:13:55,682
four

300
00:13:55,682 --> 00:13:56,562
three

301
00:13:56,562 --> 00:13:57,642
two

302
00:13:57,642 --> 00:13:58,003
one

303
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:58,682
punching

304
00:13:58,682 --> 00:13:59,203
Received

305
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,003
Warehouse B is flashing white.

306
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:13,922
Get rid of one.

307
00:14:17,922 --> 00:14:18,682
Two

308
00:14:18,682 --> 00:14:19,282
Nice gun.

309
00:14:19,282 --> 00:14:19,922
pretty

310
00:14:22,123 --> 00:14:22,682
Three

311
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,042
That's nice. Nice gun.

312
00:14:29,642 --> 00:14:30,203
support

313
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:30,922
Support B.

314
00:14:30,922 --> 00:14:31,402
Received

315
00:14:35,162 --> 00:14:36,203
I sealed the cigarette, King.

316
00:14:37,562 --> 00:14:38,162
You can go.

317
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:44,003
pretty

318
00:14:57,723 --> 00:14:58,442
pretty

319
00:14:58,802 --> 00:14:59,723
The opponent's advantage.

320
00:14:59,723 --> 00:15:01,402
Is to understand our previous skills and tactics.

321
00:15:01,763 --> 00:15:03,402
And then change the tactics.

322
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,603
As long as we change,

323
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:05,802
They can't do anything.

324
00:15:05,802 --> 00:15:06,402
good

325
00:15:06,402 --> 00:15:07,562
In the next round, we'll go straight to A.

326
00:15:07,562 --> 00:15:08,723
Don't give them a chance to react.

327
00:15:08,723 --> 00:15:09,243
Received

328
00:15:19,363 --> 00:15:21,162
The situation has changed.

329
00:15:21,802 --> 00:15:24,123
BTON players seem to be unable to play.

330
00:15:24,442 --> 00:15:26,402
Their condition is declining very seriously.

331
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:27,562
One off.

332
00:15:27,562 --> 00:15:28,922
pretty

333
00:15:31,243 --> 00:15:31,963
Two.

334
00:15:32,402 --> 00:15:32,883
Nice gun.

335
00:15:32,883 --> 00:15:33,322
pretty

336
00:15:33,322 --> 00:15:34,603
I don't think so.

337
00:15:34,603 --> 00:15:35,763
The decline is so serious.

338
00:15:36,123 --> 00:15:37,123
But to continue the team.

339
00:15:37,123 --> 00:15:38,243
The change here

340
00:15:38,243 --> 00:15:39,003
Received a miracle.

341
00:15:39,003 --> 00:15:39,883
One off.

342
00:15:39,883 --> 00:15:40,282
Received

343
00:15:40,483 --> 00:15:41,522
It can be rushed.

344
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:44,322
I saw two.

345
00:15:44,322 --> 00:15:45,322
Point B, I dropped one.

346
00:15:45,322 --> 00:15:46,363
Watch your back.

347
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:47,203
You can put a gun in the back.

348
00:15:47,402 --> 00:15:48,123
Big A.

349
00:15:48,123 --> 00:15:49,162
see

350
00:15:49,162 --> 00:15:50,723
The last one, don't worry.

351
00:15:50,723 --> 00:15:51,682
We have many people. Don't worry.

352
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:52,402
The last one.

353
00:15:58,682 --> 00:15:59,682
pretty

354
00:16:00,843 --> 00:16:01,723
pretty

355
00:16:03,723 --> 00:16:05,642
As the team continues to defeat the last one,

356
00:16:06,203 --> 00:16:08,483
The score of the game is fixed at ten to three.

357
00:16:09,442 --> 00:16:11,282
The score is 2-1.

358
00:16:11,282 --> 00:16:12,243
Reversal of the Philippines

359
00:16:12,522 --> 00:16:15,162
Won their first international match.

360
00:16:16,003 --> 00:16:17,843
That's right. Congratulations.

361
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,123
Congratulations, you're the first team.

362
00:16:20,123 --> 00:16:21,483
The semi-finalists

363
00:16:21,483 --> 00:16:23,642
Congratulations to the team from China.

364
00:16:23,642 --> 00:16:26,723
Defeated the Philippines BTON team.

365
00:16:26,723 --> 00:16:29,203
Won the opening battle.

366
00:16:33,363 --> 00:16:35,162
For the other semi-final of this competition.

367
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:37,363
Will be between Japan and Indonesia.

368
00:16:37,642 --> 00:16:39,922
Japan TNT is the favorite to win the competition.

369
00:16:42,843 --> 00:16:44,562
TNT has won many times.

370
00:16:44,562 --> 00:16:46,203
The best sniper.

371
00:16:50,963 --> 00:16:52,203
So strong, Machine.

372
00:16:52,723 --> 00:16:54,363
The game is still so hot.

373
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,282
With Machine getting the second five kills,

374
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:06,843
Japan TNT takes the game

375
00:17:07,282 --> 00:17:10,883
The Japanese TNT team played a perfect battle.

376
00:17:10,883 --> 00:17:12,802
They defeated them 2-0 on aggregate.

377
00:17:12,802 --> 00:17:15,123
Indonesia's CAPA team

378
00:17:15,483 --> 00:17:18,042
Congratulations to Japan TNT for the victory.

379
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:19,083
congratulations

380
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,322
In the semi-finals,

381
00:17:20,322 --> 00:17:21,843
The Chinese battle team.

382
00:17:21,843 --> 00:17:24,322
Will be a TNT team from Japan.

383
00:17:29,603 --> 00:17:31,363
Xu Wei hasn't shown up these days.

384
00:17:32,162 --> 00:17:33,522
Chu Ge also went to the competition committee.

385
00:17:34,322 --> 00:17:35,603
I didn't know who he was.

386
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,442
The Japanese team's game video these days.

387
00:17:42,682 --> 00:17:43,162
I've read it.

388
00:17:44,003 --> 00:17:44,763
The more you look,

389
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,843
We're playing the semi-finals with TNT tomorrow.

390
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:51,042
There's nothing we can do now.

391
00:17:51,042 --> 00:17:52,402
To find out if he's the one.

392
00:17:52,883 --> 00:17:54,642
I feel like I am suffocating.

393
00:17:57,922 --> 00:17:58,843
I suspect that

394
00:17:59,883 --> 00:18:01,802
Is it because we want revenge too much?

395
00:18:02,402 --> 00:18:03,603
So I got the illusion.

396
00:18:06,922 --> 00:18:08,442
You have to trust your instincts.

397
00:18:09,162 --> 00:18:09,883
It's not wrong.

398
00:18:13,123 --> 00:18:14,162
The match committee said

399
00:18:14,162 --> 00:18:15,723
TNT is in the training room on the second floor.

400
00:18:15,723 --> 00:18:16,642
Before the game starts,

401
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:17,963
Do you want to have a look?

402
00:18:51,522 --> 00:18:53,442
Why did the Japanese team use Chinese materials?

403
00:19:01,203 --> 00:19:01,922
Excuse me.

404
00:19:01,922 --> 00:19:03,003
Where did the TNT team go?

405
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:04,843
They just left.

406
00:19:05,282 --> 00:19:06,042
She said they just left.

407
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:21,923
to wait a moment

408
00:19:27,683 --> 00:19:29,842
Where is the gym?

409
00:19:29,842 --> 00:19:31,643
I don't know. Sorry.

410
00:19:39,443 --> 00:19:40,322
Let's talk about it at the end.

411
00:19:40,322 --> 00:19:41,443
The double frames of the Defender Middle Road.

412
00:19:42,003 --> 00:19:42,683
Sniper platform

413
00:19:42,842 --> 00:19:43,362
A door.

414
00:19:44,122 --> 00:19:44,763
When I stuck the door A,

415
00:19:44,763 --> 00:19:45,963
Be careful to go inside.

416
00:19:46,243 --> 00:19:47,802
If the sleeper jumped into the high box,

417
00:19:47,802 --> 00:19:48,723
You can go through door A.

418
00:19:49,042 --> 00:19:50,203
Machine.

419
00:19:50,203 --> 00:19:51,483
It was used in Egypt.

420
00:19:52,122 --> 00:19:52,403
Yes

421
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:54,723
Look, there's a billboard at the gate of A.

422
00:19:55,243 --> 00:19:56,602
You can use the frame people to jump on it.

423
00:19:56,602 --> 00:19:58,243
The next one on the billboard

424
00:19:58,362 --> 00:19:59,683
Can form a high and low double card.

425
00:20:00,243 --> 00:20:01,562
If the opponent breaks through the middle,

426
00:20:01,562 --> 00:20:02,562
Is enough for them to drink.

427
00:20:02,882 --> 00:20:04,282
You must pay attention when you're stuck.

428
00:20:04,282 --> 00:20:05,443
Don't go out in a hurry.

429
00:20:05,443 --> 00:20:06,842
It's easy to be attacked because of the bad terrain.

430
00:20:07,562 --> 00:20:09,362
As long as possible to wait for the teammates to return to defense.

431
00:20:09,683 --> 00:20:10,963
And then brush them off again.

432
00:20:12,082 --> 00:20:13,403
Alright, let's stop here today.

433
00:20:13,802 --> 00:20:14,522
We'll fight in Japan tomorrow.

434
00:20:14,522 --> 00:20:15,443
You should take a good rest.

435
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:16,802
Go back.

436
00:20:17,562 --> 00:20:19,122
Who has instant noodles?

437
00:20:19,562 --> 00:20:20,723
I'm too hungry in the middle of the night.

438
00:20:20,882 --> 00:20:22,443
I ate them all last night.

439
00:20:22,443 --> 00:20:24,042
Why don't we go downstairs and have some?

440
00:20:24,643 --> 00:20:25,842
It's 11: 30.

441
00:20:25,842 --> 00:20:27,483
All the restaurants in the hotel are closed.

442
00:20:27,763 --> 00:20:29,683
I remember there's a restaurant across the road.

443
00:20:29,683 --> 00:20:30,643
It should still be open.

444
00:20:30,923 --> 00:20:32,203
Sure. Let's go.

445
00:20:32,322 --> 00:20:32,842
go

446
00:20:33,322 --> 00:20:35,122
Feng, have a midnight snack.

447
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:36,483
I'm not going.

448
00:20:36,763 --> 00:20:37,802
An Lan flight will arrive soon.

449
00:20:37,923 --> 00:20:38,522
I'll wait for her.

450
00:20:39,282 --> 00:20:40,882
Okay, we'll pack it for you.

451
00:20:41,243 --> 00:20:41,723
Let's go.

452
00:20:41,723 --> 00:20:43,122
Come back early and rest.

453
00:20:43,122 --> 00:20:43,842
I know.

454
00:20:43,963 --> 00:20:44,842
Bye, Brother Feng.

455
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,483
Come to Chuge and eat more.

456
00:20:56,082 --> 00:20:56,522
Come on.

457
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:57,282
Eat more meat.

458
00:20:57,282 --> 00:20:57,923
Long body.

459
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,923
You can grow tall.

460
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:00,122
Work hard tomorrow.

461
00:21:01,243 --> 00:21:01,882
When do you think

462
00:21:01,882 --> 00:21:03,403
Can shoot a double ten sniper rifle.

463
00:21:04,042 --> 00:21:05,203
You're so pretty.

464
00:21:07,003 --> 00:21:07,562
come

465
00:21:07,882 --> 00:21:09,122
Why did you give it back?

466
00:21:09,322 --> 00:21:10,163
Long body.

467
00:21:13,203 --> 00:21:13,602
Is it enough?

468
00:21:13,602 --> 00:21:15,602
What are Feng and An Lan doing up there?

469
00:21:15,602 --> 00:21:16,443
What else can we do?

470
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:17,443
Must be playing games.

471
00:21:17,763 --> 00:21:18,522
Then tell me.

472
00:21:19,203 --> 00:21:21,042
Brother Feng has been sleeping for 11 years.

473
00:21:21,042 --> 00:21:23,003
Can you still get back the feeling of pressing the gun?

474
00:21:26,882 --> 00:21:28,723
I don't think you need to worry about it.

475
00:21:28,923 --> 00:21:30,362
An Lan will definitely help him.

476
00:21:33,163 --> 00:21:33,923
What are you laughing at?

477
00:21:34,802 --> 00:21:35,602
What are you laughing at?

478
00:21:35,923 --> 00:21:37,003
Tell me about it.

479
00:21:37,243 --> 00:21:37,882
Eat more.

480
00:21:38,802 --> 00:21:39,243
Long body.

481
00:21:39,683 --> 00:21:40,243
What are you laughing at?

482
00:21:42,683 --> 00:21:43,763
Don't ask this.

483
00:21:44,602 --> 00:21:45,282
Have a meal.

484
00:21:57,882 --> 00:21:58,763
Did you hear that?

485
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:01,042
Beauty

486
00:22:02,122 --> 00:22:02,763
What are you doing?

487
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:05,443
I

488
00:22:06,643 --> 00:22:07,203
how could that be?

489
00:22:07,882 --> 00:22:09,163
I didn't do anything.

490
00:22:09,163 --> 00:22:10,082
I didn't push.

491
00:22:13,243 --> 00:22:14,003
And touch the porcelain?

492
00:22:14,882 --> 00:22:15,203
I

493
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:17,483
I didn't push.

494
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:18,163
Are you all right?

495
00:22:18,522 --> 00:22:19,042
What are you doing?

496
00:22:19,522 --> 00:22:20,163
What are you doing?

497
00:22:20,163 --> 00:22:20,443
Take a look.

498
00:22:20,443 --> 00:22:21,163
Are you all right?

499
00:22:21,443 --> 00:22:22,163
What's wrong?

500
00:22:22,643 --> 00:22:22,963
I

501
00:22:22,963 --> 00:22:23,763
Is there anything else?

502
00:22:23,763 --> 00:22:24,522
Dude,

503
00:22:24,522 --> 00:22:25,322
Ask her.

504
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:27,403
Are you all right

505
00:22:29,122 --> 00:22:29,763
What happened

506
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:31,003
Are you all right?

507
00:22:32,923 --> 00:22:33,443
I

508
00:22:34,643 --> 00:22:35,362
What are you doing?

509
00:22:37,243 --> 00:22:38,042
What are you doing?

510
00:22:38,042 --> 00:22:38,763
Stop fighting.

511
00:22:42,203 --> 00:22:42,683
Don't hit me.

512
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:44,082
Don't hit me.

513
00:22:44,082 --> 00:22:44,842
It's him.

514
00:22:47,243 --> 00:22:48,042
what are you doing?

515
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:00,723
what are you doing?

516
00:23:18,882 --> 00:23:19,802
go

517
00:23:29,602 --> 00:23:30,362
Let's go.

518
00:23:33,723 --> 00:23:34,602
What's wrong?

519
00:23:36,322 --> 00:23:36,923
Xiaobei

520
00:23:37,763 --> 00:23:38,203
Stop fighting.

521
00:23:38,562 --> 00:23:39,003
Xiaobei

522
00:23:39,003 --> 00:23:39,562
Xiaobei

523
00:23:39,802 --> 00:23:40,683
Are you all right?

524
00:23:48,882 --> 00:23:50,122
Xiaobei

525
00:23:51,003 --> 00:23:51,763
Su Jiayi.

526
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,163
Su Jiayi, call the police.

527
00:23:53,163 --> 00:23:54,802
Call 120.

528
00:24:06,723 --> 00:24:07,203
Xiaobei

529
00:24:07,203 --> 00:24:08,923
Be patient. I'll urge you.

530
00:24:13,923 --> 00:24:14,562
Brother Feng,

531
00:24:14,963 --> 00:24:15,723
Match

532
00:24:16,882 --> 00:24:17,763
Tomorrow's competition

533
00:24:18,483 --> 00:24:19,602
I can't miss it.

534
00:24:21,643 --> 00:24:22,842
Let's talk about the competition tomorrow.

535
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,122
Go back to the hotel and rest.

536
00:24:26,683 --> 00:24:27,763
Just leave me and Chu Ge.

537
00:24:28,163 --> 00:24:29,362
Why are you going back to the hotel?

538
00:24:29,522 --> 00:24:30,042
Sleep

539
00:24:30,362 --> 00:24:30,802
Brother Feng,

540
00:24:31,082 --> 00:24:32,522
Who can fall asleep after such a big event?

541
00:24:32,842 --> 00:24:34,203
You're competing tomorrow morning.

542
00:24:34,403 --> 00:24:35,683
You must have a good rest tonight.

543
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:36,923
Xiao Bei's hand is so injured.

544
00:24:36,923 --> 00:24:38,602
We are not in the mood to sleep.

545
00:24:40,282 --> 00:24:41,763
I suspect the opponent did this.

546
00:24:42,443 --> 00:24:43,483
It must be Xu Wei.

547
00:24:43,923 --> 00:24:44,963
What he can do,

548
00:24:47,882 --> 00:24:49,122
Go to him.

549
00:24:49,122 --> 00:24:49,963
Let's go now.

550
00:24:50,163 --> 00:24:50,683
come back

551
00:24:51,203 --> 00:24:51,802
No

552
00:24:52,122 --> 00:24:52,802
Calm down.

553
00:24:54,322 --> 00:24:55,483
Did Xu Wei do it?

554
00:24:55,483 --> 00:24:56,643
We have no evidence now.

555
00:24:57,443 --> 00:24:58,643
If the opponent did it,

556
00:24:59,403 --> 00:25:00,443
How about this?

557
00:25:00,443 --> 00:25:01,643
Their goal will be achieved.

558
00:25:04,802 --> 00:25:06,243
I'm as angry as you.

559
00:25:06,602 --> 00:25:08,122
But you are professional athletes.

560
00:25:08,122 --> 00:25:10,082
You represent the country and come here to play.

561
00:25:10,562 --> 00:25:12,122
Whether on or off the court,

562
00:25:12,122 --> 00:25:13,322
To stay awake all the time.

563
00:25:13,683 --> 00:25:15,602
You can't ignore everything when you're hot.

564
00:25:19,403 --> 00:25:20,163
Xiao Bei is injured.

565
00:25:20,443 --> 00:25:21,842
Is a great loss to us.

566
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:24,082
You should know better now.

567
00:25:24,082 --> 00:25:24,963
What are you going to do?

568
00:25:25,882 --> 00:25:26,802
Go back to the hotel now.

569
00:25:27,362 --> 00:25:28,122
Have a good sleep.

570
00:25:28,643 --> 00:25:29,443
And raise your spirits.

571
00:25:29,723 --> 00:25:30,763
Play well tomorrow.

572
00:25:31,082 --> 00:25:32,322
You are helping yourself.

573
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,282
To help Xiao Bei.

574
00:25:37,923 --> 00:25:38,282
WangKai

575
00:25:40,282 --> 00:25:41,003
Take everyone back.

576
00:25:51,042 --> 00:25:52,163
Listen to Brother Feng.

577
00:25:52,562 --> 00:25:53,443
Go back.

578
00:25:54,122 --> 00:25:54,643
Kai

579
00:25:54,963 --> 00:25:55,483
Go back.

580
00:26:23,443 --> 00:26:24,163
Don't worry.

581
00:26:24,322 --> 00:26:26,042
Lu Xiaobei's hand has been disabled.

582
00:26:26,362 --> 00:26:27,602
He won't be able to participate in the competition.

583
00:26:30,602 --> 00:26:32,322
What if Yinzhen is caught by them?

584
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:36,282
a row

585
00:26:50,562 --> 00:26:51,802
Injury of right hand tendon

586
00:26:52,122 --> 00:26:53,483
Fracture of right palm

587
00:26:53,483 --> 00:26:54,322
Prepare the anesthesia.

588
00:26:54,723 --> 00:26:56,003
We need to close it immediately.

589
00:27:00,003 --> 00:27:00,643
doctor

590
00:27:01,322 --> 00:27:02,362
Please hurry up.

591
00:27:02,963 --> 00:27:04,122
I have a competition tomorrow.

592
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:06,643
What time is it? You still want to compete?

593
00:27:06,643 --> 00:27:07,163
young man

594
00:27:07,683 --> 00:27:08,842
I must remind you that

595
00:27:09,042 --> 00:27:10,602
You must rest after the surgery.

596
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:12,443
If the wound reopens,

597
00:27:12,683 --> 00:27:14,122
Will affect the function of your fingers.

598
00:27:17,483 --> 00:27:17,963
Xiaobei

599
00:27:18,483 --> 00:27:19,483
Listen to the doctor's arrangement.

600
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:20,963
Tomorrow's competition

601
00:27:20,963 --> 00:27:22,483
With Cheng Hao and Xiangzi as replacements,

602
00:27:23,802 --> 00:27:24,923
To defeat him,

603
00:27:25,723 --> 00:27:27,042
Only once tomorrow.

604
00:28:34,122 --> 00:28:35,122
Go back to bed.

605
00:28:39,243 --> 00:28:40,243
I can't sleep at all.

606
00:28:40,643 --> 00:28:41,403
I'm going to find Xiao Bei.

607
00:28:44,763 --> 00:28:46,362
What did Brother Feng tell you before he left?

608
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:48,802
Stay in the hotel.

609
00:28:49,322 --> 00:28:49,842
You are not allowed to go anywhere.

610
00:28:49,842 --> 00:28:50,802
I can't sleep at all.

611
00:28:50,802 --> 00:28:52,042
When I think of Xiao Bei being injured,

612
00:28:52,042 --> 00:28:53,122
My brain is going to explode.

613
00:28:53,122 --> 00:28:53,802
I don't care.

614
00:28:54,443 --> 00:28:55,282
I don't care. I'm gonna go find him.

615
00:28:57,842 --> 00:28:59,082
You can't even see yourself, can you?

616
00:28:59,923 --> 00:29:01,003
Xiao Bei is like this now.

617
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,923
You're sad and you want revenge.

618
00:29:15,483 --> 00:29:16,403
Go back to sleep.

619
00:29:17,243 --> 00:29:17,842
Have a good rest.

620
00:29:20,042 --> 00:29:21,963
You might have to compete for Xiao Bei tomorrow.

621
00:29:25,322 --> 00:29:25,763
Haozi

622
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:26,483
It's all my fault.

623
00:29:27,602 --> 00:29:28,203
It's all my fault.

624
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:29,842
I'm a fool.

625
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:32,282
It's my fault. I pointed to the restaurant.

626
00:29:32,802 --> 00:29:33,842
If you want to go to the restaurant.

627
00:29:33,842 --> 00:29:34,963
Xiao Bei will be fine.

628
00:29:36,003 --> 00:29:37,203
We will continue to fight from Ning Jiang.

629
00:29:37,203 --> 00:29:38,522
It's not easy to reach now.

630
00:29:39,003 --> 00:29:40,163
At this point,

631
00:29:40,802 --> 00:29:41,602
What happened

632
00:29:42,203 --> 00:29:43,683
Xiao Bei is going to collapse.

633
00:29:43,683 --> 00:29:45,443
He's falling apart. Do you know?

634
00:29:45,723 --> 00:29:46,723
I feel that

635
00:29:47,003 --> 00:29:48,443
I am the sinner.

636
00:29:48,443 --> 00:29:49,963
Wang Kai, hit me.

637
00:29:49,963 --> 00:29:51,842
You hit me.

638
00:29:51,842 --> 00:29:52,522
Haozi

639
00:29:52,522 --> 00:29:53,163
Hit me.

640
00:29:53,163 --> 00:29:54,443
Hao Zi, calm down.

641
00:29:57,282 --> 00:29:58,282
It's not your fault.

642
00:30:00,082 --> 00:30:02,322
It's obvious that they came to Xiaobei.

643
00:30:05,243 --> 00:30:06,282
If you really want to do something,

644
00:30:07,443 --> 00:30:08,203
To stay strong.

645
00:30:09,122 --> 00:30:10,683
Go to the arena tomorrow.

646
00:30:13,403 --> 00:30:15,322
There's no Xiao Bei in the competition.

647
00:30:17,723 --> 00:30:19,562
You think we can beat TNT?

648
00:30:21,723 --> 00:30:22,362
I have no idea

649
00:30:23,282 --> 00:30:24,203
But I will fight hard.

650
00:30:42,122 --> 00:30:42,802
I can't sleep.

651
00:30:43,163 --> 00:30:43,882
I'll look for you for a while.

652
00:30:47,562 --> 00:30:48,842
In seven hours,

653
00:30:49,122 --> 00:30:50,203
TNT is coming soon.

654
00:30:51,763 --> 00:30:53,403
I wonder how Xiao Bei is doing.

655
00:30:53,802 --> 00:30:55,403
Captain, he will be fine.

656
00:30:55,882 --> 00:30:57,483
His leg has been injured for so many years.

657
00:30:58,203 --> 00:30:59,243
Can stand up.

658
00:31:00,243 --> 00:31:01,683
No matter how strong you are,

659
00:31:01,842 --> 00:31:03,443
It's not made of iron.

660
00:31:04,522 --> 00:31:06,923
I won't be able to handle it tomorrow.

661
00:31:09,602 --> 00:31:10,683
I used to think

662
00:31:11,562 --> 00:31:13,203
Lu Xiao Bei was lucky to beat me.

663
00:31:13,723 --> 00:31:14,802
Then I found that

664
00:31:15,643 --> 00:31:16,882
He didn't rely on talent.

665
00:31:17,602 --> 00:31:18,403
It's not technology.

666
00:31:19,203 --> 00:31:20,802
It's his unconvinced energy.

667
00:31:21,522 --> 00:31:23,003
You can beat him in the competition.

668
00:31:25,122 --> 00:31:26,643
But I can't defeat him.

669
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:33,483
Whether the captain can play or not tomorrow,

670
00:31:35,003 --> 00:31:36,403
I will beat the Japanese team.

671
00:31:37,602 --> 00:31:38,483
To avenge him.

672
00:31:56,683 --> 00:31:58,243
Xiao Bei, you're awake.

673
00:32:08,122 --> 00:32:09,003
What did the doctor say?

674
00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:11,443
The doctor said the operation was successful.

675
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:13,562
But you just passed out.

676
00:32:14,203 --> 00:32:15,282
How are you feeling now?

677
00:32:19,963 --> 00:32:21,042
In addition to the pain,

678
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:25,403
Take the painkiller first.

679
00:32:25,403 --> 00:32:26,362
Feel better.

680
00:32:41,483 --> 00:32:42,443
The doctor also said

681
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,003
That you're so strong.

682
00:32:45,443 --> 00:32:46,403
You're so kind.

683
00:32:50,282 --> 00:32:51,443
The doctor said

684
00:32:51,723 --> 00:32:52,602
Where are your hands?

685
00:32:52,602 --> 00:32:53,562
As long as you keep it well,

686
00:32:53,882 --> 00:32:55,243
It will recover in less than two months.

687
00:32:58,963 --> 00:32:59,802
Two months.

688
00:33:05,403 --> 00:33:06,362
Take it as

689
00:33:06,522 --> 00:33:08,282
Take a vacation.

690
00:33:11,042 --> 00:33:11,842
What time is it now?

691
00:33:17,403 --> 00:33:18,082
Half past six.

692
00:33:20,842 --> 00:33:21,723
When the competition begins,

693
00:33:23,483 --> 00:33:24,562
There are three hours left.

694
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:26,282
Don't worry about the competition.

695
00:33:26,522 --> 00:33:27,683
With Feng and Mr. An,

696
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:28,483
I'll leave it to them.

697
00:33:28,483 --> 00:33:29,163
Chu song

698
00:33:31,683 --> 00:33:32,322
You know that.

699
00:33:34,483 --> 00:33:36,163
I have to go to this game.

700
00:33:36,163 --> 00:33:37,443
You can't go.

701
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:38,763
The doctor said

702
00:33:38,763 --> 00:33:40,643
If you stretch it, you'll be doomed.

703
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:41,443
If it's serious,

704
00:33:43,763 --> 00:33:44,282
If it's serious,

705
00:33:44,282 --> 00:33:45,723
You'll never play again.

706
00:33:54,483 --> 00:33:55,122
Chu song

707
00:33:56,923 --> 00:33:57,443
What's up

708
00:33:58,362 --> 00:33:59,923
You know the first time I noticed you,

709
00:34:01,522 --> 00:34:02,602
When is it?

710
00:34:04,003 --> 00:34:04,923
On the first day of transfer,

711
00:34:07,243 --> 00:34:08,322
It's you.

712
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,562
On the day of the track team tryouts,

713
00:34:15,362 --> 00:34:16,483
Your cleats are broken.

714
00:34:20,282 --> 00:34:21,562
But you didn't give up.

715
00:34:25,042 --> 00:34:26,082
You ran barefoot.

716
00:34:26,802 --> 00:34:28,163
You still won the first place.

717
00:34:34,882 --> 00:34:36,522
I don't want to be on the track yet.

718
00:34:38,082 --> 00:34:39,163
And give up early.

719
00:34:44,122 --> 00:34:45,362
To fight for a breath.

720
00:34:46,882 --> 00:34:47,842
To bet your future.

721
00:34:51,282 --> 00:34:51,882
unworthy

722
00:35:07,282 --> 00:35:08,443
good

723
00:35:08,763 --> 00:35:09,483
Okay, Brother Feng.

724
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:10,003
OK!

725
00:35:11,282 --> 00:35:12,763
Let Xiao Bei rest more.

726
00:35:13,163 --> 00:35:14,122
See you at the scene.

727
00:35:15,082 --> 00:35:16,203
I know.

728
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:17,282
Bye

729
00:35:22,082 --> 00:35:23,243
Xiao Bei is done with the surgery.

730
00:35:23,403 --> 00:35:24,163
It went well.

731
00:35:24,362 --> 00:35:25,163
Now he's asleep.

732
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:31,003
Let's go.

733
00:35:35,923 --> 00:35:38,963
Welcome back to 2011.

Let the battle begin.

Welcome to the Singapore Sports Center.

Where are you?

746
00:36:16,122 --> 00:36:17,443
The game is about to begin.

747
00:36:20,082 --> 00:36:21,882
Show the speed of charging.

748
00:36:22,243 --> 00:36:23,483
The last one to arrive will buy a drink.

749
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,123
Okay, ladies and gentlemen.

750
00:36:26,123 --> 00:36:28,203

Just now, we received news that

753
00:36:33,643 --> 00:36:35,442
Go on, captain North.

754
00:36:35,442 --> 00:36:36,603
Due to physical reasons,

755
00:36:36,603 --> 00:36:39,043
I may not be able to participate in the competition today.

756
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:47,442
Okay, let's introduce the members of the Continuing Team.

757
00:36:51,802 --> 00:36:55,523
They will play against the Japanese TNT team.

A ticket to the finals.

00:37:12,203 --> 00:37:14,123
Who can get the ticket?

767
00:37:14,402 --> 00:37:16,002
Let's wait and see.

768
00:37:16,643 --> 00:37:18,643
Please stand down and get ready.

I just got the news.

00:37:49,123 --> 00:37:50,203
Caught that man last night.

Has been officially summoned.

773
00:37:52,643 --> 00:37:54,282
If he can tell us who is behind it,

774
00:37:54,282 --> 00:37:55,643
Has something to do with the Japanese team.

775
00:37:56,163 --> 00:37:58,243
We can appeal to the competition committee.

776
00:38:01,842 --> 00:38:03,442
Let's win the game first.

777
00:38:15,962 --> 00:38:17,163
What do you want to do?

778
00:38:19,203 --> 00:38:20,643
Don't worry. Just do it boldly.
