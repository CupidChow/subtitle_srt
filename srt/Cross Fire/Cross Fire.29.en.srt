1
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,639
Wang Kai can do it.

2
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,519
I didn't expect you to be stubborn.

3
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,199
I really want Xiao Bei to train a swift horse.

4
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,199
The hero saved the beauty in time.

5
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:15,679
S+1

6
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:17,640
A sure thing.

7
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,960
I lost it several times.

8
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:20,760
Don't you feel anything today?

9
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,199
sorry

10
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,440
It was my fault.

11
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:24,960
Xiaobei

12
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,839
I'll fill her seat.

13
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:28,320
Go fill her seat.

14
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,519
What if there's someone missing in the middle road?

15
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,039
Then I'll go to the middle.

16
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,039
It won't cause much trouble.

17
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:32,679
Why are you so nervous?

18
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,320
WangKai

19
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:34,920
I don't need your help.

20
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:36,560
You need to be protected.

21
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,520
Where are you going?

22
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,439
Dinner will be ready soon.

23
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,880
I'm going out to do something.

24
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:58,880
Be right back.

25
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,000
At 9: 30, he was running a map.

26
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,320
I'll be back soon.

27
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:13,560
It's easy to teach others a lesson.

28
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,319
I'm leaving.

29
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,920
The captain is different.

30
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,799
You have the privilege.

31
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,760
Alright.

32
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,239
Xiao Bei has something important.

33
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,280
What's important?

34
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,799
Is to see President Huo.

35
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,480
Eating and drinking all day long.

36
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,400
Did I bring you?

37
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:27,040
Did I bring you?

38
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,920
Did I bring you?

39
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,319
belt

40
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,879
Susu

41
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,000
Are you all right?

42
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:12,879
I'm fine.

43
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,360
I'll get you some water.

44
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:33,960
Boss

45
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,240
Xiaobei

46
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:36,719
This is our technical director.

47
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,159
I don't understand the technology.

48
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,159
Let them talk to you.

49
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:40,439
Hello

50
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:41,639
I'm Lu Xiao Bei.

51
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,000
Have you made any progress?

52
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,560
We contacted Xiao Feng's previous experience

53
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,599
This game company

54
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:47,439
They told us

55
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,840
The data has been completely erased.

56
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,759
But as far as we know,

57
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:51,560
Actually, every company

58
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,800
To protect your data,

59
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,400
There's always a backup in the cloud.

60
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,639
What are you saying?

61
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,080
We still have a chance to find Xiao Feng.

62
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,919
The data of that year

63
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,360
But the premise is that

64
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,599
You must have this cloud tracker.

65
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:02,960
It's like a GPS.

66
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,280
Can help us quickly in the cloud.

67
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,120
Find the location.

68
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,719
This is

69
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,520
The cloud tracker he mentioned

70
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,120
Brother,

71
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,400
How did you get it?

72
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:20,039
And gave them an offer they couldn't refuse.

73
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:20,560
Price

74
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,199
You're so powerful.

75
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,199
come

76
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,080
We can have a look.

77
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,639
This is our cloud data.

78
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,719
We can be in here.

79
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,400
Find Xiao Feng's consciousness?

80
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,360
Now we see the picture of the game.

81
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:43,960
But we haven't found

82
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,520
The entrance of specific data

83
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,800
How long will it take to open the entrance?

84
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:49,719
We need more time.

85
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:50,639
We're still trying.

86
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,959
son

87
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:44,079
Let's eat.

88
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,639
son

89
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:52,399
dad

90
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,439
This is your mom's favorite noodles.

91
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,360
Hurry up and eat.

92
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,519
The 9287th game failed.

93
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:27,439
The game data will be reset.

94
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,079
Please be prepared.

95
00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:32,879
And start the challenge again.

96
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,040
Why haven't you gone back to school?

97
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,199
What are you doing?

98
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:55,360
I went out to do something.

99
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:56,399
what?

100
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,240
Your tone now

101
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,480
When my dad interrogated me,

102
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,319
Don't change the topic.

103
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:02,319
Answer me.

104
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,360
I went out for some personal business.

105
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,519
Did you go to Mr. Huo's office?

106
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,639
How do you know?

107
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,759
When we were friends,

108
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,959
You told me everything.

109
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:20,800
But I think I'll be the leader

110
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:22,560
Instead, we have a distance.

111
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,360
I don't like this feeling.

112
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:28,040
I have my own privacy.

113
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,439
good

114
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,440
Have a good rest.

115
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,279
Don't be angry.

116
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,279
That's right.

117
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:41,519
I'm just angry.

118
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,360
You haven't thought about

119
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,039
In the training.

120
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,200
Then won't you give up

121
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:48,679
So I'm done.

122
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,320
I'm warning you.

123
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,360
Then you underestimated me.

124
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:56,639
I'll keep an eye on you.

125
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,039
Train hard in the future.

126
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,960
It's so late. I'll give you a taxi.

127
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,279
No, I'm running back.

128
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:08,159
Send me a WeChat when you get home.

129
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
That's impossible.

130
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,200
I'm always on time.

131
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,000
Why is it half a month?

132
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:47,639
Miss, what are you looking for?

133
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,519
Is there a pregnancy test?

134
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:53,600
home pregnancy test kit

135
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:54,600
Yes

136
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,720
Which one do you want?

137
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,200
casual

138
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,399
We don't do this here.

139
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,159
The best kind.

140
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,039
68

141
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,919
Pay the bill here.

142
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,399
Miss, you didn't take the pregnancy test.

143
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,200
Is this one bar or two bars?

144
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,480
What do you mean negative and positive?

145
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,879
What is that?

146
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:32,679
Susu

147
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,159
What happened to you these days?

148
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,200
What's wrong?

149
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:35,960
Nothing

150
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,000
It's okay. You didn't reply to my WeChat.

151
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,399
You only know to send me WeChat when you're free.

152
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:40,360
Why should I answer you?

153
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:42,639
That's it.

154
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,159
I'm not doing anything today.

155
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,240
I'll stay with you.

156
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:45,960
all right?

157
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,399
No need

158
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:48,320
It's too late.

159
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,440
Look at you.

160
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,879
Don't worry.

161
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,559
No matter what happened that day,

162
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:53,919
I will be responsible for you.

163
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,519
I don't need you to be responsible for me.

164
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,000
Did you consider my feelings?

165
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,559
Can't you see I'm in a hurry?

166
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:02,840
I don't have time to think about you.

167
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,559
I'm your boyfriend.

168
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,080
Love is not casual.

169
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,360
Don't worry, you're not pregnant.

170
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,720
You scared me to death.

171
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,159
You may have been stressed out

172
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,559
The menstrual cycle is somewhat irregular.

173
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,799
What's your job?

174
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,559
Professional e-sports player.

175
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,799
I see. How about this?

176
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,080
To take a brain computer tomography.

177
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,440
Brain computed tomography

178
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,000
Why did I shoot that?

179
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,240
Your current situation

180
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,919
May be more serious than pregnancy.

181
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,440
According to the inspection report,

182
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,600
In addition to the myosingitis and cervical hyperplasia,

183
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,080
You also have a serious spontaneous pneumo.

184
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,120
The symptoms are caused by prolonged sitting.

185
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,080
And mental stress.

186
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,679
Caused the lung collapse.

187
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,960
Leading to impaired breathing.

188
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,720
Could be life-threatening.

189
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,559
The nerves of the brain will suffer

190
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:49,279
Causing damage.

191
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,720
To what extent?

192
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,960
I need to see the film.

193
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:54,720
Don't scare me.

194
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,799
It's not that exaggerated.

195
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,759
Everyone in our team is the same as me.

196
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:58,879
Every day,

197
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:00,600
And a lot more tired than me.

198
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:02,519
How could this happen to me?

199
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,600
There's a big difference between men and women.

200
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,559
Staying up late to train is too heavy for women.

201
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:11,159
I'll prescribe some endocrine drugs for you.

202
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:12,200
Eat on time.

203
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,240
Within three days,

204
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,799
I guess I can get my period.

205
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:16,360
No way

206
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:18,240
I have a game on Thursday.

207
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,360
You still want to compete?

208
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,159
You should put down all the things

209
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,279
Work related to it.

210
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,039
impossible

211
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,480
The competition is more important to me.

212
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,879
Think it over.

213
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,559
You're a girl.

214
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:30,799
If you keep fooling around like this,

215
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,960
My health will collapse sooner or later.

216
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,120
Why are you here again?

217
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,200
Do you have birth control pills?

218
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:58,559
You bought a pregnancy test and birth control pills.

219
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,360
Are you selling it or not?

220
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,440
What kind do you want?

221
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,960
The kind that can delay your period.

222
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,279
When did you come?

223
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:19,159
Why didn't you call me?

224
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,559
Did you stay up for another night?

225
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,519
Are you tired?

226
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,399
I'm not tired.

227
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,159
You drank so many drinks.

228
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,480
otherwise

229
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,960
I'll get you a cup of milk.

230
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,480
I'll cook a bowl of noodles for you.

231
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,639
No need.

232
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,960
I'm doing it for your own good.

233
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,480
Why don't you take some hot food?

234
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,159
Staying up too late is bad for your health.

235
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,240
How about you go to bed after this round?

236
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:50,799
Why do you care about me?

237
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,919
Didn't you say that?

238
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,080
We broke up.

239
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,519
You said you were free.

240
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,639
Right? I'm free.

241
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:00,200
WangKai

242
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,600
I've come to coax you.

243
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,519
Don't push your luck.

244
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:06,960
How did I bully others?

245
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,200
I asked you to handle it.

246
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,279
You've said everything.

247
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:12,879
good

248
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:14,080
You just want to

249
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,440
To break up with her, right?

250
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,440
Keep playing your game.

251
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,240
If you want to break up, just say it.

252
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,559
From the beginning,

253
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:22,320
Was a mistake.

254
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:25,519
I

255
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,120
I also think

256
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,840
WangKai

257
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,360
Do I know you?

258
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,320
My name is Liang Bingjie.

259
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:51,919
The manager of Gravity Team.

260
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,559
What's the matter

261
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:57,279
Are you going back to the team?

262
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,279
I'll send you back.

263
00:17:58,679 --> 00:17:59,879
I have something to tell you.

264
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,679
Get in the car.

265
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,159
spit it out!

266
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,320
spit it out!

267
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,240
I've watched your matches recently.

268
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,320
I'm surprised by your progress.

269
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,080
Go back and tell your teammates.

270
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,000
Be prepared to be attacked by me.

271
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,840
To be honest,

272
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,120
The current gravity is similar to your team.

273
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,240
I can't say I'm 100 percent sure.

274
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,559
Everyone knew that

275
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,519
As long as I pinch Lu Xiao Bei,

276
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,000
You can limit your attacks by more than half.

277
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,120
Now with you,

278
00:18:33,399 --> 00:18:35,000
Go on. The team has been reactivated.

279
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:37,440
Want to hear it.

280
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,159
What do the other teams think of you?

281
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,159
No need.

282
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,799
I never care what others think of me.

283
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:45,200
Just right

284
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,279
They don't have much opinion on you.

285
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:49,799
Everyone thought it was Lu Xiao Bei.

286
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,200
To make way for the main attack.

287
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,240
That's why you got your grades.

288
00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:55,000
Is his magnanimity.

289
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,759
And trained you.

290
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,159
Are they blind?

291
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:00,480
Of course I know your capabilities.

292
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,039
But in your team,

293
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:04,679
No matter what kind of achievement,

294
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,480
Everyone will say that Lu Xiao Bei did it.

295
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,519
No matter how good you are,

296
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:09,879
Is always in the hands of Lu Xiao Bei.

297
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:10,919
It's just a card.

298
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,600
Xiao Bei and I are very close.

299
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,679
I don't need you to stir up trouble.

300
00:19:14,639 --> 00:19:16,200
I didn't mean to drive a wedge between you two.

301
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,159
I know you always wanted to...

302
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:18,080
Go beyond Lu Xiao Bei.

303
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,120
in fact

304
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,399
You have the ability.

305
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,320
But you stay with him.

306
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,759
All the lights on you

307
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,559
Will only be a part of his halo.

308
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,000
If that's the case, you're willing to...

309
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:33,679
What are you trying to say

310
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:35,960
I want to give you a better stage.

311
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:37,360
Let's do gravity.

312
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,039
President Xu appreciates you.

313
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,159
He said you and King could make up

314
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:42,919
The strongest Wang Fried combination in the league.

315
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,720
What King can have.

316
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,679
You won't lose anything.

317
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,159
to undermine

318
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,679
You're late.

319
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,840
But it must be the best for you.

320
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,320
Unless you want to.

321
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,960
Living in the shadow of others.

322
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,320
And never want to stand out.

323
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,200
The opponent today is

324
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,279
The battle team and the victory team.

325
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:02,559
Then, as a team,

326
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,319
For the team that just became more famous,

327
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:05,720
It's also the first time

328
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,200
A professional league that crosses the line of fire.

329
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,640
The Victory Team

330
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,079
Just finished his two-game winning streak.

331
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:12,119
At the same time, the condition is being maintained.

332
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:13,039
We need to slow down the pace.

333
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,799
Wang Kai S + 1, seal the smoke under the bridge.

334
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,480
Seal the smoke.

335
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,000
Big A is here.

336
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,960
A, Big Boss!

337
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,839
I'm being flashed.

338
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,200
S+1

339
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,039
Copy that.

340
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:30,000
Big A is here.

341
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:30,640
Received, received.

342
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,480
A is gone.

343
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,279
I'll fill the seat.

344
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:32,720
Beautiful.

345
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,720
Su Jiayi, fill the gun.

346
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,359
Su Jiayi.

347
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:42,319
To replace Su Jiayi.

348
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:43,119
Su Jiayi, fill the gun.

349
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:44,440
Su Jiayi.

350
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,240
S+1

351
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,039
Su Jiayi, Su

352
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:47,640
doctor

353
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:48,839
Su Jiayi.

354
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,000
Su Jiayi.

355
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,680
doctor

356
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,720
Pause.

357
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,200
doctor

358
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,880
Doctor, where are you?

359
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,880
Whose bag is it?

360
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,880
Which player is it?

361
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,720
Open it and have a look.

362
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,079
There should be his admission card inside.

363
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:17,480
Su Jiayi.

364
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,880
We're here.

365
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,559
What about

366
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,920
Are you feeling better?

367
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,440
It's okay. I'm fine.

368
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,319
Little sister, we're here to see you.

369
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:37,680
So many people came to see me.

370
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,720
Lie down and have a good rest.

371
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:40,880
I'm fine.

372
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,960
She fainted because of hypoglycemia.

373
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,279
I made you worry.

374
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,319
The doctor has told us

375
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,519
Your health is poor.

376
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:52,559
If we didn't get to the hospital in time,

377
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,039
It might cause bigger problems.

378
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:54,920
Susu

379
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,079
I'm your boyfriend.

380
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,599
Why didn't you tell me about this?

381
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,720
I'm an adult.

382
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,599
I can take care of myself.

383
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,400
You can take care of yourself.

384
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,720
Then why should I?

385
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,839
You're an adult.

386
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:09,359
Don't take the medicine you should take.

387
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:10,480
The medicine you shouldn't take.

388
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,880
What are you talking about?

389
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,960
What are you talking about?

390
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,880
What did I take?

391
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,880
What did you take?

392
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,559
Birth control pills

393
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:16,720
Why are you eating that?

394
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,279
It has nothing to do with you.

395
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,039
good

396
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,000
Wang Kai, where are you going? What are you doing?

397
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:37,200
Calm down.

398
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,839
Take that medicine.

399
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:40,279
To avoid her period.

400
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:41,240
Play well.

401
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:45,200
We are teammates.

402
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:46,799
What's your problem?

403
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:47,720
You can tell us.

404
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,039
This is my own business.

405
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,000
I don't want to tell you.

406
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:54,799
Su Jiayi.

407
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,680
At the end of the game today,

408
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,680
You left your bag in the gym.

409
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,279
Someone went through the bag.

410
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,240
I found the medicine.

411
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,599
And post it online.

412
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:08,119
Now?

413
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,759
The discussion on the Internet is very high.

414
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,440
You can choose not to look at it.

415
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:40,200
Don't read it.

416
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,759
Or

417
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:43,400
Let's give a formal response on official WeChat.

418
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,119
Don't respond.

419
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,039
This kind of thing will only make it worse.

420
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,559
The white one is white.

421
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,359
You didn't do anything wrong.

422
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,039
It's the keyboard warriors that are wrong.

423
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,359
Yes

424
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,200
You didn't do anything wrong.

425
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,400
Su Jiayi.

426
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,640
Compared to my teammates,

427
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:00,160
I think we're more like your family.

428
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:01,920
From now on,

429
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,559
You should pay more attention to your body.

430
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:08,000
We will always be your most solid backing.

431
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:48,880
Let's eat.

432
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,119
Let's eat.

433
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,559
Sure.

434
00:25:58,319 --> 00:25:59,960
Su Jiayi, seriously,

435
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:01,599
Without you nagging me,

436
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:03,160
I've been eating delicious food.

437
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,680
I slept so well.

438
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,240
Even the cactus on the windowsill has bloomed.

439
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,119
Come on.

440
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:10,000
You don't know.

441
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,039
When you were away,

442
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,839
He talks about you at least 50 times a day.

443
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,799
Seriously?

444
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:14,880
What is he talking about?

445
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,799
I'm talking about such a powerful character.

446
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,240
In the future, I will check which team is not good with you.

447
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,119
Take the big horn

448
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,400
And sent it to the people.

449
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,079
right or wrong?

450
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:23,039
Let me tell you something.

451
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:24,279
I want you to talk a lot.

452
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:25,200
pretty

453
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,279
I'm leaving the team.

454
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:27,480
The women's doubles

455
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,000
Are you scared?

456
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,279
You finally got sick.

457
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,319
You're so feminine.

458
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,440
I beg you to take it easy.

459
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,839
Don't recover so fast, okay?

460
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:36,440
WangKai

461
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,359
What were you talking about?

462
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,319
I'm leaving the team.

463
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,160
Where are you going when you leave the team?

464
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:45,559
gravitation

465
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:46,920
Wang Kai, are you crazy?

466
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,759
Or are you out of your mind?

467
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:48,559
What are you talking about?

468
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:49,599
I'm calm now.

469
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,880
I know I'm here.

470
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,000
There's no big development.

471
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Only by gravity,

472
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,160
So I can win the championship.

473
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:56,079
Xiaobei

474
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:57,680
Didn't you say that

475
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,279
To make me a new Wang Kai?

476
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,119
I'll listen to you.

477
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,200
What condition does gravity give you?

478
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,160
I have all that King has.

479
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,119
WangKai

480
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:11,079
Gravity is our biggest enemy now.

481
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,160
You betrayed the enemy, you know?

482
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,119
There will be many enemies in the future.

483
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:16,279
traitor

484
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:17,680
Don't say that.

485
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,119
What traitor? No traitor.

486
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:20,319
We are professionals.

487
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:21,279
The transfer is normal.

488
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,759
And there's no rule that

489
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:23,920
You must be loyal.

490
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,400
Su Jiayi.

491
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,359
You can find someone to cooperate with you.

492
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,599
Leave now.

493
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,240
I don't care about you at all.

494
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,279
good

495
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,440
I'll satisfy you.

496
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:59,119
WangKai

497
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:00,319
Let him go.

498
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,359
You just

499
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,279
Why didn't you persuade him to stay?

500
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,680
He has made a decision.

501
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:36,319
No one can stop it.

502
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,319
Maybe this is life.

503
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:42,119
No one can accompany who to the end.

504
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:44,720
There's always someone

505
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,200
And dropped out.

506
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,880
Leave early.

507
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,759
But no matter what happens,

508
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,039
We all have to force ourselves to move on.

509
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:55,480
I know you're upset.

510
00:28:58,359 --> 00:28:59,400
with great difficulty

511
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,599
And trained Wang Kai.

512
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,240
But became an opponent.

513
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,480
Su Jiayi is ill again.

514
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:05,799
Not to mention the promotion.

515
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,440
Now the five players

516
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:10,039
There's no way to get it together.

517
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,400
Gravity has a substitute.

518
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,160
Xiangzi.

519
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,640
We can get him here.

520
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,400
I know him.

521
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,279
He hasn't played a formal match.

522
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,920
So our opponent

523
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,880
So I didn't have the chance to study his methods.

524
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,480
but

525
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,359
The current situation of the team

526
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:26,720
Are you sure he wants to come?

527
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,920
Just tell me.

528
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:31,480
Lu Xiao Bei invited him.

529
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:37,440
We will be a family from now on.

530
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,960
don't mention it

531
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:40,519
Except me here,

532
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:42,000
You have the highest clearance.

533
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,079
Take a look.

534
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:56,039
This is a holographic cabin chair imported from Japan.

535
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:57,599
This is expensive, right?

536
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:58,839
It's very valuable.

537
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,000
It can help you find the best way to play.

538
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,279
To improve the training level.

539
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:04,200
To challenge your limit state.

540
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,400
This is our public recreation area.

541
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,400
That's the restaurant.

542
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,400
We have professional dietitians.

543
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,000
To feed every athlete.

544
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:17,559
This is our star member.

545
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:19,680
When we win the championship this year,

546
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,440
Your photo is also here.

547
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,720
What is this?

548
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,359
This is also imported from Japan.

549
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:40,200
Physical sign data monitor

550
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,160
It can detect the players.

551
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,319
Heart rate at different states of the race

552
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:44,759
Brain waveform skin moisture

553
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,359
And the speed of muscle response.

554
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,240
What about

555
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:52,799
What kind of treatment does King get?

556
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:53,759
to feel relieved

557
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:54,799
You too.

558
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,920
One in the middle.

559
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:09,839
pretty

560
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:11,720
One is missing.

561
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,599
There are two more.

562
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:13,559
One at home.

563
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:14,440
I've seen it.

564
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:16,279
to wait a moment

565
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,759
I see him. I saw him.

566
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:19,279
I'm charging forward.

567
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,119
Throw it away.

568
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:20,880
It's white.

569
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,720
Go on.

570
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,480
It's gone.

571
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,960
pretty

572
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,079
Let me introduce to you

573
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,400
This is our new member.

574
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,759
Let's get to know each other.

575
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:32,720
Hello, everyone.

576
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,279
My name is Li Jiaxiang.

577
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:36,160
You can call me Xiangzi.

578
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:46,039
You're welcome.

579
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,400
You're bold.

580
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:51,799
You're really here.

581
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:56,680
I can prove it.

582
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,119
I heard Lu Xiao Bei before the game.

583
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:00,000
To discuss with him.

584
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,119
When you compete,

585
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:02,279
Thank you, too.

586
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,039
To give me such a chance.

587
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,759
I'm sorry to you.

588
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,519
Xiaobei

589
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,279
sorry

590
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,599
Please don't.

591
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,000
I thought

592
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,240
You're a little bad.

593
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,200
It's late today.

594
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:20,960
Get familiar with the environment.

595
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:22,400
We will practice together tomorrow.

596
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:23,599
good

597
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,880
It's your first time to meet.

598
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,880
Point out any shortcomings.

599
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,400
Let me add you on WeChat.

600
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,319
I will sweep you.

601
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,400
I'm busy.

602
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,920
Join the group later.

603
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:39,799
I'll help you.

604
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:41,799
Let's train.

605
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:46,519
Okay, I'll take a look at everyone here.

606
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,319
Xiao Bei sealed the thunder.

607
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:56,319
It's sealed.

608
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,400
Don't worry.

609
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,680
We're short.

610
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,920
Alright.

611
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,759
I went there from A.

612
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,799
Take a look at A.

613
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:03,759
I'm at A, I'm at A.

614
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,279
I'm coming.

615
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:05,920
Go from A dog.

616
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,680
Alright.

617
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,680
I dropped it.

618
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:09,400
I want you to look at the back of your ass.

619
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:11,319
It's all right.

620
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:12,279
There are two more.

621
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:15,160
Keep an eye on me.

622
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,640
Has he ever played a formal match?

623
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,039
Who hasn't even played a formal match.

624
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:25,160
Can you fight with us?

625
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:27,440
Aren't we from the bench?

626
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,440
Can it be the same?

627
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,519
He looks like a bitter gourd.

628
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,240
Don't you think

629
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,240
Are you actually similar?

630
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,160
Are you shortsighted?

631
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,920
If you try to hack me again,

632
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,559
I just...

633
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,200
I won't talk to you.

634
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,920
Watch the bridge.

635
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:51,359
There are two more.

636
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,920
A is the last one.

637
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,680
Beautiful.

638
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,720
Is still in Grade A.

639
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,440
Big A dropped the last one.

640
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,839
pretty

641
00:33:58,839 --> 00:33:59,640
Alright.

642
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:03,599
What have you been remembering?

643
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:06,920
Nothing

644
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:09,839
Every time I see you under the bridge,

645
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:10,759
After the killing,

646
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:12,759
Will jump to the left.

647
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:14,240
After that,

648
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,599
When we cooperate with each other,

649
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,279
I can cover the right side for you.

650
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:19,279
How do you know I always jump?

651
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,319
Every professional

652
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,519
Will have his own.

653
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:23,480
A habit.

654
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:26,799
Take the six meters under the bridge.

655
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:27,680
The way everyone passes,

656
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,440
Are different.

657
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,720
FLY at the top of the Forbidden City.

658
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,160
He used to pass in four steps.

659
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,279
It's easy to make mistakes.

660
00:34:34,279 --> 00:34:35,400
Old K of the Victory Team.

661
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,599
He's more cautious.

662
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,559
He often uses five steps or five and a half steps.

663
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:39,880
Take the left one.

664
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,400
It's good for him to do that.

665
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,839
You're used to four steps.

666
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:44,599
it doesn't matter

667
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:45,680
I'll take care of you in the future.

668
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:52,640
this

669
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,799
It's just everyone's personal habit.

670
00:34:54,799 --> 00:34:55,319
I'm here.

671
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:57,680
And the advantage map of each team.

672
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,799
And the analysis of inferior maps.

673
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:00,240
And personal data analysis.

674
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:00,680
Young man, you can do it.

675
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,359
And every one of them.

676
00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:03,720
Used to play.

677
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,480
Advantages and disadvantages

678
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,319
And the specific method.

679
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:07,160
When you're on stage,

680
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,200
And have nothing to do.

681
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,559
Maybe I just remember to be more specific.

682
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:12,839
Super brain.

683
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:13,599
That's amazing.

684
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,279
Trust me.

685
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:16,680
Xiangzi.

686
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,519
I've made all the preparations.

687
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,920
I can't get through to you.

688
00:35:39,319 --> 00:35:40,400
We're all worried about you.

689
00:35:41,759 --> 00:35:42,599
I turned off my phone.

690
00:35:43,759 --> 00:35:45,400
Who never leaves his phone.

691
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,480
Can you turn off the phone?

692
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,599
The internet is full of abuse.

693
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,240
Even the fans in the studio went dark.

694
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:54,319
Turn off the phone. Be quiet.

695
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:57,960
I used to

696
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,200
As the most important part of my life.

697
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:01,839
Unexpectedly,

698
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,599
It hurt me the most.

699
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,799
This is the first time that I think

700
00:36:06,799 --> 00:36:07,960
You're so close to me.

701
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:09,640
You're so cruel.

702
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,799
Some people are full.

703
00:36:11,799 --> 00:36:12,480
Don't bother them.

704
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:15,359
It's okay to scold me.

705
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:17,359
I don't want to drag you down.

706
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:21,319
We're really fine.

707
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,279
Come on.

708
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,200
Look what I brought you.

709
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,960
These are Xiao Bei's

710
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,599
I bought you your favorite snacks.

711
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,039
This is the mask I brought for you.

712
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:36,160
You can have a try.

713
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,519
Correct!

714
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,920
Recently,

715
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,079
Did you contact Wang Kai?

716
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:50,880
It's dark.

717
00:36:51,799 --> 00:36:53,599
Is probably the best ending for us.

718
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,960
Actually, after I was angry,

719
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,480
I can understand him.

720
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,759
Understanding is one thing.

721
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,880
Identification is another thing.

722
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,599
I found that

723
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:08,679
When I accept this,

724
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:10,199
You don't care so much anymore.

725
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:12,320
Leave him alone.

726
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,000
I haven't solved a lot of troubles.

727
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,800
Back in the sports team,

728
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,960
There are more boys than girls.

729
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:23,239
I always force myself to compete with boys.

730
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,719
Because they said

731
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:26,599
Girls can't run faster than boys.

732
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,000
Because everyone thought

733
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,079
Girls can't do that.

734
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,559
That's why I have to do better.

735
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,400
I'm the only child left in the league.

736
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,599
If I fail,

737
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,760
No one will be able to

738
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,079
You're willing to trust a female player.

739
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,480
That's what I thought.

740
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,239
I must run faster than the boys.

741
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,880
But no matter how hard I try,

742
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:50,519
Can't make up the congenital gap.

743
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:54,039
You know what?

744
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,360
The women's 100m world record.

745
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:57,920
It's Joyner's 11.49 seconds.

746
00:37:58,519 --> 00:37:59,519
For more than 30 years.

747
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,840
No one can break it.

748
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:03,840
可是大学生运动会

749
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,239
Any male player

750
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:06,800
You can even improve your performance.

751
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,760
This is the gap.

752
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,079
So then my coach told me

753
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,519
What you want to surpass

754
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:13,559
Is my current self.

755
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,599
Instead of the boy next door.

756
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,000
I finally understand.

757
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,960
So I spent all my time and energy

758
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,360
All spent on fighting.

759
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:26,000
Instead, I forgot myself.

760
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,599
What are you good at?

761
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,199
Actually, the female player

762
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:32,440
Has its own advantages.

763
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,920
If you want to keep fighting,

764
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,159
Don't forget to use your strengths.

765
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:36,920
Don't use your shortcomings

766
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,199
To compete with others' strengths.

767
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:39,719
Don't forget that

768
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:41,440
Crossing the fire is a team project.

769
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,400
What you want to defeat

770
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,280
Is your opponent.

771
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:44,559
Not a teammate.

772
00:38:57,679 --> 00:38:58,239
Su Jiayi.

773
00:38:59,159 --> 00:38:59,639
Come on

774
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:01,239
Su Jiayi.

775
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:01,920
Come on

776
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:02,719
Su Jiayi.

777
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:03,760
Come on

778
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,400
Su Jiayi.

779
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:08,239
Come on

780
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,639
After the transfer gravity,

781
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:37,920
The combination of Wang Kai and King

782
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,280
Has become the best player

783
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,239
An open existence.

784
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:41,599
For their Gravity Team,

785
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:42,320
And won the championship.

786
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,679
No one will doubt it.

787
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:45,159
But what everyone is concerned about

788
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:46,639
You mean the Gravity Team.

789
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:47,840
In the final victory,

790
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,400
How many professional leagues can we renovate?

791
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,719
A new record in history.

792
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:53,400
Yes, this is what we all look forward to.

793
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,039
Yes

794
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,000
hello

795
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,960
Love you.

796
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,519
Did you miss me?

797
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:25,400
Love you.

798
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,159
Xiaobei

799
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:49,800
Why hasn't Chuge come yet?

800
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,400
She can't come to class today.

801
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,880
Then you can't see her.

802
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,519
Wearing a swimsuit.

803
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:58,480
Fortunately, she didn't come.

804
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,119
It's okay.

805
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,760
I'm sending Chuge a WeChat message.

806
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:07,199
Gravity won again.

807
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:08,360
Ten victories in a row.

808
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:09,639
How do I do it next?

809
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:11,880
How to fight.

810
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,079
Just now,

811
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:14,079
Yes

812
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,039
Just now,

813
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:17,000
Teach the traitor a lesson.

814
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,800
tomorrow

815
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:22,320
You won't show mercy, right?

816
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:24,760
His head.

817
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,960
Don't fight with me.

818
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,480
Correct!

819
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,159
Now Weibo is doing a poll.

820
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:31,440
Which team do you support?

821
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,760
378 votes were cast.

822
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,800
Three hundred and seventy-six voted for them.

823
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,840
We still have two fans.

824
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:42,239
We voted for those two tickets.

825
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,800
There's no signature.

826
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:49,320
What are you laughing at?

827
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,239
Sure, you two.

828
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:52,599
Now you know it's embarrassing.

829
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:53,599
It's progress.

830
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,039
It's good that so many people think we can lose.

831
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,360
No pressure.

832
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,360
Xiangzi just joined the team.

833
00:42:58,599 --> 00:42:59,880
Tomorrow is the perfect time

834
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,920
To get used to it.

835
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:03,039
Even the defending champion

836
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:04,920
If they dare to look down on us,

837
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:06,760
And ate them in one bite.

838
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:08,239
Lu Xiao Bei,

839
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:09,440
Just this one.

840
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,800
I really admire you.

841
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:12,199
Yes?

842
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,320
You finally found my strengths?

843
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,719
Is the confidence of the fans.

844
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,400
You don't need me to mobilize this time.

845
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,599
We all know the grudge inside.

846
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:26,079
So our task

847
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,079
Not only the competition,

848
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,880
Boss asked me to tell you something.

849
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,119
The best defeat.

850
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,760
It's humiliating.

851
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:33,880
Are you clear?

852
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,760
Understood

853
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:35,719
dissolution

854
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,320
Why are you still here?

855
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:49,280
I need more practice.

856
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,920
Make sure your former teammates know

857
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:54,079
How right it was to leave them.
