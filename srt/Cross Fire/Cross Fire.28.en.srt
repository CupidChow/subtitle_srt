1
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:33,752
Xu Wei.

2
00:02:34,712 --> 00:02:35,393
Where is the captain?

3
00:02:36,632 --> 00:02:37,273
Where is Feng?

4
00:02:50,632 --> 00:02:52,152
When does the doctor say he can wake up?

5
00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:53,272
I have no idea

6
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:55,592
The doctor said it depends on luck.

7
00:02:55,752 --> 00:02:57,233
What's going on?

8
00:02:59,073 --> 00:02:59,873
Xu Wei.

9
00:02:59,873 --> 00:03:00,952
Say something.

10
00:03:01,752 --> 00:03:02,632
Xiao Feng.

11
00:03:02,632 --> 00:03:04,433
Take me to a game experience.

12
00:03:04,592 --> 00:03:06,632
Their game equipment broke down.

13
00:03:06,913 --> 00:03:09,352
Thanks to An Lan's timely arrival,

14
00:03:09,352 --> 00:03:10,392
Or I'll be lying here.

15
00:03:10,952 --> 00:03:11,473
AnLuan

16
00:03:12,753 --> 00:03:13,913
How did you know something was going to happen?

17
00:03:14,392 --> 00:03:15,833
A friend of Xiao Feng told me.

18
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:17,032
Not a friend.

19
00:03:17,513 --> 00:03:18,873
Friends in the game.

20
00:03:18,873 --> 00:03:19,913
What's his name?

21
00:03:19,913 --> 00:03:20,873
I don't know either

22
00:03:20,952 --> 00:03:22,473
Don't worry about it now.

23
00:03:22,992 --> 00:03:25,113
Brother Feng is lying in bed unconscious.

24
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,992
They must have an explanation.

25
00:03:27,272 --> 00:03:29,632
We have been negotiating with the person in charge.

26
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:30,592
They want to get private.

27
00:03:30,592 --> 00:03:31,793
She's lying here.

28
00:03:31,793 --> 00:03:32,992
You want to get personal?

29
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:34,712
They promised to take full responsibility.

30
00:03:34,712 --> 00:03:36,272
Xiao Feng's future medical expenses

31
00:03:36,712 --> 00:03:38,432
We'll pay an extra one million yuan.

32
00:03:38,432 --> 00:03:39,712
700,000 yuan for the family.

33
00:03:40,113 --> 00:03:41,393
300,000 yuan for the team.

34
00:03:41,393 --> 00:03:43,072
The condition is to keep it a secret.

35
00:03:43,272 --> 00:03:45,272
I'm going to expose them on TV.

36
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:46,352
Before they experience it,

37
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:47,913
Has signed a disclaimer.

38
00:03:48,152 --> 00:03:49,352
And sign the agreement.

39
00:03:53,753 --> 00:03:55,432
This agreement

40
00:03:55,432 --> 00:03:57,313
The game experience is dangerous.

41
00:03:58,152 --> 00:04:00,352
The participant needs to accept the possibility of danger.

42
00:04:00,352 --> 00:04:02,232
And the possible consequences of the danger.

43
00:04:02,473 --> 00:04:03,792
If there is an accident,

44
00:04:03,992 --> 00:04:05,792
The company won't take any responsibility.

45
00:04:05,872 --> 00:04:07,272
What is this?

46
00:04:07,352 --> 00:04:08,072
Xu Wei.

47
00:04:08,193 --> 00:04:09,473
Are you stupid?

48
00:04:09,473 --> 00:04:11,232
How could you sign this?

49
00:04:11,673 --> 00:04:12,313
I don't know either

50
00:04:12,313 --> 00:04:13,352
It's all in English.

51
00:04:13,352 --> 00:04:14,432
I can't read it.

52
00:04:14,673 --> 00:04:15,632
I think Xiao Feng signed it.

53
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:16,593
I signed it.

54
00:04:17,512 --> 00:04:18,953
Let's calm down.

55
00:04:18,953 --> 00:04:20,473
Don't argue, okay?

56
00:04:20,632 --> 00:04:22,193
No one wants this to happen.

57
00:04:22,193 --> 00:04:23,152
Everyone is upset.

58
00:04:23,193 --> 00:04:24,113
Then we can fight.

59
00:04:24,113 --> 00:04:25,553
You can go to court with them.

60
00:04:25,553 --> 00:04:26,033
After the lawsuit,

61
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,953
The game company can declare bankruptcy.

62
00:04:28,113 --> 00:04:29,033
In the end,

63
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:30,193
And ask them to pay compensation.

64
00:04:30,193 --> 00:04:30,992
We're done.

65
00:04:31,193 --> 00:04:32,193
I can guarantee that the money

66
00:04:32,193 --> 00:04:33,593
It must be less than now.

67
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:35,992
Captain, whose side are you on?

68
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:37,833
Of course I'm on Xiao Feng's side.

69
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:38,632
You're killing the fish.

70
00:04:38,632 --> 00:04:39,993
What's the benefit to Xiao Feng?

71
00:04:40,153 --> 00:04:41,232
You're relieved.

72
00:04:41,352 --> 00:04:42,713
What about Xiao Feng's treatment fee?

73
00:04:42,713 --> 00:04:43,832
Are you going out?

74
00:04:44,072 --> 00:04:45,632
His parents only have him.

75
00:04:45,713 --> 00:04:47,193
Who will take care of the two old people?

76
00:04:47,193 --> 00:04:48,232
Have you thought about it?

77
00:04:49,753 --> 00:04:50,473
Your mouth is money.

78
00:04:50,473 --> 00:04:51,473
Shut up. It's money.

79
00:04:51,753 --> 00:04:53,473
You think so far.

80
00:04:53,672 --> 00:04:54,232
No

81
00:04:55,952 --> 00:04:57,392
You can't even read people well.

82
00:04:57,552 --> 00:04:58,593
What are you doing?

83
00:04:58,593 --> 00:04:59,033
Come on.

84
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:00,473
You hit me from here to here.

85
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:02,352
If you hit me, I can make him alive.

86
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:02,913
Just do it.

87
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:03,952
I didn't say a word.

88
00:05:03,952 --> 00:05:04,593
Come on.

89
00:05:04,593 --> 00:05:05,873
Stop fooling around.

90
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:06,753
Let go

91
00:05:06,753 --> 00:05:07,713
What are you doing?

92
00:05:07,832 --> 00:05:08,913
This is a hospital.

93
00:05:09,593 --> 00:05:11,033
If you want to make trouble outside,

94
00:05:13,273 --> 00:05:14,232
Get out of here.

95
00:05:29,593 --> 00:05:30,672
Uncle, have some water.

96
00:05:31,552 --> 00:05:32,153
good

97
00:05:34,952 --> 00:05:35,993
Uncle and aunt.

98
00:05:36,193 --> 00:05:37,753
Don't be too sad.

99
00:05:41,512 --> 00:05:44,512
I don't know when I will wake up.

100
00:05:47,193 --> 00:05:47,632
aunt

101
00:05:48,952 --> 00:05:49,792
Don't be too sad.

102
00:05:50,232 --> 00:05:51,112
I asked someone to find it today.

103
00:05:51,112 --> 00:05:53,033
Director Wang of the Department of Neurology of Provincial Third Hospital.

104
00:05:53,273 --> 00:05:54,873
I showed him Xiao Feng's medical record.

105
00:05:55,593 --> 00:05:56,273
He said

106
00:05:56,392 --> 00:05:57,832
With Xiao Feng's condition,

107
00:05:57,832 --> 00:05:59,832
There is still a great chance to wake up.

108
00:06:00,352 --> 00:06:01,112
Really?

109
00:06:01,352 --> 00:06:02,632
He really said that?

110
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:03,433
Really?

111
00:06:03,753 --> 00:06:05,512
Director Wang is a national famous expert.

112
00:06:05,512 --> 00:06:06,832
What he said must be guaranteed.

113
00:06:07,313 --> 00:06:09,072
An Lan and I will take good care of Xiao Feng.

114
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:12,672
Take care of yourself.

115
00:06:12,993 --> 00:06:13,873
Take care

116
00:06:14,672 --> 00:06:16,193
I treat you as my parents.

117
00:06:17,313 --> 00:06:18,352
If there's anything else,

118
00:06:18,352 --> 00:06:19,512
Call me anytime.

119
00:06:20,993 --> 00:06:22,193
Take a rest.

120
00:06:22,193 --> 00:06:23,153
I'll cook for you.

121
00:06:23,552 --> 00:06:24,512
I'll help you.

122
00:06:25,632 --> 00:06:26,392
Aunt, have some water.

123
00:06:32,952 --> 00:06:34,273
Xiao Xu's friend

124
00:06:35,753 --> 00:06:37,512
Xiao Feng didn't pay for nothing.

125
00:06:43,433 --> 00:06:43,993
Hello.

126
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:48,273
doctor

127
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,192
Can he still wake up?

128
00:06:51,552 --> 00:06:53,473
The chances of the patient waking up

129
00:06:53,473 --> 00:06:54,473
Still exists.

130
00:06:55,073 --> 00:06:56,513
But in theory,

131
00:06:57,073 --> 00:06:58,513
Eleven years have passed.

132
00:06:58,672 --> 00:06:59,872
For normal people,

133
00:07:00,073 --> 00:07:01,273
Is almost an era.

134
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:03,112
For a vegetable,

135
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:05,112
Maybe I just made

136
00:07:05,273 --> 00:07:06,033
A long dream.

137
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:07,633
I'll take this patient.

138
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:09,073
For more than eight years.

139
00:07:09,593 --> 00:07:10,872
The basic condition of his body

140
00:07:11,112 --> 00:07:12,033
Is stable.

141
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:13,752
Just brain waves.

142
00:07:13,752 --> 00:07:15,513
Always lower than Delta.

143
00:07:16,593 --> 00:07:17,432
What do you mean?

144
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:18,552
Let me put it this way.

145
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:20,792
The electrical waves of the human brain

146
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:22,872
According to the fluctuation frequency,

147
00:07:22,872 --> 00:07:24,112
Can be divided into four categories.

148
00:07:24,633 --> 00:07:26,872
In a stressful situation,

149
00:07:26,872 --> 00:07:29,232
The frequency of brain waves is above 14 hertz.

150
00:07:29,473 --> 00:07:30,672
We call it Betapo.

151
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,513
When you study and think,

152
00:07:32,513 --> 00:07:34,273
The brain presents alpha waves.

153
00:07:34,752 --> 00:07:36,752
When you relax, it's Sitapo.

154
00:07:36,992 --> 00:07:38,552
And Delta Wave

155
00:07:38,552 --> 00:07:40,552
Was in a deep sleep.

156
00:07:40,552 --> 00:07:41,953
A state of brain waves.

157
00:07:41,953 --> 00:07:44,312
The frequency is between 0.5 and 3 hertz.

158
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:46,552
What about his condition?

159
00:07:46,672 --> 00:07:48,792
I'll show you his EEG.

160
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:49,992
this

161
00:07:51,153 --> 00:07:51,752
Look at him.

162
00:07:52,913 --> 00:07:53,552
Xiao Feng.

163
00:07:53,552 --> 00:07:55,393
Since being transferred to our hospital,

164
00:07:55,513 --> 00:07:56,513
His brain waves

165
00:07:56,513 --> 00:07:58,432
Has always been below 0.5 hertz.

166
00:07:58,872 --> 00:08:00,192
Can be neglected.

167
00:08:00,752 --> 00:08:02,073
It's like

168
00:08:02,913 --> 00:08:03,833
What is it?

169
00:08:04,112 --> 00:08:05,953
Although his body is coming,

170
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:07,073
But his consciousness

171
00:08:07,633 --> 00:08:08,713
I don't know where it went.

172
00:08:13,073 --> 00:08:14,633
I've got another 400,000.

173
00:08:15,513 --> 00:08:16,593
1.4 million yuan.

174
00:08:17,393 --> 00:08:18,792
Xiao Feng's future treatment costs

175
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:19,953
And they are fully responsible for it.

176
00:08:20,393 --> 00:08:22,513
This is the best I can do.

177
00:08:23,112 --> 00:08:24,432
And my aunts and uncles have signed it.

178
00:08:42,232 --> 00:08:43,033
Let's go, Ming.

179
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:44,312
Old sand.

180
00:08:45,153 --> 00:08:45,593
monkey

181
00:08:48,552 --> 00:08:49,112
Unicorn

182
00:08:53,913 --> 00:08:54,393
AnLuan

183
00:08:55,232 --> 00:08:56,112
This coin

184
00:08:56,552 --> 00:08:57,953
I wanted to keep it for myself.

185
00:08:58,552 --> 00:08:59,312
Now that I think about it,

186
00:08:59,752 --> 00:09:00,752
You should keep it.

187
00:09:14,713 --> 00:09:15,713
I don't understand.

188
00:09:15,713 --> 00:09:16,593
Why do they all think

189
00:09:16,593 --> 00:09:17,713
I harmed Xiao Feng.

190
00:09:18,232 --> 00:09:19,633
Such a serious thing happened.

191
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,792
They won't be able to accept it for a while.

192
00:09:22,593 --> 00:09:23,792
What's your future plan?

193
00:09:24,312 --> 00:09:25,033
Go back to school.

194
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:27,992
Stay here.

195
00:09:28,593 --> 00:09:30,393
Let's go on with the team.

196
00:09:32,192 --> 00:09:33,352
Thank you for your kindness.

197
00:09:33,752 --> 00:09:35,792
But I want to challenge something more difficult.

198
00:09:36,672 --> 00:09:37,713
More important things.

199
00:09:38,432 --> 00:09:39,752
What is more important?

200
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,073
Xiao Feng used to say

201
00:09:42,672 --> 00:09:44,473
The e-sports environment is tough.

202
00:09:44,713 --> 00:09:46,833
If people could understand us more,

203
00:09:47,192 --> 00:09:48,473
Maybe there will be more people.

204
00:09:48,473 --> 00:09:50,273
To recognize who you really are.

205
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:52,792
Dare to struggle for your dream.

206
00:09:53,312 --> 00:09:55,792
Actually, his dream is not only to win the championship,

207
00:09:57,352 --> 00:09:59,432
He always wanted to set up an e-sports league.

208
00:10:00,752 --> 00:10:02,393
Everyone can hold a group to keep warm.

209
00:10:02,473 --> 00:10:04,872
To give more teams a chance to develop.

210
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:06,713
I think this dream is great.

211
00:10:08,073 --> 00:10:09,552
I want to achieve it.

212
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:11,913
When Xiao Feng wakes up one day,

213
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:14,073
I can give him a big surprise.

214
00:10:14,872 --> 00:10:15,992
Let's work together.

215
00:10:23,473 --> 00:10:24,953
You can't wait for that day.

216
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:26,953
He won't wake up.

217
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:46,992
Why?

218
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:49,192
Sit down and try it on.

219
00:10:50,352 --> 00:10:50,913
I don't need it.

220
00:10:51,073 --> 00:10:52,192
My feet have almost recovered.

221
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:54,352
You're stubborn now.

222
00:10:55,672 --> 00:10:56,393
Try it on.

223
00:10:56,872 --> 00:10:57,872
I worked so hard.

224
00:10:57,953 --> 00:10:59,593
To transport my wheelchair from Ning Jiang.

225
00:10:59,953 --> 00:11:00,713
At least try.

226
00:11:01,112 --> 00:11:01,672
I've crossed the line.

227
00:11:04,472 --> 00:11:05,552
Hurry up and try it.

228
00:11:05,952 --> 00:11:07,552
I've never let anyone sit in my wheelchair.

229
00:11:07,913 --> 00:11:08,792
I have made an exception for you.

230
00:11:08,873 --> 00:11:09,792
Don't push your luck.

231
00:11:16,312 --> 00:11:16,832
brake

232
00:11:18,513 --> 00:11:18,993
Turn around.

233
00:11:19,832 --> 00:11:20,552
How come?

234
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:21,712
Drop it with your hands.

235
00:11:21,712 --> 00:11:22,552
Right, right. To the back.

236
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:24,592
Watch the slope.

237
00:11:27,273 --> 00:11:28,432
Lu Xiao Bei,

238
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:34,712
Is this so sharp?

239
00:11:37,353 --> 00:11:38,753
If you want to laugh at me,

240
00:11:38,952 --> 00:11:39,712
You can leave now.

241
00:11:40,712 --> 00:11:42,113
How could I laugh at you?

242
00:11:42,873 --> 00:11:43,873
I'm here to comfort you.

243
00:11:44,552 --> 00:11:45,192
I'm fine.

244
00:11:45,312 --> 00:11:46,353
What do I have to offer?

245
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:48,552
You must have eaten instant noodles these days.

246
00:11:49,393 --> 00:11:50,072
How do you know?

247
00:11:54,712 --> 00:11:55,712
When I limped,

248
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:57,432
I've never been so irresponsible to myself.

249
00:11:58,513 --> 00:11:58,993
Let's go.

250
00:11:59,712 --> 00:12:00,913
I'll take you to eat something delicious.

251
00:12:01,913 --> 00:12:03,312
Really?

252
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:06,113
You pushed me.

253
00:12:07,672 --> 00:12:08,993
Wipe the instant noodles on your mouth.

254
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:17,113
Waiter, one serving of beef.

255
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:18,792
Two please.

256
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:21,153
You're so rude to kill me.

257
00:12:21,552 --> 00:12:22,312
The internship is paid.

258
00:12:22,513 --> 00:12:22,993
Please.

259
00:12:29,672 --> 00:12:30,192
Xiaobei

260
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:31,633
Xiaobei

261
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:39,312
Lu Xiao Bei,

262
00:12:39,432 --> 00:12:40,273
What a coincidence.

263
00:12:42,432 --> 00:12:43,233
You look familiar.

264
00:12:43,552 --> 00:12:44,472
Do you mind if I sit down?

265
00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:45,513
Hello

266
00:12:45,513 --> 00:12:46,113
I'm Ding Ding.

267
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:47,113
Who is it?

268
00:12:48,592 --> 00:12:49,472
This is Chu Ge.

269
00:12:49,952 --> 00:12:50,472
My

270
00:12:50,472 --> 00:12:51,393
The former high school student.

271
00:12:54,072 --> 00:12:55,513
Are you a girl?

272
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,033
Nothing.

273
00:13:00,393 --> 00:13:01,913
You're quite delicate when I look at you.

274
00:13:04,113 --> 00:13:06,712
You two are eating here.

275
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,192
Will I bother you here?

276
00:13:10,033 --> 00:13:10,432
can't

277
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:12,672
That's good.

278
00:13:12,873 --> 00:13:13,633
It's okay.

279
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:14,993
I'll just say a few words and then I will leave.

280
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:15,592
to feel relieved

281
00:13:15,832 --> 00:13:16,192
good

282
00:13:16,472 --> 00:13:16,913
There's another sentence.

283
00:13:19,552 --> 00:13:20,353
She has such a temper.

284
00:13:23,873 --> 00:13:24,513
it doesn't matter

285
00:13:24,913 --> 00:13:25,393
I like it.

286
00:13:25,832 --> 00:13:26,312
Correct!

287
00:13:26,513 --> 00:13:27,913
Next week,

288
00:13:27,913 --> 00:13:29,592
Do you want to fight against the Mars Team?

289
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:31,233
They have been practicing for the past two days.

290
00:13:31,672 --> 00:13:33,072
It's said that they have found it.

291
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:34,993
Against Wang Kai.

292
00:13:35,192 --> 00:13:36,233
Do you want to know?

293
00:13:37,153 --> 00:13:38,472
If you want to know,

294
00:13:38,472 --> 00:13:39,273
And treat me to a hot pot.

295
00:13:39,273 --> 00:13:39,792
I'll tell you.

296
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:41,432
No, I'm fine.

297
00:13:42,913 --> 00:13:43,913
Leave me some suspense.

298
00:13:45,153 --> 00:13:45,672
Sure enough

299
00:13:46,472 --> 00:13:47,712
The sun is a scorpion.

300
00:13:48,312 --> 00:13:49,913
Rising is capricorn.

301
00:13:49,993 --> 00:13:51,592
I don't like to be threatened.

302
00:13:52,672 --> 00:13:53,393
How do you know?

303
00:13:56,472 --> 00:13:57,273
Lu Xiao Bei,

304
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,273
If I want to get to know you,

305
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:01,072
I know everything about you.

306
00:14:01,153 --> 00:14:02,592
So you must be careful.

307
00:14:04,312 --> 00:14:04,952
Are you finished?

308
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:08,633
Why?

309
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:09,592
Are you jealous?

310
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:11,913
Correct!

311
00:14:13,113 --> 00:14:14,072
I forgot to introduce you.

312
00:14:14,072 --> 00:14:14,913
I know.

313
00:14:14,913 --> 00:14:16,033
I've already said that.

314
00:14:16,033 --> 00:14:17,472
She was your former desk mate in high school.

315
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:18,192
yes

316
00:14:18,712 --> 00:14:19,472
It's also me.

317
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:20,792
Now,

318
00:14:21,113 --> 00:14:21,792
girlfriend

319
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:28,353
Your girlfriend?

320
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:31,472
When did you have a girlfriend?

321
00:14:32,592 --> 00:14:33,353
It seems

322
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:34,792
You don't know me well enough.

323
00:14:35,113 --> 00:14:35,993
You're here.

324
00:14:36,672 --> 00:14:37,672
Let's take a photo together.

325
00:14:40,153 --> 00:14:40,513
Alright.

326
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:50,913
one

327
00:14:51,993 --> 00:14:54,393
two

328
00:14:55,113 --> 00:14:57,312
three

329
00:14:57,472 --> 00:14:58,072
Stop shooting.

330
00:14:58,072 --> 00:14:58,552
to wait a moment

331
00:14:58,552 --> 00:14:59,552
There's another one.

332
00:15:01,873 --> 00:15:03,712
four

333
00:15:04,753 --> 00:15:05,312
Shoot it yourself.

334
00:15:12,993 --> 00:15:13,753
Lu Xiao Bei,

335
00:15:13,753 --> 00:15:15,312
You will die sooner or later.

336
00:15:16,672 --> 00:15:18,312
I just feel sorry for the beef in the pot.

337
00:15:18,592 --> 00:15:19,312
It's getting old.

338
00:15:21,993 --> 00:15:23,033
Are you still mad at me?

339
00:15:23,552 --> 00:15:24,552
I'm fine.

340
00:15:24,712 --> 00:15:26,033
Girl, I'm fine.

341
00:15:26,432 --> 00:15:28,353
Are the most horrible words in the world.

342
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:34,432
I'm just sad.

343
00:15:35,672 --> 00:15:36,552
in the past always

344
00:15:36,753 --> 00:15:38,033
You took care of my study.

345
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,233
Take care of my life.

346
00:15:39,712 --> 00:15:41,832
And sometimes take care of my emotions.

347
00:15:43,432 --> 00:15:44,233
But what about me?

348
00:15:45,672 --> 00:15:46,633
as if

349
00:15:46,832 --> 00:15:48,393
I can do nothing but thank you.

350
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:51,432
Actually, I know.

351
00:15:51,753 --> 00:15:53,233
Last time, you came to An Lan,

352
00:15:53,513 --> 00:15:54,753
Something very important, right?

353
00:15:57,993 --> 00:15:58,832
There are some things

354
00:16:00,153 --> 00:16:01,753
I can't explain it to you.

355
00:16:02,393 --> 00:16:03,312
You don't have to explain.

356
00:16:04,072 --> 00:16:05,792
I just want to tell you that

357
00:16:06,753 --> 00:16:07,353
Moose

358
00:16:08,312 --> 00:16:09,873
I'm never afraid of finding the sand pile.

359
00:16:10,913 --> 00:16:11,432
friend

360
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:13,312
It's for wind and rain.

361
00:16:15,353 --> 00:16:16,513
Someone once said

362
00:16:22,552 --> 00:16:22,993
Correct!

363
00:16:23,393 --> 00:16:24,513
That Ding Ding.

364
00:16:24,832 --> 00:16:25,432
Are you angry?

365
00:16:25,672 --> 00:16:26,233
Let's go.

366
00:16:30,273 --> 00:16:30,873
this

367
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:32,113
You should go.

368
00:16:32,353 --> 00:16:33,513
She has nothing to be angry about.

369
00:16:33,513 --> 00:16:34,952
Is there a place for her to talk?

370
00:16:35,233 --> 00:16:36,312
What is she?

371
00:16:38,712 --> 00:16:39,672
Lahei, I'm telling you.

372
00:16:40,072 --> 00:16:40,792
It's black.

373
00:16:42,672 --> 00:16:43,353
It's black.

374
00:16:43,513 --> 00:16:44,233
There's no hesitation.

375
00:16:45,432 --> 00:16:46,592
Show me the chat record.

376
00:16:51,072 --> 00:16:52,353
Has been deleted.

377
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:01,552
Xiaobei

378
00:17:01,873 --> 00:17:03,113
Although I'm your boss,

379
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:04,753
Ten years older than you.

380
00:17:05,672 --> 00:17:06,592
I've been

381
00:17:06,672 --> 00:17:07,832
Treat you as a good brother.

382
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:09,873
I hope you can be

383
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:11,153
Will develop well.

384
00:17:11,432 --> 00:17:12,113
Go further.

385
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:13,832
come

386
00:17:14,153 --> 00:17:15,113
Let's have a drink.

387
00:17:15,353 --> 00:17:15,993
No, President Guo.

388
00:17:16,513 --> 00:17:17,513
I have to train later.

389
00:17:18,192 --> 00:17:19,153
What's wrong?

390
00:17:19,393 --> 00:17:20,153
Just say it directly.

391
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:24,913
a row

392
00:17:25,592 --> 00:17:26,312
Lately

393
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:27,353
There is such a thing.

394
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:28,592
I have good news.

395
00:17:29,312 --> 00:17:30,672
The boss of Wei Feng Hall.

396
00:17:30,672 --> 00:17:31,753
And had dinner with me.

397
00:17:32,113 --> 00:17:33,913
He expressed his appreciation for you.

398
00:17:34,113 --> 00:17:35,153
I want to work with you.

399
00:17:35,672 --> 00:17:36,472
As you know,

400
00:17:36,552 --> 00:17:38,672
Their team has a good record in the past two years.

401
00:17:38,753 --> 00:17:39,513
this year

402
00:17:39,712 --> 00:17:41,312
They want to compete in the finals.

403
00:17:41,832 --> 00:17:42,832
I think

404
00:17:43,033 --> 00:17:44,993
This is a good chance for you.

405
00:17:47,753 --> 00:17:49,072
Are you going to sell me?

406
00:17:49,233 --> 00:17:50,552
Look what you said.

407
00:17:50,552 --> 00:17:51,753
How can it be sold?

408
00:17:51,873 --> 00:17:52,792
As you know,

409
00:17:52,993 --> 00:17:54,393
I'm not only working on the team,

410
00:17:54,393 --> 00:17:56,153
I have a lot of other business to do.

411
00:17:56,153 --> 00:17:58,033
I've been in a bad period for two years.

412
00:17:58,273 --> 00:17:59,552
I've already planned it.

413
00:17:59,672 --> 00:18:00,832
No matter our team,

414
00:18:00,832 --> 00:18:01,753
How are your grades?

415
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:02,712
this year

416
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:04,513
It's really the last year.

417
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:05,832
So I want to

418
00:18:05,913 --> 00:18:07,393
The team is doing well recently.

419
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:09,153
At a good price.

420
00:18:09,832 --> 00:18:11,592
I'm doing it for your own good.

421
00:18:11,672 --> 00:18:12,153
Look.

422
00:18:12,672 --> 00:18:14,273
You're too powerful.

423
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:15,353
Are we supposed to have

424
00:18:15,353 --> 00:18:16,633
A better development space.

425
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:17,873
A better platform.

426
00:18:18,153 --> 00:18:19,153
This is my place.

427
00:18:19,312 --> 00:18:20,432
The temple is too small.

428
00:18:20,672 --> 00:18:21,832
Think about it.

429
00:18:28,113 --> 00:18:29,273
How much money can a person sell?

430
00:18:29,832 --> 00:18:30,472
How about this?

431
00:18:31,993 --> 00:18:33,273
I'll buy the whole team.

432
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:35,233
Buy a team.

433
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:42,432
Please make a price.

434
00:18:43,672 --> 00:18:44,513
Everybody is here

435
00:18:44,913 --> 00:18:45,712
Let me say something.

436
00:18:46,153 --> 00:18:47,432
President Guo talked to me just now.

437
00:18:47,913 --> 00:18:49,113
He's not going to be a team anymore.

438
00:18:50,353 --> 00:18:51,192
He is going to

439
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,753
To sell me to Wei Feng Hall.

440
00:18:52,913 --> 00:18:54,312
And sell the club.

441
00:18:54,552 --> 00:18:56,113
Several teams have made offers.

442
00:18:57,393 --> 00:18:59,993
No wonder I've been looking at him differently recently.

443
00:18:59,993 --> 00:19:01,873
It turns out we are playing hard in the front.

444
00:19:02,312 --> 00:19:03,312
He's behind the scenes.

445
00:19:03,312 --> 00:19:04,712
I want to sell you.

446
00:19:04,913 --> 00:19:05,952
He's a businessman.

447
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:06,993
That's normal.

448
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:08,033
why?

449
00:19:08,033 --> 00:19:09,113
I'll go find him.

450
00:19:09,113 --> 00:19:09,672
Come on.

451
00:19:10,552 --> 00:19:11,873
Don't you know about President Guo?

452
00:19:12,472 --> 00:19:13,513
If he is persuaded,

453
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:15,753
Liu Xu can't do anything behind his back.

454
00:19:16,513 --> 00:19:17,312
So,

455
00:19:17,513 --> 00:19:18,712
We're breaking up again.

456
00:19:19,552 --> 00:19:20,832
I don't want to leave you.

457
00:19:22,513 --> 00:19:23,832
I've been thinking about it.

458
00:19:24,633 --> 00:19:25,712
If we don't separate,

459
00:19:26,153 --> 00:19:27,033
There's only one way.

460
00:19:27,552 --> 00:19:28,672
We can be the boss ourselves.

461
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:30,273
You mean to take the team

462
00:19:30,273 --> 00:19:31,753
From President Guo.

463
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:32,993
yes

464
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:35,113
I paid him half a day.

465
00:19:35,313 --> 00:19:35,952
minimum

466
00:19:36,712 --> 00:19:37,472
And 800 thousand yuan.

467
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,313
8 million yuan.

468
00:19:39,393 --> 00:19:40,472
Let's rob the bank.

469
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:41,192
go

470
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:42,313
Half of the down payment.

471
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:43,353
400,000 yuan.

472
00:19:43,672 --> 00:19:44,873
I asked my parents for 100,000 yuan.

473
00:19:44,992 --> 00:19:45,992
The remaining 300,000 yuan.

474
00:19:46,313 --> 00:19:47,313
We have to figure out a way.

475
00:19:48,032 --> 00:19:48,633
Lu Xiao Bei,

476
00:19:48,913 --> 00:19:50,633
Why are you doing this so rashly?

477
00:19:50,793 --> 00:19:52,512
This is business, not a game.

478
00:19:52,752 --> 00:19:53,873
Have you thought it through?

479
00:19:54,153 --> 00:19:55,512
Even if you get the down payment,

480
00:19:55,793 --> 00:19:56,712
What will you do in the future?

481
00:19:57,272 --> 00:19:58,472
If our team

482
00:19:58,472 --> 00:19:59,593
The competition is downgraded.

483
00:19:59,593 --> 00:20:01,032
Or something happened to the team.

484
00:20:01,192 --> 00:20:03,032
Isn't the money all wasted?

485
00:20:03,032 --> 00:20:05,073
I also think it's a bit shaky.

486
00:20:06,752 --> 00:20:07,712
The contract hasn't been signed yet.

487
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:08,992
If you don't agree,

488
00:20:09,272 --> 00:20:10,393
I respect your opinions.

489
00:20:23,232 --> 00:20:24,752
I usually spend money on impulse.

490
00:20:24,752 --> 00:20:25,672
Can't save much.

491
00:20:26,113 --> 00:20:27,113
Count as much as you have.

492
00:20:27,113 --> 00:20:27,633
It's all yours.

493
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,633
Anyway, I will be in the team.

494
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,992
All my money is in two cards here.

495
00:20:36,752 --> 00:20:38,073
The savings are all here.

496
00:20:38,873 --> 00:20:40,153
The password is...

497
00:20:40,153 --> 00:20:41,113
Susu's birthday.

498
00:20:49,633 --> 00:20:50,472
My salary

499
00:20:50,952 --> 00:20:51,593
Are all here.

500
00:20:58,593 --> 00:20:59,833
This is 250,000 yuan.

501
00:21:00,313 --> 00:21:01,952
My dad gave me the start-up capital.

502
00:21:04,752 --> 00:21:05,272
cipher

503
00:21:05,593 --> 00:21:06,353
To you on WeChat.

504
00:21:06,593 --> 00:21:07,833
What if your father knows?

505
00:21:08,472 --> 00:21:09,633
This is an investment.

506
00:21:09,952 --> 00:21:11,593
Is a major shareholder, right?

507
00:21:17,472 --> 00:21:18,432
The rest...

508
00:21:19,073 --> 00:21:19,913
I'll think of a way.

509
00:21:21,232 --> 00:21:21,833
enter

510
00:21:23,712 --> 00:21:24,232
Mr. An.

511
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:26,472
There's a professional league

512
00:21:26,472 --> 00:21:28,113
Do you want to see the change of ownership?

513
00:21:28,432 --> 00:21:29,232
I'm busy.

514
00:21:29,232 --> 00:21:31,032
I'll leave the matter to the Personnel Department.

515
00:21:31,032 --> 00:21:31,752
Don't bother.

516
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:35,073
This note may be a little special.

517
00:21:35,432 --> 00:21:36,672
I suggest you take a look.

518
00:21:37,073 --> 00:21:38,353
I can wait if you're busy.

519
00:21:38,913 --> 00:21:39,472
How special?

520
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,712
The new shareholder.

521
00:21:40,712 --> 00:21:42,232
Is the active player of this team.

522
00:21:43,272 --> 00:21:44,032
What team?

523
00:21:46,313 --> 00:21:46,992
Southern monster

524
00:21:48,272 --> 00:21:49,272
But from now on,

525
00:21:49,793 --> 00:21:50,833
They changed their name to Continuation Team.

526
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:57,393
Lu Xiao Bei may think things too easy.

527
00:21:57,593 --> 00:21:58,873
To run a professional team.

528
00:21:58,873 --> 00:21:59,633
Besides playing games,

529
00:21:59,633 --> 00:22:01,393
There are many things to deal with.

530
00:22:01,712 --> 00:22:02,472
I'm curious.

531
00:22:03,153 --> 00:22:04,353
How long can they last?

532
00:22:08,153 --> 00:22:08,593
Don't stand still.

533
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:09,073
Eat it too.

534
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:10,313
eat

535
00:22:11,192 --> 00:22:12,032
You have a good appetite.

536
00:22:12,913 --> 00:22:14,113
I have the energy to work.

537
00:22:15,272 --> 00:22:15,913
What did you say?

538
00:22:16,272 --> 00:22:18,192
I just said I'm not interested in

539
00:22:18,192 --> 00:22:19,113
You know him well.

540
00:22:21,032 --> 00:22:22,113
To continue the team.

541
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:23,313
good

542
00:22:23,793 --> 00:22:25,472
I'm not sure about the situation of your team.

543
00:22:25,472 --> 00:22:26,353
You know him well.

544
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,272
Although you have redeemed yourself,

545
00:22:28,353 --> 00:22:29,393
But you're out of money.

546
00:22:29,593 --> 00:22:31,113
The CFPL is a professional league.

547
00:22:31,113 --> 00:22:31,633
Waiter/Waitress

548
00:22:32,553 --> 00:22:34,752
It's not like you guys

549
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,272
You can make a good team.

550
00:22:36,712 --> 00:22:37,992
You have no money.

551
00:22:38,113 --> 00:22:38,472
this

552
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,192
And lack of logistics.

553
00:22:40,672 --> 00:22:42,032
Without logistics,

554
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:44,952
I don't have to say this.

555
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:46,873
No need for other teams to eliminate you.

556
00:22:46,873 --> 00:22:48,873
As long as your landlord raises the rent now,

557
00:22:49,113 --> 00:22:49,992
You can't stand it.

558
00:22:51,952 --> 00:22:52,393
WangKai

559
00:22:53,353 --> 00:22:54,553
I came to see you today.

560
00:22:54,793 --> 00:22:56,712
I hope you can think about it.

561
00:22:56,712 --> 00:22:57,712
Join our Victory Team.

562
00:22:58,353 --> 00:23:00,113
I promise to give you the main position.

563
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:01,313
Add tactical core.

564
00:23:01,633 --> 00:23:02,032
In addition

565
00:23:02,192 --> 00:23:03,353
The monthly salary is no less than 8,000 yuan.

566
00:23:04,353 --> 00:23:05,073
It's 8,000 yuan.

567
00:23:06,393 --> 00:23:07,113
How much do you want?

568
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,672
Top of the Forbidden City gave me a month.

569
00:23:09,672 --> 00:23:10,992
The price of 12 thousand yuan.

570
00:23:11,593 --> 00:23:12,113
I didn't go.

571
00:23:12,272 --> 00:23:13,712
How dare you say that?

572
00:23:14,313 --> 00:23:14,672
good

573
00:23:15,313 --> 00:23:16,712
I don't care what others treat you.

574
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:18,113
I'll give you another thousand.

575
00:23:19,952 --> 00:23:20,553
2,000 yuan.

576
00:23:25,712 --> 00:23:26,272
Are you still eating?

577
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:27,672
I'm not eating.

578
00:23:34,272 --> 00:23:34,873
thus

579
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:37,913
How much is it?

580
00:23:38,353 --> 00:23:39,512
I'll double it.

581
00:23:40,153 --> 00:23:40,873
Is that enough?

582
00:23:46,512 --> 00:23:46,992
Thank you

583
00:23:48,272 --> 00:23:49,192
Just because of you,

584
00:23:50,353 --> 00:23:52,232
When I play your Victory Team next time,

585
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:53,992
I'll blow your heads off.

586
00:24:02,952 --> 00:24:03,992
From now on,

587
00:24:04,073 --> 00:24:05,553
We will change back to the previous name.

588
00:24:06,313 --> 00:24:07,113
Go on.

589
00:24:07,472 --> 00:24:08,353
Keep going.

590
00:24:08,752 --> 00:24:09,432
However

591
00:24:09,432 --> 00:24:11,032
We don't have the money to buy new lights.

592
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,192
Just make do with this.

593
00:24:12,192 --> 00:24:13,472
It's better to stay on the team.

594
00:24:13,992 --> 00:24:15,393
Comfortable and domineering.

595
00:24:15,553 --> 00:24:16,353
One day,

596
00:24:16,553 --> 00:24:17,712
The name of the team.

597
00:24:17,793 --> 00:24:19,752
Will be engraved on the national championship trophy.

598
00:24:19,752 --> 00:24:21,393
On the trophy of the world champion.

599
00:24:21,952 --> 00:24:22,593
Brother Hao.

600
00:24:22,593 --> 00:24:24,393
The cattle you blow out will be cashed in.

601
00:24:25,353 --> 00:24:26,672
I have a dream.

602
00:24:27,073 --> 00:24:28,353
Be polite.

603
00:24:29,752 --> 00:24:31,113
I'm the majority shareholder now.

604
00:24:31,192 --> 00:24:33,032
My mood can directly affect

605
00:24:33,032 --> 00:24:34,633
The survival rate of other shareholders

606
00:24:35,192 --> 00:24:36,032
Do you understand?

607
00:24:37,113 --> 00:24:37,672
large stockholder

608
00:24:37,672 --> 00:24:38,952
There's an important thing.

609
00:24:38,952 --> 00:24:40,393
I need you to make a choice.

610
00:24:40,593 --> 00:24:40,992
say

611
00:24:41,593 --> 00:24:42,512
Tonight,

612
00:24:42,512 --> 00:24:43,553
Have a good supper.

613
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:47,432
This is not an upfront investment.

614
00:24:47,432 --> 00:24:48,593
Exceed the budget?

615
00:24:48,593 --> 00:24:50,432
We have to save a bit for the later period.

616
00:24:50,752 --> 00:24:52,393
Hold on and overcome the difficulties.

617
00:24:52,712 --> 00:24:53,952
There are several packets of instant noodles in the back warehouse.

618
00:24:54,752 --> 00:24:55,432
today

619
00:24:55,512 --> 00:24:56,313
We will continue to be the team.

620
00:24:56,313 --> 00:24:58,073
The first day of the professional league,

621
00:24:58,272 --> 00:24:59,192
Everyone has a dream.

622
00:24:59,593 --> 00:25:00,272
champion

623
00:25:00,593 --> 00:25:01,353
I want to take it too.

624
00:25:02,032 --> 00:25:03,913
But we still have to go step by step.

625
00:25:04,113 --> 00:25:04,952
This year,

626
00:25:05,153 --> 00:25:06,272
Our primary goal

627
00:25:06,553 --> 00:25:07,192
Or avoid relegation?

628
00:25:08,272 --> 00:25:09,032
Go on.

629
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:12,192
Come on

630
00:25:14,153 --> 00:25:14,712
how could that be?

631
00:25:14,712 --> 00:25:15,432
The power is off.

632
00:25:17,712 --> 00:25:18,593
Where are these two people? Where have they gone?

633
00:25:18,952 --> 00:25:19,752
WangKai

634
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:20,232
S+1

635
00:25:22,752 --> 00:25:23,833
What are you doing there?

636
00:25:24,073 --> 00:25:24,833
we

637
00:25:26,232 --> 00:25:27,113
Repair the electrical box.

638
00:25:29,192 --> 00:25:29,833
circuit box

639
00:25:30,232 --> 00:25:31,553
I guess the power card is out of charge.

640
00:25:33,512 --> 00:25:34,232
How could it be like this?

641
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:35,393
The credit card is maxed out.

642
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:36,712
What can we do

643
00:25:36,712 --> 00:25:37,313
What can we do

644
00:25:37,313 --> 00:25:37,952
What can we do

645
00:25:37,952 --> 00:25:38,633
What can we do

646
00:25:42,633 --> 00:25:43,512
otherwise

647
00:25:43,672 --> 00:25:44,793
Go to bed.

648
00:25:46,073 --> 00:25:47,873
We will repair the electrical box.

649
00:25:47,873 --> 00:25:49,153
What if it's the electrical box?

650
00:25:51,313 --> 00:25:52,672
I'll help him with the lights.

651
00:25:59,633 --> 00:26:00,313
that

652
00:26:01,432 --> 00:26:02,353
Be safe.

653
00:26:02,793 --> 00:26:03,633
We went to bed.

654
00:26:05,432 --> 00:26:05,992
excuse me

655
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:08,512
It's inconvenient to walk.

656
00:26:09,952 --> 00:26:10,992
Good night!

657
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:23,512
The electricity.

658
00:26:23,512 --> 00:26:24,113
Let's go.

659
00:26:24,113 --> 00:26:24,833
Let's go.

660
00:26:30,153 --> 00:26:31,073
Something's wrong.

661
00:26:31,593 --> 00:26:33,432
Xiao Bei, come to the training room.

662
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,952
Who are you? Don't move.

663
00:26:35,232 --> 00:26:36,032
What's up

664
00:26:36,032 --> 00:26:37,672
Something's wrong. Someone's here.

665
00:26:42,073 --> 00:26:43,793
We can't move.

666
00:26:43,793 --> 00:26:44,992
What are you doing?

667
00:26:44,992 --> 00:26:45,952
Give me a few more days.

668
00:26:45,952 --> 00:26:47,113
Give me a few more days.

669
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:49,073
It's not worth much to take these things.

670
00:26:49,153 --> 00:26:50,192
Just give me three days.

671
00:26:52,113 --> 00:26:53,353
Put it down.

672
00:26:53,353 --> 00:26:53,992
what are you doing?

673
00:26:53,992 --> 00:26:54,793
I'm telling you.

674
00:26:54,793 --> 00:26:55,793
I can live.

675
00:26:55,793 --> 00:26:58,153
I'll put all of you on the Internet.

676
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,192
Don't touch him.

677
00:26:59,913 --> 00:27:00,593
What are you doing?

678
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:02,593
Hit me?

679
00:27:02,633 --> 00:27:03,553
Get it back.

680
00:27:04,752 --> 00:27:05,672
Hit me?

681
00:27:05,672 --> 00:27:06,232
Don't touch me.

682
00:27:06,232 --> 00:27:06,752
Brothers!

683
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,272
We have something to talk about.

684
00:27:08,272 --> 00:27:10,232
Can I talk to President Guo about the contract?

685
00:27:10,272 --> 00:27:11,712
I'll call the police if you keep acting like this.

686
00:27:11,992 --> 00:27:12,672
As you wish.

687
00:27:12,952 --> 00:27:13,873
We'll pay the debts according to law.

688
00:27:14,192 --> 00:27:15,593
Xiao Bei, don't call the police.

689
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:16,353
President Guo sent our contract

690
00:27:16,353 --> 00:27:17,113
To the new creditors.

691
00:27:17,113 --> 00:27:18,672
They were called by the new creditors.

692
00:27:18,793 --> 00:27:20,313
And we haven't paid the balance.

693
00:27:20,313 --> 00:27:21,313
The contract is violated.

694
00:27:21,712 --> 00:27:22,833
I'm telling you,

695
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:24,153
You're pointing something.

696
00:27:24,153 --> 00:27:25,472
It's not worth much.

697
00:27:25,472 --> 00:27:26,712
Get the money ready.

698
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:27,752
We will come again tomorrow.

699
00:27:27,952 --> 00:27:28,593
go

700
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:31,153
Bastard

701
00:27:31,153 --> 00:27:33,032
Are you bullying me like this?

702
00:27:40,633 --> 00:27:41,593
Is your hand okay?

703
00:27:57,952 --> 00:27:59,432
You really need a leader.

704
00:28:00,353 --> 00:28:02,432
Who would want to take over this mess now?

705
00:28:05,073 --> 00:28:05,512
I

706
00:28:08,432 --> 00:28:09,153
Stop joking.

707
00:28:09,353 --> 00:28:10,073
I'm serious.

708
00:28:10,073 --> 00:28:11,032
I'm serious too.

709
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:12,432
Now there's no computer.

710
00:28:12,593 --> 00:28:14,553
Some things can't be solved with attitude.

711
00:28:16,752 --> 00:28:17,992
I minored in e-sports.

712
00:28:18,032 --> 00:28:19,032
Now,

713
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:20,712
As an intern in the ES Competition Department.

714
00:28:20,913 --> 00:28:22,313
I know every one of you.

715
00:28:22,313 --> 00:28:23,873
I know what a leader should do.

716
00:28:25,633 --> 00:28:27,553
I support Chu Ge as our leader.

717
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:28,633
I have one vote.

718
00:28:29,633 --> 00:28:30,432
I'll vote too.

719
00:28:31,672 --> 00:28:32,192
And me.

720
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:33,272
Xiaobei

721
00:28:33,272 --> 00:28:34,833
Our team is now a fire pit.

722
00:28:35,192 --> 00:28:36,512
Who wants to jump in now?

723
00:28:36,752 --> 00:28:37,992
Don't ask for anything.

724
00:28:42,113 --> 00:28:42,992
I want to know.

725
00:28:43,793 --> 00:28:44,512
If you come,

726
00:28:45,232 --> 00:28:45,952
What are you going to do?

727
00:28:47,472 --> 00:28:49,153
If we can find investment,

728
00:28:49,153 --> 00:28:50,553
All these problems can be solved.

729
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:52,553
The team just redeemed.

730
00:28:52,553 --> 00:28:53,353
I don't want to sell it anymore.

731
00:28:54,153 --> 00:28:55,672
Accepting investment is not the same as selling.

732
00:28:55,672 --> 00:28:56,952
We can talk about the terms.

733
00:28:57,113 --> 00:28:58,432
I'd rather borrow money.

734
00:28:58,952 --> 00:29:00,393
I don't want to be a monster of the South.

735
00:29:00,913 --> 00:29:02,672
I don't want to fall again.

736
00:29:03,113 --> 00:29:03,992
Then we can't

737
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,432
You fell and didn't go forward.

738
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:07,232
How much does it cost to run a professional team?

739
00:29:07,232 --> 00:29:07,913
You know what?

740
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,032
With family support,

741
00:29:09,232 --> 00:29:10,032
To borrow it.

742
00:29:10,113 --> 00:29:10,833
That's not enough.

743
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:11,672
The competition is about people.

744
00:29:11,672 --> 00:29:12,472
It's not money.

745
00:29:12,472 --> 00:29:13,353
No matter how good the car is,

746
00:29:13,432 --> 00:29:14,512
You can't run far without oil.

747
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:16,873
Gravity won the title two years in a row.

748
00:29:16,873 --> 00:29:18,553
First, he's really powerful.

749
00:29:18,553 --> 00:29:19,073
two

750
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,593
It's the biggest club in the league.

751
00:29:22,913 --> 00:29:24,192
You two are not contradictory.

752
00:29:24,272 --> 00:29:25,432
I only have one question now.

753
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:27,032
Where can I find investors?

754
00:29:27,672 --> 00:29:28,992
A team with potential.

755
00:29:28,992 --> 00:29:30,153
Should have no trouble finding investors.

756
00:29:30,313 --> 00:29:32,153
When we have the backing of our father,

757
00:29:32,153 --> 00:29:34,232
We'll change to the latest configuration.

758
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:37,672
Plus, Yi Shui's latest e-sports chair.

759
00:29:38,512 --> 00:29:40,032
Actually, the most important thing

760
00:29:40,032 --> 00:29:41,153
We should get some machines.

761
00:29:41,512 --> 00:29:43,073
We can't be like before.

762
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:44,153
Go to the Internet café to practice shooting.

763
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:45,432
no problem

764
00:29:46,153 --> 00:29:47,952
Take this as my first task as a leader.

765
00:29:53,913 --> 00:29:54,272
enter

766
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:02,192
Is there anything else?

767
00:30:08,512 --> 00:30:09,113
What is this?

768
00:30:13,393 --> 00:30:14,153
You want to resign?

769
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:15,633
Yes

770
00:30:16,032 --> 00:30:16,553
Please approve it.

771
00:30:17,113 --> 00:30:17,913
Transfer of work.

772
00:30:17,913 --> 00:30:18,793
I'm ready.

773
00:30:19,913 --> 00:30:20,553
Have a seat.

774
00:30:25,712 --> 00:30:26,952
Give me a reason for approval.

775
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:28,672
You know that.

776
00:30:29,032 --> 00:30:30,472
I came to this industry as an intern.

777
00:30:30,472 --> 00:30:31,593
To gain experience.

778
00:30:31,992 --> 00:30:32,712
I hope that in the future,

779
00:30:32,712 --> 00:30:34,153
Who can help me.

780
00:30:35,472 --> 00:30:36,472
although

781
00:30:36,472 --> 00:30:37,833
I'm not ready yet.

782
00:30:38,553 --> 00:30:40,232
But now he needs me the most.

783
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,512
I have to go.

784
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:42,992
Your deskmate

785
00:30:43,793 --> 00:30:44,633
It's Lu Xiao Bei.

786
00:30:47,113 --> 00:30:49,073
He's the one who helped me run from last.

787
00:30:50,712 --> 00:30:51,873
How are you going to help him?

788
00:30:52,593 --> 00:30:53,672
I haven't thought about it.

789
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:57,353
But there must be a way.

790
00:31:06,113 --> 00:31:06,553
President Guo.

791
00:31:07,793 --> 00:31:08,593
Who are you?

792
00:31:08,593 --> 00:31:09,633
I'm Lu Xiao Bei's friend.

793
00:31:10,232 --> 00:31:10,913
What's the matter

794
00:31:11,272 --> 00:31:13,192
The debt company took away their computers yesterday.

795
00:31:13,393 --> 00:31:13,913
Do you know?

796
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,992
I have transferred the contract.

797
00:31:15,992 --> 00:31:17,633
This has nothing to do with me.

798
00:31:17,633 --> 00:31:18,512
I know.

799
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:20,073
But they have to play games.

800
00:31:20,472 --> 00:31:22,113
You can't train without computers.

801
00:31:22,393 --> 00:31:23,272
I can't find them.

802
00:31:23,272 --> 00:31:24,113
I can only come to you.

803
00:31:24,272 --> 00:31:26,472
My contract transfer is legal.

804
00:31:26,472 --> 00:31:27,353
Go and investigate.

805
00:31:27,873 --> 00:31:28,752
Debt problems

806
00:31:28,752 --> 00:31:30,272
We will figure out a way to solve it.

807
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:31,952
But computers are very important

808
00:31:31,952 --> 00:31:32,913
It's really important.

809
00:31:33,113 --> 00:31:34,393
I'll tell you again.

810
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:37,073
It's Lu Xiao Bei's business with the contract owner.

811
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:38,793
It's no use looking for me.

812
00:31:42,793 --> 00:31:43,232
President Guo.

813
00:31:44,952 --> 00:31:46,432
You used to be an e-sports player.

814
00:31:47,593 --> 00:31:48,672
And crowded into the basement.

815
00:31:49,272 --> 00:31:50,992
And took a hard seat to compete.

816
00:31:51,313 --> 00:31:53,432
From a small team to today,

817
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:54,313
Right?

818
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:55,272
yes

819
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:57,232
But that's all in the past.

820
00:31:57,512 --> 00:31:59,153
So the situation of Lu Xiao Bei and them

821
00:31:59,153 --> 00:31:59,873
Others don't understand.

822
00:31:59,873 --> 00:32:01,032
But you must understand.

823
00:32:01,192 --> 00:32:02,272
But I'm really sorry.

824
00:32:02,672 --> 00:32:04,353
I really don't want to

825
00:32:04,353 --> 00:32:05,593
Has anything to do with it.

826
00:32:06,913 --> 00:32:07,672
Stop looking for me.

827
00:32:10,353 --> 00:32:10,752
President Guo.

828
00:32:12,712 --> 00:32:13,353
The last sentence.

829
00:32:15,593 --> 00:32:16,992
Lu Xiao Bei asked me to tell you.

830
00:32:17,472 --> 00:32:19,432
When everyone rejected them,

831
00:32:19,553 --> 00:32:20,752
Only you took them in.

832
00:32:21,992 --> 00:32:23,153
Let me thank you.

833
00:32:25,353 --> 00:32:25,712
Sorry to bother you.

834
00:32:31,472 --> 00:32:32,313
Wait a second.

835
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:35,633
I'll get the computer back for you.

836
00:32:35,793 --> 00:32:36,672
But the balance,

837
00:32:36,873 --> 00:32:38,232
You must call her as soon as possible.

838
00:32:39,512 --> 00:32:40,593
No problem.

839
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:42,032
Thank you, President Guo.

840
00:32:42,272 --> 00:32:44,472
This is the only thing an e-sports veteran can do.

841
00:32:44,873 --> 00:32:45,873
Let them fight.

842
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:48,032
Thank you

843
00:32:50,073 --> 00:32:51,272
Little Chu Ge is great.

844
00:32:51,992 --> 00:32:52,432
Xiaobei

845
00:32:52,793 --> 00:32:54,952
There's a company interested in Investment Team.

846
00:32:55,113 --> 00:32:56,712
I have an appointment with them, Mr. Huo, at 2 pm.

847
00:32:57,032 --> 00:32:58,593
But they want the captain to go with them.

848
00:32:59,712 --> 00:33:00,873
We have training later.

849
00:33:01,153 --> 00:33:01,672
Another day.

850
00:33:04,353 --> 00:33:04,793
Are you ready?

851
00:33:06,232 --> 00:33:07,512
Mr. Huo is very busy.

852
00:33:07,512 --> 00:33:08,873
I finally made the appointment.

853
00:33:12,153 --> 00:33:12,553
No way

854
00:33:13,712 --> 00:33:14,512
There's a game tomorrow.

855
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:16,793
I must finish the map this afternoon.

856
00:33:17,393 --> 00:33:18,593
Run and run.

857
00:33:18,873 --> 00:33:19,793
Then,

858
00:33:20,393 --> 00:33:21,633
Can we run after the meeting?

859
00:33:22,073 --> 00:33:23,232
Xiao Bei, why don't you go there?

860
00:33:23,232 --> 00:33:24,593
It won't take long.

861
00:33:25,113 --> 00:33:26,593
The pre-match training is necessary.

862
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:27,833
If a team

863
00:33:28,192 --> 00:33:30,153
You can give up the most important training.

864
00:33:30,393 --> 00:33:31,232
I think this team

865
00:33:31,232 --> 00:33:32,752
Without the necessity and value of being invested.

866
00:33:33,593 --> 00:33:34,472
Come on.

867
00:33:36,393 --> 00:33:36,992
Chu song

868
00:33:37,232 --> 00:33:39,113
You know how Xiao Bei is.

869
00:33:39,113 --> 00:33:40,272
Stubborn and stubborn.

870
00:33:40,272 --> 00:33:41,032
Don't worry.

871
00:33:41,393 --> 00:33:42,032
Why don't you

872
00:33:42,032 --> 00:33:43,952
Find a way to change the time with them.

873
00:33:46,472 --> 00:33:47,113
I'll go myself.

874
00:33:47,432 --> 00:33:48,512
I can't stand her up.

875
00:33:57,113 --> 00:33:57,553
Hello

876
00:33:57,833 --> 00:33:59,712
I'm the leader of the Continuing Team.

877
00:33:59,712 --> 00:34:00,432
I'm Chu Ge.

878
00:34:00,633 --> 00:34:01,472
I'm looking for President Huo.

879
00:34:01,793 --> 00:34:02,952
Please wait a moment.

880
00:34:04,313 --> 00:34:05,113
Hello, Mr. Huo.

881
00:34:05,113 --> 00:34:07,553
The leader of the Go On Team came to see you.

882
00:34:08,113 --> 00:34:08,952
Okay, I got it.

883
00:34:10,793 --> 00:34:11,232
sorry

884
00:34:11,232 --> 00:34:11,913
Mr. Huo said that

885
00:34:11,913 --> 00:34:13,553
If the captain of your team doesn't come,

886
00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:14,553
He won't see it.

887
00:34:15,913 --> 00:34:16,432
Thank you

888
00:34:16,672 --> 00:34:17,353
Sorry

889
00:34:22,672 --> 00:34:23,393
Miss Chu,

890
00:34:23,512 --> 00:34:24,793
Miss Chu, you can't go in.

891
00:34:24,873 --> 00:34:25,593
Miss Chu,

892
00:34:27,153 --> 00:34:28,992
Miss Chu, you can't go in.

893
00:34:32,393 --> 00:34:32,793
President Huo.

894
00:34:33,752 --> 00:34:35,512
I'm the leader of the Continuing Team.

895
00:34:35,593 --> 00:34:36,353
My name is Chu Ge.

896
00:34:36,553 --> 00:34:37,032
I'm sorry.

897
00:34:37,032 --> 00:34:37,952
When we first met,

898
00:34:38,313 --> 00:34:39,232
In this way,

899
00:34:40,553 --> 00:34:41,752
But I really have no way.

900
00:34:42,232 --> 00:34:43,752
We agreed to come together.

901
00:34:43,952 --> 00:34:45,752
Why are you the only one here?

902
00:34:48,313 --> 00:34:48,913
sorry

903
00:34:49,432 --> 00:34:50,672
I didn't make an appointment.

904
00:34:51,353 --> 00:34:52,992
Our team has training in the afternoon.

905
00:34:53,192 --> 00:34:54,272
So he couldn't come.

906
00:34:55,432 --> 00:34:56,153
Look.

907
00:34:56,153 --> 00:34:58,313
Can we talk directly today?

908
00:34:58,672 --> 00:34:59,752
Let's meet another day.

909
00:35:08,593 --> 00:35:10,353
I have left time for you today.

910
00:35:10,873 --> 00:35:12,032
There's a game tomorrow.

911
00:35:12,113 --> 00:35:13,873
So he insisted on finishing the map this afternoon.

912
00:35:13,873 --> 00:35:14,793
Running the map is important.

913
00:35:14,793 --> 00:35:15,913
It's important to invest.

914
00:35:24,553 --> 00:35:25,272
Xiao Bei said that

915
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:26,793
If a team

916
00:35:27,073 --> 00:35:28,752
Even before the competition,

917
00:35:29,432 --> 00:35:30,153
Then this team

918
00:35:30,153 --> 00:35:31,593
Without the necessity and value of investment,

919
00:35:34,553 --> 00:35:35,992
You think I don't understand e-sports?

920
00:35:36,553 --> 00:35:36,952
good

921
00:35:37,873 --> 00:35:39,192
Since he didn't come to see me,

922
00:35:39,672 --> 00:35:40,553
I'll go find him.

923
00:35:41,512 --> 00:35:42,793
Watch out for the roof.

924
00:35:44,353 --> 00:35:44,873
One off.

925
00:35:44,992 --> 00:35:45,393
I'll get the box.

926
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,032
Wang Kai, slow down.

927
00:35:46,032 --> 00:35:46,913
Order mine first.

928
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:49,672
There's a thief in the house.

929
00:35:49,672 --> 00:35:50,512
I'll clean it up.

930
00:35:51,313 --> 00:35:52,593
Be careful. It's dark.

931
00:35:52,672 --> 00:35:53,593
There are two byways.

932
00:35:53,593 --> 00:35:54,272
One off.

933
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:55,432
Two on the right.

934
00:35:55,432 --> 00:35:56,393
Watch your back. Watch the back.

935
00:35:56,393 --> 00:35:57,393
Slow down.

936
00:35:57,593 --> 00:35:58,512
Wang Kai, hurry up.

937
00:35:59,672 --> 00:36:00,833
This is Lu Xiao Bei.

938
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:01,313
I'll get him.

939
00:36:01,313 --> 00:36:02,593
I'll throw a flash. Let's go together.

940
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:03,073
good

941
00:36:03,073 --> 00:36:04,073
It's white. Go.

942
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:05,712
That's a good gun.

943
00:36:18,192 --> 00:36:19,032
Cheng Hao, search the place.

944
00:36:19,032 --> 00:36:19,712
Nezha on the box.

945
00:36:19,712 --> 00:36:20,032
Received

946
00:36:20,032 --> 00:36:20,793
Wang Kai S + 1

947
00:36:20,793 --> 00:36:21,393
Outflank him.

948
00:37:05,273 --> 00:37:05,952
young man

949
00:37:06,353 --> 00:37:07,552
You're too blind.

950
00:37:07,753 --> 00:37:09,552
At least I'm a potential investor.

951
00:37:09,873 --> 00:37:11,393
Are you the President Huo that Chuge said?

952
00:37:11,913 --> 00:37:12,673
I'm Lu Xiao Bei.

953
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:13,753
nice to meet you

954
00:37:14,552 --> 00:37:15,592
Gun, gun. Head shot.

955
00:37:16,393 --> 00:37:17,512
I won't give you any noodles.

956
00:37:18,072 --> 00:37:19,273
Play games with water.

957
00:37:19,632 --> 00:37:20,713
Then I won't give you face.

958
00:37:21,952 --> 00:37:22,432
Also

959
00:37:22,753 --> 00:37:23,793
I like your personality.

960
00:37:24,913 --> 00:37:25,793
actually

961
00:37:26,472 --> 00:37:27,913
It's not cost-effective to invest in us.

962
00:37:28,793 --> 00:37:29,512
No one believes it.

963
00:37:29,512 --> 00:37:30,873
Teams like the Continuing Team

964
00:37:31,273 --> 00:37:33,313
Can survive in the professional league.

965
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:35,393
Where did you get the confidence?

966
00:37:35,873 --> 00:37:36,833
Haven't you heard of it?

967
00:37:38,032 --> 00:37:39,313
If a man wants to be successful,

968
00:37:40,032 --> 00:37:41,673
You must have some unrealistic confidence.

969
00:37:47,152 --> 00:37:49,273
This sounds familiar.

970
00:37:49,992 --> 00:37:50,913
You must be a post-00s.

971
00:37:51,472 --> 00:37:53,273
Do you know our captain, Xiao Feng?

972
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:56,793
Not only do I know him,

973
00:37:58,112 --> 00:37:58,873
I know you.

974
00:38:01,552 --> 00:38:02,512
The Kirin of the Steel Coin Team.

975
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,632
Let's put off the rest of today.

976
00:38:06,833 --> 00:38:07,472
It's the boss.

977
00:38:12,673 --> 00:38:14,552
Now the e-sports circles are looking for investment.

978
00:38:16,032 --> 00:38:17,112
How dare you stand me up?

979
00:38:18,432 --> 00:38:19,112
You're the first one.

980
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:21,592
We have a game tomorrow.

981
00:38:22,112 --> 00:38:23,193
Pre-match training.

982
00:38:23,512 --> 00:38:24,353
Can't be changed.

983
00:38:26,313 --> 00:38:27,992
You and Xiao Feng are similar.

984
00:38:28,592 --> 00:38:29,512
To be nice,

985
00:38:29,673 --> 00:38:30,713
This is called persistence.

986
00:38:31,793 --> 00:38:32,913
It's hard to say.

987
00:38:32,913 --> 00:38:33,873
You are stubborn.

988
00:38:36,952 --> 00:38:38,273
If it weren't for his stubbornness,

989
00:38:38,793 --> 00:38:40,032
Your team won't be reorganized.

990
00:38:40,393 --> 00:38:41,112
later

991
00:38:41,512 --> 00:38:42,952
You won't be the national champion.

992
00:38:43,472 --> 00:38:44,193
yes

993
00:38:44,873 --> 00:38:45,833
Without him,

994
00:38:46,873 --> 00:38:48,592
I don't know where to live now.

995
00:38:49,112 --> 00:38:49,913
estimate

996
00:38:50,432 --> 00:38:51,913
Continue to be a webmaster in the internet café.

997
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:54,753
At that time,

998
00:38:54,873 --> 00:38:56,432
You're the one who loves fighting.

999
00:38:57,353 --> 00:38:57,952
later

1000
00:38:58,112 --> 00:38:59,393
And stole Chang Sha's girlfriend.

1001
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:00,552
Because of this,

1002
00:39:00,952 --> 00:39:02,353
You left the team for a while.

1003
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:03,673
When you were young,

1004
00:39:03,673 --> 00:39:04,952
I haven't done anything stupid.

1005
00:39:06,873 --> 00:39:07,552
But luckily,

1006
00:39:08,233 --> 00:39:09,472
Then you went back to the team.

1007
00:39:09,913 --> 00:39:11,032
You don't care about the past.

1008
00:39:11,393 --> 00:39:12,193
Continue to compete.

1009
00:39:12,432 --> 00:39:14,193
How did you know all this?

1010
00:39:15,873 --> 00:39:17,273
Xiao Feng told me himself.

1011
00:39:22,552 --> 00:39:24,552
It was more than ten years ago.

1012
00:39:25,353 --> 00:39:26,512
How old were you then?

1013
00:39:27,753 --> 00:39:28,273
Seven years old.

1014
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:29,793
Seven years old.

1015
00:39:31,432 --> 00:39:33,193
How did you know Xiao Feng?

1016
00:39:34,432 --> 00:39:35,152
we

1017
00:39:36,632 --> 00:39:38,313
On a transport ship crossing the line of fire.

1018
00:39:41,032 --> 00:39:42,432
I told you, you probably won't believe it.

1019
00:39:43,112 --> 00:39:44,072
Even now,

1020
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:46,512
Sometimes I remember

1021
00:39:48,873 --> 00:39:50,313
It's like a dream.

1022
00:39:51,193 --> 00:39:51,952
He and I

1023
00:39:52,992 --> 00:39:54,472
We met in the game last year.

1024
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:56,313
He's still in 2008.

1025
00:39:56,713 --> 00:39:57,793
In 2009,

1026
00:39:58,992 --> 00:40:00,393
We spent a long time

1027
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,632
And trust each other.

1028
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:03,233
In different time and space,

1029
00:40:05,072 --> 00:40:06,873
He told me so many stories about you.

1030
00:40:07,353 --> 00:40:08,833
Ming was caught in the center of Internet addiction.

1031
00:40:12,793 --> 00:40:15,032
Seven of you are in a hotel.

1032
00:40:19,273 --> 00:40:20,992
Only An Lan will sleep in the bed.

1033
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:25,592
And I can't finish it.

1034
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:26,393
Instant Noodles

1035
00:40:27,233 --> 00:40:28,472
That was our first sponsor.

1036
00:40:28,512 --> 00:40:29,393
Hurry up.

1037
00:40:29,673 --> 00:40:30,233
It's stiff.

1038
00:40:30,432 --> 00:40:30,833
one

1039
00:40:31,032 --> 00:40:31,512
two

1040
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:32,193
three

1041
00:40:32,393 --> 00:40:32,873
laugh

1042
00:40:39,472 --> 00:40:40,233
I don't believe it.

1043
00:40:42,152 --> 00:40:43,072
Eleven years ago,

1044
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,952
Ask An Lan to stop the accident.

1045
00:40:49,992 --> 00:40:50,432
It's me.

1046
00:40:52,193 --> 00:40:52,753
AnLuan

1047
00:40:53,112 --> 00:40:54,313
How did you know something was going to happen?

1048
00:40:54,673 --> 00:40:56,432
A friend of Xiao Feng told me.

1049
00:40:56,432 --> 00:40:57,353
Not a friend.

1050
00:40:57,873 --> 00:40:59,193
Friends in the game.

1051
00:40:59,233 --> 00:41:01,393
I don't know her name.

1052
00:41:12,793 --> 00:41:13,833
No wonder

1053
00:41:14,393 --> 00:41:16,472
Before we went to Shenzhen,

1054
00:41:17,592 --> 00:41:19,393
Xiao Feng had to beg and beg.

1055
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:21,233
Hold his broken host.

1056
00:41:22,393 --> 00:41:24,353
Your broken video card should be thrown away.

1057
00:41:24,393 --> 00:41:25,393
Turn that fan.

1058
00:41:25,393 --> 00:41:26,512
Louder than that tractor.

1059
00:41:26,512 --> 00:41:27,632
Why are you carrying it?

1060
00:41:27,632 --> 00:41:28,273
He insisted that

1061
00:41:28,432 --> 00:41:29,353
You don't understand.

1062
00:41:29,632 --> 00:41:31,112
The host is amazing.

1063
00:41:31,952 --> 00:41:32,753
Can travel through time and space.

1064
00:41:33,552 --> 00:41:35,353
Why don't you take you to the sky?

1065
00:41:35,512 --> 00:41:36,512
I didn't believe it then.

1066
00:41:37,512 --> 00:41:38,112
He also said that

1067
00:41:38,393 --> 00:41:39,673
There is a fortune teller who is very accurate.

1068
00:41:39,913 --> 00:41:41,193
Saying that we can win the national championship.

1069
00:41:41,512 --> 00:41:42,393
It turns out that person

1070
00:41:45,793 --> 00:41:46,592
unfortunately

1071
00:41:47,152 --> 00:41:48,313
He's still in the hospital.

1072
00:41:50,432 --> 00:41:51,432
Give me a break.

1073
00:41:52,913 --> 00:41:54,152
This is incredible.

1074
00:42:01,313 --> 00:42:02,393
I've been thinking about

1075
00:42:03,673 --> 00:42:05,673
Do we have a chance to save him?

1076
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,072
The doctor said

1077
00:42:08,873 --> 00:42:10,112
His body is still there.

1078
00:42:11,072 --> 00:42:12,313
But I don't know where I went.

1079
00:42:13,592 --> 00:42:15,072
He had an accident in the game.

1080
00:42:16,432 --> 00:42:17,233
If you lose your consciousness,

1081
00:42:17,233 --> 00:42:18,632
It can only be in one place.

1082
00:42:20,552 --> 00:42:21,673
In the game,

1083
00:42:24,072 --> 00:42:25,432
So you mean

1084
00:42:25,873 --> 00:42:27,592
If we can find the equipment,

1085
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:28,512
We can

1086
00:42:28,992 --> 00:42:30,393
To get his consciousness back.

1087
00:42:30,992 --> 00:42:31,873
That's possible.

1088
00:42:32,673 --> 00:42:33,673
With the game data,

1089
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:34,952
To stimulate his brain.

1090
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:36,233
It might actually work.

1091
00:42:38,873 --> 00:42:40,592
It's too sci-fi.

1092
00:42:41,112 --> 00:42:42,632
But I think we can give it a try.

1093
00:42:43,753 --> 00:42:45,273
I found him many famous doctors.

1094
00:42:45,913 --> 00:42:47,233
And tried many methods.

1095
00:42:47,432 --> 00:42:48,552
But nothing can help.

1096
00:42:50,273 --> 00:42:51,353
Why don't we just

1097
00:42:51,353 --> 00:42:53,152
A dead horse, a living doctor.

1098
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:54,793
The premise is that

1099
00:42:55,313 --> 00:42:56,753
To retrieve that device,

1100
00:42:58,552 --> 00:42:59,472
Don't worry.

1101
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:02,193
As long as this device is still here,

1102
00:43:02,952 --> 00:43:04,313
I have the ability to get it.

1103
00:43:04,552 --> 00:43:05,992
Even if it's only possible,

1104
00:43:07,713 --> 00:43:08,793
I still want to save him.

1105
00:43:09,632 --> 00:43:10,833
If a man wants to be successful,

1106
00:43:11,313 --> 00:43:13,472
You have to have some unrealistic confidence.

1107
00:43:19,512 --> 00:43:20,552
It's not closed.

1108
00:43:20,552 --> 00:43:22,393
Are the debt collectors here?

1109
00:43:24,673 --> 00:43:25,592
These bastards.

1110
00:43:25,713 --> 00:43:26,873
If you don't let us live,

1111
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:33,393
Brothers!

1112
00:43:34,233 --> 00:43:35,032
What are you doing?

1113
00:43:35,273 --> 00:43:35,913
Delivery

1114
00:43:35,952 --> 00:43:36,913
Who asked you to send it?

1115
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:38,112
We're a city logistics company.

1116
00:43:38,193 --> 00:43:39,233
The company just sent the order.

1117
00:43:48,032 --> 00:43:48,913
The leader of Little Chu.

1118
00:43:48,913 --> 00:43:49,592
What happened

1119
00:43:51,673 --> 00:43:52,152
Sign it.

1120
00:43:52,673 --> 00:43:54,032
The investment contract has been signed.

1121
00:43:54,313 --> 00:43:56,552
This is our new training equipment.

1122
00:43:56,673 --> 00:43:58,353
There will be new uniforms in two days.

1123
00:43:59,393 --> 00:44:00,393
President Huo has told us.

1124
00:44:00,393 --> 00:44:01,753
As long as there's gravitational equipment,

1125
00:44:01,753 --> 00:44:02,632
We all have them.

1126
00:44:04,152 --> 00:44:05,753
We have a father.

1127
00:44:07,713 --> 00:44:08,992
Thanks, dad.

1128
00:44:11,913 --> 00:44:12,592
Xiaobei

1129
00:44:12,873 --> 00:44:13,753
Xiaobei

1130
00:44:15,112 --> 00:44:16,353
I have diarrhea.

1131
00:44:58,032 --> 00:44:58,873
My AK.

1132
00:44:59,193 --> 00:45:00,393
The host I want the most

1133
00:45:02,432 --> 00:45:03,112
Good gracious!

1134
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:04,112
This is not the latest model.

1135
00:45:04,112 --> 00:45:05,753
The projector of Gao Qing?

1136
00:45:08,952 --> 00:45:09,793
That's amazing.

1137
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:13,313
Thank you

1138
00:45:14,673 --> 00:45:15,112
you're welcome

1139
00:45:16,552 --> 00:45:17,873
Everyone has new equipment.

1140
00:45:18,393 --> 00:45:19,233
I can't live without you.

1141
00:45:19,873 --> 00:45:20,393
Why?

1142
00:45:20,753 --> 00:45:21,913
I don't need any new equipment.

1143
00:45:23,072 --> 00:45:23,713
Who said that?

1144
00:45:30,913 --> 00:45:32,072
Wearing this bracelet,

1145
00:45:32,632 --> 00:45:33,952
Sheng is the leader of our team.

1146
00:45:34,313 --> 00:45:34,753
die

1147
00:45:35,952 --> 00:45:37,313
Is the dead leader of our team.

1148
00:46:34,233 --> 00:46:37,713
The 9286th game failed.

1149
00:46:37,713 --> 00:46:40,032
The game data will be reset.

1150
00:46:40,193 --> 00:46:42,472
Please be prepared.

1151
00:46:42,952 --> 00:46:45,193
And start the challenge again.
