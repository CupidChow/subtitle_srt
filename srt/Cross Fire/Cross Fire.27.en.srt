1
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:33,440
As I said before,

2
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,559
There's a game company.

3
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:38,639
To do the equipment test.

4
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:40,360
You can give me some money.

5
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,280
The money is here.

6
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,359
I will compensate the families of the deceased.

7
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:47,920
Then I'll turn myself in.

8
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,519
You might be able to

9
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:51,959
Judge lightly.

10
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,879
Make an appointment with the company tomorrow.

11
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:03,080
There's some money in the card.

12
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,839
To the family.

13
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:51,919
Xiao Feng.

14
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,439
Brothers!

15
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,839
I'm looking for An Lan.

16
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,319
I have something urgent to talk to An Lan.

17
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,759
Can you help me contact her?

18
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:57,640
Please register at the front desk.

19
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:01,960
AnLuan

20
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:02,680
Sir, don't do that.

21
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,599
An Lan, where are you?

22
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:04,319
Security Guard

23
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,039
AnLuan

24
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:08,559
Chu song

25
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:09,240
It's okay, my friend.

26
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,999
Where is An Lan?

27
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,159
Why are you here?

28
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:11,999
Chu Ge told me

29
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:12,879
Where is An Lan?

30
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,039
I called her office number.

31
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:14,960
She hasn't answered.

32
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,759
What's wrong?

33
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,839
She's having a regular meeting with the supervisor.

34
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,599
It's going to be a while.

35
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,319
Which conference room is she in?

36
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:21,920
Chu song

37
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,319
Is really special.

38
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,120
Something very important.

39
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,159
Tell me where she is.

40
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:25,559
you

41
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,719
You can't get into her meeting.

42
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:30,480
Xiaobei

43
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:31,759
Lu Xiao Bei,

44
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,640
Come back.

45
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,360
This time, we are facing all game users.

46
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,559
The concept of gamer is coming soon.

47
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:40,920
We hope

48
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,079
The positive spiritual values of gamers

49
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:45,240
To every user of the game.

50
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,519
And encourage them

51
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:49,040
AnLuan

52
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,399
I have something to ask you.

53
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,439
Can you come out?

54
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,480
Bring the visitors to the meeting room.

55
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,759
After my meeting.

56
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,319
It's about Xiao Feng.

57
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,439
Who are you

58
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,759
Xiao Feng's death.

59
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,759
How do you know that?

60
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,759
It doesn't matter.

61
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,040
You need to tell me how Xiao Feng died.

62
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,360
And the specific time of death.

63
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,439
What time is it?

64
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,920
It's been a long time.

65
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,720
I don't want to mention it.

66
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,319
You didn't tell me.

67
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,360
I can find out.

68
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,120
But you will lose forever.

69
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,160
To see him again.

70
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:21,879
If I see him again,

71
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,199
I want to save Xiao Feng.

72
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,160
I can bring him back to life.

73
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,879
I don't know what nonsense you are talking about,

74
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,959
But thank you very much.

75
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,800
More than ten years have passed.

76
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,160
Someone cares about him so much.

77
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,600
Today is the anniversary of his death.

78
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,199
I can contact Xiao Feng in 2009.

79
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,280
I might be able to save him.

80
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,480
AnLuan

81
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,399
what are you doing?

82
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,920
Do you have any paper? Lend me some.

83
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:05,759
to wait a moment

84
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,759
You don't have to pay it back.

85
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,680
This is so ordinary.

86
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,680
Do you have a pattern?

87
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,040
The pattern is unique.

88
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,759
No

89
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,319
My family is not a supermarket.

90
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,720
Do you have an envelope?

91
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,840
You want the envelope?

92
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,879
What are you doing?

93
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,040
Urgent business

94
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,800
I'm writing a very important letter.

95
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:26,639
to wait a moment

96
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,759
There's no envelope.

97
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,040
This is unique.

98
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:35,680
It's for you.

99
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,079
As long as you tell me,

100
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,639
The cause of Xiao Feng's death

101
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,199
Place of death, time of death

102
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,840
I might be able to save him.

103
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,160
It won't hurt you to tell me.

104
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,999
Don't you think so?

105
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,600
Eleven years ago today,

106
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:10,199
Xiao Feng went to a

107
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:12,360
The game company's device experience event.

108
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,079
But during the experience,

109
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:16,600
There's a problem with the equipment.

110
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,800
Xiao Feng.

111
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,160
Died in the accident.

112
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,999
I need to know more details.

113
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:26,120
The more the better.

114
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,600
Xiao Feng went with Xu Wei that day.

115
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,999
Before he left,

116
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,800
And promised to wait for him.

117
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,160
To take me to his favorite restaurant.

118
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:48,759
But in the end, I came.

119
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,600
But the phone number of the game company.

120
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,999
When I get there,

121
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,840
He's gone.

122
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,199
AnLuan

123
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:19,720
sorry

124
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:21,920
I didn't take care of him.

125
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,079
What happened at that time?

126
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:29,759
at that time

127
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:32,040
We went in together.

128
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,199
The game is very exciting and fun.

129
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,280
then

130
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,800
Suddenly I can't get the signal from the outside.

131
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,199
Our blood volume began to drop rapidly.

132
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:43,519
then

133
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,720
There are many mercenaries charging towards us.

134
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,360
It's just a game.

135
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,600
How could it be?

136
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,720
I don't know either

137
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:55,879
The area in the game is weird.

138
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,079
We got separated.

139
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:58,399
I can't contact anyone.

140
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,240
The game equipment

141
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,679
There's a serious problem.

142
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,360
For a long time.

143
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,399
The patient has a large scar on his chest.

144
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,279
The patient's heart and nervous system

145
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,639
May have suffered great trauma.

146
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:13,679
Immediately.

147
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,159
understand

148
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,879
The patient died after emergency treatment.

149
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,879
Time of death

150
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:46,759
Last revision date: October 31, 2009

151
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,240
7: 27 p.m.

152
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:51,879
How could it be like this?

153
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,080
Is no one responsible?

154
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,039
The game company wants to block the news.

155
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,440
And proposed compensation terms.

156
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,720
We were angry.

157
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,399
But we considered

158
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,120
The actual situation of Xiao Feng's family

159
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,279
His parents are very old.

160
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:07,279
And no one to support her in the future.

161
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:08,799
And before he experienced it,

162
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:11,159
Signed a very bad agreement for him.

163
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
Finally, we agreed.

164
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:15,759
Do you still remember

165
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,840
Xiao Feng is a matter of time.

166
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,480
When I came to the game company,

167
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:24,080
It's 3 pm.

168
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,039
Did anyone in Xiao Feng's family

169
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,560
I've been waiting for him at home.

170
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:46,480
Xiaobei

171
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,240
What can I do for you?

172
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:49,799
Lu Xiao Bei,

173
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:04,999
Brothers!

174
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:05,999
Sorry

175
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,440
Let me go first.

176
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:08,120
I have something urgent.

177
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,799
What are you doing?

178
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,159
What kind of person is this?

179
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:10,560
Master worker

180
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,679
Big A.

181
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:19,759
Xiaobei

182
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,200
I've developed a set of tactics.

183
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,480
Is very suitable for us.

184
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,480
I'm busy now.

185
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,240
Answer it.

186
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,879
Answer it.

187
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,679
Pick it up.

188
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,080
Answer it.

189
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,519
Answer it.

190
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,240
Answer it.

191
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,519
Answer it.

192
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:54,440
Don't.

193
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:04,519
feed

194
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:05,759
AnLuan

195
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,519
Can you hear me?

196
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,039
AnLuan

197
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,360
An Lan, is that you?

198
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,080
AnLuan

199
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,840
Who are you

200
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,720
Don't care who I am.

201
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:18,200
Xiao Feng, where is he now?

202
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:19,639
He went out.

203
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,039
What's wrong?

204
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,919
Is he...

205
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,879
To participate in the equipment experience of a game company.

206
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:25,560
How do you know?

207
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:26,919
Stop him!

208
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,240
Don't let him go.

209
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,039
why

210
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,879
because

211
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,080
Because there will be an accident.

212
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,560
Xiao Feng will die.

213
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,519
What are you talking about?

214
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:37,480
I'm not lying.

215
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:39,240
The equipment of the game company

216
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,960
There are serious security risks.

217
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,039
Who are you?

218
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,480
Don't care who I am.

219
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,519
There's no time to explain.

220
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,919
Just do as I say, okay?

221
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:51,840
Monkey, right?

222
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:54,519
You almost fooled me.

223
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,960
If you don't want Xiao Feng to die,

224
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,440
Just do as I say.

225
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,200
But Xiao Feng is fine.

226
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,720
Xu Wei was with him.

227
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,279
What will happen?

228
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,440
Besides,

229
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:10,999
You won't tell me who you are.

230
00:15:10,999 --> 00:15:12,279
Why should I believe you?

231
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,759
AnLuan

232
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,320
Before Xiao Feng left,

233
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,120
I promised you

234
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,240
When he comes back,

235
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:29,960
So he took you to that restaurant.

236
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,480
The noodle restaurant he likes very much.

237
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:34,720
you

238
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,879
How did you know?

239
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,639
If you don't want that,

240
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,919
To be his last words to you.

241
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,320
Just do as I say.

242
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:42,320
Stop him.

243
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,560
Stop the test.

244
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,600
Go now.

245
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:46,159
He will die.

246
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,480
Go.

247
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,879
Okay, I'll go now.

248
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,919
You must survive.

249
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:12,480
Sign it. It's done.

250
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,399
Mr. Xu has come to experience it before.

251
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:15,759
There are some things to be aware of.

252
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,360
I've told him everything before.

253
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,279
Let's go and experience it.

254
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,600
We have something to do next.

255
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,039
OK

256
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:23,360
please

257
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:29,960
Name date.

258
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:49,360
taxi

259
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,120
Welcome to our lab.

260
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:06,759
Please sit down.

261
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,519
Please sit down.

262
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,519
This is the consciousness chip of the game.

263
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:12,840
It will be different

264
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,039
The positioning and receiving device behind it.

265
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,560
Record your status in real time.

266
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,399
Make sure it's safe.

267
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,720
So that we can

268
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,639
To send you

269
00:17:21,639 --> 00:17:23,519
To recall the real world safely.

270
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:24,919
Then our game experience

271
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,039
From now on,

272
00:17:56,919 --> 00:17:58,560
Enjoy the game.

273
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,279
Please protect the receiver behind.

274
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,200
We'll monitor it in real time.

275
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,080
All your data and information

276
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:08,799
This game is good.

277
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,519
How is it? Is it real?

278
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:11,039
this

279
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,039
The game equipment is cool.

280
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,399
Introduce her to me.

281
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:14,960
How about this?

282
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:16,799
Beat more people later.

283
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,440
Earn more gold coins to buy equipment.

284
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:19,639
What is this for?

285
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,999
You have to figure it out.

286
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:26,720
This motorcycle is handsome.

287
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,159
Let me see.

288
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,200
It's a pity that I can't ride it.

289
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:31,440
Don't worry. Practice more.

290
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:36,560
Someone is coming.

291
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,159
Hide.

292
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,200
How can I fight without a gun?

293
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:43,440
Learn from it.

294
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:49,120
Next

295
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,519
This gun is cool.

296
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:03,799
behind

297
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:17,279
Lieutenant

298
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,720
This game can

299
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,519
It's real.

300
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,519
Isn't it good?

301
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:21,399
There's a blood bag in front.

302
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:22,120
I'll cover you.

303
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:22,720
go

304
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:35,199
Xiao Feng.

305
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:36,040
Go.

306
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,080
Xiao Feng.

307
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:11,040
I'm out of bullets. Help me.

308
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,159
good

309
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,719
Lieutenant

310
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,239
Players enter the unknown area.

311
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:26,679
Mr. Xu's location has disappeared.

312
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:29,120
Lieutenant

313
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:39,840
curse it!

314
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,479
Both of them have disappeared.

315
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:50,800
What are we going to do now?

316
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,239
Mr. Xu,

317
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,320
Can you hear me?

318
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,719
Get out of there.

319
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,600
Please answer.

320
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,919
Mr. Xu,

321
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,840
Captain, are you crazy?

322
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,560
Stop it. Help me.

323
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,520
I deliberately led you here.

324
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,320
And I don't want you to go out.

325
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,560
Do you know why I killed that bastard?

326
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,360
On the day of Ning Jiang Team's semi-final,

327
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,399
I hit someone with my car.

328
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:27,520
He got rid of the car for me.

329
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,399
good

330
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,560
thing

331
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,399
Don't worry.

332
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:39,639
My plug-in is easy to use.

333
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:45,479
feed

334
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,239
feed

335
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:47,520
Xiao Feng can't be reached.

336
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,040
Where are you?

337
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,360
We're almost there. Don't rush.

338
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,679
You killed Lu Xiaonan.

339
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,679
that's right

340
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:07,360
Their vital signs dropped rapidly.

341
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,479
It's recommended to enable mandatory logoff.

342
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:09,399
Mr. Xu,

343
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,959
Can you pull out?

344
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,360
Please answer.

345
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,040
Please answer.

346
00:23:13,879 --> 00:23:15,399
Something happened in the game.

347
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,719
Stop the game.

348
00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:21,639
Xiao Feng.

349
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:23,439
Stop yelling.

350
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:25,239
It's useless. They can't hear you.

351
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,840
Lieutenant

352
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,080
It's not too late to turn back now.

353
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:34,280
A game is a game.

354
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,399
The reality is the reality.

355
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:38,600
Don't mix together.

356
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,520
You can start over if you lose the game.

357
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,959
The reality is nothing if you lose.

358
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,679
Xiao Feng, I can't lose.

359
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,320
I won't lose.

360
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,760
Lieutenant

361
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,239
Life is nothing but winning and losing.

362
00:23:52,879 --> 00:23:53,959
And right and wrong.

363
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:56,399
Winning is right and losing is wrong.

364
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,600
Kind people are always the most pitiful.

365
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,280
Just like you now.

366
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:03,239
Their vital signs

367
00:24:03,239 --> 00:24:04,360
Will disappear within a few minutes.

368
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,840
It's recommended to enable mandatory logoff.

369
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:08,919
Xiao Feng.

370
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:10,560
Xiao Feng.

371
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:12,159
Xiao Feng, Xu Wei, come back.

372
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,000
Xiao Feng.

373
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,399
Xiao Feng, Xu Wei, can you hear me?

374
00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:17,320
Xiao Feng, Xu Wei, come back.

375
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,080
If you don't come back, you will die.

376
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,320
Do you hear me? I'll be right back.

377
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,159
Xiao Feng, you will die if you don't come back.

378
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,800
Xiao Feng.

379
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:44,479
Lieutenant

380
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,600
Save me.

381
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,479
It's all my fault.

382
00:24:51,719 --> 00:24:53,080
It has nothing to do with Xiao Feng.

383
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,239
What's your relationship with him?

384
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:55,199
We are brothers.

385
00:24:58,439 --> 00:24:59,320
I'm Xiao Feng.

386
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:00,879
Without you, Xu Wei,

387
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,199
You are the most important person in my life.

388
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,439
Xiao Feng.

389
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,520
Why did you force me to surrender?

390
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:21,840
I really can't lose.

391
00:25:38,719 --> 00:25:39,600
I'm afraid we can't wait any longer.

392
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,000
We must initiate a mandatory offline.

393
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,280
At least it can ensure their safety.

394
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:45,520
Stop the game.

395
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,639
They will die.

396
00:25:52,639 --> 00:25:53,520
Don't hesitate.

397
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:00,639
Xiao Feng.

398
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,520
Xiao Feng.

399
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,439
Xiao Feng.

400
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:05,159
Xiao Feng.

401
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,560
Xiao Feng.

402
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,280
Mr. Xu,

403
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:08,320
How are you?

404
00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:10,399
What's wrong with you, Xiao Feng?

405
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:11,439
Xiao Feng, can you hear me?

406
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:12,040
Call an ambulance.

407
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,479
Xiao Feng, wake up.

408
00:26:13,479 --> 00:26:14,040
Xiao Feng.

409
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:34,719
The patient has a large scar on his chest.

410
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,800
The patient's heart and nervous system

411
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,080
May have suffered great trauma.

412
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,159
Immediately.

413
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:39,800
understand

414
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,280
The patient's heart rate has recovered.

415
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,919
Is in a deep coma.

416
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,199
No response to external stimulation.

417
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:04,399
Last revision date: October 31, 2009

418
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:05,439
6: 27 p.m.

419
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,239
The patient is in a vegetative state.

420
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,239
Inform the family.

421
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,399
north

422
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,239
You locked yourself in the room for a whole night.

423
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:33,479
What happened?

424
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:50,199
sorry

425
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,199
The subscriber you dialed is temporarily unavailable.

426
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,600
Please dial later.

427
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,399
sorry

428
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,399
The subscriber you dialed is temporarily unavailable.

429
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,800
Please dial later.

430
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,439
hello

431
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,600
Where is Xiao Feng's gravestone?

432
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,159
Who is it?

433
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,120
Xiao Feng.

434
00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:00,600
This position?

435
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,479
Yes

436
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:03,520
I've been working here for more than ten years.

437
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,360
This place is always empty.

438
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,560
Empty

439
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,600
impossible

440
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:08,800
I

441
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,959
I came here two days ago.

442
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,560
What's your name? Say it again.

443
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,800
Xiao Feng, the Chinese zodiac animal.

444
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,639
Maple leaves.

445
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,239
sorry

446
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,360
The deceased

447
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,080
Has not been registered with us.

448
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:24,120
How could it be?

449
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,320
Our software is correct.

450
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,399
Unless he's not buried here.

451
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:48,080
Hello, An Lan.

452
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,280
I'm Lu Xiao Bei.

453
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,360
What's the matter

454
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:51,879
I'm in Songshan Cemetery.

455
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,760
Why is Xiao Feng's gravestone gone?

456
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,959
What happened?

457
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,760
Speak An Lan.

458
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:58,280
Can you go back to Shenzhen now?

459
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,360
can

460
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,639
But I won't be there until later.

461
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,639
When you come back to Shenzhen, come and see me.

462
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:04,560
I'll take you to a place.

463
00:30:43,479 --> 00:30:44,520
Didn't you go to bed?

464
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,840
I'm up now.

465
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,199
Didn't I say that

466
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:48,320
Staying up late is bad for girls.

467
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:49,320
Don't...

468
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,479
Just give me some Royal Mud Workshop mask.

469
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,360
good

470
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,639
I'll pack your mask.

471
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,120
I didn't see it before.

472
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,639
You used to drink so much.

473
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,600
I'll divide the drinks.

474
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,679
Play a game.

475
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,239
What are you doing?

476
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:20,280
Rock and paper scissors.

477
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:27,399
Rock and paper scissors.

478
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,320
I won.

479
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,280
Drink it.

480
00:31:34,199 --> 00:31:34,639
I'll drink it.

481
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,800
Why don't we play another game?

482
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,320
I can't play this game with you.

483
00:31:46,199 --> 00:31:47,120
Let me show you something wonderful.

484
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,479
That's great.

485
00:32:07,479 --> 00:32:09,159
There's no trouble in the game.

486
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,239
The moon is so beautiful tonight.

487
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,600
What happened

488
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,199
What do you mean?

489
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,520
What?

490
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,439
What happened last night?

491
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,840
Last night

492
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:03,239
Practice.

493
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,479
Practice.

494
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,439
And you brought a lot of wine.

495
00:33:06,879 --> 00:33:07,639
Alcohol/Liquor

496
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:08,840
And drank too much.

497
00:33:09,479 --> 00:33:10,679
You drank too much.

498
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,360
Then what?

499
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,239
And now.

500
00:33:17,439 --> 00:33:19,040
How did we get back to my dorm?

501
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:20,959
Tell me what you remember.

502
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,280
Why are you so fierce?

503
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:24,760
I don't remember.

504
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,159
Then why are we in the same bed?

505
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:29,120
And why are you wearing my pajamas?

506
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:32,479
sorry

507
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:33,000
I'll take it off for you.

508
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:34,439
other

509
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,760
Who is it?

510
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,040
I

511
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,159
And me.

512
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,760
What are you two doing?

513
00:33:43,959 --> 00:33:46,080
Wang Kai hasn't seen anyone all morning.

514
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,000
Do you know where he is?

515
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,719
I don't know.

516
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,439
Aren't these Wang Kai's shoes?

517
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,320
Yes

518
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:58,879
Why are his shoes at your door?

519
00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:00,280
Do you?

520
00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:01,600
He's in your room.

521
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,959
What are you talking about?

522
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,520
I just woke up.

523
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,719
I think it's impossible.

524
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:08,600
Brother Kai,

525
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,919
How could you be in Jiayi's room?

526
00:34:12,479 --> 00:34:13,120
not necessarily

527
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,840
I'll call Wang Kai.

528
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,000
Cellphones /Mobile Phones

529
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,760
Where's your phone?

530
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:23,040
Zha

531
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,879
Did you hear the vibration of the phone?

532
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,600
I don't think so.

533
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:31,360
Let's go find another place.

534
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,159
good

535
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,479
I think

536
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,439
We should

537
00:34:42,439 --> 00:34:43,879
Nothing happened that shouldn't have happened?

538
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:45,679
It's absolutely impossible.

539
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,120
According to the current situation,

540
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,679
It's still possible.

541
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,399
Leave now.

542
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:09,439
You must have been caught.

543
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,600
I think I saw something.

544
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,199
I shouldn't have seen at my age.

545
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,600
To stimulate my brother.

546
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,479
pink

547
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:17,239
Go away

548
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,280
Eleven years ago today,

549
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,879
I stopped the game experience in time.

550
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,919
Although I saved his life,

551
00:35:56,439 --> 00:35:57,719
But he became a vegetable.

552
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,800
And never woke up.
