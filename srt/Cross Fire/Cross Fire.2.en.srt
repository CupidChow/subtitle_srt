1
00:02:59,255 --> 00:02:59,735
Bei.

2
00:03:03,496 --> 00:03:04,216
Come on.

3
00:03:13,496 --> 00:03:14,216
For me?

4
00:03:15,216 --> 00:03:17,255
Don't you always want a new phone?

5
00:03:17,255 --> 00:03:18,216
Don't play in class.

6
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:24,255
There's no locator inside, right?

7
00:03:24,935 --> 00:03:25,536
You don't need

8
00:03:26,736 --> 00:03:27,896
the school's probe,

9
00:03:27,896 --> 00:03:28,896
More than bird nests.

10
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:32,015
It's a waste of money.

11
00:03:33,936 --> 00:03:35,176
As long as you don't play games

12
00:03:35,576 --> 00:03:36,736
and study hard,

13
00:03:36,736 --> 00:03:37,855
In fact, it doesn't matter

14
00:03:37,855 --> 00:03:39,215
whether you get into a famous university or not,

15
00:03:40,296 --> 00:03:41,456
There are many paths in life.

16
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:43,016
Only if you take the right path.

17
00:03:57,656 --> 00:03:59,096
I got it.

18
00:03:59,096 --> 00:04:00,016
Her name is Chuge,

19
00:04:00,016 --> 00:04:01,615
transferred from the High School Attached to Normal University,

20
00:04:01,656 --> 00:04:02,695
He's a sports student.

21
00:04:02,936 --> 00:04:04,255
Mother of No. 1 Middle School and No. 2 Middle School, hooligans from the High School Attached to

22
00:04:04,296 --> 00:04:06,016
Normal University,

23
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,576
I've heard of this female PE student,

24
00:04:07,576 --> 00:04:08,736
who often fights with people,

25
00:04:08,736 --> 00:04:10,096
You even dare to beat a boy in school.

26
00:04:10,456 --> 00:04:11,896
How could such a person be in our class?

27
00:04:11,896 --> 00:04:12,896
Exactly

28
00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:14,016
I'm coming.

29
00:04:14,456 --> 00:04:15,096
Who's here?

30
00:04:15,576 --> 00:04:16,536
The PE student,

31
00:04:17,376 --> 00:04:18,736
I don't care who she is.

32
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:20,376
Give her a lesson first.

33
00:04:21,096 --> 00:04:21,495
Yes.

34
00:04:21,936 --> 00:04:23,376
Let her know

35
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:24,255
who's in charge of this place?

36
00:04:24,576 --> 00:04:25,536
Don't mess around.

37
00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:27,055
Is the front door locked?

38
00:04:27,096 --> 00:04:27,936
It's locked.

39
00:04:27,936 --> 00:04:28,376
Don't worry.

40
00:05:28,736 --> 00:05:29,456
Sorry,

41
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:31,416
the book hurt your leg.

42
00:05:51,176 --> 00:05:52,176
Can you change to another place?

43
00:05:54,495 --> 00:05:55,055
It's none of your business.

44
00:05:55,736 --> 00:05:56,856
If you don't want to sit,

45
00:05:57,016 --> 00:05:58,016
You can move to another seat.

46
00:06:23,456 --> 00:06:23,935
Hey,

47
00:06:24,576 --> 00:06:25,296
Xiao Feng,

48
00:06:25,296 --> 00:06:26,176
our house collapsed,

49
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:27,576
Your dad got hurt.

50
00:06:29,896 --> 00:06:30,736
Chief Commandant.

51
00:06:30,736 --> 00:06:31,495
Why did you go to the hospital

52
00:06:31,495 --> 00:06:32,495
with me?

53
00:06:33,495 --> 00:06:34,976
The house I built in my hometown collapsed.

54
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:35,935
He hurt my dad.

55
00:06:37,335 --> 00:06:38,335
Hurry up.

56
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:39,495
Okay,

57
00:06:39,495 --> 00:06:40,456
I... I won't pull it anymore.

58
00:06:40,456 --> 00:06:41,055
Stop pulling! Let's go!

59
00:06:46,215 --> 00:06:47,335
Come on, raise it a little higher.

60
00:06:50,056 --> 00:06:50,576
Dad,

61
00:06:51,056 --> 00:06:51,696
Are you okay?

62
00:06:51,696 --> 00:06:52,535
Uncle, are you okay?

63
00:06:52,896 --> 00:06:53,896
My leg was broken,

64
00:06:55,175 --> 00:06:57,175
so I almost hit my head by a few centimeters.

65
00:06:57,175 --> 00:06:58,136
Your dad has a good life,

66
00:06:58,136 --> 00:06:59,295
but I have a bad life.

67
00:06:59,496 --> 00:07:00,576
I'm going to smash my head.

68
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:03,056
There's no need to see such a disappointing thing again.

69
00:07:03,376 --> 00:07:04,175
Dad,

70
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:05,616
The construction site is already dangerous,

71
00:07:05,616 --> 00:07:06,816
and it's raining heavily,

72
00:07:06,816 --> 00:07:08,616
Why do you have to rush in?

73
00:07:08,616 --> 00:07:09,696
I didn't know it was dangerous.

74
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,535
Your mom and I have saved half of our lives,

75
00:07:11,936 --> 00:07:13,215
and spent all our money on that house.

76
00:07:13,496 --> 00:07:14,256
Be gentle.

77
00:07:14,256 --> 00:07:15,136
This is a hospital. What's wrong

78
00:07:15,136 --> 00:07:16,095
with not having a house?

79
00:07:16,496 --> 00:07:17,696
We wouldn't have slept on the street.

80
00:07:17,696 --> 00:07:19,936
Half of my leg is in the coffin.

81
00:07:19,936 --> 00:07:20,936
Why do I need a house?

82
00:07:20,936 --> 00:07:22,016
It's all for you.

83
00:07:22,016 --> 00:07:23,616
I didn't ask my family for a house.

84
00:07:23,616 --> 00:07:25,175
You insisted on building this house yourself.

85
00:07:26,136 --> 00:07:27,696
He's already in his 20 s,

86
00:07:27,696 --> 00:07:29,256
and he doesn't even have a serious job.

87
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:30,175
If you don't have a house,

88
00:07:30,175 --> 00:07:31,896
you can't even get a wife from the countryside,

89
00:07:31,896 --> 00:07:33,616
Being single for the rest of my life is my business.

90
00:07:34,256 --> 00:07:35,175
You don't have to worry about it.

91
00:07:35,175 --> 00:07:35,576
-What did you say? -Shut

92
00:07:35,616 --> 00:07:36,376
up.

93
00:07:37,735 --> 00:07:38,136
No, no!

94
00:07:38,136 --> 00:07:38,735
Calm down.

95
00:07:38,735 --> 00:07:39,016
Uncle,

96
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:39,816
the doctor said I wouldn't let you get mad,

97
00:07:39,816 --> 00:07:40,696
So is your child.

98
00:07:40,696 --> 00:07:41,936
Do you think it hurts again?

99
00:07:41,936 --> 00:07:42,496
How can you say that?

100
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:43,696
Didn't your dad do it for your own good?

101
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:44,896
You two boys,

102
00:07:45,136 --> 00:07:45,896
20 years old?

103
00:07:46,056 --> 00:07:47,175
I don't lack arms or legs.

104
00:07:47,616 --> 00:07:48,175
Why don't you do something?

105
00:07:48,576 --> 00:07:50,056
Your dad found you such a good unit,

106
00:07:50,056 --> 00:07:51,056
but you're not going to work?

107
00:07:51,056 --> 00:07:52,056
You insist on playing games all day.

108
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:53,295
I really don't know what's going on in your head.

109
00:07:53,816 --> 00:07:54,295
We

110
00:07:55,256 --> 00:07:56,256
… Your dad is like this,

111
00:07:56,256 --> 00:07:57,496
Can you stop talking?

112
00:08:06,816 --> 00:08:07,456
Xiao Feng,

113
00:08:10,376 --> 00:08:11,456
your dad bought you a bag,

114
00:08:12,136 --> 00:08:14,016
Why should I take this bag?

115
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:15,056
Pretending to be a village committee cadre,

116
00:08:15,816 --> 00:08:17,295
he said it's necessary to find a job.

117
00:08:18,056 --> 00:08:19,136
He slung it on his arm,

118
00:08:19,136 --> 00:08:20,816
like a learned and decent man,

119
00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:22,256
Hang this up and you'll learn.

120
00:08:22,256 --> 00:08:24,056
Then who needs to study and go to college?

121
00:08:24,056 --> 00:08:25,735
This bag suits you.

122
00:08:25,735 --> 00:08:27,576
It's tailor-made for you.

123
00:08:29,256 --> 00:08:30,936
Can you understand something?

124
00:08:30,936 --> 00:08:32,616
Your dad has been so strong all his life,

125
00:08:32,616 --> 00:08:34,295
never falling behind others in anything.

126
00:08:34,936 --> 00:08:35,616
It's fine now.

127
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:37,816
The whole village is watching our jokes,

128
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:38,896
and they can watch them whenever they like,

129
00:08:38,896 --> 00:08:40,256
I'm not living for anyone else,

130
00:08:40,696 --> 00:08:42,616
why can't you listen to anything?

131
00:08:42,616 --> 00:08:43,696
You've been fighting each other all day,

132
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:45,576
and you still don't want me to live with your dad.

133
00:08:45,936 --> 00:08:47,175
No, I didn't go against it.

134
00:08:47,696 --> 00:08:48,496
Auntie,

135
00:08:48,496 --> 00:08:48,816
if you do this,

136
00:08:48,816 --> 00:08:50,056
Go back and take care of uncle.

137
00:08:50,056 --> 00:08:50,696
I'll talk to him.

138
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:52,576
Look at Xu,

139
00:08:53,496 --> 00:08:54,056
let's go.

140
00:08:54,056 --> 00:08:54,576
Don't worry. Auntie

141
00:08:55,696 --> 00:08:56,136
is gone.

142
00:08:57,696 --> 00:08:58,496
What do you think?

143
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,256
Your dad finally got you a pack,

144
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:01,576
and from now on, Mr. Xiao, Mr. Xiao,

145
00:09:01,576 --> 00:09:03,016
Dozens of billions of projects

146
00:09:03,816 --> 00:09:04,496
have been sent to you.

147
00:09:04,496 --> 00:09:05,056
You wanted to give it to you,

148
00:09:05,056 --> 00:09:06,256
but your dad didn't give it to you,

149
00:09:06,256 --> 00:09:07,295
Take me

150
00:09:22,816 --> 00:09:23,816
with you.

151
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:25,415
It collapsed like this.

152
00:09:25,415 --> 00:09:26,016
Gosh.

153
00:09:28,816 --> 00:09:30,376
It's too serious. It's also

154
00:09:41,136 --> 00:09:42,136
in my dad's eyes,

155
00:09:42,496 --> 00:09:43,816
I'm just like this house.

156
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:46,215
It collapsed before it was built.

157
00:09:47,616 --> 00:09:48,696
Don't go in. It's dangerous.

158
00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:53,735
Parents

159
00:09:53,735 --> 00:09:54,376
are like this.

160
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:56,936
So are my parents,

161
00:09:56,936 --> 00:09:58,295
who call me all day,

162
00:09:58,295 --> 00:09:59,256
He asked me to go back to work.

163
00:10:00,456 --> 00:10:01,456
You're different from me.

164
00:10:02,256 --> 00:10:03,496
You're inheriting the family business.

165
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:05,016
Come on.

166
00:10:05,376 --> 00:10:07,576
If I sell underwear, socks and warm underwear for the rest of my life,

167
00:10:07,576 --> 00:10:09,496
I might as well hang out with you here.

168
00:10:15,696 --> 00:10:16,256
Chief Commandant.

169
00:10:18,376 --> 00:10:19,056
Thank you.

170
00:10:23,616 --> 00:10:24,735
It's useless.

171
00:10:25,936 --> 00:10:26,456
Are you thirsty?

172
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:27,376
I'll get you a bottle of water.

173
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:31,256
Don't go inside.

174
00:10:42,295 --> 00:10:43,136
Hello, Linlin.

175
00:10:43,136 --> 00:10:43,696
Hey,

176
00:10:43,696 --> 00:10:44,576
Go to the Chief Commandant.

177
00:10:45,136 --> 00:10:45,576
I'm sorry.

178
00:10:45,576 --> 00:10:46,616
Something came up at home,

179
00:10:46,616 --> 00:10:47,616
I'll commandeer your boyfriend,

180
00:10:47,896 --> 00:10:48,936
and I'll find him for you.

181
00:10:48,936 --> 00:10:49,696
Xiao Feng,

182
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:50,616
I want to see you.

183
00:10:50,896 --> 00:10:51,936
When is it convenient for you?

184
00:10:52,256 --> 00:10:53,175
I want to meet you.

185
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:55,456
Looking for me

186
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:56,655
Let's talk when we meet.

187
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:57,936
Don't tell the Chief Commandant yet.

188
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,376
How long have you known Xu Wei?

189
00:11:18,856 --> 00:11:19,736
Three years.

190
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,415
I've been with him for almost five years,

191
00:11:21,896 --> 00:11:23,295
and we were going to get married last year,

192
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:25,016
His parents have chosen a house,

193
00:11:25,496 --> 00:11:27,096
but he said he's not ready to get married yet.

194
00:11:27,096 --> 00:11:28,055
We'll have to wait a little longer.

195
00:11:29,736 --> 00:11:31,055
I know those are excuses.

196
00:11:31,935 --> 00:11:32,815
He's waiting for you.

197
00:11:35,256 --> 00:11:36,575
He never told me.

198
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,616
How could he tell you?

199
00:11:38,655 --> 00:11:40,496
If he leaves, who else will help you?

200
00:11:40,496 --> 00:11:42,136
No one else can help you pursue your dream.

201
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:45,896
That's also his dream.

202
00:11:45,896 --> 00:11:46,496
Xiao Feng,

203
00:11:48,256 --> 00:11:48,935
I came to see you today.

204
00:11:48,935 --> 00:11:50,136
I don't want to argue with you,

205
00:11:51,376 --> 00:11:52,496
I just want to tell you,

206
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:55,415
I love him.

207
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,455
I want to be with him for the rest of my life,

208
00:11:58,256 --> 00:11:59,496
instead of playing computer games

209
00:11:59,496 --> 00:12:00,695
with him for a few years.

210
00:12:02,415 --> 00:12:03,896
I know what happened between you and Peach,

211
00:12:04,455 --> 00:12:05,896
I don't want Xu Wei to go that far.

212
00:12:13,376 --> 00:12:13,856
Xiao Feng,

213
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,695
I'm begging you.

214
00:12:19,216 --> 00:12:20,336
Let him go, okay?

215
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:53,376
Stand up.

216
00:12:54,496 --> 00:12:57,496
Hello, Miss Bai.

217
00:12:57,496 --> 00:12:58,496
Please have a seat.

218
00:13:00,376 --> 00:13:01,575
For today's English test,

219
00:13:01,976 --> 00:13:03,535
there are two papers in total.

220
00:13:03,535 --> 00:13:04,896
The exam time is 40 minutes. I'll be the invigilator

221
00:13:04,896 --> 00:13:07,136
and the monitor will hand out the test paper.

222
00:13:34,016 --> 00:13:34,616
Let me have a look.

223
00:14:54,096 --> 00:14:54,616
Hey,

224
00:14:55,976 --> 00:14:57,136
do you play Cross Fire?

225
00:14:59,016 --> 00:15:00,136
I have a lot of guns in my car for you.

226
00:15:01,736 --> 00:15:03,575
Do you know my horoscope?

227
00:15:05,415 --> 00:15:06,616
It's tailor-made for you.

228
00:15:08,216 --> 00:15:09,175
What's your blood type?

229
00:15:11,016 --> 00:15:12,136
You're my ideal type,

230
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,295
and our team won

231
00:15:14,295 --> 00:15:15,336
the Cross Fire Championship,

232
00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:17,376
Let's play together tonight and I'll take you to lie down and win.

233
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:18,616
Really?

234
00:15:18,896 --> 00:15:19,655
Really?

235
00:15:20,496 --> 00:15:21,496
I'll prove to him that

236
00:15:22,376 --> 00:15:23,616
there are four teams playing,

237
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:25,096
The other three teams

238
00:15:25,655 --> 00:15:26,535
are all primary school students.

239
00:15:27,896 --> 00:15:28,856
Let's go.

240
00:15:28,856 --> 00:15:29,496
He must be a pervert.

241
00:15:30,136 --> 00:15:31,136
Don't go.

242
00:15:31,136 --> 00:15:32,136
You haven't added

243
00:15:32,736 --> 00:15:33,856
WeChat yet. It's embarrassing.

244
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:35,736
Lu Xiaobei,

245
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:37,535
are your Five Elements wicked?

246
00:15:37,535 --> 00:15:38,575
How can you cheat people like that?

247
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:39,376
Cheng Hao,

248
00:15:39,896 --> 00:15:41,575
anyone with eyes can tell.

249
00:15:42,016 --> 00:15:42,896
What I lack is my leg,

250
00:15:42,896 --> 00:15:43,856
but what you lack is a girl

251
00:15:45,616 --> 00:15:47,496
from the Germany sports team. How dare you flirt with her?

252
00:15:47,736 --> 00:15:49,136
I might break my leg.

253
00:15:50,415 --> 00:15:51,775
Why did you call me here all of a sudden?

254
00:15:52,415 --> 00:15:54,455
To celebrate your elimination from Gravity Trial.

255
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:55,336
I'm coming.

256
00:15:55,575 --> 00:15:56,336
Guard back. Guard back.

257
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:57,896
Run the position.

258
00:15:58,016 --> 00:15:59,096
Follow the position next to you.

259
00:15:59,175 --> 00:16:00,376
Nan, pass the ball.

260
00:16:00,575 --> 00:16:01,336
Pass it to me,

261
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:02,455
The area is empty

262
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:03,856
in three seconds. Send it back quickly.

263
00:16:03,856 --> 00:16:04,455
I got it. I got it.

264
00:16:04,976 --> 00:16:05,695
Nice shot.

265
00:16:24,496 --> 00:16:25,535
I want to form a team,

266
00:16:27,256 --> 00:16:28,616
don't you always want to go to a professional team

267
00:16:28,616 --> 00:16:29,976
instead of a team?

268
00:16:30,736 --> 00:16:31,736
That was before.

269
00:16:32,896 --> 00:16:34,736
I have to change the way I play now.

270
00:16:35,096 --> 00:16:36,016
Okay.

271
00:16:36,016 --> 00:16:37,055
The team is ready-made.

272
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,216
You are always welcome

273
00:16:39,736 --> 00:16:40,376
to join your team.

274
00:16:42,016 --> 00:16:42,655
I'm not interested.

275
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:44,896
Brother,

276
00:16:44,896 --> 00:16:46,535
can you stop looking at people under the door?

277
00:16:46,616 --> 00:16:48,616
Our team has won the championship at least.

278
00:16:48,616 --> 00:16:50,256
Don't show off the competition

279
00:16:50,256 --> 00:16:51,496
that cheats the registration fee.

280
00:16:53,336 --> 00:16:54,016
What I want

281
00:16:54,976 --> 00:16:56,096
is to be able to carry it on the field,

282
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:57,815
The team playing the game.

283
00:16:59,256 --> 00:17:00,616
We're going to need a couple of hard guns,

284
00:17:00,736 --> 00:17:01,295
Okay,

285
00:17:01,535 --> 00:17:02,216
As long as you open your mouth,

286
00:17:02,616 --> 00:17:03,736
there will be no one in Ningjiang,

287
00:17:03,736 --> 00:17:04,935
I, Cheng Hao, can't find it.

288
00:17:05,736 --> 00:17:06,496
Except for the dead.

289
00:17:18,256 --> 00:17:18,736
What are you doing?

290
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:21,616
Last time

291
00:17:21,616 --> 00:17:23,096
Do you know about the beating of people

292
00:17:23,496 --> 00:17:24,295
in Ningjiang singles challenge?

293
00:17:24,775 --> 00:17:25,455
I have the impression

294
00:17:25,856 --> 00:17:27,136
that the captain of Team King,

295
00:17:27,496 --> 00:17:28,016
Wang Kai. Yes,

296
00:17:28,616 --> 00:17:29,256
it's him.

297
00:17:29,856 --> 00:17:30,496
How is he?

298
00:17:32,535 --> 00:17:33,736
Brother, don't mess with him.

299
00:17:33,775 --> 00:17:35,055
He doesn't know how to do it,

300
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,856
but his marksmanship and temper are wild.

301
00:17:37,216 --> 00:17:38,496
I watched the video of his game,

302
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:39,896
and his MA4

303
00:17:40,136 --> 00:17:40,736
is very accurate.

304
00:17:41,096 --> 00:17:41,856
Yes,

305
00:17:41,856 --> 00:17:42,976
but he's throwing a lot of trouble everywhere,

306
00:17:42,976 --> 00:17:44,336
He even picked those strong teams.

307
00:17:44,736 --> 00:17:45,976
If you lose, you have to give him the trophy.

308
00:17:46,376 --> 00:17:47,376
Over the past six months,

309
00:17:47,376 --> 00:17:48,256
many teams in Ningjiang Division

310
00:17:48,616 --> 00:17:50,376
have been in his hands.

311
00:17:51,736 --> 00:17:53,896
I also heard that there are so many medals and trophies in their family,

312
00:17:53,896 --> 00:17:54,896
they can't let go of them.

313
00:17:55,736 --> 00:17:56,535
Interesting.

314
00:17:58,136 --> 00:17:59,256
How can I find him?

315
00:18:00,016 --> 00:18:00,896
I remember they had a match

316
00:18:00,896 --> 00:18:02,256
with the Winged Team today,

317
00:18:02,376 --> 00:18:02,976
The Winged Team,

318
00:18:02,976 --> 00:18:04,575
was also the runner-up of last year's Invitational Tournament.

319
00:18:04,976 --> 00:18:06,216
I think a lot of people went to see

320
00:18:06,856 --> 00:18:07,616
you. Where are you going?

321
00:18:08,376 --> 00:18:09,376
Let's go join in the fun.

322
00:18:10,016 --> 00:18:10,535
I'll go too.

323
00:18:17,376 --> 00:18:17,896
Look,

324
00:18:18,136 --> 00:18:18,976
it's over there.

325
00:18:18,976 --> 00:18:19,655
Let's go.

326
00:18:25,376 --> 00:18:26,256
Do you know how to play?

327
00:18:26,256 --> 00:18:27,935
They shoot more slowly than the old lady crossing the road.

328
00:18:27,976 --> 00:18:28,616
How can I hang out?

329
00:18:29,535 --> 00:18:30,496
Gate B is waiting for you to blow your head off.

330
00:18:30,496 --> 00:18:31,136
Hurry up.

331
00:18:46,096 --> 00:18:46,896
Nice gun.

332
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,136
What do you think?

333
00:18:48,136 --> 00:18:49,016
Sorry,

334
00:18:50,175 --> 00:18:50,976
it's mine.

335
00:18:51,616 --> 00:18:52,136
Take it back.

336
00:18:53,736 --> 00:18:54,616
By the way,

337
00:18:54,896 --> 00:18:56,256
Is there anyone else who wants to challenge?

338
00:18:56,256 --> 00:18:57,136
If you have something to say,

339
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,496
just tell me,

340
00:18:59,136 --> 00:18:59,896
so that I won't have to go to war. Is it too expensive?

341
00:19:00,376 --> 00:19:01,096
Did you?

342
00:19:03,695 --> 00:19:04,256
What?

343
00:19:04,415 --> 00:19:05,376
Ningjiang is so big,

344
00:19:05,376 --> 00:19:06,976
there is no one that can be beaten.

345
00:19:14,616 --> 00:19:15,896
Misunderstanding. I tripped

346
00:19:15,896 --> 00:19:16,736
just now. I'm sorry.

347
00:19:18,736 --> 00:19:19,376
Who is it?

348
00:19:19,896 --> 00:19:21,736
It seems to belong to the Eagle team.

349
00:19:21,896 --> 00:19:22,695
Cheng Hao,

350
00:19:25,016 --> 00:19:26,856
Brother Hao,

351
00:19:27,096 --> 00:19:29,016
I heard that you won a championship

352
00:19:32,376 --> 00:19:33,496
recently. A small competition.

353
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:34,056
It's not worth mentioning.

354
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:34,896
Nothing.

355
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:35,896
Goodbye.

356
00:19:36,695 --> 00:19:37,455
Did he ask you to leave?

357
00:19:38,776 --> 00:19:39,695
It's all yours.

358
00:19:40,296 --> 00:19:41,096
At 7 o'clock tomorrow night,

359
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:41,655
you choose the place,

360
00:19:42,296 --> 00:19:44,536
Our team hasn't trained much recently,

361
00:19:44,576 --> 00:19:45,495
and it's not in good condition.

362
00:19:45,495 --> 00:19:46,776
So I'll make an appointment next time.

363
00:19:46,975 --> 00:19:47,415
Bye.

364
00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:49,215
You're a coward, aren't you?

365
00:19:50,935 --> 00:19:52,056
If you don't accept the challenge,

366
00:19:53,336 --> 00:19:54,296
you can change the name of the team.

367
00:19:54,896 --> 00:19:55,455
Change the name

368
00:19:56,215 --> 00:20:09,015
Vegetable chicken,

369
00:20:09,015 --> 00:20:09,856
vegetable chicken,

370
00:20:10,415 --> 00:20:11,015
Cheng Hao Yes,

371
00:20:11,616 --> 00:20:12,096
Okay,

372
00:20:12,896 --> 00:20:13,655
Seven o'clock tomorrow night,

373
00:20:13,856 --> 00:20:14,655
right here.

374
00:20:16,376 --> 00:20:16,655
Be good,

375
00:20:18,415 --> 00:20:19,495
Remember to bring the trophy with you.

376
00:20:19,495 --> 00:20:22,336
Why do you owe me so much? You

377
00:20:22,376 --> 00:20:24,655
and I are kind enough to take you to watch the fun.

378
00:20:24,655 --> 00:20:26,255
You pushed me into the fire, didn't you?

379
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,455
And then you ran away.

380
00:20:28,455 --> 00:20:29,376
Is there anyone like you?

381
00:20:29,816 --> 00:20:31,136
There are so many people in the internet cafe,

382
00:20:31,136 --> 00:20:32,336
but none of them dare to say anything,

383
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,776
It's a great courage for you to stand up.

384
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:35,776
We've already won half of it.

385
00:20:36,175 --> 00:20:36,776
What are you afraid of?

386
00:20:37,616 --> 00:20:38,655
I'm not afraid of him.

387
00:20:38,816 --> 00:20:40,096
I'm keeping a low profile, you know?

388
00:20:40,096 --> 00:20:40,616
Keep a low profile.

389
00:20:41,056 --> 00:20:42,376
No matter how low it is, you won't be able to adjust it.

390
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,975
There must be a girl at the scene tomorrow,

391
00:20:45,576 --> 00:20:46,735
if you are really afraid of shame.

392
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,455
Just change your name to Vegetable Chicken.

393
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:49,735
Let me tell you,

394
00:20:50,336 --> 00:20:51,455
tomorrow I'll show you

395
00:20:51,455 --> 00:20:52,455
how powerful my team is,

396
00:20:53,056 --> 00:20:53,536
Let's go home.

397
00:20:53,975 --> 00:20:54,896
You're going to take the college entrance examination this year?

398
00:20:55,215 --> 00:20:55,776
Study hard.

399
00:20:56,096 --> 00:20:56,735
The college entrance examination,

400
00:20:57,935 --> 00:20:59,415
the college entrance examination is still one year away,

401
00:21:00,056 --> 00:21:01,616
But it's less than a month away

402
00:21:02,376 --> 00:21:03,616
from the start of the 100-city league.

403
00:21:03,975 --> 00:21:04,495
Wait.

404
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:06,015
100-city league?

405
00:21:07,336 --> 00:21:07,975
Yes.

406
00:21:09,096 --> 00:21:10,816
That's the only way to get into the professional league.

407
00:21:14,455 --> 00:21:16,455
From the 100-city league to the professional league,

408
00:21:16,455 --> 00:21:17,695
do you know what the concept is?

409
00:21:17,695 --> 00:21:17,735
Do you know what the concept is? Of course I do.

410
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:18,495
Of course I know.

411
00:21:19,455 --> 00:21:21,695
That meant playing nearly a hundred series

412
00:21:22,136 --> 00:21:23,776
and winning in well over

413
00:21:23,776 --> 00:21:24,975
90 percent of the games.

414
00:21:24,975 --> 00:21:26,536
Only in this way can we get out of 100 cities.

415
00:21:26,975 --> 00:21:28,376
to play in a semi-professional round-robin

416
00:21:29,215 --> 00:21:29,896
and then with two teams

417
00:21:29,896 --> 00:21:31,415
that came down from the professional league,

418
00:21:31,975 --> 00:21:33,536
to compete for the qualification to participate in the professional league.

419
00:21:34,096 --> 00:21:35,096
Wake up.

420
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:36,655
It's only theoretically possible.

421
00:21:37,336 --> 00:21:38,136
I'm serious.

422
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,695
I must enter the Cross Fire Professional League.

423
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:52,816
No matter what method you use.

424
00:22:04,215 --> 00:22:04,735
Fuck him.

425
00:22:06,136 --> 00:22:06,655
Inside the box,

426
00:22:07,655 --> 00:22:08,255
Brother Peng,

427
00:22:10,536 --> 00:22:10,935
smoke.

428
00:22:14,735 --> 00:22:15,935
Guys, stop.

429
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:16,735
Come here.

430
00:22:19,935 --> 00:22:20,856
Do you know him?

431
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:21,576
Who is it? This is

432
00:22:22,376 --> 00:22:24,096
Seven who doesn't know Steel Team.

433
00:22:24,695 --> 00:22:26,975
Back then, it was our first sniper in Ningjiang,

434
00:22:27,616 --> 00:22:29,735
Brother Peng Gang's team,

435
00:22:29,735 --> 00:22:30,616
I've never heard of

436
00:22:31,136 --> 00:22:32,215
the Steel Battle Team.

437
00:22:32,816 --> 00:22:33,776
We're all old people.

438
00:22:33,776 --> 00:22:35,096
Don't make things hard for these kids.

439
00:22:35,376 --> 00:22:36,495
Why do you want to contact me?

440
00:22:36,816 --> 00:22:38,296
I've been looking for a chance to cooperate with you, haven't I?

441
00:22:39,296 --> 00:22:40,415
We happen to practice guns,

442
00:22:40,415 --> 00:22:40,975
play games together,

443
00:22:41,495 --> 00:22:42,136
Okay,

444
00:22:42,296 --> 00:22:42,856
Come on.

445
00:23:02,175 --> 00:23:03,616
Senior, only your gun

446
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:04,455
is amazing.

447
00:23:08,056 --> 00:23:09,576
I can't. Your senior?

448
00:23:10,616 --> 00:23:12,255
Why are you dead again?

449
00:23:29,896 --> 00:23:31,215
At this age,

450
00:23:31,215 --> 00:23:32,336
don't come out and make a fool of yourself.

451
00:23:33,856 --> 00:23:34,536
Fine,

452
00:23:34,536 --> 00:23:36,175
fine. Forget it. Stop fighting.

453
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,215
Brother,

454
00:23:38,576 --> 00:23:40,376
it's useless to be old.

455
00:23:41,896 --> 00:23:42,816
Right now,

456
00:23:42,816 --> 00:23:43,616
aren't we going to play

457
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,255
the National Challenge Division Competition?

458
00:23:45,255 --> 00:23:46,735
We happen to be short of a person

459
00:23:47,455 --> 00:23:48,776
who can serve tea and order food,

460
00:23:49,015 --> 00:23:49,695
Are you coming?

461
00:23:51,776 --> 00:23:53,136
We also signed up for that competition.

462
00:23:53,896 --> 00:23:54,816
I'm not here to see you.

463
00:23:54,816 --> 00:23:56,455
Are you thinking of joining forces to form a team?

464
00:23:56,455 --> 00:23:57,255
I have a buddy

465
00:23:57,255 --> 00:23:58,175
who uses MA4 very accurately,

466
00:23:58,175 --> 00:23:58,856
Okay, okay.

467
00:23:58,856 --> 00:23:59,816
Hold on, hold on.

468
00:23:59,816 --> 00:24:01,215
What kind of strong alliance?

469
00:24:01,896 --> 00:24:03,376
The team can't make it anymore.

470
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:04,896
How dare you blow here.

471
00:24:05,415 --> 00:24:06,816
Why do you have such a big heart?

472
00:24:07,015 --> 00:24:07,816
Is it really

473
00:24:07,816 --> 00:24:08,415
funny?

474
00:24:09,776 --> 00:24:10,856
As a man,

475
00:24:10,856 --> 00:24:12,056
one spit and one nail,

476
00:24:12,056 --> 00:24:13,415
That's all for today.

477
00:24:13,695 --> 00:24:15,175
We're aiming for the national champion.

478
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:16,536
The national champion.

479
00:24:18,215 --> 00:24:19,296
He wants to win the national championship.

480
00:24:20,655 --> 00:24:21,776
Awesome.

481
00:24:22,255 --> 00:24:23,175
I'm telling you,

482
00:24:23,856 --> 00:24:24,896
the national champion,

483
00:24:25,415 --> 00:24:26,616
Dream on when you go home. Take it.

484
00:24:26,616 --> 00:24:27,296
I can't hold it here.

485
00:24:27,695 --> 00:24:28,655
And you're going to be

486
00:24:29,096 --> 00:24:30,495
late. Someone else is having this dream.

487
00:24:30,495 --> 00:24:31,415
You can't even make it.

488
00:24:32,336 --> 00:24:33,616
Let's start. Let's start.

489
00:24:34,215 --> 00:24:34,935
Dream on.

490
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:36,735
Go back now.

491
00:24:40,096 --> 00:24:40,695
See you at the competition.

492
00:24:41,175 --> 00:24:42,175
Let's go.

493
00:24:42,175 --> 00:24:43,136
Let's go.

494
00:24:43,655 --> 00:24:44,856
Good job,

495
00:24:45,136 --> 00:24:45,816
guys. Keep it up.

496
00:24:45,816 --> 00:24:47,096
Come on.

497
00:24:47,735 --> 00:24:48,616
Fight hard.

498
00:24:48,616 --> 00:24:49,536
When we win the championship,

499
00:24:49,536 --> 00:24:50,536
we'll give out the bonus

500
00:24:52,576 --> 00:24:54,576
Great Thank you, boss Thank you

501
00:25:03,096 --> 00:25:04,056
Lu Xiao Bei Chu Ge

502
00:25:16,136 --> 00:25:17,816
Why should I be 14 and you 15?

503
00:25:19,056 --> 00:25:20,136
Even if you can copy it wrong,

504
00:25:20,455 --> 00:25:21,495
I'm so impressed.

505
00:25:24,495 --> 00:25:26,175
How capable do I think you are?

506
00:25:26,856 --> 00:25:28,015
With your score,

507
00:25:28,015 --> 00:25:28,695
during the exam,

508
00:25:30,576 --> 00:25:31,735
What are you

509
00:25:31,735 --> 00:25:33,015
covering up for?

510
00:25:33,576 --> 00:25:34,455
Yes,

511
00:25:35,056 --> 00:25:36,056
I'm second to last.

512
00:25:36,376 --> 00:25:37,455
You're the last one.

513
00:25:37,856 --> 00:25:39,096
There are differences between us.

514
00:25:39,096 --> 00:25:40,816
Why are you so happy about being second to last in the exam?

515
00:25:40,816 --> 00:25:42,616
Don't belittle others.

516
00:25:42,616 --> 00:25:44,096
Don't beautify yourself.

517
00:25:48,336 --> 00:25:49,735
Can I ask you a question?

518
00:25:53,455 --> 00:25:54,376
Why

519
00:25:54,376 --> 00:25:55,175
are you lame?

520
00:25:59,336 --> 00:26:01,536
Did you say something you shouldn't say?

521
00:26:02,015 --> 00:26:02,816
I asked someone to call me.

522
00:26:03,975 --> 00:26:04,935
It's not that legendary.

523
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:06,175
It was just a car accident.

524
00:26:07,255 --> 00:26:08,495
But after I got into the wheelchair,

525
00:26:08,975 --> 00:26:09,935
I found out a secret,

526
00:26:10,935 --> 00:26:12,495
My legs don't work anymore.

527
00:26:13,015 --> 00:26:14,816
Instead, my head has become much better.

528
00:26:15,655 --> 00:26:16,215
I recommend you to try it.

529
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:19,175
You're annoying.

530
00:26:20,935 --> 00:26:23,136
You can always find a way to make others hate you.

531
00:26:24,056 --> 00:26:26,975
Friendship often starts with hating each other,

532
00:26:27,495 --> 00:26:28,495
maybe,

533
00:26:28,695 --> 00:26:30,136
We can be friends.

534
00:26:32,776 --> 00:26:33,816
Next life.

535
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,175
Next life.

536
00:26:37,856 --> 00:26:39,536
Next life.

537
00:26:39,536 --> 00:26:40,695
Next life, next life.

538
00:26:40,896 --> 00:26:42,695
Next, next, next life.

539
00:26:42,695 --> 00:26:43,896
Next, next, next life.

540
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:47,415
Go, go, go.

541
00:26:54,455 --> 00:26:55,376
Keep up. Keep up. Don't

542
00:26:55,376 --> 00:26:56,215
worry. Be careful.

543
00:26:57,655 --> 00:26:58,975
Smash the sniper on the other side.

544
00:26:58,975 --> 00:27:00,136
There are people, there are people,

545
00:27:00,136 --> 00:27:00,975
hold on.

546
00:27:00,975 --> 00:27:01,975
I saw it. I saw it.

547
00:27:02,255 --> 00:27:02,536
There are two more

548
00:27:02,536 --> 00:27:03,255
in the middle. Hold on.

549
00:27:03,336 --> 00:27:03,975
Pay attention to the fact that

550
00:27:03,975 --> 00:27:04,975
all people in mid are taking A's,

551
00:27:06,175 --> 00:27:07,415
Throw a cigarette first.

552
00:27:07,415 --> 00:27:07,935
Don't worry,

553
00:27:09,096 --> 00:27:10,296
Slow down. Slow down. Steady.

554
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:11,215
Drop one

555
00:27:11,536 --> 00:27:12,695
in the middle. That's great.

556
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:14,215
I lost the middle road.

557
00:27:19,296 --> 00:27:19,776
Brother Hao,

558
00:27:20,336 --> 00:27:20,975
let's discuss something.

559
00:27:21,776 --> 00:27:22,816
Stop fighting!

560
00:27:23,735 --> 00:27:24,735
I'll take the trophy.

561
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:30,495
I'm here.

562
00:27:31,096 --> 00:27:31,776
Where are you going?

563
00:27:32,255 --> 00:27:32,896
Let's go home.

564
00:27:33,495 --> 00:27:34,495
This time, it's embarrassing and embarrassing.

565
00:27:35,376 --> 00:27:36,255
I won't fight anymore.

566
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:36,616
If we lose,

567
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:39,136
don't we still have two rounds left?

568
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,816
Why did you lose?

569
00:27:41,175 --> 00:27:41,856
What do you mean?

570
00:27:43,975 --> 00:27:44,935
I'll call it back for you.

571
00:27:50,495 --> 00:27:51,616
I don't bully disabled people.

572
00:27:51,616 --> 00:27:52,296
How can you say that?

573
00:27:52,816 --> 00:27:54,015
It's not certain who will bully who

574
00:27:58,455 --> 00:27:58,695
Come on,

575
00:27:58,695 --> 00:27:59,215
Cheng Hao,

576
00:27:59,655 --> 00:28:00,655
everyone,

577
00:28:00,655 --> 00:28:01,655
Follow my lead,

578
00:28:02,096 --> 00:28:02,735
guys,

579
00:28:02,735 --> 00:28:03,655
Listen to Bei. Three,

580
00:28:04,655 --> 00:28:05,175
two, A.

581
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:06,896
Let's play three, two, A.

582
00:28:06,896 --> 00:28:07,935
Cheng Hao and I will go to A University,

583
00:28:07,935 --> 00:28:08,776
while the others will go to A Trail,

584
00:28:09,056 --> 00:28:09,695
No problem.

585
00:28:11,336 --> 00:28:12,015
Pay attention to

586
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:24,376
the big drop of A in mid.

587
00:28:24,376 --> 00:28:25,056
Nice.

588
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:49,896
Just be careful at point B.

589
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:50,695
Don't let anyone die.

590
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:51,536
Hold on, hold on.

591
00:28:51,536 --> 00:28:52,495
Their marksmanship has gone haywire.

592
00:28:57,695 --> 00:28:58,975
What are you fighting for?

593
00:28:59,376 --> 00:29:01,296
You run slower than Old Madam crossing the street.

594
00:29:01,816 --> 00:29:03,175
Did you hear what I said?

595
00:29:07,655 --> 00:29:09,336
Do you have anyone in charge of keeping an eye on me?

596
00:29:09,455 --> 00:29:10,616
Do you want me to send you a location?

597
00:29:11,935 --> 00:29:12,616
Bro,

598
00:29:12,655 --> 00:29:13,376
Gate B,

599
00:29:13,415 --> 00:29:14,175
I'm talking to you.

600
00:29:14,376 --> 00:29:15,215
Gate B,

601
00:29:15,215 --> 00:29:17,056
I'll wait for you at Gate B to blow your head off.

602
00:29:17,096 --> 00:29:17,935
If I kill you,

603
00:29:19,415 --> 00:29:20,336
all of you go to Gate A.

604
00:29:20,816 --> 00:29:21,576
Leave Gate B to me.

605
00:29:29,616 --> 00:29:30,655
The last one is on my face,

606
00:29:32,776 --> 00:29:33,175
Drop it.

607
00:29:33,175 --> 00:29:33,896
Nice.

608
00:29:42,415 --> 00:29:44,136
Cheng Hao said he would give you the trophy if he lost,

609
00:29:44,655 --> 00:29:45,495
but now you've lost.

610
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:47,215
What are you going to lose to us?

611
00:29:49,296 --> 00:29:50,056
What do you want?

612
00:29:52,175 --> 00:29:53,136
Your marksmanship is not bad.

613
00:29:54,056 --> 00:29:54,776
You can hang out with me from now on.

614
00:29:56,776 --> 00:29:58,136
At least give it some serious consideration.

615
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,576
Just your teammates?

616
00:30:00,576 --> 00:30:02,175
It's fine to brush the presence in Ningjiang.

617
00:30:02,616 --> 00:30:03,975
But if you really want to play professionally with your grades,

618
00:30:04,975 --> 00:30:05,816
you know it,

619
00:30:06,856 --> 00:30:07,616
Not even close.

620
00:30:13,296 --> 00:30:14,415
I'll wait for you.

621
00:30:14,415 --> 00:30:15,096
Wang Kai,

622
00:30:15,096 --> 00:30:15,975
wait for me if you dare.

623
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:21,616
Xiaobei,

624
00:30:21,616 --> 00:30:22,376
who are you messing with?

625
00:30:22,376 --> 00:30:23,415
If I have to mess with him,

626
00:30:24,215 --> 00:30:25,376
not only will I mess with him,

627
00:30:25,975 --> 00:30:27,215
I'm going to take him away.

628
00:30:28,056 --> 00:30:29,136
You're out of your mind.

629
00:30:29,655 --> 00:30:30,975
If this kind of person is recruited into our team,

630
00:30:30,975 --> 00:30:32,136
why don't they fight every day?

631
00:30:32,495 --> 00:30:33,376
I'm afraid he won't come

632
00:30:33,935 --> 00:30:34,735
if I don't want to fight.

633
00:30:35,856 --> 00:30:37,136
You were so arrogant just now.

634
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:38,255
It's strange if he's willing to come.

635
00:30:40,735 --> 00:30:41,816
Was I arrogant just now?

636
00:30:42,735 --> 00:30:43,655
Not very arrogant,

637
00:30:43,896 --> 00:30:45,015
but very arrogant.

638
00:31:47,415 --> 00:31:49,096
From now on, be good. Don't fool around.

639
00:31:49,096 --> 00:31:49,975
Look at you now.

640
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:51,056
Find a serious job.

641
00:31:51,056 --> 00:31:51,776
Is it OK?

642
00:31:52,096 --> 00:31:53,015
I'm not fooling around.

643
00:31:53,015 --> 00:31:54,215
I'm sticking to my dream.

644
00:31:54,215 --> 00:31:55,616
Time will tell.

645
00:31:55,616 --> 00:31:57,336
Yes, time can prove it,

646
00:31:57,336 --> 00:31:58,415
that is, when I broke up with you,

647
00:31:58,415 --> 00:31:59,415
How correct it is.

648
00:31:59,415 --> 00:32:00,735
He's already in his twenties,

649
00:32:00,776 --> 00:32:01,896
You don't even have a proper job.

650
00:32:02,695 --> 00:32:03,695
I'm begging you.

651
00:32:03,975 --> 00:32:05,015
Let him go, okay?

652
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:24,816
So many dishes

653
00:32:25,495 --> 00:32:26,536
have won the lottery,

654
00:32:29,175 --> 00:32:29,616
We two

655
00:32:30,096 --> 00:32:31,175
I've eaten so much instant noodles.

656
00:32:31,455 --> 00:32:32,415
It's time for a change of taste.

657
00:32:34,376 --> 00:32:35,296
What good news?

658
00:32:35,655 --> 00:32:36,896
You've been bored all day.

659
00:32:44,616 --> 00:32:46,175
What are you doing?

660
00:32:49,776 --> 00:32:51,136
I have good things to do, too.

661
00:32:51,896 --> 00:32:53,616
I want to celebrate with you.

662
00:33:02,896 --> 00:33:03,616
What good news?

663
00:33:04,975 --> 00:33:05,695
Tell me about it.

664
00:33:06,655 --> 00:33:07,215
You go first.

665
00:33:08,816 --> 00:33:10,056
Hurry up.

666
00:33:10,056 --> 00:33:11,776
You don't have to hide anything from me.

667
00:33:17,616 --> 00:33:18,695
I canceled my registration.

668
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:20,975
What registration?

669
00:33:41,175 --> 00:33:42,896
I canceled my registration for the National Challenge.

670
00:33:50,415 --> 00:33:51,175
Why?

671
00:33:56,896 --> 00:33:57,376
Chief Commandant.

672
00:33:59,415 --> 00:34:00,455
We're not young anymore,

673
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,536
so just do what we need to do.

674
00:34:04,616 --> 00:34:06,536
Don't join in the fun with those kids.

675
00:34:08,376 --> 00:34:09,175
Xiao Feng

676
00:34:09,975 --> 00:34:10,975
Are you kidding me?

677
00:34:14,975 --> 00:34:15,655
I'm not kidding.

678
00:34:19,336 --> 00:34:19,896
Today,

679
00:34:22,376 --> 00:34:23,415
it's our farewell dinner.

680
00:34:26,576 --> 00:34:27,376
Tell me,

681
00:34:27,896 --> 00:34:28,655
why?

682
00:34:35,096 --> 00:34:36,096
Didn't I tell you?

683
00:34:37,336 --> 00:34:38,495
We're not kids anymore.

684
00:34:40,616 --> 00:34:41,856
We don't have the energy

685
00:34:42,336 --> 00:34:43,215
and reaction anymore.

686
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:44,655
Don't talk to me about anything else.

687
00:34:46,136 --> 00:34:47,816
Tell me what happened to you?

688
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:52,975
I said,

689
00:34:54,536 --> 00:34:56,616
I'll withdraw my registration

690
00:34:56,616 --> 00:34:57,616
for the National Challenge.

691
00:34:59,776 --> 00:35:00,776
Didn't you say

692
00:35:02,096 --> 00:35:03,536
you'd win the championship together?

693
00:35:05,056 --> 00:35:07,136
Didn't you say you wanted to teach them a lesson?

694
00:35:08,616 --> 00:35:09,975
I've boasted too much.

695
00:35:10,655 --> 00:35:11,655
I'll cash them all.

696
00:35:11,896 --> 00:35:12,695
No, I'm exhausted.

697
00:35:25,975 --> 00:35:27,255
Did Linlin come to see you?

698
00:35:33,415 --> 00:35:34,536
I knew it was her.

699
00:35:35,056 --> 00:35:36,576
You don't have to mind our business.

700
00:35:37,576 --> 00:35:38,616
It has nothing to do with her.

701
00:35:43,215 --> 00:35:44,376
This is my decision.

702
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:45,776
You know what?

703
00:35:46,336 --> 00:35:47,136
An hour ago,

704
00:35:47,136 --> 00:35:48,816
I just broke up with her.

705
00:35:48,816 --> 00:35:49,455
It's just for us

706
00:35:49,455 --> 00:35:50,975
to train and play well in the future.

707
00:35:56,935 --> 00:35:57,735
break up

708
00:35:58,935 --> 00:35:59,935
Just to play games?

709
00:36:01,616 --> 00:36:02,655
Are you crazy?

710
00:36:02,975 --> 00:36:04,536
If you lose your girlfriend, you can look for her again.

711
00:36:04,816 --> 00:36:05,616
But to win the championship,

712
00:36:05,616 --> 00:36:07,415
we only have one chance in our lives.

713
00:36:09,616 --> 00:36:11,816
You've been with her for five years,

714
00:36:12,576 --> 00:36:13,495
but you broke up because of this.

715
00:36:14,896 --> 00:36:15,455
Are you worth it?

716
00:36:16,776 --> 00:36:17,856
Does your heart hurt?

717
00:36:17,856 --> 00:36:18,655
It hurts.

718
00:36:19,695 --> 00:36:20,616
It hurts so much.

719
00:36:21,136 --> 00:36:22,255
That's why I bought the wine.

720
00:36:22,296 --> 00:36:23,856
I want you to carry it for me.

721
00:36:27,576 --> 00:36:29,735
But no matter how painful it is, I have to go on.

722
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:32,336
Because this is my choice.

723
00:36:33,415 --> 00:36:34,136
I think it's worth it.

724
00:36:35,336 --> 00:36:36,136
What about your choice?

725
00:36:38,256 --> 00:36:40,296
You just threw away our dream like this?

726
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:46,896
You liar!

727
00:37:16,055 --> 00:37:17,135
You can't take this away.

728
00:37:19,256 --> 00:37:20,376
You don't care, do you?

729
00:37:21,015 --> 00:37:22,816
This is our first trophy.

730
00:37:23,495 --> 00:37:24,615
I can't leave some thoughts.

731
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:26,816
You don't deserve it.

732
00:37:28,336 --> 00:37:28,896
Give it to me.

733
00:37:29,256 --> 00:37:30,216
You don't even want your team anymore.

734
00:37:30,216 --> 00:37:31,495
Who are you to have it?

735
00:37:31,495 --> 00:37:31,736
Let go of me.

736
00:37:31,736 --> 00:37:32,336
You are,

737
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:33,376
you are a traitor.

738
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,055
Let go of me!

739
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:34,816
Me

740
00:37:49,135 --> 00:37:49,816
Are you satisfied?

741
00:38:04,455 --> 00:38:04,935
Chief Commandant.

742
00:38:07,216 --> 00:38:08,776
We are not young anymore.

743
00:38:10,816 --> 00:38:12,935
We can't take our dreams as reality anymore.

744
00:38:18,495 --> 00:38:19,455
If the team is gone,

745
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:22,656
you are no longer my captain.

746
00:38:24,455 --> 00:38:26,256
You don't have to mind my business in the future.

747
00:39:21,055 --> 00:39:21,656
Xiao Feng

748
00:39:22,015 --> 00:39:22,535
I'm here.

749
00:39:23,376 --> 00:39:24,575
Sit on a bowl of signature noodles

750
00:39:24,575 --> 00:39:25,495
at random,

751
00:39:25,495 --> 00:39:25,975
Okay.

752
00:39:35,896 --> 00:39:37,896
It's 11: 25 a. m. on August 8,

753
00:39:37,896 --> 00:39:39,535
2008,

754
00:39:39,535 --> 00:39:41,415
At the scene of the first round preliminaries of the men's 110 m hurdles

755
00:39:41,415 --> 00:39:42,656
at the Beijing Olympic Games,

756
00:39:42,656 --> 00:39:43,575
Xiao Feng, your noodles.

757
00:39:43,975 --> 00:39:44,376
Thank you.

758
00:39:44,856 --> 00:39:46,216
Why are you alone today?

759
00:39:46,296 --> 00:39:47,095
Where's Xu Wei?

760
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:47,696
He's dead.

761
00:39:47,935 --> 00:39:48,856
Okay, now we see

762
00:39:48,856 --> 00:39:50,736
Liu Xiang getting ready to go on stage.

763
00:39:50,736 --> 00:39:52,176
Liu Xiang once again represented China

764
00:39:52,176 --> 00:39:54,176
in the 110 m hurdles.

765
00:39:54,176 --> 00:39:56,055
This is a highly anticipated game.

766
00:39:57,975 --> 00:39:58,935
Where's Xu Wei?

767
00:40:00,376 --> 00:40:01,736
Okay, now we can see

768
00:40:01,736 --> 00:40:02,896
all the competitors are on the track.

769
00:40:03,495 --> 00:40:04,495
Liu Xiang is on the second lane,

770
00:40:04,896 --> 00:40:06,176
this is the last warm-up.

771
00:40:07,015 --> 00:40:08,575
But Liu Xiang doesn't feel well.

772
00:40:09,935 --> 00:40:18,696
Come on, Liu Xiang.

773
00:40:18,696 --> 00:40:19,935
All right. Let's get ready

774
00:40:20,455 --> 00:40:20,896
for the first shot.

775
00:40:21,736 --> 00:40:22,575
Someone ran away.

776
00:40:23,135 --> 00:40:24,935
Liu Xiang seemed to have a recurrence of his Achilles tendon injury

777
00:40:26,656 --> 00:40:27,975
and he walked off the track.

778
00:40:28,495 --> 00:40:29,455
He dropped out of the competition.

779
00:40:35,376 --> 00:40:36,816
The hurdler Liu Xiang

780
00:40:36,816 --> 00:40:37,856
withdrew from the competition due to injury.

781
00:40:39,776 --> 00:40:41,336
In those two years of sports news,

782
00:40:41,336 --> 00:40:42,495
I only remember two,

783
00:40:42,935 --> 00:40:44,176
One is Xiao Feng's team

784
00:40:44,176 --> 00:40:45,696
won the championship in the National Challenge.

785
00:40:45,736 --> 00:40:46,656
The other

786
00:40:46,656 --> 00:40:48,176
was Liu Xiang's withdrawal from the 110 m hurdles

787
00:40:48,176 --> 00:40:48,816
preliminaries,

788
00:40:49,015 --> 00:40:50,216
Liu Xiang has retired.

789
00:40:50,216 --> 00:40:51,935
The 110 m hurdles hasn't started yet.

790
00:40:51,935 --> 00:40:52,935
What kind of competition has he retired?

791
00:40:53,176 --> 00:40:54,376
It's been eleven years

792
00:40:54,376 --> 00:40:55,535
since Liu Xiang retired from the Olympics.
