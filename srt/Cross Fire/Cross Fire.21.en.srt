1
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,678
How are you? Is she all right?

2
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,118
I was joking.

3
00:02:48,118 --> 00:02:49,559
Who knew he really jumped?

4
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,559
You went too far.

5
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,118
Don't hit me.

6
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:54,639
Liuxu

7
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:57,038
If anything happens to Nezha,

8
00:02:57,038 --> 00:02:57,839
Xiaobei

9
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:58,878
I won't let you go.

10
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,518
Stop it. The doctor is out.

11
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,718
Doctor, how is he?

12
00:03:05,678 --> 00:03:06,558
The patient has a cracked right leg.

13
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,799
There are many soft tissue contusions.

14
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:09,999
But it's nothing serious.

15
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:12,119
From such a high place.

16
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:13,238
You're lucky.

17
00:03:27,918 --> 00:03:29,719
Captain, you must believe me.

18
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,958
I really didn't steal the money.

19
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,079
That fool would take the money.

20
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,238
The wallet is in the dorm.

21
00:03:33,238 --> 00:03:34,518
My brain doesn't lack strings.

22
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:35,638
Do you remember yesterday?

23
00:03:35,638 --> 00:03:37,198
I shot Liu Xu several times during the training.

24
00:03:37,278 --> 00:03:38,479
He must hold a grudge.

25
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,359
You framed me on purpose.

26
00:03:39,558 --> 00:03:40,318
Yes

27
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:41,799
Liu Xu has admitted that

28
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:42,159
Correct!

29
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:43,879
Don't fight with them.

30
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:44,998
Otherwise, we would have been reasonable.

31
00:03:44,998 --> 00:03:45,959
And become wronged.

32
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:49,998
Did you fight with them?

33
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:51,679
Then they did something wrong.

34
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:53,479
How can we do the same?

35
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,078
In this world,

36
00:03:54,078 --> 00:03:55,078
If you did something wrong,

37
00:03:55,078 --> 00:03:56,078
I'll do it with you.

38
00:03:56,078 --> 00:03:57,399
Wouldn't that be a mess?

39
00:03:58,198 --> 00:03:59,158
When I was lying in bed,

40
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:00,358
I've been thinking about

41
00:04:00,358 --> 00:04:02,039
Why should we love someone?

42
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,479
Why do you hate someone?

43
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:04,119
This problem

44
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,599
I can't find all the answers.

45
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:06,479
But I think

46
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,479
If you love someone,

47
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:09,158
Because I like something about him.

48
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:10,558
It's the same to hate someone.

49
00:04:10,638 --> 00:04:12,358
Because I hate something in him.

50
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:13,239
therefore

51
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:14,679
We can't be like them.

52
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:15,479
It will become

53
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,839
The way we hate ourselves.

54
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,798
If we don't want to become

55
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:18,798
I hate the most.

56
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,358
Then why should we do that?

57
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:21,638
In this world,

58
00:04:21,638 --> 00:04:23,198
Not all questions have answers.

59
00:04:23,198 --> 00:04:24,119
Why are birds flying?

60
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:24,918
Why are the flowers falling?

61
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,718
Why are we running so fast?

62
00:04:26,718 --> 00:04:28,239
You will be covered with dust.

63
00:04:28,239 --> 00:04:29,638
Then the dust has touched us.

64
00:04:29,638 --> 00:04:30,798
Or are we covered with dust?

65
00:04:30,798 --> 00:04:31,798
Then who are we?

66
00:04:31,798 --> 00:04:33,718
Where are we going?

67
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:35,839
It can't be from the Eastern Tang Dynasty.

68
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,718
To the west.

69
00:04:36,718 --> 00:04:37,599
These problems

70
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:39,638
Maybe I can't find the answer in my lifetime.

71
00:04:39,798 --> 00:04:40,399
But isn't that

72
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,039
What are we looking for in life?

73
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:42,839
That's enough.

74
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,519
Take a rest.

75
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:45,879
For a few more days.

76
00:04:46,198 --> 00:04:47,638
She will be discharged in a week.

77
00:04:48,758 --> 00:04:50,878
Is your friend so talkative?

78
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,119
Where's my phone?

79
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:53,598
Where's my phone?

80
00:04:53,758 --> 00:04:55,318
Who saw my phone?

81
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,399
Where's my phone?

82
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:56,799
other

83
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,919
I almost lost you.

84
00:05:03,758 --> 00:05:04,438
Correct!

85
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:05,359
Your short-haired

86
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:06,758
Is Miss Nurse still here?

87
00:05:06,998 --> 00:05:08,399
Where is the short-haired nurse?

88
00:05:09,318 --> 00:05:10,598
She's really nice.

89
00:05:10,598 --> 00:05:12,119
You're super careful.

90
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,598
I'm a little shy.

91
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:15,919
I told her to open her heart.

92
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,959
Don't hold everything in your stomach.

93
00:05:17,998 --> 00:05:19,038
Keep it in your stomach.

94
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:20,478
If you don't say it,

95
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:21,799
Who will understand what you think?

96
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,799
People don't know what you think.

97
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:23,839
I will definitely misunderstand you.

98
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,278
A misunderstanding will lead to a conflict.

99
00:05:25,438 --> 00:05:26,359
therefore

100
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,679
The best way to solve the problem

101
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,959
Is to say it all out.

102
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,878
Don't you think so?

103
00:05:30,318 --> 00:05:31,758
Li Hai Wa went for a recheck.

104
00:05:31,758 --> 00:05:32,399
Alright.

105
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,718
Here you are.

106
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,038
Do you think

107
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:42,679
He's a little weird today.

108
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,919
Not really.

109
00:05:44,558 --> 00:05:45,598
It's weird.

110
00:05:45,598 --> 00:05:46,519
That's right.

111
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,799
You look so talkative.

112
00:05:48,158 --> 00:05:48,998
When he talks,

113
00:05:48,998 --> 00:05:50,119
It's like a pancake fruit.

114
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:50,919
One by one.

115
00:05:50,998 --> 00:05:52,758
Did Xiao Bei break his head?

116
00:05:55,718 --> 00:05:56,399
Nezha, protection deity

117
00:05:56,878 --> 00:05:57,359
Nezha, protection deity

118
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,998
Nezha, protection deity

119
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:05,119
Oh, my God.

120
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:29,718
Brother Zha.

121
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,079
Play 20.

122
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:31,758
Brother Zha.

123
00:06:33,158 --> 00:06:34,278
Why do I think

124
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,878
His brain seems to be injured.

125
00:07:00,278 --> 00:07:03,839
The Coin Team.

126
00:07:08,158 --> 00:07:10,399
The Coin Team.

127
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,118
We succeeded.

128
00:07:12,118 --> 00:07:13,278
So handsome.

129
00:07:14,798 --> 00:07:17,278
Xiao Feng, we succeeded.

130
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:19,999
The Coin Team.

131
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,118
We succeeded.

132
00:07:22,118 --> 00:07:23,079
It worked.

133
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:25,399
We've become

134
00:07:26,798 --> 00:07:27,839
Take one.

135
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,079
Three, two.

136
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,278
The Coin Team.

137
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:36,999
It's such a big TV.

138
00:07:37,158 --> 00:07:38,798
The TV is bigger than the mural.

139
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:40,079
Xiao Feng, look at the view.

140
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:40,759
swimming pond

141
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,918
Really

142
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:44,718
Really

143
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:46,759
You can jump.

144
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,598
We succeeded.

145
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:53,999
It's not easy.

146
00:07:59,238 --> 00:07:59,999
It's hard.

147
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,478
Such a big room.

148
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:06,678
We live here.

149
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:10,678
It's so comfortable.

150
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,478
There's a remote control inside.

151
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:15,999
So many buttons.

152
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:19,478
This toilet seat is hot.

153
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:21,439
This is life.

154
00:08:22,118 --> 00:08:23,598
Hurry up.

155
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:24,839
I want to have a try.

156
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:29,199
And wash your face.

157
00:08:44,798 --> 00:08:45,879
Gold watch.

158
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:47,678
Where did you get it?

159
00:08:47,798 --> 00:08:48,959
Of course I bought it.

160
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,478
Thank you

161
00:08:52,358 --> 00:08:54,319
It must be fake.

162
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,959
It's really worth 100,000 yuan.

163
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:57,519
It's the same. You have to walk for 24 hours.

164
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,478
What's the difference?

165
00:08:58,678 --> 00:09:00,519
Don't waste money in the future.

166
00:09:01,158 --> 00:09:01,959
How much is it?

167
00:09:02,478 --> 00:09:03,999
Three hundred and ninety-nine.

168
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:05,839
Correct!

169
00:09:07,598 --> 00:09:08,559
Remember to change it.

170
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:10,199
this

171
00:09:10,358 --> 00:09:11,118
Electronic Watch

172
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:12,278
Or what?

173
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:13,278
How can I leave without power?

174
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,319
Wind power generation

175
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:16,759
So handsome.

176
00:09:20,118 --> 00:09:20,839
What's up

177
00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:24,959
Al-Amin

178
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,879
To wash your face.

179
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:36,038
You don't need to sleep on the floor.

180
00:09:36,038 --> 00:09:37,319
You can finally sleep naked.

181
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:38,358
Kirin, what are you doing?

182
00:09:38,358 --> 00:09:39,678
Control yourself.

183
00:09:39,678 --> 00:09:41,519
I can't help myself.

184
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,759
Can you wear some underwear?

185
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:44,199
Is wearing underwear naked?

186
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:50,559
Brothers,

187
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:52,399
Is there a swimming pool on the second floor?

188
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,238
No, no.

189
00:09:53,238 --> 00:09:53,798
I'm so sleepy.

190
00:09:53,918 --> 00:09:55,559
I heard there are many beautiful women in swimsuits.

191
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:56,478
Are you coming or not?

192
00:09:59,358 --> 00:10:00,079
So fast.

193
00:10:01,038 --> 00:10:01,999
他脱衣服

194
00:10:02,158 --> 00:10:02,918
Too fast

195
00:10:03,358 --> 00:10:04,478
She's really beautiful.

196
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:04,959
Yes

197
00:10:07,118 --> 00:10:08,158
swimming

198
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,678
Where are you, swimsuit lady?

199
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,559
Aren't they all for the competition?

200
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,319
You're lying.

201
00:10:19,598 --> 00:10:19,999
one

202
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:20,839
two

203
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:21,798
three

204
00:10:21,798 --> 00:10:22,278
go

205
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,559
Liar

206
00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:48,279
Why are you here?

207
00:11:48,598 --> 00:11:50,159
Didn't you say you wanted to swim?

208
00:11:53,398 --> 00:11:54,079
Stop swimming.

209
00:11:54,718 --> 00:11:56,039
I haven't swam for a long time.

210
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:56,998
I really want to swim.

211
00:11:56,998 --> 00:11:59,039
If you want to swim back to your room and take a bath,

212
00:11:59,159 --> 00:11:59,959
Stop looking.

213
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:06,598
It's lucky if she's okay.

214
00:12:06,598 --> 00:12:07,638
Are family.

215
00:12:07,638 --> 00:12:08,598
You don't have overnight feud.

216
00:12:08,598 --> 00:12:09,878
Stop fooling around.

217
00:12:09,878 --> 00:12:10,839
You're right.

218
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:11,799
Stop fooling around.

219
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:12,878
Nezha didn't steal the money.

220
00:12:12,878 --> 00:12:15,039
How did the wallet get to his bed?

221
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,159
It's just a misunderstanding.

222
00:12:16,638 --> 00:12:17,398
Everyone is here.

223
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,478
The misunderstanding

224
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:19,559
Make it clear.

225
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,478
There was a bit of friction during the training.

226
00:12:23,638 --> 00:12:24,679
I was too hasty.

227
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,358
To teach him a lesson.

228
00:12:25,358 --> 00:12:26,878
So you framed him.

229
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,598
And stuffed the wallet on his bed.

230
00:12:28,598 --> 00:12:29,079
Right?

231
00:12:29,758 --> 00:12:30,319
Yes

232
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:32,118
It's still not right.

233
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:33,919
Yes

234
00:12:35,998 --> 00:12:37,238
You have to pay the medical bills.

235
00:12:38,238 --> 00:12:39,439
And apologize to Nezha.

236
00:12:41,598 --> 00:12:42,559
Otherwise, it's not over.

237
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:46,439
Liuxu

238
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:51,679
Little brother

239
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,839
It's my fault this time.

240
00:12:52,998 --> 00:12:53,919
I'll make it up to you.

241
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,398
Back to you.

242
00:13:05,358 --> 00:13:05,919
Xiaobei

243
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,358
You said that An Lan

244
00:13:08,878 --> 00:13:10,079
What kind of boss?

245
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,839
Director of Operations of ES Gaming Events

246
00:13:13,598 --> 00:13:14,358
Many high officials.

247
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:15,758
In this way,

248
00:13:15,758 --> 00:13:17,839
The hottest esports event in the country

249
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:20,118
Is run and managed by her team.

250
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,679
It seems I have to scold her less.

251
00:13:24,518 --> 00:13:24,998
What about me?

252
00:13:24,998 --> 00:13:25,839
Did you find me?

253
00:13:26,118 --> 00:13:26,878
Not yet.

254
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:29,439
I've searched your teammates on the Internet.

255
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:30,998
Most of them have changed their jobs.

256
00:13:30,998 --> 00:13:32,679
There's only one person left in this circle.

257
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:34,079
Besides,

258
00:13:34,878 --> 00:13:36,159
You're quite close to An Lan.

259
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,398
You're close to An Lan.

260
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:38,358
who

261
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:39,598
Xu Wei.

262
00:13:40,358 --> 00:13:41,238
Lieutenant

263
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:42,478
He's

264
00:13:42,758 --> 00:13:44,598
Is the owner of the largest e-sports club in the country.

265
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:51,039
He's doing well.

266
00:13:51,638 --> 00:13:52,159
that

267
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:54,118
Didn't he get along with An Lan?

268
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,439
I don't know the details.

269
00:13:57,118 --> 00:13:58,118
Compared to them,

270
00:13:58,638 --> 00:13:59,559
I want to find you.

271
00:13:59,718 --> 00:14:00,679
I'll think of a way for you.

272
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:02,118
You can definitely find me.

273
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:03,319
What can I do?

274
00:14:03,478 --> 00:14:04,159
Go.

275
00:14:11,358 --> 00:14:11,839
Xiao Feng.

276
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:13,679
It's not time yet.

277
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,079
Yes?

278
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:29,758
There's this.

279
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:30,718
AnLan, AnLane.

280
00:14:30,718 --> 00:14:31,598
An Lan, look.

281
00:14:31,598 --> 00:14:32,839
This is my favorite one.

282
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,718
Although it's their early work,

283
00:14:34,998 --> 00:14:35,598
but

284
00:14:35,598 --> 00:14:37,358
Is the most talented one of them.

285
00:14:37,358 --> 00:14:38,398
It contains the song

286
00:14:38,398 --> 00:14:40,199
Was covered by countless people.

287
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:40,919
come

288
00:14:41,638 --> 00:14:42,518
I want you to feel

289
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,118
If there's only one song left in the world,

290
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,358
I hope this is the song.

291
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,238
It's beautiful.

292
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,679
But I still want to buy this one.

293
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:28,518
This is more suitable.

294
00:15:28,518 --> 00:15:30,439
When you're alone at night,

295
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:31,998
Have you been under a lot of pressure recently?

296
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:32,839
It's not me.

297
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,358
I want to buy it for Xiao Feng.

298
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,478
His eyes are dark recently.

299
00:15:36,718 --> 00:15:37,518
I think

300
00:15:37,518 --> 00:15:39,079
I was too nervous during the day.

301
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:40,279
I can't sleep at night.

302
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:42,118
This should help him relax.

303
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:44,998
You bought it for him.

304
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:48,238
You've been with Xiao Feng for so many years.

305
00:15:48,598 --> 00:15:49,478
He should

306
00:15:49,758 --> 00:15:51,118
How many hairs are there on your head?

307
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:52,238
You must have counted it clearly.

308
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,758
I'm not the louse on his head.

309
00:15:56,118 --> 00:15:58,518
I heard he had a girlfriend.

310
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:00,118
For a long time.

311
00:16:00,118 --> 00:16:01,398
But then I married someone else.

312
00:16:01,758 --> 00:16:02,358
Really?

313
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,238
You've learned a lot.

314
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,878
Can you tell me what that girl looks like?

315
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,238
It's all in the past.

316
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:12,638
Why are you talking about her?

317
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,319
Come on, boss.

318
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:14,799
I want to know

319
00:16:14,998 --> 00:16:17,679
What kind of girl does Xiao Feng like?

320
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:18,718
This is also 50.

321
00:16:18,718 --> 00:16:19,118
good

322
00:16:21,998 --> 00:16:22,998
Thank you, boss.

323
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:38,279
Master worker

324
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:41,718
Master worker

325
00:17:12,878 --> 00:17:13,518
I...

326
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:14,559
Hello

327
00:17:16,718 --> 00:17:17,559
Why are you here?

328
00:17:18,358 --> 00:17:19,238
Screw me, screw me.

329
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:20,039
Screw me up.

330
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,959
It's not my fault. Cheng Hao came up with the idea.

331
00:17:22,118 --> 00:17:22,959
He insisted on doing this.

332
00:17:23,238 --> 00:17:24,839
Brother Bei, please forgive me.

333
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,638
My hands are almost gone.

334
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,839
You deserve it.

335
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:29,839
You deserve it.

336
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,079
You deserve it.

337
00:17:31,478 --> 00:17:32,118
Go on.

338
00:17:32,758 --> 00:17:34,559
We haven't seen each other for a month.

339
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,559
You've lost a lot of weight.

340
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:35,998
Nothing

341
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:37,758
This time, I'll treat you to a big meal.

342
00:17:37,758 --> 00:17:38,758
I'll make it up to you.

343
00:17:40,398 --> 00:17:41,079
Xiaobei

344
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:43,159
Do you know that going to college

345
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:45,118
What is the first thing?

346
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,878
You must study hard.

347
00:17:47,878 --> 00:17:48,758
To get a scholarship.

348
00:17:48,758 --> 00:17:49,279
wrong

349
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,319
To find a boyfriend.

350
00:17:51,518 --> 00:17:53,518
This is comparable to the scholarship.

351
00:17:53,518 --> 00:17:54,839
More important.

352
00:17:57,439 --> 00:17:58,199
Come on.

353
00:17:58,439 --> 00:17:59,398
It's Chuge's own business.

354
00:17:59,398 --> 00:18:00,358
Don't worry about it.

355
00:18:00,718 --> 00:18:01,559
Namely

356
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,439
Besides,

357
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,478
Our Little Chu Ge

358
00:18:03,478 --> 00:18:05,238
Such a pure and lovely girl.

359
00:18:05,238 --> 00:18:06,839
Is the most popular in college.

360
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:07,839
Do you need to worry about it?

361
00:18:08,998 --> 00:18:10,518
You don't understand this.

362
00:18:10,718 --> 00:18:11,878
This man

363
00:18:11,878 --> 00:18:13,398
It's the same as the dishes in the university canteen.

364
00:18:13,398 --> 00:18:14,598
It's the same.

365
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:16,199
Although it tastes bad,

366
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:17,118
But you went late.

367
00:18:17,118 --> 00:18:18,638
He really doesn't have it.

368
00:18:18,638 --> 00:18:19,439
Do you understand?

369
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,159
is or isn't

370
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:22,998
I think Cheng Hao has a point.

371
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:26,638
No, don't listen to him.

372
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,039
Tell him to count.

373
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:29,478
There are several college graduates in his family.

374
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:35,998
That's it.

375
00:18:36,518 --> 00:18:37,679
I'll send you here.

376
00:18:37,998 --> 00:18:39,159
I want to go inside.

377
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,199
You can't leave.

378
00:18:44,638 --> 00:18:45,919
This school is so beautiful.

379
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,199
It's worth your hard work.

380
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:48,758
You came to the right place.

381
00:18:49,518 --> 00:18:50,238
That's right.

382
00:18:50,238 --> 00:18:51,559
I didn't expect to be here.

383
00:18:54,238 --> 00:18:54,959
Thank you.

384
00:18:56,398 --> 00:18:57,559
It's useless to say thank you.

385
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,959
You need to take action.

386
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,079
Remember to treat me.

387
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:02,718
Now,

388
00:19:02,718 --> 00:19:04,398
I can only afford to treat you to the canteen.

389
00:19:04,638 --> 00:19:05,398
When I make money,

390
00:19:05,598 --> 00:19:06,758
I'll buy you a nice meal.

391
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:08,238
Or the canteen.

392
00:19:08,718 --> 00:19:09,919
Put more money into the meal card.

393
00:19:10,118 --> 00:19:11,398
I will often come to harass you.

394
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,598
I really need to think about it.

395
00:19:13,598 --> 00:19:14,598
Cheng Hao's suggestion.

396
00:19:14,598 --> 00:19:15,718
We need to find a boyfriend.

397
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:17,478
difficult

398
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:18,919
Going to college requires a physical examination.

399
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,039
Who has no brain.

400
00:19:20,398 --> 00:19:20,919
You can't come in.

401
00:19:20,998 --> 00:19:21,959
Leave now.

402
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:23,878
Maybe later, which senior

403
00:19:23,878 --> 00:19:24,718
You're training me again.

404
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:25,718
Let's go.

405
00:19:28,638 --> 00:19:29,758
Call me if you need help.

406
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:30,518
good

407
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:38,638
Can you tell me

408
00:19:38,638 --> 00:19:39,598
How to get to the South Gate?

409
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:40,598
Are you still here?

410
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:42,439
to ask for directions

411
00:19:44,158 --> 00:19:45,158
Hurry up.

412
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:47,358
Are you done asking for directions?

413
00:19:57,198 --> 00:19:58,118
Southern monster, right?

414
00:19:58,118 --> 00:19:59,358
The main players sit on the top.

415
00:20:01,678 --> 00:20:02,759
The replacements sit here.

416
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:07,279
Don't block my camera.

417
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:21,638
The cultivator, right?

418
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:23,279
You are over there.

419
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:25,759
Lu Xiao Bei,

420
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:26,839
Why are you here?

421
00:20:27,678 --> 00:20:28,918
Our team has a game today.

422
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:30,559
Your team

423
00:20:32,438 --> 00:20:33,398
Now?

424
00:20:34,158 --> 00:20:35,638
We are the replacements for the southern monsters.

425
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:36,878
Don't worry.

426
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:38,759
If we don't play today,

427
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,719
Can't play semi-professional league.

428
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:42,279
It's good to be a spectator on the sidelines.

429
00:20:44,158 --> 00:20:45,239
Your legs are fine.

430
00:20:47,198 --> 00:20:47,999
Unexpectedly,

431
00:20:48,358 --> 00:20:49,079
to stand up

432
00:20:49,598 --> 00:20:50,479
Taller than you.

433
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,559
It's a pity that your team is getting limp.

434
00:20:53,198 --> 00:20:53,759
good

435
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:54,839
For you.

436
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:57,198
I will take good care of the southern monster today.

437
00:20:58,598 --> 00:20:59,999
Come. Everyone is ready.

438
00:20:59,999 --> 00:21:01,358
The live show will begin soon.

439
00:21:01,358 --> 00:21:02,158
Hurry up

440
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:05,839
Change your tactics.

441
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:06,598
Three Eleven.

442
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,719
Focus on quick attack.

443
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:10,878
Didn't you say you'd slowly consume them last night?

444
00:21:10,878 --> 00:21:11,598
I changed my mind.

445
00:21:12,198 --> 00:21:14,158
We haven't practiced fast attack these days.

446
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:16,559
Do as I say.

447
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:26,479
go

448
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:43,918
Go to B.

449
00:21:50,878 --> 00:21:52,519
You stay here and I'll take care of you.

450
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:53,678
good

451
00:22:14,678 --> 00:22:15,678
Amazing

452
00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:19,598
How did you keep it?

453
00:22:19,598 --> 00:22:20,319
You should leave now.

454
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:21,799
I was attacked later.

455
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,358
The three of them hit me.

456
00:22:23,358 --> 00:22:24,198
How can I guard it?

457
00:22:24,198 --> 00:22:24,918
Am I going to die?

458
00:22:24,918 --> 00:22:26,079
I told you to stick to it.

459
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:27,638
What does that mean?

460
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:30,039
You must protect it for me.

461
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:31,198
Do you want to fight?

462
00:22:31,198 --> 00:22:32,479
Go down if you don't want to.

463
00:23:16,198 --> 00:23:16,999
Amazing

464
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:19,839
Gate A has an ambush.

465
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:20,678
There are two more inside.

466
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:42,918
Amazing

467
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:43,999
pretty

468
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:54,719
Let's go.

469
00:23:59,279 --> 00:23:59,999
This is the first time

470
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:01,559
The most boring match.

471
00:24:02,118 --> 00:24:03,158
You're almost asleep.

472
00:24:04,158 --> 00:24:05,438
In order to play professional league,

473
00:24:05,438 --> 00:24:07,398
To replace this garbage team.

474
00:24:07,398 --> 00:24:08,598
I'm so moved.

475
00:24:08,598 --> 00:24:09,878
In order to win,

476
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:11,918
You are not good at this.

477
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:12,999
I'm also touched.

478
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,638
This is so beautiful.

479
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:23,358
Let's take a photo together.

480
00:24:23,358 --> 00:24:24,559
I'll take photos for you.

481
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:25,598
Stop filming.

482
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:26,559
Come in and take a photo.

483
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:27,519
Brothers!

484
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:28,438
Can you take a photo for us?

485
00:24:28,438 --> 00:24:28,999
Thank you

486
00:24:29,358 --> 00:24:30,198
come

487
00:24:30,198 --> 00:24:30,759
Hurry up.

488
00:24:34,678 --> 00:24:35,878
Everyone, look at this.

489
00:24:37,198 --> 00:24:39,279
Three, two, good.

490
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:40,759
Thank you

491
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:41,519
Let me see.

492
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:42,839
It's beautiful.

493
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,039
Are they...

494
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:45,999
The team that wants to compete with us.

495
00:24:46,198 --> 00:24:46,638
go

496
00:24:46,638 --> 00:24:47,839
Come on. Let's warm up.

497
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:48,559
I'm leaving now.

498
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:50,839
The pace must be out of that momentum.

499
00:24:54,479 --> 00:24:55,079
sorry

500
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:55,958
We need to check

501
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:57,358
Your belongings

502
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:58,239
No, wait.

503
00:24:58,479 --> 00:25:00,198
The team didn't check it.

504
00:25:00,678 --> 00:25:01,598
We have the certificate.

505
00:25:01,598 --> 00:25:02,479
Why are you investigating us?

506
00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:04,118
This is what the competition committee wants us to do.

507
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:05,799
I want to kill

508
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:06,878
And carry out key inspections.

509
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:08,319
Let's welcome

510
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:10,479
The Black Fire Team from Northeast Division.

511
00:25:14,398 --> 00:25:16,039
They want to investigate. Let them investigate.

512
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:21,118
This is a typical psychopath.

513
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:23,079
Lady, get your bag and check it.

514
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,559
She's the leader and doesn't play.

515
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,398
About what?

516
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,319
And your coat.

517
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:28,279
Everyone in your team will be checked.

518
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:29,079
Please cooperate.

519
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:36,918
Could you please hurry up?

520
00:25:36,918 --> 00:25:38,198
The competition will begin soon.

521
00:25:39,198 --> 00:25:40,039
What is this?

522
00:25:40,398 --> 00:25:42,519
This is my walkman. It's for music.

523
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:44,239
We need to open it for inspection.

524
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:46,118
What's the point of a walkman?

525
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:47,398
The tournament committee has told us

526
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:49,519
For the electronic equipment of your team,

527
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:50,719
We need to focus on

528
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,158
If you think something is wrong,

529
00:25:52,158 --> 00:25:53,239
Put your walkman here.

530
00:25:53,239 --> 00:25:54,638
Can we go to the competition first?

531
00:25:55,158 --> 00:25:55,719
can

532
00:25:55,719 --> 00:25:55,999
Don't.

533
00:25:55,999 --> 00:25:56,918
When the inspection is over,

534
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:57,479
you

535
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:59,638
Don't open it for me.

536
00:26:00,118 --> 00:26:00,719
Hello, hello.

537
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:02,358
I'm the leader of the Steel Coin Team.

538
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,279
The game is about to begin.

539
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:05,198
But your security staff

540
00:26:05,198 --> 00:26:06,279
And stopped us at the door.

541
00:26:06,678 --> 00:26:08,479
If you don't let it go, it will delay the game.

542
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:09,398
Then we refuse to enter.

543
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:10,678
And file a complaint.

544
00:26:10,678 --> 00:26:12,239
And according to the schedule,

545
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:14,039
There will be a rematch.

546
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,279
Thousands of spectators in the stadium

547
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:17,319
Waiting for the game.

548
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:19,158
Do you really want this?

549
00:26:23,158 --> 00:26:25,198
Break it up a bit more.

550
00:26:25,198 --> 00:26:26,878
Hurry up. We have a competition.

551
00:26:27,598 --> 00:26:28,559
You can pass.

552
00:26:28,598 --> 00:26:29,039
fast

553
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:29,438
go

554
00:26:29,438 --> 00:26:30,158
fast

555
00:26:34,438 --> 00:26:35,678
Go first. Go inside.

556
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:36,839
That's enough.

557
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:37,678
Don't bother with them.

558
00:26:38,479 --> 00:26:40,678
Now the entrance is from Ning Jiang Team.

559
00:26:40,678 --> 00:26:42,319
Who just passed the Hell Team.

560
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:43,279
The Coin Team.

561
00:26:44,999 --> 00:27:02,398
Cheat

562
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:10,638
Come on

563
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:25,839
Why is my mouse not working?

564
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:29,759
AnLuan

565
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:30,719
Captain, the mouse is not working.

566
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:32,118
Bring me the mouse.

567
00:27:32,118 --> 00:27:32,999
Use mine.

568
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:36,279
Fight hard.

569
00:27:36,678 --> 00:27:37,319
Fight hard.

570
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:41,799
What about

571
00:27:42,198 --> 00:27:42,759
Will it work?

572
00:27:43,358 --> 00:27:44,799
This is also intermittent.

573
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,198
She must have fallen just now.

574
00:27:46,438 --> 00:27:46,918
Nothing

575
00:27:47,398 --> 00:27:47,958
It's OK.

576
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:49,638
It's okay.

577
00:27:49,719 --> 00:27:50,239
come

578
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:50,999
Come on

579
00:27:52,118 --> 00:27:54,279
Please make the final preparations.

580
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:55,678
The game will start soon.

581
00:28:00,198 --> 00:28:00,999
Ming, go to A.

582
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:02,479
Kirin Sand, go to B.

583
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:02,878
good

584
00:28:02,878 --> 00:28:03,799
Captain, follow me.

585
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:04,479
OK

586
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:05,999
I'm stuck in door B.

587
00:28:09,958 --> 00:28:10,839
A There's someone.

588
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:12,198
Return to point A.

589
00:28:12,198 --> 00:28:12,958
Let's cover.

590
00:28:13,999 --> 00:28:14,719
A Trail Support

591
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:15,279
She's here.

592
00:28:16,358 --> 00:28:16,918
I can't hold it.

593
00:28:16,918 --> 00:28:17,559
Hurry up.

594
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:21,799
pretty

595
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:22,759
Return to point A.

596
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:23,559
I'm charging.

597
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:24,319
Captain, slow down.

598
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:24,958
Lieutenant

599
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:27,598
Flash bomb

600
00:28:29,638 --> 00:28:30,598
A is lying in wait.

601
00:28:30,598 --> 00:28:32,079
Point A is full of people.

602
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:33,878
I've installed a bag.

603
00:28:36,678 --> 00:28:37,799
Look at the back.

604
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,319
I'm charging.

605
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:39,319
Xiao Feng, hit me.

606
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:39,918
There's an ambush at the middle gate.

607
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:41,198
Kirin, behind you.

608
00:28:42,878 --> 00:28:43,918
Play with me.

609
00:28:43,918 --> 00:28:44,759
Gather and prepare to attack.

610
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:46,878
Calm down.

611
00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:49,719
I dare not go out. It's all human.

612
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:50,358
Change the pistol.

613
00:28:50,358 --> 00:28:51,279
To check the bag.

614
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:51,598
I know.

615
00:28:51,598 --> 00:28:52,839
Don't panic. It's okay.

616
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:53,598
I rushed.

617
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:54,319
I went there.

618
00:28:59,999 --> 00:29:01,438
pretty

619
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:06,958
Go home. You cheated.

620
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:08,678
Go back.

621
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,279
Nothing

622
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:13,719
We're fine.

623
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:14,839
It was fine in the first round.

624
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:15,479
There's a chance.

625
00:29:16,158 --> 00:29:16,918
Come on

626
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:17,999
This one.

627
00:29:17,999 --> 00:29:18,799
Ming, go to point A.

628
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:19,839
I'm on the middle road with Kirin.

629
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:21,158
Captain, go to B with Lao Sha.

630
00:29:21,158 --> 00:29:22,279
Received

631
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:25,079
President Guo.

632
00:29:25,678 --> 00:29:27,118
The monster of the South loses again.

633
00:29:27,438 --> 00:29:28,678
It's hard to recover it.

634
00:29:29,158 --> 00:29:30,719
I've talked to Liu Xu and them.

635
00:29:30,918 --> 00:29:32,079
They will adjust.

636
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:34,958
Training at 11: 30.

637
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:36,519
I didn't get up until 2 p.m.

638
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,118
I don't think that

639
00:29:38,118 --> 00:29:39,198
Can win the game.

640
00:29:40,198 --> 00:29:42,158
I know you've been acting

641
00:29:42,158 --> 00:29:43,398
Have a problem with Liu Xu and them.

642
00:29:43,678 --> 00:29:45,039
But a game is a game.

643
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:46,839
You can't get personal.

644
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:49,039
Let's talk about the competition.

645
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,678
You've watched the team training recently.

646
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,239
We've been winning the main players.

647
00:29:52,438 --> 00:29:54,279
You played well.

648
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:55,839
Just keep fighting.

649
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:57,279
The training is for the competition.

650
00:29:57,918 --> 00:29:59,358
Next game is Langya League.

651
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:01,438
We defeated them in Hundred Cities.

652
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:02,878
Let's go.

653
00:30:03,118 --> 00:30:04,239
Definitely more confident.

654
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:06,398
I'll tell you again.

655
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:08,319
I don't like changing generals at the last minute.

656
00:30:08,479 --> 00:30:09,638
Liu Xu and the others can do it.

657
00:30:09,638 --> 00:30:11,358
Just be a substitute.

658
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,479
If you think you want more pay,

659
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,999
Can we talk?

660
00:30:15,638 --> 00:30:16,958
We really want a chance.

661
00:30:17,158 --> 00:30:18,719
But we want to help the team.

662
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:21,039
The southern monster is on the edge of the cliff now.

663
00:30:21,918 --> 00:30:22,999
If you take another wrong step,

664
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:24,759
There's really no chance.

665
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:26,759
I know.

666
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:29,079
Liu Xu is experienced in the competition.

667
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,319
That's it.

668
00:30:36,438 --> 00:30:37,358
Stop fighting.

669
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:39,598
What are you doing

670
00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:40,958
Stop it.

671
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:42,118
Alright, forget it.

672
00:30:42,118 --> 00:30:43,039
What fight?

673
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:46,719
I'll attract him.

674
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:47,519
You hit him.

675
00:30:48,918 --> 00:30:49,678
Another one at B.

676
00:30:49,678 --> 00:30:50,158
It's stable.

677
00:30:50,158 --> 00:30:50,999
punching

678
00:30:51,678 --> 00:30:52,279
go

679
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:59,358
Cheat

680
00:31:00,678 --> 00:31:02,479
Get the out of here.

681
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:08,999
Cheat

682
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:09,999
Get lost.

683
00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:11,559
Get out of here.

684
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:13,118
It's just a dish.

685
00:31:13,118 --> 00:31:13,559
Yes

686
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:14,319
Nonsense

687
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:15,479
We didn't cheat.

688
00:31:15,479 --> 00:31:16,519
Ming, stop him.

689
00:31:16,878 --> 00:31:17,999
Please mind your words and actions.

690
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:19,198
Pay attention to my behavior.

691
00:31:19,198 --> 00:31:21,118
Did you hear what they said?

692
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:22,799
Who are you to judge me?

693
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:23,638
Go back to your seat.

694
00:31:23,638 --> 00:31:24,519
sorry

695
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:25,198
We must pay attention to

696
00:31:25,198 --> 00:31:25,958
sorry

697
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:26,918
Pay attention.

698
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:29,398
Hello

699
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,398
Could you please maintain order on the scene?

700
00:31:31,398 --> 00:31:32,638
It's disturbing our players.

701
00:31:32,638 --> 00:31:34,719
The audience likes who to support who

702
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:35,759
We can't control this.

703
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:36,878
You can't swear.

704
00:31:36,878 --> 00:31:38,039
This is a personal attack.

705
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:39,118
After all, it's a competition.

706
00:31:39,118 --> 00:31:40,598
Everyone is in a normal mood.

707
00:31:40,918 --> 00:31:41,598
What do you think?

708
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:43,598
Unicorn

709
00:31:44,598 --> 00:31:45,638
It's so bullying.

710
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:46,319
I know.

711
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:47,519
I feel the same way as you.

712
00:31:47,678 --> 00:31:49,559
They want to see us embarrass.

713
00:31:49,678 --> 00:31:50,878
If you want them to shut up,

714
00:31:50,878 --> 00:31:52,239
We must win this game.

715
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:53,438
Come on, team.

716
00:31:55,678 --> 00:31:56,398
Hurry up.

717
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,039
Hold still

718
00:31:58,438 --> 00:31:59,719
One, two, three.

719
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:00,759
The Coin Team.

720
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:01,079
Come on

721
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:01,678
Hold on.

722
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:02,918
Go to the bathroom.

723
00:32:02,918 --> 00:32:03,519
go

724
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:10,358
It's okay to lose.

725
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:11,999
but

726
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:13,958
It's too hard to lose.

727
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:15,398
Now is the key.

728
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:17,438
How are we going to play the next two rounds?

729
00:32:17,598 --> 00:32:19,719
An Lan just complained to the tournament committee.

730
00:32:20,118 --> 00:32:21,279
I didn't give an explanation.

731
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,319
useless

732
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:24,438
Breaking the drum and beating it.

733
00:32:24,438 --> 00:32:25,638
Who can control so many mouths?

734
00:32:25,638 --> 00:32:27,559
Let's forget about these useless things.

735
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:28,839
What's wrong?

736
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:29,999
I can't stand such a setback.

737
00:32:29,999 --> 00:32:31,438
What can we do in the future?

738
00:32:31,918 --> 00:32:32,438
captain

739
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:33,759
What are you thinking?

740
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:35,799
I was thinking

741
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,479
What is the opponent thinking now?

742
00:32:37,479 --> 00:32:38,719
If we want to win it back,

743
00:32:38,719 --> 00:32:40,279
You can't fall into the opponent's mind.

744
00:32:40,598 --> 00:32:41,519
What are you saying?

745
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,839
We don't start the second half with quick attacks.

746
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:44,319
Yes

747
00:32:44,918 --> 00:32:45,719
Let's do the next one.

748
00:32:45,719 --> 00:32:46,678
Stuck position

749
00:32:46,678 --> 00:32:47,839
And attack after red seconds.

750
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:49,118
You've been dragging your feet.

751
00:32:49,118 --> 00:32:50,039
When the opponent reacts,

752
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:51,198
Let's play a faster round.

753
00:32:51,198 --> 00:32:51,799
that's right

754
00:32:52,358 --> 00:32:53,799
Do you know why I like to play games?

755
00:32:54,878 --> 00:32:56,799
To compete with the opponent.

756
00:32:58,519 --> 00:32:59,519
Come on

757
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:00,999
Come on

758
00:33:31,598 --> 00:33:33,158
Captain, what's going on?

759
00:33:33,158 --> 00:33:34,118
How about Block B?

760
00:33:34,118 --> 00:33:35,079
Who didn't see them.

761
00:33:35,198 --> 00:33:35,918
What about your side?

762
00:33:35,918 --> 00:33:36,839
So are we.

763
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:37,638
Be careful.

764
00:33:37,719 --> 00:33:38,279
Received

765
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:12,719
how could that be?

766
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,678
Why didn't you fight?

767
00:34:13,678 --> 00:34:14,719
Hurry up.

768
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:18,479
Go search for them.

769
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:30,918
No one is on the middle road.

770
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:31,598
There's no one on B.

771
00:34:31,598 --> 00:34:32,598
There's no one on A Alley.

772
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:34,039
Stand by.

773
00:34:35,438 --> 00:34:35,999
Received

774
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:50,358
When are you going?

775
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:34,839
Why are you stopping again?

776
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:36,519
I think he's too scared to fight.

777
00:35:37,398 --> 00:35:38,719
They wouldn't dare to come.

778
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:39,878
Ten seconds left.

779
00:36:04,118 --> 00:36:04,799
action

780
00:36:15,479 --> 00:36:17,438
pretty

781
00:36:19,398 --> 00:36:20,398
They dragged and fought.

782
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,678
Let's play fast.

783
00:36:21,678 --> 00:36:22,918
We should change the tactics.

784
00:36:22,918 --> 00:36:23,878
We still play fast.

785
00:36:23,878 --> 00:36:24,918
Okay, copy that.

786
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,118
fast

787
00:36:29,118 --> 00:36:30,999
These retreating turtles haven't come out yet.

788
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:31,759
fast

789
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:16,799
The Gangfen Team just changed to a fast attack.

790
00:37:16,799 --> 00:37:18,199
It's very effective.

791
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:18,998
The Black Fire Team thought

792
00:37:18,998 --> 00:37:20,518
They won't come out.

793
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:21,319
Result

794
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:23,239
The Steel Coin Team will attack the middle road.

795
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:23,918
Point A, go.

796
00:37:23,918 --> 00:37:25,799
The Black Fire Team lost a lot last round.

797
00:37:25,799 --> 00:37:27,159
You want to win back.

798
00:37:27,438 --> 00:37:28,478
Why can't you see anyone?

799
00:37:28,478 --> 00:37:29,438
Old Sha attacked him.

800
00:37:29,438 --> 00:37:29,719
Old sand.

801
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:30,159
left

802
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:31,319
I saw it.

803
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:32,679
We ran into each other.

804
00:37:32,759 --> 00:37:33,839
24K, take one away.

805
00:37:35,279 --> 00:37:36,239
pretty

806
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:36,839
Hold on.

807
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:37,558
In the middle.

808
00:37:37,558 --> 00:37:39,319
Seven also stole one.

809
00:37:40,518 --> 00:37:41,839
The Black Fire Team is too anxious.

810
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:42,599
You seem to be anxious.

811
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:43,918
Not only can't you eat the hot tofu,

812
00:37:43,918 --> 00:37:44,958
It's easy to burn your mouth.

813
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:45,958
What a thief!

814
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:48,078
Do you think the Steel Coin Team will play fast?

815
00:37:48,078 --> 00:37:49,878
They came out last.

816
00:37:49,878 --> 00:37:51,159
You think they're holed up at home?

817
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:52,558
Suddenly, he's charging in the middle.

818
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:53,759
The Black Fire Team fell into the pit.

819
00:37:53,759 --> 00:37:55,038
Can't climb up.

820
00:37:55,038 --> 00:37:57,078
The tactics of the Steel Coin Team

821
00:37:57,078 --> 00:37:57,759
Has played a role.

822
00:37:57,759 --> 00:37:59,159
A very good effect.

823
00:37:59,159 --> 00:37:59,998
Hold on.

824
00:38:03,518 --> 00:38:04,759
We didn't cheat.

825
00:38:04,759 --> 00:38:06,358
To be indifferent to life and death.

826
00:38:06,358 --> 00:38:07,599
If you don't agree, just do it.

827
00:38:08,038 --> 00:38:08,958
Disobey the reality. Touch it.

828
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:10,319
We didn't cheat.

829
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:12,078
If you don't agree, just do it.

830
00:38:12,558 --> 00:38:13,719
Don't touch it.

831
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:14,839
Right. Didn't you say you cheated?

832
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:15,799
And keeps a low profile.

833
00:38:15,799 --> 00:38:16,759
And keeps a low profile.

834
00:38:17,078 --> 00:38:18,199
Let's shake hands with them.

835
00:38:20,878 --> 00:38:21,599
Don't be angry.

836
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:24,199
You guys are really good.

837
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:25,078
We learn from you.

838
00:38:25,518 --> 00:38:26,398
You played well.

839
00:38:26,398 --> 00:38:26,839
Thank you for your hard work.

840
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:27,679
You played very well.

841
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:45,958
north

842
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:47,038
There's a fight.

843
00:38:47,038 --> 00:38:48,199
I heard that Yi Er 0 has come.

844
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:49,119
It's not that serious.

845
00:38:49,558 --> 00:38:51,119
Has gone to the community clinic.

846
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,078
Can we still play Langya League tomorrow?

847
00:38:53,078 --> 00:38:53,799
You can fight.

848
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:55,119
However

849
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:56,998
tomorrow

850
00:38:58,518 --> 00:38:59,518
Let's go.

851
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:01,679
Really?

852
00:39:03,319 --> 00:39:04,279
Really?

853
00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:05,239
Don't fool me.

854
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:07,199
Captain, if you lie to me,

855
00:39:07,518 --> 00:39:09,078
I really just want to dance again.

856
00:39:09,078 --> 00:39:11,319
You won't get good results.

857
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:13,839
You jump, I jump.

858
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,119
If you don't believe me,

859
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,279
Ask President Guo yourself.

860
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:17,918
Really?

861
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,398
Really

862
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,679
The five of us can go together.

863
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:25,639
We can replace those who are injured.

864
00:39:25,998 --> 00:39:26,839
Fill in the hole.

865
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:28,478
No

866
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:30,078
Tomorrow, the five of us

867
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:31,918
All of you.

868
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:36,199
complete personnel

869
00:39:40,438 --> 00:39:41,038
to wait a moment

870
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:42,159
How did you manage that?

871
00:39:43,398 --> 00:39:44,719
You threatened President Guo.

872
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:45,719
I

873
00:39:46,038 --> 00:39:47,558
Avail oneself of the opportunity to get in

874
00:39:47,558 --> 00:39:49,078
Take advantage of another's perilous state

875
00:39:50,878 --> 00:39:52,199
Xiaobei

876
00:39:52,558 --> 00:39:53,918
If you're a little sister,

877
00:39:53,918 --> 00:39:55,199
I'll get a license with you.

878
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:57,358
Stop

879
00:39:57,358 --> 00:39:58,599
Stay there.

880
00:39:58,599 --> 00:39:59,878
As long as there is Chu Ge,

881
00:39:59,878 --> 00:40:01,998
Xiao Bei, you'll never have a chance.

882
00:40:02,478 --> 00:40:04,078
Do not

883
00:40:04,078 --> 00:40:05,159
greasy

884
00:40:06,958 --> 00:40:07,679
Beisang

885
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:09,759
Let's study tomorrow's tactics.

886
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:31,478
girl

887
00:40:32,398 --> 00:40:34,799
You've been here since the gym.

888
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:36,478
You failed to follow me all the way.

889
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,038
Don't scare them.

890
00:40:39,518 --> 00:40:41,078
She wants to see us.

891
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:43,038
I'm not here for you.

892
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:44,878
I'm here to

893
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:47,918
I'm here to see him.

894
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:07,358
I heard you broke it today.

895
00:41:07,878 --> 00:41:08,799
This is for you.

896
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,438
There are some songs I like in it.

897
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:14,438
I don't know if you like it.

898
00:41:14,918 --> 00:41:16,038
How can this work?

899
00:41:16,279 --> 00:41:17,159
It's so expensive.

900
00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:18,358
I can't.

901
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:20,239
Old sand.

902
00:41:20,438 --> 00:41:21,558
They gave you something.

903
00:41:21,558 --> 00:41:22,159
Take it.

904
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:24,078
Thank you

905
00:41:25,038 --> 00:41:25,679
you're welcome

906
00:41:25,918 --> 00:41:26,878
I'm your fan.

907
00:41:27,478 --> 00:41:28,199
My name is Qiqi.

908
00:41:35,558 --> 00:41:36,078
AnLuan

909
00:41:36,078 --> 00:41:37,759
Did you pay for this?

910
00:41:45,078 --> 00:41:45,958
Sure.

911
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:48,358
Qiqi should be our team.

912
00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:49,839
The first real fan.

913
00:41:49,998 --> 00:41:51,239
Stop it.

914
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:01,518
He's here.

915
00:42:07,878 --> 00:42:08,839
I thought

916
00:42:08,958 --> 00:42:10,639
I also have fans to give me things.

917
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:16,078
you

918
00:42:16,078 --> 00:42:17,438
It doesn't match.

919
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,518
At least we need another dictionary.

920
00:42:24,799 --> 00:42:26,998
You're thoughtful.

921
00:42:27,279 --> 00:42:28,358
I can't sleep at the other place.

922
00:42:28,558 --> 00:42:30,279
And listen to it as a lullaby at night.

923
00:42:30,279 --> 00:42:31,878
Listen to these songs.

924
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:34,159
I'll check the words in a few days.

925
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:37,038
English class representative.

926
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:38,639
Or

927
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:40,799
Help me with my lessons.

928
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:18,558
Xiao Feng.

929
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,078
You two go over there.

930
00:43:58,078 --> 00:44:00,358
Don't leave out any details.

931
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:01,239
Roger that, Route Team.

932
00:44:45,398 --> 00:44:46,319
Hello, officer.

933
00:44:46,759 --> 00:44:47,639
Are you the boss?

934
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:48,239
I'm

935
00:44:48,918 --> 00:44:49,998
Did you fix it here?

936
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:51,239
White hatchback

937
00:44:51,558 --> 00:44:53,759
The car that hit the left door badly?

938
00:44:53,759 --> 00:44:54,799
Why is there a case?

939
00:44:55,518 --> 00:44:56,319
You...

940
00:44:56,958 --> 00:44:58,119
Please show me the registration file.

941
00:44:58,119 --> 00:44:58,839
good

942
00:44:59,599 --> 00:44:59,998
this

943
00:44:59,998 --> 00:45:01,078
There are cars in the hatchback.

944
00:45:01,279 --> 00:45:02,719
But not the white one.

945
00:45:03,398 --> 00:45:06,319
The left back door wasn't damaged.

946
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:09,398
All the repaired cars are registered here.

947
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,159
I don't stay in this shop every day.

948
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:14,078
you

949
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:15,078
Come here

950
00:45:21,078 --> 00:45:22,159
Why are you hiding from me?

951
00:45:22,398 --> 00:45:23,759
I just changed the tire.

952
00:45:23,759 --> 00:45:24,679
I'll move the floor.

953
00:45:24,878 --> 00:45:26,119
Otherwise, the boss will scold me again.

954
00:45:26,679 --> 00:45:27,759
Did you repair it recently?

955
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:29,239
The white hatchback.

956
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:31,679
The car that hit the left door badly?

957
00:45:31,998 --> 00:45:33,358
I'm a new busboy.

958
00:45:33,958 --> 00:45:35,478
It's not my turn to fix the car.

959
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:37,319
He just came here. He's an apprentice.

960
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:42,839
It's okay. Get back to work.

961
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:01,199
Boss

962
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:02,799
If anything happens,

963
00:46:02,799 --> 00:46:03,599
Report in time.

964
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:04,038
good

965
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:20,518
Big oyster.

966
00:46:20,518 --> 00:46:21,719
Take more.

967
00:46:24,958 --> 00:46:25,998
Give me a place.

968
00:46:28,518 --> 00:46:29,599
You're right.

969
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:30,398
Give it to me.

970
00:46:30,918 --> 00:46:32,159
What are you eating? Sweet potato.

971
00:46:32,438 --> 00:46:33,478
Come on.

972
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:37,358
It tastes great.

973
00:46:38,279 --> 00:46:39,038
Where is Chang Sha?

974
00:46:39,159 --> 00:46:40,358
Why didn't you see him?

975
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:41,558
On a date.

976
00:46:42,438 --> 00:46:43,119
Who are you dating?

977
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:44,038
Female fans.

978
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:45,918
The game is tomorrow morning.

979
00:46:45,918 --> 00:46:46,878
I will run the map later.

980
00:46:46,878 --> 00:46:47,799
He has to put more energy

981
00:46:47,799 --> 00:46:48,958
In the competition.

982
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:50,398
Who are you eating?

983
00:46:50,398 --> 00:46:52,239
It's rare that a girl likes Lao Sha.

984
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:54,159
You must let him win the victory.

985
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:54,759
is or isn't

986
00:46:55,558 --> 00:46:56,319
I'm asking you.

987
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:58,478
That girl is pretty.

988
00:46:59,279 --> 00:47:01,398
Chang Sha is really a fool.

989
00:47:01,398 --> 00:47:02,639
Are you a little touched?

990
00:47:07,438 --> 00:47:08,358
Who is it?

991
00:47:08,558 --> 00:47:09,398
And also a female fan.

992
00:47:10,358 --> 00:47:11,358
What female fans?

993
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:12,639
My home called.

994
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:22,518
Hello? What is it?

995
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:24,478
Let me tell you something.

996
00:47:25,319 --> 00:47:27,319
The police came to check our garage today.

997
00:47:29,918 --> 00:47:31,038
The car you replaced

998
00:47:31,038 --> 00:47:32,038
I hid it for you.

999
00:47:32,279 --> 00:47:32,799
Thank you

1000
00:47:34,038 --> 00:47:36,679
Does anyone else know about this?

1001
00:47:36,998 --> 00:47:38,478
Don't you worry about me?

1002
00:47:39,279 --> 00:47:40,719
This is for you.

1003
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:41,958
I'll keep it for you.

1004
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:42,918
Take care of it for me.

1005
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:44,279
Okay, no problem.

1006
00:47:44,998 --> 00:47:45,998
But you have to

1007
00:47:46,078 --> 00:47:47,119
Give me some more money.

1008
00:47:49,958 --> 00:47:50,759
How much do you want?

1009
00:47:51,078 --> 00:47:52,078
Three thousand.

1010
00:47:53,558 --> 00:47:54,998
What? It's too much.

1011
00:47:54,998 --> 00:47:55,358
I'm telling you,

1012
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:56,998
I'll clean this up for you.

1013
00:47:56,998 --> 00:47:58,599
Even if the police find you one day,

1014
00:47:59,558 --> 00:48:00,239
There's no evidence.

1015
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:00,759
is or isn't

1016
00:48:00,998 --> 00:48:02,878
You spent 3,000 yuan to buy an innocent.

1017
00:48:03,078 --> 00:48:04,078
It's worth it.

1018
00:48:04,518 --> 00:48:06,719
Fine, 3,000 yuan.

1019
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:11,398
I miss it now.

1020
00:48:11,398 --> 00:48:12,599
Let's go to this barbecue stand.

1021
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:13,679
To eat raw oysters.

1022
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:15,239
Then you threw up everything you ate just now.

1023
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:28,319
You go ahead
