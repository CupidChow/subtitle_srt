1
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:31,420
Come on

2
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,059
Hold on.

3
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,219
Yes

4
00:02:36,899 --> 00:02:37,460
Come on

5
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,380
Is it OK?

6
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,419
can

7
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,300
come

8
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,580
go

9
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:49,819
Come on

10
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,419
That's enough.

11
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:06,379
That's all for today.

12
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,419
I can keep practicing.

13
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,940
You lied down before standing up.

14
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,820
The training of athletes should be increased gradually.

15
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,739
Take your time.

16
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:17,699
I don't have time to take it easy.

17
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:52,940
Xiao Bei is still awake.

18
00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:58,619
What's wrong? What happened?

19
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,459
I can't play with you if I'm fine.

20
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,300
I'm telling you,

21
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:04,259
I learned a new magic trick.

22
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:05,140
It's very interesting.

23
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:05,539
Look.

24
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:06,539
Pick a card.

25
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:07,739
I can make it disappear.

26
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:08,379
Look.

27
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:09,379
Pick a card.

28
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:10,179
Look.

29
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:12,420
Go back, Cheng Hao.

30
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,459
I'm doing my homework.

31
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:17,899
Xiaobei

32
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,019
Are you mad at me?

33
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,659
Why should I be mad at you?

34
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,099
It's all because of me.

35
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,420
And the team broke up.

36
00:04:28,739 --> 00:04:30,060
It's not your problem.

37
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,220
Don't take everything on yourself.

38
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,340
Because of me.

39
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,300
I was so bad.

40
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:35,659
You're holding us back.

41
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:36,819
And then I'm still begging for help.

42
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:38,580
Otherwise, it wouldn't have come to this.

43
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,219
Go back, Cheng Hao.

44
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,459
I have to go to school tomorrow.

45
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,219
Xiao Bei, we've been brothers for so many years.

46
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:46,179
Don't lie to me.

47
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,140
Because of me.

48
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,499
The team broke up because of me.

49
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,939
What's the point of saying this now?

50
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:54,619
Xiaobei

51
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,459
sorry

52
00:04:57,059 --> 00:04:58,459
The team we finally built

53
00:04:58,459 --> 00:04:59,779
I don't want it to fall apart.

54
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,100
You're the captain.

55
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,300
You must have a way.

56
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,100
Think of something.

57
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,100
Do whatever you want.

58
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,019
I'll listen to you.

59
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,059
ChengHao

60
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,059
I don't know what to do.

61
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:13,619
You have a problem.

62
00:05:13,619 --> 00:05:14,660
They have problems too.

63
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,140
I have a problem too.

64
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:17,540
I'm the captain.

65
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,700
But I really have no choice this time.

66
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,540
How about this?

67
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:21,580
You know magic?

68
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,499
You can change the team back.

69
00:05:22,499 --> 00:05:23,540
I'll give you the captain.

70
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,700
What's up

71
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:42,300
I think I heard Cheng Hao's voice.

72
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:42,779
Where is he?

73
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:45,260
Has left.

74
00:05:45,739 --> 00:05:46,300
son

75
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,619
What happened?

76
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:48,580
I didn't get good grades.

77
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:50,300
Or a friend?

78
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,499
There's a conflict.

79
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:53,619
Both

80
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,739
in my opinion

81
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,820
It's you who have problems as the captain.

82
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,820
I'm a captain, not a parent.

83
00:06:03,179 --> 00:06:03,899
I can't do that for them.

84
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:05,260
Everyone's problem will be paid.

85
00:06:07,739 --> 00:06:09,339
When I was a soldier,

86
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:12,260
The first monitor and the second monitor are quite competitive.

87
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:13,459
And treat your soldiers

88
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:14,739
It's very strict.

89
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,219
But every time the whole company fights,

90
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:18,899
That class will never beat Class 2.

91
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:20,619
why

92
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:24,140
A monitor treats soldiers as winning pieces.

93
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:25,899
The second monitor is different.

94
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:27,219
All the soldiers

95
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:28,499
As your own brothers.

96
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,860
That's the difference.

97
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:32,980
I want to be a good captain.

98
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,459
Than being a parent.

99
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,899
Think about it.

100
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,860
Are you done?

101
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,739
On behalf of the Gangfen Team, I'm sincere.

102
00:06:58,739 --> 00:06:59,660
To apologize to you.

103
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:02,300
What I need now is not your apology.

104
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,020
You don't need me now.

105
00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:06,540
Do you have the heart to leave the five of us alone?

106
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,220
Leave.

107
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,059
We are not...

108
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:10,460
In the same world.

109
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,379
Look.

110
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,980
We are not the same dream.

111
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,660
Everyone has different dreams.

112
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:22,059
Your dream is to take the postgraduate exam.

113
00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:23,340
My dream is to play games.

114
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,699
Although our dreams are different,

115
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:25,900
But the purpose is the same.

116
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:27,259
To make myself better.

117
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:29,020
So people with different dreams can be together.

118
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,819
Right?

119
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,059
Don't play games with me.

120
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,179
I beg you to leave now.

121
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:33,819
There are many cameras in our school.

122
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:34,379
I

123
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:35,980
Can you stop making trouble for me?

124
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:37,819
I'm not here to make peace.

125
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,059
I'm here to give you an offer.

126
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,139
On behalf of the team, I officially invite you.

127
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,259
As our leader.

128
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:47,739
You can hire someone else.

129
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,980
The sponsorship contract I pulled last time

130
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,660
Take it.

131
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,220
You can handle the rest.

132
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,300
Make a condition.

133
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,259
I'll do whatever you want.

134
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:02,139
I'll pay all your water and electricity bills.

135
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:02,579
Alright?

136
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,220
Do not

137
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:05,739
Then add a curtain.

138
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:07,980
You like the kind with a veil.

139
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,739
I don't care.

140
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:09,860
Are you forcing me?

141
00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:11,100
That's it.

142
00:08:11,179 --> 00:08:12,259
And a washing machine.

143
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:13,259
Is that sincere enough?

144
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,660
Washing Machine

145
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:17,420
It's useless to give me a fighter.

146
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,220
As long as you come back,

147
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,860
I've made yogurt for you all your life.

148
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,340
Let me ask you something.

149
00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:51,739
When others challenge you,

150
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,660
Are you still fighting?

151
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:53,980
I swear,

152
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,020
You just did it without speaking.

153
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,619
what

154
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:56,220
No, no.

155
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,220
You won't do anything.

156
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,259
Then you bragged.

157
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:00,499
To win the national championship.

158
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:01,819
Can you cash it?

159
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:02,900
I'm trying.

160
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,900
I have a very good job now.

161
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:11,020
If you don't work hard,

162
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,340
I won't forgive you.

163
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:16,939
You promised me.

164
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,980
I have one last question.

165
00:09:22,619 --> 00:09:23,139
You know,

166
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,739
What do you want?

167
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:28,259
To buy me yogurt forever.

168
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,179
Really?

169
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,220
Even if you live to be 100,

170
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,300
As long as you want yogurt,

171
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,100
I'll buy it for you right away.

172
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,699
Alright?

173
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,460
Take care of this contract, leader.

174
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,179
Take it.

175
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:42,139
Take it.

176
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:43,819
Alright.

177
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,100
This is the premise of my being the leader.

178
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:48,860
Draw up three chapters of law

179
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,420
You must obey it unconditionally.

180
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:55,020
first

181
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,699
Be serious.

182
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:01,699
You can't fight with people outside.

183
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:02,540
second

184
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:04,900
You can't fight with your own people.

185
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:05,780
Third

186
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,100
I haven't thought about it.

187
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,980
You can make it up at any time.

188
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,059
I have no problem.

189
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,460
We're fine.

190
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,660
Why are you looking at me?

191
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:22,379
I have no problem with that.

192
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:24,860
Welcome.

193
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,739
I'll give it to you in the Internet cafe.

194
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,059
For a challenge.

195
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,860
The day after tomorrow, at 10 am,

196
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,460
Ning Jiang's troops have been wiped out.

197
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,379
There's no opponent.

198
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,139
Who are you fighting with?

199
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,220
Do you dare to try?

200
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,980
Refuse nobody

201
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,980
Where is she?

202
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,860
Hurry up.

203
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,699
She's already on the train.

204
00:10:54,619 --> 00:11:05,900
On the train,

205
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,339
Hello, senior.

206
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,699
We are the Black Hole Effect Team.

207
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:14,859
Thank you for your invitation.

208
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,020
Hello.

209
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,380
We're a team of coins.

210
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,740
The Coin Team.

211
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,660
I'm Chang Sha 24k.

212
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,859
I've heard a lot about you.

213
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:24,979
Uncles,

214
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,339
I'll teach you how to cross fire.

215
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:29,260
I've done everything for you.

216
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,260
It's obvious.

217
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:32,540
We are here to learn.

218
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:34,459
This is what An Lan said.

219
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:35,660
A very powerful team?

220
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,939
Don't you bully children?

221
00:11:37,219 --> 00:11:38,219
Did you make a mistake?

222
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,699
See the real Zhang.

223
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:41,380
Don't be nervous.

224
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,339
sit

225
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:42,819
come

226
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,380
Be careful.

227
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,579
See what tactics they have.

228
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,500
A bunch of nerds.

229
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,380
What tactics?

230
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:12,099
To fight this kind of opponent.

231
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:13,380
It's a waste of time.

232
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:18,500
It's not that easy.

233
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:20,620
He did very well in Jiangsu Division.

234
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,740
Be careful. It's a smoke bomb.

235
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,099
Don't fall into the trap.

236
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:23,900
Boring

237
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,819
You can't do that.

238
00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:26,620
What does An Lan think all the time?

239
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:27,699
Be nervous.

240
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,780
As expected, you are all great gods.

241
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:34,020
admire

242
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,099
It's okay.

243
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:35,859
For a while

244
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,140
We'll give you two games.

245
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,380
This is 10 to ZERO.

246
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,620
We won't be honored.

247
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,260
Right?

248
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,420
everybody

249
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,699
It seems that the level of the coin

250
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:47,579
Can't make it to Windows XP.

251
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:48,579
Even 98 can't run.

252
00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:49,579
The last one.

253
00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:50,780
To confuse these innocent old people.

254
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,939
Fix the most arrogant hair first.

255
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:53,339
Received

256
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:02,540
The other side is charging A.

257
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,420
Come and support me.

258
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,219
Stay here.

259
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:05,740
I'll go to Package A.

260
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:42,140
Only lost one game.

261
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,219
It's not the end of the world.

262
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:45,059
Captain, next, follow me to Point A.

263
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:46,620
come

264
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,459
go

265
00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:51,979
on

266
00:13:51,979 --> 00:13:52,740
That's not right.

267
00:13:53,219 --> 00:13:54,260
They have one in the middle.

268
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:54,900
One is at point A.

269
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:55,740
What about the other three?

270
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,140
There's no one at B.

271
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:57,819
Then where is it?

272
00:13:57,859 --> 00:13:59,020
Ming, go to point B.

273
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,780
Their main attack is B.

274
00:13:59,979 --> 00:14:00,420
good

275
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,420
Make up for it.

276
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,380
Don't panic.

277
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,699
You're the only one left.

278
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:08,420
The last one.

279
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,380
Thank you, senior.

280
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,420
Get up. Hurry up.

281
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,260
get up

282
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:28,540
Senior, you are nothing.

283
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,219
It's a long journey.

284
00:14:29,219 --> 00:14:30,900
Why don't you have dinner?

285
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:31,939
We have class tomorrow.

286
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:33,219
I won't stay in Ningjiang too much.

287
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,140
Thank you for your hard work.

288
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:41,179
what?

289
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:42,300
The dishes are not delicious enough.

290
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:43,699
To add more dishes.

291
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:48,179
What competition?

292
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:49,179
Team Sky.

293
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,540
The semi-finals.

294
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:55,300
Do you think that

295
00:14:55,819 --> 00:14:56,900
Do you have a chance?

296
00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:00,300
Their running and shooting skills are perfect.

297
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,699
It's probably hanging.

298
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:05,140
That's the level.

299
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,459
If you run into him,

300
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,219
I can tell who tortured whom.

301
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,540
Yes

302
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,620
If the captain can play like a semi-final,

303
00:15:14,859 --> 00:15:16,740
You can fight with them.

304
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:19,059
You can't always expect to outperform.

305
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,939
The biggest problem we have now

306
00:15:20,979 --> 00:15:22,540
You underestimated your opponent.

307
00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:23,620
to speak frankly

308
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,099
You overestimated yourself.

309
00:15:27,979 --> 00:15:28,579
Now?

310
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:30,819
The Grand National is still a while away.

311
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,459
If you have made up your mind,

312
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,979
East China and North China

313
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,660
The best team in each division.

314
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,140
I can make an appointment for you one by one.

315
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,380
It's not about winning or losing.

316
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,620
But to learn the advantages of each team.

317
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,459
To accumulate enough tactical methods.

318
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,020
You really want to fight them one by one?

319
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,819
We're old hands.

320
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,620
This time, I'll go back to the wok.

321
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:57,300
What are you afraid of?

322
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,620
And lose a few more now.

323
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,620
To lose less in the National Challenge.

324
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:09,819
It's worth it.

325
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,179
You want to play football?

326
00:17:41,939 --> 00:17:43,099
Who says you can't play?

327
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:44,620
A man has to be

328
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,740
Unrealistic confidence.

329
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,740
Come and play with us, okay?

330
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,740
Is it fun to play football?

331
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:20,859
Interesting

332
00:18:21,219 --> 00:18:23,140
Will you come again?

333
00:18:23,939 --> 00:18:24,540
good

334
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,660
I will come to you whenever I am free.

335
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:27,579
very good

336
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:28,459
Cheng Hao has to go to school.

337
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:29,660
I don't have any friends.

338
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:31,260
We are friends.

339
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,020
right or wrong?

340
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:32,540
Well

341
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:33,219
come

342
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:34,859
Okay, we're home.

343
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,059
Do you want me to send you up?

344
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:36,900
Nothing

345
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,099
I can go up myself.

346
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:39,219
Go back.

347
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:40,099
Are you sure?

348
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:40,620
determine

349
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:41,380
You can go back.

350
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:42,780
Of course

351
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:43,660
Then I'm leaving.

352
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,260
bye-bye

353
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:44,900
bye-bye

354
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,260
Oh, my God. What?

355
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,260
Just like a ghost.

356
00:19:19,939 --> 00:19:20,620
What are you doing?

357
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,780
Waiting for a boy named Lu Xiao Bei.

358
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:23,979
To complain to me.

359
00:19:25,579 --> 00:19:26,819
I'm not here to complain.

360
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,700
You are the closest to your brother.

361
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:35,940
That mouth.

362
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,740
It's as hard as iron.

363
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:39,579
If it's my brother,

364
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,980
What would he do now?

365
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:43,740
Follow me.

366
00:19:57,619 --> 00:19:58,780
When you're free,

367
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:01,260
I'm willing to sit here by myself.

368
00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:03,220
Have a drink.

369
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:20,980
I really envy you.

370
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,579
The five of you are willing to join hands.

371
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,260
Unlike us.

372
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:26,980
Lacking spirit of cooperation

373
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:28,260
We have our own conflicts.

374
00:20:28,819 --> 00:20:29,700
And had a fight.

375
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:32,260
We are all young.

376
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,260
Who hasn't lost their temper?

377
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,260
but

378
00:20:37,659 --> 00:20:39,059
Everyone's body

379
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,579
Has its own problems.

380
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:42,859
Your brother can be the captain.

381
00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:44,460
Because he can find people around him.

382
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,180
All the advantages.

383
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:46,379
He can make his teammates

384
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:47,579
And become better and stronger.

385
00:20:47,859 --> 00:20:49,700
Five fingers are long and short.

386
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:53,020
Clenching together is the fist.

387
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:55,339
I know the truth.

388
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,579
But I really don't know.

389
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,379
How can we get the five of us

390
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,740
Make a fist.

391
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,819
Do you remember Xiao Feng?

392
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,379
Their team.

393
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:06,139
Just dismissed several times.

394
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,020
But in the end,

395
00:21:08,139 --> 00:21:09,899
Why are they still the national champions?

396
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:12,379
Because he knows his teammates.

397
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,419
He knows what his teammates need.

398
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:15,980
What does his teammates lack?

399
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,339
I remember that every time after the match,

400
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,700
He went back to watch the video.

401
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,460
It's not just about yourself.

402
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,819
Mainly to see his teammates.

403
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,980
To see where his teammates made the mistake.

404
00:21:26,139 --> 00:21:27,700
Where is the progress of his teammates this time?

405
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,180
And write it down in a notebook.

406
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,099
To share with you.

407
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:31,339
Do you think

408
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,300
With such a captain,

409
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,540
Can the players not unite?

410
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,180
You want me to leave early?

411
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:57,579
That's right.

412
00:21:57,619 --> 00:21:59,419
I don't want you to stay any longer.

413
00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:02,700
I didn't expect that

414
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,099
You were the one who sent me away.

415
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:07,740
Life is long.

416
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,540
You never know what will happen next second.

417
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:11,059
Maybe you went back today.

418
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:12,500
You'll break up with your boyfriend tomorrow.

419
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,020
And bought a bus ticket the day after tomorrow.

420
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,819
Are you looking for a beating?

421
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:17,059
You want a beating?

422
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:20,940
Take care

423
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:26,460
Nezha, protection deity

424
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,020
Why are you here?

425
00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:32,500
Your one is broken.

426
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,780
Thank you, little Nezha.

427
00:22:37,379 --> 00:22:39,260
If you have time, come to visit me in Shanghai.

428
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,379
Take care.

429
00:22:55,659 --> 00:22:56,339
Are you really leaving?

430
00:22:58,419 --> 00:22:59,619
I bought some fruit for you.

431
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:00,339
It's done.

432
00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:01,780
Eat on the way.

433
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,099
Old fashioned.

434
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,180
Let's take a group photo.

435
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:22,059
good

436
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:22,980
Will be separated.

437
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,059
Take a picture as a souvenir.

438
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:25,020
come

439
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,059
One or two

440
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:30,579
Xiaobei

441
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,619
I didn't take any pictures with me.

442
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,020
It's too boring.

443
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,020
Seriously,

444
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,659
I don't want to see you in my life.

445
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:38,980
You tricked me into coming to Ningjiang.

446
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,099
And broke up halfway.

447
00:23:40,339 --> 00:23:42,220
And sneaked to the Langya League.

448
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:43,139
Are you really

449
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:44,059
Professional e-sports player.

450
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:45,059
There's no hope.

451
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:46,020
To be a professional jerk.

452
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,099
Is more than enough.

453
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,220
I agree with you.

454
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,300
I agree.

455
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:50,700
Agree!

456
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,180
It's the first time I've seen you two working together.

457
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,220
I did go to the Langya League.

458
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,379
But not to change jobs.

459
00:23:58,379 --> 00:23:59,740
To spy on the military.

460
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,859
Look in the group.

461
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,859
What do you mean?

462
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,899
I filmed their training video.

463
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,059
Take a look.

464
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:08,619
It's okay. I'll cover you.

465
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:09,300
There's no one in the back.

466
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:11,139
Their co-defense is very powerful.

467
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,859
If we attack a single point,

468
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,659
Will definitely be attacked.

469
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:14,899
We can find more spots at the same time.

470
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,540
At the same time.

471
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,500
Catch them off guard.

472
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,139
Impossible to guard against

473
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,700
I think we can do more.

474
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,099
But first, you have to follow me.

475
00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:20,780
good

476
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,339
no problem

477
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:31,139
Stay.

478
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:32,859
You're right.

479
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:34,740
I'm an .

480
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:36,819
I'm a selfish and childish bastard.

481
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,020
Do you know why

482
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,139
The team name should be Team Continuing?

483
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,780
Because that's my brother's favorite word.

484
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,740
I used to play games.

485
00:24:48,139 --> 00:24:48,980
I want to help my brother

486
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,460
The unfinished e-sports road.

487
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:54,339
So I just want to win, not lose.

488
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:55,859
But then I found that

489
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,339
Losing is not so horrible.

490
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,619
Even if you lose everything,

491
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,619
Did I have a second chance?

492
00:25:02,859 --> 00:25:03,780
Because of you,

493
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,059
With my teammates,

494
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:06,059
No matter how many times,

495
00:25:06,619 --> 00:25:08,180
I have the courage to continue.

496
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:11,059
Stay.

497
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:12,139
Continue

498
00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:13,819
After each game,

499
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:15,859
The word will appear on the screen.

500
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,500
As long as you have a coin,

501
00:25:17,859 --> 00:25:19,260
The game goes on.

502
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:20,339
Nezha, protection deity

503
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,859
WangKai

504
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:23,899
ChengHao

505
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:25,619
Su Jiayi.

506
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,819
Now this coin

507
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:27,980
In our own hands.

508
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:31,139
I don't want to admit defeat casually.

509
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:32,819
I believe

510
00:25:33,379 --> 00:25:34,419
If the five of us

511
00:25:34,419 --> 00:25:35,300
I'm sure I can.

512
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,020
We can definitely continue to fight.

513
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:46,379
I know.

514
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:49,339
I'm not a good captain.

515
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,500
But I still want to ask you.

516
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,899
Are you willing to continue?

517
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,139
I want to form a team.

518
00:26:13,379 --> 00:26:14,540
Okay, as long as you open your mouth,

519
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,579
There's nobody in Ningjiang.

520
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:16,460
I can't find it.

521
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:21,940
You must be Nezha.

522
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,659
My name is Lu Xiao Bei.

523
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:23,980
Are you interested?

524
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,899
Form a team with us.

525
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,780
Don't you want to be a professional e-sports player?

526
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,220
think

527
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:35,099
WangKai

528
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:36,540
You lost your job now.

529
00:26:36,619 --> 00:26:37,500
The team has also broken up.

530
00:26:37,819 --> 00:26:38,940
Why don't you go to my place?

531
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,419
I really want to be your friend.

532
00:26:40,659 --> 00:26:41,379
Come to our team.

533
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:42,460
Let's play professional together.

534
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,740
I promise you won't regret it.

535
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,059
S+1

536
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,419
The master I hired

537
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,300
Lu Xiao Bei,

538
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,899
Except us,

539
00:26:52,899 --> 00:26:53,700
Who else is there?

540
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:55,099
You're here.

541
00:26:55,099 --> 00:26:55,980
Give it a try.

542
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,500
Su Jiayi, goddess of e-sports,

543
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,619
In such a bad environment,

544
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:00,780
Spring into fame

545
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,139
This person is my favorite.

546
00:27:12,139 --> 00:27:15,260
One, two, three.

547
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:02,980
Unicorn

548
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,260
I told you to look for the video. Did you find it?

549
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,500
I'm looking for it. Don't rush.

550
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,180
hurry up

551
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:06,700
Correct!

552
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,020
Old sand.

553
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,659
This is nice.

554
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,180
How many times have I told you?

555
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,339
Remember to report it.

556
00:28:11,339 --> 00:28:12,180
You know what?

557
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,260
You can't be so bored.

558
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,619
For example, if you die,

559
00:28:14,619 --> 00:28:15,579
The man behind hit you.

560
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:16,700
How should you report it?

561
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,780
They're coming.

562
00:28:17,819 --> 00:28:19,139
They're coming.

563
00:28:19,139 --> 00:28:19,659
Do you know

564
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:20,059
Well

565
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:21,419
What?

566
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:22,059
Shout!

567
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:25,659
The attack is coming.

568
00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:27,059
Rushed in from the back.

569
00:28:27,099 --> 00:28:27,780
I found it.

570
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,899
Point A, point B, wave.

571
00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:29,540
Really?

572
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,180
I've been searching for a long time.

573
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,379
You don't know how to search.

574
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:33,540
There are plenty of resources.

575
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:52,579
Unicorn

576
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:54,220
I asked you

577
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,180
Find me that video?

578
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,899
At first, I was quite sure.

579
00:28:56,899 --> 00:28:58,740
It's obvious that

580
00:28:58,859 --> 00:29:00,579
This is called a diversion.

581
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,300
We can use this, too.

582
00:29:02,379 --> 00:29:03,780
This guy is tough.

583
00:29:04,139 --> 00:29:05,940
From the back.

584
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,419
Rushed in from the back.

585
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:08,020
I've sent all the officials

586
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,460
We found the video and the commentary.

587
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,579
And it's all translated into the text document.

588
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,780
What are you looking at?

589
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:17,139
Nothing.

590
00:29:17,139 --> 00:29:17,740
We're studying

591
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,460
tactics

592
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:22,379
What are you doing?

593
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,139
I didn't rob it.

594
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:23,700
Give it to me.

595
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,139
No way

596
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,099
Then show me.

597
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:25,980
You can't read it.

598
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:26,780
Let's watch it together.

599
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:28,059
That's even worse.

600
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:28,540
why

601
00:29:28,659 --> 00:29:29,300
You can't read it.

602
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:29,899
Why don't you stop?

603
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,220
Are you hiding something from me?

604
00:29:31,339 --> 00:29:32,059
No

605
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:33,300
We really study tactics.

606
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:33,819
Right?

607
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,339
Ming and the others kept it from me.

608
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:36,419
Are you going to hide it from me?

609
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,700
Al-Amin

610
00:29:38,859 --> 00:29:39,980
I have a stomachache.

611
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:41,020
I need to use the restroom.

612
00:29:41,659 --> 00:29:42,379
I was about to take a dump.

613
00:29:42,379 --> 00:29:42,659
No way

614
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:43,020
I want to see it.

615
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:43,659
Don't rob the toilet with me.

616
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:44,139
why

617
00:29:44,139 --> 00:29:44,500
I can't.

618
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:44,980
The toilet is out of paper.

619
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,780
I'll get them some paper.

620
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,180
Changsha

621
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,659
It's going to rain outside.

622
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:49,740
I'll get the clothes.

623
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,540
Old sand.

624
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:51,540
Xiao Feng, show me.

625
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:51,859
I can't.

626
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:52,460
Show me.

627
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,099
If you give it to me, I'll watch it.

628
00:29:54,099 --> 00:29:54,980
You scoundrel.

629
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:01,300
Xiao Feng, you bastard.

630
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,300
Everyone,

631
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:17,980
aggregate

632
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:22,940
Stand at ease!

633
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,500
where?

634
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,099
Attention

635
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,260
End the gun.

636
00:30:30,379 --> 00:30:31,020
to squat down

637
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,700
to crawl forward

638
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,460
to crawl forward

639
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:41,659
What's the most important thing in the competition?

640
00:30:41,659 --> 00:30:42,460
It's not technology.

641
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,460
It's not experience.

642
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:44,540
Not to mention luck.

643
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:45,619
But the will.

644
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,740
The two teams will play until the end.

645
00:30:48,139 --> 00:30:49,659
Is often a battle in one breath.

646
00:30:49,819 --> 00:30:52,020
We should train our bodies into iron.

647
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,940
To train our will into steel.

648
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:54,700
therefore

649
00:30:54,859 --> 00:30:56,180
Our slogan is

650
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,940
As long as you don't die,

651
00:30:58,339 --> 00:30:59,260
I'll practice in the dead.

652
00:31:04,579 --> 00:31:05,619
What are you doing

653
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:06,619
get up

654
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,419
get up

655
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:09,859
get up

656
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:11,740
get up

657
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:46,940
Hello, everyone.

658
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:48,659
Where I am today,

659
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:50,819
A map of black towns crossing the line of fire

660
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,139
I'm An Lan, the leader of the Steel Coin Team.

661
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:55,099
Today, I'm going to introduce

662
00:31:55,099 --> 00:31:56,819
All the members of our team

663
00:31:56,819 --> 00:31:57,819
First, the first one.

664
00:31:57,819 --> 00:31:58,540
You don't have to say much.

665
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,460
please see ...

666
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,059
See that?

667
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:04,940
The perfect marksmanship.

668
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,899
Perfect appearance.

669
00:32:05,899 --> 00:32:06,379
he

670
00:32:06,379 --> 00:32:08,740
Is Xiao Feng, the captain of our team.

671
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,300
Hello, everyone.

672
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,500
I'm Xiao Feng, the captain of the Steel Coin Team.

673
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:15,659
I'll take it directly.

674
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,099
Then I will

675
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:17,460
It's up to me.

676
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,020
Let me introduce to you.

677
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,180
The members of our team

678
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,540
Come on. Let's look over here.

679
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:22,659
this

680
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:24,659
Is the sniper of our team.

681
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,579
Old sand.

682
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,700
It's so Buddhist and casual.

683
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:31,460
right or wrong?

684
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,139
Also

685
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,899
Are our two commandos.

686
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,180
Kirin and Xu Wei

687
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:38,700
Why are you hitting me?

688
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,059
Sorry

689
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,339
They might be a little crazy today.

690
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,300
A little crazy.

691
00:32:43,579 --> 00:32:45,859
Next, I'm going to introduce

692
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,540
sorry

693
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:47,579
Father and mother.

694
00:32:47,819 --> 00:32:48,500
Did you see me?

695
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,260
I'm on TV.

696
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:49,899
I'm Xu Wei.

697
00:32:49,899 --> 00:32:50,659
I'm your son.

698
00:32:50,659 --> 00:32:50,980
Xu Wei.

699
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:51,980
Hello, everyone. I'm the Kirin.

700
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,339
I'm the Kirin.

701
00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:52,899
I'm single.

702
00:32:52,899 --> 00:32:53,579
I'm on TV, Dad.

703
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:54,419
I don't have a girlfriend.

704
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:55,300
I'm a commando.

705
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,419
Your son is a commando.

706
00:32:58,579 --> 00:32:58,899
That

707
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,220
There's another member I haven't introduced to you.

708
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,300
Is our scout.

709
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:01,940
Al-Amin

710
00:33:02,379 --> 00:33:03,059
Al-Amin

711
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:04,579
Ming, say something.

712
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,059
I'm doing reconnaissance.

713
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:12,740
It takes courage to compete.

714
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,180
A lot of people think courage is not being afraid.

715
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:15,899
actually

716
00:33:15,899 --> 00:33:17,220
Only those with brain injury

717
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,339
So I won't be scared.

718
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:19,339
For example, Lao Sha,

719
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,260
Make fun of

720
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:22,180
Today,

721
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:22,940
We need to do a training.

722
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:25,859
Don't be afraid.

723
00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:28,180
Be not afraid of

724
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,260
The way we train,

725
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,740
So that the players can adapt to it.

726
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,659
The feeling of fear.

727
00:33:37,659 --> 00:33:39,500
And eliminate the fear of

728
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,540
All kinds of mental disorders.

729
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,740
There are all kinds of bad effects.

730
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,220
And enhance the competition

731
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,460
The ability to adapt and endure.

732
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,180
One, two, three.

733
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:51,740
start

734
00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:06,740
Get set

735
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:11,980
punching

736
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:30,180
Come on.

737
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,180
What? I have something to tell you.

738
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,700
What can't you say inside?

739
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,419
Go ahead.

740
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,500
I know how much weight I own.

741
00:34:40,819 --> 00:34:41,579
I've thought about it.

742
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,819
I won't hold you back.

743
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,500
Zero is a free man.

744
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:45,740
I've talked to him.

745
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,379
He can come any time.

746
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:48,540
What about you?

747
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:49,740
I can be the backup.

748
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,059
I can also help you.

749
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:51,940
And can be a bodyguard.

750
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,379
As long as it's something I can do,

751
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,180
Both

752
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:55,099
Give me your phone.

753
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:55,940
I'll enter his number.

754
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:56,740
Are you sure?

755
00:34:57,099 --> 00:34:57,899
Give me your phone.

756
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,460
Now the Langfang League is poaching him.

757
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,579
The next step is to be his teammates.

758
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:07,579
Or an opponent?

759
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:10,300
It's up to you.

760
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,059
hurry up

761
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,659
Hello, Zero.

762
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:21,740
I'm the captain of the Continuing Team.

763
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,540
Lu Xiao Bei,

764
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:23,180
what?

765
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,619
Here's the thing.

766
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,139
Let's continue our team.

767
00:35:26,139 --> 00:35:27,579
Can't afford the main position.

768
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,940
So we can't be teammates.

769
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,500
I can only be an opponent.

770
00:35:31,899 --> 00:35:33,220
Lu Xiao Bei, are you free?

771
00:35:33,379 --> 00:35:35,540
It's not the time to talk about brotherhood.

772
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,220
You know what?

773
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,180
If we lose to Langya again,

774
00:35:39,659 --> 00:35:41,500
There's no hope at all.

775
00:35:41,899 --> 00:35:42,899
Of course I know.

776
00:35:44,819 --> 00:35:46,700
That's why you should work hard.

777
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,099
Don't you think so?

778
00:35:51,099 --> 00:35:52,500
Everyone is busy training.

779
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,940
And you want to escape.

780
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:55,780
I'm telling you,

781
00:35:56,819 --> 00:35:57,500
No way.

782
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,419
That's enough.

783
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,740
Hurry up and train.

784
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,619
Xiaobei

785
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:25,540
I love you

786
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,740
I love you

787
00:36:32,139 --> 00:36:33,300
I've called the money.

788
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,140
We already have the cultivators in Ning Jiang Team.

789
00:36:44,379 --> 00:36:45,100
Why are you still

790
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,260
To the Langya League.

791
00:36:46,819 --> 00:36:48,740
Every chess piece has its own use.

792
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,300
I don't quite understand what you mean.

793
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,580
The Langya League has great potential.

794
00:36:56,019 --> 00:36:57,580
I hope they can be with the Striders

795
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,140
To the semi-professional league.

796
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,499
In the future,

797
00:37:00,499 --> 00:37:01,580
Crossfire Professional League

798
00:37:03,419 --> 00:37:04,459
According to you,

799
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,220
Then,

800
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,499
It's left to right.

801
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,499
Who do I want to win?

802
00:37:09,499 --> 00:37:10,419
Whoever wins,

803
00:37:11,379 --> 00:37:13,339
I have the final say on the outside.

804
00:37:15,419 --> 00:37:16,300
therefore

805
00:37:16,499 --> 00:37:18,339
You must sign zero to Langya.

806
00:37:25,459 --> 00:37:25,899
0 degree

807
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,339
Of course we know what you are capable of.

808
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,979
And hope to cooperate with you.

809
00:37:29,979 --> 00:37:31,260
But you know the truth.

810
00:37:31,979 --> 00:37:33,819
Can only be used as a substitute.

811
00:37:33,899 --> 00:37:34,660
Sign you.

812
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,060
I've been fighting at zero for so many years, crossing the fire line.

813
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,499
I've never been a substitute.

814
00:37:40,939 --> 00:37:42,060
It's just a title.

815
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,780
I will definitely satisfy you in terms of treatment.

816
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,539
We can combine forces.

817
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,419
The most important thing is to get out of Hundred Cities.

818
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:50,700
sorry

819
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,060
I only accept the main force.

820
00:37:52,339 --> 00:37:53,660
Otherwise, it's off.

821
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,339
Way

822
00:37:54,819 --> 00:37:55,899
Think about it.

823
00:38:00,459 --> 00:38:00,979
feed

824
00:38:03,899 --> 00:38:04,740
We're talking about

825
00:38:10,979 --> 00:38:11,740
good

826
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:20,220
Just sign it as you said.
