1
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:52,658
It's not too hot to cover it so tightly.

2
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,310
It's broken.

3
00:02:58,589 --> 00:02:59,110
No

4
00:02:59,749 --> 00:03:00,270
How did you do that?

5
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:04,510
What do you think?

6
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,709
You're the big sister.

7
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:06,350
It's all your fault.

8
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,470
Invite a wolf into the house ---- open the door to a dangerous foe

9
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,550
So I scratched the skin.

10
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,990
She has shown mercy.

11
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,109
There are only a few wolves in a team.

12
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:16,029
How to win the competition in the future.

13
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:16,990
Bear it.

14
00:03:17,749 --> 00:03:18,709
Xiaobei

15
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:20,230
Can you feel sorry for me first?

16
00:03:21,029 --> 00:03:22,230
Thinking about winning the championship.

17
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:22,870
Dream on.

18
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,069
You don't even have enough people now.

19
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,149
What do you mean?

20
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:27,149
They all ran away.

21
00:03:27,149 --> 00:03:28,910
I really can't stand the lady you invited.

22
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,509
I'm serious.

23
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,910
If it weren't for you, I would have run away.

24
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:32,190
You're so amazing.

25
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,950
I've asked one person to leave.

26
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:35,670
Great.

27
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:37,389
We can't get together.

28
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:38,389
Let's go.

29
00:03:38,749 --> 00:03:40,550
Those people will be replacements.

30
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:42,669
Wait

31
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,869
There must be five people to sign up for the Hundred Player League.

32
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:46,750
Can you beat a machine with one hand?

33
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:47,390
good

34
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,270
Even if you can,

35
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,350
Will the committee let you go?

36
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,470
So you should go back with me.

37
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,470
Get rid of her.

38
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:53,030
I'll invite the brothers back.

39
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:54,350
There are only a few days left.

40
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,709
Wait a second.

41
00:03:56,589 --> 00:03:57,309
ChengHao

42
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,869
Do you have to keep her?

43
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:05,149
If you want to make it,

44
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:06,750
She must stay.

45
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,429
a row

46
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,470
Save

47
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,470
To prove my brother.

48
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:17,470
It was bleeding to interpret your dream.

49
00:04:19,429 --> 00:04:20,190
Lu Xiao Bei,

50
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,350
I wish you happiness.

51
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,669
Lu Xiao Bei, you've changed.

52
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:36,229
You didn't ask me to stay.

53
00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:37,589
Why don't you play your cards according to the pattern?

54
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:49,470
good

55
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:52,350
You are the only one

56
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,590
That's enough.

57
00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:00,190
With the time and energy,

58
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,190
Get down to business.

59
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:05,190
Brother, I want to be serious.

60
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,829
But now, the registration deadline for Hundred Cities is closed.

61
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:08,229
There are only 20 days left.

62
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:09,989
We really can't find him.

63
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,509
What should we do?

64
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:12,190
I'll listen to you.

65
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,310
Ning Jiang is so big.

66
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,150
There are always one or two lone wolves.

67
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,310
One or two of them want to transfer.

68
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:20,910
To contact them.

69
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,669
This is the grade 1 exam paper.

70
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:25,829
It doesn't mean anything.

71
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:27,470
If you can pass the exam,

72
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,989
Why not now?

73
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:31,710
Your brother used to play games.

74
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,710
But he has always been a top student.

75
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,829
Nothing has been delayed.

76
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:35,949
You're so smart.

77
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,509
I don't ask you to enter a key university.

78
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:40,989
But at least I'll get a Bachelor Degree.

79
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:42,630
You think too highly of me.

80
00:05:42,989 --> 00:05:44,710
Even if I go to the first level,

81
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,310
I have to find a job after graduation.

82
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:48,829
Which company do you think

83
00:05:49,109 --> 00:05:50,750
Would accept a cripple like me.

84
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,910
What if you fail to play the game?

85
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,829
What if you can't be a professional player?

86
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:58,910
That's impossible.

87
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,829
I will definitely become a professional player.

88
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,430
You can play games.

89
00:06:03,109 --> 00:06:04,269
But I have a condition.

90
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,870
In your game world,

91
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:08,190
You can display your talent.

92
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,590
But in my game world,

93
00:06:10,989 --> 00:06:12,829
Please be a good player.

94
00:06:13,989 --> 00:06:15,030
Are you trying to trick me?

95
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:16,789
Do you accept it?

96
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:19,789
I have one condition.

97
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:20,949
You know,

98
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,069
Get me another desk mate.

99
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,949
With that person,

100
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:26,109
I really can't study.

101
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,669
Presentation

102
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,310
"please come in"

103
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,430
Miss Bai.

104
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,470
Can you change my deskmate?

105
00:06:43,109 --> 00:06:44,430
Do you two have any conflicts?

106
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,750
No

107
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:46,989
Then why change seats?

108
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:48,310
You have different habits.

109
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,109
Are not common people.

110
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,389
I can change your seats.

111
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:51,229
But not now.

112
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,470
The class is organizing a support group.

113
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,910
Starting with you two.

114
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:55,830
Xiaobei

115
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,629
You are responsible for helping Chu Ge study.

116
00:06:57,629 --> 00:06:58,869
To improve her academic performance.

117
00:06:58,869 --> 00:06:59,710
I'm not working with him.

118
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:00,390
teacher

119
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:02,710
You ask the last but one to teach the last to the last.

120
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,270
When it's fixed,

121
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,629
We are tied for the second last.

122
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:06,229
That's tied for the bottom.

123
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:07,789
This brain

124
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:09,950
Don't look down on others.

125
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,109
And look down on yourself.

126
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,150
You two have great potential.

127
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,070
I believe you can do better.

128
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:16,669
Chu song

129
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,350
Xiao Bei has bad legs.

130
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,590
I need to do some rehabilitation training.

131
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,869
To prevent the muscles from wasting.

132
00:07:20,869 --> 00:07:22,229
You're an expert on this.

133
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:23,189
From now on,

134
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,869
Help him after class.

135
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,270
I repeat.

136
00:07:26,429 --> 00:07:28,830
You should learn from each other.

137
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,510
Help each other and make progress.

138
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,910
I'm good at training. With his body,

139
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,390
I'm afraid it's useless for him.

140
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:35,830
Did you hear that?

141
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,989
We can't get along.

142
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:38,989
Change seats directly.

143
00:07:38,989 --> 00:07:40,350
Get her a good classmate.

144
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,669
I'm warning you.

145
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:43,910
With the way you two are acting,

146
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,629
The Dean's eyes are on you.

147
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:46,869
Think about it yourself.

148
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:51,030
Don't worry.

149
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,830
We must be united and friendly.

150
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:53,789
And progress together.

151
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:00,869
Lu Xiao Bei,

152
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,869
what are you doing?

153
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:04,830
Let's talk.

154
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:16,510
Are you helping each other?

155
00:08:16,989 --> 00:08:18,510
That's right. Hurry up.

156
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:47,030
If you don't study,

157
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:48,989
You told me it was dark this morning.

158
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,710
Is your leg broken?

159
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,150
You can't see other people's good legs.

160
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,350
Whatever you want.

161
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:57,270
Whatever I want.

162
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,710
You threw my shoes at me the day before yesterday.

163
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,030
You're really lame.

164
00:09:00,229 --> 00:09:01,150
If I don't teach you a lesson,

165
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,470
You still have to fool people.

166
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,629
Chuge, calm down.

167
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:04,950
If you push me into trouble,

168
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,830
You're the unlucky one.

169
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,510
It's none of my business that you fell.

170
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,030
Look for yourself.

171
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,830
Think it through.

172
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,030
If I keep shouting,

173
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,030
You'll be dropped out of school.

174
00:09:30,229 --> 00:09:31,390
Okay, you wait.

175
00:09:31,749 --> 00:09:32,989
I promise to train well.

176
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,189
You will never forget it.

177
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,910
Learn from Lei Feng and do good deeds.

178
00:09:58,109 --> 00:09:59,150
So that the students with inconvenient legs

179
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,030
Can you go home after school?

180
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,830
Do something nice.

181
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,989
Can't you do the questions?

182
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,549
Which question?

183
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:14,910
All of them.

184
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,030
It's all finished. Copy it.

185
00:10:23,109 --> 00:10:24,669
Exponent operation

186
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:25,549
I can't read it.

187
00:10:25,869 --> 00:10:26,669
Don't understand it.

188
00:10:27,309 --> 00:10:28,229
You can see clearly.

189
00:10:31,789 --> 00:10:33,070
You're doing this for me.

190
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,510
I'm ready to help you.

191
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:51,030
They drink protein powder and nitrogen pump.

192
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,749
That's great.

193
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:52,989
Drink sugar water.

194
00:10:59,989 --> 00:11:01,749
Can you stand up?

195
00:11:10,229 --> 00:11:10,950
I've checked.

196
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,909
You're neurotic lower limb paralysis.

197
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:15,190
Actually, the bones have long been formed.

198
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,989
Because of the lack of exercise.

199
00:11:16,989 --> 00:11:18,109
Caused by the disease.

200
00:11:18,109 --> 00:11:18,710
Neurodegeneration

201
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,470
Don't push the wheelchair away.

202
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:23,950
Push it back.

203
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:26,950
hurry up

204
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:28,229
I'm not joking with you.

205
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,590
I know what's wrong with me.

206
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:41,989
Come on.

207
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,590
For a while

208
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,830
I will force you to resist.

209
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,590
The method of multi-angle isometric contraction

210
00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:52,310
Exercise your quadriceps and hamstrings.

211
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:53,470
And the calf muscle.

212
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,509
And lower limb muscles.

213
00:11:56,869 --> 00:11:58,269
It's just the rehabilitation.

214
00:11:58,269 --> 00:11:58,790
Come on.

215
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,149
What are you doing?

216
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:02,269
You want to break my leg?

217
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:03,509
How could you practice like this?

218
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:04,869
You have to practice like this here.

219
00:12:06,749 --> 00:12:07,389
I'm protesting.

220
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:08,710
Are you trying to make me useless?

221
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,909
The protest is null and void.

222
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:12,869
If you want to stand up, you have to practice like this.

223
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:14,989
They hurt

224
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:15,909
They hurt

225
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,070
Wait a second, Chu Ge.

226
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,909
You should train step by step.

227
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:23,749
I've been paralyzed for ten years.

228
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:25,229
I've never practiced like this before.

229
00:12:25,229 --> 00:12:26,190
If I can't get out of bed tomorrow,

230
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:26,950
How can I go to school?

231
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:28,550
Why are you talking so much nonsense?

232
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:29,830
I'll use force.

233
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:30,710
Resist.

234
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:30,950
come

235
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,269
No way

236
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,509
Your power

237
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:46,190
I can't resist it.

238
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,590
We just finished this.

239
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,710
In the Super Cup semi-finals,

240
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,869
The cooperation between the teammates of Gravity.

241
00:12:53,869 --> 00:12:54,509
It's very powerful.

242
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,989
The Gravity Team has completely defeated the opponent.

243
00:12:56,989 --> 00:12:58,710
To the final of the Super Bowl.

244
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,830
The rookie King who just joined the team this year.

245
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,070
And become the best player again.

246
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,430
The point is, he's just 19.

247
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,629
Where is his upper limit?

248
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:08,710
Is an unknown number.

249
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,670
All we know is that

250
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:11,109
Fight like this.

251
00:13:11,109 --> 00:13:13,350
He will be the next King of the Golden Spear.

252
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,710
A strong competitor.

253
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:54,909
You're looking for death.

254
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:55,430
Come down.

255
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,389
It's none of your business for me to stay here.

256
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:00,070
Where are you blowing? No, you can't blow here.

257
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,550
Look at your figure.

258
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,149
The wind will blow you down.

259
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:04,070
The police are giving me trouble.

260
00:14:09,989 --> 00:14:11,350
Stop hiding.

261
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,869
Your eyes are swollen from crying.

262
00:14:14,109 --> 00:14:14,710
Nothing

263
00:14:15,109 --> 00:14:16,389
Your glasses can stop it.

264
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,229
I can't see.

265
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,629
I won't ask you more.

266
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:19,509
If you want to cry,

267
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:20,470
Just go inside and cry.

268
00:14:20,869 --> 00:14:21,989
I'll play games with headphones.

269
00:14:21,989 --> 00:14:22,509
not be able to hear

270
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,830
Your time is precious.

271
00:14:26,989 --> 00:14:28,710
You can't spend more time reading.

272
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,830
Research, your postgraduate recommendation.

273
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:39,269
Did you fail to get the postgraduate recommendation?

274
00:14:41,229 --> 00:14:42,350
They did it on purpose.

275
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:45,790
They secretly lobbied for my postgraduate qualification.

276
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,830
You can also get votes.

277
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,269
I'm a postgraduate student.

278
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:50,389
I won't do anything crooked.

279
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,509
How can it be called evil?

280
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,350
Get along well with the people around you.

281
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,710
It's called EQ.

282
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,029
Is also called a power.

283
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,109
What are you talking about?

284
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:01,950
I can't live in your dorm.

285
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:02,830
You have to move here?

286
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,710
What does that mean?

287
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:06,149
It means you have a bad relationship with your roommate.

288
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:08,269
You can't get along with only a few people.

289
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:09,389
How can you be a member of society?

290
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,670
Have you ever thought about

291
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,029
To find a job to support myself.

292
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:21,149
I'm telling you,

293
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:22,790
The game has its rules.

294
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:25,029
Society has its own rules.

295
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:27,029
Everyone plays a different role.

296
00:15:27,229 --> 00:15:28,029
Look at me.

297
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,749
What am I acting now?

298
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:30,989
Is a good son of his parents.

299
00:15:30,989 --> 00:15:32,350
A good employee of the company.

300
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,310
I'm good at acting.

301
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,710
Let me give you another piece of advice.

302
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:42,149
If you don't want to live your life,

303
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,269
The more narrow,

304
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,790
You took advantage of your youth

305
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,830
Change your nerd personality.

306
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,190
To find more ways out.

307
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,869
If you fail in the exam,

308
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,389
You have a way out.

309
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:52,590
You won't be eating for a lifetime.

310
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:53,869
There's no chance.

311
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,229
An Lan can't fail the exam.

312
00:15:55,229 --> 00:15:55,749
yes

313
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,550
You can only do well.

314
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,109
All the way to graduation.

315
00:15:59,109 --> 00:16:01,190
You must be over 30 by then.

316
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,389
What did your parents do?

317
00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:08,830
I'll be in your hole forever.

318
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:11,550
It's not a feudal society anymore.

319
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:14,710
I'm responsible for my own life.

320
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:16,509
You don't need anyone else's help.

321
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:20,229
Can I have a glass of water?

322
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:25,950
Do you really think

323
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,950
Don't you have to be responsible for your parents' future?

324
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,269
Your life

325
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:33,989
It took them a lifetime to make it.

326
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:38,229
I'm telling you,

327
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,269
When people are young,

328
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:42,590
You think you can change the world.

329
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,950
In a few years,

330
00:16:44,229 --> 00:16:45,869
You only found that you can only change yourself.

331
00:16:45,869 --> 00:16:46,950
To accommodate the world.

332
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:50,509
Otherwise, you'll be waiting to be knocked to the head.

333
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,509
As long as it's something I want to do,

334
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:53,790
Even if I hit my head badly,

335
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,830
I won't give up.

336
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,470
I used to be exactly the same as you.

337
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,430
Then look.

338
00:17:00,109 --> 00:17:01,269
Did I get any good results?

339
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,670
I'm telling you, just accept the reality.

340
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,269
Young children talk about dreams.

341
00:17:05,749 --> 00:17:07,509
Adults talk about survival.

342
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:08,989
That's your choice.

343
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,869
I don't want to live to please others.

344
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,149
Okay, you can choose whatever you want.

345
00:17:16,149 --> 00:17:17,350
Can we go inside first?

346
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:28,950
How to do it?

347
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,229
This is the reality.

348
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,989
A door will trap you.

349
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,749
What should we do now?

350
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:41,830
Waiting

351
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,109
Follow me.

352
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,430
Look in the mirror.

353
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,509
Take a look at yourself.

354
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:49,190
This is yellow hair.

355
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,550
You're always making trouble.

356
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,310
In my home,

357
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,389
You ruined the atmosphere of my family.

358
00:17:52,389 --> 00:17:53,070
You know what?

359
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,590
Get down here, Cheng Hao.

360
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,229
I'm coming down. What's wrong?

361
00:17:55,229 --> 00:17:55,869
Say it again.

362
00:17:55,869 --> 00:17:56,670
What's wrong?

363
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,029
Go away.

364
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:00,550
It's not my fault.

365
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,310
I didn't move.

366
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,229
You struggled on your own.

367
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,149
Su Jiayi.

368
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:04,269
You're too scheming.

369
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:09,830
Look at you.

370
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,109
You threw the others away.

371
00:18:11,109 --> 00:18:12,350
So that I can enjoy myself here.

372
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,989
You have the ability.

373
00:18:12,989 --> 00:18:13,830
You should fight with me.

374
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,190
Come and fight with me.

375
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,950
to occupy a latrine but not shit

376
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:18,950
You're not stupid.

377
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,749
And you know it's a latrine pit.

378
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,509
You two louder.

379
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:24,590
The police will be called next door.

380
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:26,710
Where is she?

381
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:28,310
They are all gone.

382
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,749
He just wanted to practice his gun.

383
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,109
It's good for her.

384
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:32,550
That mouth hasn't stopped.

385
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,830
She can't bear to leave.

386
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,749
I'm telling you, Xiao Bei,

387
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,950
Those who pretend to be the number,

388
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,470
It's not enough to be a sparring partner.

389
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,470
I beg you.

390
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,830
Aunt, don't be so rude.

391
00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:45,950
After a few days,

392
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,749
A thousand people.

393
00:18:47,989 --> 00:18:50,590
How about a few blocks?

394
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,710
You sell your teammates.

395
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,830
Who stepped on the corpses of his teammates to steal their heads.

396
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:57,470
I won't be in the battle.

397
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,710
To give their backs.

398
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,149
Don't follow me every day.

399
00:19:00,149 --> 00:19:01,149
Don't play tricks.

400
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,790
Can you fight with me?

401
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,989
I beg you to torture me.

402
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:05,070
Can you give me a fight?

403
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,790
I told you.

404
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,590
You don't deserve to play with Xiao Tu.

405
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,190
Xiaobei

406
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,350
You're right.

407
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,509
To be fair,

408
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:16,229
If you can't stand a few sarcastic comments,

409
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,350
There must be something wrong with their mentality.

410
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,430
The mental quality is very important.

411
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:23,350
Xiao Bei,

412
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:24,710
pretty

413
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:26,149
Hello.

414
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,350
a row

415
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,149
This is not good.

416
00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:29,190
That won't work.

417
00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:31,029
You're in a wheelchair, but your back doesn't ache.

418
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:32,749
I risked being beaten.

419
00:19:32,749 --> 00:19:33,670
Invite them here.

420
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,590
You didn't even look at it.

421
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,350
So he ran away.

422
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,190
Anyway, people who focus on professional league,

423
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,229
It's you, not me.

424
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:38,830
Now?

425
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,190
Hundred Cities will go to war in less than a month.

426
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,189
Who are you looking for?

427
00:19:42,189 --> 00:19:43,830
I'm doing my best.

428
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,709
There's a ready-made one.

429
00:19:46,949 --> 00:19:47,469
who

430
00:19:48,389 --> 00:19:48,949
WangKai

431
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:50,149
Are you crazy?

432
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,949
Who is Wang Kai? Is he amazing?

433
00:19:52,949 --> 00:19:53,790
eldest brother

434
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,469
Don't touch him, okay?

435
00:19:55,469 --> 00:19:56,510
Do you know that narrow-minded?

436
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,709
And stay in the internet café all night.

437
00:19:58,709 --> 00:20:00,270
Your eyes are like eating people.

438
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,350
Waiting to destroy you.

439
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:04,669
very good

440
00:20:05,629 --> 00:20:06,709
I was afraid that he would forget me.

441
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:08,550
I am looking forward to it

442
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:26,270
This is the beginning.

443
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,350
Nonsense, if Lu Xiao Bei

444
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,109
It's already started.

445
00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:38,629
I'll get it at point A.

446
00:20:38,629 --> 00:20:39,709
Are you going to stop me?

447
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,550
come out

448
00:21:05,469 --> 00:21:06,350
Stop me.

449
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,310
Go.

450
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,469
Why aren't you going?

451
00:21:08,469 --> 00:21:09,510
It's too strong.

452
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,990
How about you lure me to kill him?

453
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,030
Why didn't you lure me to kill him?

454
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,270
Then I won't go.

455
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,189
We won't go there.

456
00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:31,790
I'm going to install the bag.

457
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,869
No one will stop me?

458
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,869
Kaige Lu and Xiao Bei didn't do that.

459
00:21:57,389 --> 00:21:57,750
Brother Kai.

460
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,750
The more you practice, the worse you will be.

461
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,709
Let's practice more.

462
00:22:02,709 --> 00:22:04,109
I'm sure you can practice for three to five months.

463
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:04,990
That's right.

464
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:06,669
Come on.

465
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:11,149
Brother Kai.

466
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,109
Lu Xiao Bei,

467
00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:16,189
Why are you here?

468
00:22:16,189 --> 00:22:18,149
I heard that you have been

469
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:19,270
Has been acting me.

470
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,510
So we can return the favor.

471
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,389
I will play you once.

472
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,510
What do you want to do?

473
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:23,909
Kick the building.

474
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:27,669
Go ahead.

475
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:28,869
How?

476
00:22:31,189 --> 00:22:31,709
to pick

477
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,350
How dare you?

478
00:22:34,109 --> 00:22:34,629
To destroy you.

479
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,990
I'll fight with you later.

480
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,070
I

481
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,869
He will lose ugly.

482
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:50,510
I just want him to lose badly.

483
00:23:16,389 --> 00:23:18,949
Lu Xiao Bei, aren't you one-on-one?

484
00:23:18,949 --> 00:23:20,230
Don't hide.

485
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:40,790
meow

486
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,109
meow

487
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,389
meow

488
00:25:07,949 --> 00:25:08,590
Screw me.

489
00:25:09,189 --> 00:25:11,270
Lu Xiao Bei,

490
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,070
Wang Kai, right?

491
00:25:29,869 --> 00:25:30,429
to be a sore loser

492
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:32,149
Change the picture.

493
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:33,590
I will destroy you on behalf of the moon.

494
00:25:38,189 --> 00:25:41,429
It's embarrassing to be tortured by a girl.

495
00:25:41,629 --> 00:25:42,669
If I were you,

496
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:43,869
I'll be killed.

497
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,230
It's a crime to hurt a disabled person.

498
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:47,990
You did it on purpose.

499
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:52,149
You can't kill a chicken with a knife.

500
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,389
If you can't defeat Su Jiayi, you won't be able to defeat me.

501
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:55,830
Go back and practice.

502
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,270
You are always welcome to revenge.

503
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,030
But if you lose again,

504
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,389
I'll give you all the trophies.

505
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,949
I don't want those crap things.

506
00:26:04,669 --> 00:26:05,310
I want you.

507
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,270
Neuropathy

508
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,669
Don't go, Wang Kai.

509
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,469
If you lose again, come to my team.

510
00:26:13,469 --> 00:26:14,550
I'll help you with the foundation.

511
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,869
Admit it. You've fallen in love.

512
00:26:17,389 --> 00:26:18,909
I'm waiting for you, Wang Kai.

513
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:21,070
Lu Xiao Bei,

514
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,830
I can't figure it out.

515
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,629
What do you see in this guy?

516
00:26:25,869 --> 00:26:28,189
He has a fierce look in his eyes.

517
00:26:28,189 --> 00:26:29,629
He wants to win too much.

518
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,109
It's like a shark sees blood.

519
00:26:31,869 --> 00:26:33,590
I think he has a lot of room to grow.

520
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,510
A team with great energy.

521
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,070
We need a ruthless character like him.

522
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,909
I can be ruthless.

523
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:44,990
role

524
00:26:46,469 --> 00:26:47,830
You're quite ruthless when you fart.

525
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,230
Is the taste so strong?

526
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,669
It's so embarrassing. Leave.

527
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,230
I'm not going to work in a state-owned enterprise.

528
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,389
I don't go on blind dates.

529
00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:15,709
I want to take the postgraduate exam.

530
00:27:15,709 --> 00:27:17,109
Don't threaten me with money.

531
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:18,230
You don't have to pay the living expenses.

532
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,949
I can support myself by doing odd jobs.

533
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:20,869
feed

534
00:27:21,629 --> 00:27:22,030
feed

535
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,629
I just came home.

536
00:27:30,629 --> 00:27:31,629
Did you eat?

537
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,030
Give it to me.

538
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,750
what

539
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,109
Give it to me.

540
00:27:36,109 --> 00:27:36,510
Nothing

541
00:27:37,149 --> 00:27:38,310
I can help you.

542
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,990
Don't worry, I won't be short of you.

543
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,669
I'm from Ning Jiang University.

544
00:27:56,669 --> 00:27:58,070
I'm from the chemistry department. Where are you from?

545
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,830
Civil Engineering Department.

546
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,109
Yes

547
00:28:01,109 --> 00:28:02,230
I'm you. It's okay.

548
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:04,709
Yes

549
00:28:09,149 --> 00:28:10,790
I can teach you.

550
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,350
Did you hire a tutor?

551
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,990
I'm from the Culture Department of Ningjiang University.

552
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,869
Do you need a tutor?

553
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:17,550
You can have a look at my CET 4.

554
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,310
Do you need a tutor?

555
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:33,030
Uncle, do you need a tutor?

556
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:35,070
What can you teach me?

557
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,590
Out of the language,

558
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,510
I can teach you anything.

559
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,030
You can teach anything.

560
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,590
Twenty-two years old, Ning Jiang's local.

561
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:44,310
Are you studying in East China University of Finance and Economics?

562
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:47,230
I'm a statistics major from East China University of Finance and Economics.

563
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,350
It's so close to here.

564
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,109
Uncle, what grade is your child in?

565
00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:50,830
You're a senior this year.

566
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:53,550
There are still eight or nine months to go before the college entrance examination.

567
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,350
We need to work harder. It's time.

568
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,429
What are you doing?

569
00:28:56,429 --> 00:28:57,669
I'm just looking for someone.

570
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:58,550
To do my son's homework.

571
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,830
Do your homework.

572
00:29:00,109 --> 00:29:01,109
You know what?

573
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,590
My son is learning business from me.

574
00:29:03,949 --> 00:29:05,189
He didn't have time to do his homework.

575
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,590
The teacher asked me to go to school every day.

576
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,590
Won't it take some time?

577
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,550
I was...

578
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,590
I didn't expect him to go to college.

579
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,629
Can be stable.

580
00:29:11,629 --> 00:29:12,830
A high school diploma is enough.

581
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,510
Actually,

582
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:17,070
There is a wider world in the university.

583
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,590
He might be able to

584
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,149
To find something he likes more.

585
00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:21,550
What vast world?

586
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,590
I've told my son

587
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,350
This university

588
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,149
It's useless if you can't get it.

589
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:25,550
If you can't find a job,

590
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,790
I have to be like you.

591
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,590
To be a tutor.

592
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,109
No

593
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:31,149
Uncle, how can you teach your child like this?

594
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,590
How I teach is my business.

595
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,109
80 yuan for a day of homework.

596
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:34,790
What are you doing?

597
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,790
I'm here to be a tutor.

598
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,109
I'm not doing homework for others.

599
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:38,830
Uncle, I can.

600
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,149
I'm a graduate of Ningjiang University.

601
00:29:40,189 --> 00:29:41,070
I can.

602
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,030
I can write it for you for 50 yuan.

603
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,909
forty

604
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:45,429
It's you.

605
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:50,990
Are you going tomorrow?

606
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,350
go

607
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,149
I don't believe I can't get a job.

608
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:57,510
It's not that you can't find a job.

609
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,030
Your job is not good enough for you.

610
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,350
The world is so big.

611
00:30:05,869 --> 00:30:08,030
But when you really have to face it,

612
00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:10,550
I realized there was no place for you.

613
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,830
There are plenty of places.

614
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,750
It depends on how you find it.

615
00:30:17,189 --> 00:30:18,669
Einstein discovered that

616
00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:20,030
Before South America,

617
00:30:20,469 --> 00:30:22,310
People think the other side of the sea is the sea.

618
00:30:24,109 --> 00:30:25,149
That's Columbus.

619
00:30:31,909 --> 00:30:32,550
It's all the same.

620
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,550
You can understand me anyway.

621
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:38,790
Xiao Feng.

622
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,830
Do you remember your first job?

623
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,389
My first job.

624
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:47,990
I don't remember.

625
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:50,310
Do you remember the first money you made?

626
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:52,750
The first money.

627
00:30:54,189 --> 00:30:55,629
When I was in junior high,

628
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:58,230
To help Uncle Li fight the landlord downstairs.

629
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,790
And won one afternoon in a row.

630
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,510
Uncle Li was so happy that he couldn't close his mouth.

631
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,469
We are 50-50.

632
00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:07,550
You still have the ability.

633
00:31:08,709 --> 00:31:10,109
The game is interlinked.

634
00:31:10,389 --> 00:31:12,109
You know what I mean?

635
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:12,869
It's called intelligence.

636
00:31:13,949 --> 00:31:16,189
Did you join any shooting team?

637
00:31:16,389 --> 00:31:17,230
Not a shooting team.

638
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,830
It's a game for the team.

639
00:31:19,949 --> 00:31:22,109
Like shooting in a video game.

640
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,109
You are indeed a perfect student.

641
00:31:24,709 --> 00:31:25,990
You can understand it.

642
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:28,990
Why don't you play now?

643
00:31:29,469 --> 00:31:30,429
What about your teammates?

644
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,070
Where are the teammates?

645
00:31:59,869 --> 00:32:01,590
It's 2 yuan per hour and 10 yuan per night.

646
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,149
To see you.

647
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:08,389
sit

648
00:32:21,629 --> 00:32:22,909
Your business is good.

649
00:32:23,469 --> 00:32:25,629
Don't you want to play the National Challenge?

650
00:32:25,869 --> 00:32:27,389
National Challenge.

651
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,909
These crooked melons and split dates.

652
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,750
How to play the National Challenge?

653
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:32,590
Look.

654
00:32:33,149 --> 00:32:34,070
The four eyes.

655
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,790
How many times have we beaten him and cried before?

656
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,429
Don't practice if you have no talent.

657
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,990
The marksmanship is fed by time.

658
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:43,550
There are so many people practicing here.

659
00:32:43,869 --> 00:32:45,389
As for marksmanship,

660
00:32:45,389 --> 00:32:47,230
All of them have less than you.

661
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,669
It's useless.

662
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,790
I've sealed the gun.

663
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:13,750
That

664
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,669
I shouldn't have fought with you last time.

665
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,590
sorry

666
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:27,669
That's enough.

667
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,230
It's not like we haven't fought before.

668
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,909
If we hadn't fought in the internet cafe,

669
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,590
Xu Wei, come here.

670
00:33:34,949 --> 00:33:36,189
Without our team today,

671
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,109
Right?

672
00:33:37,109 --> 00:33:37,629
Yes

673
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:38,830
come

674
00:33:39,429 --> 00:33:39,949
come

675
00:33:40,469 --> 00:33:41,429
I always have a problem.

676
00:33:41,709 --> 00:33:42,830
I'm really curious why

677
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,949
We've always called the Steel Coin Team.

678
00:33:44,949 --> 00:33:45,869
You're calling the team.

679
00:33:46,389 --> 00:33:47,510
Have you seen our team logo?

680
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:50,590
Does it say ONE on the team logo?

681
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,429
Is there only one number?

682
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,590
You don't call it Gangfen Team?

683
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,389
Why do you call them?

684
00:33:54,669 --> 00:33:55,189
I was wondering

685
00:33:55,189 --> 00:33:57,070
Why do you call it Gangfen Team?

686
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,389
If that makes sense,

687
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:05,949
And dared to skip school and play games.

688
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,830
You're not my father.

689
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:08,550
Who are you?

690
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,070
Son of a bitch, you stop.

691
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:11,949
Neuropathy

692
00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:18,429
Every day.

693
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,949
Are all trying to compete in the challenge.

694
00:34:21,149 --> 00:34:21,590
But you want to

695
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,909
There are so many eyes all over the country.

696
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,510
It's not that easy.

697
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,990
Why don't you do something young?

698
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:31,830
yes

699
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,189
What should I do?

700
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,629
Don't be like us.

701
00:34:36,189 --> 00:34:36,590
It was delayed.

702
00:34:38,189 --> 00:34:39,070
Where are they?

703
00:34:39,709 --> 00:34:40,270
What about

704
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:41,790
It's good.

705
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:42,949
Have found a job.

706
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,270
Xu Wei is still floating.

707
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:48,389
Every day, the Internet café

708
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,550
Don't mention Xu Wei.

709
00:34:50,109 --> 00:34:51,350
You're really powerful.

710
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,270
If you really rely on a strong team,

711
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:55,149
Maybe he can win the championship.

712
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,429
Come on.

713
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,149
With his marksmanship,

714
00:34:58,149 --> 00:34:59,510
If we hadn't cooperated well,

715
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,909
There's no chance for him to shoot.

716
00:35:00,909 --> 00:35:01,830
I'm telling you, the Steel Coin Team

717
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,030
Without Xu Wei, it's still the Steel Coin Team.

718
00:35:03,429 --> 00:35:04,869
If Xu Wei doesn't have the troops,

719
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,310
He's nothing. Believe it or not?

720
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:06,869
yes

721
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:07,550
Don't laugh.

722
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,070
I'm telling you,

723
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,070
That's enough.

724
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,669
Don't worry about it.

725
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,709
You have people in your office now.

726
00:35:12,709 --> 00:35:14,149
Don't worry about the game.

727
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:17,750
How have you been recently?

728
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:21,550
I'm making more money than you.

729
00:35:22,629 --> 00:35:23,230
a row

730
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:24,750
a row

731
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,949
The troops broke up once.

732
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:39,030
But they reorganized soon.

733
00:36:12,949 --> 00:36:15,070
Liar, are you there?

734
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,350
I'm here.

735
00:36:17,869 --> 00:36:18,230
Correct!

736
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,949
Did you receive the postcard I sent you?

737
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:22,669
What postcard?

738
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:24,909
There's a welcome sign from Beijing.

739
00:36:24,909 --> 00:36:26,389
There's also a picture of Fuwa's welcome.

740
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:29,310
I'm on August 25th, 2008.

741
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:29,830
Sent out.

742
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:30,949
I'm so big.

743
00:36:30,949 --> 00:36:32,389
Never received a postcard.

744
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,830
It's impossible. There must be.

745
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:34,750
Look for her.

746
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:36,070
I sent the registered mail.

747
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,270
You have received the receipt.

748
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:38,030
a row

749
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,149
Let me ask.

750
00:36:49,069 --> 00:36:49,630
feed

751
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,350
Hello, Xiao Bei.

752
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,469
Why are you still up so late?

753
00:36:51,469 --> 00:36:52,270
These days,

754
00:36:52,909 --> 00:36:55,150
Did you receive a postcard in your office?

755
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,589
What postcard?

756
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,909
No, go to bed.

757
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:01,949
feed

758
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,190
Did you find it?

759
00:37:03,509 --> 00:37:04,230
No

760
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,069
That's enough.

761
00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:06,989
Let's forget about the postcard.

762
00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:09,350
If you really

763
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,029
In 2009,

764
00:37:11,549 --> 00:37:12,469
There are eleven years between us.

765
00:37:12,469 --> 00:37:13,909
Why did you meet in the game?

766
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:16,310
Think about it.

767
00:37:16,989 --> 00:37:18,589
Your data and mine

768
00:37:18,589 --> 00:37:20,469
Are in the game's database.

769
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:21,630
Could it be that

770
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,110
What's wrong with the game?

771
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,750
And connected us through time and space.

772
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:26,710
It's Tai Xuan School.

773
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,230
Correct!

774
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,630
Are you armed?

775
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:31,710
Of course.

776
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,350
I think I can get through it.

777
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,150
I think I can get through here.

778
00:38:09,549 --> 00:38:10,589
So you were locked up there.

779
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,549
What's going on between us?

780
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:17,110
Is it stuck in the hole?

781
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:20,190
I have no idea

782
00:38:23,389 --> 00:38:24,270
It's weird.

783
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,429
Why is there no one here?

784
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,830
We chartered the boat.

785
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:32,270
feed

786
00:38:32,549 --> 00:38:33,750
Do you still think I'm a liar?

787
00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:35,589
I really don't believe that you're from 2008.

788
00:38:35,909 --> 00:38:36,670
It's too unscientific.

789
00:38:37,389 --> 00:38:37,949
Brothers!

790
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,270
You're good at shooting.

791
00:38:40,029 --> 00:38:41,270
Since we are all from Ningjiang,

792
00:38:41,509 --> 00:38:42,029
not as good as

793
00:38:42,509 --> 00:38:43,310
Come to my team.

794
00:38:43,469 --> 00:38:44,509
What's the configuration of your team?

795
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:45,670
I'm a sniper.

796
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,150
Your marksmanship is good.

797
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:48,630
There's a wanderer.

798
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,589
His marksmanship is not good.

799
00:38:49,589 --> 00:38:50,869
But he has a good sense of defense.

800
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,710
We have a female player.

801
00:38:53,549 --> 00:38:54,389
She's a good shot.

802
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,509
Can play any position.

803
00:38:56,989 --> 00:38:57,790
Your team

804
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,270
No one is good at breaking through.

805
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,589
Isn't it a target to hit?

806
00:39:02,029 --> 00:39:04,069
I've targeted a good breakout player.

807
00:39:04,549 --> 00:39:05,350
Good at shooting.

808
00:39:05,549 --> 00:39:06,310
Fight.

809
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,230
It's like a clockwork.

810
00:39:07,509 --> 00:39:08,549
What weapon did he use?

811
00:39:08,549 --> 00:39:09,270
And the M4.

812
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,150
And has a violent temper.

813
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,790
You should be bad-tempered.

814
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,110
A team must have such a ruthless character.

815
00:39:15,429 --> 00:39:16,069
first

816
00:39:16,589 --> 00:39:18,630
You have to take down the M4.

817
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,230
secondly

818
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,389
You need to find a really strong AK.

819
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,230
It's a tough AK.

820
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:25,429
Remember that.

821
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,790
AK is always the sharpest knife.

822
00:39:27,989 --> 00:39:29,589
But people who are good at playing AK

823
00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:30,710
Can't communicate well.

824
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:31,589
Brothers!

825
00:39:32,389 --> 00:39:32,989
Think about it.

826
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:34,469
Come to my team.

827
00:39:35,469 --> 00:39:37,029
My team has disbanded.

828
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,270
I'm not playing games now.

829
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,350
Working at work.

830
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:39,989
other

831
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:41,429
Aren't you Xiao Feng?

832
00:39:41,949 --> 00:39:42,869
Xiao Feng.

833
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:44,949
But the man who wants to win the championship and the King of Golden Spear

834
00:39:45,869 --> 00:39:46,350
you

835
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,029
So I gave up.

836
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,029
Don't be ridiculous.

837
00:39:54,029 --> 00:39:55,549
My current office is good.

838
00:39:56,069 --> 00:39:57,429
The leader also values me.

839
00:39:57,869 --> 00:39:58,949
And I'm free.

840
00:39:59,509 --> 00:40:00,310
The welfare is good.

841
00:40:01,389 --> 00:40:02,909
In a few days,

842
00:40:02,909 --> 00:40:03,710
And gave you moon cakes.

843
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,190
That's the end.

844
00:40:08,509 --> 00:40:09,350
Don't you feel sorry?

845
00:40:10,989 --> 00:40:12,549
God didn't give me any choice.

846
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,230
Hello, can you hear me?

847
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,469
It's two and a half minutes.
