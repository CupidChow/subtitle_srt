1
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,328
Ming's current symptoms

2
00:02:37,728 --> 00:02:41,169
Is a typical game addiction psychosis.

3
00:02:41,888 --> 00:02:42,969
But fortunately,

4
00:02:43,529 --> 00:02:44,768
You came to the right place.

5
00:02:45,088 --> 00:02:47,369
Early treatment and early rehabilitation.

6
00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:48,649
See the back.

7
00:02:48,649 --> 00:02:50,928
This is the medical result of our years.

8
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:53,408
As long as you cooperate with the treatment plan,

9
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,009
You can definitely get rid of your Internet addiction.

10
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,088
Return to normal life.

11
00:02:58,088 --> 00:03:00,009
And return to my parents.

12
00:03:00,929 --> 00:03:02,569
Leave the child to me.

13
00:03:03,088 --> 00:03:03,768
I promise.

14
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:06,249
Sent a boy with internet addiction.

15
00:03:06,249 --> 00:03:09,088
And give you a healthy son.

16
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:14,289
For two months.

17
00:03:14,488 --> 00:03:16,049
As long as I can help my son,

18
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:17,488
Get rid of Internet addiction.

19
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,649
Whatever you want.

20
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:20,569
How much is it worth?

21
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:24,249
To be clear,

22
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:27,448
Our treatment method may be extreme.

23
00:03:27,649 --> 00:03:29,089
But it's definitely effective.

24
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:31,488
Can you all accept it?

25
00:03:31,848 --> 00:03:33,049
As long as I can help the child,

26
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:34,368
I've completely broken my internet addiction.

27
00:03:34,368 --> 00:03:35,529
Any treatment.

28
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:36,969
We all accept it.

29
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:38,568
It's done.

30
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:44,449
to fix

31
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:46,169
What do you mean?

32
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:46,928
It's you.

33
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:52,768
what are you doing?

34
00:03:52,768 --> 00:03:54,169
Don't come to Ming.

35
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:56,049
You're always in an internet café.

36
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:56,809
You don't need to do anything serious.

37
00:03:56,809 --> 00:03:57,568
In my opinion,

38
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,609
Both of you are sick.

39
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:00,609
Will be cured.

40
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,848
Uncle, what's wrong with Ming?

41
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:03,689
Sick

42
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:04,809
What's wrong with you?

43
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:05,928
Terminally ill

44
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:11,768
Are you Ming's friends?

45
00:04:12,568 --> 00:04:13,969
Leave now.

46
00:04:14,249 --> 00:04:15,249
Be careful.

47
00:04:15,249 --> 00:04:17,488
To the internet addiction center.

48
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:18,768
It's not a place for people.

49
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:19,889
to go through sheer hell

50
00:04:20,128 --> 00:04:21,169
Without freedom,

51
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:22,329
Get out of here.

52
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:29,288
hidden

53
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:37,688
This is not an internet addiction center.

54
00:04:37,688 --> 00:04:38,808
Is illegal.

55
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:40,169
A group of crooks.

56
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:41,528
The news was exposed before.

57
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:43,729
The government has ordered them to close down for rectification.

58
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:45,049
But these people are crazy.

59
00:04:45,049 --> 00:04:46,449
I will do anything for money.

60
00:04:46,609 --> 00:04:47,889
And hired a security guard.

61
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:49,049
Besides the parents,

62
00:04:49,049 --> 00:04:49,729
No one is allowed to enter.

63
00:04:50,049 --> 00:04:51,648
The visual fence can be four meters high.

64
00:04:51,648 --> 00:04:53,049
It's covered with glass debris.

65
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:54,409
And the power grid.

66
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:56,889
We should ask the police to take down this illegal den.

67
00:04:56,889 --> 00:04:57,928
And harmed so many people.

68
00:04:57,928 --> 00:04:59,329
I heard that the treatment is expensive.

69
00:04:59,488 --> 00:05:01,049
My parents are so gullible.

70
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:03,609
Let's call the police.

71
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:05,049
You can't scare them.

72
00:05:05,049 --> 00:05:06,808
Let's stick to the plan.

73
00:05:06,808 --> 00:05:07,808
Find Ming first.

74
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:09,488
And investigate the details inside.

75
00:05:09,928 --> 00:05:11,289
There's a security guard of 3 meters.

76
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:12,609
Ten meters each.

77
00:05:12,609 --> 00:05:14,289
Every move is under their noses.

78
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:16,849
Why don't you apply for the security guard?

79
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:17,849
Find a way to get in.

80
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:19,688
Those aren't security guards.

81
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:20,968
There are parents outside.

82
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:22,528
There are all graduates here.

83
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,609
Was brainwashed by Professor Yang.

84
00:05:24,609 --> 00:05:25,889
Organized by myself.

85
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:27,368
And even their own trucks

86
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,768
The goods must be unloaded outside.

87
00:05:28,768 --> 00:05:30,248
We can't get in except the internal staff.

88
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:31,088
So what?

89
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:32,968
I have a way.

90
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:36,129
It's for your own good.

91
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:36,928
Behave yourself.

92
00:05:36,928 --> 00:05:38,129
I'm here to treat you.

93
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:38,688
I'm not sick.

94
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:40,329
Isn't it for your own good?

95
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:42,129
Professor Yang, I'm not sick.

96
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:42,968
What's up

97
00:05:47,049 --> 00:05:48,609
There's a new friend here.

98
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:50,768
Welcome

99
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:51,729
Professor Yang.

100
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:52,928
This is patient information.

101
00:05:53,488 --> 00:05:54,289
Let's have a look.

102
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:00,009
Xiao Feng.

103
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:06,129
How long does he spend in front of the computer?

104
00:06:07,609 --> 00:06:09,808
At least eight hours a day.

105
00:06:09,808 --> 00:06:12,129
Sometimes, I'll go round and round for 24 hours.

106
00:06:13,688 --> 00:06:15,449
More than six hours.

107
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,688
You can get addicted to the internet.

108
00:06:18,688 --> 00:06:20,329
He's already 23.

109
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:21,648
Don't you work?

110
00:06:22,368 --> 00:06:23,768
The game is his job.

111
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:26,968
Play games for work.

112
00:06:26,968 --> 00:06:28,528
What a fool!

113
00:06:28,808 --> 00:06:31,968
This is the expression of severe internet addiction.

114
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:35,248
Professor Yang, can it be cured?

115
00:06:39,088 --> 00:06:40,009
The swindler

116
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:41,328
Is only five meters away from me.

117
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:43,969
I can clearly see his ugly face.

118
00:06:44,248 --> 00:06:46,008
The thought of him using such a clumsy means

119
00:06:46,008 --> 00:06:47,328
You lied to so many innocent people.

120
00:06:47,609 --> 00:06:47,849
I just...

121
00:06:48,128 --> 00:06:50,688
I've been a doctor for 20 years.

122
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:53,128
There's nothing I can't cure.

123
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:55,928
Internet addict.

124
00:06:58,368 --> 00:06:59,609
We must get something on him.

125
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:01,849
Please go through the admission procedures.

126
00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:03,128
Pay the fee.

127
00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:04,289
How much should I pay?

128
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:07,049
Look at his symptoms.

129
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:08,769
At least three courses.

130
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:12,289
One treatment is 18,000 yuan.

131
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:15,529
Professor Yang, here's the thing.

132
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:16,729
Because we went out in a hurry.

133
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:17,928
He didn't bring any money with him.

134
00:07:17,928 --> 00:07:19,169
That's right.

135
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:20,248
For example, for a few days,

136
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:23,089
I can wait.

137
00:07:23,448 --> 00:07:26,888
But he can't wait any longer.

138
00:07:26,888 --> 00:07:28,688
We'll pay the deposit first.

139
00:07:28,688 --> 00:07:30,808
There are many patients admitted now.

140
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:33,368
We only accept full payment.

141
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:34,649
I can't.

142
00:07:38,248 --> 00:07:39,008
I'm not sick.

143
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:40,289
You're the one wearing glasses.

144
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:41,409
I went online.

145
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:42,688
I'm glad it's none of your business.

146
00:07:42,688 --> 00:07:43,888
This is my right.

147
00:07:43,888 --> 00:07:45,368
I've been using the Internet a lot. It's Internet addiction.

148
00:07:45,368 --> 00:07:46,769
Did you eat too much?

149
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:47,928
Is it food addiction?

150
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:49,488
You slept too much.

151
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:51,128
You're sleepy.

152
00:07:51,488 --> 00:07:52,328
See that?

153
00:07:52,609 --> 00:07:55,409
He has developed symptoms of schizophrenia.

154
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,609
So Professor Yang, please save him.

155
00:07:57,609 --> 00:07:58,209
Professor Yang.

156
00:07:58,209 --> 00:07:59,368
Just take him.

157
00:07:59,368 --> 00:08:00,609
We'll figure out a way about the money.

158
00:08:00,609 --> 00:08:01,289
Yes, Professor Yang.

159
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:02,248
We've seen so many places.

160
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,488
You're the only one who can cure it.

161
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:03,928
That's right.

162
00:08:03,928 --> 00:08:04,368
That's right.

163
00:08:04,368 --> 00:08:05,488
You're fooled.

164
00:08:05,488 --> 00:08:07,529
He is a swindler.

165
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,049
Under the banner of getting rid of Internet addiction,

166
00:08:09,049 --> 00:08:10,928
You're lying here.

167
00:08:10,928 --> 00:08:12,609
I want to play games.

168
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:13,529
Alright.

169
00:08:14,008 --> 00:08:15,128
Judging from his current situation,

170
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,688
Can't be delayed any longer.

171
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:18,128
We'll treat him first.

172
00:08:18,368 --> 00:08:19,409
Then hurry up.

173
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:20,169
Preparation cost

174
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:21,089
Thank you, Professor Yang.

175
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:25,568
sorry

176
00:08:26,888 --> 00:08:27,888
Catch him!

177
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:28,969
Catch him!

178
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:29,849
chase

179
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,128
Catch him!

180
00:08:37,248 --> 00:08:37,928
Catch him!

181
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:39,488
Catch him!

182
00:08:39,488 --> 00:08:40,368
Sorry

183
00:08:40,368 --> 00:08:41,049
Catch him!

184
00:08:41,808 --> 00:08:42,609
Catch him!

185
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:43,849
Don't run.

186
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:44,409
Catch him!

187
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:50,089
Open the door

188
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,328
You can't run away.

189
00:08:56,049 --> 00:08:57,448
Please leave.

190
00:08:58,808 --> 00:09:00,248
I haven't washed my hands yet.

191
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:00,928
What are you doing?

192
00:09:06,888 --> 00:09:07,368
Hurry up.

193
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:39,969
Can it be fixed?

194
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:42,169
I don't know. Try it.

195
00:09:42,488 --> 00:09:43,409
Buy a new one.

196
00:09:43,928 --> 00:09:44,729
This is great.

197
00:09:44,969 --> 00:09:46,769
As long as your son knows your feelings.

198
00:09:49,328 --> 00:09:50,488
You can throw it away if it's broken.

199
00:09:51,128 --> 00:09:52,128
His son is broken.

200
00:09:52,128 --> 00:09:53,008
You can throw it.

201
00:09:56,969 --> 00:09:57,649
My son is broken.

202
00:09:57,649 --> 00:09:58,969
Can't be thrown away.

203
00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:01,529
But if you break it, you can throw it away.

204
00:10:03,808 --> 00:10:05,488
Haven't you always opposed it?

205
00:10:05,729 --> 00:10:06,928
How did you change so fast?

206
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:08,609
Since the car accident,

207
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:09,969
I thought

208
00:10:10,328 --> 00:10:11,128
It's a game.

209
00:10:11,808 --> 00:10:12,808
Who took away Xiao Nan.

210
00:10:12,808 --> 00:10:15,529
So I tried my best to stop Xiao Bei from playing games.

211
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:18,248
I was afraid of losing another child.

212
00:10:19,248 --> 00:10:20,128
For so many years,

213
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:22,529
My father-son relationship is like this.

214
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:23,688
As you can see,

215
00:10:23,849 --> 00:10:25,248
I feel sad.

216
00:10:26,328 --> 00:10:27,568
I went to the internet café today.

217
00:10:27,568 --> 00:10:29,209
I saw Xiao Bei play the match.

218
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:31,448
He's so energetic.

219
00:10:32,448 --> 00:10:33,368
So confident.

220
00:10:33,568 --> 00:10:34,368
So happy.

221
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:35,609
to speak the truth

222
00:10:36,328 --> 00:10:37,008
Who is the father?

223
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:38,849
Don't you want to see your son happy?

224
00:11:15,568 --> 00:11:17,328
An iron pestle can be ground into an embroidery needle.

225
00:11:17,328 --> 00:11:18,208
She only has one piece of wood.

226
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,728
At most, it can be ground into a toothpick.

227
00:11:19,728 --> 00:11:21,129
Boss is not young anymore.

228
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:22,688
To get a job.

229
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,009
go went

230
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:53,489
good

231
00:11:53,968 --> 00:11:54,649
Everyone is ready.

232
00:11:57,568 --> 00:11:59,088
Take your positions.

233
00:11:59,088 --> 00:11:59,688
Get set

234
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:00,848
faster

235
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:02,169
run

236
00:12:02,169 --> 00:12:03,249
fastest

237
00:12:34,608 --> 00:12:36,489
The shoes sell so well.

238
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,769
It's almost out of stock.

239
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:39,009
Let's hold an event in our shop.

240
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,208
I can give you a 30 percent discount.

241
00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:55,129
How much is this?

242
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:56,088
368.

243
00:12:56,088 --> 00:12:56,889
No discount.

244
00:12:58,568 --> 00:12:59,328
Take this.

245
00:13:00,808 --> 00:13:01,489
Just training.

246
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,608
Have you seen Chu Ge?

247
00:13:02,928 --> 00:13:03,848
I didn't see it.

248
00:13:04,088 --> 00:13:06,169
Where can the cat recite the words?

249
00:13:06,728 --> 00:13:07,808
Have you heard?

250
00:13:08,049 --> 00:13:09,649
Chuge is in love.

251
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:10,649
What?

252
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,568
Everyone is talking about it.

253
00:13:12,728 --> 00:13:14,009
You don't know.

254
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:14,728
Who?

255
00:13:15,369 --> 00:13:16,529
Who else can it be?

256
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,049
The cripple in the wheelchair.

257
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:19,409
Lu Xiao Bei,

258
00:13:19,409 --> 00:13:21,328
How could Chu Ge and him

259
00:13:21,688 --> 00:13:23,728
People have different tastes.

260
00:13:23,728 --> 00:13:25,009
He has a unique taste.

261
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:27,728
They are inseparable all the time.

262
00:13:27,728 --> 00:13:29,009
It's like living a life.

263
00:13:31,688 --> 00:13:32,688
Are you so free?

264
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:34,009
I'm telling you,

265
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:35,169
I wouldn't like it at all.

266
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:36,489
A cripple in a wheelchair.

267
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:46,489
Remember,

268
00:13:47,249 --> 00:13:49,769
You are not patients here.

269
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:51,129
I'm not a doctor.

270
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:52,448
We are allies.

271
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:54,608
To fight Internet addiction together.

272
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:55,688
therefore

273
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,608
No matter what we did here,

274
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,608
What kind of way did you take?

275
00:13:59,928 --> 00:14:00,728
I want you

276
00:14:00,968 --> 00:14:01,928
To resist it.

277
00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:03,688
It doesn't matter if you're uncomfortable.

278
00:14:03,688 --> 00:14:05,088
This is not the purpose.

279
00:14:05,249 --> 00:14:07,129
We only have one purpose.

280
00:14:07,448 --> 00:14:08,728
Is to get rid of Internet addiction.

281
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:09,968
Reboot life.

282
00:14:09,968 --> 00:14:12,369
And build a better future together.

283
00:14:12,608 --> 00:14:14,049
Our slogan is

284
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:17,369
Get rid of Internet addiction and reinvent myself.

285
00:14:17,568 --> 00:14:18,369
good

286
00:14:19,448 --> 00:14:20,289
Clap your hands.

287
00:14:23,968 --> 00:14:26,249
The physical training starts now.

288
00:14:26,489 --> 00:14:27,688
Hands on your head.

289
00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:29,249
one

290
00:14:30,928 --> 00:14:31,649
two

291
00:14:32,848 --> 00:14:33,808
three

292
00:14:35,728 --> 00:14:36,568
four

293
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:38,728
five

294
00:14:39,928 --> 00:14:40,649
six

295
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:43,009
seven

296
00:14:43,728 --> 00:14:44,369
Al-Amin

297
00:14:44,848 --> 00:14:45,489
eight

298
00:14:47,448 --> 00:14:48,889
Why are you here?

299
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:51,009
ten

300
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:52,409
I'm here to get you out.

301
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:55,129
How to save him?

302
00:14:56,769 --> 00:14:57,049
twelve

303
00:14:57,049 --> 00:14:58,049
You came here.

304
00:14:59,808 --> 00:15:01,049
It's hard to die.

305
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:02,848
fourteen

306
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:03,769
Stay out of it.

307
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:05,409
fifteen

308
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:06,608
I have a way to get you out of here.

309
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,129
nineteen

310
00:15:10,568 --> 00:15:11,289
Someone fainted.

311
00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:31,728
feed

312
00:15:32,088 --> 00:15:33,088
How are you?

313
00:15:33,369 --> 00:15:34,208
Ming is by my side.

314
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:36,568
I'm fine.

315
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,448
How are you? Is it going well?

316
00:15:38,728 --> 00:15:39,728
smoothly

317
00:15:39,728 --> 00:15:41,129
We have figured out the escape route.

318
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:42,328
The equipment has been confirmed.

319
00:15:42,328 --> 00:15:43,249
The car was parked nearby.

320
00:15:43,448 --> 00:15:45,249
It's 5: 30 for the security shift.

321
00:15:45,249 --> 00:15:46,568
At that time, it was the lowest.

322
00:15:46,568 --> 00:15:47,328
We will act on time.

323
00:15:47,568 --> 00:15:48,769
Okay, according to the original plan,

324
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,568
Before 5: 30,

325
00:15:50,568 --> 00:15:51,489
To the appointed place.

326
00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:52,289
I'll wait for you.

327
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:53,129
OK

328
00:15:53,409 --> 00:15:54,409
Then be careful.

329
00:15:54,409 --> 00:15:55,009
Be careful.

330
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:56,489
Don't worry. Wait for my call.

331
00:15:58,129 --> 00:15:59,568
Can we really get out of here?

332
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:08,369
Cheng Hao B, the door is closed.

333
00:16:08,369 --> 00:16:09,129
Wang Kai, Su Jiayi,

334
00:16:09,328 --> 00:16:10,088
A door double frame.

335
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:11,688
Nezha, go to the alley with me.

336
00:16:11,688 --> 00:16:12,489
Throw a thunder and leave.

337
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:13,568
Not to them.

338
00:16:15,568 --> 00:16:16,088
That's amazing.

339
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:17,289
Boss, look.

340
00:16:17,289 --> 00:16:17,889
When King comes,

341
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:19,688
The Striders are totally different.

342
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:22,009
He came from gravity, right?

343
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:22,848
that's right

344
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,608
It's too easy to play a hundred cities at professional level.

345
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:28,289
They'll be in the top three if they win the next round.

346
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:29,928
Xiao Bei, where are they now?

347
00:16:30,409 --> 00:16:31,688
It's near the back. I'll look for it.

348
00:16:31,688 --> 00:16:33,249
Go on. The team is now ranked 17.

349
00:16:33,249 --> 00:16:34,529
Only the top two can qualify.

350
00:16:35,088 --> 00:16:36,169
I think they're hanging by a thread.

351
00:16:37,369 --> 00:16:38,448
Who will they fight next?

352
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:40,688
Qiaocheng Square Q plex

353
00:16:40,688 --> 00:16:41,889
This team is the 19th.

354
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:46,448
Nice shot, Xiao Bei.

355
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:50,409
cattle

356
00:16:50,848 --> 00:16:51,688
Xiaobeisixsixsix

357
00:16:52,728 --> 00:16:53,529
I told you not to shoot.

358
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:54,249
Didn't you hear that?

359
00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:54,649
Nezha, protection deity

360
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:55,608
Lu Xiao Bei,

361
00:16:55,608 --> 00:16:56,608
Are you serious?

362
00:16:56,608 --> 00:16:57,608
We've already won.

363
00:16:57,889 --> 00:16:58,608
And you.

364
00:16:58,848 --> 00:17:00,009
Who told you to go out through Gate A?

365
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:02,049
What's wrong?

366
00:17:02,049 --> 00:17:02,769
You're a hero, right?

367
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:04,009
Yes, he's a hero.

368
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:05,009
They are not our opponent.

369
00:17:05,009 --> 00:17:06,369
I'll give them a shot.

370
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:07,769
Are you the captain or am I the captain?

371
00:17:08,608 --> 00:17:09,529
I can't bear it.

372
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,889
Your stupid turtle tactics.

373
00:17:10,889 --> 00:17:11,489
Do you know

374
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:12,289
Let's play like this.

375
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:13,249
What's wrong?

376
00:17:14,129 --> 00:17:14,688
That's it.

377
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:16,129
Didn't we win the game?

378
00:17:16,129 --> 00:17:16,848
Stop it.

379
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:17,928
Let's eat.

380
00:17:17,928 --> 00:17:18,369
My treat.

381
00:17:18,848 --> 00:17:19,688
You won.

382
00:17:19,968 --> 00:17:21,489
But how can a cat kill a mouse?

383
00:17:21,968 --> 00:17:24,088
I said before the game that they were not strong enough.

384
00:17:24,088 --> 00:17:25,529
The purpose of this game is not to win.

385
00:17:25,688 --> 00:17:27,489
To practice and cooperate with tactics.

386
00:17:27,649 --> 00:17:28,649
We can rely on our personal ability.

387
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:29,688
And win the game.

388
00:17:29,968 --> 00:17:31,568
But what if you meet a strong team?

389
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:32,489
Yes

390
00:17:32,489 --> 00:17:34,568
Xiao Bei is right. We won't make a exception.

391
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:36,529
Calm down. Go and eat.

392
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:46,208
Don't be angry, Xiao Bei.

393
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,688
My myopia is 600 degrees.

394
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:54,208
Are playing games.

395
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:57,049
At that time, I wanted to skip school.

396
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:58,369
You won't eat.

397
00:17:59,928 --> 00:18:00,808
You're not sleeping.

398
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,409
To play games.

399
00:18:04,088 --> 00:18:04,848
but

400
00:18:06,448 --> 00:18:07,568
Since I came here,

401
00:18:07,848 --> 00:18:09,088
I didn't play games anymore.

402
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,848
I started eating on time every day.

403
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,049
Sleep on time.

404
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:13,808
My health is much better.

405
00:18:13,808 --> 00:18:15,049
I think my life

406
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:17,049
Are bright.

407
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:18,049
professor

408
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:19,208
Thank you.

409
00:18:26,328 --> 00:18:27,928
I'm more serious than him.

410
00:18:28,688 --> 00:18:31,369
I stole money from home to buy equipment online.

411
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:32,328
My mother advised me

412
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:33,608
I hit my mother.

413
00:18:33,608 --> 00:18:35,289
My dad had a heart attack.

414
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:36,769
Professor Yang saved me.

415
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:38,608
I'll never play games again.

416
00:18:38,608 --> 00:18:39,608
If I play games again,

417
00:18:39,608 --> 00:18:40,409
I will cut off my hands.

418
00:18:40,409 --> 00:18:46,208
I'm not playing games anymore.

419
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,369
So exaggerated.

420
00:18:48,968 --> 00:18:51,009
No speeches, no meals.

421
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:51,848
Goodboy

422
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:53,608
It's good to change it.

423
00:18:53,608 --> 00:18:55,688
It's more than a game, I'm telling you.

424
00:18:55,688 --> 00:18:57,129
The people who invented the Internet and computers

425
00:18:57,129 --> 00:18:58,129
Are all villains.

426
00:18:58,409 --> 00:18:59,088
It's the network.

427
00:18:59,088 --> 00:19:00,448
Let me face these sins every day.

428
00:19:00,448 --> 00:19:02,409
We are addicted to the opium of the mind.

429
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:03,568
This is the white drug.

430
00:19:03,848 --> 00:19:04,848
We must unite.

431
00:19:05,088 --> 00:19:06,688
And smashed all the computers in the internet café.

432
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:08,289
Catch the people who invented the Internet and games.

433
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:09,848
You'll shock them 50 times a day.

434
00:19:10,448 --> 00:19:11,369
It's cheap.

435
00:19:12,088 --> 00:19:14,568
But there's some truth to it.

436
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:16,728
Sit down.

437
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,649
Let's invite this new ally

438
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:26,328
Yes, you should talk about it.

439
00:19:26,568 --> 00:19:29,769
How you'll feel when you're here.

440
00:19:34,209 --> 00:19:34,929
first

441
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:38,168
I want to thank Professor Yang for giving me this opportunity.

442
00:19:39,128 --> 00:19:41,648
I heard what some allies said just now.

443
00:19:42,128 --> 00:19:43,449
I think they are too shallow.

444
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:44,648
I didn't catch the point.

445
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:46,969
Although I came in for a short time,

446
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:48,689
But after listening to Professor Yang's class,

447
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:49,969
I've come to my senses.

448
00:19:50,128 --> 00:19:50,888
network

449
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:52,689
It's not harming people.

450
00:19:53,489 --> 00:19:54,449
It's killing people.

451
00:19:55,088 --> 00:19:56,328
Once you get this,

452
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:57,529
You won't be able to quit.

453
00:19:58,088 --> 00:19:58,808
first

454
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:00,648
Your eyes will be bad.

455
00:20:01,489 --> 00:20:02,128
second

456
00:20:02,128 --> 00:20:03,209
Your body will collapse.

457
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:04,249
Third

458
00:20:05,449 --> 00:20:06,449
Even lost his life.

459
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:07,328
Think about it.

460
00:20:07,328 --> 00:20:08,729
Without the evil network,

461
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:09,848
How wonderful the world is.

462
00:20:09,848 --> 00:20:10,969
We don't have to make friends.

463
00:20:10,969 --> 00:20:11,969
No need for online shopping.

464
00:20:11,969 --> 00:20:13,009
You don't need to search information online.

465
00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:15,009
We don't have to send emails.

466
00:20:16,689 --> 00:20:18,489
The ally said that

467
00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:20,328
He wants to smash all the computers in the internet café.

468
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:21,808
I think he's too soft.

469
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:25,249
If you want to smash it, you have to get rid of it.

470
00:20:25,648 --> 00:20:26,969
Not only all the computers in the internet café,

471
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:29,009
I have to unplug all the internet cables.

472
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:30,009
Everyone who's been on the Internet

473
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:31,168
Tie them all up for electric therapy.

474
00:20:31,168 --> 00:20:32,009
Don't you think so?

475
00:20:32,168 --> 00:20:33,128
Yes

476
00:20:33,848 --> 00:20:34,449
good

477
00:20:35,408 --> 00:20:36,848
We should start from ourselves.

478
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:38,209
Starting from us.

479
00:20:38,729 --> 00:20:39,888
To destroy the computers here.

480
00:20:40,328 --> 00:20:42,489
Unplug all the internet cables here.

481
00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:43,408
What do you think?

482
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,209
good

483
00:20:44,449 --> 00:20:48,969
Unplug the cable.

484
00:20:48,969 --> 00:20:49,969
Stop

485
00:20:49,969 --> 00:20:50,769
Unplug the cable.

486
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:53,648
The tricks you played

487
00:20:53,848 --> 00:20:55,769
Is the expression of severe internet addiction.

488
00:20:56,128 --> 00:20:57,568
It seems necessary.

489
00:20:57,568 --> 00:20:59,769
To treat you more deeply.

490
00:21:00,168 --> 00:21:00,929
Come on.

491
00:21:01,408 --> 00:21:02,648
Take it off.

492
00:21:07,128 --> 00:21:08,128
You're really something.

493
00:21:08,128 --> 00:21:09,328
On the first day.

494
00:21:09,328 --> 00:21:10,289
It's all a misunderstanding.

495
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:11,608
I said something wrong in a moment of excitement.

496
00:21:11,608 --> 00:21:12,529
I really regret it.

497
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:13,408
What are you doing?

498
00:21:13,408 --> 00:21:14,449
It's too late.

499
00:21:14,449 --> 00:21:15,888
You will be fine after treatment.

500
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:17,128
Let go of me!

501
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:20,648
49.

502
00:21:20,648 --> 00:21:21,648
And ran to the second floor.

503
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:22,408
Where are you going?

504
00:21:23,969 --> 00:21:24,729
Let go of me!

505
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,929
Brother Feng,

506
00:21:28,209 --> 00:21:28,848
Brother Feng,

507
00:21:29,808 --> 00:21:30,689
Take them with you.

508
00:21:31,128 --> 00:21:33,449
And help them with their meals.

509
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:34,289
What are you doing?

510
00:21:34,689 --> 00:21:35,249
Brother Feng,

511
00:21:36,009 --> 00:21:37,009
You can see it.

512
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:38,209
It's still quiet.

513
00:21:40,568 --> 00:21:42,608
Why don't you give it back? It can't be exposed.

514
00:21:42,608 --> 00:21:43,888
There must be something inside.

515
00:21:44,368 --> 00:21:45,368
Give me the phone. I'll do it.

516
00:21:45,368 --> 00:21:46,128
Let me have a look.

517
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:49,969
Let go of me!

518
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:51,328
obedient

519
00:21:51,328 --> 00:21:53,408
I'll give you a needle.

520
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:54,168
Let go of me!

521
00:21:55,929 --> 00:21:56,689
Let go of me!

522
00:22:00,648 --> 00:22:02,408
What are you doing? Let go of me!

523
00:22:06,568 --> 00:22:07,568
Syringe needle

524
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:11,249
Let go of me!

525
00:22:11,648 --> 00:22:12,449
Let go of me!

526
00:22:13,848 --> 00:22:15,848
You don't want to surf the Internet after the game.

527
00:22:24,249 --> 00:22:25,648
Lock the door.

528
00:22:25,648 --> 00:22:26,249
Brother Feng,

529
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:30,168
how could that be?

530
00:22:31,608 --> 00:22:32,689
What's the situation?

531
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:34,289
You've rebelled.

532
00:22:34,969 --> 00:22:36,689
The rebellion of 077 and 079.

533
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:37,408
Are you all right?

534
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:38,368
Nothing

535
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:39,648
I'll open the door.

536
00:23:06,888 --> 00:23:07,729
What's going on?

537
00:23:07,729 --> 00:23:08,209
Go back.

538
00:23:10,209 --> 00:23:11,009
Stop them!

539
00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:17,568
Close the door.

540
00:23:17,568 --> 00:23:19,009
Don't let them get away.

541
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,289
Close the gate.

542
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:24,568
We'll be in big trouble if they get away.

543
00:23:25,729 --> 00:23:26,368
Here comes the chance.

544
00:23:26,568 --> 00:23:27,249
Here comes the chance.

545
00:23:27,808 --> 00:23:29,128
Brother Feng, let's go.

546
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:42,408
maple

547
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,529
Brother Feng,

548
00:23:50,368 --> 00:23:51,368
Brother Feng,

549
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:52,848
Don't go inside.

550
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,088
There's dirt in it.

551
00:23:54,449 --> 00:23:55,368
Don't go.

552
00:23:55,888 --> 00:23:56,808
Open your hand.

553
00:23:58,608 --> 00:23:59,608
Old S.

554
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:00,888
Aren't you old S?

555
00:24:01,408 --> 00:24:02,529
I'm not old S.

556
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:04,808
I'm No.08.

557
00:24:04,808 --> 00:24:05,689
My name is Chang Sha.

558
00:24:05,689 --> 00:24:07,848
My home is on the 24th of Lishui Street.

559
00:24:07,848 --> 00:24:10,009
Say goodbye to Internet addiction and rebuild myself.

560
00:24:10,009 --> 00:24:11,368
Come on

561
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:12,449
A grateful heart.

562
00:24:12,449 --> 00:24:13,808
What happened

563
00:24:13,808 --> 00:24:15,408
Thank you for having me.

564
00:24:15,408 --> 00:24:16,249
Okay, stop singing. Come with me.

565
00:24:16,249 --> 00:24:17,088
Let me.

566
00:24:18,209 --> 00:24:20,009
Don't come in. You are not allowed in.

567
00:24:20,009 --> 00:24:21,049
I'm not going with you.

568
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:22,209
Stop it. Leave now.

569
00:24:22,209 --> 00:24:22,929
I'm not leaving.

570
00:24:23,608 --> 00:24:24,209
help

571
00:24:25,608 --> 00:24:26,608
Don't come in.

572
00:24:27,128 --> 00:24:28,328
Don't come in.

573
00:24:28,328 --> 00:24:28,808
Changsha

574
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:30,088
Changsha

575
00:24:30,088 --> 00:24:30,729
Look at me.

576
00:24:31,128 --> 00:24:32,249
I don't know you

577
00:24:32,449 --> 00:24:33,368
You really don't know her?

578
00:24:33,368 --> 00:24:34,128
Don't shock me.

579
00:24:34,128 --> 00:24:35,128
Take a look.

580
00:24:35,128 --> 00:24:35,969
You don't know her?

581
00:24:35,969 --> 00:24:36,769
I don't know you

582
00:24:41,729 --> 00:24:42,489
transport ship

583
00:24:42,489 --> 00:24:43,408
Feiyu Internet Cafe.

584
00:24:43,408 --> 00:24:44,848
Didn't you say that when we were investigating?

585
00:24:44,848 --> 00:24:46,128
Who loses? Grandson.

586
00:24:46,128 --> 00:24:47,689
We were right for 20 rounds.

587
00:24:47,689 --> 00:24:48,209
You didn't lose either.

588
00:24:48,209 --> 00:24:48,848
I didn't win either.

589
00:24:48,969 --> 00:24:49,888
Don't you remember?

590
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,088
There can only be one.

591
00:24:52,368 --> 00:24:53,648
Whoever loses is the grandson.

592
00:24:54,168 --> 00:24:56,088
You are Seven Xiao Feng.

593
00:24:56,088 --> 00:24:57,128
Right?

594
00:24:57,808 --> 00:24:59,729
Why are you like this?

595
00:24:59,729 --> 00:25:00,729
Don't touch my helmet.

596
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:03,128
Stop it. Let's go.

597
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:04,929
I'm not leaving.

598
00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:06,489
If you leave, you will be caught.

599
00:25:06,608 --> 00:25:07,049
you

600
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:07,729
Let's go.

601
00:25:07,729 --> 00:25:09,009
Let's go. It's the end of my life.

602
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:10,289
Repeated treatment is more painful.

603
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:10,729
Let's go.

604
00:25:10,848 --> 00:25:12,128
You can't get out.

605
00:25:17,328 --> 00:25:18,328
Hurry up.

606
00:25:18,328 --> 00:25:18,608
come

607
00:25:18,608 --> 00:25:19,168
quickly

608
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:30,289
Say goodbye to the internet addiction.

609
00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:31,328
To reinvent life.

610
00:25:31,328 --> 00:25:32,529
Come on

611
00:25:32,529 --> 00:25:34,529
A grateful heart.

612
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:35,969
I didn't mean to run.

613
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:41,729
Say goodbye to the internet addiction.

614
00:25:41,729 --> 00:25:42,289
To reinvent life.

615
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:44,209
Changsha

616
00:25:54,449 --> 00:25:55,648
Come on

617
00:25:55,648 --> 00:25:56,289
Say goodbye to the internet addiction.

618
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:57,128
To reinvent life.

619
00:25:57,128 --> 00:25:58,049
Come on

620
00:25:59,729 --> 00:26:00,529
Say goodbye to the internet addiction.

621
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:01,209
To reinvent life.

622
00:26:01,568 --> 00:26:02,769
Come on

623
00:26:11,648 --> 00:26:13,209
The fourth floor is under our control.

624
00:26:13,209 --> 00:26:13,969
Oh.

625
00:26:59,729 --> 00:27:00,529
Xiao Feng.

626
00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:09,249
Supervisory group

627
00:27:20,648 --> 00:27:21,888
chase

628
00:27:21,888 --> 00:27:22,848
here

629
00:27:23,368 --> 00:27:24,088
on

630
00:29:04,848 --> 00:29:06,209
Xiao Feng, hurry up.

631
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:07,128
Don't bother me.

632
00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:13,529
Hurry up.

633
00:29:19,969 --> 00:29:21,328
Get me a smoke machine.

634
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:22,128
Move out of my way

635
00:29:22,368 --> 00:29:24,489
You can't be punished.

636
00:29:28,848 --> 00:29:29,529
There's poison.

637
00:29:31,808 --> 00:29:32,568
Old Sha, go.

638
00:29:34,449 --> 00:29:34,929
Save us.

639
00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:35,648
Feng, hurry up.

640
00:29:35,848 --> 00:29:36,729
Let's go together.

641
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:40,689
go

642
00:29:54,529 --> 00:29:57,689
Get out of my way.

643
00:30:01,808 --> 00:30:02,808
Get out of the way

644
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:24,929
I will.

645
00:30:26,888 --> 00:30:27,729
I remember now.

646
00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:28,888
Come with me.

647
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:35,128
Why are you here again?

648
00:30:36,729 --> 00:30:38,249
No one knows this place better than I do.

649
00:30:38,729 --> 00:30:41,568
Today, the escape plan I designed before

650
00:30:41,848 --> 00:30:42,848
Three days earlier.

651
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:45,408
Are you sane?

652
00:30:56,009 --> 00:30:57,088
You said I was abnormal.

653
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:09,408
Al-Amin

654
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:35,969
Seven, Xiao Feng.

655
00:31:39,249 --> 00:31:41,648
This is the exit.

656
00:31:47,608 --> 00:31:48,729
He must be crazy.

657
00:32:22,249 --> 00:32:22,888
nine

658
00:32:25,168 --> 00:32:25,769
eight

659
00:32:29,009 --> 00:32:29,608
seven

660
00:32:31,848 --> 00:32:32,568
six

661
00:32:33,969 --> 00:32:34,568
five

662
00:32:37,328 --> 00:32:37,769
four

663
00:32:41,368 --> 00:32:42,168
three

664
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:43,289
hidden

665
00:32:57,368 --> 00:33:00,128
Play dodging with me. Come on.

666
00:33:07,808 --> 00:33:08,608
I will.

667
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:12,328
hurry up

668
00:33:29,689 --> 00:33:30,128
fast

669
00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:31,328
fast

670
00:33:31,328 --> 00:33:31,969
Xiao Feng.

671
00:33:32,568 --> 00:33:33,049
Hurry up.

672
00:33:34,368 --> 00:33:35,328
Get in the car.

673
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,289
fast

674
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:41,969
stop

675
00:33:42,328 --> 00:33:43,009
stop

676
00:33:43,328 --> 00:33:44,009
stop

677
00:33:44,209 --> 00:33:44,888
stop

678
00:33:45,969 --> 00:33:47,489
How did you know we were in that room?

679
00:33:47,769 --> 00:33:48,689
Your window

680
00:33:48,689 --> 00:33:50,168
It's so big A.

681
00:33:50,168 --> 00:33:51,088
You must see it.

682
00:34:01,568 --> 00:34:02,328
Get him here.

683
00:34:02,328 --> 00:34:03,449
What's next?

684
00:34:04,929 --> 00:34:06,009
He dared not go home.

685
00:34:06,568 --> 00:34:08,009
He ran away several times before.

686
00:34:08,009 --> 00:34:09,808
I was sent back by my family just after I got home.

687
00:34:14,769 --> 00:34:15,808
Have some water.

688
00:34:15,808 --> 00:34:16,929
Come on

689
00:34:17,209 --> 00:34:18,888
Old sand.

690
00:34:19,608 --> 00:34:20,128
Old sand.

691
00:34:21,888 --> 00:34:22,608
Old sand.

692
00:34:23,689 --> 00:34:24,529
Old sand.

693
00:34:25,529 --> 00:34:26,289
Nothing

694
00:34:27,568 --> 00:34:28,729
There's only one spy.

695
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:30,049
Seven

696
00:34:32,568 --> 00:34:33,128
Seven

697
00:34:33,808 --> 00:34:34,328
Seven

698
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:35,808
Who is she?

699
00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:36,608
I don't know her.

700
00:34:37,009 --> 00:34:38,168
She's an anaesthetist.

701
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:38,449
She's not.

702
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:39,689
Sent by Professor Yang.

703
00:34:39,689 --> 00:34:40,529
She's not.

704
00:34:40,529 --> 00:34:41,168
Old sand.

705
00:34:41,689 --> 00:34:43,408
She's my roommate, An Lan.

706
00:34:43,729 --> 00:34:44,648
It has nothing to do with Professor Yang.

707
00:34:45,368 --> 00:34:46,049
professor

708
00:34:46,769 --> 00:34:47,929
Professor An.

709
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:49,128
Hello, Professor An.

710
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:49,808
Professor An.

711
00:34:49,808 --> 00:34:51,929
I am Chang Sha. I'm 24 years old.

712
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:53,449
She lives in Lishui Alley.

713
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:54,729
Today is the day I get rid of my internet addiction.

714
00:34:54,729 --> 00:34:56,289
One hundred and eighty-nine days.

715
00:34:56,289 --> 00:34:57,168
Stay away from the internet.

716
00:34:57,168 --> 00:34:58,128
Refuse the temptation.

717
00:34:58,128 --> 00:34:59,689
Grateful parents embrace life.

718
00:34:59,689 --> 00:35:00,888
Come on

719
00:35:00,888 --> 00:35:02,888
A grateful heart.

720
00:35:02,888 --> 00:35:04,929
Thank you for having me.

721
00:35:04,929 --> 00:35:06,289
Let me spend my whole life

722
00:35:06,289 --> 00:35:06,929
Old sand.

723
00:35:06,929 --> 00:35:08,648
I have the courage to be myself.

724
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:09,529
Old sand.

725
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,049
This is not the Internet Addiction Center.

726
00:35:12,769 --> 00:35:13,608
This is my home.

727
00:35:14,249 --> 00:35:14,648
Who am I?

728
00:35:16,969 --> 00:35:17,689
Seven

729
00:35:17,689 --> 00:35:19,689
Yes, we escaped.

730
00:35:21,929 --> 00:35:22,489
we

731
00:35:22,969 --> 00:35:23,729
And escaped.

732
00:35:25,689 --> 00:35:27,128
Our plan succeeded.

733
00:35:29,249 --> 00:35:30,249
impossible

734
00:35:30,368 --> 00:35:30,888
Really

735
00:35:30,888 --> 00:35:32,088
We can't escape.

736
00:35:32,408 --> 00:35:32,848
To escape.

737
00:35:32,848 --> 00:35:34,009
impossible

738
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:34,808
It's true.

739
00:35:35,689 --> 00:35:37,009
We escaped together.

740
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:38,648
And has called the police.

741
00:35:39,568 --> 00:35:42,848
There's no way, Professor Yang, we can't get out.

742
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:44,088
What's impossible?

743
00:35:44,328 --> 00:35:46,128
How hard did you work to get it?

744
00:35:46,128 --> 00:35:47,368
My wrist still hurts.

745
00:35:47,568 --> 00:35:48,049
Shut up!

746
00:35:48,449 --> 00:35:49,449
I'm scared.

747
00:35:50,088 --> 00:35:51,929
Who is that woman?

748
00:35:52,088 --> 00:35:53,608
He's not a woman. He is a man.

749
00:35:54,249 --> 00:35:55,808
I don't know him.

750
00:35:55,808 --> 00:35:57,209
Nothing

751
00:35:57,209 --> 00:35:57,808
Be not afraid of

752
00:35:57,808 --> 00:36:00,969
Professor Yang will take us back.

753
00:36:00,969 --> 00:36:02,568
No, don't worry.

754
00:36:02,568 --> 00:36:03,769
This is my home.

755
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:06,209
You can sleep here.

756
00:36:06,449 --> 00:36:07,769
Professor Yang's scoundrel.

757
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:09,408
Was taken away by the police.

758
00:36:09,408 --> 00:36:10,929
They won't be able to get away with it.

759
00:36:12,729 --> 00:36:13,449
fine

760
00:36:13,449 --> 00:36:14,049
Be in jail

761
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:15,209
If they feel better,

762
00:36:15,209 --> 00:36:17,408
乖 来 我们脱衣服 来

763
00:36:18,769 --> 00:36:19,289
Stand up.

764
00:36:19,568 --> 00:36:20,088
come

765
00:36:23,009 --> 00:36:24,128
Take them off.

766
00:36:25,289 --> 00:36:26,489
I'll sleep on the couch.

767
00:36:26,489 --> 00:36:27,529
Alright. Go to sleep.

768
00:36:27,529 --> 00:36:29,209
They came for me. I'm fast.

769
00:36:29,209 --> 00:36:29,848
good

770
00:36:30,408 --> 00:36:31,368
they

771
00:36:31,368 --> 00:36:33,208
What happened in there.

772
00:36:33,849 --> 00:36:34,608
I have no idea

773
00:36:35,009 --> 00:36:36,449
It's a little weird.

774
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:47,608
Xiao Feng, listen to me.

775
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:49,009
Let him stay here today.

776
00:36:49,489 --> 00:36:51,369
What about tomorrow? What next?

777
00:36:51,688 --> 00:36:52,529
I never thought about it.

778
00:36:53,009 --> 00:36:54,329
I just feel sorry for him.

779
00:36:54,329 --> 00:36:56,168
I used to think our business

780
00:36:56,168 --> 00:36:57,088
It's not easy.

781
00:36:57,768 --> 00:36:58,929
I saw him today.

782
00:36:59,929 --> 00:37:01,009
I think we're lucky.

783
00:37:01,009 --> 00:37:02,168
There are so many poor people.

784
00:37:02,168 --> 00:37:03,288
Can you manage it?

785
00:37:03,288 --> 00:37:04,369
You're the boss.

786
00:37:06,248 --> 00:37:08,168
You have crossed the river.

787
00:37:08,168 --> 00:37:09,688
Don't you make trouble for yourself?

788
00:37:09,969 --> 00:37:10,608
Lieutenant

789
00:37:11,168 --> 00:37:12,608
Haven't you seen Old S before?

790
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,768
When we were in Feiyu Internet café,

791
00:37:14,768 --> 00:37:16,208
That's

792
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:17,489
I'm telling you, it's the same as the body.

793
00:37:17,608 --> 00:37:18,288
You're amazing.

794
00:37:18,648 --> 00:37:19,809
As long as he wants to kill people,

795
00:37:19,809 --> 00:37:20,969
No one can escape.

796
00:37:20,969 --> 00:37:21,529
You know,

797
00:37:21,728 --> 00:37:23,168
Who makes my hands sweat.

798
00:37:23,168 --> 00:37:23,809
How many are there?

799
00:37:24,248 --> 00:37:25,529
Even if he is one of them,

800
00:37:25,929 --> 00:37:26,728
yes

801
00:37:27,449 --> 00:37:28,809
But look at him now.

802
00:37:28,809 --> 00:37:29,849
Wzy

803
00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:30,768
She's out of her mind.

804
00:37:30,768 --> 00:37:31,568
To stay here.

805
00:37:31,568 --> 00:37:32,849
Don't do anything wrong.

806
00:37:33,369 --> 00:37:34,768
Others already treat him as a monster.

807
00:37:34,969 --> 00:37:36,248
Let's treat him as a monster again.

808
00:37:36,449 --> 00:37:37,768
He will be dead.

809
00:37:38,648 --> 00:37:39,688
Have you thought about it?

810
00:37:39,688 --> 00:37:41,648
Maybe tomorrow morning, the police station

811
00:37:41,648 --> 00:37:42,809
Will inform Ming's parents.

812
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:43,849
After a while,

813
00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:45,369
The police will find us here.

814
00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:46,849
What should we do?

815
00:37:47,688 --> 00:37:48,728
They're coming.

816
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:49,969
I'll handle it.

817
00:37:50,688 --> 00:37:51,248
you

818
00:37:52,489 --> 00:37:53,489
This is my job.

819
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:55,288
Go to bed early.

820
00:37:55,288 --> 00:37:56,688
There are two more games tomorrow.

821
00:38:05,728 --> 00:38:06,449
Where is Lao Sha?

822
00:38:16,688 --> 00:38:17,648
Why are you climbing so high?

823
00:38:17,648 --> 00:38:18,369
Get down from there.

824
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:22,969
Professor Yang can't find this place.

825
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:24,088
You can sleep.

826
00:38:24,088 --> 00:38:25,849
I'll sleep on it tonight.

827
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:27,369
I've told you.

828
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:28,768
Professor Yang can't find her here.

829
00:38:28,768 --> 00:38:30,568
You forgot to come down.

830
00:38:31,088 --> 00:38:31,849
I'm not going down.

831
00:38:32,128 --> 00:38:33,568
There are rats on it.

832
00:38:33,568 --> 00:38:34,849
I'm playing with a big mouse.

833
00:38:35,728 --> 00:38:37,288
Aren't you afraid that a mouse will bite you?

834
00:38:37,288 --> 00:38:38,288
The big mouse won't bite me.

835
00:38:38,288 --> 00:38:39,088
You can sleep.

836
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:39,889
Come down.

837
00:38:39,889 --> 00:38:40,529
I won't.

838
00:38:41,128 --> 00:38:42,688
Come down.

839
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:43,889
Come down.

840
00:38:44,728 --> 00:38:45,449
Come down.

841
00:38:46,288 --> 00:38:47,049
Big Mouse!

842
00:38:47,809 --> 00:38:48,728
Get down from there.

843
00:38:49,009 --> 00:38:49,728
Big Hedgehog.

844
00:38:50,648 --> 00:38:51,409
Come down.

845
00:38:52,208 --> 00:38:53,128
Big bat.

846
00:38:55,288 --> 00:38:55,768
This is

847
00:38:59,728 --> 00:39:00,529
Wait for me.

848
00:39:07,489 --> 00:39:08,489
Don't throw it.

849
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:15,969
Old sand.

850
00:39:17,449 --> 00:39:18,409
What is this?

851
00:39:19,768 --> 00:39:20,608
Is it good or not?

852
00:39:21,608 --> 00:39:22,449
Can't you get down?

853
00:39:24,688 --> 00:39:25,889
Did you put the ham sausage?

854
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,208
There's no ham sausage.

855
00:39:28,728 --> 00:39:30,088
Or lunch meat.

856
00:39:30,088 --> 00:39:31,409
I can't go down without meat.

857
00:39:32,168 --> 00:39:32,449
No

858
00:39:32,449 --> 00:39:34,529
Where can I find lunch meat at night?

859
00:39:34,688 --> 00:39:35,168
I think

860
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,288
I think you should wait.

861
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:54,889
I found it.

862
00:39:57,449 --> 00:39:58,128
Spam

863
00:39:59,329 --> 00:40:00,049
to wait a moment

864
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:02,688
This is January 2006.

865
00:40:02,688 --> 00:40:04,088
Has expired for two years.

866
00:40:04,409 --> 00:40:05,208
Is there?

867
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:06,329
Nothing

868
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:06,849
Look.

869
00:40:07,369 --> 00:40:08,248
It's not expired.

870
00:40:08,248 --> 00:40:09,128
Look carefully.

871
00:40:09,128 --> 00:40:11,568
It says the best date.

872
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:18,489
to make sense

873
00:40:20,969 --> 00:40:22,969
The lunch meat hasn't expired.

874
00:40:24,449 --> 00:40:25,409
I think so.

875
00:40:35,889 --> 00:40:36,648
This is for you.

876
00:40:38,608 --> 00:40:39,409
This is for you.

877
00:40:43,049 --> 00:40:44,168
Ming, eat more.

878
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:15,168
Hundred Cities League.

879
00:41:15,168 --> 00:41:17,329
Has entered the stage of intense heat.

880
00:41:17,329 --> 00:41:18,049
The champion.

881
00:41:18,049 --> 00:41:20,168
Is a strong Strider team.

882
00:41:20,168 --> 00:41:22,449
With King leading the way,

883
00:41:22,449 --> 00:41:24,529
The Langya Team followed in second place.

884
00:41:24,529 --> 00:41:25,409
At the same time,

885
00:41:25,409 --> 00:41:26,728
We can see that

886
00:41:26,728 --> 00:41:28,128
Is making progress.

887
00:41:28,128 --> 00:41:28,568
before

888
00:41:28,568 --> 00:41:29,449
On the leaderboard,

889
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:31,128
You can't see them at all.

890
00:41:31,128 --> 00:41:31,849
But now,

891
00:41:31,849 --> 00:41:34,208
They're already ranked 17.

892
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,889
But the gap is still big.

893
00:41:52,369 --> 00:41:53,369
Answer it.

894
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:58,768
Finally connected.

895
00:41:58,768 --> 00:41:59,529
you

896
00:41:59,529 --> 00:42:00,489
To find Lu Xiaonan?

897
00:42:00,688 --> 00:42:02,529
You found me, and you brought my words.

898
00:42:02,969 --> 00:42:04,128
Did you see my brother in person?

899
00:42:04,409 --> 00:42:05,168
What did he say?

900
00:42:05,529 --> 00:42:06,329
He...

901
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,728
Anyway, I told him not to go.

902
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:10,688
To watch the game tomorrow.

903
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:13,688
Have you seen him in person?

904
00:42:13,688 --> 00:42:15,449
My mouth is worn out.

905
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,329
The guard of your school wouldn't let me in.

906
00:42:17,809 --> 00:42:19,489
I happened to meet your brother's head teacher.

907
00:42:19,489 --> 00:42:20,608
I told him.

908
00:42:20,608 --> 00:42:22,288
He said he would bring the message.

909
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:23,889
This is not good.

910
00:42:25,088 --> 00:42:25,449
Xiao Feng.

911
00:42:26,009 --> 00:42:27,728
Go to my brother right now.

912
00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:29,529
Now?

913
00:42:29,809 --> 00:42:30,409
Yes

914
00:42:30,929 --> 00:42:32,568
Look at the time.

915
00:42:32,768 --> 00:42:34,168
Where can I find your brother?

916
00:42:35,728 --> 00:42:36,728
Then call my home.

917
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:38,369
Can't we play tomorrow?

918
00:42:38,768 --> 00:42:38,969
Right?

919
00:42:38,969 --> 00:42:40,409
We finally connected.

920
00:42:40,409 --> 00:42:41,568
I have so many things to ask you.

921
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,688
I won't tell you anything if you don't hit me now.

922
00:42:44,489 --> 00:42:45,489
What's the phone number?

923
00:42:45,809 --> 00:42:47,489
Eight seven six four three two four.

924
00:42:47,489 --> 00:42:48,889
Put the phone on, I want to listen.

925
00:42:49,128 --> 00:42:52,568
Eight seven six four three two four.

926
00:43:08,489 --> 00:43:09,208
feed

927
00:43:09,648 --> 00:43:10,849
Hello, hello.

928
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:12,969
I want to find Lu Xiaonan.

929
00:43:13,248 --> 00:43:14,969
Call me tomorrow if you need help.

930
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:16,128
Mom, it's so late.

931
00:43:16,128 --> 00:43:17,128
Who called?

932
00:43:17,768 --> 00:43:19,489
Go to bed. What time is it?

933
00:43:19,489 --> 00:43:20,768
Tomorrow, I will stay in bed.

934
00:43:20,768 --> 00:43:21,608
Good night, Mum.

935
00:43:21,929 --> 00:43:23,449
Hello, hello. I have heavy.

936
00:43:25,929 --> 00:43:27,768
Look, I told you to call me tomorrow.

937
00:43:28,768 --> 00:43:29,688
Try again.

938
00:43:29,889 --> 00:43:30,568
good

939
00:43:36,049 --> 00:43:36,969
You can't get through, right?

940
00:43:40,889 --> 00:43:41,608
Xiao Feng.

941
00:43:42,608 --> 00:43:44,648
Go to my home tomorrow. Go and find my brother.

942
00:43:45,329 --> 00:43:47,688
Unit One, Unit 1, 102, 47 Xinmen Street.

943
00:43:48,168 --> 00:43:49,128
Help me this time.

944
00:43:49,489 --> 00:43:50,489
What do you want me to do from now on?

945
00:43:50,489 --> 00:43:51,288
I promised you

946
00:43:53,208 --> 00:43:53,809
good

947
00:43:54,128 --> 00:43:54,969
Write it down.

948
00:43:56,889 --> 00:43:58,608
Xinmen Street.

949
00:43:59,329 --> 00:44:00,929
No.47, Xinmen Street

950
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,489
No.47.

951
00:44:03,049 --> 00:44:04,168
One unit.

952
00:44:05,529 --> 00:44:06,369
One hundred and two.

953
00:44:06,369 --> 00:44:06,889
good

954
00:44:06,889 --> 00:44:07,768
Certain

955
00:44:07,768 --> 00:44:09,329
We must stop him from going to the game.

956
00:44:10,009 --> 00:44:11,208
I was wondering

957
00:44:11,809 --> 00:44:13,688
Why did you stop your brother from going to the game?

958
00:44:17,009 --> 00:44:18,529
Because on his way to the game,

959
00:44:19,608 --> 00:44:20,809
Will die in a car crash.

960
00:44:53,809 --> 00:44:56,248
There was a serious car accident on Nanshan Road.

961
00:44:56,248 --> 00:44:58,529
One dead and one seriously injured.

962
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,208
Police are looking for witnesses

963
00:45:00,208 --> 00:45:02,329
The injured are being rescued in the hospital.

964
00:45:02,329 --> 00:45:03,529
The hit-and-run vehicle has escaped.
