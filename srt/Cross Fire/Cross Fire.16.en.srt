1
00:02:28,644 --> 00:02:29,720
I can't fight anymore.

2
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:33,297
Find someone else.

3
00:02:33,697 --> 00:02:34,457
why

4
00:02:35,217 --> 00:02:36,136
Is something wrong?

5
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:39,297
I don't have much time.

6
00:02:39,297 --> 00:02:41,497
What do you mean I don't have much time?

7
00:02:41,497 --> 00:02:42,857
If you are not ill,

8
00:02:42,857 --> 00:02:44,296
Why are you here?

9
00:02:45,537 --> 00:02:46,776
I'm not sick.

10
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,377
But Grandma does.

11
00:02:48,657 --> 00:02:49,857
She needs to be looked after.

12
00:02:51,817 --> 00:02:53,456
Isn't your grandmother going abroad?

13
00:02:53,456 --> 00:02:54,977
That was my parents' decision.

14
00:02:55,337 --> 00:02:56,936
But none of us want to leave.

15
00:02:57,896 --> 00:02:58,976
It's right not to go.

16
00:02:59,616 --> 00:03:01,177
Medical conditions in Vietnam

17
00:03:01,177 --> 00:03:02,537
It's not as good as our country.

18
00:03:02,537 --> 00:03:04,576
I don't know what your parents think.

19
00:03:04,777 --> 00:03:05,777
How old is your grandmother?

20
00:03:05,777 --> 00:03:08,376
It's a big problem to go abroad for a new environment.

21
00:03:08,616 --> 00:03:09,896
They don't know

22
00:03:10,016 --> 00:03:11,296
But the business is over there.

23
00:03:11,296 --> 00:03:12,737
The whole family lives on this.

24
00:03:13,137 --> 00:03:14,656
Grandma knows I want to stay.

25
00:03:15,217 --> 00:03:16,976
In order to let me continue to play e-sports,

26
00:03:17,857 --> 00:03:19,576
She said she wanted to live in a nursing home alone.

27
00:03:20,656 --> 00:03:21,417
Tell me,

28
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:23,016
Can I leave her there alone?

29
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,696
Why didn't you let your grandmother into the nursing home?

30
00:03:26,696 --> 00:03:28,817
The conditions in nursing homes are much better than at home.

31
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:30,296
The hotel apartment of Yi Shui'er.

32
00:03:30,296 --> 00:03:32,176
There are special doctors and nurses.

33
00:03:32,176 --> 00:03:34,257
And has a rich daily life.

34
00:03:34,497 --> 00:03:35,497
It's more relaxing.

35
00:03:35,697 --> 00:03:37,337
Are you talking about a nursing home?

36
00:03:37,857 --> 00:03:39,096
It must be good.

37
00:03:40,497 --> 00:03:41,777
But I don't have any access.

38
00:03:43,497 --> 00:03:46,217
I heard it will take half a year.

39
00:03:48,217 --> 00:03:50,816
Actually, the door is right in front of you.

40
00:03:50,816 --> 00:03:51,977
About the nursing home.

41
00:03:52,096 --> 00:03:53,176
Cheng Hao can do it for you.

42
00:03:55,217 --> 00:03:56,536
And gave me problems.

43
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,417
Your father must have a way.

44
00:03:59,217 --> 00:04:00,137
Let me try.

45
00:04:00,137 --> 00:04:00,977
You know that my dad and I

46
00:04:00,977 --> 00:04:02,217
We haven't contacted each other for many years.

47
00:04:03,816 --> 00:04:04,697
In that case,

48
00:04:05,057 --> 00:04:06,337
Your parents

49
00:04:06,337 --> 00:04:07,536
I have to handle it myself.

50
00:04:08,096 --> 00:04:09,536
We have too many things.

51
00:04:09,536 --> 00:04:10,576
I don't want it if I can.

52
00:04:10,777 --> 00:04:12,016
You don't need them.

53
00:04:15,897 --> 00:04:17,057
I'm not going with you.

54
00:04:17,217 --> 00:04:18,016
I want to stay.

55
00:04:18,137 --> 00:04:20,016
Why are you staying here?

56
00:04:20,016 --> 00:04:21,016
Who said they're gone?

57
00:04:21,016 --> 00:04:22,137
Who said they're gone?

58
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:22,736
My grandma won't leave.

59
00:04:22,736 --> 00:04:23,697
I'm not leaving either.

60
00:04:25,857 --> 00:04:28,096
Did he spoil you? I'm telling you.

61
00:04:28,096 --> 00:04:29,736
We have to leave.

62
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:30,897
I sold the house.

63
00:04:30,897 --> 00:04:31,617
Where are you going?

64
00:04:31,736 --> 00:04:32,536
And your grandma.

65
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:33,897
Let's go to Vietnam together.

66
00:04:34,017 --> 00:04:36,057
Who is that?

67
00:04:36,057 --> 00:04:37,856
I've arranged everything.

68
00:04:38,457 --> 00:04:40,696
Mom, you just recovered.

69
00:04:40,696 --> 00:04:41,656
Go back to your room and rest.

70
00:04:41,737 --> 00:04:42,696
yes

71
00:04:42,777 --> 00:04:44,376
I'll go back and lie down.

72
00:04:44,536 --> 00:04:47,457
So you can force my grandson?

73
00:04:47,856 --> 00:04:48,737
mom

74
00:04:49,577 --> 00:04:50,737
Don't argue with me.

75
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:51,856
all right?

76
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,577
I'm your son.

77
00:04:53,577 --> 00:04:54,696
You don't know me?

78
00:04:54,856 --> 00:04:55,816
I'm telling you,

79
00:04:56,017 --> 00:04:57,136
It's a stretcher.

80
00:04:57,136 --> 00:04:57,816
Lift

81
00:04:58,457 --> 00:04:59,737
To carry you to Vietnam.

82
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:05,017
Go to Vietnam.

83
00:05:05,816 --> 00:05:08,177
Mom, why did you cut it?

84
00:05:08,177 --> 00:05:09,136
You just cut it off.

85
00:05:09,136 --> 00:05:10,217
Let's make up for it.

86
00:05:10,217 --> 00:05:11,577
You've come down in ten days.

87
00:05:12,577 --> 00:05:14,536
Fill it up.

88
00:05:15,936 --> 00:05:16,976
Fill it up.

89
00:05:17,096 --> 00:05:17,936
Alright, alright.

90
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:19,177
Tear it up.

91
00:05:19,177 --> 00:05:20,177
Cut it.

92
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,017
Wang Kai

93
00:05:23,017 --> 00:05:24,497
Look, you left your parents

94
00:05:24,497 --> 00:05:26,177
What's your grandmother doing?

95
00:05:26,256 --> 00:05:27,177
And persuade your grandma.

96
00:05:27,177 --> 00:05:28,737
Come with us, okay?

97
00:05:28,737 --> 00:05:29,217
I told you.

98
00:05:29,217 --> 00:05:30,457
I'm not going to Vietnam.

99
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:31,777
Son of a bitch.

100
00:05:31,856 --> 00:05:32,897
Beat you to death.

101
00:05:35,136 --> 00:05:36,457
Why are you looking at me?

102
00:05:36,457 --> 00:05:37,656
You want to fight back?

103
00:05:37,656 --> 00:05:39,976
It's right for me to hit my son.

104
00:05:40,777 --> 00:05:42,057
I told you to hit my son.

105
00:05:42,057 --> 00:05:42,856
Natural Rules and Orderliness

106
00:05:42,856 --> 00:05:43,577
mom

107
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:45,856
It's right for me to hit my son.

108
00:05:46,057 --> 00:05:47,376
I'm telling you two,

109
00:05:47,497 --> 00:05:49,256
You two should go back wherever you want.

110
00:05:49,256 --> 00:05:50,177
How to make money.

111
00:05:50,177 --> 00:05:51,936
Earn your money.

112
00:05:52,096 --> 00:05:52,856
Hey, Kai.

113
00:05:52,856 --> 00:05:55,057
Study your e-sports.

114
00:05:55,497 --> 00:05:58,057
As for the old lady, it's easier to handle.

115
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,656
The old lady lives in a nursing home.

116
00:06:00,656 --> 00:06:02,136
Let's go our own way.

117
00:06:02,136 --> 00:06:03,497
It doesn't bother anyone.

118
00:06:04,737 --> 00:06:05,376
mom

119
00:06:05,577 --> 00:06:06,816
The conditions of the nursing home.

120
00:06:07,177 --> 00:06:08,577
Can we rest assured?

121
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:09,856
Don't worry.

122
00:06:09,856 --> 00:06:11,737
Grandma went to the city nursing home.

123
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:13,217
Do you know the rooms in the nursing home?

124
00:06:13,217 --> 00:06:14,737
You're so nervous. Do you know?

125
00:06:14,737 --> 00:06:16,057
My friend can handle it.

126
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:32,696
son

127
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:36,936
You finally showed up.

128
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:39,777
Are you short of money?

129
00:06:40,136 --> 00:06:40,936
No

130
00:06:41,136 --> 00:06:42,257
I'm not here for money.

131
00:06:42,257 --> 00:06:44,616
What do you want to eat?

132
00:06:45,176 --> 00:06:46,017
Go ahead.

133
00:06:46,457 --> 00:06:47,856
I promised.

134
00:06:48,096 --> 00:06:49,577
After you divorced my mother,

135
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:51,697
I won't ask you for anything.

136
00:06:51,697 --> 00:06:52,817
I won't beg you to do anything.

137
00:06:53,536 --> 00:06:54,976
After so many years,

138
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:57,017
You haven't forgiven me yet.

139
00:06:57,257 --> 00:06:58,457
Give me a chance.

140
00:06:58,457 --> 00:06:59,856
Let me do something for you.

141
00:07:01,736 --> 00:07:02,897
You owe my mom an apology.

142
00:07:04,496 --> 00:07:05,176
Besides this,

143
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:05,976
Don't talk about anything else.

144
00:07:07,656 --> 00:07:08,496
Wait

145
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:10,337
Alright, alright.

146
00:07:10,616 --> 00:07:11,416
I apologize.

147
00:07:11,656 --> 00:07:13,096
The time and place are up to you.

148
00:07:14,496 --> 00:07:15,296
good

149
00:07:15,577 --> 00:07:16,697
I've made a decision. Let me tell you.

150
00:07:28,577 --> 00:07:29,817
Are you looking for me today?

151
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:31,017
This matter

152
00:07:32,496 --> 00:07:33,377
There's another thing.

153
00:07:33,777 --> 00:07:34,897
But I don't think you can do it.

154
00:07:34,897 --> 00:07:35,697
Forget it.

155
00:07:35,697 --> 00:07:37,736
This place in Ningjiang

156
00:07:38,337 --> 00:07:40,056
And what my father can't do.

157
00:07:43,056 --> 00:07:43,976
My friend, his grandmother.

158
00:07:43,976 --> 00:07:45,296
If you want to enter the city nursing home,

159
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:46,337
Can you handle it?

160
00:07:46,817 --> 00:07:48,017
This matter

161
00:07:49,577 --> 00:07:51,337
Lu Xiao Bei is right.

162
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:54,296
My problem of bragging is really genetic.

163
00:07:54,577 --> 00:07:55,577
Wait

164
00:07:56,217 --> 00:07:57,296
Give me three days.

165
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,257
I promise I can handle it for you.

166
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,377
But there's a condition.

167
00:08:05,377 --> 00:08:07,577
You can't block my phone number and WeChat.

168
00:08:07,937 --> 00:08:09,976
You can't see each other for months.

169
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:15,937
Lieutenant

170
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:17,296
Are you really hanging up?

171
00:08:18,217 --> 00:08:20,217
I really had no choice that day.

172
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:23,217
We finally managed to climb to the present.

173
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,457
I don't want others to kick us down.

174
00:08:25,616 --> 00:08:26,856
In this way,

175
00:08:28,176 --> 00:08:28,736
But I always think

176
00:08:28,736 --> 00:08:30,377
It's like we stole the champion.

177
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:31,296
It's not authentic.

178
00:08:32,536 --> 00:08:33,457
You spend all day

179
00:08:33,457 --> 00:08:35,856
Wire the corridor switch to steal other people's appliances.

180
00:08:35,856 --> 00:08:36,937
Why don't you think it's not authentic?

181
00:08:36,937 --> 00:08:38,416
Can it be the same?

182
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,017
How is it different?

183
00:08:39,017 --> 00:08:40,656
We're talking about you opening the plug-in.

184
00:08:40,656 --> 00:08:42,017
What does it have to do with me?

185
00:08:42,017 --> 00:08:43,137
That's enough.

186
00:08:43,137 --> 00:08:44,777
Don't argue.

187
00:08:44,976 --> 00:08:47,176
It's not the same thing now.

188
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,536
The point is,

189
00:08:48,536 --> 00:08:50,616
If this matter is discovered,

190
00:08:50,616 --> 00:08:51,616
What should we do?

191
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,817
What's more,

192
00:08:52,817 --> 00:08:53,616
You have to let others

193
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,017
What do you think of the team?

194
00:08:55,096 --> 00:08:56,736
We won't tell anyone about this.

195
00:08:56,817 --> 00:08:58,017
Nothing happened.

196
00:08:58,017 --> 00:08:59,337
If one day someone knows,

197
00:08:59,337 --> 00:09:00,697
As long as we don't admit it,

198
00:09:00,697 --> 00:09:01,656
They don't have any evidence.

199
00:09:01,656 --> 00:09:02,856
I won't say it.

200
00:09:03,856 --> 00:09:04,496
just

201
00:09:04,616 --> 00:09:05,536
I'm a coward.

202
00:09:05,897 --> 00:09:07,656
I'm afraid I can't sleep at night.

203
00:09:07,656 --> 00:09:08,736
I've thought about it.

204
00:09:08,736 --> 00:09:09,777
You have to admit your mistakes.

205
00:09:09,777 --> 00:09:10,937
Or I will add more mistakes.

206
00:09:11,096 --> 00:09:13,337
How can I admit it?

207
00:09:13,337 --> 00:09:15,416
To tell them that we cheated.

208
00:09:15,777 --> 00:09:17,257
I've asked An Lan to go to the match committee.

209
00:09:17,337 --> 00:09:18,017
Brother Feng,

210
00:09:18,096 --> 00:09:20,377
How about we talk about it?

211
00:09:20,377 --> 00:09:21,416
We can't discuss it.

212
00:09:21,577 --> 00:09:22,616
You have to admit your mistakes.

213
00:09:22,616 --> 00:09:23,697
This is our only way.

214
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:24,697
There might be hope.

215
00:09:26,937 --> 00:09:27,457
I have an appointment.

216
00:09:27,457 --> 00:09:28,817
Go to the office tomorrow morning.

217
00:09:29,096 --> 00:09:30,257
Are you really going?

218
00:09:30,577 --> 00:09:31,257
Why do I feel

219
00:09:31,257 --> 00:09:33,257
It's like jumping into a fire pit.

220
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:36,217
The captain's behavior is understandable.

221
00:09:36,217 --> 00:09:37,897
He's doing it for the team.

222
00:09:37,897 --> 00:09:39,697
How about we

223
00:09:40,017 --> 00:09:41,656
And discuss about it.

224
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:42,937
I've told you.

225
00:09:42,937 --> 00:09:44,736
It's not up for discussion. We must go.

226
00:09:44,736 --> 00:09:45,897
Have you thought about the consequences?

227
00:09:46,457 --> 00:09:47,897
The qualification for the competition may be up in a minute.

228
00:09:47,897 --> 00:09:48,937
You have to admit your mistakes.

229
00:09:48,937 --> 00:09:49,937
This is a truth that all children know.

230
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:51,257
But we're not kids anymore.

231
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,257
If it gets out,

232
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:52,976
Even a spittle can.

233
00:09:52,976 --> 00:09:54,137
To drown us.

234
00:09:54,137 --> 00:09:54,496
In the future,

235
00:09:54,496 --> 00:09:56,096
Are you still in Ningjiang Internet café?

236
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,856
I know you don't want to.

237
00:09:57,856 --> 00:09:59,656
But we won't be honored.

238
00:09:59,656 --> 00:10:00,457
It's ours.

239
00:10:00,457 --> 00:10:01,736
Others can't take it away.

240
00:10:01,736 --> 00:10:02,337
It's not ours.

241
00:10:02,337 --> 00:10:03,536
We don't want others to force us.

242
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,137
right or wrong?

243
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,296
Stop it.

244
00:10:06,296 --> 00:10:07,536
I can admit it.

245
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:10,736
Xiao Feng is the captain.

246
00:10:11,056 --> 00:10:13,457
We should have listened to him about the team.

247
00:10:13,777 --> 00:10:15,577
But Xiao Feng, have you ever thought about

248
00:10:15,817 --> 00:10:18,017
This matter concerns the future of all of us.

249
00:10:19,217 --> 00:10:20,736
Can you think about it?

250
00:10:48,377 --> 00:10:49,496
Can we start now?

251
00:10:54,296 --> 00:10:55,736
Ming, can you stop shaking?

252
00:10:55,976 --> 00:10:57,096
You're like a top.

253
00:10:57,096 --> 00:10:58,537
You make me dizzy.

254
00:11:06,856 --> 00:11:08,136
They're coming out.

255
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:13,016
How is it?

256
00:11:13,457 --> 00:11:14,817
Let's go back and wait.

257
00:11:15,057 --> 00:11:16,217
What are you waiting for?

258
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:17,657
Waiting for the penalty result.

259
00:11:17,856 --> 00:11:19,057
We'll wait for a week.

260
00:11:19,577 --> 00:11:21,016
Did they say

261
00:11:21,016 --> 00:11:22,457
It's usually like this.

262
00:11:22,577 --> 00:11:24,297
How will you be punished?

263
00:11:24,457 --> 00:11:26,217
Disqualification from the National Challenge.

264
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:27,616
The whole team is permanently banned.

265
00:11:27,776 --> 00:11:28,937
This is the worst.

266
00:11:39,496 --> 00:11:40,577
How is the procedure?

267
00:11:40,776 --> 00:11:41,896
It went well.

268
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:43,856
And assigned a single room.

269
00:11:45,016 --> 00:11:46,177
When my grandmother went there,

270
00:11:46,376 --> 00:11:47,896
You're very popular with the old man.

271
00:11:47,896 --> 00:11:48,736
Several old men

272
00:11:48,736 --> 00:11:50,057
To get her WeChat.

273
00:11:50,217 --> 00:11:51,297
She said she wanted to be her dance partner.

274
00:11:52,457 --> 00:11:53,537
What about your parents?

275
00:11:54,736 --> 00:11:55,297
The day after tomorrow.

276
00:11:58,896 --> 00:12:00,776
But the good news is I'm staying.

277
00:12:06,177 --> 00:12:07,256
Sure, Cheng Hao.

278
00:12:07,496 --> 00:12:09,297
Finally did a reliable thing.

279
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,976
What Cheng Hao really wants to do

280
00:12:12,976 --> 00:12:14,136
Has never failed.

281
00:12:14,856 --> 00:12:15,577
Brother Hao.

282
00:12:15,976 --> 00:12:17,217
I have to thank you for this.

283
00:12:20,136 --> 00:12:20,736
Thank you

284
00:12:22,057 --> 00:12:23,217
You're brothers. Don't mention it.

285
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,776
Didn't you say you wanted me to come?

286
00:12:26,457 --> 00:12:26,976
Correct!

287
00:12:27,896 --> 00:12:28,937
Call you here.

288
00:12:29,297 --> 00:12:31,016
I want to take you to join the fun.

289
00:12:31,177 --> 00:12:38,057
Come on, Yang Ting.

290
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:39,697
What is she?

291
00:12:39,817 --> 00:12:42,177
A transfer student wants to represent our school.

292
00:12:42,616 --> 00:12:43,616
Too big for her skin

293
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:45,057
Chuge, come on.

294
00:12:45,376 --> 00:12:47,096
Chuge is the champion.

295
00:12:48,256 --> 00:12:50,297
Chuge is the champion.

296
00:12:50,297 --> 00:12:51,937
Chuge, come on.

297
00:12:52,136 --> 00:12:53,896
Chuge is the champion.

298
00:12:53,896 --> 00:12:55,217
Chuge, come on.

299
00:12:55,217 --> 00:12:56,976
Who's number five?

300
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,177
Why are you looking at me with your nostrils?

301
00:12:58,337 --> 00:12:59,457
I'll turn her into a frog.

302
00:12:59,577 --> 00:13:00,736
That's Yang Ting.

303
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:02,256
The captain of the school sports team.

304
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:03,376
Her father

305
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,657
Is the leader of the sports bureau.

306
00:13:04,657 --> 00:13:05,577
What's wrong?

307
00:13:05,976 --> 00:13:07,096
Her father can't run for her.

308
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:08,976
The coach often gives her a special treatment.

309
00:13:09,537 --> 00:13:11,057
The school's women's sprint record

310
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:12,417
She kept it.

311
00:13:14,457 --> 00:13:15,337
Get set

312
00:13:17,537 --> 00:13:21,016
Chuge, come on.

313
00:13:21,016 --> 00:13:22,417
Number Six, get a false alarm.

314
00:13:22,577 --> 00:13:23,217
Go back

315
00:13:23,457 --> 00:13:24,856
Chu Ge didn't steal the race.

316
00:13:24,856 --> 00:13:26,217
The referee has poor eyesight.

317
00:13:26,217 --> 00:13:26,856
shoot!

318
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:28,856
You will be disqualified if you are warned twice.

319
00:13:29,136 --> 00:13:30,096
If Chuge starts running again,

320
00:13:30,096 --> 00:13:31,177
I will definitely keep some.

321
00:13:31,297 --> 00:13:32,337
It's too bad.

322
00:13:32,496 --> 00:13:33,417
On your marks

323
00:13:33,577 --> 00:13:35,376
It's obvious to let Yang Ting take the first place.

324
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:36,896
You want to rob me?

325
00:13:37,297 --> 00:13:38,217
You will lose.

326
00:13:40,376 --> 00:13:41,136
Get set

327
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:53,537
Chuge, come on.

328
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:55,616
Chuge, come on.

329
00:14:00,177 --> 00:14:01,697
Chuge, come on.

330
00:14:12,577 --> 00:14:13,537
Drink some water.

331
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,057
Congratulations.

332
00:14:24,256 --> 00:14:25,376
And won the second place.

333
00:14:25,376 --> 00:14:26,896
Go away. It's none of your business.

334
00:14:29,297 --> 00:14:29,896
Yes?

335
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,537
A disabled person in a wheelchair.

336
00:14:31,896 --> 00:14:32,937
To stand up for her.

337
00:14:34,057 --> 00:14:35,096
I'm doing it for your own good.

338
00:14:35,297 --> 00:14:36,376
Chuge is a transfer student.

339
00:14:36,937 --> 00:14:37,736
He was badly beaten.

340
00:14:37,736 --> 00:14:38,976
And sent back to the original school.

341
00:14:39,177 --> 00:14:40,016
But you are different.

342
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,337
You are the key student of the whole school.

343
00:14:42,657 --> 00:14:44,177
If he is punished,

344
00:14:45,096 --> 00:14:46,496
But the previous efforts will be wasted.

345
00:14:47,736 --> 00:14:49,096
I'll see who dares to touch my friend.

346
00:14:50,976 --> 00:14:51,616
In my opinion,

347
00:14:51,776 --> 00:14:52,616
Who dares to move?

348
00:14:52,817 --> 00:14:53,457
My cousin.

349
00:14:53,577 --> 00:14:55,016
Who dares to touch my own sister?

350
00:14:55,016 --> 00:14:55,896
Turn you into a frog.

351
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:56,616
In my opinion,

352
00:14:57,937 --> 00:14:58,616
Who dares to move?

353
00:15:01,136 --> 00:15:02,136
To win the championship.

354
00:15:02,577 --> 00:15:03,896
I think you should go back and dream.

355
00:15:04,856 --> 00:15:05,457
You wait.

356
00:15:05,457 --> 00:15:06,297
I'm not waiting.

357
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:08,256
If you refuse to accept it,

358
00:15:08,256 --> 00:15:09,256
Do you want to do it?

359
00:15:09,417 --> 00:15:10,016
You choose.

360
00:15:16,537 --> 00:15:18,337
Cousin, you won the championship.

361
00:15:22,577 --> 00:15:24,217
Chuge won the championship.

362
00:15:24,217 --> 00:15:25,256
We won the game.

363
00:15:25,256 --> 00:15:26,297
I have to celebrate.

364
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:27,177
Two happy events come one after the other

365
00:15:27,537 --> 00:15:28,776
Yeah, where are you going?

366
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:29,896
Who has a good idea?

367
00:15:30,337 --> 00:15:31,657
How about the amusement park?

368
00:15:32,136 --> 00:15:32,697
theme park

369
00:15:32,976 --> 00:15:33,817
Raise your hand if you agree.

370
00:15:41,376 --> 00:15:42,817
Take me to the amusement park.

371
00:15:43,177 --> 00:15:44,297
Do you think it's appropriate?

372
00:16:09,616 --> 00:16:10,976
Sure, Brother Zha.

373
00:16:45,136 --> 00:16:45,976
Look.

374
00:16:50,616 --> 00:16:51,616
I heard that

375
00:16:51,817 --> 00:16:53,976
If the sun

376
00:16:54,136 --> 00:16:56,217
The moment we fell, we made a wish.

377
00:16:56,457 --> 00:16:58,256
And when the sun comes up tomorrow,

378
00:16:58,376 --> 00:16:59,537
Your wish will come true.

379
00:17:00,856 --> 00:17:01,697
Su Jiayi.

380
00:17:02,096 --> 00:17:03,577
This chicken soup for the little girl.

381
00:17:03,577 --> 00:17:04,256
You believe that?

382
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:04,976
What's up

383
00:17:05,337 --> 00:17:06,297
I believe it.

384
00:17:06,937 --> 00:17:07,776
I believe that too.

385
00:17:08,537 --> 00:17:09,417
Count me in.

386
00:17:12,537 --> 00:17:13,896
What's your wish?

387
00:17:15,657 --> 00:17:16,417
Nezha, protection deity

388
00:17:17,856 --> 00:17:18,697
Get rich

389
00:17:19,096 --> 00:17:20,736
It's so cheesy.

390
00:17:21,177 --> 00:17:22,016
My wish.

391
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:25,376
I know a lot of beautiful girlfriends.

392
00:17:26,136 --> 00:17:27,496
You're more secular than her.

393
00:17:27,736 --> 00:17:28,817
Then tell me something good.

394
00:17:30,697 --> 00:17:31,817
I want to be the best.

395
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,376
Crossing the Fire professional e-sports player.

396
00:17:33,616 --> 00:17:34,297
It's not bad.

397
00:17:35,136 --> 00:17:35,856
Chu song

398
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:37,057
What about you?

399
00:17:41,537 --> 00:17:42,337
Southern body.

400
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,016
Your dream.

401
00:17:45,537 --> 00:17:47,776
Things that seem impossible

402
00:17:47,976 --> 00:17:48,817
It's a wish.

403
00:17:49,217 --> 00:17:50,937
Such as immortality.

404
00:17:51,256 --> 00:17:52,217
For example, Hao,

405
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:53,736
I want to find a lot of girlfriends.

406
00:17:57,016 --> 00:17:57,896
Lu Xiao Bei,

407
00:17:57,896 --> 00:18:01,136
I curse you to dream of me every night.

408
00:18:02,337 --> 00:18:03,016
Lu Xiao Bei,

409
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,577
What's your wish?

410
00:18:04,776 --> 00:18:05,697
You don't have to ask.

411
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:07,177
Of course, Hundred Cities is qualified.

412
00:18:07,376 --> 00:18:09,937
And get the world championship.

413
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:12,577
I hope

414
00:18:13,256 --> 00:18:15,376
Your wishes come true.

415
00:18:16,577 --> 00:18:17,136
great

416
00:18:18,616 --> 00:18:19,976
Let's go and eat.

417
00:18:20,297 --> 00:18:20,976
Lu Xiao Bei,

418
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:21,616
Wait for me.

419
00:18:21,937 --> 00:18:23,177
Don't leave me.

420
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,337
It has nothing to do with you.

421
00:19:00,337 --> 00:19:01,136
To tear down your wall.

422
00:19:01,136 --> 00:19:02,217
Or your yard?

423
00:19:02,217 --> 00:19:02,817
Bye

424
00:19:06,177 --> 00:19:06,697
feed

425
00:19:07,457 --> 00:19:09,417
What do you mean?

426
00:19:09,417 --> 00:19:10,496
What circle?

427
00:19:10,697 --> 00:19:11,577
Do you have a circle?

428
00:19:11,697 --> 00:19:13,457
I'll give you a wreath if you don't believe me.

429
00:19:15,736 --> 00:19:17,496
We are cheating. What's wrong?

430
00:19:17,817 --> 00:19:18,937
Believe it or not, if you talk nonsense,

431
00:19:18,937 --> 00:19:20,096
I will rip your mouth off.

432
00:19:20,496 --> 00:19:21,136
And scolded you.

433
00:19:21,136 --> 00:19:22,096
What's wrong?

434
00:19:22,297 --> 00:19:23,457
If you have the ability, cut me with a knife.

435
00:19:23,776 --> 00:19:24,616
Xiao Feng.

436
00:19:25,776 --> 00:19:26,856
What's going on?

437
00:19:27,096 --> 00:19:28,657
Why did Chen Rong know what you were talking about?

438
00:19:28,896 --> 00:19:29,576
That day,

439
00:19:29,697 --> 00:19:31,016
And came back to get my phone.

440
00:19:31,177 --> 00:19:32,056
Cellphones /Mobile Phones

441
00:19:32,857 --> 00:19:33,496
Finished

442
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:34,776
Was recorded.

443
00:19:34,937 --> 00:19:35,857
Was recorded.

444
00:19:41,496 --> 00:19:42,697
It's so lively this time.

445
00:19:42,736 --> 00:19:44,496
The Steel Coin Team asked someone to dig up the black material.

446
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:45,576
The semi-finals.

447
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,056
They're cheating.

448
00:19:47,056 --> 00:19:48,336
Someone found out.

449
00:19:48,336 --> 00:19:49,256
A bunch of loser.

450
00:19:49,336 --> 00:19:50,496
This is a national newspaper.

451
00:19:50,617 --> 00:19:51,617
Those bastards of the Gangen Army.

452
00:19:51,617 --> 00:19:53,296
This time, our Ning Jiang player's face

453
00:19:53,296 --> 00:19:54,016
All of them.

454
00:20:00,256 --> 00:20:01,137
They're here.

455
00:20:05,697 --> 00:20:06,576
There's no machine.

456
00:20:06,657 --> 00:20:07,897
Go to other people's houses.

457
00:20:08,296 --> 00:20:09,496
There must be a machine inside.

458
00:20:09,937 --> 00:20:10,657
Someone has decided.

459
00:20:10,736 --> 00:20:12,016
Are you afraid that we won't pay?

460
00:20:12,457 --> 00:20:13,336
It's not about money.

461
00:20:13,617 --> 00:20:14,457
Boss said

462
00:20:14,457 --> 00:20:15,256
Your team cheated.

463
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:15,976
Open it.

464
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:16,976
I won't let you board the plane.

465
00:20:17,056 --> 00:20:18,816
He asked us to stay two days ago.

466
00:20:18,816 --> 00:20:20,617
Why did you turn your back on him now?

467
00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:22,937
It has nothing to do with you.

468
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:24,336
Don't you have money?

469
00:20:24,336 --> 00:20:25,097
That's enough.

470
00:20:25,097 --> 00:20:25,736
What's wrong with you?

471
00:20:26,256 --> 00:20:26,657
Let's go.

472
00:20:26,657 --> 00:20:27,816
I'm working for someone.

473
00:20:27,816 --> 00:20:28,897
Why are you making things difficult for me?

474
00:20:32,776 --> 00:20:33,776
It's okay.

475
00:20:39,256 --> 00:20:39,897
Boss

476
00:20:40,137 --> 00:20:41,016
We have an appointment with the team.

477
00:20:41,016 --> 00:20:41,857
I'll leave after training.

478
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:44,776
You're all like this. Why are you here?

479
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:45,816
Go to another internet café.

480
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:50,736
Alright

481
00:20:50,736 --> 00:20:51,617
Don't make trouble for me.

482
00:20:53,217 --> 00:20:53,857
Thanks.

483
00:20:57,496 --> 00:20:58,296
No need

484
00:20:58,496 --> 00:20:59,496
They said they couldn't come.

485
00:21:01,137 --> 00:21:01,816
why

486
00:21:01,937 --> 00:21:02,736
They said

487
00:21:02,736 --> 00:21:04,377
You don't want to play with the team.

488
00:21:07,377 --> 00:21:08,617
Let's go. Don't play.

489
00:21:09,097 --> 00:21:09,937
Despondency

490
00:21:20,816 --> 00:21:22,177
How do you know everything?

491
00:21:22,536 --> 00:21:24,617
Bad news has wings

492
00:21:24,937 --> 00:21:25,897
That's normal.

493
00:21:26,056 --> 00:21:27,617
Why don't they come?

494
00:21:28,137 --> 00:21:29,056
I'm doing it now. They're going.

495
00:21:29,457 --> 00:21:30,816
Come back.

496
00:21:31,336 --> 00:21:33,016
You can only make it worse.

497
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:34,177
Are you really going to do something?

498
00:21:34,177 --> 00:21:35,137
The Match Committee will be punished more severely.

499
00:21:35,137 --> 00:21:36,296
We've stopped eating.

500
00:21:36,816 --> 00:21:37,857
What should we do?

501
00:21:38,536 --> 00:21:39,457
Bear it.

502
00:21:40,336 --> 00:21:41,937
This is what we should do.

503
00:21:42,536 --> 00:21:44,336
If you want to do great things, you must take responsibility first.

504
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,976
If the sky drops a knife, we must follow it.

505
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:48,377
When will the result come out?

506
00:21:49,177 --> 00:21:49,897
In a couple of days,

507
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,137
Lieutenant

508
00:21:54,457 --> 00:21:55,976
Let's go somewhere else to practice.

509
00:21:56,897 --> 00:21:58,937
The whole thing is my fault.

510
00:21:59,937 --> 00:22:01,336
I'm the one who harmed everyone.

511
00:22:02,736 --> 00:22:03,697
Not Captain.

512
00:22:05,256 --> 00:22:05,816
Lieutenant

513
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:06,857
I'm the one who harmed everyone.

514
00:22:06,857 --> 00:22:07,417
Lieutenant

515
00:22:08,056 --> 00:22:08,816
Lieutenant

516
00:22:46,776 --> 00:22:47,857
Do you know

517
00:22:48,937 --> 00:22:50,697
When I was young, I'm very greedy.

518
00:22:52,256 --> 00:22:53,536
One time, my classmates

519
00:22:53,536 --> 00:22:54,897
Take out a piece of food.

520
00:22:55,496 --> 00:22:57,256
He said his father brought it back from abroad.

521
00:22:57,256 --> 00:22:58,496
Champagne chocolate.

522
00:22:58,776 --> 00:22:59,897
I took a look.

523
00:23:00,736 --> 00:23:02,177
It's really champagne.

524
00:23:02,377 --> 00:23:03,177
Soft

525
00:23:03,937 --> 00:23:05,496
I really wanted to eat it.

526
00:23:06,377 --> 00:23:07,776
But he wouldn't give it to me.

527
00:23:07,937 --> 00:23:09,576
Then we quarreled.

528
00:23:10,137 --> 00:23:11,217
And got beaten badly.

529
00:23:11,217 --> 00:23:12,897
To get the chocolate.

530
00:23:14,776 --> 00:23:16,097
After you get it,

531
00:23:16,657 --> 00:23:17,937
I found the taste.

532
00:23:17,937 --> 00:23:19,937
Is not as beautiful as I imagined.

533
00:23:22,137 --> 00:23:23,496
People always do a lot of things

534
00:23:23,496 --> 00:23:24,857
And regret,

535
00:23:24,857 --> 00:23:25,937
To grow up.

536
00:23:27,377 --> 00:23:28,296
That's right.

537
00:23:33,857 --> 00:23:35,217
Many people

538
00:23:35,217 --> 00:23:36,937
What you really need,

539
00:23:37,937 --> 00:23:40,217
You will get a lot of things you don't want.

540
00:23:42,857 --> 00:23:43,657
that

541
00:23:45,976 --> 00:23:46,816
Find yourself.

542
00:23:46,816 --> 00:23:48,457
What you really need?

543
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:51,056
I don't know.

544
00:23:52,137 --> 00:23:52,816
What about you?

545
00:23:54,617 --> 00:23:55,816
What I need now

546
00:23:55,937 --> 00:23:57,177
Is to let you

547
00:23:57,177 --> 00:23:58,417
Hurry up. Pull yourself together.

548
00:23:58,576 --> 00:23:59,417
Especially you.

549
00:24:04,657 --> 00:24:05,496
AnLuan

550
00:24:06,056 --> 00:24:07,857
Have you had a boyfriend before?

551
00:24:11,496 --> 00:24:13,097
Why are you asking this question?

552
00:24:14,897 --> 00:24:16,097
At least one of the team

553
00:24:16,336 --> 00:24:17,897
Get to know each other.

554
00:24:20,617 --> 00:24:21,217
No

555
00:24:21,576 --> 00:24:23,576
Have you ever liked someone?

556
00:24:25,296 --> 00:24:25,976
No

557
00:24:29,137 --> 00:24:30,536
The first one doesn't look real.

558
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:33,496
The second one is a little reluctant.

559
00:24:40,976 --> 00:24:42,137
If one day,

560
00:24:42,617 --> 00:24:44,097
Xiao Feng is gone.

561
00:24:45,097 --> 00:24:46,657
Will you still stay?

562
00:24:50,617 --> 00:24:51,457
let it be

563
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:52,897
I'll give you a hard time.

564
00:24:53,097 --> 00:24:53,937
Forget it.

565
00:24:54,857 --> 00:24:55,697
What about you?

566
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,217
If one day,

567
00:24:58,217 --> 00:24:59,816
Xiao Feng left the Steel Coin Team.

568
00:25:00,377 --> 00:25:01,576
Will you still stay?

569
00:25:04,137 --> 00:25:04,857
Meeting

570
00:25:15,377 --> 00:25:16,296
Is it delicious?

571
00:25:16,897 --> 00:25:17,617
Yummy

572
00:25:19,617 --> 00:25:20,496
Let's go.

573
00:25:20,897 --> 00:25:22,056
Everyone is waiting for you.

574
00:25:26,736 --> 00:25:27,417
Get ready

575
00:25:30,536 --> 00:25:31,256
YangTing

576
00:25:31,776 --> 00:25:32,536
I've found out

577
00:25:32,816 --> 00:25:33,976
You guessed right.

578
00:25:34,137 --> 00:25:34,937
The girl of Chu Ge

579
00:25:34,937 --> 00:25:35,937
You're really something.

580
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:38,336
Tell me about it.

581
00:25:39,976 --> 00:25:41,897
The song of Chu.

582
00:25:42,097 --> 00:25:44,256
I heard a very interesting story recently.

583
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,536
Do you want to hear it?

584
00:25:45,897 --> 00:25:46,776
I'm busy.

585
00:25:47,016 --> 00:25:48,697
Eleven years ago, a man

586
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:50,097
Killed someone on Ning'an Road.

587
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:51,937
Then the police wanted to catch him.

588
00:25:52,457 --> 00:25:54,377
He jumped and died.

589
00:25:54,976 --> 00:25:56,776
He's dead. Don't care about anything.

590
00:25:57,776 --> 00:25:59,536
But he has a daughter who lives a miserable life.

591
00:26:00,536 --> 00:26:01,296
Her mother brought her

592
00:26:01,296 --> 00:26:02,976
Remarried to a vegetable seller.

593
00:26:03,217 --> 00:26:03,976
And what about her?

594
00:26:04,177 --> 00:26:05,457
Transfer from school to school.

595
00:26:06,377 --> 00:26:07,736
I'm afraid of being known.

596
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:08,657
My own father.

597
00:26:08,657 --> 00:26:09,937
Is a murderer.

598
00:26:14,536 --> 00:26:15,296
What do you want to do

599
00:26:15,816 --> 00:26:16,776
What do I want?

600
00:26:17,016 --> 00:26:17,857
It's simple.

601
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:19,937
Apologize to me first.

602
00:26:20,657 --> 00:26:22,137
And get out of our school.

603
00:26:23,736 --> 00:26:24,816
Or I'll ask everyone

604
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:25,897
Knows about you.

605
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:27,736
Including the one in the wheelchair.

606
00:26:29,536 --> 00:26:30,417
I'm warning you.

607
00:26:30,657 --> 00:26:32,457
You better tell me everything you know

608
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:33,296
Is rotting in my stomach.

609
00:26:33,536 --> 00:26:35,016
Or I will make you regret it.

610
00:26:35,617 --> 00:26:36,697
Do you understand me?

611
00:27:04,937 --> 00:27:06,256
Aren't you training today?

612
00:27:07,976 --> 00:27:08,816
Take a rest today.

613
00:27:09,657 --> 00:27:10,937
You should relax once in a while.

614
00:27:12,177 --> 00:27:12,976
What's wrong?

615
00:27:13,457 --> 00:27:14,496
You're acting weird today.

616
00:27:15,296 --> 00:27:16,097
No.

617
00:27:16,776 --> 00:27:18,417
I might have run five kilometers,

618
00:27:18,736 --> 00:27:19,496
I'm tired.

619
00:27:20,496 --> 00:27:20,976
Correct!

620
00:27:21,536 --> 00:27:23,657
I heard you're good at fighting.

621
00:27:24,016 --> 00:27:25,056
It's possible to pass the test.

622
00:27:26,377 --> 00:27:26,976
yes

623
00:27:28,056 --> 00:27:29,296
But even if we pass the test,

624
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:30,976
There is also a semi-professional league.

625
00:27:31,256 --> 00:27:32,296
And the Crossing Fire Professional League.

626
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:33,776
I'm far from my goal.

627
00:27:34,496 --> 00:27:35,816
There's still a long way to go.

628
00:27:39,377 --> 00:27:40,336
Let me ask you something.

629
00:27:41,417 --> 00:27:44,417
You said it was for your brother.

630
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:45,657
What about yourself?

631
00:27:46,137 --> 00:27:47,697
To escape from reality?

632
00:27:51,177 --> 00:27:52,097
Not exactly.

633
00:27:52,617 --> 00:27:54,137
When Cheng Hao's parents divorced,

634
00:27:54,576 --> 00:27:55,976
He was sad and lonely.

635
00:27:57,417 --> 00:27:59,217
We played games every day that summer.

636
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:00,816
later

637
00:28:01,937 --> 00:28:02,976
I was in a car accident.

638
00:28:03,377 --> 00:28:04,137
My leg is broken.

639
00:28:04,937 --> 00:28:06,056
And you're in a bad mood.

640
00:28:06,776 --> 00:28:08,016
And play games every day.

641
00:28:08,496 --> 00:28:09,697
He fought all day and night.

642
00:28:11,576 --> 00:28:13,417
But the game will be completed one day.

643
00:28:14,897 --> 00:28:15,697
And we

644
00:28:17,177 --> 00:28:18,657
You have to face the reality sooner or later.

645
00:28:23,776 --> 00:28:24,697
So,

646
00:28:25,217 --> 00:28:25,857
game

647
00:28:26,217 --> 00:28:27,617
And ostrich.

648
00:28:27,617 --> 00:28:28,617
There's no difference.

649
00:28:30,056 --> 00:28:30,736
Really?

650
00:28:34,217 --> 00:28:35,336
I don't think so.

651
00:28:35,857 --> 00:28:36,697
You know,

652
00:28:36,857 --> 00:28:38,496
What is the greatest fun of playing games?

653
00:28:39,576 --> 00:28:41,217
You knew you would fail.

654
00:28:41,857 --> 00:28:43,256
But I keep trying.

655
00:28:43,736 --> 00:28:45,016
It's like running a hundred meters.

656
00:28:45,377 --> 00:28:46,336
Even with bare feet,

657
00:28:46,736 --> 00:28:47,897
Even if someone stops you,

658
00:28:48,016 --> 00:28:49,736
You are still sprinting hard.

659
00:28:50,857 --> 00:28:51,937
The game taught me

660
00:28:52,657 --> 00:28:53,736
To do the right thing.

661
00:28:54,657 --> 00:28:55,897
Instead of something easy.

662
00:28:57,857 --> 00:28:58,457
Lu Xiao Bei,

663
00:29:00,457 --> 00:29:01,336
I'm going back.

664
00:29:14,937 --> 00:29:15,697
What's wrong?

665
00:29:17,697 --> 00:29:18,496
see you tomorrow

666
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,137
You scared me.

667
00:29:21,816 --> 00:29:23,617
I thought you wanted to confess your love to me.

668
00:29:25,256 --> 00:29:26,137
Go back now.

669
00:29:26,776 --> 00:29:27,816
Don't forget to do your homework.

670
00:29:45,137 --> 00:29:50,496
Would you be friends with a murderer's daughter?

671
00:29:52,937 --> 00:29:55,576
I don't want to play with my life.

672
00:29:55,576 --> 00:29:56,736
We are ordinary people.

673
00:29:56,736 --> 00:29:57,736
I can understand her.

674
00:29:57,736 --> 00:29:58,657
You can pity her.

675
00:29:58,657 --> 00:30:00,377
But I won't be with her.

676
00:30:00,377 --> 00:30:01,056
Are you crazy?

677
00:30:01,056 --> 00:30:02,256
Contact with this kind of girl,

678
00:30:02,256 --> 00:30:03,177
I won't.

679
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:04,137
You can't make friends.

680
00:30:04,417 --> 00:30:06,816
I wouldn't have interacted with such a person.

681
00:30:07,137 --> 00:30:07,937
Cold-blooded genes

682
00:30:07,937 --> 00:30:09,256
Is genetic.

683
00:30:24,296 --> 00:30:25,417
Have you seen it?

684
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:26,336
I saw it.

685
00:30:26,976 --> 00:30:27,657
It's so horrible.

686
00:30:27,657 --> 00:30:28,857
And her photo.

687
00:30:28,857 --> 00:30:29,976
What are you looking at?

688
00:30:29,976 --> 00:30:30,937
This is Chu Ge.

689
00:30:30,937 --> 00:30:32,016
Have you seen our school's post?

690
00:30:32,016 --> 00:30:33,457
Is someone talking about Chuge?

691
00:30:33,536 --> 00:30:35,056
I don't know who posted it.

692
00:30:35,056 --> 00:30:37,056
Chuge's father is a murderer.

693
00:30:37,976 --> 00:30:39,897
Her father is a murderer and she is not.

694
00:30:40,056 --> 00:30:41,496
You're looking at people with colored glasses.

695
00:30:41,496 --> 00:30:42,217
Is wrong.

696
00:30:42,377 --> 00:30:43,336
Haven't you heard of it?

697
00:30:43,336 --> 00:30:44,937
Can cold-blooded genes be inherited?

698
00:30:45,897 --> 00:30:46,697
I'm coming.

699
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:00,576
The murderer's daughter.

700
00:31:00,576 --> 00:31:02,256
He must not be a good person.

701
00:31:02,697 --> 00:31:03,697
Her father didn't pay back the debts.

702
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:05,736
Why does No.1 High School accept such people?

703
00:31:06,056 --> 00:31:06,897
The murderer's daughter.

704
00:31:06,897 --> 00:31:08,016
Stay away from her.

705
00:31:09,137 --> 00:31:10,897
How can you transfer to our school?

706
00:31:10,897 --> 00:31:12,137
How can our school accept her?

707
00:31:13,016 --> 00:31:13,816
Haven't you heard of it?

708
00:31:13,816 --> 00:31:14,897
Can cold-blooded genes be inherited?

709
00:31:14,897 --> 00:31:16,097
Stay away from her.

710
00:31:21,536 --> 00:31:23,217
Chuge, what are you doing? Go to class.

711
00:31:23,496 --> 00:31:24,256
Chu song

712
00:31:30,336 --> 00:31:31,056
Where is Yang Ting?

713
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,336
Seems to be in the dressing room.

714
00:31:35,816 --> 00:31:36,697
Have you seen Yang Ting?

715
00:31:37,217 --> 00:31:37,617
No

716
00:31:41,576 --> 00:31:42,576
What's wrong?

717
00:32:08,937 --> 00:32:09,857
how could that be?

718
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:15,937
We ran into each other.

719
00:32:17,016 --> 00:32:17,617
Kill him.

720
00:32:18,016 --> 00:32:18,536
Kill him.

721
00:32:19,496 --> 00:32:21,776
King's hands are really hot.

722
00:32:22,336 --> 00:32:23,177
wow

723
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:25,137
This is so cool.

724
00:32:25,857 --> 00:32:26,897
Everyone, listen to me.

725
00:32:27,457 --> 00:32:29,617
The cultivator is now 22 points.

726
00:32:29,617 --> 00:32:31,336
Next battle is Langya League.

727
00:32:31,336 --> 00:32:33,056
If you win, it's 23 points.

728
00:32:33,177 --> 00:32:34,816
The Langya League has 21 points.

729
00:32:34,976 --> 00:32:36,336
Our team is now 20 points.

730
00:32:36,697 --> 00:32:38,056
If we can win the last game,

731
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:38,937
It's 21 points.

732
00:32:39,097 --> 00:32:40,217
The same as the Langya Alliance.

733
00:32:40,336 --> 00:32:41,137
If so,

734
00:32:41,137 --> 00:32:42,937
We can rely on the winning relationship.

735
00:32:43,097 --> 00:32:43,976
Kick the wolf tooth.

736
00:32:43,976 --> 00:32:46,217
Promoted to semi-professional league as the second in the group.

737
00:32:48,256 --> 00:32:49,576
What is the winning and losing relationship?

738
00:32:49,736 --> 00:32:51,536
Didn't we win Langya last time?

739
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:52,657
The winning and losing relationship

740
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:54,496
If the two teams are in the same division,

741
00:32:54,496 --> 00:32:56,496
In the previous match,

742
00:32:58,736 --> 00:32:59,736
The power of the cultivator

743
00:32:59,736 --> 00:33:01,496
Is much better than the Langya League.

744
00:33:01,816 --> 00:33:03,417
In this form,

745
00:33:03,897 --> 00:33:04,976
Take care of them.

746
00:33:05,296 --> 00:33:07,016
You can enter the city ahead of time.

747
00:33:07,016 --> 00:33:07,736
first

748
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:08,496
We still have to take down

749
00:33:08,496 --> 00:33:09,657
The last game.

750
00:33:09,897 --> 00:33:11,056
BK has always been at the bottom.

751
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:12,897
I don't think there's any suspense.

752
00:33:12,976 --> 00:33:13,657
such

753
00:33:13,897 --> 00:33:15,657
Let's relax tonight.

754
00:33:16,056 --> 00:33:17,056
My treat.

755
00:33:17,296 --> 00:33:18,536
The celebration banquet in advance.

756
00:33:19,256 --> 00:33:20,496
Forget it.

757
00:33:20,697 --> 00:33:23,056
Last time, we were invited to eat seafood.

758
00:33:23,056 --> 00:33:23,857
The result is...

759
00:33:23,857 --> 00:33:26,016
A box of octopus balls.

760
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:27,177
I think

761
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:29,336
We're still more reliable in ordering takeout today.

762
00:33:31,296 --> 00:33:32,457
Leaders, don't worry.

763
00:33:32,697 --> 00:33:34,177
This time, I will definitely make the arrangement.

764
00:33:34,177 --> 00:33:35,097
There must be noodles.

765
00:33:35,816 --> 00:33:36,457
Xiaobei

766
00:33:36,897 --> 00:33:37,816
Call Chu Ge.

767
00:33:38,576 --> 00:33:39,697
She has training today.

768
00:33:39,697 --> 00:33:40,897
After her training,

769
00:33:40,897 --> 00:33:41,857
How late is it? We are waiting for her.

770
00:33:41,857 --> 00:33:42,336
Well

771
00:33:42,336 --> 00:33:43,056
a row

772
00:33:43,056 --> 00:33:46,776
All kinds of difficulties can't stop me.

773
00:33:46,776 --> 00:33:48,296
Use your brain.

774
00:33:48,296 --> 00:33:50,657
Think of a way.

775
00:33:50,657 --> 00:33:56,097
You can succeed if you believe in yourself.

776
00:33:56,816 --> 00:33:58,097
Fly the sky freely.

777
00:33:58,097 --> 00:33:58,857
It's a crash.

778
00:33:58,857 --> 00:33:59,897
It snores.

779
00:33:59,976 --> 00:34:00,617
Stop

780
00:34:02,056 --> 00:34:02,937
Stop.

781
00:34:03,576 --> 00:34:04,336
The singer.

782
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:05,137
Sleeping

783
00:34:05,457 --> 00:34:06,697
Stop playing.

784
00:34:10,177 --> 00:34:12,377
I'm Cheng Hao.

785
00:34:12,736 --> 00:34:13,897
To say a few words.

786
00:34:14,857 --> 00:34:16,097
You can talk.

787
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:19,177
Dry the wine first. Hurry up.

788
00:34:20,097 --> 00:34:20,617
drink

789
00:34:21,536 --> 00:34:22,976
Is this still Cheng Hao?

790
00:34:22,976 --> 00:34:23,736
Drinking again?

791
00:34:23,736 --> 00:34:25,336
He asked us to sing again.

792
00:34:25,576 --> 00:34:26,736
Come on, Cheng Hao.

793
00:34:27,536 --> 00:34:28,697
Open your

794
00:34:29,576 --> 00:34:30,897
The award is wrong.

795
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,336
Drinking Testimonials

796
00:34:38,137 --> 00:34:40,417
I hate it. There's no speech.

797
00:34:40,857 --> 00:34:41,897
Only thanks.

798
00:34:43,776 --> 00:34:44,937
I want to thank Su Jiayi.

799
00:34:46,937 --> 00:34:47,736
Thank you.

800
00:34:48,736 --> 00:34:50,336
Thank you for scolding me.

801
00:34:50,857 --> 00:34:51,736
And tickled me.

802
00:34:52,536 --> 00:34:53,897
Tickling me hurts so much.

803
00:34:55,056 --> 00:34:56,976
What else is there to be cynical about?

804
00:34:56,976 --> 00:34:57,736
Black me.

805
00:34:58,177 --> 00:34:59,056
But,

806
00:34:59,336 --> 00:35:00,736
And let me know.

807
00:35:02,097 --> 00:35:02,937
I'm really sorry.

808
00:35:16,377 --> 00:35:17,336
Brother Kai.

809
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:20,617
Thank you.

810
00:35:21,296 --> 00:35:23,137
Thank you for beating me in the game.

811
00:35:23,617 --> 00:35:25,016
To teach me in life.

812
00:35:26,697 --> 00:35:28,016
To wake up in time.

813
00:35:29,016 --> 00:35:30,137
I know myself.

814
00:35:31,097 --> 00:35:31,776
not good

815
00:35:48,417 --> 00:35:49,097
Hit me.

816
00:35:53,617 --> 00:35:54,816
Brother Zha.

817
00:35:56,097 --> 00:35:57,256
Thank you.

818
00:35:57,417 --> 00:35:58,576
It's you who let me know.

819
00:35:58,857 --> 00:35:59,937
Besides Lu Xiaobai,

820
00:36:00,377 --> 00:36:01,617
I have a partner.

821
00:36:02,417 --> 00:36:05,256
And one who can practice with me every day.

822
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:07,256
No matter how bad I am,

823
00:36:07,377 --> 00:36:08,776
You took the trouble to accompany me.

824
00:36:20,097 --> 00:36:21,137
This wine is too

825
00:36:22,256 --> 00:36:23,097
It's too strong.

826
00:36:25,377 --> 00:36:28,496
Xiao Bei. Little North.

827
00:36:31,897 --> 00:36:33,296
My north.

828
00:36:43,177 --> 00:36:44,137
Thank you.

829
00:36:45,376 --> 00:36:46,217
Thank you.

830
00:36:47,617 --> 00:36:49,137
The most difficult time for the team,

831
00:36:50,336 --> 00:36:51,776
You didn't kick me out.

832
00:36:57,977 --> 00:36:59,097
That's enough.

833
00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:02,137
Don't drink it.

834
00:37:06,256 --> 00:37:07,577
Sit down.

835
00:37:11,416 --> 00:37:13,296
You drank too much and got drunk.

836
00:37:13,776 --> 00:37:14,856
Who will pay the bill?

837
00:37:28,697 --> 00:37:29,577
Where is Cheng Hao?

838
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:31,537
He's a rich second generation.

839
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:34,537
My parents only know how to give me money.

840
00:37:34,617 --> 00:37:35,856
So I have many friends.

841
00:37:36,416 --> 00:37:38,097
But as long as I stop,

842
00:37:38,977 --> 00:37:40,617
Those people, they all ran away.

843
00:37:41,936 --> 00:37:42,856
They all ran away.

844
00:37:43,256 --> 00:37:45,497
Are false friends.

845
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:48,456
When my dad and mom got divorced,

846
00:37:50,776 --> 00:37:51,816
Too scared.

847
00:37:53,217 --> 00:37:54,416
I'm scared of someone.

848
00:37:54,697 --> 00:37:56,296
I'm sleeping at home alone.

849
00:37:57,217 --> 00:37:58,896
I kept the light on.

850
00:37:59,776 --> 00:38:00,816
Only Xiao Bei

851
00:38:01,856 --> 00:38:02,657
Xiaobei

852
00:38:07,217 --> 00:38:08,537
Stay with me day and night.

853
00:38:10,296 --> 00:38:10,977
Stay with me.

854
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:12,977
So,

855
00:38:13,936 --> 00:38:15,057
I know in my heart,

856
00:38:16,057 --> 00:38:17,456
I only have one family.

857
00:38:22,816 --> 00:38:23,977
But it's different now.

858
00:38:24,097 --> 00:38:26,936
One, two, three.

859
00:38:27,416 --> 00:38:29,617
I have three more families now.

860
00:38:31,097 --> 00:38:31,776
wrong

861
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:32,856
And Chuge, right?

862
00:38:33,057 --> 00:38:34,017
And Chuge.

863
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:35,617
One, two, three.

864
00:38:35,617 --> 00:38:37,057
I have five families.

865
00:38:39,137 --> 00:38:40,416
I have five families.

866
00:38:44,896 --> 00:38:46,177
I'm so happy.

867
00:38:47,097 --> 00:38:48,097
I'm really happy.

868
00:38:48,896 --> 00:38:49,776
I'm very happy

869
00:38:53,657 --> 00:38:54,416
Stop drinking.

870
00:38:55,697 --> 00:38:56,896
Be a man.

871
00:38:56,896 --> 00:38:58,177
Happiness is the most important.

872
00:38:58,577 --> 00:39:00,697
The most important thing is to be happy.

873
00:39:00,856 --> 00:39:02,097
But you let me know

874
00:39:02,936 --> 00:39:04,177
You should have an ideal.

875
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,657
It's really important to have dreams.

876
00:39:07,217 --> 00:39:08,537
It's really good to have a dream.

877
00:39:08,896 --> 00:39:09,736
It's great.

878
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:12,336
You can play tricks in games.

879
00:39:12,336 --> 00:39:13,256
And play well.

880
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,896
Why is it that playing games is not proper?

881
00:39:15,977 --> 00:39:18,057
You can play games and play the world champion, okay?

882
00:39:38,497 --> 00:39:39,177
Xiaobei

883
00:39:41,776 --> 00:39:42,936
You care so much about the team.

884
00:39:44,456 --> 00:39:45,736
Why didn't you replace me?

885
00:39:46,416 --> 00:39:47,296
Are you stupid?

886
00:39:48,097 --> 00:39:49,296
How could it be?

887
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:53,896
How could I kick you out?

888
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:31,856
Lu Xiao Bei,

889
00:40:32,497 --> 00:40:34,697
I doubt if you have something on Cheng Hao.

890
00:40:34,896 --> 00:40:36,217
Why is he listening to you?

891
00:40:36,657 --> 00:40:37,816
I have his naked photo.

892
00:40:38,017 --> 00:40:39,177
HD, no code.

893
00:40:42,137 --> 00:40:43,977
You didn't wear pants that day, okay?

894
00:40:44,097 --> 00:40:44,856
You even said that

895
00:40:45,736 --> 00:40:46,697
You know what?

896
00:40:46,896 --> 00:40:48,736
The first day of kindergarten,

897
00:40:49,057 --> 00:40:50,217
And jumped into the pool.

898
00:40:50,456 --> 00:40:51,376
What are you doing?

899
00:40:51,856 --> 00:40:52,617
Catch a golden fish.

900
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:53,177
Yes

901
00:40:53,177 --> 00:40:54,497
Then we took off our pants.

902
00:40:54,497 --> 00:40:56,376
Turn around the yard.

903
00:40:56,376 --> 00:40:57,977
Everyone took photos of us with their phones.

904
00:40:57,977 --> 00:40:58,537
then

905
00:40:58,617 --> 00:41:00,217
The teacher gave us a nickname.

906
00:41:00,296 --> 00:41:00,896
call

907
00:41:00,896 --> 00:41:02,416
Brother Hale.

908
00:41:04,736 --> 00:41:08,057
Who are you?

909
00:41:08,217 --> 00:41:09,177
Are all naked.

910
00:41:09,177 --> 00:41:10,456
Where are the pants?

911
00:41:11,057 --> 00:41:11,977
I'm wearing two pairs of trousers.

912
00:41:11,977 --> 00:41:12,736
One blue, one yellow.

913
00:41:14,336 --> 00:41:15,416
Neuropathy

914
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:19,657
That's it.

915
00:41:20,456 --> 00:41:21,376
The speech is over.

916
00:41:21,537 --> 00:41:22,977
The next step is love.

917
00:41:23,137 --> 00:41:24,057
In order to continue the team,

918
00:41:24,057 --> 00:41:24,816
Come on

919
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:25,856
And wins.

920
00:41:25,856 --> 00:41:28,697
And wins.

921
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:47,816
Hello, hello.

922
00:41:49,816 --> 00:41:50,296
It's me.

923
00:41:51,776 --> 00:41:52,856
Did you contact Chu Ge?

924
00:41:54,816 --> 00:41:55,497
what

925
00:41:57,977 --> 00:41:59,097
The school.

926
00:42:00,177 --> 00:42:01,256
Okay, let's see.
