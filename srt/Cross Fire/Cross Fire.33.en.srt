1
00:02:17,692 --> 00:02:18,733
Come in and have a seat.

2
00:02:20,092 --> 00:02:20,932
You're alone.

3
00:02:21,973 --> 00:02:22,693
You live here?

4
00:02:25,693 --> 00:02:27,092
Although I'm lonely,

5
00:02:27,652 --> 00:02:28,772
But I'm used to it.

6
00:02:30,772 --> 00:02:31,772
What would you like to drink?

7
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:33,652
Give it back.

8
00:02:33,652 --> 00:02:34,853
Do you like yogurt?

9
00:03:21,893 --> 00:03:22,492
what are you doing?

10
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:23,893
Do you have any paper?

11
00:03:23,893 --> 00:03:24,372
Lend me some.

12
00:03:24,693 --> 00:03:25,772
This is so ordinary.

13
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:26,732
Do you have a pattern?

14
00:03:27,372 --> 00:03:29,012
This is unique. I'll give it to you.

15
00:03:52,693 --> 00:03:54,333
This is the last time Lu Xiao Bei

16
00:03:55,372 --> 00:03:56,613
It was given to me at the company.

17
00:03:58,012 --> 00:03:59,173
You gave this to me.

18
00:04:23,773 --> 00:04:25,052
Stop frowning.

19
00:04:27,572 --> 00:04:28,413
after

20
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:32,773
Stop frowning.

21
00:05:01,693 --> 00:05:02,933
This is the destiny I want.

22
00:05:03,253 --> 00:05:04,452
I'll wait for you at the door.

23
00:05:04,452 --> 00:05:05,373
You must come.

24
00:05:05,693 --> 00:05:06,852
As long as you come back,

25
00:05:06,852 --> 00:05:08,292
I've made yogurt for you all your life.

26
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:23,572
You only played once.

27
00:05:24,052 --> 00:05:25,052
Why are you still in love with

28
00:05:25,172 --> 00:05:26,172
I don't know either

29
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,332
I think it's probably just an intuition.

30
00:05:35,332 --> 00:05:37,332
Don't hit me. Stop.

31
00:05:37,332 --> 00:05:39,093
Only fighting can solve the problem?

32
00:05:39,093 --> 00:05:40,253
Didn't I do it to save you?

33
00:05:41,172 --> 00:05:41,732
There are cockroaches.

34
00:05:44,572 --> 00:05:45,612
What's the principle?

35
00:05:57,693 --> 00:05:58,732
I really...

36
00:06:02,172 --> 00:06:02,892
I miss you.

37
00:08:07,172 --> 00:08:08,052
Xiao Feng.

38
00:08:11,812 --> 00:08:12,653
Xiao Feng.

39
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,133
Xiao Feng.

40
00:08:19,172 --> 00:08:19,732
Xiao Feng.

41
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,093
Xiao Feng.

42
00:08:34,893 --> 00:08:35,773
Where have you been?

43
00:08:36,052 --> 00:08:37,812
I'm going to buy you breakfast.

44
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:38,852
When I got up in the morning,

45
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,573
I want to make you breakfast.

46
00:08:40,573 --> 00:08:41,812
But when I used your stove,

47
00:08:42,413 --> 00:08:43,932
The thief can't use it.

48
00:08:43,932 --> 00:08:44,973
I'll buy it for you.

49
00:08:44,973 --> 00:08:46,573
I found your door is more advanced.

50
00:08:46,812 --> 00:08:47,653
It's better than the stove.

51
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:47,932
more

52
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,213
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

53
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:51,893
I don't know how to use that password.

54
00:08:51,893 --> 00:08:53,413
What password?

55
00:08:57,732 --> 00:09:00,172
You just recovered. You can't run around.

56
00:09:00,612 --> 00:09:02,013
We can order takeout later.

57
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:04,893
I can eat and drink now.

58
00:09:04,893 --> 00:09:05,852
You're in good condition.

59
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,773
If you have a problem, don't force yourself.

60
00:09:10,213 --> 00:09:10,732
If you need it,

61
00:09:10,732 --> 00:09:12,093
I can take you to see a psychiatrist.

62
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:13,333
Psychiatrist

63
00:09:13,893 --> 00:09:15,172
I'm in such good condition.

64
00:09:15,172 --> 00:09:16,333
I also saw a psychiatrist.

65
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,732
Now I can tell a psychologist is sick.

66
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:19,533
Do you believe that?

67
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,133
I want to find a job.

68
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:24,413
You can't eat and drink all day.

69
00:09:24,893 --> 00:09:25,692
Don't worry.

70
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:27,692
After you have a good rest,

71
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,013
Let's find a job, okay?

72
00:09:31,013 --> 00:09:31,292
not good

73
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:34,932
I've been lying for so long.

74
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:36,852
If I don't move,

75
00:09:36,852 --> 00:09:38,292
I feel I'm rusty everywhere.

76
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:42,372
We have a long-term cooperation company.

77
00:09:42,653 --> 00:09:44,093
It's looking for an operations manager.

78
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:45,893
I can recommend you there.

79
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:46,893
Mainly responsible for

80
00:09:46,893 --> 00:09:48,573
The specific work of the tournament operation.

81
00:09:50,052 --> 00:09:50,612
I'll think about it.

82
00:09:50,612 --> 00:09:51,732
Don't think about it.

83
00:09:51,732 --> 00:09:52,932
I know their boss very well.

84
00:09:53,172 --> 00:09:54,533
Because of you.

85
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:55,372
I have to think about it.

86
00:09:56,093 --> 00:09:57,773
I can't go there to drag you down.

87
00:09:58,852 --> 00:10:00,612
They have the training.

88
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,973
I will tell you in advance.

89
00:10:02,973 --> 00:10:04,093
Give you time to adjust.

90
00:10:07,653 --> 00:10:08,333
Forget it.

91
00:10:08,932 --> 00:10:09,893
I own a few kilos.

92
00:10:09,893 --> 00:10:10,692
I know.

93
00:10:11,372 --> 00:10:12,612
I can't do this job.

94
00:10:15,372 --> 00:10:16,773
It doesn't matter if you don't work for a while.

95
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,052
I raised you.

96
00:10:19,692 --> 00:10:20,413
What do you want?

97
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:21,492
I'm not a pet.

98
00:10:22,692 --> 00:10:23,932
I have my own hands and feet.

99
00:10:23,932 --> 00:10:24,773
And brain.

100
00:10:24,893 --> 00:10:25,413
Are you hungry?

101
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:27,172
You...

102
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:35,333
Are you really not going to

103
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,893
Back to the e-sports circle?

104
00:10:38,252 --> 00:10:40,653
This industry is developing at a high speed.

105
00:10:41,212 --> 00:10:42,572
Whether it's an e-sports player,

106
00:10:42,572 --> 00:10:43,972
Or an e-sports manager?

107
00:10:44,332 --> 00:10:45,092
It's actually

108
00:10:45,092 --> 00:10:46,292
And the prospect is very good.

109
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:48,613
AnLuan

110
00:10:49,812 --> 00:10:50,653
You should know that

111
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:52,452
Back then,

112
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:53,692
No salary.

113
00:10:53,932 --> 00:10:54,812
And no job.

114
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:57,373
Now the bonus for professionals is so high.

115
00:10:57,733 --> 00:10:59,133
I'm really happy for them.

116
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,413
It means that

117
00:11:01,932 --> 00:11:02,972
I didn't pay for nothing.

118
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:03,812
right or wrong?

119
00:11:05,853 --> 00:11:06,292
I also know

120
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:08,013
The e-sports industry is developing so well.

121
00:11:09,773 --> 00:11:10,332
but

122
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:13,853
I might not be able to adapt.

123
00:11:16,932 --> 00:11:18,452
I can't even hold the mouse.

124
00:11:18,932 --> 00:11:19,692
let it be

125
00:11:22,332 --> 00:11:24,253
Things have changed a lot over the years.

126
00:11:25,653 --> 00:11:26,373
But there are many.

127
00:11:26,373 --> 00:11:27,893
The core hasn't changed.

128
00:11:28,972 --> 00:11:30,733
I think adapting to the current situation of the industry

129
00:11:30,972 --> 00:11:32,133
It's not a problem for you.

130
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:38,853
Hold on.

131
00:11:39,212 --> 00:11:39,733
What's wrong with you?

132
00:11:40,572 --> 00:11:41,292
What's wrong with you?

133
00:11:41,893 --> 00:11:42,413
I have a headache.

134
00:11:42,613 --> 00:11:43,932
Why would you have a sudden headache?

135
00:11:44,373 --> 00:11:45,572
Let's go to the hospital, Xiao Feng.

136
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:46,212
No need

137
00:11:46,893 --> 00:11:47,373
may

138
00:11:47,893 --> 00:11:48,773
Maybe because

139
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:50,413
You talk too much.

140
00:11:57,773 --> 00:11:59,092
Before you make a decision,

141
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:01,413
Are you sure you don't want to ask it first?

142
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:09,572
I'm asking you.

143
00:12:11,853 --> 00:12:12,332
He said no.

144
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:16,972
You're really sick.

145
00:12:17,092 --> 00:12:17,773
I'm not sick.

146
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:24,972
Sorry

147
00:12:24,972 --> 00:12:25,773
Our team

148
00:12:25,773 --> 00:12:26,613
Is preparing for war now.

149
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:27,932
May not be promoted.

150
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:30,133
Hold on. I'll answer the phone.

151
00:12:32,572 --> 00:12:33,853
Leader Chu, come here.

152
00:12:34,893 --> 00:12:35,452
come

153
00:12:36,212 --> 00:12:37,052
Leader Chu.

154
00:12:37,052 --> 00:12:37,812
Hold on. I'll be ready soon.

155
00:12:37,812 --> 00:12:38,212
fast

156
00:12:38,212 --> 00:12:38,653
I

157
00:12:38,653 --> 00:12:39,253
Take a photo first.

158
00:12:39,253 --> 00:12:40,052
to pose

159
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:40,572
Lu Xiao Bei,

160
00:12:40,572 --> 00:12:41,013
good

161
00:12:41,013 --> 00:12:41,292
Take a photo.

162
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:41,972
Take a group photo.

163
00:12:43,332 --> 00:12:44,533
Three, two.

164
00:12:44,692 --> 00:12:45,932
Is Chuge fat?

165
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,332
fat

166
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:50,253
This Singapore competition

167
00:12:50,253 --> 00:12:50,972
In your hearts,

168
00:12:50,972 --> 00:12:52,373
Did you set any targets?

169
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:55,172
Let's go to Singapore this time.

170
00:12:55,172 --> 00:12:56,332
sure

171
00:12:56,332 --> 00:12:57,413
You can't leave empty-handed.

172
00:12:57,572 --> 00:12:58,092
Yes

173
00:12:58,212 --> 00:13:00,172
Our team represents the country.

174
00:13:00,172 --> 00:13:00,893
China

175
00:13:00,893 --> 00:13:01,653
therefore

176
00:13:01,653 --> 00:13:03,052
We must win honor for our country.

177
00:13:03,052 --> 00:13:03,653
I want to be

178
00:13:03,653 --> 00:13:05,452
The first woman to win the world championship.

179
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:05,893
Yes

180
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:07,413
Must be the champion.

181
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:09,773
We won't be able to go back if we're the runner-up.

182
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:10,932
I can't lose him.

183
00:13:11,092 --> 00:13:12,452
We want to keep winning.

184
00:13:12,452 --> 00:13:13,413
To win the world championship.

185
00:13:14,092 --> 00:13:15,052
Captain, what about you?

186
00:13:16,092 --> 00:13:17,613
The cattle were blown by them.

187
00:13:17,812 --> 00:13:18,972
Then my goal

188
00:13:18,972 --> 00:13:20,692
Is to help them achieve their goals.

189
00:13:21,493 --> 00:13:23,253
I can hear you're determined.

190
00:13:23,373 --> 00:13:24,572
During this period,

191
00:13:24,572 --> 00:13:26,332
Have you prepared for the competition?

192
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:27,332
actually

193
00:13:27,692 --> 00:13:29,452
We're in the offseason.

194
00:13:29,773 --> 00:13:30,212
However

195
00:13:30,212 --> 00:13:31,893
We are about to start training.

196
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:33,133
immediately

197
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:34,932
We are also going to fight with a team from Vietnam.

198
00:13:34,932 --> 00:13:35,653
To play a warm-up match.

199
00:13:36,092 --> 00:13:37,613
I look forward to seeing you in Singapore.

200
00:13:37,613 --> 00:13:39,212
To achieve a good result.

201
00:13:39,212 --> 00:13:40,812
After all, China Crossfire Team

202
00:13:40,812 --> 00:13:41,893
And become the world champion.

203
00:13:42,092 --> 00:13:43,893
It's been two or three years.

204
00:13:43,893 --> 00:13:45,212
Of course, I also noticed that

205
00:13:45,212 --> 00:13:45,893
I've been treating you

206
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:47,452
There are some voices of doubt.

207
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:49,413
I think your team is too young.

208
00:13:49,812 --> 00:13:51,172
Lack of international competition experience.

209
00:13:51,172 --> 00:13:52,052
Even thought that

210
00:13:52,052 --> 00:13:53,773
You can't represent Chinese e-sports.

211
00:13:54,212 --> 00:13:54,733
This is

212
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:55,853
Do you want to respond?

213
00:14:00,052 --> 00:14:00,812
we

214
00:14:01,653 --> 00:14:03,613
Is a team from Hundred Cities.

215
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:06,413
At that time,

216
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:07,613
No one believes it.

217
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:08,773
We can hit a hundred cities.

218
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:10,373
But now,

219
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:11,733
We've already taken

220
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:12,932
The champion of Crossfire Professional League.

221
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:15,133
I always believe in one thing.

222
00:14:17,212 --> 00:14:18,572
When no one trusts you,

223
00:14:19,653 --> 00:14:20,653
You believe in yourself.

224
00:14:20,653 --> 00:14:21,932
And won the victory.

225
00:14:23,013 --> 00:14:23,452
this

226
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,172
Is the way to be a hero.

227
00:14:28,413 --> 00:14:29,653
We are indeed

228
00:14:30,332 --> 00:14:31,452
A very young team.

229
00:14:32,332 --> 00:14:33,493
But it's also our advantage.

230
00:14:34,692 --> 00:14:35,613
The responsibility now

231
00:14:36,212 --> 00:14:37,533
Has fallen on our shoulders.

232
00:14:38,332 --> 00:14:39,692
We have to believe in ourselves.

233
00:14:39,972 --> 00:14:41,013
I will do my best.

234
00:14:41,253 --> 00:14:42,653
No matter how it ends,

235
00:14:43,893 --> 00:14:44,812
Just try your best.

236
00:14:50,172 --> 00:14:51,253
Everyone is here.

237
00:14:51,373 --> 00:14:52,413
To introduce to you.

238
00:14:52,653 --> 00:14:53,413
These people

239
00:14:53,413 --> 00:14:54,613
Is a new member of our team.

240
00:14:54,812 --> 00:14:55,452
this

241
00:14:55,452 --> 00:14:57,253
Is our Technical Support Specialist Allen.

242
00:14:57,253 --> 00:14:57,692
after

243
00:14:57,692 --> 00:14:59,613
To analyze the data of our competitions and training.

244
00:14:59,812 --> 00:15:01,812
Hello, everyone. I'm promoting Yu.

245
00:15:01,812 --> 00:15:02,893
Nice to meet you all.

246
00:15:02,893 --> 00:15:03,452
Hello, everyone.

247
00:15:03,452 --> 00:15:04,692
I'm the assistant of Leader Chu.

248
00:15:04,692 --> 00:15:05,853
Everyone can call me Jiang Jiang.

249
00:15:05,853 --> 00:15:07,373
I'm a business marketing junior.

250
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,172
In charge of strategic business.

251
00:15:10,092 --> 00:15:10,812
And this one.

252
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:12,452
Is our life service officer.

253
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:12,932
Miss Liu,

254
00:15:12,932 --> 00:15:13,972
What do you need?

255
00:15:13,972 --> 00:15:15,133
You can mention it to Liu.

256
00:15:15,493 --> 00:15:16,733
What do you want to eat today?

257
00:15:17,332 --> 00:15:18,292
I'm greedy for dumplings.

258
00:15:18,413 --> 00:15:19,613
Make some dumplings for everyone.

259
00:15:19,613 --> 00:15:20,972
I want beef and cabbage filling.

260
00:15:21,493 --> 00:15:22,773
I want to eat pork, three kinds of fresh.

261
00:15:22,893 --> 00:15:23,773
Okay, no problem.

262
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:24,692
Miss Liu,

263
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:25,572
If the dumplings are ready,

264
00:15:25,572 --> 00:15:26,413
You can cook it early.

265
00:15:26,613 --> 00:15:27,893
Our game will be quick.

266
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:29,932
You guys have been

267
00:15:29,932 --> 00:15:31,212
You're a little confident.

268
00:15:31,212 --> 00:15:31,733
Who did you learn it from?

269
00:15:34,572 --> 00:15:35,572
It has nothing to do with me.

270
00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:36,653
How many of you

271
00:15:36,653 --> 00:15:37,932
I'm telling you, if you win, you can have dumplings.

272
00:15:37,932 --> 00:15:39,013
Only the dumpling soup.

273
00:15:39,493 --> 00:15:40,092
Get ready.

274
00:15:40,092 --> 00:15:40,932
The competition will begin soon.

275
00:15:42,413 --> 00:15:42,932
Lesser Snow

276
00:15:42,932 --> 00:15:43,972
Take them to get familiar with the environment.

277
00:15:43,972 --> 00:15:44,733
Okay, let's go.

278
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:46,893
International events

279
00:15:47,092 --> 00:15:48,253
You are not allowed to bring your own communication device.

280
00:15:48,373 --> 00:15:49,493
But you can use this.

281
00:15:49,493 --> 00:15:50,853
A more sensitive headset.

282
00:15:51,292 --> 00:15:52,812
The mode is special for the competition.

283
00:15:53,413 --> 00:15:54,653
The language is English.

284
00:15:54,773 --> 00:15:55,613
firearms

285
00:15:55,613 --> 00:15:57,172
It's an unpainted light plate gun.

286
00:15:57,172 --> 00:15:58,253
Get used to it.

287
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:00,733
If you're ready,

288
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:01,533
We can start now.

289
00:16:01,773 --> 00:16:03,133
I heard that the Vietnamese team

290
00:16:03,452 --> 00:16:05,613
He's good at endgame.

291
00:16:05,972 --> 00:16:06,692
So, everyone,

292
00:16:06,692 --> 00:16:07,733
Don't take it lightly.

293
00:16:07,932 --> 00:16:08,493
Come on

294
00:16:09,373 --> 00:16:09,932
Come on.

295
00:16:12,893 --> 00:16:14,172
To start the game.

296
00:16:14,172 --> 00:16:14,733
Go for B.

297
00:16:16,013 --> 00:16:16,773
Be careful

298
00:16:16,773 --> 00:16:17,572
Kai, hold on to the B bridge.

299
00:16:17,572 --> 00:16:18,052
Received

300
00:16:18,052 --> 00:16:18,653
Point A is coming.

301
00:16:19,572 --> 00:16:20,613
A Road, clear one.

302
00:16:20,972 --> 00:16:21,692
Nice gun.

303
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:26,253
I'm going to help.

304
00:16:28,853 --> 00:16:29,932
pretty

305
00:16:29,932 --> 00:16:30,692
You played well.

306
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,212
Slow down.

307
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:39,853
Miss Liu,

308
00:16:39,853 --> 00:16:41,773
Prepare some seasoning for the dumplings.

309
00:16:41,773 --> 00:16:42,932
The game will be over soon.

310
00:16:55,332 --> 00:16:56,853
The dumplings are ready.

311
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:15,653
Babies, eat up.

312
00:17:15,653 --> 00:17:16,452
When it's hot,

313
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,253
It's too cold to taste good.

314
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:18,172
Hurry up, chopsticks.

315
00:17:18,172 --> 00:17:18,692
fast

316
00:17:29,572 --> 00:17:30,092
Nothing

317
00:17:30,653 --> 00:17:32,253
Failure is the mother of success.

318
00:17:32,812 --> 00:17:34,253
Besides, this is a warm-up match.

319
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:35,493
Xiaobei

320
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:37,572
You're acting weird today.

321
00:17:38,052 --> 00:17:38,773
Usual

322
00:17:39,052 --> 00:17:40,733
Don't you always get more excited after losing?

323
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:41,172
yes

324
00:17:41,613 --> 00:17:43,733
It's indeed a good thing to be disappointed before the competition.

325
00:17:44,493 --> 00:17:46,332
You just lost a warm-up match.

326
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:47,212
It's okay.

327
00:17:47,212 --> 00:17:48,733
Everyone hasn't trained for more than half a month.

328
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:50,253
You need to find your status slowly.

329
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,172
But today is not about the condition.

330
00:17:53,253 --> 00:17:54,773
Actually, everyone played well today.

331
00:17:55,212 --> 00:17:56,533
They are so lucky.

332
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,332
They are determined to fight the endgame.

333
00:17:58,332 --> 00:17:59,533
Is very experienced.

334
00:17:59,932 --> 00:18:01,092
Actually, the Vietnamese team

335
00:18:01,092 --> 00:18:02,052
Everyone has seen the video.

336
00:18:02,052 --> 00:18:03,092
Over the past six months,

337
00:18:03,092 --> 00:18:04,653
The strength of the Vietnamese team has increased a lot.

338
00:18:04,653 --> 00:18:05,413
Because they invited

339
00:18:05,413 --> 00:18:07,133
Former World Esports Championship Champion

340
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:07,972
Derek is the coach.

341
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,052
He's very experienced.

342
00:18:09,212 --> 00:18:10,092
Our team is now

343
00:18:10,653 --> 00:18:11,972
We need someone like him.

344
00:18:12,253 --> 00:18:13,253
Can be objective.

345
00:18:13,253 --> 00:18:14,653
For our training and competition,

346
00:18:14,653 --> 00:18:15,292
And give your opinion.

347
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:16,292
The critical moment.

348
00:18:17,253 --> 00:18:18,613
He can stand behind us.

349
00:18:19,052 --> 00:18:19,972
Do you have anyone?

350
00:18:27,572 --> 00:18:28,332
Sorry

351
00:18:28,332 --> 00:18:29,133
I'm late.

352
00:18:29,373 --> 00:18:29,972
Nothing

353
00:18:30,253 --> 00:18:31,013
I've just arrived.

354
00:18:36,932 --> 00:18:37,692
Be careful.

355
00:18:38,013 --> 00:18:38,533
Be careful

356
00:18:38,773 --> 00:18:39,493
Nothing

357
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:46,373
can

358
00:18:46,373 --> 00:18:47,092
This young man

359
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:48,733
A little something.

360
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:50,493
You know what they used to call me?

361
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:51,373
what

362
00:18:51,373 --> 00:18:52,493
Ningjiang C Luo.

363
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:54,653
I taught you when you were little.

364
00:18:57,092 --> 00:18:57,493
That's right.

365
00:19:00,092 --> 00:19:00,773
What about

366
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:02,773
Ning Jiang, teach me one more time.

367
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:03,533
You want to learn?

368
00:19:05,092 --> 00:19:05,613
go

369
00:19:12,053 --> 00:19:13,532
Watch your face. I'm telling you.

370
00:19:27,293 --> 00:19:27,893
come

371
00:19:41,373 --> 00:19:42,573
I haven't exercised for so many years.

372
00:19:42,853 --> 00:19:43,613
Or not.

373
00:19:44,573 --> 00:19:45,532
My mother.

374
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:46,133
Correct!

375
00:19:49,012 --> 00:19:50,012
How is Xu Wei?

376
00:19:51,853 --> 00:19:52,692
When he heard the news,

377
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:53,452
And ran away immediately.

378
00:19:53,772 --> 00:19:55,172
The police have issued an arrest warrant.

379
00:19:56,212 --> 00:19:56,853
Catch him!

380
00:19:58,252 --> 00:19:59,053
It's only a matter of time.

381
00:20:02,532 --> 00:20:04,293
I hope this day will come soon.

382
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:05,972
What about

383
00:20:06,853 --> 00:20:08,012
What's next?

384
00:20:09,452 --> 00:20:10,093
I

385
00:20:11,053 --> 00:20:12,413
I must be looking for a job.

386
00:20:12,932 --> 00:20:13,692
And support myself.

387
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:14,932
What job do you want?

388
00:20:16,373 --> 00:20:18,053
It depends on what kind of job you want.

389
00:20:24,212 --> 00:20:25,373
To be the coach of my team.

390
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:27,333
Our team

391
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,532
We always need one.

392
00:20:28,532 --> 00:20:30,133
A tactician like you can suppress the formation.

393
00:20:34,252 --> 00:20:36,172
My skills are out of date.

394
00:20:36,532 --> 00:20:38,252
I'm sure that

395
00:20:38,252 --> 00:20:39,093
I can't help you.

396
00:20:39,452 --> 00:20:40,373
I can only make things worse for you.

397
00:20:40,932 --> 00:20:41,732
impossible

398
00:20:41,732 --> 00:20:42,853
Although the internet speed is fast now,

399
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:43,932
The game version has been updated.

400
00:20:43,932 --> 00:20:45,172
But the game is still the same.

401
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:47,532
Your classic tactics

402
00:20:47,532 --> 00:20:48,732
Our team still uses it.

403
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:50,492
and

404
00:20:51,413 --> 00:20:52,732
Although all these years have passed,

405
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,093
You've always been

406
00:20:54,093 --> 00:20:55,373
The Legend of the Crossfire Player

407
00:20:55,373 --> 00:20:56,613
You heard that Seven's game account

408
00:20:56,613 --> 00:20:58,133
Will still be excited.

409
00:21:02,252 --> 00:21:03,452
Seven has long been offline.

410
00:21:04,452 --> 00:21:05,732
If they know now,

411
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:07,053
Seven is a WeChat...

412
00:21:07,053 --> 00:21:08,133
It's useless.

413
00:21:08,653 --> 00:21:09,853
Will be disappointed.

414
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:12,293
Aren't you Ning Jiang C?

415
00:21:12,893 --> 00:21:14,893
The Portuguese C Luo

416
00:21:15,053 --> 00:21:16,492
Won the Golden Globe Award in 2008.

417
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:16,972
up until now

418
00:21:16,972 --> 00:21:18,613
Still running on the track.

419
00:21:18,893 --> 00:21:19,853
You can't lose.

420
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:22,012
And trust me.

421
00:21:22,293 --> 00:21:23,252
Check it online.

422
00:21:23,732 --> 00:21:24,893
Seven is still

423
00:21:24,893 --> 00:21:26,413
The legend of all the players who crossed the line of fire.

424
00:21:30,932 --> 00:21:32,373
Let me live in the legend.

425
00:21:33,053 --> 00:21:34,053
It's good.

426
00:21:36,373 --> 00:21:37,653
Don't reject me.

427
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:39,172
Go to my team and have a look.

428
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:51,573
Go and have a look.

429
00:21:56,772 --> 00:21:57,492
Let's go.

430
00:22:00,772 --> 00:22:01,692
clothes

431
00:22:05,133 --> 00:22:06,333
I'm telling you, the team is great.

432
00:22:11,053 --> 00:22:12,093
This is our base.

433
00:22:12,653 --> 00:22:14,172
They are

434
00:22:14,172 --> 00:22:15,252
Should be training.

435
00:22:15,772 --> 00:22:16,893
Middle road

436
00:22:18,452 --> 00:22:19,093
Go inside.

437
00:22:19,093 --> 00:22:20,613
Amazing

438
00:22:20,853 --> 00:22:22,012
I'll seal the cigarette.

439
00:22:22,653 --> 00:22:23,452
I followed.

440
00:22:23,452 --> 00:22:24,333
Wang Kai, get the bag.

441
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:25,613
There are two more.

442
00:22:25,613 --> 00:22:26,133
I have a gun.

443
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:27,252
Stay under the bridge.

444
00:22:27,252 --> 00:22:28,252
There are people on the bridge.

445
00:22:28,252 --> 00:22:29,333
These are replacements.

446
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:30,252
Someone is coming from the middle road.

447
00:22:30,252 --> 00:22:30,853
I saw it.

448
00:22:30,853 --> 00:22:31,373
fall

449
00:22:31,373 --> 00:22:31,972
One from Warehouse B.

450
00:22:31,972 --> 00:22:32,653
pretty

451
00:22:32,653 --> 00:22:33,293
Amazing

452
00:22:33,293 --> 00:22:33,972
Watch B.

453
00:22:33,972 --> 00:22:34,573
I'm searching.

454
00:23:06,613 --> 00:23:07,333
There's one left.

455
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:08,492
Door B is here.

456
00:23:08,492 --> 00:23:09,413
Amazing

457
00:23:12,172 --> 00:23:12,893
Xiao Bei, come on.

458
00:23:15,212 --> 00:23:15,813
this

459
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:17,532
This is

460
00:23:19,492 --> 00:23:20,492
Seven? This isn't...

461
00:23:21,252 --> 00:23:21,813
Oh, my God.

462
00:23:22,452 --> 00:23:23,532
It's really you.

463
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,573
This is Cheng Hao of our team.

464
00:23:27,613 --> 00:23:27,813
Hello

465
00:23:27,813 --> 00:23:28,492
Su Jiayi.

466
00:23:28,813 --> 00:23:29,413
WangKai

467
00:23:29,613 --> 00:23:31,133
Nezha, Xiangzi.

468
00:23:31,573 --> 00:23:32,452
And this one.

469
00:23:32,653 --> 00:23:33,972
Is the leader of our team.

470
00:23:36,613 --> 00:23:37,532
You must be Chu Ge.

471
00:23:38,732 --> 00:23:39,413
hello

472
00:23:39,413 --> 00:23:41,212
I was President An's assistant.

473
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:43,053
I often heard her talking about your team.

474
00:23:43,212 --> 00:23:44,333
She didn't speak ill of me, right?

475
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:44,813
No

476
00:23:44,813 --> 00:23:45,972
When she was the leader,

477
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:47,333
I scolded her every day.

478
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:48,492
The times have changed.

479
00:23:48,653 --> 00:23:50,172
Only the leader scolds us every day.

480
00:23:50,492 --> 00:23:52,333
If you can be a great god, scold me.

481
00:23:53,293 --> 00:23:54,373
Who has a pen?

482
00:23:54,373 --> 00:23:56,093
I need an autograph from my idol.

483
00:23:56,093 --> 00:23:57,012
And me.

484
00:23:57,012 --> 00:23:58,373
I've watched you play since I was little.

485
00:23:58,373 --> 00:23:59,093
I really admire you.

486
00:23:59,093 --> 00:23:59,532
And me.

487
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,492
I dreamed about playing desert dust with you.

488
00:24:02,093 --> 00:24:02,893
But I didn't win once.

489
00:24:03,772 --> 00:24:04,573
Thank you

490
00:24:04,692 --> 00:24:06,212
This is our training room.

491
00:24:06,573 --> 00:24:08,532
That is our game room.

492
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:09,613
And we were just downstairs.

493
00:24:09,613 --> 00:24:10,492
And installed a gym.

494
00:24:10,932 --> 00:24:12,813
You can exercise if you're tired from the game.

495
00:24:13,492 --> 00:24:14,172
The conditions are great.

496
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:16,653
Back then, we didn't dare to think

497
00:24:17,532 --> 00:24:19,212
Our conditions are already hard.

498
00:24:19,413 --> 00:24:21,252
Brother Kirin just rented a new venue for us.

499
00:24:21,452 --> 00:24:22,373
More than 600 yuan.

500
00:24:22,373 --> 00:24:23,452
In a few months,

501
00:24:23,452 --> 00:24:24,492
We can move there.

502
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:26,853
Back then,

503
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:28,613
Where are you going?

504
00:24:28,613 --> 00:24:29,573
Where is the team?

505
00:24:30,972 --> 00:24:32,413
Times have really changed.

506
00:24:33,532 --> 00:24:34,613
Is your effort.

507
00:24:35,532 --> 00:24:36,532
Changed the times.

508
00:24:39,492 --> 00:24:41,532
I heard that you are a technical master.

509
00:24:41,532 --> 00:24:43,692
Please give us some advice.

510
00:24:44,972 --> 00:24:46,653
Your fight was good.

511
00:24:46,932 --> 00:24:48,532
It's better than your final performance.

512
00:24:48,692 --> 00:24:49,653
The day before yesterday,

513
00:24:49,653 --> 00:24:51,093
I played a warm-up match with Vietnam.

514
00:24:51,452 --> 00:24:52,653
We lost one to two.

515
00:24:53,012 --> 00:24:53,893
The Vietnamese team

516
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:55,172
We played against the Japanese team again.

517
00:24:55,613 --> 00:24:56,613
Lost zero to two.

518
00:24:57,133 --> 00:24:57,893
The second round.

519
00:24:58,212 --> 00:24:59,613
She was shaved.

520
00:24:59,972 --> 00:25:01,293
After the two rounds,

521
00:25:01,573 --> 00:25:02,772
Everyone thought

522
00:25:02,772 --> 00:25:04,212
We won't be able to pass the group.

523
00:25:05,573 --> 00:25:07,053
If you are not ready,

524
00:25:07,452 --> 00:25:08,413
You can find a reason.

525
00:25:08,413 --> 00:25:09,373
Not going to Singapore.

526
00:25:09,853 --> 00:25:11,413
You won the national championship anyway.

527
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,252
We want to win the world championship.

528
00:25:17,653 --> 00:25:18,492
How dare you!

529
00:25:20,573 --> 00:25:21,813
If a man wants to succeed,

530
00:25:22,692 --> 00:25:24,452
You must have some unrealistic confidence.

531
00:25:25,532 --> 00:25:26,613
You said it yourself.

532
00:25:29,853 --> 00:25:30,932
There are four weeks left.

533
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:33,212
Our team

534
00:25:34,172 --> 00:25:35,012
I really need one.

535
00:25:35,012 --> 00:25:36,172
A coach like you

536
00:25:48,893 --> 00:25:50,172
You went to Lu Xiao Bei's place?

537
00:25:51,692 --> 00:25:52,413
How do you know?

538
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:56,373
Cheng Hao posted the photo of you on the Internet.

539
00:25:56,373 --> 00:25:57,532
A lot of people forwarded it.

540
00:25:57,532 --> 00:25:59,252
That Seven is back.

541
00:25:59,732 --> 00:26:00,373
There are still people who guess you.

542
00:26:00,373 --> 00:26:01,972
I'm going to coach the Continuing Team.

543
00:26:03,293 --> 00:26:04,532
Put your feet down.

544
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:09,492
I want to help him.

545
00:26:10,492 --> 00:26:12,053
But I don't know what to do.

546
00:26:13,853 --> 00:26:15,972
The Japanese team is really good this year.

547
00:26:15,972 --> 00:26:17,012
And the warm-up match has been

548
00:26:17,012 --> 00:26:18,133
The runner-up last year

549
00:26:18,133 --> 00:26:19,373
Brazil won.

550
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:22,093
You should stay at home.

551
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:24,212
Are you thirsty?

552
00:26:26,972 --> 00:26:28,573
I knew I would lose so badly.

553
00:26:29,492 --> 00:26:31,012
He wants to be the champion of the world.

554
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:33,972
Actually, I always think

555
00:26:34,772 --> 00:26:36,853
Lu Xiao Bei has something.

556
00:26:37,853 --> 00:26:39,172
Is very similar to you back then.

557
00:26:41,212 --> 00:26:42,053
What's that

558
00:26:45,573 --> 00:26:47,093
Unreasonable courage.

559
00:26:48,532 --> 00:26:50,212
Because I love one thing,

560
00:26:51,093 --> 00:26:52,653
And rushed forward regardless of everything.

561
00:26:55,932 --> 00:26:56,413
Really?

562
00:27:06,573 --> 00:27:08,452
Should I cut my hair?

563
00:27:08,653 --> 00:27:09,452
Don't cut it.

564
00:27:09,692 --> 00:27:10,532
It's too long.

565
00:27:10,732 --> 00:27:12,333
This is the hair I have kept for 11 years.

566
00:27:12,853 --> 00:27:13,732
You can't cut it casually.

567
00:27:13,853 --> 00:27:14,853
I'm glad you like it.

568
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,333
The same length as you.

569
00:27:16,732 --> 00:27:17,452
No.

570
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:20,492
I've been thinking about

571
00:27:22,573 --> 00:27:23,172
Namely

572
00:27:24,293 --> 00:27:25,853
How do you turn on the TV?

573
00:27:28,093 --> 00:27:29,093
Why don't you have a remote control?

574
00:27:29,093 --> 00:27:29,853
Learn

575
00:27:30,413 --> 00:27:31,133
Modest Prosperity

576
00:27:32,212 --> 00:27:33,053
Turn on the TV.

577
00:27:36,212 --> 00:27:37,012
Who is Xiaokang?

578
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:38,853
It's TV.

579
00:27:45,053 --> 00:27:46,853
You want Xiao Kang to turn on the TV?

580
00:27:47,053 --> 00:27:47,932
Yes

581
00:27:48,932 --> 00:27:50,053
It's a comfortable life.

582
00:27:52,893 --> 00:27:54,532
So amazing?

583
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:57,813
Modest Prosperity

584
00:27:59,932 --> 00:28:00,573
Modest Prosperity

585
00:28:02,452 --> 00:28:03,293
Modest Prosperity

586
00:28:21,692 --> 00:28:22,492
What are you looking at?

587
00:28:24,212 --> 00:28:24,813
Thank you

588
00:28:25,492 --> 00:28:27,373
I'm studying the opponents of the World Super League.

589
00:28:31,093 --> 00:28:32,012
Is there any result?

590
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:34,012
I thought the Vietnamese team was strong enough.

591
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:35,692
I didn't expect the Japanese team to be so horrible.

592
00:28:35,692 --> 00:28:37,093
Can be said to be a perfect team.

593
00:28:37,653 --> 00:28:38,932
Especially their captain.

594
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:39,972
Machine

595
00:28:39,972 --> 00:28:41,293
This man lives up to his name.

596
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:43,772
Calm and steady.

597
00:28:44,613 --> 00:28:46,212
It's like a machine.

598
00:28:46,413 --> 00:28:47,613
I checked his condition.

599
00:28:48,053 --> 00:28:49,653
He's also a weirdo in reality.

600
00:28:49,653 --> 00:28:50,813
And barely spoke to anyone.

601
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:52,972
And never used social software.

602
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:54,653
The phone you've been using

603
00:28:55,053 --> 00:28:56,573
Or a straight button phone?

604
00:28:57,613 --> 00:28:59,813
Never use social software.

605
00:29:00,053 --> 00:29:01,333
But this is no time.

606
00:29:02,012 --> 00:29:03,293
I really don't know how he lives.

607
00:29:03,532 --> 00:29:04,333
and

608
00:29:05,413 --> 00:29:06,932
He seemed to have autism when he was young.

609
00:29:07,893 --> 00:29:09,293
Living in the hospital for a long time.

610
00:29:10,012 --> 00:29:11,413
Since learning to cross the line,

611
00:29:12,012 --> 00:29:13,932
Spent most of his time training.

612
00:29:14,293 --> 00:29:15,653
I often stayed up for several days.

613
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:18,133
no wonder

614
00:29:18,613 --> 00:29:20,333
The game is his whole life.

615
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:22,413
I've seen the video of his game.

616
00:29:22,813 --> 00:29:23,532
Seriously,

617
00:29:25,293 --> 00:29:26,813
He should be the one

618
00:29:28,212 --> 00:29:29,212
The strongest opponent I've ever encountered.

619
00:29:34,972 --> 00:29:37,012
If only Feng could be the coach.

620
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:40,972
I respect his choice.

621
00:29:45,972 --> 00:29:47,452
Take him on a vacation.

622
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,333
The Pacific Ocean is the best choice.

623
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:50,373
There's no time.

624
00:29:53,732 --> 00:29:54,813
Science proves that

625
00:29:54,813 --> 00:29:56,653
Endorphins are the first choice for stress reduction.

626
00:29:56,653 --> 00:29:57,772
But it's more efficient now.

627
00:29:57,772 --> 00:29:59,093
The way you release the endorphin

628
00:29:59,093 --> 00:30:00,172
It's just getting laid.

629
00:30:03,772 --> 00:30:04,893
This is not good.

630
00:30:05,613 --> 00:30:06,772
To confess to him.

631
00:30:07,093 --> 00:30:08,053
The power of love.

632
00:30:08,053 --> 00:30:09,532
Can overcome all troubles.

633
00:30:12,212 --> 00:30:12,893
What are you thinking?

634
00:30:14,172 --> 00:30:14,613
I

635
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:16,413
I didn't think of anything.

636
00:30:16,692 --> 00:30:18,853
I just want to call you out.

637
00:30:19,293 --> 00:30:20,813
Go for a walk.

638
00:30:21,932 --> 00:30:22,893
Don't.

639
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:24,813
I don't like outdoor.

640
00:30:27,413 --> 00:30:28,012
Correct!

641
00:30:28,012 --> 00:30:29,692
I heard that there's a movie coming.

642
00:30:29,692 --> 00:30:30,293
It's beautiful.

643
00:30:30,293 --> 00:30:31,133
Do you want to go there?

644
00:30:31,853 --> 00:30:33,053
My eyes are sore and I have no energy.

645
00:30:34,492 --> 00:30:36,373
If you really don't want to see it,

646
00:30:37,053 --> 00:30:38,012
Let's have some hot pot.

647
00:30:42,093 --> 00:30:42,893
You just finished eating.

648
00:30:44,893 --> 00:30:45,492
How about this?

649
00:30:46,133 --> 00:30:46,732
I

650
00:30:46,732 --> 00:30:47,813
I haven't run for a long time.

651
00:30:48,133 --> 00:30:49,732
Go running with me later.

652
00:30:50,093 --> 00:30:50,613
Alright?

653
00:30:53,172 --> 00:30:54,692
If you need help, just tell me.

654
00:30:55,492 --> 00:30:56,172
Wait a second.

655
00:30:57,093 --> 00:30:58,732
I just want you to be free for a while.

656
00:30:59,212 --> 00:31:00,093
Don't spend all day

657
00:31:00,093 --> 00:31:01,373
I'm thinking about the competition.

658
00:31:01,573 --> 00:31:03,573
No matter how strong the Japanese team is, our team is not weak.

659
00:31:03,573 --> 00:31:05,172
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

660
00:31:07,573 --> 00:31:08,333
Lu Xiao Bei,

661
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:09,813
Stop right there.

662
00:31:09,813 --> 00:31:10,813
I'm telling you,

663
00:31:10,813 --> 00:31:11,772
The person I like

664
00:31:11,772 --> 00:31:12,772
Wouldn't it be because

665
00:31:12,772 --> 00:31:13,813
And flinched at the least difficulty.

666
00:31:13,813 --> 00:31:14,452
His courage is

667
00:31:14,452 --> 00:31:15,613
Will never be shaken.

668
00:31:19,532 --> 00:31:20,532
What were you talking about?

669
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:22,053
I said,

670
00:31:22,492 --> 00:31:23,853
The courage never wavers.

671
00:31:24,093 --> 00:31:24,772
The last sentence,

672
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:26,772
I

673
00:31:30,893 --> 00:31:31,532
I didn't say that.

674
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:32,532
Did you say that?

675
00:31:35,932 --> 00:31:36,893
Are you telling me?

676
00:31:37,172 --> 00:31:38,093
I didn't say that.

677
00:31:38,093 --> 00:31:39,093
Did you say that?

678
00:31:39,853 --> 00:31:41,293
I said I liked you.

679
00:31:41,293 --> 00:31:42,053
Breaking the law

680
00:31:42,053 --> 00:31:42,813
Come down.

681
00:31:51,053 --> 00:31:51,653
Received

682
00:32:05,972 --> 00:32:07,653
A pretty girl alone.

683
00:32:07,653 --> 00:32:08,653
Do you want to run together?

684
00:32:08,772 --> 00:32:09,093
That's right.

685
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,732
It's better to sweat alone than three people.

686
00:32:10,732 --> 00:32:11,133
together

687
00:32:14,293 --> 00:32:15,732
Brother Niu.

688
00:32:16,172 --> 00:32:16,932
Where's Tiao?

689
00:32:18,053 --> 00:32:18,732
What are you looking for?

690
00:32:19,012 --> 00:32:19,893
Not that.

691
00:32:20,532 --> 00:32:22,573
Swimming and fitness.

692
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:24,293
Go away

693
00:32:30,492 --> 00:32:31,373
Did I scare you?

694
00:32:50,293 --> 00:32:51,972
Don't touch it. What if it's broken?

695
00:32:52,373 --> 00:32:54,413
How can it be broken?

696
00:32:54,413 --> 00:32:55,012
You don't want people to try it.

697
00:32:55,012 --> 00:32:55,653
Nothing

698
00:32:56,252 --> 00:32:57,373
Look at him.

699
00:32:57,373 --> 00:32:58,333
Can he play it?

700
00:32:59,653 --> 00:33:00,212
go

701
00:33:40,692 --> 00:33:41,653
Everyone,

702
00:33:41,932 --> 00:33:43,972
Where did they win?

703
00:33:43,972 --> 00:33:45,093
The gun is too strong.

704
00:33:45,093 --> 00:33:46,692
All of them follow the outside.

705
00:33:47,772 --> 00:33:49,532
Their killing average is horrible.

706
00:33:49,532 --> 00:33:50,532
Is much taller than us.

707
00:33:50,532 --> 00:33:50,972
I think they

708
00:33:50,972 --> 00:33:52,413
It's not as amazing as you said.

709
00:33:52,813 --> 00:33:54,373
But their spy is really good.

710
00:33:54,373 --> 00:33:55,893
The key is that they are too steady.

711
00:33:56,172 --> 00:33:57,053
There's no mistake.

712
00:33:57,293 --> 00:33:57,853
Kai

713
00:33:58,333 --> 00:33:58,932
What do you think

714
00:34:00,012 --> 00:34:01,413
The biggest feeling I have after watching it.

715
00:34:01,813 --> 00:34:02,653
Is their style of play.

716
00:34:02,653 --> 00:34:03,613
It's so targeted.

717
00:34:03,613 --> 00:34:04,532
Almost every time,

718
00:34:04,813 --> 00:34:06,133
I won it by the neck.

719
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,653
If we are against them,

720
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:09,373
The odds are not good.

721
00:34:09,373 --> 00:34:10,172
Dear Route Team,

722
00:34:10,573 --> 00:34:12,333
Can't you say something encouraging?

723
00:34:13,653 --> 00:34:15,573
He played very hard at the beginning.

724
00:34:15,813 --> 00:34:16,932
Then drag the rhythm.

725
00:34:17,252 --> 00:34:18,613
Let the opponent fall into their pit.

726
00:34:19,053 --> 00:34:19,653
Xiaobei

727
00:34:20,212 --> 00:34:22,012
Don't you think this tactic is very familiar?

728
00:34:22,653 --> 00:34:23,532
I know this.

729
00:34:25,692 --> 00:34:26,452
I'm not familiar.

730
00:34:38,012 --> 00:34:38,573
you

731
00:34:39,252 --> 00:34:40,413
What did you ask me yesterday?

732
00:34:42,172 --> 00:34:43,133
Let me ask you something.

733
00:34:44,653 --> 00:34:46,293
Would you like to be the coach of our team?

734
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:47,853
Please.

735
00:34:54,732 --> 00:34:55,373
Please.

736
00:34:55,813 --> 00:34:56,853
Call me Brother Feng.

737
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:57,772
Brother Feng,

738
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:58,692
Not you.

739
00:34:59,212 --> 00:35:00,012
He can call.

740
00:35:06,532 --> 00:35:07,133
Brother Feng,

741
00:35:18,692 --> 00:35:19,452
You're welcome.

742
00:35:24,172 --> 00:35:24,772
Look.

743
00:35:24,772 --> 00:35:26,653
They assumed the enemy of the path had no pressure.

744
00:35:26,932 --> 00:35:28,212
Smoke and seal the middle road.

745
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:29,212
Other teammates follow.

746
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:30,293
Once the enemy presses forward,

747
00:35:30,293 --> 00:35:31,452
Change your tactics.

748
00:35:31,452 --> 00:35:32,732
Put a sniper in the middle.

749
00:35:32,732 --> 00:35:33,893
When we played Tiger Team,

750
00:35:33,893 --> 00:35:34,692
The tactics I used.

751
00:35:35,492 --> 00:35:37,093
This is the game TNT played the day before yesterday.

752
00:35:37,813 --> 00:35:38,732
The gravity

753
00:35:39,093 --> 00:35:40,373
Used similar tactics.

754
00:35:41,093 --> 00:35:42,613
Do you suspect that Xu Wei fled to Japan?

755
00:35:43,212 --> 00:35:44,413
We can't rule it out.

756
00:35:45,653 --> 00:35:46,932
The police wanted him for a long time.

757
00:35:46,932 --> 00:35:47,893
Without catching him.

758
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:49,613
They suspect that

759
00:35:49,613 --> 00:35:51,172
Xu Wei has left the country illegally.

760
00:35:52,093 --> 00:35:52,972
And a few days ago,

761
00:35:53,492 --> 00:35:54,732
TNT has just been officially announced.

762
00:35:54,732 --> 00:35:55,853
A new coach.

763
00:35:56,813 --> 00:35:58,613
Change the coach before the game.

764
00:35:59,853 --> 00:36:01,172
Do you have more videos of the competition?

765
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:02,772
I want to confirm it.

766
00:36:03,212 --> 00:36:03,732
Yes

767
00:36:05,172 --> 00:36:06,492
If it's really him,

768
00:36:07,093 --> 00:36:08,373
When we go to Singapore this time,

769
00:36:08,653 --> 00:36:09,573
It will be interesting.

770
00:36:11,893 --> 00:36:13,093
No matter where he went,

771
00:36:15,572 --> 00:36:16,773
We won't let him off.

772
00:36:20,253 --> 00:36:21,893
Why did you change your mind suddenly?

773
00:36:23,532 --> 00:36:24,733
Didn't you say that

774
00:36:24,733 --> 00:36:26,853
Aren't you going back to e-sports?

775
00:36:29,052 --> 00:36:30,972
When I entered the training room of Beiqi Team yesterday,

776
00:36:31,452 --> 00:36:33,132
I saw him and his teammates shouting.

777
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,773
I heard the mouse and keyboard.

778
00:36:38,492 --> 00:36:39,612
Reminds me of the Steel Coin Team.

779
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:43,012
What is engraved in the bones.

780
00:36:43,972 --> 00:36:44,652
I can't change it.

781
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,293
Because that's what you really love.

782
00:36:51,773 --> 00:36:53,092
Congratulations on your new job.

783
00:36:53,572 --> 00:36:54,132
Coach Xiao.

784
00:37:14,132 --> 00:37:15,012
Besides work,

785
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:16,773
Xiao Bei and I

786
00:37:17,213 --> 00:37:18,773
And found an important clue.

787
00:37:20,173 --> 00:37:21,012
About Xu Wei,

788
00:37:22,572 --> 00:37:24,132
He might have fled abroad.

789
00:37:25,293 --> 00:37:26,413
Now I'm coaching a team

790
00:37:26,413 --> 00:37:28,092
The Japanese team called TNT.

791
00:37:30,052 --> 00:37:31,853
Xiao Bei showed me a lot of videos of him.

792
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:33,572
I studied it carefully.

793
00:37:34,413 --> 00:37:36,733
And tactics.

794
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:38,333
Is what he likes.

795
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,132
It's not a coincidence.

796
00:37:41,612 --> 00:37:43,693
And fled abroad to avoid the law.

797
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:45,213
Using the Crossfire Premier League match

798
00:37:45,213 --> 00:37:46,173
Stage a comeback

799
00:37:46,773 --> 00:37:48,293
This is indeed Xu Wei's style.

800
00:37:48,693 --> 00:37:50,532
I will go to Singapore with Xiao Bei and them.

801
00:37:51,693 --> 00:37:52,413
After a while,

802
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:54,293
I don't think Xu Wei will come out to see you.

803
00:38:01,052 --> 00:38:02,452
You're Coach Xiao now.

804
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:05,052
Should I change this hair?

805
00:38:11,213 --> 00:38:12,572
I'll take the middle route. Go to A.

806
00:38:12,572 --> 00:38:12,813
Received

807
00:38:12,813 --> 00:38:13,532
We lost one in the middle.

808
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:14,813
Amazing

809
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:15,652
WangKai

810
00:38:15,932 --> 00:38:16,893
Remember to cover Xiao Bei.

811
00:38:16,893 --> 00:38:17,373
good

812
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:18,853
Brother Feng,

813
00:38:18,972 --> 00:38:19,972
Why are you drinking?

814
00:38:21,293 --> 00:38:22,253
Don't you know that?

815
00:38:22,253 --> 00:38:24,652
We've been drinking

816
00:38:24,652 --> 00:38:25,693
To the final.

817
00:38:25,813 --> 00:38:26,373
After drinking,

818
00:38:26,373 --> 00:38:27,893
The fighting power increases four times.

819
00:38:27,893 --> 00:38:28,972
You can do this.

820
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:29,893
Do you want to try it?

821
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:30,532
other

822
00:38:31,052 --> 00:38:31,972
Their drinking capacity

823
00:38:32,213 --> 00:38:33,733
After drinking, forget about playing games.

824
00:38:33,733 --> 00:38:34,373
I can't even walk.

825
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:35,733
a row

826
00:38:35,853 --> 00:38:36,293
good

827
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:37,572
Keep practicing.

828
00:38:37,893 --> 00:38:38,293
Xiaobei

829
00:38:39,173 --> 00:38:39,853
Someone is looking for you.

830
00:38:44,132 --> 00:38:44,972
My eyelids

831
00:38:44,972 --> 00:38:46,092
Why are you dancing all the time?

832
00:38:46,293 --> 00:38:46,853
Yes?

833
00:38:47,853 --> 00:38:48,733
For the battle?

834
00:38:48,733 --> 00:38:49,652
I want to join you.

835
00:38:51,932 --> 00:38:54,012
You're the highest paid player in the league.

836
00:38:54,693 --> 00:38:55,693
Our team can't afford you.

837
00:38:55,932 --> 00:38:56,532
I don't want money.

838
00:38:56,532 --> 00:38:57,333
There's no other way.

839
00:38:58,333 --> 00:38:59,932
The main position of our team is full.

840
00:38:59,932 --> 00:39:00,813
After I join,

841
00:39:01,012 --> 00:39:01,813
Can take care of your team.

842
00:39:01,813 --> 00:39:03,092
The problem of attacking the strong and defending the weak

843
00:39:06,612 --> 00:39:07,373
Added tactical changes

844
00:39:07,373 --> 00:39:08,972
Will greatly increase the winning rate of your endgame.

845
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:09,932
Why do I feel

846
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:10,932
You're not here to join.

847
00:39:11,773 --> 00:39:12,572
Are you here to stir up trouble?

848
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:15,213
I'm just telling the truth.

849
00:39:15,213 --> 00:39:16,253
I heard there are many teams.

850
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:17,373
And paid a lot of money to get you.

851
00:39:18,293 --> 00:39:19,293
Why did you choose us?

852
00:39:19,972 --> 00:39:21,132
Because I want to be the champion.

853
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:23,813
So straightforward?

854
00:39:24,253 --> 00:39:25,173
champion

855
00:39:26,213 --> 00:39:26,893
Handsome

856
00:39:29,532 --> 00:39:30,413
The competition is to win.

857
00:39:31,652 --> 00:39:33,132
I don't think there's anything to say.

858
00:39:33,132 --> 00:39:34,452
If everyone is Buddhist,

859
00:39:35,052 --> 00:39:36,572
It won't benefit the industry.

860
00:39:38,173 --> 00:39:38,893
I admit that

861
00:39:39,572 --> 00:39:40,893
I'm glad you came.

862
00:39:41,173 --> 00:39:42,173
But I'm really sorry.

863
00:39:42,532 --> 00:39:43,733
The main force of our team is full.

864
00:39:45,853 --> 00:39:46,373
captain

865
00:39:46,773 --> 00:39:47,452
Let him come.

866
00:39:47,693 --> 00:39:48,813
I can be the backup.

867
00:39:49,492 --> 00:39:50,052
Xiangzi.

868
00:39:50,052 --> 00:39:51,293
You don't want to play in the Crossfire Premier League?

869
00:39:52,173 --> 00:39:53,132
think

870
00:39:53,132 --> 00:39:55,012
Why don't you dream about it?

871
00:39:57,092 --> 00:39:58,253
But when you go out to compete,

872
00:39:58,492 --> 00:39:59,893
Will definitely be the best.

873
00:40:00,092 --> 00:40:01,173
If King comes to our team,

874
00:40:01,853 --> 00:40:03,532
Will definitely make us proud.

875
00:40:03,932 --> 00:40:04,652
Besides,

876
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:05,932
I'll be the substitute.

877
00:40:05,932 --> 00:40:07,132
Can win the championship.

878
00:40:07,132 --> 00:40:07,733
is or isn't

879
00:40:09,052 --> 00:40:10,413
Even if I agree with you,

880
00:40:11,173 --> 00:40:11,813
Now our team

881
00:40:11,813 --> 00:40:13,092
It's not up to me anymore.

882
00:40:13,092 --> 00:40:14,213
I have to listen to my coach.

883
00:40:28,253 --> 00:40:29,693
You must be Seven Xiao Feng.

884
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,173
I've watched all your videos.

885
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:32,693
I'm practicing.

886
00:40:32,893 --> 00:40:34,092
Because of you.

887
00:40:34,213 --> 00:40:34,893
have to

888
00:40:35,253 --> 00:40:36,132
Another fan.

889
00:40:36,373 --> 00:40:37,572
You can join the team.

890
00:40:38,253 --> 00:40:39,773
But I don't promise the main position.

891
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:40,132
Is that okay?

892
00:40:40,373 --> 00:40:41,452
I can compete fairly.

893
00:40:42,052 --> 00:40:43,213
Who is in good condition?

894
00:40:43,213 --> 00:40:43,932
we

895
00:40:43,932 --> 00:40:45,492
I don't have so much time to work on it.

896
00:40:45,492 --> 00:40:46,773
I have 24 hours a day.

897
00:40:47,213 --> 00:40:47,813
good

898
00:40:48,733 --> 00:40:50,092
If you can't get it together,

899
00:40:50,092 --> 00:40:51,773
Take your ass off and leave.

900
00:40:51,773 --> 00:40:52,813
I will definitely stay.

901
00:40:55,492 --> 00:40:56,333
Nice guy.

902
00:40:56,853 --> 00:40:57,452
drink

903
00:40:58,693 --> 00:40:59,373
Drink it.

904
00:41:01,253 --> 00:41:02,173
One can each.

905
00:41:02,173 --> 00:41:03,132
No one is allowed to drink too much.

906
00:41:04,733 --> 00:41:05,333
Cheers!

907
00:41:08,293 --> 00:41:09,052
Go on.

908
00:41:15,132 --> 00:41:16,413
Come on

909
00:41:24,813 --> 00:41:25,733
This ring is good.

910
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:28,092
You'll be my man with my ring.

911
00:41:31,773 --> 00:41:32,333
Come on.

912
00:41:32,693 --> 00:41:33,132
coach

913
00:41:33,373 --> 00:41:34,893
Then let's go to the map.

914
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:35,253
go

915
00:41:35,253 --> 00:41:36,173
Easy to go

916
00:41:36,173 --> 00:41:36,693
Set out

917
00:41:37,173 --> 00:41:38,612
The head of Black Town, right?

918
00:41:40,452 --> 00:41:40,932
What's up

919
00:41:41,173 --> 00:41:43,092
TNT just registered its official Weibo.

920
00:41:43,092 --> 00:41:44,293
The first one is Art. Let's...

921
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,773
You're here by name.

922
00:41:52,813 --> 00:41:53,813
We need to respond.

923
00:41:53,932 --> 00:41:55,413
Are you sure you want to respond now?

924
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:55,972
yes

925
00:41:56,253 --> 00:41:56,932
otherwise

926
00:41:56,932 --> 00:41:58,012
They thought we were scared.

927
00:41:58,293 --> 00:42:00,012
We're going out to play a game.

928
00:42:00,012 --> 00:42:01,173
Represents the country.

929
00:42:01,173 --> 00:42:03,092
You can't lose.

930
00:42:03,293 --> 00:42:04,253
How should we respond?

931
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:05,972
I'll ask the publicity department to write a draft.

932
00:42:05,972 --> 00:42:06,813
Let me show you.

933
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:08,492
Don't bother.

934
00:42:09,932 --> 00:42:10,733
Just three words.
