=Episode 9=

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,520
(Fate Street, Ling Kingdom)
Ling Cang, First Prince of Ling,

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,080
has committed the heinous crime

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,720
of operating a secret brothel,

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,280
oppressing the people,

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,920
and colluding with court officials.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,040
Ashamed before the heavens,

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,640
and ashamed before the people,

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,840
I strip him of his title as Prince Cang,

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,840
sentence him to one hundred lashes,

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,200
to be witnessed by all citizens of the capital.

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,360
He must die!

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,560
Unbelievable! Beat him to death!

15
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,990
Let this serve as a warning!

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,050
Keep beating!

17
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,540
Beat him to death!

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,360
He doesn't deserve to live!

19
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,640
Don't look.

20
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,720
Ling Cang, First Prince of Ling,

21
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,040
has committed the heinous crime

22
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,640
of operating a secret brothel,

23
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,160
oppressing the people,

24
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,720
and colluding with court officials.

25
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,880
Beat him to death!

26
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,880
He deserves it!

27
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,800
Ashamed before the heavens,

28
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,720
and ashamed before the people,

29
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,960
I strip him of his title as Prince Cang,

30
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,520
sentence him to one hundred lashes,

31
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,120

Let me go!

90
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,920
Your Highness.

91
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,400
You enter my estate

92
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,720
without warning,

93
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,200
and detain my guard.

94
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,120
What is the meaning of this?

95
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,800
Do you remember

96
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,360
what you said to me

97
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,200
at the ceremonial archery banquet?

98
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,520
You said the Princess of Yan
had humiliated you,

99
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,320
and you couldn't bear the resentment,

100
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,600
so you begged me to let you take revenge.

101
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,760
But now?

102
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,600
You feed her well,

103
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,000
assign guards to protect her,

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,600
even treat her wounds.

105
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,280
Is this how a prisoner

106
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,040
should be treated?

107
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,840
You handed her over to me.

108
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,760
That makes her mine.

109
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,720
How I deal with her

110
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,720
is none of your business.

111
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,960
She's my war trophy.

112
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,680
I'm taking her with me.

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,440
I knew it!

114
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,080
Yun would never abandon me!

115
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,440
Willing or not,

116
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,760
one day,

117
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,880
I will reclaim my body

118
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,360
and return to his side.

119
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,440
Anning,

120
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,200
everything I did before,

121
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,800
was for your own good.

122
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,800
Think about it.

123
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,880
You're a princess,

124
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,560
becoming a captive

125
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,200
means endless humiliation and suffering.

126
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
I swear,

127
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,040
if you come back with me today,

128
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,400
I will treat you well from now on.

129
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,080
I won't let you suffer again.

130
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,960
Alright?

131
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,520
Alright.

132
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,520
I have just one condition.

133
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,200
Name it.

134
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,760
Whatever it is.

135
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,360
Let me

136
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,920
personally sever your tendons,

137
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,720
and shoot an arrow through your heart.

138
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,080
Then I'll go back with you.

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,360
A useless scum like him?

140
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,320
He'll never take her from me.

141
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,560
Your Highness, I...

142
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,280
Withdraw.

143
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,640
Ling Cang!

144
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,480
Ling Cang, are you alright?

145
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,120
I'm

146
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,880
fine.

147
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,840
Let me treat your wounds.

148
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,150
At a time like this,

149
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,080
why bother being so proper?

150
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,480
I'm sorry.

151
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,840
Why are you suddenly apologizing to me?

152
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,160
You saved me this time.

153
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,880
I should

154
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,680
be the one thanking you.

155
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,440
I heard

156
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,480
from Chi Xiao

157
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,520
about your past

158
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,400
with the King and Ling Yun.

159
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,160
Before,

160
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,440
I misunderstood you.

161
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,720
It's fine.

162
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,360
It's all in the past now.

163
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,120
You don't need to feel guilty.

164
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,600
(The debt I owe you keeps growing.)

165
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,840
(How will I ever repay it?)

166
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,880
By the way,

167
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,840
how did you know

168
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,800
I was on that street?

169
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,400
I saw the vision.

170
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,040
You're a cultivator.

171
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,280
Your spiritual power is so strong.

172
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,680
Why would you kneel in the street,

173
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,880
letting them treat you that way?

174
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,800
Severing ties

175
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,160
with my kin requires a price.

176
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,880
It's alright.

177
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,680
I can take it.

178
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,440
You did well.

179
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,440
We don't get to choose our birth family,

180
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,160
but we can

181
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,120
choose who becomes our true family

182
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,320
and how we will spend our lifetime.

183
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,080
Filthy people like Ling Yun

184
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,600
should be tossed far, far away.

185
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,440
In a lifetime,

186
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,600
no, ten lifetimes, you should never
see him again.

187
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,000
You're easy to cheer up.

188
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,600
That's because I believe in you.

189
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,800
I told you:

190
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,680
with you around,

191
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,840
I bet I'll win.

192
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,200
I have nothing left now.

193
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,920
All I can do for you

194
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,600
are little things.

195
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,920
That's already more than enough.

196
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,120
Besides,

197
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,200
I'm alone in this world.

198
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,560
The worst that could happen

199
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,560
is death.

200
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,880
If you don't mind,

201
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,640
I can be your family.

202
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,560
What kind of family?

203
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,920
Isn't family

204
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,720
just family?

205
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,000
What difference does it make?

206
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,840
It does make a difference.

207
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,000
You're

208
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,240
not like the rest.

209
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,960
By the way,

210
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,280
why's that clay figurine on the table broken?

211
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,960
When someone dies,

212
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,760
their figurines break too.

213
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,680
Just like when night falls,

214
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,160
light

215
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,440
can no longer reach in.

216
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,040
It'll be light again.

217
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,520
I...

218
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,840
Did I hurt you?

219
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,680
I'm...

220
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,680
It's okay.

221
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,280
I've always been curious.

222
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,520
Is Chi Xiao also made of clay?

223
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,440
When I was cultivating outside the palace,

224
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
I was bored,

225
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,840
so I sculpted a little clay figure
to keep me company.

226
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,080
No wonder

227
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,920
Chi Xiao talks so much.

228
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,200
Yeah, right.

229
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,440
He never shuts up.

230
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,000
(You must've suffered a lot.)

231
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,000
No matter how long the night,

232
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,520
the sun will rise.

(The next day)
I've finally taken my body back!

258
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,760
(Qin Se Sheng Qing)
I'm going to see Dear Yun!

259
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,610
Out of my way!

260
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,800
I'm going to see Dear Yun!

261
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,910
Without His Highness's permission,

262
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,240
you're not going anywhere.

263
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,830
I'm not one of your prince's people.

264
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,160
Why should I listen to him?

265
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,200
Move!

266
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,640
You're still going to Ling Yun?

267
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,360
What's so good about him?

268
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,480
Move aside!

269
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,760
Chi Xiao.

270
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,120
So you're the soul that caused
her family's downfall?

271
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,120
Yeah, so what?

272
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,280
You all hate me.

273
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,840
Then let me go!

274
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,040
(I have to find a way to drive her soul out.)

275
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,640
Move aside!

276
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,960
Your Highness, what are you doing?

277
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,640
Nether Judge in the Ghost Market
knows how to split souls.

278
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,360
He can resolve Anning's dual-soul condition.
