=Episode 18=

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,320
Father.

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,480
Mother.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,840
Anning.

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,240
Those who dare defy fate...

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,600
Don't come closer!

8
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,280
Alright.

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,640
I won't.

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,280
Thank you for saving me.

11
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,640
As long as you live,

12
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,560
I'd gladly die.

13
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,240
I don't want anyone to die,

14
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,200
including you.

15
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,880
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,640
I know

17
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,600
this isn't your fault.

18
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,400
It's the Asura King.

19
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,920
In a past life, I heard the Immortals say,

20
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,880
when heaven and earth first formed,

21
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,280
four divine artifacts were born.

22
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,560
Among them

23
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,120
were the Crimson Soul Pearl
and the Luminous Heart.

24
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,280
The Asura King killed me twice,

25
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,040
and both times took one of the artifacts.

26
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,520
It must be tied

27
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,160
to the fate he's imposed on us.

28
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,040
I've found his hiding place.

29
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,240
In the Divine Realm, there's a tower

30
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,240
called the Providence Vault.

31
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,520
It governs the fate of all creation.

32
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,240
It's ruled jointly by Fate
and the Star Lord of Celestial Warfare.

33
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,240
Star Lord of Celestial Warfare?

34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,240
That's right.

35
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,760
He has no form or shape.

36
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,400
He's just used by Fate to possess

37
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,800
the person dearest to one
who tries to change fate

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,240
and execute them.

39
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,280
The Divine Attendant Xi Yue,
in her attempt to change her fate,

40
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,100
(Xi Yue, Divine Attendant)

41
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,260
(Asura King, Lord of Ghost Realm)

42
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,360
killed the Asura King,

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,520
forcing Star Lord of Celestial Warfare
to descend.

44
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,560
You...

45
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,720
Aren't you afraid that Star Lord
will come kill you?

46
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,800
They say he is without emotion.

47
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,560
But if I inject half my soul into you,

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,520
I can make you my own.

49
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,560
Into me?

50
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,400
That's right.

51
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,120
Didn't you say

52
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,760
he possesses the one

53
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,560
dearest to the defier of fate?

54
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,960
Too bad,

55
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,600
I have no parents,

56
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,920
no friends,

57
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,960
no lover.

58
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,400
Even my master

59
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,120
was killed by me long ago.

60
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,560
So now,

61
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,960
I have no choice

62
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,560
but to make you my most precious person.

63
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,960
Xi Yue waited until Star Lord
had possessed someone,

64
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,320
then fused half of her own soul into him.

65
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,960
That's how he

66
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,080
gained emotions and desires.

67
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,690
From this moment forward,

68
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,240
you belong to me.

69
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,560
You serve only me.

70
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,560
Yes.

71
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,080
Asura, as a name

72
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,760
is ugly.

73
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,960
I'll give you a new one.

74
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,240
There was once someone I really liked.

75
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,840
His name was Yu Han.

76
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,960
But he didn't like me,

77
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,920
so I killed him.

78
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,920
From now on,

79
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,040
you'll bear his name.

80
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,120
Alright?

81
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,320
Yes.

82
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,960
Xi Yue used Yu Han

83
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,440
to take control of the Providence Vault.

84
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,800
Then she swapped fates

85
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,480
with who you once were.

86
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,680
Lu Anning, Divine Realm princess,

87
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,360
became the venerated Empress.

88
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,120
Xi Yue, born in misery,

89
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,040
trained in demonic ways,

90
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,840
and was slain

91
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,520
by Empress Jing Yun.

92
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,720
Xi Yue, the Sovereign of Fate,

93
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,560
rules the Providence Vault

94
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,880
and controls the fate of all living beings.

95
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,740
(Lu Anning serves her love for eternity.)

96
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,900
(In the end, dies miserably by his hand.)

97
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,720
One person's change of fate

98
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,400
affects the destiny of all creation.

99
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,690
Many lives worsen as a result.

100
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,400
But still,

101
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,000
Xi Yue was not satisfied.

102
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,520
She began gathering the four divine artifacts,

103
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,680
hoping to surpass Fate itself.

104
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,920
When she discovered you possessed artifacts,

105
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,600
she killed you in two lifetimes.

106
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,520
That is the origin of our tragic fate.

107
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,000
So it was

108
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,520
Xi Yue.

109
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,200
Now that you've revived,

110
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,000
they must have sensed it.

111
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,920
They'll come

112
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,360
to seize the Luminous Heart.

113
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,200
But don't worry.

114
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,440
I've set up barriers around the entire estate.

115
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,800
We won't repeat our past mistakes.

116
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,000
So Anning,

117
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,560
don't be afraid.

118
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,840
I understand.

119
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,480
I did kill you twice.

120
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,240
How could you not be afraid?

121
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,420
I...

122
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,040
Come in.

123
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,310
Anning,

124
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,200
you've just returned to life.

125
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,440
Your spirit is still unstable.

126
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,400
This is Five Qi Elixir.

127
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,520
It'll help stabilize your divine soul.

128
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,320
Don't worry.

129
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,120
Until you're ready to accept me,

130
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,270
I won't come near you.

131
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,080
I didn't mean it like that.

132
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,360
You don't need to spare my feelings or explain.

133
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,480
That'll only make it harder for me.

134
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,880
Anning,

135
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,720
I only want you to be happy

136
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,000
and your wishes to come true.

137
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,680
If there's nothing else,

138
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,520
I'll take my leave.
