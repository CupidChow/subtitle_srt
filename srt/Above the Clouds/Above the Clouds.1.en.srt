1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,060
(Ye Sha's Sea of Consciousness)

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,000
(In the Clouds World,)

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,800
(everyone's fate)

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,280
(Ye Sha, disciple of the Veilcloud Sect)
(is set by the Mirror of Fate.)

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,280
(Those who try to defy fate)

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,640
(will be punished by destiny.)

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,320
Ye Sha,

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,360
you can't break through
the Nascent Soul stage this way.

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,960
Why not dual cultivate with me?

10
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,900
(Cold Pool)

11
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,540
(Lu Anning,
Sect Scion of the Lingyun Lu Residence)

12
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,600
Since we've already become partners,

13
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,040
sooner or later we'll need to dual cultivate.

14
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,000
Anning,

15
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,960
your true heart

16
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,560
is the most precious thing in the world.

17
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,360
I will never betray you in this life.

18
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,120
(If you do not betray me,)

19
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,320
(I will not betray you.)

20
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,360
The Crimson Spirit Pearl nourished
by true love is truly powerful.

21
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,200
With it, I can not only break through
the Nascent Soul stage,

22
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,440
but even reach the Divine Transformation stage.

23
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,360
I'm still alive.

24
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,160
I'm still alive.

25
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,640
Why are there two of me?

26
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,880
That body is the real you.

27
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,400
If you cannot change your fate,

28
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,960
soon

29
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,880
you will be killed by the one you love most,

30
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,120
your entire clan will be exterminated.

31
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,040
Who are you?

32
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,480
(Lu Anning's Divine Consciousness)
I am your divine consciousness,

33
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,680
here to help you change your fate.

34
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,920
Change fate?

35
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,560
Everyone's destiny in this world

36
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,440
is predetermined.

37
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,800
And your fate

38
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,400
is to give everything to the man you love,

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,040
only to be tormented to death.

40
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,160
That man

41
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,520
will then lose his beloved forever

42
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,880
and live a life full of guilt.

43
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,600
The only way to change that

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,440
is to strike first and kill him.

45
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,280
Impossible.

46
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,920
Ye Sha and I have been in love for ten years.

47
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,960
He would never kill me.

48
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,520
It's destiny that made you believe that,

49
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,560
just like it's destiny that makes him kill you.

50
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,440
Don't believe it?

51
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,680
See what he's doing now.

52
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,600
(Ye Sha,)

53
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,320
(after ten years of love,
are you really going to kill me?)

54
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,880
Anning,

55
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,360
your true heart

56
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,280
is the most precious thing in the world.

57
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,760
I will never betray you in this life.

we've loved each other for ten years.

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,280

Nothing.

78
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,760
Dual cultivation requires two hearts

79
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,040
to be connected and minds in sync.

80
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,480
Maybe

81
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,720
I'm just a little nervous.

82
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,280
Honey,

83
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,160
could you not look at me now?

84
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,240
Alright.

85
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,280
(Ye Sha,)

86
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,960
(you should not have betrayed me)

00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,180
(Providence Vault)

90
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,000
(Yu Han, Star Lord of Celestial Warfare)
Lu Anning, in her 1,001 life,

91
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,800
became partners with Ye Sha
of the Veilcloud Sect,

92
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,720
and was killed by him.

93
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,240
Her entire clan was slaughtered.

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,880
Lu Anning, in her 1,001 life,

95
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,840
after becoming partners with Ye Sha
of the Veilcloud Sect,

96
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,480
- Xi Yue.
- was betrayed by Ye Sha.

97
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,960
- Xi Yue.
- She killed Ye Sha in return,

98
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,600
- Are you alright?
- and stepped onto the Path of Ruthlessness,

99
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,120
(Xi Yue, Sovereign of Fate)
lived out her days in peace.

100
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,320
That wretched Lu Anning actually

101
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,960
managed to change her fate.

102
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,640
Our destinies are linked.

103
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,320
If she changes hers,

104
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,240
I will die.

105
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,320
Please rest assured.

106
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,040
Now that I've changed her fate,

107
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,680
I won't let her change it back.

108
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Tonight,

109
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,760
Ye Sha will kill her

110
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,240
by gouging her heart and taking her pearl.

111
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,720
Quickly retrieve the Crimson Spirit Pearl.

112
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,040
Only by gathering the Four Divine Artifacts

113
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,320
can I truly reshape destiny.

114
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,280
Understood.

115
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,320
I will personally retrieve

116
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,360
the spirit pearl for you.

117
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,040
Those who dare defy fate

118
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,920
shall die.

119
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,960
In over a thousand lifetimes,

120
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,160
Lu Anning always died as written
in the Mirror of Fate.

121
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,560
Why, in this life,

122
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,720
did she suddenly change her destiny?

123
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,240
Although we control the Providence Vault

124
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,040
and can manipulate the fate of the world,

125
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,280
Lu Anning is still an Exalted Deity.

126
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,840
We forcibly twisted her divine fate

127
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,160
into the lowest rank. That's why...

128
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,720
Isn't it because you've yet to find

129
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,040
the remaining two divine artifacts?

130
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,000
Not only can we not fully strip
Lu Anning of her divine destiny,

131
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,080
we also cannot fully rewrite my fate.

132
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,080
I'm truly tired of not being able

133
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,960
to control my own destiny,

134
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,640
and even more tired of having my fate
intertwined with Lu Anning's.

135
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,240
Please calm your anger.

136
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,880
I've found that the Luminous Heart
has condensed in the mortal realm.

137
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,840
Very soon, I'll be able to gather
all the artifacts.

138
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,880
By then, I'll help you completely
change your destiny.

139
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,240
Lu Anning, in her 1,002 life,

140
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,880
is Princess Yan Anning of the Yan Kingdom,

141
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,680
the first female emperor of Yan,

142
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,720
who led the kingdom into a golden age.

143
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,560
Quick,

144
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,360
change her fate back.

145
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,960
We cannot allow her to succeed.

146
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,120
Lu Anning, in her 1,002 life,

147
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,240
is Princess Yan Anning of the Yan Kingdom.

148
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,200
Please rest assured.

149
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,920
I've already used the divine artifact

150
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,080
to trap her fate.

151
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,040
She can no longer change it.

152
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,370
Princess Yan Anning of the Yan Kingdom,

153
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,480
the first female emperor of Yan...

154
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,160
Yan Anning is marrying
for the sake of the kingdom.

155
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,640
Once today's conferment ceremony concludes,

156
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,040
Your Highness will become
the first crown princess of Great Yan.

157
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,000
(Yan Anning, Princess of Yan)
From the ministers and the emperor,

158
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,480
(Reincarnation of Lu Anning)
to the common people,

159
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,440
all await you to lead the nation

160
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,160
and become empress.

161
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,560
You're so talkative.

162
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,120
That's not what I said.

163
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,560
(Yunrou, Yan Anning's maid)
You have brought blessings to the people.

164
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,160
So naturally, they're willing to honor you
as empress.

165
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,240
That's why we must protect them

166
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,360
and never let them down.

167
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,240
Let's go.

168
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,160
Yunrou.

169
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,600
Yunrou.

170
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,360
Why did the barley suddenly
turn into red carpet?

171
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,160
What barley?

172
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,200
The marriage ceremony is supposed
to have red silk laid out.

173
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,960
Marriage ceremony?

174
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,440
Isn't today the conferment ceremony
to crown me as crown princess?

175
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,000
There's no such title as crown princess
in Great Yan.

176
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,200
Your Highness,

177
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,480
did you not sleep well?

178
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,600
Today is an important occasion.

179
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,640
You must not speak carelessly.

180
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,720
No.

181
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,760
Something is wrong.

182
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,360
I must ask Father and Mother about this.

183
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,040
Your Highness.

184
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,600
Your Highness, mind your manners.

185
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,200
(Taiji Hall, Yan Palace)

186
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,040
Your Highness.

187
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,720
Your Majesty,

188
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,920
if the marriage doesn't proceed,

189
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,160
the Ling Kingdom will refuse to sell us grain.

190
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,120
If the people have no food,

191
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,520
chaos will break out.

192
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,480
That's right, Your Majesty.

193
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,080
Before the Ling Kingdom even attacks,

194
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,860
the people will revolt.

195
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,080
(King of Yan, Queen of Yan)
Your Majesty,

196
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,320
the people of Ling have always
been brutal to us.

197
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,920
If the Princess doesn't marry,

198
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,840
I fear...

199
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,680
The Princess is here.

200
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,160
Greetings, Father and Mother.

201
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,920
Rise, Anning.

202
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,000
Thank you, Father and Mother.

203
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,520
Father,

204
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,760
isn't today

205
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,680
the ceremony to name me crown princess?

206
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,360
Why has it become a marriage arrangement?

207
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,360
Crown princess?

208
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,720
Today is the day of your marriage
to the eldest prince

209
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,000
of the Ling Kingdom.

210
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,520
Since childhood, Father has taught me

211
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,600
politics and statecraft.

212
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,280
Was it all so that I would marry
into another family,

213
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,920
and spend my life confined
to the inner chambers?

214
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,160
Well...

215
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,840
Your marriage is also for the good of Yan.

216
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,120
(What's going on?)

217
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,000
(Why don't any of them remember?)

218
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,640
The Princess doesn't look willing to marry.

219
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,320
Your Majesty,

220
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,040
this concerns both kingdoms.
The Princess has no say in it.

221
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,720
Anning,

222
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,040
if you don't marry,

223
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,160
the Ling Kingdom won't sell us grain.

224
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,880
The granaries are already empty.

225
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,800
(No food?)

226
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,280
(I began promoting wheat and millet)

227
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,880
(nationwide three years ago.)

228
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,480
(The harvests have been abundant.)

229
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,200
(How could we be short on grain?)

230
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,480
(Something is wrong.)

231
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,320
The Princess eats from the people's labor,

232
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,480
so she should bring them blessings.

233
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,720
To refuse

234
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,680
is to betray the people of Yan.

235
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,160
That won't do.

236
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,080
(I'll stop the marriage first)

237
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,240
(and then figure out why everyone has changed.)

238
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,640
As the Princess,

239
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,080
I understand the responsibilities

240
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,840
better than any of you.

241
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,920
But I will not make a meaningless sacrifice.

242
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,800
As the only child of Father and Mother,

243
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,880
if I go through with this marriage,

244
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,160
it's as if I'm handing over Yan

245
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,360
to the Ling Kingdom.

246
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,680
She speaks the truth.

247
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,000
Yes, yes.

248
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,160
Are you trying to make me commit treason,

249
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,800
or are you planning

250
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,760
to become subjects of the Ling Kingdom?

251
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,880
Your Majesty,

252
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,040
what Her Highness says makes sense.

253
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,000
- That's right.
- She's right.

254
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

255
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,760
Yeah.

256
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,640
Enough.

257
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,720
I won't force you.

258
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,400
Thank you, Father and Mother.

259
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,720
But this marriage

260
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,480
will bring nothing but harm to Yan.

261
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,360
Let's not even talk about

262
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,320
how marrying means handing our kingdom over.

263
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,000
Just look at their eldest prince,

264
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,040
at nine, he murdered his own mother
and was exiled from the palace.

265
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,720
Not only did he show no remorse,

266
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,920
his behavior grew even more vicious and cruel.

267
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,480
The people of Ling call him a demon of Asura

268
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,720
and avoid him like the plague.

269
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,120
He is by no means a suitable match.

270
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,320
Father, please draft the annulment immediately

271
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,640
and send him back to wherever he came from.

272
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,200
Based on rumors alone, you would send me away

273
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,160
and destroy the alliance between two nations?

274
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,800
Is this

275
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,040
Yan's sincerity?
