=Episode 16=

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,840
How about

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,960
we try the memory restoration array?

5
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,500
Ye Sha.

6
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,500
Ye Sha?

7
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,800
Who's Ye Sha?

8
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,250
I'm Ling Cang,

9
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:05,660
not Ye Sha.

10
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,140
You are Ye Sha!

11
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,380
Look closely.

12
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,140
Do I look anything like him?

13
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,500
Seems

14
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,500
there are indeed some differences.

15
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,180
Forget it.

16
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,380
You two go out first.

17
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,100
Let's go.

18
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,340
You...

19
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,820
Well? Has she regained her memory?

20
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,620
I've already told her everything.

21
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,700
She still doesn't remember a thing.

22
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,540
I have an idea,

23
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,940
though I'm not sure if it will work.

24
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,500
What is it?

25
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,560
Amnesia only seals memories temporarily,

26
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,740
it's not true forgetting.

27
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,340
If you take her to relive the past,

28
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,340
if she sees familiar things,

29
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,580
maybe she'll remember everything.

30
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,780
It's worth a try.

31
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,420
Then I'll head back to the clinic
and look through

32
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,500
the medical texts,

33
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,820
see if there's another way.

34
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,660
See you.

35
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,940
What should we do next, Your Highness?

36
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,380
The wedding thing isn't settled yet.

37
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,700
Let's take care of that first.

38
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,900
(Secret chamber in Prince Cang's residence)

39
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,190
I finally caught you.

40
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,220
(This place feels so familiar to me.)

41
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,900
(Why can't I remember anything?)

42
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,940
Do you like it?

43
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,460
The day we made our promise,

44
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,780
the same petals rained down.

45
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,380
Do you remember?

46
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,100
I...

47
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,700
I'm sorry.

48
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,860
I

49
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,700
really don't remember.

50
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,420
It's alright.

51
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,900
You don't need to apologize.

52
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,740
Besides,

53
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,300
amnesia isn't your fault.

54
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,700
By the way,

55
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,660
when we released sky lanterns,

56
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,180
you asked about my wish.

57
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,500
I didn't answer then.

58
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,820
This time,

59
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,940
I want to tell you.

60
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,860
My wish

61
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,580
is to be with you for all eternity.

62
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:34,980
It's you!

63
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,740
Return His Highness's life!

64
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,140
You really are Ling Yun's loyal dog.

65
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,940
Prepare to die!

66
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,100
I remember now!

67
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,100
Ling Cang!

68
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,460
Don't hurt him!

69
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:52,980
Anning,

70
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,460
are you alright?

71
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,700
I remember now.

72
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,060
With your strength,

73
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,620
you could have easily dodged that strike.

74
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,380
Why did you let yourself get hurt?

75
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,160
If I hadn't done that,

76
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,090
how would you have recovered your memory?

77
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,180
Don't ever do that again!

78
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,200
I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?

79
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,220
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

(Qin Se Sheng Qing)

113
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:30,800
So you're saying

114
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,500
the reason I saw those visions

115
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,230
was because the Luminous Heart is inside me?

116
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,640
And it repelled that power
at the critical moment.

117
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,660
Does that mean if I can fully harness
its power,

118
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,310
I can defy fate?

119
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,350
Yao Sheng said

120
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,920
your Luminous Heart hasn't completely
fused yet.

121
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,100
It still needs time to awaken.

122
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,410
- But the problem is...
- I know.

123
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,190
I killed Ling Yun and changed fate.

124
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,180
Fate won't let me go.

125
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,320
We need to prepare more.

126
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,140
This is...

127
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,930
This was left behind

128
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,460
when that power possessed Ling Yun.

129
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,570
I found the same energy

130
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,540
in the Hall of the Asura King.

131
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,890
The Asura King?

132
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,100
I think I've heard of him in a past life.

133
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,420
He was coerced by the Sovereign of Fate Xi Yue

134
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,920
into becoming her servant,

135
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,900
and destroyed the heavenly stairways
leading to the Divine Realm.

136
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,180
Since then,

137
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,540
no one has been able to ascend
to the Divine Realm.

138
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,180
If that energy really does belong to
the Asura King,

139
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,160
then the one manipulating us

140
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,100
is likely him,

141
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,380
not fate itself.

142
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,060
Then if we capture him,

143
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,700
can this all be ended?

144
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,300
But

145
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,300
he possessed your beloved in two lives.

146
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,270
Now that the one you love most is me,

147
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,940
he might possess me too.

148
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,660
Even if I die,

149
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,780
he could still control my body.

150
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,020
Isn't this

151
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,860
the clay figure you made before?

152
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,180
Yes.

153
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,300
This clay figure is linked to
my spirit and soul.

154
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,280
If I'm ever possessed,

155
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,860
just crush it.

156
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,650
But that will scatter your spirit and soul,

157
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,820
erasing you from existence.

158
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,280
Even if I die,

159
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,820
I don't want to become the next Ye Sha.

160
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,880
I won't let you die.

161
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,780
Didn't you say you left a backup plan?

162
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,540
Why have I

163
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,980
still not recovered?

164
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,420
Don't worry.

165
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,740
Lu Anning will never escape our grasp.

166
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,300
I had already anticipated this ending,

167
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,820
so I made preparations in advance.

168
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,850
(In Lu Anning's 1,002nd lifetime,)

169
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,700
(Yan Anning marries Ling Prince,)

170
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,660
(abused to death by him.)

171
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,940
This was the ending I originally wrote
for Lu Anning.

172
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,980
It never specified

173
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,220
which prince of Ling she would marry.

174
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,100
So even if Ling Yun is dead,

175
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,660
there will still be someone else

176
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,420
to carry out this ending with Lu Anning.

177
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,860
And that person

178
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,220
is already under my control.

179
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,820
No matter what,

180
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,820
(In Ye Sha's 1,002nd lifetime,)

181
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,220
(Prince Ling Cang)
they cannot escape their fate.

182
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,220
