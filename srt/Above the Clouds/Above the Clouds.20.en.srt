00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,760
Promise me,

2
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,960
no matter what happens,

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,480
protect yourself first.

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,800
Okay.

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,600
I promise you.

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,560
He's coming.

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,360
You're here.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,840
Let's go.

9
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,140
=Above The Clouds=

10
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,380
=Episode 20=

11
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,000
You've finally arrived.

12
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,400
So you're Xi Yue.

13
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,880
Did you remember me,

14
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,680
or did you investigate and find out?

15
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,120
What grudge lies between us

16
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,200
that you torment me in every lifetime?

17
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,320
Grudge?

18
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,560
There's no grudge between us.

19
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,720
If there's no grudge,

20
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,040
then is it your pastime

21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,360
to toy with others' fates for fun?

22
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,680
Exactly. Your fate was too good

23
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,080
and I couldn't stand it,

24
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,840
so I altered it.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,240
Who would've thought you were so stubborn?

26
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,960
You just had to defy fate,

27
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,360
and actually succeeded.

28
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,320
But this time,

29
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,990
I wonder if you'll be as lucky.

30
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,320
What do you mean?

31
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,740
What do you think?

32
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,280
Didn't you say that if I gave up
the Luminous Heart,

33
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,800
you'd help me change fate?

34
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,600
But I was lying.

35
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,160
You...

36
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,280
What, planning to hit me?

37
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,280
Do you even deserve to?

38
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,040
You're nothing more than an ant.

39
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,920
With one lift of my foot,

40
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,920
I could crush you like dust.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,720
Trying to fight me?

42
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,600
How foolish.

43
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,760
Yu Han,

44
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,160
activate the array.

45
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,120
Fuse the divine artifacts.

46
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,320
Yes.

47
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,840
She's absorbing the power of the artifacts!

48
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,400

If you truly wish to change everything,

72

you must return to ten thousand years ago.

73

Ten thousand years ago?

74
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,520
Indeed.

75
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,480
All karma stems from a catastrophe back then.

If you can alter it,

77
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,520
you can change everything,

including your fate with Ye Sha.

79

How do I go back?

80
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,400

This is...

88

The Divine Realm from ten thousand years ago.

89
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,440
Xi Yue,

90
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,400
as one of the Divine Realm,

91
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,120
you secretly practiced demonic arts

92
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,120
and broke divine laws.

93
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,560
Do you admit your guilt?

94
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,880
I trained in demonic arts

95
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,040
only to further my cultivation.

96
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,240
What crime is that?

97
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,880
Ages ago,

98
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,880
gods and demons were one.

99
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,480
Why are we

100
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,120
enemies now?

101
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,560

103
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,480
why are you...

104
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,600
Master, eons ago,

105
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,080
gods and demons were never divided.

106
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,990
Only self-interest

107
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,390
caused today's hatred.

108
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,040
So how is practicing divine arts
any different from demonic ones?

109
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,960
You shouldn't punish Xi Yue.

110
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,760
Seems I've spoiled you too much.

111
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,760
You dare defy your master

112
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,840
and disobey orders?

113
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,840
Then I'll teach you a proper lesson today.
