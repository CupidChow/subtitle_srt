00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,340
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,800
Charge!

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,560
The city guards have surrendered.

5
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,460
By order of Princess Anning,

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,200
those who surrender to Ling shall live.

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,500
Charge!

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,220
Those who refuse

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,280
shall die.

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,840
Let me out!

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,280
Her Highness was coerced.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,000
The people of Yan will not surrender.

13
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,110
We will not surrender!

14
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,640
Your Highness, wake up.

15
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,000
Otherwise, Yan will fall.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,280
Your Highness.

17
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,640
Wake up.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,720
Wake up.

19
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,240
Yunrou.

20
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,040
Yunrou!

21
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,800
Yunrou!

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,840
Your Highness.

23
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,480
You're finally back.

24
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,520
I'm back. I'm back.

25
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,520
Hold on.

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,840
I'll take you to the imperial physician.

27
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,200
I'll let them save you.

28
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,040
Your Highness.

29
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,040
It's too late.

30
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,440
It's all my fault.

31
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,720
I was useless.

32
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,720
It's my fault.

33
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,280
No, it's not your fault.

34
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,120
Yunrou.

35
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,680
Yunrou!

36
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,920
Yunrou!

37
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,800
Yunrou!

38
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,520
I'll kill you.

39
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,960
I'll kill you.

40
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,480
This is all...

41
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,070
This is all because of you.

42
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,080
You can't kill my dear Yun.

43
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,800
You gave the tiger tally to Ling Yun.

44
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,600
You let the people of Ling into the city
to slaughter my people of Yan.

45
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,880
It was you

46
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,800
who killed Yunrou

47
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,640
and my father and mother.

48
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,640
You...

49
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,440
You all knew I loved Yun,

50
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,880
yet you still tore us apart.

51
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,040
You forced me.

52
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,720
All of you forced me.

53
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,680
For the so-called love of a man,

54
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,000
you invited the wolf in

55
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,440
and destroyed Yan.

56
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,800
I'll kill you.

57
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,040
I'll kill you.

58
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,880
Father.

59
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,080
Mother.

60
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,560
(My inner force is gone?)

61
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,600
Your martial arts have been crippled.

62
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,200
Be good.

63
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,320
Don't move.

64
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,280
Ling Yun.

65
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,360
Ling Yun.

66
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,400
Let my father and mother go, please.

67
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,520
Whatever you want,

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,160
we can talk.

69
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,000
We...

70
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,600
Anning.

71
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,520
Wasn't it you

72
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,400
who said they wouldn't let us be together

73
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,560
and told me to do whatever I wanted with them?

74
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,080
No, I...

75
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,480
How can I let them go?

76
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,600
I...

77
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,600
I...

78
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,480
I was just angry.

79
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,360
They're still my parents.

80
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,200
Let them go, Dear Yun.

81
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,320
Dear Yun.

82
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,280
But if I let them go,

83
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,080
we won't be able to be together.

84
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,600
I'll persuade them.

85
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,200
I'll talk to them.

86
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,840
They'll definitely agree.

87
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,480
Okay?

88
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,320
But now I don't need their consent.

89
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,920
The entire Yan is in my hands.

90
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,800
Once I kill them,

91
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,840
you

92
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,080
and all of Yan will belong to me.

93
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,040
What are you trying to do?

94
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
Guards.

95
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,360
Light the fire.

96
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,600
Yes.

97
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,480
No!

98
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,760
Father!

99
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,480
Mother!

100
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,480
No!

101
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,280
No!

102
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,800
No!

103
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,840
Father!

104
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,880
Let go of me!

105
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,720
Let go of me!

106
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,520
Father!

107
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,880
Mother!

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,720
Mother!

109
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,200
Let go of me!

110
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,840
Anning.

111
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,280
From now on,

112
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,680
I will be the only one in this world
who loves you.

113
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,600
I will protect you

114
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,880
and guard all of Yan.

115
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,800
Ling Yun.

116
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,360
I'll kill you.

117
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,280
I will definitely kill you.

118
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,680
I can ignore everything

119
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,960
you just said.

120
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,840
If you serve me well from now on,

121
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,400
I might consider

122
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,760
granting you

123
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,360
the title

124
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,200
of my concubine.

125
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,200
Father!

126
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,520
Mother!

127
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,640
Father!

128
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,440
Mother!

129
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,000
What did I do wrong?

130
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,040
Why are you doing this to me?

131
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,160
Why destroy everything I had?

132
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,960
Why?

133
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,240
Anning.

134
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,200
You're too tired.

135
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,800
You should sleep.

136
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,040
Once you're asleep, it won't hurt anymore.

137
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,760
From now on,

138
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,480
you are me and I am you.

139
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,240
Sleep.

140
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,360
Sleep.

141
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,040
I will never become you.

142
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,600
And

143
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,240
I will kill Ling Yun.

144
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,240
What are you going to do?

145
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,000
He is the one I've fallen for.

146
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,680
I was born for him.

147
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,800
I want to marry him.

148
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,120
Dear Yun.

149
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,280
Dear Yun, don't leave me.

150
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,360
I'm willing to be your concubine.

151
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,920
You changed your mind?

152
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,440
I figured things out.

153
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,200
But there's still one thing I forgot
to tell you.

154
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,760
Tell me what?

155
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,640
I'm going to kill you!

156
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,180
(Nan Zhu, Cultivator)

157
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,720
Nan Zhu.

158
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,800
I want her destroyed.

159
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,240
Your Highness, bad news.

160
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,040
I just came from the Yan Palace.

161
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,880
And it is...

162
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What happened?

163
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
It was destroyed by Ling Yun.

164
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,960
How could that be?

165
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,380
They say

166
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,080
the princess handed over the tiger tally
to Ling Yun,

167
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,520
letting him lead troops to seize the palace.

168
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,600
To the Yan palace.

169
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,520
Mother.

170
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,000
Mother, what happened?

171
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,910
Mother, wake up.

172
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,100
Mother.

173
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,620
(Little Ling Cang)

174
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,900
(Little Ling Yun)

175
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,440
(You and I are both pitiful people
controlled by fate.)

176
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,960
Your Highness.

177
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,000
Let's go.

178
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,960
The souls of the Yan King and Queen.

179
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,040
Your Highness.

180
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,920
Forcibly gathering scattered souls

181
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,160
defies the will of Heaven.
You'll face backlash.

182
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,120
The fall of Yan

183
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,640
was never their wish.

184
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,720
Congratulations on your breakthrough,

185
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,360
becoming the only Exalted Deity
in all four realms.

186
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,080
That's all thanks to you.

187
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,840
If you hadn't taken control of everyone's fate

188
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,840
and offered all the world's fortune

189
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,480
to me,

190
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,920
I wouldn't have ascended so quickly.

191
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,240
As long as it pleases you,

192
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,440
anything I do is worth it.

193
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,640
You actually replaced Lu Anning's destined one
in this life

194
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,440
with a petty man like Ling Yun.

195
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,320
What a pleasant surprise for me.

196
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,280
Ling Cang

197
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,600
was just a pawn

198
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,360
used to confuse Lu Anning.

199
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,440
When Ling Yun finally appears,

200
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,680
a new Yan Anning will emerge.

201
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,760
She will fall deeply in love with him

202
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,080
and willingly give him her entire fortune,

203
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,180
power, and status.

204
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,080
And after that?

205
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,560
She was born for him,

206
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,560
and fate dictates she will also die
because of him.

207
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,720
Once she perishes,

208
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,880
even if Ling Yun holds an empire,

209
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,000
he will live a lifetime in regret,

210
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,600
forever mourning his lost love.

211
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,670
Good.

212
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,320
This plan is brilliant.

213
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,240
Even I can't help

214
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,320
but feel pity for Lu Anning.

215
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,400
The most widespread love stories in this world

216
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,520
are often about women sacrificing everything

217
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,480
to fulfill the dreams

218
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,120
of the men they love.

219
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,780
(Crown Prince's Residence of Ling)

220
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,400
(Xiao Wanyan, Ling Yun's Side Consort)
Dear,

221
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,960
that Yan princess

222
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,880
clearly doesn't respect you.

223
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,320
Why not just kill her already?

224
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,200
Anning.

225
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,720
How does it feel

226
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,880
to drown?

227
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,160
Anning.

228
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,760
You've suffered too much.

229
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,120
If you let me out,

230
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,920
I can change all of this.

231
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,400
Dear Yun loves me so much.

232
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,200
He will forgive us.

233
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,120
Even now,

234
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,720
you're still deluding yourself.

235
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,080
If he truly loved you,

236
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,640
why would he cause your family to be ruined?

237
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,640
Why would he turn you into a prisoner?

238
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,160
You don't even understand

239
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,640
what real love is.

240
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,880
You don't understand.

241
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,160
I was born for him,

242
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,200
fated to love him,

243
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,070
protect him,

244
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,240
and never leave him till death.

245
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,040
Everyone's destiny in this world

246
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,760
is predetermined.

247
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,080
And your fate

248
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,720
is to give everything to the man you love,

249
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,760
only to be tormented to death.

250
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,080
That man

251
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,360
will then lose his beloved forever

252
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,680
and live a life full of guilt.

253
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,880
The only way to change that

254
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,800
is to strike first and kill him.

255
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,440
(I once thought)

256
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,840
(Ling Cang was the one I had to kill
in this life.)

257
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,800
(But now it seems)

258
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,480
(that person is actually Ling Yun.)

259
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,360
(Like the protagonist in a story
being swapped out,)

260
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,520
(it was Ling Yun who was meant to die.)
