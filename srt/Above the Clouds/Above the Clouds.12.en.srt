I

9

didn't want to worry you.

By the way,

55
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,720
in the storybooks,

56
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,920
how do people usually pursue love?

57
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,260
Why do you ask?

58
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,980
I suddenly got curious and wanted to ask.

59
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,620
Are you having relationship troubles?

60
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,740
No,

61
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,740
not really.

62
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,620
It's a friend of mine.

63
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,580
A friend?

64
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,420
Oh, come on.

65
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,460
Besides Chi Xiao,

66
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,540

70
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,620
but I don't know how to start.

71
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,220
After she found out,

72
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,980
she seems to be

73
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,740
avoiding me.

74
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,500
I see.

75
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,380
You asked the right person then.

76
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,620
All those storybooks I read
weren't for nothing.

77
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,460
Don't worry, leave this to me.

78
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,420
I'll help you.

79
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,660

80
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,020

The souls of your parents are almost
fully restored.

86
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,260
the souls of Father and Mother

87
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,620
should have already entered reincarnation.

88
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,620
They would be unstable

89
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,500
and easily fade anytime

90
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,420
if not for you and Ling Cang.

91
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,900
So life is unpredictable.

00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,720
do it soon.

(Cherish the people before your eyes?)

96
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,020
I have something to do now.

97
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,860
I'll take my leave.

98
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,060
Okay.

99
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,140
How is His Highness's injury, Yao Sheng?

100
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,660
Let's go outside and talk.

101
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,020
Is it serious?

102
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,940
Tell me.

103
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,820
Yao Sheng,

104
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,420
what about Ling Cang?

105
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,860
He came to my place today.

106
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,780
I found that his injuries are quite serious.

107
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,020
He's already...

108
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,180
Already what?

109
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,580
Already...

110
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,460
Where is he now?

111
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,860
After coming to my place today,

112
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,180
he disappeared.

113
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,820
How are you?

114
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,020
Where are you hurt?

115
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,820
Is it the backlash from the Curse?

116
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,900
Or meridian damage from

117
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,020
losing the Golden Core?

118
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,380
Tell me, how can I save you?

119
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,470
- What's wrong?
- I...

120
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,380
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,940
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,300
I'm really sorry.

123
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,620
You've been hurt because of me so many times.

124
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,380
I've been careless every time.

125
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,420
Where exactly haven't you healed?

126
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,300
Tell me, I...

127
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,300
Anning.

128
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,900
I'm fine.

129
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,500
Really fine.

130
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,460
Are you sure?

131
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,740
But they said...

132
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,020
See?

133
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,780
I didn't lie to you, right?

134
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,060
Good that you're fine.

135
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,460
I was so worried.

136
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,060
Wait,

137
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,900
how could Yao Sheng

138
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,460
lie like that?

139
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,540
You care about me a lot.

140
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:41,900
Of course.

141
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,180
We're family.

142

00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,380
family?

144
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,420
Anning, I like you.

145
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,340
It's the kind of liking between a man
and a woman.

146
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,780
From the moment you ran to me
on that snowy night,

147
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,580
saying you wanted to be my family,

148
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,060
my heart was already certain

149
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,260
that the person I would spend
the rest of my life with

150
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,740
had to be you.

151
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,500

You can think about it.

155
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,620
It's late.

156
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,900

I was too nervous.

161
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,100
I was afraid that we would still

be controlled by fate afterward.

163
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,700
I got anxious,

00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,900
not knowing how to face it,

165
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,900
