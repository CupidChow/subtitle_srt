00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,940
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,080
Oh no.

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,160
Anning, be careful!

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,520
Why is he here?

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,000
Dear Yun!

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,000
Oh no, my body has been taken again!

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,960
Dear Yun, you finally came for me.

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,380
Yes.

10
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,680
So hurry and take me away.

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,160
I don't want to be apart from you ever again.

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,920
Alright.

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,720
What's going on?

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,320
Come take a look!

15
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,520
It should be safe here now.

16
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,920
Coincidentally,

17
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,280
this is where you and I first met.

18
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,920
This proves our fate is ordained by Heaven.

19
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,440
No one can separate us.

20
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,720
Tomorrow morning,

21
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,240
I will ask Father and Mother
to arrange our marriage.

22
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,280
(Her Highness never gets lovesick.)

23
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,120
Let's go.

24
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,200
(What does she really mean?)

25
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,320
(She suddenly seems like a different person.)

26
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,360
Your Highness,

27
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,720
the Crown Prince is up to his old tricks.

28
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,940
(Everyone, hide outside the city.)

29
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,760
(Snakes marked agents,
scout Yan Kingdom's defenses)

30
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,220
(and report to Cixi Tower.)

31
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,200
Secretly spying on Yan's defenses,

32
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,080
Ling Yun's plan is far from simple.

33
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,360
His visit to Yan Kingdom

34
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,600
is surely more than just marrying the princess.

35
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,000
Luckily, the princess has agreed to marry you,

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,560
otherwise, we wouldn't know
how to turn things around.

37
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,280
I don't think so.

38
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,920
She's unpredictable.

39
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,920
We shouldn't have let her go so easily today.

40
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,840
We must quickly finalize this marriage.

41
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,980
(Taiji Hall)

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,040
Father and Mother, please

43
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,480
arrange marriage for us.

44
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,600
Anning,

45
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,200
you don't know what you are doing.

46
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,680
Anning,

47
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,840
didn't you say

48
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,640
you didn't want to marry anyone?

49
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,040
I...

50
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,960
At that time, I didn't know Yun yet.

51
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,160
Yun treats me very well,

52
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,480
I love him,

53
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,240
and I want to marry him.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,760
Please grant this.

55
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,520
I will cherish Anning for life.

56
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,480
Please, Your Majesties, approve.

57
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,920
(Father and Mother, please say no.)

58
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,320
The Eldest Prince of Ling requests an audience.

59
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,120
Greetings,

60
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,480
Your Majesties.

61
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,200
Your Highness, previously,

62
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,800
in front of Ling's envoys and Yan's ministers,

63
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,240
you agreed to a marriage contract with me.

64
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,960
Now, you want to break the contract?

65
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,040
My feelings for the princess are deep.

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,720
Please help make this union happen.

67
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,080
Your Highness, have you forgotten

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,680
we already pledged

69
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,560
under the Rosy Fate Tree?

70
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,000
Yesterday, you said

71
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,800
if I caught a falling leaf

72
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,440
under the Rosy Fate Tree,

73
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,520
I would be your destined one.

74
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,240
But...

75
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,520
Why is he still keeping that leaf?

76
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,320
The Rosy Fate Tree

77
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,920
does have such a legend.

78
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,080
The fate of your mother and I
also started there.

79
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,720
That's not true!

80
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,360
This is completely fabricated.

81
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,160
The princess's maid can testify.

82
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,600
Yunrou,

83
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,080
is it true?

84
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,680
Yes, Your Majesty, it is true.

85
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,840
I dare not lie.

86
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,320
Anning,

87
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,000
as princess,

88
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,240
every word you speak

89
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,560
affects the reputation of Yan.

90
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,880
How can you casually go back on your word?

91
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,960
Father, I don't care.

92
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
I want to marry Yun.

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,800
Please, Father and Mother, allow it.

94
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,560
Your Majesties,

95
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,960
please.

96
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,520
How reckless!

97
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,440
You want to force me?

98
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,720
You won't get your wish.

99
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,560
Guards,

100
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,880
escort the princess back to her chambers.

101
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,800
Send the Crown Prince of Ling
back to the courier station.

102
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,280
No one may enter the palace without an edict.

103
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,120
Yes.

104
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,880
- I won't leave!
- Your Highness.

105
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,590
- I want to marry Yun!
- Let's go.

106
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,800
- Father!
- Your Highness, let's go!

107
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,520
Father!

108
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,200
Let go of me!

109
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,200
I want to see Yun! I want to marry him!

110
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,600
Have you had enough of this?

111
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,440
You...

112
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,840
You actually dare to push me?

113
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,680
Get lost!

114
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,400
You, some unknown person,

115
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,000
occupying Her Highness's body,

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,520
really think you're the princess?

117
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,360
You...

118
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,120
How dare you!

119
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,040
Just shut up?

120
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,960
You better behave yourself!

121
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,800
- What are you doing?
- Dear Yun!

122
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,960
Dear Yun, save me!

123
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,360
I want to see Dear Yun!

124
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,200
I...

125
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,340
Your Highness,

126
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,560
I'm very sorry.

127
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,840
I used too much force.

128
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,720
If you feel pain when you wake,

129
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,760
please don't blame me.

130
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,800
It's all her fault.

131
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,240
She's so annoying,

132
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,000
never seen anyone clingy like this.

133
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,440
According to your report,

134
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,600
this Ling Crown Prince

135
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,960
approached her

136
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,560
with ill intentions?

137
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,200
Her Highness wants to test
what he's really after,

138
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,240
so she will act the part with him.

139
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,960
But Her Highness specially instructed,

140
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,880
no matter what requests she and Ling Yun make,

141
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,880
don't agree to them.

142
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,440
Her Highness will explain everything later.

143
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,840
What is she trying to do?

144
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,120
Our daughter is grown now.

145
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,160
She has her own ideas.

146
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,400
Your Highness?

147
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,920
It's me.

148
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,200
It's really you.

149
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,960
Thank goodness.

150
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,560
I should've knocked her out earlier,

151
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,200
to get Your Highness back sooner.

152
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,240
Knocking her out

153
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,800
only treats the symptom, not the root.

154
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,760
To fundamentally fix this,

155
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
perhaps

156
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,480
she can no longer meet Ling Yun.

157
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,640
Why?

158
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,280
She appeared twice

159
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,200
because she saw Ling Yun.

160
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,200
So now we have to keep them apart for now

161
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,840
and see what happens.

162
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,560
But

163
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,560
though we dealt with that Ling Crown Prince,

164
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,760
but,

165
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,160
that eldest prince...

166
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,720
He's too strong.

167
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,320
Even without that woman

168
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,520
interfering yesterday,

169
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,200
we would've struggled to kill him.

170
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,520
We have to think long-term.

171
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,520
Your Highness, the Ling eldest prince has come.

172
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,560
He's outside asking for an audience.

173
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,400
Could it be because of what happened
in the hall today?

174
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,760
You may leave.

175
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,800
Let him in.

176
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,080
Yes.

177
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,240
Greetings, Your Highness.

178
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,710
Are you here to demand justice?

179
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,720
Your Highness cleverly

180
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,440
forced my brother out of Yan Palace.

181
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,280
That was impressive.

182
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,400
I will not marry him.

183
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,960
I will not marry you either.

184
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,720
Do you like me?

185
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,720
I guess

186
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,360
not.

187
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,240
Then why insist on marrying me?

188
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,320
You have been locked

189
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,760
in the cold palace in Ling for ten years.

190
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,880
The key ministers in the court

191
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,400
all belong to Ling Yun.

192
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,120
If you want to break through,

193
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,320
you can only seek allies outside.

194
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,600
Though Yan Kingdom is far away,

195
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,000
its military is strong,

196
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,520
and I am the only heir.

197
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,080
So you are determined to succeed.

198
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,960
That is why you keep dodging,

199
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,080
unwilling to marry me?

200
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,240
You can see it yourself,

201
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,880
my mind is malicious,

202
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,040
I only want to kill people,

203
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,440
truly a poor match.

204
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,440
Moreover, to me,

205
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,840
marriage is not the most stable ally,

206
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,800
interest is.

207
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,880
As long as we cooperate,

208
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,840
I will be your best ally.

209
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,080
But what I seek

210
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,520
is the throne of Ling Kingdom.

211
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,760
How do you plan to help me?

212
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,040
Your only opponent is Ling Yun.

213
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,040
If you are ruthless enough...

214
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,440
This is Ling Yun's deployment in Yan.

215
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,360
You only need to sweep it all up.

216
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,360
(Everyone, hide outside the city.)
Hold this leverage in your hands.

217
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,840
(Snakes marked agents, scout)
Then Yan will give my father pressure.

218
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,320
Removing the problem

219
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,840
is good for both you and me.

220
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,320
He...

221
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,720
He really takes my Yan Kingdom

222
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,800
as if it were in his pocket,

223
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
easily grasped?

224
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,120
This is his usual trick:

225
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,600
first use a self-inflicted wound
to gain sympathy,

226
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,320
then take the opportunity to deploy,

227
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,360
and finally attack the city.

228
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,720
However,

229
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,200
you are the first woman to see through him.

230
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,600
Fine.

231
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
Today I will lead the army to besiege Ling Yun.

232
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,160
But if I fail,

233
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
and he discovers you betrayed him,

234
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,440
that is treason.

235
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,080
You can't afford that.

236
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,560
The throne struggle

237
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,440
is an irredeemable gamble.

238
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,320
Since I have your help,

239
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,480
I bet I will win.

240
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,360
You trust me,

241
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,840
then I also trust you.

242
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,360
(Establishing Goodwill)
Here is an alliance treaty,

243
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,120
consider it a token of our cooperation.

244
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,280
One day,

245
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,040
when you become the emperor of Ling,

246
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,600
I hope

247
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,560
Yan and Ling can stop wars for a hundred years,

248
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,320
open trade,

249
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,240
and exchange goods.

250
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,080
You care for the world.

251
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,520
I thank you

252
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,680
on behalf of the people.

253
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,440
There is one private matter.

254
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,480
After you leave the palace today,

255
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,680
we shall never meet again.

256
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,400
You will never

257
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,400
enter Yan again in this life.

258
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,720
You are very afraid of me?

259
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,520
Why have you

260
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,680
always regarded me as a beast?

261
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,880
Princess Anning.

262
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,600
- Your Highness.
- Stay away.

263
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,680
- Your Highness.
- Stay away.

264
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,200
Can I not say it?

265
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,760
But I promise,

266
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,120
this will not affect our cooperation.

267
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,680
Once i succeed,

268
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,040
I will take fireworks as a signal.

269
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,080
Then,

270
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,600
return to your country

271
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,120
and wait for the Yan's imperial decree.

272
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,880
Sure.

273
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,000
Then I will take my leave.

274
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,960
Farewell.

275
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,920
Yunrou.

276
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,560
Your Highness.

277
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,320
Your Highness, what's wrong?

278
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,640
Why are you sweating so much?

279
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,880
If we never meet again in this life,

280
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,760
the fate of the past life
should no longer repeat, right?

281
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,040
Your Highness, what are you saying?

282
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,120
Yunrou,

283
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,920
did the secret guards catch a refugee

284
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,360
with this mark on him recently?

285
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,030
Yes, he is still held

286
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,120
in the interrogation prison.

287
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,760
Take the tiger tally,

288
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,320
come with me to the prison.

289
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,040
Before removing the problem,

290
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
let's confirm once more.

291
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:46,660
(Interrogation Prison, Yan Palace)

292
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,920
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

293
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,480
Release him.

294
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,600
Even if you release me,

295
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,600
I will not speak.

296
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,200
Your hideout in Yan at Cixi Tower

297
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,680
has been besieged by me.

298
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,360
Your crown prince

299
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,120
is writing a self-accusation now.

300
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,160
You are even less useful now.

301
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,280
Take him down. Kill him.

302
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,200
- Yes.
- Yes.

303
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,600
Impossible, impossible.

304
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,320
- Don't kill me, don't kill me!
- Move.

305
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,360
- Your Highness, that letter is true.
- Don't kill me.

306
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,880
What should we do next?

307
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,920
Deploy troops.

308
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,480
I will wipe them all out.

309
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
Your Highness, are we really leaving?

310
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,720
What if the princess is lying?

311
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,960
She cares for the people and has a great heart.

312
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,680
She would never lie about something like this.

313
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,600
There's no need to leave so hastily.

314
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,840
Why don't we stay one more night?

315
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,940
Once the agreement is made,

316
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,800
it must not be broken.

317
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,680
Moreover,

318
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,680
her trust is rare.

319
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,120
Do you think she can really overthrow
the crown prince?

320
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,740
Those women before

321
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,640
all betrayed their kin for him in the end.

322
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,750
- Anning.
- Stop talking.

323
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,320
There's nothing to explain.

324
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,240
I barely know him.

325
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,440
Now, we have more important matters
to attend to.

326
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,120
She holds great power,

327
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,320
achieving

328
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,640
what others couldn't.

329
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,480
And...

330
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,400
And what?

331
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,640
She is different from others.

332
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,560
(How is she different?)

333
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,280
(Only she can kill him.)

334
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,760
Your Highness.

335
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,920
Your Highness,

336
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,840
please let me go with you.

337
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,520
The tiger tally is with me.

338
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,320
All the city's troops obey my command.

339
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,600
I will be fine.

340
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,720
Don't worry.

341
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,480
Wait for me to return.

342
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,920
Hiya!

343
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,080
What are you doing?

344
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,680
Let me see my dear Yun.

345
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,560
You won't separate us.

346
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,440
Let me out.

347
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,720
Dear Yun!

348
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,400
Dear Yun!

349
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,240
Anning.

350
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,440
They want to kill you.

351
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
This is the tiger tally of Yan.

352
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,750
Quick,

353
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,240
deploy the troops to protect you.

354
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,280
Anning,

355
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,880
do you want to be with me forever?

356
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,320
I do.
