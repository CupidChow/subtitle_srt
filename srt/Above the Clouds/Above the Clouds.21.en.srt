00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,380
=Above The Clouds=

2
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,660
=Episode 21=

3
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,600
Why are you still here?

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,200
Didn't I tell you to leave the Divine Realm?

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,000
You saved me,

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,120
so I won't leave so easily.

7
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,600
No wonder obedient Anning

8
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,960
suddenly defied me.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,800
Turns out it was all under your instigation.

10
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,680
Demons, truly none of you are any good.

11
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,200
Sorry I'm late.

12
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,000
Get into your old bodies

13
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,040
and stop fighting.

14
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,600
Go stop Xi Yue from altering fate.

15
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,420
(Hall of Asura King, Ghost Realm)

16
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,600
This witch is exhausted.

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,910
Seize her!

18
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,280
Who dares cause trouble in my domain?

19
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,620
(Hall of Asura King)

20
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,720
The Hall of Asura King.

21
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,800
He's the ruler of the Ghost Realm,

22
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,640
the Asura King.

23
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,420
(Asura King, Ruler of the Ghost Realm)

24
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,440
What do we do?

25
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,160
We must report to His Majesty.

26
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,160
Retreat!

27
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,800
Your Majesty!

28
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,640
Save me!

29
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,280
Wait.

30
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,120
I entered the rift with Lu Anning.

31
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,280
Why am I still here?

32
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,600
Xi Yue, born in misery,

33
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,200
trained in demonic ways,

34
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,680
and was slain by Emperor Jing Yun.

35
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,520
Wait.

36
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,520
This is the Providence Vault
ten thousand years ago.

37
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,560
Yu Han.

38
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,320
No, I should call you Star Lord.

39
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,320
You were supposed to serve me,

40
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,440
nameless,

41
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,640
formless.

42
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,760
You are

43
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,800
the Fate.

44
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,280
No wonder Lu Anning succeeded
in rewriting her fate.

45
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,120
What Xi Yue said was true.

46
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,880
You've been secretly helping her all along.

47
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,640
Have you forgotten your duty?

48
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,800
It's to protect the fate of people

49
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,160
unchanged by any individual.

50
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,320
Yet for one person,

51
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,440
you broke the balance,

52
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,640
betrayed all living beings,

53
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,520
and dared to change fate. Your sins are grave.

54
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,160
I just didn't want to be your puppet.

55
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,360
What's wrong with protecting

56
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,760
the woman I love?

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,040
I cannot save you.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,840
Why not?

59
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,920
If I do,

60
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,120
I will defy the Fate

61
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,080
and die horribly.

62
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,960
No, please.

63
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,320
I'm just an ordinary Divine Attendant.

64
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,360
Even if I've erred,

65
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,110
I don't deserve this punishment!

66
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,600
Your Majesty.

67
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,160
Why do you say what you said?

68
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,280
Then think of me as cold and unfeeling.

69
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,040
Don't go!

70
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,200
No!

71
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,600
Please!

72
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,130
Please!

73
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,220
(Between Divine and Ghost Realms)

74
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,720
You will not leave so easily!

75
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,680
Anning.

76
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,960
What's wrong with you?

77
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,080
Come back to your master.

78
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,880
As long as you return,

79
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,840
I will forgive everything you've done.

80
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,160
You are wrong.

81
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,720
I'm not your disciple.

82
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,240
You truly aren't my disciple.

83
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,200
Then who are you?

84
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,160
Where have you hidden Anning?

85
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,400
He and I are both from

86
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,960
ten thousand years in the future.

87
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,960
We came here to find Xi Yue.

88
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,720
She's changed fate for herself alone,

89
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,560
but all life across the realms is now affected.

90
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,520
You are no exception.

91
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,960
What nonsense is this?

92
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,920
Just a lowly attendant,

93
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,160
how could she possibly do all that?

94
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,360
Light it!

95
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,080
This is who you became after Xi Yue
altered fate.

96
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,920
No.

97
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,880
I would never become so heartless and cruel!

98
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,240
You must let us go.

99
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,160
We need to stop Xi Yue.

100
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,280
Otherwise, everyone will suffer
the same fate again.

101
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,280
It seems he won't let us go.

102
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,360
We'll break out by force.

103
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,760
I'll allow you to leave.

104
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,160
But

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,760
you must bring Anning back unharmed.

106
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,920
Thank you.

107
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:21,300
(Hall of Asura King)

108
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,600
(I mustn't die.)

109
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,840
(I cannot die.)

110
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,560
(I killed my master,)

111
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,680
(stole his cultivation,)

112
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,760
(just to become a deity,)

113
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,480
(to escape suffering forever.)

114
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,840
(Why should I die)

115
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,880
(for just practicing demonic arts?)

116
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,920
I refuse!
