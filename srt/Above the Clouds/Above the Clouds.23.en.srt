00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,780
=Episode 23=

3
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,980
(Princess's Chamber,
Yan Kingdom Imperial Palace)

4
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,120
You're finally awake.

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,320
When did you get here?

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,600
I came early this morning.

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,720
Today is our wedding ceremony.

8
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,360
I'm so nervous I could die,

9
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,760
and yet you're still peacefully asleep.

10
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,160
Wedding ceremony?

11
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,400
Yes!

12
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,450
Now that you've returned to Yan,

13
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,560
Yan and Ling have decided to turn swords
into plowshares.

14
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,360
They'll maintain peace through this marriage.

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,950
Don't tell me you woke up

16
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,040
and forgot everything again?

17
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,960
I remember now.

18
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,840
After Ling Yun died, my old followers
came looking for me.

19
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,560
So I returned with Father and Mother
to our homeland

20
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,600
and restored the Yan Kingdom.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Today is the day I am crowned Crown Princess.

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,320
That's right.

23
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,560
Anning,

24
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,120
will you

25
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,520
marry me?

26
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,840
The ceremony's about to begin.

27
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,640
Let's go.

28
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,160
Okay.

29
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,380
(Three months later)

30
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,340
(Streets of Ling Kingdom)

31
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,440
Kind soul.

32
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,120
Please, give us some food.

33
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,840
We haven't eaten for days.

34
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,040
Xi Yue?

35
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,760
Please give us some food..

36
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,360
Yu Han?

37
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,920
How can it be you two?

38
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,680
- How...
- What?

39
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,920
Xi Yue.

40
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,760
Yu Han.

41
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,400
You

42
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,120
know these beggars?

43
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,920
Anning.

44
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,300
(Providence Vault)

45
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,320
Lu Anning.

46
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,600
I've already given you the best this world
has to offer,

47
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,990
parents alive,

48
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,340
a joyful marriage,

49
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,790
power in your hands.

50
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,600
What more do you want?

51
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,960
All these things you gave me

52
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,960
were just a cover

53
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,080
for your true ambition to manipulate the world.

54
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,760
You created that so-called Mirror of Fate

55
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,200
to strip people of their right
to choose their own destinies.

56
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,640
That's your way of deceiving the world.

57
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,760
Just like how you tortured Xi Yue and Yu Han.

58
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,600
You say fate cannot be changed,

59
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,440
but in truth, you're just taking revenge.

60
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,040
They attempted to defy fate.

61
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,000
That is a grave sin.

62
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,280
They deserved to be punished.

63
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,950
I sent them to the mortal realm

64
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,560
so they would experience its suffering

65
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,270
and return to the proper path.

66
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,960
And your so-called "proper path",

67
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,000
is it the kind where officials can set fires,

68
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,200
but commoners can't light lamps?

69
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,200
I've been far too lenient with you.

70
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,720
How dare you question me?

71
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,800
Choosing one's destiny is a right
that belongs to all beings.

72
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,360
The right to choose must be returned
to the people.

73
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,000
You and your rules should never have existed.

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,890
Insolent girl.

75
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,760
If not for me, how could you have
changed your fate?

76
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,080
Ungrateful wretch.

77
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,200
If you don't die, my change of fate
means nothing.

78
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,520
Since you reject my kindness,

79
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,020
I'll give you punishment instead.

80
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,220
(Sugarcoated Hawthorn)

81
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:32,720
What are you doing?!

82
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,560
Hit them!

83
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,560
Ling Cang!

84
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,640
Ling Cang!

85
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,540
(A Brothel in Ling Kingdom)
Pretty girl.

86
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
I'm here!

87
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,830
Don't come closer!

88
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,200
- Come here.
- Stay away.

89
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,480
I've already paid!

90
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,400
Go away!

91
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,520
Get lost!

92
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,600
I've already paid!

93
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,940
- Get away!
- Don't touch her!

94
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,000
You little brat!

95
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,560
Trying to ruin my fun?

96
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,380
(Dungeon)

97
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,200
Will you yield or not?

98
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,310
No!

99
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,640
If you won't yield,

100
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,880
then don't blame me for being ruthless.

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,800
I will not yield!

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,480
Still not giving in?

103
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,880
Then bring Ling Cang.

104
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,320
Bring him in!

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,880
What are you doing?

106
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,440
What are you going to do?

107
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,240
What are you doing?

108
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,640
What do you want?

109
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,000
You want to resist?

110
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,240
Then I'll make you watch your beloved

111
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,600
be tortured to death.

112
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,400
No!

113
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,000
I'll break every bone in his body

114
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,720
one by one,

115
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,840
until he's worse off than dead.

116
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,920
No!

117
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:01,980
No!

118
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,860
Wait!

119
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,960
Wait!

120
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,880
Wait a second!

121
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,400
I know!

122
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,840
I know how to make her submit.

123
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,360
I no longer want

124
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,320
to suffer alongside her.

125
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,960
I've had enough.

126
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,640
Just give me the best fate in the world,

127
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,120
and I'll tell you her secret.

128
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,600
What are you talking about?

129
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,080
You're clever.

130
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,440
But

131
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,760
you stood by her,

132
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,680
enduring rebirth after rebirth,

133
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,750
defying my will and trying to change fate.

134
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,600
Why should I believe you now?

135
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,760
She tried to change fate again and again

136
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,360
because her divine consciousness
kept reminding her,

137
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,200
pushing her to defy fate.

138
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,560
If you don't believe me,

139
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,560
then extract it from her and see for yourself.

140
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,800
What are you saying, Ling Cang?

141
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,240
What?

142
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,120
You're

143
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,360
willing to submit

144
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,680
so I don't have to suffer?

145
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,360
If that's not it,

146
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,760
then why make me suffer in your place?

147
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,280
Huh?

148
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,000
I really

149
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,080
trusted the wrong person.
