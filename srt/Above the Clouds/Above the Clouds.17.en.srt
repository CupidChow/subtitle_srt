3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:16,920
Anning.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,120
Anning.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,270
Looks like I came at the wrong time.

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,160
What is it?

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,560
The souls you asked me to restore,

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,480
I've completed it.

9
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,520
Father.

10
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,080
Mother.

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,280
Anning.

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,560
Anning.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,840
Mother,

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,320
I missed you so much.

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,160
Anning.

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,720
You've gotten so thin.

17
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,640
You must have suffered a lot.

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,000
As long as I can see you again,

19
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,160
no amount of suffering is too much.

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,400
You are the hope of Yan.

21
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,680
Only by staying alive

22
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,760
can you restore our kingdom.

23
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,600
Father.

24
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,120
I'm about to do something very important,

25
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,790
but also very dangerous.

26
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,560
Only if I succeed

27
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,040
can I truly revive Yan.

28
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,560
Whatever it is,

29
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,200
go do it without hesitation.

30
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,080
But

31
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,200
you must protect yourself.

32
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,520
Your Majesties, please rest assured.

33
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,680
I will do everything I can to protect her.

34
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,880
This time we owe it all to you.

35
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,400
If not for you,

36
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,140
we might never have seen Anning again.

37
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,520
Such great kindness,

38
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,280
how can it ever be repaid?

39
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,720
I didn't save you

40
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,760
for favors in return.

41
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,920
You need not feel indebted.

42
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,430
I've already received the best thanks.

43
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,200
Ling Cang.

44
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,320
He's inside me now.

45
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,300
I can no longer suppress him.

46
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,280
Hurry, crush the clay figure!

47
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,940
- Anning.
- How could I ever kill you?

48
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,920
If you won't kill me, then I'll do it myself.

49
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,760
Ling Cang!

50
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,680
No!

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,840
Ling Cang.

52
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,440
Wake up!

53
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,600
Those who dare defy fate

54
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,040
shall die.

55
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,720
Anning!

56
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,640
Your Highness.

57
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,600
We haven't caught this year's fish yet.

58
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,000
Anning!

59
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,200
Anning!

60
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,760
Anning!

61
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,280
Anning!

62
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,600
Anning!

63
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,280
Anning!

64
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,320
Why?

65
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,880
Lu Anning,

66
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,520
you're finally dead.

67
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,650
It's a pity that

68
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,840
we can't yet let Ye Sha

69
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,000
die as miserably as you did.

70
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,470
I've found clues about
the Celestial Bone Flute.

71
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,080
Soon,

72
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,560
we'll obtain it.

73
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,880
Once we have the Celestial Bone Flute,

74
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,000
we won't need Ye Sha

75
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,840
to complete Ling Yun's fate anymore.

76
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,080
Then,

77
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,780
we can kill him in agony.

78
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,560
Please save her.

79
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,480
Save them.

80
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,240
Fate has come.

81
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,680
They are dead.

82
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,200
I can't save them.

83
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,680
But Anning still has a sliver of life left.

84
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,000
Her physical body is part
of the Luminous Heart.

85
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,400
As long as you feed it with blood...

86
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,160
I'm not finished yet.

87
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,360
Even if there's only the slightest chance,

88
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,520
I'll bring her back.

89
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,800
The Luminous Heart is no ordinary artifact.

90
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,040
Even if you sacrifice all your blood,

91
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,280
it may not be enough to revive her.

92
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,680
Then what do we need now?

93
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,200
My soul or my blood?

94
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,720
You're right.

95
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,560
You must be completely free of distractions.

96
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,320
Place her into your sea of consciousness,

97
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,120
and nourish her with both blood and soul.

98
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,560
But you'll endure pain as if torn
by a thousand blades.

99
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,440
One misstep,

100
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,000
you'll be annihilated.

101
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,240
She ended up like this because of me.

102
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,920
No matter the cost,

103
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,480
I will bring her back.
