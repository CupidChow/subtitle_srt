=Episode 15=

3
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,280
Ling Cang,

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,240
you can't take anything from me.

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,400
Since we were young,

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,560
you've never been better than me.

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,120
Though we were both born of the royal family,

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,680
your life was like a weed.

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,280
I was adored,

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,240
got everything I wanted,

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,920
including your life.

12
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,560
Today I'm here

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,200
to break that destiny.

14
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,430
Just you?

15
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,520
You...

16
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,710
You lied to me.

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,240
If I didn't lie to you,

18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,960
how could I kill you?

19
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,160
You remember me now?

20
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,960
Why did you pretend not to know me just now?

21
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,240
I had no choice.

22
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,520
Anning's divine consciousness told me

23
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,240
I had to marry Ling Yun,

24
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,850
walk into the predetermined ending.

25
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,200
Anning.

26
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,960
You're...

27
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,960
I am your divine consciousness.

28
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,760
We meet again.

29
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,890
Who exactly are you?

30
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,960
Why do you appear here?

31
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,030
I was born from you,

32
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,140
Anning.

33
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,320
You have experienced lifetimes

34
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,200
of being killed by the one you love,

35
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,560
your heart unwilling,

36
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,200
your obsession unresolved,

37
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,160
always wanting to change fate.

38
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,560
I took form from that.

39
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,520
Now my appearance

40
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,440
means your fate is nearing its end.

41
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,200
The end?

42
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,120
You saw it just now.

43
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,920
Your final destiny is to marry Ling Yun

44
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,560
and be killed by him.

45
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,560
Only by killing him at that crucial moment

46
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,520
can you have a chance to change your fate.

47
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,310
So you're saying

48
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,560
I couldn't kill him before

49
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,840
because I hadn't yet reached that moment.

50
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,720
But in the previous life,

51
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,640
I did kill Ye Sha.

52
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,960
And he still turned on me in the end.

53
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,560
How do you explain that?

54
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,360
You did kill Ye Sha,

55
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,360
but later he was possessed by a certain force.

56
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,560
I don't know what that force was either.

57
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,960
We must find it

58
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,360
to know who is pulling the strings.

59
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,160
So you want me

60
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,360
to just watch you marry someone else?

61
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,640
I have no choice.

62
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,680
If I don't do this,

63
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,720
I'll lose my only chance to catch it.

64
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,440
Fine.

65
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,400
I'll help you find it.

66
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,160
Then we'll kill it together.

67
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,380
We'll change our fate together.

68
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,400
Alright.

69
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,160
Lied to me.

70
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,520
Lied to me.

71
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,940
Lied...

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,400
Lied to me.

73
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,120
In Lu Anning's 1,002nd lifetime,

74
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,800
Princess of Yan, Yan Anning

75
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,400
married into Ling Kingdom.

76
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,110
- Xi Yue!
- Eventually, at the wedding,

77
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,080
Xi Yue!

78
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,200
she killed her lover.

79
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,390
Xi Yue!

80
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,240
Lu Anning must not succeed in changing fate.

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,080
Or I...

82
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,350
I...

83
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,840
Xi Yue, don't worry.

84
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,440
I won't let anything happen to you.

85
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,600
Xi Yue,

86
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,480
wait for me.

87
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,560
He's dead.

88
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,510
Do you feel any better?

89
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,620
His worthless life

90
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,880
isn't enough to atone for all his sins.

91
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,340
Yeah.

92
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,720
He's dead,

93
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,320
but those he killed won't come back.

94
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,920
Those who dare defy fate

95
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,640
shall die.

96
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,640
He's here.

97
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,040
It really is him.

98
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,960
Anning!

99
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,920
Lu Anning!

100
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,640
Lu Anning!

101
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,600
Ling Yun, let go.

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,240
Lu Anning!

103
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,640
The Luminous Heart?

104
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,360
Why is it in you?

105
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,960
Anning.

106
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,680
Why?

107
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,440
Why must you change fate?

108
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,360
Can't you just follow your destined path?

109
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,680
Useless!

110
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,200
Please forgive me.

111
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,960
I truly didn't know

112
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,120
the Luminous Heart was in her.

113
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,080
What did you say?

114
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,280
The Luminous Heart is in her?

115
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,800
Exactly.

116
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,800
No.

117
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,760
That's impossible.

118
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,400
She had the Crimson Spirit Pearl
in a past life.

119
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,760
How could she possess the Luminous Heart
in this one too?

120
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,400
Can the world really be so coincidental?

121
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,160
Could it be fate itself

122
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,400
is playing tricks on us?

123
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,170
Fate

124
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,160
is tied to the fortune of all beings.

125
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,160
Since we control of the Providence Vault,

126
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,440
we've grasped fate itself.

127
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,080
It could not possibly act against us in secret.

128
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,120
Forget it.

129
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,160
It's just a guess of mine.

130
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,560
As for the truth,

131
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,750
you'll have to uncover it.

132
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,520
What's most urgent now

133
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,640
is to take back the Luminous Heart,

134
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,280
and stop her from altering fate again.

135
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,800
Yes.

136
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,440
Who would have thought

137
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,210
one of the four ancient divine artifacts,
the Luminous Heart,

138
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,800
would actually grow inside her.

139
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,040
Anning,

140
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,760
how do you feel?

141
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,460
The Luminous Heart has just awakened.

142
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,440
Her body might not be used to it yet.

143
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,160
Maybe she should rest more.

144
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,280
Who

145
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,390
are you?

146
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,480
You're home now.

147
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,640
You don't have to pretend.

148
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,200
Home?

149
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,920
Where?

150
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,080
What is this place?

151
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,120
You really don't remember anything?

152
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
Princess Anning,

153
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,960
do you recognize us at all?

154
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,490
You...

155
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,400
You're the Divine Physicker.

156
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,600
You actually remember me?

157
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,440
What about me?

158
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,080
You are

159
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,480
that fisher.

160
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,400
Right.

161
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,200
Then you...

162
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,000
You're...

163
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,680
You are that...

164
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,800
I don't recognize you.

165
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,320
You...

166
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,600
