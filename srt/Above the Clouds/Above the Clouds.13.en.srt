=Episode 13=

3
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,920
Your soul has fully merged with my Golden Core,

4
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,440
so why are you still dissipating?

5
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,640
What did you say?

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,960
Anning is going to dissipate?

7
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,240
It seems the Golden Core fusion plan
has failed.

8
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,000
We need to find another way.

9
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,920
Chi Xiao.

10
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,200
Go bring Yao Sheng here.

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,040
Yes.

12
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,220
(Qin Se Sheng Qing)

13
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,480
Anning,

14
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,080
are you okay?

15
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,490
Your Golden Core should have reshaped her body.

16
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,840
She shouldn't be experiencing soul dissipation.

17
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,340
How could this happen?

18
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,780
The medical texts say,

19
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,260
in a single body with two souls,

20
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,260
only one soul can survive.

21
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,260
If the original soul is pushed out,

22
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,100
the new soul must overlap
with the original soul,

23
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,420
otherwise the original soul will dissipate.

24
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,380
Is there no other way to let me live?

25
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,420
Don't worry.

26
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,780
After fusion,

27
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,180
the new soul will blend with you,

28
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,060
and what remains will be your will.

29
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,220
If the new soul dissipates,

30
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,580
you can return to your original body.

31
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,620
This is the array disc for the fusion array.

32
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,260
No.

33
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,220
Though Ning is the new soul,

34
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,420
she has independent thoughts and feelings.

35
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,540
If I forcibly fuse with her

36
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,860
against her will,

37
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,780
what's the difference between me and Ling Yun?

38
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,140
You're right.

39
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,540
But right now,

40
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,500
this is the only method I can think of.

41
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,380
We'll buy time one day at a time.

42
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,100
Please,

43
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,700
keep looking for other methods.

44
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,220
If it really doesn't work,

45
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,940
then we'll make other plans.

46
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,300
Alright.

47
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,500
(If no fusion, Anning will dissipate.)

48
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,020
(If fused, I will disappear.)

49
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,500
(Anning has been so good to me.
I don't want to lose her.)

50
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,740
There are thousands of faces,

51
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,300
but the soul is one of a kind.

52
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,700
You're still you.

53
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,460
Birthday noodles.

54
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,860
To celebrate your rebirth starting today.

55
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,620
No more being coerced.

56
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,500
From now on, you can live happily.

57
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,060
How are you? Are you alright?

58
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,340
Ning is in danger.

59
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,500
Where did she go?

60
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,580
That aura

61
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,980
belongs to Nan Zhu, that subordinate
of Ling Yun.

62
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,260
Nan Zhu?

63
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,140
Crown Prince's Mansion!

64
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,980
You're disappointed

65
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,100
that I'm still alive, right?

66
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,020
I always think about you.

67
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,300
So after leaving me,

68
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,980
have you been happy?

69
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,460
I...

70
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,380
I have.

71
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,140
They treat me well.

72
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,180
So,

73
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,340
you mean

74
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,980
I didn't treat you well,

75
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,220
made you unhappy,

76
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,340
and that's why

77
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,380
you want to stay with them?

78
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,220
Right?

79
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,620
Yun,

80
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,460
do you love me?

81
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,940
Of course I love you.

82
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,860
But you're too disobedient.

83
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,300
(Lord Zhao)
Your Highness.

84
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,140
She's truly a beauty.

85
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,060
Are you really willing to give her to me?

86
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,740
I never break my word.

87
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,500
Give me to someone else?

88
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,940
Yun,

89
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,580
is this the love you talk about?

90
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,660
You don't listen,

91
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,740
so I must punish you.

92
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,460
It's because I love you

93
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,980
that I

94
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,260
personally choose your future.

95
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,700
Can't you understand me?

96
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,020
What are you laughing at?

97
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,540
She's right.

98
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,060
You don't love me at all.

99
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,020
In your eyes,

100
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,020
I'm just something dispensable.

101
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,180
I used to think I was pitiful,

102
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,140
but now I think

103
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,020
the truly pitiful one is you.

104
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,820
The people around you

105
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,860
are all puppet shells.

106
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,620
You will never understand what true love is.

107
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,980
You don't know how to love.

108
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,060
Let go of me.

109
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,780
Let go.

110
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,540
Anning, where are you going?

111
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,500
Let go, let go of me.

112
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,460
Lord Zhao,

113
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,660
she has been brought to you.

114
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,620
Enjoy yourself.

115
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,260
Don't come near me, stay back.

116
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,080
Don't come near me, no.

117
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:53,980
Let go of me.

118
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,060
You are asking for trouble.

119
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,260
Ning,

120
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,020
how are you?

121
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:19,990
Are you alright?

122
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,900
Are you hurt?

123
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,180
What took you so long?

124
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,620
I...

125
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,180
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,060
Sorry, sorry.

127
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,980
I came too late.

128
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,420
You did well.

129
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,780
See?

130
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,540
Protecting yourself isn't that hard.

131
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,900
It's okay now.

132
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,660
It's okay.

133
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,820
Let's go.

134
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,860
Where are you going?

135
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,900
You're not dead?

136
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,980
Don't you know

137
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,300
you can't kill me?

138
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,620
It seems

139
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,900
I underestimated you.

140
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,340
So stop struggling.

141
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,620
This array was designed specifically for you.

142
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,260
You can't break it.

143
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,340
How is...

144
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,740
Don't think I have no other ways.

145
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,020
You two leave now.

146
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,060
I'll cover the rear.

147
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,100
Alright.

148
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,220
Give it to me.

149
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,420
Those who belong to me,

150
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,700
even if they die,

151
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,060
will stay by my side.

152
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,980
Anning!

153
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,380
Anning!

154
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,260
Anning!

155
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,540
Anning!

156
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,060
Anning!

157
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,020
Why?

158
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,140
Why did you take the arrow for me?

159
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,780
I don't want you

160
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,540
to die.

161
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,500
Why are you so silly?

162
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,060
It's all my fault.

163
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,100
I don't deserve this from you.

164
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,180
It's not your fault.

165
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,500
Don't blame yourself.

166
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,940
I don't want you to die.

167
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,220
I don't want you to die.
