00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,860
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,880
You...

4
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,270
Your face...

5
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,400
How did it become like this?

6
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,000
She must have had her face altered.

7
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,160
Face altered?

8
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,640
Who could be so vicious?

9
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,280
Was it Ling Yun?

10
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,360
He altered your face

11
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,080
and even got someone to insult you?

12
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,880
It wasn't arranged by Dear Yun.

13
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:07,980
Don't talk nonsense.

14
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,960
I'm talking nonsense?

15
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,240
He lied to you, hurt you,

16
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,040
and put you in this state,

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,440
and you're still defending him?

18
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,090
I really don't understand.

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,680
What is it that you love about him?

20
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,640
By doing this,

21
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,680
aren't you just debasing yourself?

22
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,560
Yes.

23
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,720
No one loves me.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,840
I'm debasing myself.

25
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,890
I've lost my purity.

26
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:31,840
Are you satisfied now?

27
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,910
I... I didn't mean...

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,920
Who asked you all to care?

29
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,840
Now that I've lost my purity,

30
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,270
Dear Yun won't want me anymore.

31
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,080
What's the point of living?

32
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,360
Might as well die.

33
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,000
Even now you're still thinking about
your Dear Yun?

34
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,640
Purity and chastity

35
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,680
are just tools men use to bind women.

36
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,200
They shouldn't even exist

37
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,560
for women in the first place.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,680
Why judge yourself by a man's standards?

39
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,600
You did nothing wrong.

40
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,840
Why are you

41
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,000
bullying yourself along with them?

42
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,960
You all...

43
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,720
You're all bullying me.

44
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,800
I just want to be with Dear Yun,

45
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,280
to marry him.

46
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,640
What did I do wrong?

47
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,440
You did nothing wrong.

48
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,000
These were all fated.

49
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,440
But

50
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,240
if you can let go of Ling Yun,

51
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,240
you can gain your freedom.

52
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,520
I can't let go.

53
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,520
I know.

54
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,600
It's hard.

55
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,080
But this is something

56
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,960
only you can do.

57
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,040
No one else can help.

58
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,440
And I believe

59
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,520
you can do it.

60
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,400
Go ahead and cry.

61
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,000
How is she now?

62
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,840
I just coaxed her to sleep.

63
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,760
That was hard.

64
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,480
She suffered so much with Ling Yun

65
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,760
and had her face changed by him.

66
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,360
She must have given up on him by now.

67
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,720
Let's hope so.

68
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,520
I thought you two would be like fire and water.

69
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,400
I was too narrow-minded.

70
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,080
I used to think

71
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,760
that when I saw her again,

72
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,200
I would want to kill her,

73
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,120
or at least punish her severely.

74
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,800
But

75
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,860
when I saw how Ling Yun had tormented her,

76
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,020
(Qin Se Sheng Qing)

77
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,880
I thought maybe

78
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,040
this wasn't her fault.

79
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,720
It was fate.

80
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,680
Because I refused to obey fate,

81
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,440
Yan Anning came into being

82
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,640
to fulfill my destined path.

83
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,280
You've already

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,480
made up your mind.

85
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,840
Think about it.

86
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,600
Everything she did,

87
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,440
she was just a child crying for candy.

88
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,520
Since she lacked love

89
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,640
and didn't understand love,

90
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,320
I'll be the one to show her.

91
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,960
Do you know what love is?

92
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,400
Love

93
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,320
is simple.

94
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,800
Anything that makes you happy is love.

95
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,620
♪Time reaches out♪

96
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,710

♪We meet again with thorns between us♪

103
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,480
What makes you happy?

104
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,920
I used to think it was sunlight and flowers,

105
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,000
pretty clothes and jewelry,

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,560
and all the sparkling things in the world.

107
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,040
And now?

108
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,680
Now I think

109
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,330
♪Take me, I whisper♪

110
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,680

By the way,

114
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,480
are you all right?

115
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,440
I mean the backlash.

116
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,440
♪So we fight the sky♪

117
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,960
I'm fine.

118
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,960
You don't have to worry.

119
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,760
Ever since you appeared,

120
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,240
you've only had Ling Yun on your mind.

121
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,400
But in this world,

122
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,840
there are many things more interesting

123
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,240
and more worthy of love than Ling Yun.

124
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,340
Miss, come take a look.

125
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,320
Take a look.

126
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,640
See if there's anything you like.

127
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,920
A floral umbrella.

128
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,400
This one is really pretty.

129
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,200
It's the color we both like.

130
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,080
Who said I like it?

131
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,440
How would you know if you don't try?

132
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,800
Let me put it on for you.

133
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,600
Don't touch my face.

134
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,120
Even though he altered your face,

135
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,200
you're

136
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,120
still you.

137
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,320
There are thousands of faces,

138
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,920
but the soul is one of a kind.

139
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,800
If you don't like it, forget it. Let's go.

140
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,760
Wait.

141
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,600
If there's something I want,

142
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,680
you'll buy it for me?

143
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,520
Yes.

144
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,560
This one.

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,360
This one, this one.

146
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,320
This one.

147
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,280
And this one.

148
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,480
I don't want these.

149
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
I'll take all the others.

150
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,520
All right.

151
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,480
Let's go check out the next stall.

152
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,200
Sir, wrap up everything

153
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,960
except this one and this one.

154
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,000
Keep the change.

155
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,480
Thank you, sir.

156
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,480
Miss, check out this.

157
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,680
Thank you, miss.

158
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,800
(They could actually hurt me this badly.)

159
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,400
(If not for the fate protecting me,)

160
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,440
(this time,)

161
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,880
(I really might have died.)

162
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,600
Here is the Blaze Bow you wanted.

163
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,280
Good.

164
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,680
Put it there.

165
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,840
What's the current situation outside?

166
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,800
They only know

167
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,000
that Your Highness vanished without reason.

168
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,820
His Majesty has increased manpower,

169
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,120
searching the whole city for you.

170
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,320
As for Ling Cang and Princess Anning,

171
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,680
there hasn't been any movement.

172
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,600
They probably don't know you survived
the Curse.

173
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,060
Stay put and wait for an opportunity.

174
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,700
When the time comes,

175
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,340
bring that girl back to me.

176
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,580
This is...

177
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,940
Birthday noodles.

178
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,140
To celebrate your rebirth starting today.

179
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,460
No more being coerced.

180
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,180
From now on, you can live happily,

181
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,620
do whatever you want,

182
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,300
go after what you want.

183
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,820
No more fear or anxiety.

184
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,340
Eat.

185
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,780
Eat while it's hot.

186
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,220
Does it taste good?

187
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,620
Anning.

188
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,460
You're here.

189
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,700
Who do you think you are?

190
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,740
You don't deserve to have this face.

191
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,220
There's one more thing I haven't told you.

192
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,540
Starting today,

193
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,780
you are Yan Anning.

194
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,300
Then...

195
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,490
What about you?

196
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,330
Me?

197
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,860
I've always had my own name.

198
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,780
I'm called Lu Anning.

199
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,100
Our family names

200
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,700
have never been the same.

201
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,940
Lu Anning?

202
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,540
Yes.

203
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,220
From now on,

204
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,900
you call me Anning,

205
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,420
and I'll call you Ning.

206
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,260
How about that?

207
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,540
Okay.

208
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,300
Anning.

209
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,660
Anning.

210
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,380
Then let's release sky lanterns.

211
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,020
I heard they can carry wishes to the gods.

212
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,860
So before releasing them,

213
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,860
why not write your wishes on them?

214
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,900
Ning, what wish do you have?

215
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,740
I'll write it for you.

216
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,660
I...

217
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,860
I want to live well.

218
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,340
Okay.

219
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,060
What about you?

220
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,140
My wish is you...

221
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,300
The paper's so small.

222
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,980
Can it fit?

223
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:52,860
I...

224
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,940
It really is a bit too small.

225
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,070
Then

226
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,700
I wish everyone

227
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,220
peace and joy,

228
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,420
health and good fortune,

229
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,930
that all we think of comes true,

230
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,250
and all we wish for is granted.

231
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,340
(Peace and joy. Wishes come true.)

232
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,940
All right.

233
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,900
