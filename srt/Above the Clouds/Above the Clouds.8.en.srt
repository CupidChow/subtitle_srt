=Episode 8=

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,320
Your Highness.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,320
The account book has been stolen.

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,480
Aside from my dear brother,

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,880
who else could break the array?

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,000
Your Highness.

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,000
Your Highness.

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,200
Your Highness.

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,560
Please come in.

11
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,800
Father.

12
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,280
Mother.

13
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,240
Why are their souls

14
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,320
with you?

15
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,520
When that disaster happened,

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,200
I rushed over

17
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,440
but could only save their lingering souls.

18
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,760
Though Yao Sheng is preserving them with magic,

19
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,200
whether they can survive

20
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,840
is still uncertain.

21
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,920
Their souls are not yet restored,

22
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,720
so they cannot stay for long.

23
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,680
It's alright.

24
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,000
It's alright.

25
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,640
Just seeing them

26
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,920
is enough.

27
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,760
Your Highness.

28
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,560
Whether you wish for revenge

29
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,320
or to save your parents,

30
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,640
live well.

31
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,440
Everything is still possible.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,960
Ling Cang.

33
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,880
Thank you

34
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,200
for giving me back my family.

35
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,960
How shall I repay you?

36
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,160
I saved them

37
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,980
not to earn your gratitude.

38
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,600
So,

39
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,680
don't dwell on it, Your Highness.

40
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,520
I must dwell on it.

41
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,720
From now on,

42
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,040
just call me Anning.

43
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,510
Your Highness.

44
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,760
A palace eunuch has arrived with a decree.

45
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,520
Anning.

46
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,940
His Majesty has issued an order

47
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,080
summoning Prince Ling Cang

48
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,200
to the Crown Prince's residence at once.

49
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,560
I accept the decree.

50
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,040
I'll go over.

51
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,760
You stay here and guard the house.

52
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes.

53
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,940
(Qin Se Sheng Qing)

54
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,360
It's already

55
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,120
this late. Why isn't

56
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,160
His Highness back yet?

57
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,120
The King has always ignored His Highness,

58
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,280
but now suddenly wants to see him

59
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,400
and at the Crown Prince's residence no less.

60
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,480
It can't be anything good.

61
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,400
What do you mean?

62
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,280
His Highness has never been favored
by the King.

63
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,120
Those accusations spread outside

64
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,120
actually weren't His Highness's doing.

65
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,160
His Majesty, to protect another son,

66
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,400
pushed all the blame onto him.

67
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,680
Mother.

68
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,160
Mother, what happened?

69
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,400
Mother, wake up.

70
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,080
Father, he wants to kill me

71
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,280
to help his son take the position
of Crown Prince.

72
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,080
I... I resisted,

73
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,960
and accidentally...

74
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,540
(King of Ling)

75
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,400
Father.

76
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,780
Ling Yun killed Mother.

77
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,750
She's still warm.

78
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,400
Please save her.

79
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,640
Father.

80
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,960
No matter how he defended himself,

81
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,240
no one believed him.

82
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,230
They said he murdered his own mother,

83
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,600
called him a demon of Asura.

84
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,360
Yes.

85
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,360
You believed that baseless,
ridiculous rumor too.

86
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,640
I...

87
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,640
I'm sorry.

88
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,440
You should say that to His Highness,

89
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,560
not to me.

90
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,640
But,

91
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,720
seeing as you helped His Highness
retrieve the account book,

92
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,120
and confirmed the Crown Prince's crimes,

93
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,360
with solid evidence,

94
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,600
leaving the King no room to protect him,

95
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,240
I'll forgive you.

96
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,000
Hey.

97
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,000
What's wrong?

98
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,140
(Ling Yun's Study)

99
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,720
Come.

100
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,600
Cang.

101
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,040
You must save your younger brother.

102
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,840
Father.

103
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,880
There's no need to plead for me.

104
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,760
He stole the account book.

105
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,160
He never intended for me to live.

106
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,480
Nonsense.

107
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,720
Cang,

108
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,960
you wouldn't,

109
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,080
right?

110
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,120
What do you mean by that?

111
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,440
Are you protecting him again?

112
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,000
Then what do you mean?

113
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,440
To throw your brother out,

114
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,000
strip him of the Crown Prince's title,

115
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,400
and make sure he can never lift his head again?

116
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,240
Then what about his private brothel,

117
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,680
his abuse of innocent girls, his manipulation

118
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,960
of court officials,

119
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
his use of power for personal gain?

120
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,760
Does none of that matter to you, Father?

121
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,600
He's endangering the foundation of Ling,

122
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,640
harming its people.

123
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,230
Can you really not see that?

124
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,980
(Account Book)

125
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,840
Brother,

126
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,120
do you really want me dead?

127
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,760
Brother.

128
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,040
Don't think I don't know your ambition.

129
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,920
You want to take his place.

130
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,080
In that case,

131
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,900
let's start with this account book.

132
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,980
(Account Book)

133
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,240
Issue my decree.

134
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,720
The Eldest Prince, Ling Cang, has established
a private brothel,

135
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,320
harmed young girls,

136
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,800
oppressed the people,

137
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,240
and colluded with officials.

138
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,640
His crimes are grave and unforgivable.

139
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,400
Throw him into the prison.

140
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,760
You...

141
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,800
You unfilial son!

142
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,440
What are you going to do?

143
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,720
Are you going to harm your own father?

144
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,400
Father,

145
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,840
Ling Yun killed Mother.

146
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,680
Silence!

147
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,280
You're crying and shouting over some

148
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,520
foreign woman who knows sorcery.

149
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,720
Do you want the whole world
to condemn your brother?

150
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,840
So young, yet already this cruel.

151
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,760
You truly chill my heart.

152
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,280
Guards,

153
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,520
expel this matricidal traitor from the palace.

154
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,280
Without my order,

155
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,440
he is not to return.

156
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,200
Father!

157
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,040
Please save her!

158
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,970
Father!

159
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:50,440
Save my mother!

160
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,120
Father!

161
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,780
Father!

162
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,880
Father!

163
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,280
Have you ever treated me as your son?

164
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,320
Do you

165
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,120
acknowledge your crime?

166
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,080
(You're not my father.)

167
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,640
(You're only his father.)

168
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,560
(And I'm not your son.)

169
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,240
(I am your)

170
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,000
(enemy.)

171
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,920
I admit guilt.

172
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,280
Do with me as you please.

173
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,720
But from this day forth,

174
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,440
you and I are merely ruler and subject,

175
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,680
no longer father and son.

176
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,760
You sever your own blood ties,

177
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,160
disregard brotherhood.

178
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,360
I have no need for a son like you.

179
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,480
Since you've confessed,

180
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,000
then go kneel outside.

181
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,200
No!

182
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,840
Kneel in the streets!

183
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,800
Let the people see how heartless
and disobedient you are

184
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,240
toward your own father.

185
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,960
I, Ling Cang,

186
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,340
bid farewell to you, Father.

187
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,680
Beat him one hundred lashes.

188
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,360
Punish him for his disobedience.

189
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,520
No magic allowed for protection.

192

Ling Cang, First Prince of Ling,

193
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,840
has committed the heinous crime

194
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,480
