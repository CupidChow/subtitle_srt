=Above The Clouds=

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,980
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,640
Yunrou, I told you,

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,600
don't pick wildflowers.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,960
Don't pick up strange men either.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,520
Or at best, you'll suffer
physically and emotionally.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,200
At worst, your entire clan will be wiped out.

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,880
Yunrou, come here and help me.

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,400
Aren't we supposed to go find
the Prince of Ling?

10
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,840
What Prince of Ling?

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,040
He's nearly dead.

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,000
Hurry over and help me.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,600
What if he has bad intentions?

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,000
He...

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,520
he's so handsome,

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,640
and he looks so pitiful.

17
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,280
How could he be a bad person?

18
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,200
Just come help already.

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,960
Yes.

20
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,320
Yunrou.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,840
This...

22
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,080
You two...

23
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,320
Yunrou!

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,560
Stop!

25
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,000
This is my bedchamber.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,560
How can you bring some random man in here?

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,480
Get

28
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,440
out...

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,520
Yunrou, quickly,

30
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,600
go bring back the best imperial physician.

31
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,640
Yes.

32
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,080
Yunrou, I'm telling you.

33
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,520
What's going on here?

34
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,000
Aren't I in my own body?

35
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,160
What are you doing?

36
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,240
You just met him today,
and you're undressing for him?

37
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,640
Who are you?

38
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,560
Don't be afraid. I'm the Princess of Yan.

39
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,440
I'm the Princess, okay?

40
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,080
Princess of Yan?

41
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,400
Anning?

42
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,000
He... he knows.

43
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,240
He must have an ulterior motive
for approaching me.

44
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,880
He must not be allowed to stay.

45
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,520
You know me?

46
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,440
It seems

47
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,480
we truly are fated by the heavens.

48
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,520
Get a grip, will you?

49
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,440
This is a scam! A trap!

50
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,080
How can I ever repay you for saving my life?

51
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,880
I don't even know your name yet.

52
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,240
My humble surname is Yun.

53
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,000
Yun?

54
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,200
Dear Yun,

55
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,480
I've fallen for you

56
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,960
at first sight.

57
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,200
Can you marry me?

58
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,240
You've known him for half a day,

59
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,960
spoken fewer than ten sentences,

60
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,320
and the first time you saw him,

61
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,240
you didn't even get a clear look at his face.

62
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,960
How could you have fallen for him
at first sight?

63
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,080
Do you know his full name?

64
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,240
Where he lives? Who he is?

65
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,280
Do you know that?

66
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,960
Why was he targeting me in the Ghost Market?

67
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,720
How can you say you've fallen for him

68
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,480
and want to pledge yourself to him for life?

69
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,680
Have you been cursed or something?

70
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,080
Get out of my body right now!

71
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,880
Give me my body back!

72
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,280
I'm happy to.

73
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,840
Slow down, slow down.

74
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,600
Don't worry, Dear Yun.

75
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,440
It's fine.

76
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,040
You just focus on recovering.

77
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,240
Once you're better,

78
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,600
I'll have Father and Mother
arrange our marriage.

79
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,000
Alright.

80
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,360
If Father and Mother find out,

81
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,440
they'll die of anger, you idiot.

82
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,040
No.

83
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,240
I have to find a way to get back into my body.

84
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,520
I can't let her invite a wolf
into the house like this.

85
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,340
(Lu Anning's Sea of Consciousness)

86
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,280
So I've entered my sea of consciousness.

87
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,160
Why am I suddenly here?

88
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,200
Outsiders aren't allowed in here.

89
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,240
How can you...

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,920
That's right.

91
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,160
I am you.

92
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,600
I'm Yan Anning.

93
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,600
No.

94
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,360
You absolutely cannot be me.

95
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,680
If you were me,

96
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,240
you'd always remember your duty
as heir to the throne.

97
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,680
How can you save some shady man like him?

98
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,440
He's not just some random man.

99
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,480
He's my destined one.

100
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,320
I was born for him.

101
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,640
I will marry him.

102
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,720
For your own selfish desires,

103
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,240
you're risking the safety
of the entire Yan Kingdom.

104
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,600
You're not fit to be crown princess.

105
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,760
Get out of my body.

106
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,320
Give me my body back.

107
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,960
I will drive him out of Yan

108
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,000
and banish him forever.

109
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,000
Don't even think about it.

110
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,800
No one can separate us.

111
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,560
Since Heaven has given me this body,

112
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,560
I will not let you bully him.

113
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
My body answers to me alone.

114
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,760
You fool,

115
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,880
get out of my body now!

116
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,440
I'm back!

117
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,480
I'm back!

118
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,400
Your Highness,

119
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,080
Physician Zhang has arrived.

120
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,960
Yunrou,

121
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,000
have Physician Zhang return first.

122
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,040
You may come in.

123
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,960
Yes.

124
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,720
Your Highness, you are...

125
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,640
Taking him to the interrogation prison

126
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,080
to find out his name, origin, and identity.

127
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,280
Then why did you bring him back yesterday?

128
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,360
The one who brought him back wasn't me.

129
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,640
When he appeared,

130
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,760
another person took over my body

131
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,960
and did all sorts of strange things.

132
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,800
So,

133
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,680
I suspect he has evil magic on him.

134
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,160
Have them investigate carefully.

135
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,120
I see.

136
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,520
No wonder you seemed like a different person.

137
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,000
If I say anything about love again,

138
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,560
don't believe it at all.

139
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,090
Yes.

140
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,480
I'll have the guards lock him up right away.

141
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,560
Your Highness,

142
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,280
the Eldest Prince of Ling is here.

143
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,080
Please go with me to request marriage.

144
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,480
You came early.

145
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,360
Since you are already here,

146
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,240
let's go witness our fate beneath
the Rosy Fate Tree now.

147
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,840
Aren't we supposed to meet
your father and mother?

148
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,640
It's Yan's tradition

149
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,480
for newlyweds to witness their fate
at the Rosy Fate Tree.

150
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,640
Of course, we must go too.

151
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,480
Let's go.

152
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,080
What's wrong?

153
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,760
You don't want to go?

154
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,280
The Princess's invitation must be honored,

155
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,640
but

156
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,800
when will we request marriage?

157
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,520
Yunrou.

158
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,640
Your Highness, the marriage agreement is ready.

159
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,720
We will present it to Their Majesties soon.

160
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,520
May we go, Your Highness?

161
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,360
Why is my brother in your bedchamber?

162
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,200
Your brother?

163
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,880
Don't you know?

164
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,640
He is the Crown Prince of Ling Kingdom,

165
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,280
Ling Yun.

166
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,780
(Ling Yun, Ling Kingdom Crown Prince)

167
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,600
(He hid his identity and approached me.)

168
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,800
(He truly has bad intentions.)

169
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,440
Then why were you in the Ghost Market?

170
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,160
I was ambushed on the way to Yan Kingdom.

171
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,080
I woke up and didn't know where I was.

172
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,640
Fortunately, Princess Anning

173
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,040
saved my life.

174
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,400
Princess Anning is my savior.

175
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,760
We agreed to request her parents

176
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,600
to arrange our marriage.

177
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,000
T-This is...

178
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,640
Your savior?

179
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,080
Marriage?

180
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,120
And he's tied up?

181
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,400
I...

182
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,560
This is just our fun.

183
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,480
Mind your own business.

184
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,520
Don't talk nonsense.

185
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,520
No, it's not like that.

186
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,520
Your Highness, shouldn't you explain clearly?

187
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,870
I...

188
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,750
Anning.

189
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,920
Stop talking.

190
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,480
There's nothing to explain.

191
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,320
I barely know him.

192
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,640
Now,

193
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,760
we have more important matters to attend to.

194
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,040
Let's go.

195
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,320
Ling Cang,

196
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,880
how dare you treat me like this?

197
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,680
I am the Crown Prince.

198
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,440
By royal tradition,

199
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
the crown prince's position is rightfully mine.

200
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,880
I will take it back.

201
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,640
Let...

202
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,640
Let me go!

203
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,040
What do you want?

204
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,600
I'll agree to anything.

205
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,000
Your magic is useless against me.

206
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,480
I am the child protected by Heaven.

207
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,200
You cannot hurt me.

208
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,840
(She could actually hurt Ling Yun.)

209
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,560
Let's go.

210
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,080
If we're late, we'll miss the sunset.

211
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,820
(Rosy Fate Woods, Ghost Market)

212
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,440
Here it is.

213
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,480
How do we verify?

214
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,960
We both stand beneath the tree together.

215
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,320
If a leaf falls into our hands,

216
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,960
it proves we are each other's

217
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,200
destined ones.

218
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,360
(Seriously?)

219
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,240
Show me if this is a Rosy Fate leaf.

220
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,000
It is a Rosy Fate leaf.

221
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,440
Looks like there's some fate between us
after all.

222
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,240
(Oh no.)

223
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,600
(Where's the array disc?)

224
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,600
Your Highness,

225
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,880
Her Highness asked me to deliver...

226
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,720
Her Highness's array disc?

227
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,000
How did it end up with you?

228
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,240
Oh no!

229
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,840
There's an ambush!

230
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,720
I'm scared.

231
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,600
I'll protect you.

232
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,600
Bloodrain Slaughter Array,

233
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,960
activate!

234
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,120
(You're really skilled.)

235
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,720
(You must die today.)
