1
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,940
=Above The Clouds=

2
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,780
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,720
Hey, we meet again.

4
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,120
Nether Judge.

5
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,520
Your Highness.

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,480
What brings you here?

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,520
I need a way

8
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,000
to remove the soul that's taken over this body.

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,840
There's a way, of course.

10
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,400
But you know

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,120
my rules.

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,080
I'll pay you five times more

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,030
once it's done.

14
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,160
Alright.

15
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,910
Your Highness, please.

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,960
The princess's body houses two souls:

17
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,320
one is her original soul,

18
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,200
the other is the newer one.

19
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,120
I will use Soul Separation Technique

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,320
to extract the new soul.

21
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,600
Once removed, it will naturally dissipate.

22
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,840
But I need your help

23
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,960
to set up the Soul Guarding Array

24
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,800
to protect the original soul
during the process.

25
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,280
Sure.

26
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,640
You soulless puppet,

27
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,640
get out of my body!

28
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,240
No!

29
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,000
I won't!

30
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,160
No way!

31
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,280
I have to marry Dear Yun!

32
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,700
I can't die!

33
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,400
I can't die!

34
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,240
I can't die!

35
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,650
(The Voice Incantation isn't on her.)

36
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,550
(She's not Anning.)

37
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,560
Anning!

38
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,960
Anning!

39
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,040
Anning!

40
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,080
Why did the original soul
get pulled out instead?!

41
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,000
How should I know?

42
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,040
I clearly aimed to extract the new soul!

43
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,840
Is there any other way
to save the original soul?

44
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,040
Right now, the only way

45
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,200
is to give her a new body, fast.

46
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,520
But her spirit is unusually weak.

47
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm afraid we don't have time

48
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,230
to find another body.

49
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,160
Then I'll use my golden core to form one.

50
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,000
Your golden core?

51
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,320
That's the foundation of a cultivator.

52
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,200
Your body and core have long since become one.

53
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,480
If you use your core to recreate her body,

54
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,560
you'll be consumed in return.

55
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
Your meridians and soul will be damaged.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,920
You'll only be able to use divine power

57
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,920
when in close proximity to her.

58
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,160
- Your golden core.
- Shut up and help me.

59
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,760
Someone's breaking in!

60
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,570
Your Highness!

61
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,560
We detected Yan Anning's aura inside,

62
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,560
but there's an array!

63
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,020
Dear Yun!

64
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,720
Dear Yun!

65
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,720
Dear Yun!

66
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
Let's retreat for now.

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,840
Dear Yun!

68
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,280
Dear Yun, it really is you!

69
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,280
I knew you wouldn't abandon me!

70
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,000
I haven't seen you for so long.

71
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,280
I missed you so much!

72
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,240
What took you so long?

73
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,960
I...

74
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,860
Anning,

75
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,640
tell me everything that's happened lately.

76
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,680
After I woke up...

77
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,900
(In Lu Anning's 1002nd lifetime,)

78
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,100
(Yan Anning married Prince of Ling,)

79
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,140
(who killed her and her entire clan.)

80
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,160
Xi Yue.

81
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,160
She's trying to alter fate again.

82
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,880
Please don't worry.

83
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,240
Once her soul separates from the body,

84
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,680
she won't live long.

85
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,120
Then,

86
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,680
the new soul will take her place,

87
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,500
fulfilling her destined end.

88
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,460
(He killed her and her entire clan.)

89
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,020
What the princess said is true.

90
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,100
She treated you coldly before

91
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,980
because her body was being controlled.

92
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,060
Your brother took her to the Ghost Market

93
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,780
to help that original soul retake the body,

94
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,220
but instead, he expelled it.

95
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,740
The original soul

96
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,700
is gone now.

97
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,420
We couldn't detect any trace of it
in the chamber.

98
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,500
Gone?

99
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,780
And what about Ling Cang?

100
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,340
He escaped again?

101
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,140
Please forgive me.

102
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,420
Dear Yun!

103
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,540
Forget about them!

104
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,860
From now on, you'll have me by your side.

105
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,340
Now that I've taken my body back,

106
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,580
I'll never be like her.

107
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,020
She only disobeyed you,

108
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,980
made you angry.

109
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,900
But I love you.

110
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,660
Anning.

111
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,180
Come here.

112
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,900
Anning.

113
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,820
Who do you think you are?

114
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,060
You don't even

115
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,380
deserve to have this face.

116
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,260
Dear Yun,

117
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,860
why do I look like this?

118
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,140
That's to keep Ling Cang from finding you.

119
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,740
What's wrong?

120
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,820
Don't like this face?

121
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,460
No.

122
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,500
It's not that.

123
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,660
If you like it,

124
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,300
then I like it too.

125
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,820
Good.

126
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,140
Your Highness.

127
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,420
How is she now?

128
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,460
Her condition's relatively stable.

129
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,140
To help her wake,

130
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,570
just nourish her with some herbal meals.

131
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,660
I'll go prepare the ingredients.

132
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,430
Chi Xiao,

133
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,220
how did Anning and I make it back here?

134
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,380
It was Nether Judge
who brought you two back.

135
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,220
He even charged me
an extra hundred taels of gold,

136
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,020
said it was for travel expenses and labor.

137
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,380
So stingy, right?

138
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,260
Why didn't he bring back Anning's body?

139
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,780
I heard Ling Yun showed up.

140
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,260
He had to take you two and leave.

141
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,780
There was no time to retrieve her body.

142
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,140
Go find out
where Anning's body is now.

143
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,400
Yes!

144
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,540
How's it looking?

145
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,300
You two are recovering well.

146
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,300
The fusion between Anning
and your golden core is stable.

147
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,860
She can even draw power from the core
to use magic.

148
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,780
That's thanks to Yao Sheng's
special medicinal recipes.

149
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,940
And the matter I asked you to look into?

150
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,220
Yes, Your Highness.

151
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,420
I've confirmed,

152
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,260
Ling Yun took the princess's body.

153
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,940
Should we try to get it back?

154
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,080
No.

155
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,550
We'll just kill Ling Yun.

156
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,860
My body will return naturally.

157
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,740
Alright.

158
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,740
Then I'll help you.

159
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,760
Nan Zhu,

160
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,180
you're finally here.

161
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,540
His Highness

162
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,020
has been waiting for you inside.

163
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,220
Madam.

164
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,620
What are you doing here?

165
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,780
I came looking for His Highness,

166
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,660
but he kicked me out.

167
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,500
He said he had business
to discuss with you.

168
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Go on in now.

169
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,460
His Highness is in there?

170
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,220
Rest assured, Madam.

171
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,260
I've secretly activated

172
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,140
Xiangyun Pavilion's Lust-inducing Array.

173
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,980
Any cultivator below the Golden Core stage

174
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,140
won't be able to resist.

175
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,780
Dear Yun.

176
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,140
(Oh no, it's a trap.)

177
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,620
Nan Zhu.

178
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,620
How's the reopening of
Xiangyun Pavilion going?

179
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,340
Nan Zhu isn't with him.

180
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,020
We can skip trying to lure Nan Zhu out.

181
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,700
Nan Zhu.

182
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,780
Anning?

183
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,220
You're still alive?

184
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,020
Did you think

185
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,220
I'd die before you?

186
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,860
You've committed countless crimes:

187
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,060
seizing Yan,

188
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,900
murdering my parents and Yunrou,

189
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,260
oppressing the people of Ling.

190
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,060
Today, I will act

191
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,020
in Heaven's name to rid the world of you.

192
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,900
I adore you even more like this.

193
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,580
To die by your hand,

194
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,820
I have no regrets.

195
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,460
Enough with the nonsense!

196
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,020
Why did you use the Soul-Shattering Spell?

197
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,260
This array

198
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,140
may completely destroy his soul,

199
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,700
but it'll backlash on the caster too.

200
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,340
And you don't have your golden core
to protect you!

201
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,180
I'm fine.

202
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,220
The Soul-Shattering Curse

203
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,220
completely annihilates both soul and body.

204
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,300
Only then

205
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,180
can we sever any chance
of his resurrection.

206
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,340
(Is it really over?)

207
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,540
(Everything went so smoothly.)

208
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:57,680
Let's go.

209
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,860
Help! Don't touch me!

210
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,220
Help!

211
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,460
Let go of me!

212
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,300
Don't touch me!

213
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,020
Miss?

214
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,180
Are you alright?

215
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,820
Miss.

216
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,350
She's likely affected
by the lust formation.

217
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,370
It's so hot.

218
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,940
She is...

219
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,420
Feeling better?

220
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,500
We should leave this place immediately.

221
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,380
I've always found him annoying.

222
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,020
He's always by His Highness's side.

223
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,620
It's just outrageous.

224
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,900
Your plan may have been a bit underhanded,

225
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,660
but it sure can eliminated

226
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,660
both Yan Anning and Nan Zhu.
