00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,660
=Above The Clouds=

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,780
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,660
(Reincarnation of Ye Sha)
Eldest Prince of Ling, Ling Cang,

4
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,200
along with the Ling Kingdom's envoys,

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,200
pays respects to King and Queen of Yan.

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,000
Princess Anning.

7
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,200
Anning,

8
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,400
your true heart

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,240
is the most precious thing in the world.

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,720
I will never betray you in this life.

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,680
Those who dare defy fate

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,680
shall die.

13
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,800
- Anning.
- Your Highness.

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,240
- Your Highness.
- Stay away.

15
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,360
Were those

16
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,280
(memories from a past life?)

17
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,560
Anning,

18
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,200
are you alright?

19
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,520
Mother.

20
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,920
If you cannot change your fate,

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,400
soon

22
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,880
you will be killed by the one you love most,

23
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,320
your entire clan will be exterminated.

24
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,800
Please don't scare me.

25
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,040
(Did I fail to change my fate?)

26
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,840
(So Father and Mother)

27
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,640
(were reincarnated with me?)

28
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,600
(And Ye Sha became Ling Cang?)

29
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,080
Has something on me

30
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,200
frightened you?

31
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,680
(In this life,)

32
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,680
(will he kill me again?)

33
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,280
Anning.

34
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,920
I...

35
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,000
just felt a sudden panic.

36
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,160
Sorry about that.

37
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,880
Prince of Ling, it seems

38
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,480
you and my daughter truly lack fate.

39
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,600
There's no need for this marriage.

40
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,040
Your Majesty, since you believe in fate,

41
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,000
you must also know

42
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,640
that all fate is heaven's will.

43
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,840
How can it be severed so lightly?

44
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,320
Her Highness's demeanor

45
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,720
has left a deep impression on me.

46
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,600
Could this not be

47
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,120
a different kind of destiny?

48
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,440
I understand

49
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,800
your concerns.

50
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,040
If you agree,

51
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,400
I will

52
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,280
marry into

53
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,840
the Yan Kingdom,

54
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,720
to solidify the alliance
between our two nations.

55
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,240
That's a good idea.

56
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,840
That is a fine idea.

57
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,400
It is a great solution.

58
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Yes.

59
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,920
Your Highness,

60
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,880
what say you?

61
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,480
(Ye Sha,)

62
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,400
(in this new life,)

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,560
(you should not have come to Yan)

64
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,080
(much less provoked me.)

65
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,480
Since you are so sincere,

66
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,640
I should not reject your kind intentions.

67
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,400
However, I vowed in my youth

68
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,960
that I would marry the strongest man
in the world.

69
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,600
I wonder if you

70
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,200
would be willing to compete against
our four great warriors?

71
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,720
Anning,

72
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,160
the four great warriors are fierce.

73
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,040
The Prince must be tired from travel.

74
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,600
How could he fight?

75
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,480
Your Majesty,

76
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,360
my desire to marry Her Highness is sincere.

77
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,960
Naturally, I am willing to compete.

78
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,160
I've heard that the Princess is highly skilled.

79
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,760
Might I request

80
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,280
a match with her as well?

81
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,680
Very well.

82
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,040
But since we are to compete,

83
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,360
for the sake of peace between our kingdoms,

84
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,480
I ask the envoys present to serve as witnesses.

85
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,800
In this match,

86
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,840
regardless of whether the Prince
lives or dies,

87
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,440
it will have nothing to do with Yan.

88
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,480
And the same applies in reverse.

89
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,340
(Chi Xiao, Ling Cang's guard)

90
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,040
No problem.

91
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,340
(Yan Kingdom Water Dungeon)

92
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Your Highness,

93
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,480
the dungeon is narrow.

94
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,480
To avoid affecting your match,

95
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,040
we will wait outside.

96
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,280
Whoever walks out of the water dungeon

97
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,200
wins.

98
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,920
Please.

99
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,170
Your Highness.

100
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,080
Don't come any closer.

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,200
(He doesn't dare hurt me.)

102
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,840
(That makes things easier.)

103
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,280
Pour the blazing oil in.

104
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,560
Be quick.

105
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,120
(Yunrou should be ready.)

106
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,280
(I need to lure him
to the activation mechanism.)

107
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,400
Go on.

108
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,200
Your Highness,

109
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,960
in my opinion,

110
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,720
this match

111
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,680
does not need to continue.

112
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,360
Blazing oil?

113
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,040
Ling Cang!

114
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,920
I'll save you!

115
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,200
Ling Cang!

116
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,040
Wait for me.

117
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,320
I'll find someone to help!

118
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,400
Your Highness!

119
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,840
The dungeon is on fire!

120
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,240
Quick, save the Prince!

121
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,840
- Yes!
- No, Your Highness!

122
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,240
The fire is too strong. We can't get in!

123
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,280
Your Highness!

124
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,320
Your Highness! Your Highness!

125
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,440
Your Highness!

126
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,680
Your Highness!

127
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,920
Let me go!

128
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,910
Don't hold me back!

129
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,360
I'm going to save him!

130
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,720
Let go of me!

131
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,400
Your Highness!

132
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,920
Your Highness!

133
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,440
The fire is too intense.

134
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,200
If you go in, it'll be suicide!

135
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,720
Let go!

136
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,760
Let go of me!

137
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,160
Let go!

138
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,920
I said let go of me!

139
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,520
Your Highness...

140
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
I beg you...

141
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,440
Let go of me.

142
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,360
Yunrou,

143
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,520
am I vicious?

144
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,920
Your Highness!

145
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,360
- What Your Highness has done
- Your Highness!

146
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,800
must have a reason.

147
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,320
Your Highness!

148
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,640
Your Highness!

149
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,380
I am vicious.

150
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,240
Your Highness!

151
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,040
I am utterly unforgivable.

152
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,120
Your Highness!

153
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
That's not true.

154
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,080
Your Highness is the pride of the Yan people,

155
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,640
the kindest soul of all.

156
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,040
I also want to be a good person.

157
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,120
But I don't want to die.

158
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,840
I have no choice.

159
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,960
Your Highness...

160
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,480
(If I don't do this,)

161
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,280
(Father, Mother, and I)

162
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,800
(will all die horribly.)

163
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,560
Your Highness!

164
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,280
Your Highness!

165
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,800
Your Highness!

166
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,680
Don't kill me.

167
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,640
Don't kill me.

168
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,960
Don't kill me.

169
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,440
Don't kill me!

170
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,360
Don't kill me.

171
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,040
Are you human or ghost?

172
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,520
Are you human or ghost?

173
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,680
Don't come any closer!

174
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,640
With that little courage, you dared to kill?

175
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,240
Are you so afraid of me,

176
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,040
so afraid

177
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,120
you had to kill me?

178
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,960
You're not dead?

179
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,880
I'm not dead.

180
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,200
You're very disappointed?

181
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,840
How could I be?

182
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,560
I really wanted to save you that day.

183
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,520
But the fire was just too intense.

184
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,640
Look,

185
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,720
I got hurt too.

186
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,560
Does it hurt?

187
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,240
It does.

188
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,440
It hurts a lot.

189
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,320
Your Highness was badly injured to save me.

190
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,760
It seems

191
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,920
you are deeply in love with me.

192
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,880
Then when shall we marry?

193
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,160
When shall we be engaged?

194
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,960
Well...

195
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,120
That needs to be discussed
with my father and mother.

196
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,120
I advise you not to play tricks.

197
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,960
That fire in the dungeon wouldn't
stand close scrutiny.

198
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,800
Blazing oil exists only in Yan.

199
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,160
If envoys from my country

200
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,760
find out anything,

201
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,480
the alliance will fail,

202
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,720
and war may break out.

203
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,760
In the end, it's still the people of Yan
who will suffer.

204
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,200
I keep my word.

205
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,520
Tomorrow,

206
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,240
I'll go with you to request marriage.

207
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,480
Good.

208
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,720
Your...

209
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,590
Your...

210
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,040
Your Highness.

211
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,480
Your Highness.

212
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:21,680
Your Highness.

213
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,590
By the way,

214
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,160
how is the Prince of Ling here?

215
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,720
Wasn't he dead?

216
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,680
Right.

217
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,360
Yan's water dungeon is airtight.

218
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,720
How did it fail to burn him alive?

219
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,520
Something's definitely wrong here.

220
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,920
Could it be

221
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,400
he's not human?

222
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,240
That Ling Cang is infamous,

223
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,800
but there's never been any rumor

224
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,440
of him being anything other than human.

225
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,400
If he's not mortal,

226
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,080
could he

227
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,640
be a cultivator?

228
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,800
A cultivator?

229
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,400
The kind who can fly?

230
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,200
If that's true,

231
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,680
I absolutely cannot marry him.

232
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,300
(Ghost Market)

233
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,970
Honored guest of noble birth

234
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,040
should not tread upon lowly soil,

235
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,840
lest you invite trouble.

236
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,400
What trouble?

237
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,600
(Nether Judge, King of the Ghost Market)
You want to defy the heavens.

238
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,560
Is that not trouble enough?

239
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,000
They all say fate is destined by the heavens,

240
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,000
but I don't want to repeat the past.

241
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,320
In this life,

242
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,800
I just want to live well.

243
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,480
Life and death are fated by heaven.

244
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,120
You and I are mere mortals.

245
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,250
Do not force it.

246
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,640
What if I insist?

247
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,880
I only govern ghostly matters,

248
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,280
not the will of the heavens.

249
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,200
If you insist on defying the heavenly way,

250
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,520
that's beyond me.

251
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,560
But my rules,

252
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,600
cannot be broken.

253
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,880
Whose life do you want to take?

254
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,360
The Eldest Prince of Ling,

255
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,120
Ling Cang.

256
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,480
Him?

257
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,600
Disciple of the Veilcloud Sect.

258
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,240
That one's not easy to deal with.

259
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,080
Triple the price.

260
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,520
It's not even about that.

261
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,040
That Veilcloud Sect is full of cowards.

262
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,240
So when it comes to defense,
they have many tricks.

263
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,200
Then

264
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,360
is there a way?

265
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,840
Are you familiar with him?

266
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,440
Fairly.

267
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,120
I have an array from the Heavenly Realm,

268
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,640
called the Bloodrain Slaughter Array.

269
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,840
It can break through all protection spells.

270
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,800
But it can only be set up outside

271
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,080
the Ghost Market, in the Rosy Fate Woods.

272
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,280
Alright.

273
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,560
I'll bring him there.

274
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,400
He's a cultivator.

275
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,720
If we set up the array too early,

276
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,280
he might detect it.

277
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,560
I have a pre-refined array disc.

278
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,160
I'll have some people get ready.

279
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,920
All you have to do is throw it,

280
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,200
and we'll activate the array.

281
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,280
Guard it carefully.

282
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,400
The array disc is extremely hard to make.

283
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,640
If it's lost,

284
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,880
the array must be fueled by human blood.

285
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,080
The blood donor must stay inside the array,

286
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,320
and it's highly likely they will die.

287
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,680
Tomorrow at dusk, Rosy Fate Woods.

288
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,400
I'll have some people waiting.

289
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,760
Let's go.

290
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,960
What you said this morning
about being crown princess,

291
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,080
that was true,

292
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,400
right?

293
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,400
Do you believe me?

294
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,520
I don't know why things are the way they are,

295
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,440
but I believe in Your Highness.

296
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,120
Good girl.

297
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,800
It's alright.

298
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,760
It'll be fine after we take care of Ling Cang.

299
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,360
It's almost dawn.

300
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,600
We have to get back quickly.

301
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,120
By the way,

302
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,400
remember to help me draft a marriage agreement.

303
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,400
I need it to keep that Ling Cang appeased.

304
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,000
Help me.

305
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,960
Go! Quickly!

306
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,760
But he...

307
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,000
he seems to still be alive.

308
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,960
This man is covered in injuries,

309
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,120
lying in a place like this.

310
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,640
He could be serious trouble.

311
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,840
We're supposed to keep a low profile.

312
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,200
We mustn't draw attention.

313
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,200
Go.

314
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,760
Yunrou, I told you,

315
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,880
don't pick wildflowers by the roadside.

316
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,240
Don't pick up strange men either.

317
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,600
Or at best, you'll suffer
physically and emotionally.

318
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,320
At worst, your entire clan will be wiped out.

319
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,040
Yunrou, come here and help me.

320
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,400
Aren't we supposed to go find
the Prince of Ling?
