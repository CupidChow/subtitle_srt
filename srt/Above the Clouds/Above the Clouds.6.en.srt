=Episode 6=

3
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,160
Since you're so eager to die,

4
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,240
then I shall grant your wish.

5
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,560
Drag her up and bring her to the front yard.

6
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,160
Today,

7
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,640
whoever can hit her with an arrow

8
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,000
will be rewarded with 10,000 taels of gold,

9
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,080
a hundred acres of good land, ten mansions,

10
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,320
and a hundred beauties.

11
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,240
I'll go first.

12
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,600
Your Highness,

13
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,040
please allow me a try.

14
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,040
Don't say I never gave you a chance.

15
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,800
If you truly survive these arrows,

16
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,360
I will allow you

17
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,320
to leave the Kingdom of Ling.

18
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,000
Do you mean it?

19
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,960
A promise is a promise.

20
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,120
Go ahead.

21
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,200
Wait.

22
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,160
Your Highness,

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,880
long time no see.

24
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,240
What an unexpected guest.

25
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,080
Since your residence is so lively today,

26
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,520
as your elder brother,

27
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,440
I must come and show my support.

28
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,880
Why did you stop the archery?

29
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,840
It's been a while since I last shot an arrow.

30
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,320
I wonder if my skills have gone rusty.

31
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,160
So,

32
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,640
I wanted to give it a try.

33
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,400
As you wish.

34
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,520
Wait.

35
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,480
Your archery skills are excellent.

36
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,440
If you truly kill Anning

37
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,640
with a single arrow,

38
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,560
then what fun would we have left?

39
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,920
How about this?

40
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,800
You shoot

41
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,640
blindfolded.

42
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,280
Your Highness, please.

43
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,960
Apologies.

44
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,560
My hand slipped.

45
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,400
But I have a small request.

46
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,800
Please speak.

47
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,920
She once humiliated me,

48
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,520
leaving my heart stifled with resentment.

49
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,640
So seeing her again today,

50
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,760
I wish I could crush her bones.

51
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,000
Unfortunately, with so many people around,

52
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,640
it's hard for me to make a move,

53
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,800
for fear that rumors will spread,

54
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,520
saying the royal family is cruel

55
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,720
and treats life as worthless.

56
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,400
She's just a prisoner.

57
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,960
Why care about her life?

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,160
In that case,

59
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,000
please allow me

60
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,480
to flay her alive

61
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,160
to vent my hatred.

62
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,640
This princess is truly unlucky

63
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,520
to have ended up with him.

64
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,640
The eldest prince is extremely cruel.

65
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,040
Those who offend him often die tragic deaths.

66
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,280
No.

67
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,560
I do not allow it.

68
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,120
If she doesn't matter,

69
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,120
then why are you so insistent?

70
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,320
Could it be

71
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,640
that you've truly fallen for her?

72
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,520
What nonsense are you saying?

73
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,720
Back in the Yan court,

74
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,880
you declared in front of everyone

75
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,480
that you'd protect her for life.

76
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,360
The look in your eyes then

77
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,080
is exactly the same as now.

78
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,560
Shut up.

79
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,440
You brought her all the way back from afar,

80
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,920
pitying her, loving her,

81
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,680
afraid that I, the demon,

82
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,360
would come for her soul.

83
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,400
That's perfectly reasonable.

84
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,960
Your Highness,

85
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,120
do you really love that princess?

86
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,560
His Highness seems rattled.

87
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,080
Did the eldest prince strike a nerve?

88
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,320
Impossible.

89
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,200
Why would His Highness care about a prisoner?

90
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,440
Absolutely impossible.

91
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,680
Shut up.

92
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,560
Just a prisoner.

93
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,680
If you want her,

94
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,920
she's yours.

95
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,440

112
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,440
With rest, she'll recover.

113
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,520
Her tendons will take time to heal.

114
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,760
She'll be able to move normally again,

115

00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,600

119
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,360
There's someone else inside her.

120
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,480
He really takes my Yan Kingdom
as if it were in his pocket,

121
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,680
easily grasped?

123
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,560
Stop talking.

124
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,200
There's nothing to explain.

125
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,160
I barely know him.

126
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,920
Dear Yun!

127
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,360
I want to marry Yun.

128
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,560

I want to marry Yun.

130
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,680
I thought she was acting.

131
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,800
No wonder she seemed like a different person.

132
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,040
Who is this girl?

133
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,560
She could be the main character in a storybook.

134
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,880
She's Yan Anning, the Princess of Yan.

135
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,030
She's the very person

136
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,320
your master had to find
using the Flame Technique?

137
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,040

the crown prince's manor.

139
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,160
Is there a solution

This is the first time I've seen such a case.

145
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,040
I'll check the medical scrolls
my master left me.

146
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,520
Maybe there's a way.

Quick, sit her up and hold her tight.

149
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,560
I'll use a spell to reconnect her tendons.

150
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,840
It's going to hurt.

No need.

197

To find someone with the Flame Technique,

198
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,760
you must burn something they once owned.

199
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,560

the way I treated you...

208
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,160
Was it because of the new soul inside you?

give him everything,

217
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,960
and then be tormented to death by him.

218
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,440
What does that mean?

219
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,120
