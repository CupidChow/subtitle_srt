=Above The Clouds=

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,900
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,880
And your fate

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,760
is to give everything to the man you love,

5
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,120
only to be tormented to death.

6
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,400
The only way to change that

7
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,640
is to strike first and kill him.

8
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,570
Your true heart is the most precious thing
in the world.

9
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,160
Have you ever done anything to betray me?

10
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,760
You are my wife.

11
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,600
How could I ever betray you?

12
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,880
You shouldn't have betrayed me.

13
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,760
Those who dare defy fate

14
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,600
shall die.

15
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,480
So this is why you feared me,

16
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,880
tried to kill me,

17
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,680
made that agreement never to see me again?

18
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,240
It's not your fault.

20
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,600
I thought if you left, nothing would happen.

21
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,680
But I never imagined

22
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,920
the one destined to kill me in this life

23
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,160
would be Ling Yun.

24
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,000
Everything Ling Yun has today

25
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,560
is entirely because

26
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,680
he can seduce one woman after another,

27
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,880
making them throw themselves at him
like moths to a flame.

28
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,440
A man like Ling Yun, in storybooks,

29
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,480
is said to have "main character aura."

30
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,780
She's the one who saved you earlier,

31
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,180
Divine Physicker Yao Sheng.

32
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,380
Thank you for saving me.

33
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,020
No need to thank me.

34
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,540
You should thank him.

35
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,460
He got his hand bitten by you.

36
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,940
It's nothing.

37
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,060
Just now, you mentioned

38
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,340
"main character aura."

39
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,100
What does that mean?

40
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,290
That means no matter what the protagonist does,

41
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,660
it's as if the heavens are helping them.

42
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,780
Even if they're shot or fall off a cliff,
they won't die.

43
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,540
No wonder

44
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,580
I couldn't kill Ye Sha in my past life,

45
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,900
and I can't kill Ling Yun in this one.

46
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,020
If she's the female lead,

47
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,340
then what am I in the storybook?

48
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,220
The villain.

49
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,500
What's a villain?

50
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,580
The villain is someone who goes against
the protagonist.

51
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,140
Anyone who defies the protagonist's will
is a villain.

52
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,380
And villains always die for one reason
or another.

53
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,260
According to what you said,

54
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,500
as long as you follow the protagonist's wishes,

55
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,860
you'll survive?

56
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,620
It's not quite that simple.

57
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,260
The protagonist isn't all-powerful either.

58
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,860
There are things even they can't do.

59
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,100
Like what?

60
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,870
Like if the female lead doesn't love
the male lead,

61
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,770
then he can't even enter the storyline.

62
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,850
And then all problems are solved.

63
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,590
If we can't kill Ling Yun directly,

64
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,700
then we'll just

65
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,600
have to try a different method.

66
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,030
Are you trying to

67
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,340
check Xiangyun Pavilion's account book?

68
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,260
How did you know?

69
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,180
Your Highness,

70
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,660
a trace of a cultivator was found upstairs.

71
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,100
Is it Ling Cang?

72
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,180
Judging by the lingering energy,

73
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,700
it doesn't seem like the eldest prince.

74
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,140
I've placed a Golden Seal Array

75
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,460
on the account book.

76
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,940
No one can open it.

77
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,460
Make sure no one discovers it.

78
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,340
Golden Seal Array

79
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,060
was created by my Lu family.

80
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,340
Even though I don't cultivate in this life,

81
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,540
I still know

82
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,580
where the formation core is.

83
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,980
I can help you break the array

84
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,820
and get the account book.

85
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,940
His Highness and I were going to

86
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,780
look for the account book

87
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,940
to expose how the crown prince
harm innocent women

88
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,740
and bribe court officials.

89
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,060
Now it comes effortlessly.

90
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,500
Then I must thank you, Your Highness.

91
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,420
I told you I was useful.

92
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,620
I wasn't lying.

93
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,460
At that time,

94
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,140
the circumstances forced me.

95
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,500
It's getting late.

96
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,730
You, hurry and explain
how to break the formation.

97
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,740
The other, go get the account book.

98
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,900
The sooner we move the plot forward,

99
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,460
the sooner we can all go home and sleep.

100
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,010
I only have one bed.

101
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,690
I can't keep this many people.

102
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,460
Besides, I haven't finished reading
my storybook yet.

103
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,900
(Prince Cang's Manor, Ling Kingdom)

104
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:55,780
I'll go get the account book.

105
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,140
You rest for now.

106
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,780
Breaking the Array will consume
a lot of spiritual energy.

107
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,580
It's best not to use any spells afterward.

108
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,060
Alright.

109
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,140
From now on, this is your room.

110
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,420
Tell me

111
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,340
if you need anything.

112
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,260
(I've arrived safely at Prince Cang's manor.)

113
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,580
(That means)

114
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,140
(the visions I saw can be changed.)

115
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,300
(If I can master this ability)

116
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,740
(to foresee and change the future...)

117
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,580
Are you even listening to me?

118
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,100
Chi Xiao,

119
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,080
can you swim?

120
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,420
Yes.

121
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,860
I'm really fast at it.

122
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,260
I catch the fish in the backyard pond
every year.

123
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,420
Then take me to the backyard.

124
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,140
We're here.

125
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,380
But we already fished this year.

126
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,660
What's left are just the small ones.

127
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:48,980
What are you trying to do?

128
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,780
Listen,

129
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,300
if I haven't come up

130
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,260
after half a stick of incense,

131
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,800
pull me out.

132
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,420
But if the time hasn't passed,

133
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,820
no matter how I struggle,

134
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,100
don't interfere.

135
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,860
(Xiangyun Pavilion)

136
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,750
(Oh no.)

137
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,720
(I have a cramp in my leg.)

138
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,620
Four Symbols encircle the realms,

139
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,260
Yin-Yang shift reveals the core.

She's

If you truly want to die,

170
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,620
why did you let me save you in the first place?

171
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,980
Throwing your life away like that,

172
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,220
is that how you honor your pain and suffering?

173
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:14,870
I...

174
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,060
The Yan princess I know

175
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,220
is resolute and tenacious,

176
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,140
a true hero.

177
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,180
Not a coward who wallows

178
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,740
in self-pity and seeks death.

179
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,980
Does it still hurt?

180
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,420
So what if Ling Yun is powerful,

181
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,860
so what if he has main character aura?

182
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,620
I've recovered the account book.

183
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,860
There will always be a way.

184
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,660
I...

185
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,900
I didn't really want to die.

186
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,500
Really?

187
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,940
Of course.

188
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,700
I just wanted to see

189
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,860
if I'd get a new vision.

190
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,180
What vision?

191
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,580
I...

192
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,860
I didn't see anything.

193
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,180
It's fine.

194
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,700
But from now on,

195
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
don't risk your life to test it.

196
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,500
I can't always arrive in time.

197
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,180
Right.

198
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,260
How did you get back so fast?

199
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,620
I...

200
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,500
I heard you call my name.

201
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,340
I...

202
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,580
I...

203
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,220
I called you?

204
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,660
I don't remember.

205
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,060
Maybe because

206
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,860
our seas of consciousness connected last night,

207
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,540
that's why I could sense you.

208
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,500
But it reminded me.

209
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,300
This is the Voice Incantation.

210
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,060
If you're in danger again,

211
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,380
call my name.

212
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,260
I'll come.

213
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,590
Okay.

214
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:48,180
(Qin Se Sheng Qing)

215
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,050
- She wasn't trying to die?
- Your Highness, since when

216
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,180
did you care so much about her?

217
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,100
Where are you going this late?

218
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,420
I'm going to kill you.

219
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,460
(She actually managed to hurt me.)

220
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,940
(Xiangyun Pavilion Dungeon)
If you admit fault now,

221
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,500
I'll let you go.

222
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,980
You can return to a life of luxury.

223
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,220
Strange, isn't it?

224
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,380
All the others were obedient and docile.

225
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,900
But I

226
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:52,460
just happen to like your unyielding nature.

227
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,500
Your Highness.

228
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,100
