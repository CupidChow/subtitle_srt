00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,740
=Episode 14=

3
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,640
Anning,

4
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,320
you'll be alright.

5
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,080
It's meaningless.

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,720
I am just a remnant soul.

7
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,600
Once she agrees,

8
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,040
place the array disc in your hands.

9
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,160
I won't let you die.

10
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,000
Anning,

11
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,520
thank you.

12
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,280
Thank you

13
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,760
for always tolerating me,

14
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,960
for forgiving me,

15
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,360
for loving me.

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,680
Ning.

17
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,920
The pain will ease soon.

18
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,240
Ning.

19
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,520
I know.

20
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,800
I'm just a soul residing in your body.

21
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,600
It's me who occupied your body,

22
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,720
acting stubbornly,

23
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,320
causing you to lose your country

24
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,280
and your family.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,760
It's you who let go of grudges,

26
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,280
taught me to cherish myself,

27
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,120
and to love.

28
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,160
Thank you

29
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,160
for letting me truly live.

30
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,120
I am already very satisfied.

31
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,520
I should have

32
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,000
returned your body

33
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,920
and your face to you long ago.

34
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,360
No,

35
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,960
no.

36
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,520
Ning,

37
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,960
Ning.

38
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,600
Yan Anning married Ling Yun,

39
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,640
but was abused and killed by him.

40
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,960
Finally, the day has come.

41
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,300
(Prince Cang's Mansion)

42
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,120
Chi Xiao, go find some Starfall Grass.

43
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,040
Alright.

44
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,920
You are awake.

45
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,880
Then come and help me.

46
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,760
His Golden Core is damaged.

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,400
He'll consume me too much spirit power.

48
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,050
How is it?

49
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,440
I've checked her sea of consciousness,

50
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,460
what's inside her body is the original soul.

51
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,360
Original soul?

52
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,890
Then she is

53
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,280
the original Yan Anning?

54
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,800
But why doesn't she remember me,

55
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,400
yet returns to the mansion?

56
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,800
I can't probe deeply into the reason.

57
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,920
Should we summon Nether Judge?

58
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,180
No need.

59
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,920
It's better if she doesn't remember.

60
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,320
Go prepare our wedding quickly.

61
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,760
She's finally back,

62
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,800
and has forgotten the past.

63
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,680
Of course,

64
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,000
I must hold tightly to her.

65
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,440
Yes.

66
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,200
What have you been talking about?
I'm so sleepy.

67
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,800
Anning,

68
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,880
you may never recover your memory.

69
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,480
But don't worry,

70
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,440
you are the one I love most.

71
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,960
As long as you stay by my side,

72
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,440
I will protect you fully.

73
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,640
OK.

74
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,000
This place,

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,240
I always feel it's familiar.

76
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,360
Is this...

77
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,480
Is this mine?

78
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,040
Everything here

79
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,520
belongs to you.

80
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,160
Anning.

81
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,120
You will be the most beautiful
Crown Princess Consort.

82
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,360
Your Highness,

83
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,960
I personally cooked your favorite porridge.

84
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,680
Why is this prisoner here?

85
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,960
Rude! What prisoner?

86
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,040
This is my Crown Princess Consort.

87
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,320
Didn't you say you loved me the most?

88
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,000
Who is she?

89
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,560
If you don't like her,

90
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,480
I'll make her leave now.

91
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,720
You!

92
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,800
How dare you corrupt His Highness?

93
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,640
I...

94
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,360
You!

95
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,010
How dare you hit the Crown Prince?

96
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,680
I will teach you a lesson.

97
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,640
I didn't mean it.

98
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,480
You...

99
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,680
You won't be angry, right?

100
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,120
It's okay.

101
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
Get some rest.

102
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,040
Your Highness.

103
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,960
Get lost!

104
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,200
Don't follow me.

105
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,560
Who are you?

106
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,640
You...

107
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,020
You...

108
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,720
why are you marrying Ling Yun?

109
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,120
How did you break in?

110
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
I don't know you.

111
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Anning,

112
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,880
it's me,

113
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,320
Ling Cang.

114
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,920
I don't know you.

115
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,440
Let go of me.

116
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:23,850
- I don't know you.
- You don't know me?

117
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,000
What did Ling Yun do to you?

118
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,400
Ling Yun?

119
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,200
Dear Yun, Dear Yun.

120
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,400
Do you recognize me now?

121
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,560
How could you...

122
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,520
Anning,

123
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,200
what's going on inside?

124
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,320
Can I come in?

125
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,400
Dear Yun,

126
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,500
Dear Yun, save me!

127
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,860
Anning.

128
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,780
Ling Cang?

129
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,780
How dare you be so reckless,

130
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,180
breaking into my bridal chamber,

131
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,260
kidnapping the Crown Princess Consort?

132
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,580
This is treason,

133
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,780
breaking the law.

134
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,020
Let her go at once,

135
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,420
or I will punish you immediately.

136
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,300
What if I don't?

137
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,900
Then tonight,

138
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,620
you can't leave my mansion.

139
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,180
You think you can stop me?

140
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,740
Let me go!

141
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,940
Dear Yun.

142
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,940
Lu Anning!

143
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,020
My dear brother,

144
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,660
you've seen it yourself,

145
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,140
she refuses to go with you.

146
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,160
Regarding tonight,

147
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,100
I'll let it slide

148
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,180
for the sake of family.

149
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,060
If you continue to be obstinate

150
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,340
and refuse to leave,

151
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,780
I will punish you.

152
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:01,900
Don't forget,

153
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,580
your magic has no effect on me.

154
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,780
Did you hear that?

155
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,900
Now hurry and leave.

156
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,380
Goodbye.

157
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,860
(Joyful)

158
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,700
Where's the hairpin?

159
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,180
Where is it?

160
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,900
Where did it go?

161
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,790
My hairpin!

162
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,790
Your Highness, please stop looking.

163
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,490
If you keep searching, you'll be late.

164
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,030
No, I have to find that hairpin.

165
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,780
Anning,

166
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,500
what are you looking for?

167
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,530
The hairpin.

168
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,220
Dear Yun, my hairpin is missing.

169
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,260
Hairpin?

170
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,620
It's just a hairpin.

171
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,060
I can buy you as many as you want later.

172
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,180
Such an important day,

173
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,620
how can I not have that hairpin?

174
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,820
That hairpin is our token of love.

175
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,620
Without it,

176
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,860
I won't get married.

177
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,980
But

178
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,420
that kind of hairpin only exists in Yan.

179
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,460
Today is our wedding day.

180
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,500
Yan is too far from Ling Kingdom,

181
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,780
there won't be enough time.

182
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,140
I don't care.

183
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,420
I want that hairpin.

184
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,020
Nan Zhu.

185
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,260
Here.

186
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,380
Set off immediately for Yan Kingdom

187
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,940
using the teleportation array.

188
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,300
Bring back the hairpin as fast as possible.

189
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,340
Yes.

190
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,820
Anning,

191
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,590
I've ordered Nan Zhu to go quickly buy it.

192
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,740
Let's get married first, okay?

193
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,100
If we miss the auspicious time,

194
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,860
it won't be good.
