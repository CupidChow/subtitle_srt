3
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,080
Xi Yue.

4
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,120
Xi Yue, I found the Celestial Bone Flute.

5
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:29,920
Xi Yue.

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,120
Xi Yue.

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,280
Her spiritual energy is draining.

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,680
Could it be...

9
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,960
In Lu Anning's 1,002nd lifetime,

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,520
Princess Yan Anning,

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,520
First Empress in Yan's history,

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,960
led the nation into a golden age.

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,960
That's impossible.

14
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,120
I ripped her heart out with my own hands.

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,720
No one could survive

16
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,880
such wounds.

17
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,440
You've finally come.

18
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,560
(The Luminous Heart has fully fused with her.)

19
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,560
(I can't take it by force.)

20
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,800
Don't be so tense.

21
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,800
I didn't come here today

22
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,040
to take your lives.

23
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,960
Surely,

24
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,440
you have other plans.

25
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,640
You want to change your fate, right?

26
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,400
I came to help.

27
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,000
Help me?

28
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,920
I have control of the Providence Vault.

29
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,680
Every destiny under heaven

30
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,280
is within my grasp.

31
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,440
Give me the Luminous Heart,

32
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,920
and I will help you rewrite your destiny.

33
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,360
You've possessed my beloved twice,

34
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,640
and killed me with their hands.

35
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,360
You think I'd believe you now?

36
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,600
Whatever.

37
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,800
But I'll warn you,

38
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,360
you alone cannot

39
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,360
defy the will of Heaven.

40
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,360
If you want the Luminous Heart that badly,

41
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,120
it must mean you need it

42
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,160
to fulfill something important.

43
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,000
In that case,

44
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,800
instead of mutual destruction,

45
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,960
why don't we

46
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,440
work together?

47
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,960
Anning.

48
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,560
Don't agree to this.

49
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,840
Fine. I'll

50
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,040
cooperate with you.

51
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,080
But the Luminous Heart

52
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,920
is too tightly bound to me now.

53
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,640
I need time to separate from it.

54
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,200
Come back

55
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,760
in three days.

56
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,480
Very well.

57
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,560
Then we have a deal.

58
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,640
By agreeing to cooperate with him,

59
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,360
you're walking into a trap.

60
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,920
I know.

61
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,880
But this is the only way

62
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,200
I can get into the Providence Vault

63
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,960
and uncover how Yu Han rewrote my fate.

64
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,620
But I don't want you to take this risk.

65
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,760
He's gathering all the divine artifacts.

66
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,160
His intentions can't be good.

67
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,360
Do you know what happens
when all four artifacts are united?

68
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,760
Legend says

69
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,560
they grant the wielder power

70
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,960
equal to the heavens.

71
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,240
Yu Han is a Star Lord.

72
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,720
Only Fate is above him.

73
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,720
If he's collecting the artifacts,

74
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,480
he intends

75
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,560
to overthrow Fate.

76
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,760
And that suits me perfectly.

77
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,670
If I can take this chance

78
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,200
to collect the other three artifacts,

79
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,560
I can destroy him,

80
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,690
Fate,

81
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,920
and the Providence Vault

82
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,200
all at once.

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,520
But what if you fail?

84
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,840
I've already failed a thousand lifetimes.

85
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,160
What's one more?

86
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,520
Besides,

87
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,760
this time, I have the Luminous Heart.

88
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,760
OK.

89
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
I'll go with you.

90
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,040
Good.

91
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,080
What are you doing?

92
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,560
Ling Cang,

93
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,640
let me see.

94
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,240
Why would you do this to your face?

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,840
Not only you

96
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,320
dislike this face.

97
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,160
Even I find it repulsive.

98
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,120
If I weren't so powerless,

99
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,200
I wouldn't have been manipulated
for two lifetimes,

100
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,160
or let you suffer so much.

101
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,600
I would have rewritten our fate.

102
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,920
It's not your fault.

103
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,000
You mustn't blame yourself.

104
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,760
But weakness is a fault.

105
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,600
No, it's not.

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,200
If not for you,

107
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,000
I would've died long ago in my destined end.

108
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,360
It was you

109
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,160
who pulled me back time and again,

110
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,240
who saved me,

111
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,960
protected me,

112
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,320
loved me.

113

00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,320

fused with Lu Anning.

Rather than endless conflict,

Cooperate?

163
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,240
I told her

164
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,640
we'd help her change fate,

165
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
and she agreed.

166
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,120
Once we bring her

167
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,640
into the Providence Vault,

168
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,720
we'll activate the divine artifacts,

169
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,520
open the array,

170
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,530
and forcefully extract her power.

00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,840
She won't survive.

00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,120
You're not afraid she'll trick you?

173
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,640
Once the artifacts merge,

174
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,800
they'll create a destructive force.

176

what she tries,
