(Divine Retribution Altar, Divine Realm)

4
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,360
See?

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,200
No matter where you flee,

6
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,520
you'll end up being dragged back by Jing Yun.

7
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,120
All I did was cultivate demonic arts.

8
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,440
Must I really die for that?

9
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,920
What kind of logic is this?

10
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,600
Fate is predetermined.

11
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,520
It cannot be changed.

12
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,280
If you try, the Star Lord

13
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,040
will possess the one closest to you

14
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,120
and silently kill you, casting you

15
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,240
into the cycle of reincarnation,

16
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,400
forcing you to repeat the same fate
again and again.

17
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,040
Stop struggling.

18
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,640
No. No.

19
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,080
Your Majesty.

20
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,160
I'm already gravely injured.

21
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,360
I only beg you to spare my life.

22
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,200
Once I've recovered,

23
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,320
I'll leave on my own.

24
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,990
I won't trouble you.

25
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,800
Fine.

26
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,480
You...

27
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,120
Aren't you afraid that Star Lord
will come kill you?

28
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,200
They say he is without emotion.

29
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,960
But if I inject half my soul into you,

30
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,440
I can make you my own.

31
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,200
Into me?

32
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,960
That's right.

33
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,520
Didn't you say

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,160
he possesses the one

35
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,960
dearest to the defier of fate?

36
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,360
Too bad,

37
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,000
I have no parents,

38
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,200
no friends,

39
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,360
no lover.

40
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,520
Even my master

41
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,240
was killed by me long ago.

42
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,600
So now,

43
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,360
I have no choice

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,960
but to make you my most precious person.

45
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,440
That's right, Xi Yue.

46
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,760
Now kill him.

47
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,480
Once you kill him,

48
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,360
I'll be yours to command.

49
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,800
I'll possess him.

50
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,440
Strange.

51
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,640
Why am I feeling dizzy?

52
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,040
I...

53
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,760
We're still too late.

54
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,920
Why are you here?

55
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,200
Xi Yue,

56
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,520
I know you want to change your fate,

57
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,040
but you've chosen the wrong way.

58
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,640
None of us have control over our own destinies.

59
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,040
If we truly want to defy fate,

60
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,040
we must destroy the rules set by Fate entirely.

61
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,840
And how do I know you're not here
just to drag me back?

62
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,320
If that were my goal,

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,600
why would I have defended you that day?

64
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,280
(The Demon Sovereign's power is vast.)

65
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,280
(My own power hasn't fully returned.)

66
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,760
(I can't face him head-on.)

67
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,240
(I'll observe first.)

68
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,800
Fine.

69
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,440
If you say you want to help me,

70
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,720
how?

71
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,640
I know where the Providence Vault is.

72
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,240
If we destroy it,

73
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,160
only then can we control our own fate.

74
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,200
Come with me.

75
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,880
What are you doing here?

76
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,240
Kill her

77
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,440
and everything in the future
will cease to happen.

78
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,200
No.

79
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,800
You're all in this together to kill me!

80
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,440
That's not it, Xi Yue.

81
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,360
I...

82
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,760
Xi Yue!

83
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,680
Help me!

84
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,720
Xi Yue!

85
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,080
Those who dare defy fate

86
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,000
shall die.

87
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,590
Xi Yue,

88
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,160
trained in demonic ways

89
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,000
and sought to rewrite fate,

90
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,920
was slain by Emperor Jing Yun.

91
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,440
Yu Han,

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,160
having gained emotions and desires,

93
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,560
died to protect Xi Yue.

94
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,880
It was him.

95
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,640
Xi Yue is no different from us.

96
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,280
None of this was her fault.

97
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,040
It was all predetermined by Fate.

98
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,040
She was forced to become a villain,

99
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,480
forced to die.

100
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,680
It was all him!

101
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,800
Anning.

102
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,160
Yao Sheng?

103
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,360
She's not Yao Sheng.

104
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,400
Lu Anning,

105
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,400
Ye Sha,

106
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,360
you have destroyed Xi Yue and Yu Han,

107
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,200
thus restoring order.

108
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,760
You will be

109
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,400
greatly rewarded.

110
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,440
You're Fate.

111
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,880
I knew I have chosen the right person.

112
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,960
You figured it out right away.

113
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,680
No wonder Yao Sheng liked to read storybooks

114
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,920
and knew everything.

115
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,720
So she was you all along.

116
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,240
I had no choice.

117
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,270
I couldn't let Xi Yue and Yu Han
discover I existed.

118
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,760
So you used us.

119
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,120
You're the most defiant person I've ever seen.

120
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,720
That's why you were perfect
for dealing with them.

121
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,960
The fact that I wielded the divine artifacts,

122
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,560
that was your doing too?

123
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,680
Otherwise,

124
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,440
how could you possibly defeat Yu Han,

125
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,880
or gather all four artifacts

126
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,360
to go back ten thousand years
and rewrite history?

127
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,880
So your so-called "rewriting history"

128
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,880
meant killing Xi Yue and Yu Han?

129
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,440
They disrupted the fate of the world

130
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,360
for selfish desires.

131
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,760
Their crimes are unforgivable.

132
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,880
No.

133
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
They did nothing wrong.

134
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,880
You are the one at fault.

135
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,080
If you hadn't set rules forbidding
the change of fate,

136
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,480
if everyone had the right to control
their own destiny,

137
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,880
none of this would have happened.

138
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,560
You've simply reaped what you sowed.

139
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,080
Without rules, there is no order.

140
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,040
Rules are meant to be followed.

141
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,240
Rules that are unjust

142
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,880
do not deserve to be followed.

143
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,200
If you had benefited from the rules,

144
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,960
you'd never say such a thing,

145
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,360
let alone question their fairness.

146
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,080
