00:00:05,056 --> 00:00:07,296
(Lost You Forever S1 Special Edition 4)

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,359
The nine-headed serpent demon
is Xiang Liu with Nine Lives.

4
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:12,520
Rumor has it

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,640
that he is crafty,

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,279
with nine heads and nine lives.

7
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:16,040
He is one

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,559
of the most formidable figures
in Dahuang.

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,520
Not only is
Xiang Liu's spirit power strong,

10
00:00:19,639 --> 00:00:20,840
but he is also brave and tactful,

11
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,040
and knows military law

12
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,159
and manages soldiers well.

13
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,120
We can see how talented he is.

14
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,639
Chubby,

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,639
I told you several times.

16
00:00:28,799 --> 00:00:30,159
Humans are cunning.

17
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,559
Have you learned a lesson this time?

18
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,080
Please spare my life.

19
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,119
Your Lordship.

20
00:00:37,279 --> 00:00:38,000
Antidote.

21
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:39,159
I'll give you.

22
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:41,040
I was just lucky.

23
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:41,680
Your Lordship,

24
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,639
I'm really a physician.

25
00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:47,000
Guards.

26
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,959
Take him to the camp.

27
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:58,319
(Xiang Liu with Nine Lives.)

28
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:00,119
Who

29
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,159
are you exactly?

30
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:02,439
I am Wen Xiaoliu.

31
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:03,919
But I don't believe it.

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,319
I really am Wen Xiaoliu.

33
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
If you want to live,

34
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:08,360
then work for me.

35
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,319
Be my man

36
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:10,480
and obey me.

37
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,239
I'll give you one night to consider.

38
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,720
I want the answer tomorrow.

39
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,040
I'm a bit thirsty.

40
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:17,239
May I have some water first?

41
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,080
Guards.

42
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,919
Whip him.

43
00:01:22,144 --> 00:01:22,720
Your Lordship,

44
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,760
20 lashes have been done.

45
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:25,040
I still have one condition.

46
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,639
Tell me.

47
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:27,000
I will never leave Qingshui Town.

48
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:27,744
Okay.

49
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,239
Help me make the medicines I want.

50
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,319
If you can't make it,

51
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,680
then use your body in exchange.

52
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,400
For the first time,

53
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:35,160
let's start with your useless ears.

54
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,279
After two times,

55
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:37,480
let's go with the nose.

56
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,080
I won't chop off your hands,

57
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,440
because they are used to make medicine.

58
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:41,639
I understand.

59
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,519
You should know

60
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:45,639
what kind of person I am.

61
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,639
Your Lordship.

62
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,040
Someone broke in.

63
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,239
Your Lordship,

64
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,839
I am already yours.

65
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,120
Don't set your sights on him.

66
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,400
He is mine now.

67
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,559
Upon investigation,

68
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:04,199
you're a civilian from Qingshui Town.

69
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:05,480
You are free to go.

70
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,919
(A woman)

71
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,479
(is hiding her identity.)

72
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,759
(Interesting.)

73
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,960
Here comes an honored guest.

74
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:16,800
This is a gift.

75
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
You are a deity.

76
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:19,520
When they all die,

77
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:21,199
you might still be as you are now.

78
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,000
Is it interesting?

79
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,800
If I can't find enduring companionship,

80
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,240
brief one is also good.

81
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:26,960
Since you're here,

82
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,360
have a drink before you leave.

83
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:29,720
I brewed it.

84
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,600
Have a try.

85
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,080
Apart from the poison in the wine,

86
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,000
there's nothing of value.

87
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:39,240
So, have you been poisoned?

88
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,199
Do you really want to poison me?

89
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,440
For now, we're not enemies.

90
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:45,160
I just want to beat you
with hundreds of whips.

91
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,360
You wish.

92
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,520
Can you swim?

93
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,679
Want to have a competition?

94
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:56,639
With you?

95
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,720
You dare not?

96
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,800
Since you're begging me,

97
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,160
I agree.

98
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:02,360
Let's start.

99
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:08,399
You won.

100
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:09,639
I'll grill a fish for you

101
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,800
as a reward.

102
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,160
I've always been curious.

103
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,360
How did your nine heads

104
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,119
grow?

105
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:16,039
In a horizontal row?

106
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,679
Or did they grow in a vertical row?

107
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,080
Or from left to right?

108
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,399
Don't your heads fight over food?

109
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:21,880
Which one eats first?

110
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,479
And the last...

111
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,199
Actually, I prefer to eat mortals.

112
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,720
Someone like you is just enough

113
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,399
for each of my heads to take a bite.

114
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,440
You have little spirit power,

115
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,240
but your body is a treasure.

116
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,119
You really

117
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,440
eat people?

118
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,160
Dare to talk nonsense now?

119
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,712
No,

120
00:03:44,064 --> 00:03:44,608
no.

121
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,839
Who sent you?

122
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,320
This is far from the camp.

123
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,720
You shouldn't be here.

124
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,479
I'm here

125
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,240
on the orders of General Hong Jiang

126
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,639
to inspect this area.

127
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:02,080
You may leave.

128
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,000
I shall take my leave.

129
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,039
The secret report said
you wanted to see me.

130
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,679
What exactly is so urgent?

131
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:12,160
Xiang Liu.

132
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:14,960
Are you looking for him?

133
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,720
Who sent you?

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,799
Catch him alive.

135
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:02,359
Don't hit my face.

136
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,239
You're sleeping on my bed.

137
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,279
Where should I sleep?

138
00:06:18,528 --> 00:06:19,079
Nine-headed demon.

139
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:20,920
Nine-headed demon.

140
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:23,559
When healing your wounds,

141
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:25,160
you can't lose focus.

142
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,119
How the tables

143
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,559
have turned on you!

144
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,480
Focus on healing.

145
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,200
Don't be disturbed by me.

146
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,000
These two strands of hair.

147
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:37,079
Let me show you.

148
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,839
I will eat you.

149
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,279
Come on. There you go.

150
00:06:44,359 --> 00:06:45,640
Looks like you're almost done.

151
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,600
Then I'll leave now.

152
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,959
I will disappear for a few days.

153
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,399
When you start
to appreciate my goodness,

154
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,239
I'll come back.

155
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,839
Want to eat me?

156
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,119
Come on. There you go.

157
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,160
Wen Xiaoliu,

158
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:02,160
we'll settle this account slowly.

159
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,119
We have all the time in the world.

160
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,399
He actually dares to come to me.

161
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,880
Is he planning to repay me?

162
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:16,920
I'll give you three choices.

163
00:07:16,992 --> 00:07:17,559
First,

164
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,679
whip me 40 times.

165
00:07:18,944 --> 00:07:19,480
Second,

166
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,799
kick me out of here.

167
00:07:20,992 --> 00:07:21,559
Third,

168
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,559
listen to my serious matter.

169
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:23,440
A serious matter.

170
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,880
Why are you taking so much?

171
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,640
I only know you have nine heads,

172
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,399
but I don't know you have nine stomachs.

173
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,519
Tell me

174
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,959
when I should

175
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,679
bite this off?

176
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,200
Such a beautiful night.

177
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,399
How elegant it is

178
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,359
to talk under the moon.

179
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,679
Don't you hate me?

180
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,200
I don't hate you.

181
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,320
I really don't.

182
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,160
Because...

183
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,200
I'm lonely.

184
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,920
I had a strange disease before,

185
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,399
so I hid in the deep mountain.

186
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,279
Then I met a snake demon.

187
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,880
But even knowing the danger,

188
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:57,440
I still provoked it all the time.

189
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:58,440
Because only it could

190
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,799
understand what I was saying.

191
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,839
That snake later...

192
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,600
Died.

193
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:05,480
You killed it?

194
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:06,200
A nine-tailed fox.

195
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,399
What about the fox?

196
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,160
He locked me in a cage

197
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,079
and forced me to eat disgusting things

198
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:12,320
because he wanted to fatten me

199
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,040
before eating me.

200
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,239
You mean

201
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:15,679
I'm just like that snake.

202
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,559
We're both things for you
to alleviate loneliness.

203
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,920
Perhaps, to you,

204
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,640
I am the snake that amuses you.

205
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,640
Didn't you come to me for business?

206
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,720
I don't need your help.

207
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:25,799
I'll ask someone else.

208
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,056
You,

209
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,719
at most,

210
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,200
are that snake egg eaten by others.

211
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,640
Patrolling around

212
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,880
in the middle of the night.

213
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,719
I think the most likely to betray us

214
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,679
is that nine-headed demon.

215
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,000
General trusts

216
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,200
that lowly creature so much.

217
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,080
It really is unsettling.

218
00:08:57,952 --> 00:08:58,520
Come here.

219
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,679
He's not going anywhere.

220
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:00,599
Say what you want

221
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:01,359
right here.

222
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,239
Are you coming over by yourself,

223
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:05,679
or you want me to come to you?

224
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,039
Get on.

225
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:07,936
I'm coming.

226
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:13,880
Chubby!

227
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:16,320
Chubby, you crazy bird,

228
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,520
stop it.

229
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,479
Chubby!

230
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,400
Are you in a bad mood today?

231
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,840
Whenever you're upset,

232
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,239
you would torment me for fun.

233
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:32,200
Why is your spirit power so low?

234
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,760
It's all because of that stupid fox.

235
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,760
In case my spirit power

236
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:36,400
didn't go in vain,

237
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,679
he used medicine to disable me.

238
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,200
I heard the pain

239
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,880
is like bones being drilled.

240
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,119
It seems that my 40 lashes

241
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:42,919
were too light for you.

242
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,520
It's precisely because I suffered

243
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:45,679
so much back then

244
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,440
that I'm really afraid of pain now.

245
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:48,359
In the end,

246
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:49,799
I stayed silent and uncooperative,

247
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,599
even trying to die.

248
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,840
Even someone like you would seek death?

249
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,479
But I never managed to die.

The trend of the world is irreversible.

279
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,320
It's not something
an individual can stop.

280
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:38,359
In your view,

281
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,520
what should I do?

282
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,440
If you like power,

283
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:43,640
you can defect from Hong Jiang

284
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,880
to the King of Xiyan.

285
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:51,280
I was wrong.

286
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,119
I was wrong.

287
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,039
Mr. Xiang,

288
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:03,000
recently in the camp,

289
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,280
many people got sick

290
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:05,239
from malaria.

291
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:07,559
We need lots of medicinal materials.

292
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,559
I will

293
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:09,799
figure it out.

294
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,599
List out the needed medicinal materials.

295
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,840
Yes.

296
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,559
Stop pretending.

297
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:25,200
Is the man by your side

298
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,359
from the Tushan family?

299
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,159
Which one are you talking about?

300
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:32,559
Is that man

301
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,440
Tushan Jing or not?

302
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,799
If I say he's not,

303
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,479
you won't believe it.

304
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,280
Very good.

305
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,840
Many soldiers
have been infected with miasma,

306
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,919
in urgent need of herbs.

307
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:46,039
Ask Tushan Jing

308
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:46,760
to get herbs for us.

309
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,000
I'd rather you eat me

310
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:49,400
than go find him.

311
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:50,400
If I ask

312
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,880
the senior master

313
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,400
to get herbs for me

314
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:54,719
and I kill for him,

315
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,320
what are the chances

316
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,000
of Master Qingqiu's survival?

317
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,640
What

318
00:12:59,039 --> 00:12:59,799
can he get

319
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,080
for helping you?

320
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:03,479
If the senior master
of Tushan asks me to kill him,

321
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,679
I will refuse.

322
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,200
But if he considers killing
the senior master of Tushan,

323
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,239
I will accept it.

324
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:12,919
He's just returned home.

325
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,000
He may not be able to freely mobilize

326
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,919
people

327
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,119
and money in the family.

328
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:18,320
You underestimate him.

329
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
Just some herbs.

330
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,880
It's nothing to him.

331
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,960
Then why don't you just

332
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,599
buy it from the Tushan family?

333
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,760
I have no money.

334
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:28,479
He's by the river.

335
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,119
I need a batch of herbs.

336
00:13:36,239 --> 00:13:37,200
It's all written here.

337
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:37,840
Okay.

338
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,799
Once the herbs are delivered
to Qingshui Town,

339
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,520
notify me.

340
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:41,719
Xiang Liu will go get them.

341
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:42,880
I'm going back to sleep then.

342
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,799
Bye.

343
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,719
Before I get the herbs,

344
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:48,719
you stick with me.

345
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:50,679
Fine.

346
00:13:59,280 --> 00:13:59,840
Defend!

347
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,640
Attack!

348
00:14:04,736 --> 00:14:05,280
Mr. Xiang,

349
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,200
two more soldiers have died.

350
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:18,280
If we can get those herbs soon,

351
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,799
at least they can

352
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,080
live a little longer.

353
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:23,640
They are soldiers.

354
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:26,119
Even if they have to die,

355
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,119
they should die in battle.

356
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:38,320
Someone from the Tushan family
leaked the herbs' location.

357
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,080
I was ambushed.

358
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,200
All I know is

359
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,840
that it's the same group
of people who hurt me before.

360
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,280
I suspect there are traitors.

361
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,320
What a coincidence.

362
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,479
This concerns the lives
of thousands of soldiers.

363
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:50,479
It is

364
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
Xuan from the Winery.

365
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,039
We can't just rob him.

366
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,840
I have a way

367
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,359
to get back the herbs without battle.

368
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,880
I'll give you two choices too.

369
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,320
Either you kill me,

370
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,799
or I kill you.

371
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,760
Ruomu Puppet.

372
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,640
I've got other things to do.

373
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,039
Let's call it a day.

374
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,440
How are you doing?

375
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,359
You alright?

376
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:05,799
Do you need to treat injuries?

377
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:08,359
Do you know Xuan's real identity?

378
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,320
I might have guessed.

379
00:16:10,624 --> 00:16:11,200
What?

380
00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:13,559
If I guess right,

381
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,280
you'll be probably in danger.

382
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,159
Why?

383
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:17,559
You kidnapped his sister.

384
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,599
And it's unforgivable.

385
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,159
He definitely wants to kill you.

386
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,520
Before I can get rid of him,

387
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,640
you stay with me.

388
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,440
No, thanks.

389
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,960
My men have received
the medicinal materials

390
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,960
and safely retreated.

391
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,600
Alright.

392
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,000
Then I'll take her back.

393
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:31,880
Let's part ways

394
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,760
here.

395
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,960
Farewell.

396
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,159
We might meet again if possible.

397
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:37,080
If not,

398
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,359
just forget about me.

399
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:40,080
What I want is your blood,

400
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:40,960
not you.

401
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:50,760
Master Qingqiu,

402
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:51,760
I heard about you.

403
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,479
What can I do

404
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,520
for you?

405
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,520
I want you

406
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,520
to get Wen Xiaoliu out.

407
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:58,159
I once asked him to go with me,

408
00:16:58,919 --> 00:16:59,760
but he refused.

409
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,440
I'm here to make a deal with you.

410
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:02,960
As long as you help me with it,

411
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,439
you can name your price.

412
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,000
You are

413
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,239
very generous.

414
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,000
What if I ask a fortune for that?

415
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,680
Whether or not
you take the deal is up to you.

416
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,560
Whether or not
I can afford the reward is up to me.

417
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,280
I'm responsible for killing,

418
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,439
and you're for saving.

419
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,439
I didn't poison Nian.

420
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:21,920
But I did it to Xuan.

421
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,359
It's not poison

422
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,359
but a poisonous bug.

423
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,479
To control

424
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:27,800
Xiang Liu.

425
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,119
That nine-headed demon.

426
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:31,119
I racked my brains
thinking of this method.

427
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:32,119
Unexpectedly,

428
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:33,319
I planted it in Xuan,

429
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,599
not in him.

430
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,520
Thanks for taking care of Xiaoliu.

431
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:37,680
I'll take Xiaoliu away

432
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,880
when things settle down.

433
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:40,359
That depends on

434
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:41,839
whether he is willing to go with you.

435
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,239
Xiang Liu.

436
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,560
Xiang Liu.

437
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:46,880
Xuan is here.

438
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,040
I know.

439
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,280
Xuan is here.

440
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:50,040
Nine-headed demon.

441
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,079
You must come back alive.

442
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:57,359
Get ready.

443
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,239
- Yes.
- Yes.

444
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:01,079
My target is Wen Xiaoliu,

445
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:01,839
not you.

446
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,479
I just want to kill you.

447
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,400
Let's see if you can.

448
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,319

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,560

Why did you save Xuan?

469
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,760
A few days ago, I was wondering

470
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,400
why you are so idle,

471
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,199
watching me recover
from my injuries every day.

472
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:02,640
Then I found out

473
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,959
you were not looking after me,

474
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:05,560
but waiting for Xuan.

475
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,560
Tushan Jing asked me
to hide in the mountain

476
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,280
because

477
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,239
he knew

478
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,280
you and Xiyan

479
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:11,760
were fighting for hundreds of years.

480
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:12,959
So,

481
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:14,719
you used me as a bait,

482
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,040
trying to lure and kill him.

483
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:16,880
So what?

484
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:18,959
If I had killed him for you,

485
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,920
the King of Xiyan

486
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:22,439
would definitely avenge him
with all his might.

487
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:24,160
Then I would never have

488
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,040
peace.

489
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:30,800
So you know

490
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,479
that I want to kill him at all costs.

491
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,800
If you want to kill me,

492
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:36,800
just do it.

493
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,719
Killing you

494
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
would be too easy for you.

495
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,959
Your Lordship,

496
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:22,800
I am a man.

497
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,800
Are you?

498
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:26,359
If you are,

499
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,280
how did you manage to lure Feifei out?

500
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:30,359
I don't believe

501
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:32,359
you can't change
your appearance and voice.

502
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,800
What illusion technique are you using?

503
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:38,199
With low spirit power,

504
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:40,599
you can make it untraceable.

505
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:43,479
Everything seems real.

506
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:49,079
My body is real.

507
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,680
Come on.

508
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:56,880
Touch it.

509
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:57,800
Come on.

510
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:58,400
Come on.

511
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,359
Touch it

512
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,000
only if you won't suspect

513
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,040
that I'm a woman anymore.

514
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:06,839
I'm not interested in your fake body.

515
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:10,848
Well, I...

516
00:22:11,239 --> 00:22:12,680
I didn't mean it.

517
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:25,959
Come on. Let's eat.

518
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,160
Eat more.

519
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,239
It is really delicious.

520
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,920
Seems your wounds
have completely healed.

521
00:22:35,199 --> 00:22:36,079
(I'm afraid of loneliness.)

522
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:37,880
(If I can't find
enduring companionship,)

523
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,800
(brief one is also good.)

524
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,000
It's been a long time.

525
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,280
I want to ask you something.

526
00:23:04,719 --> 00:23:06,040
Recently, I met a poisonous bug.

527
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,040
It can make the receiver

528
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,199
suffer the same pain
as the one who places it.

529
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:10,520
If the receiver is injured,

530
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,119
it has no effect
on the one who places it.

531
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:13,599
If it really is a girl,

532
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,959
it's a pair of couple poisonous bugs

533
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,439
planted for her lover.

534
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:20,520
You're not going
to throw me down from here, are you?

535
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,000
What about I use you as a cushion?

536
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:26,839
No.

537
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:29,839
Rumor has it

538
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:31,719
that couple poisonous bugs
are hard to raise.

539
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,640
One is male, and the other is female,

540
00:23:33,719 --> 00:23:34,680
equal in power.

541
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,520
The raiser

542
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,599
cannot control the poisonous bug.

543
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:40,680
(I don't hate you.)

544
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:41,839
(Because)

545
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,359
(I'm lonely.)

546
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,000
(Then I met a snake demon.)

547
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:48,119
(But even knowing the danger,)

548
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:50,160
(I still provoked it all the time.)

549
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,680
(Because only it)

550
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,560
(could understand what I was saying.)

551
00:24:16,439 --> 00:24:17,319
Mission completed.

552
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,800
You will share half the credit

553
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:19,760
and a great reward.

554
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,400
If you kill me and Xuan will die

555
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:22,400
accordingly,

556
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:24,079
you would kill me
without hesitation, right?

557
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,719
Since you care about Xuan so much,

558
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,199
why don't you remove the bugs?

559
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:28,959
Do you think I don't want?

560
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,400
I can't.

561
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:31,439
You are a demon.

562
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,800
So you must have some understanding

563
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:33,959
of the poisonous bugs, right?

564
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,160
The only method

565
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:38,160
is to lure the bugs
to someone else's body

566
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,160
to scourge someone else.

567
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:40,520
The only one I want to scourge

568
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,520
is you.

569
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:48,599
I will kill Xuan
before he leaves Qingshui Town,

570
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,719
so you don't have to
worry about how to solve it.

571
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,880
Why do you want to kill him?

572
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:53,839
It's a matter of position.

573
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:55,319
I wonder what kind of person

574
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:56,560
Hong Jiang really is.

575
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,079
He could make you, a demon,
grow a conscience.

576
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,239
Didn't you always say

577
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:02,319
that you hate it when others

578
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,000
call you a nine-headed monster?

579
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,119
What I hate

580
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,959
is not them talking about me
being a monster,

581
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,640
but their underlying contempt

582
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:10,760
and disdain.

583
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,800
I allow you to do it

584
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:13,199
because...

585
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,160
Because you make fun in your mouth,

586
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,959
but in your heart,

587
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:25,920
you never thought
that a nine-headed demon is weird.

588
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,800
I used to be weirder than you.

589
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:29,359
So you hid in the deep mountains,

590
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,079
and didn't see anyone?

591
00:25:36,479 --> 00:25:38,319
Are we having a heart-to-heart talk
under the moon,

592
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,280
trying to get along?

593
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:43,959
Before you irritate me again,

594
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,079
I suppose so.

595
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:46,199
What a pity.

596
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,280
Harmonious moments are always short.

597
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,640
Beautiful things

598
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:51,640
never last long.

599
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,680
I heard Xuan got better.

600
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,000
Did you save him?

601
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,199
He was in danger twice.

602
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:03,160
You saved him twice.

603
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,199
Anything is bothering you?

604
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,319
I was thinking

605
00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:07,839
about how to remove the poisonous bug

606
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:09,000
from Xuan.

607
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,920
Find another person

608
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,800
and lure the bug into him.

609
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,959
Not anyone can do it.

610
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:14,520
Why?

611
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,599
You raised the poisonous bug.

612
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,199
You don't know why?

613
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,319
Many years ago,

614
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:19,599
I met

615
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:20,800
a dying old woman.

616
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,119
I gave her a bath.

617
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:23,920
I cleaned her up nicely

618
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,719
and sent her to meet her lover.

619
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:26,520
She gave me

620
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,359
a walnut as a reward,

621
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,079
and inside it was a pair
of poisonous bugs.

622
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:31,119
Nonsense.

623
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:32,920
The only way to remove the poisonous bug

624
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,800
from Xuan is

625
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,520
to lure it into another person.

626
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,760
Mostly,

627
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,239
women raise it

628
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:39,319
for their lovers.

629
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:40,560
Once planted,

630
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:42,479
the couple will live

631
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:43,719
and die together.

632
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:45,119
Will it work if there's no love

633
00:26:45,239 --> 00:26:45,880
between the couple?

634
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,199
No, no, no.

635
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:48,839
(Even so,)

636
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,400
(there would be endless trouble.)

637
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:51,920
(Once you give your heart,)

638
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:54,319
(you can never take it back.)

639
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,880
You're a nine-headed demon.

640
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:57,760
Can you do me a favor

641
00:26:57,839 --> 00:26:59,880
and lure the poisonous bug into you?

642
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:02,040
I can help you,

643
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:02,959
but you have to promise

644
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:04,719
you'll help me
with one thing in the future.

645
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,920
As soon as I say it,

646
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:06,880
you can't refuse.

647
00:27:07,616 --> 00:27:08,199
Deal.

648
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,280
If you break the oath,

649
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,319
all your pleasures

650
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:13,479
will turn into pain,

651
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:16,119
and all your happiness

652
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:18,599
will turn into sorrow.

653
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,719
If I lure the poisonous bug out,

654
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,119
right now,

655
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:23,400
you're a bit too far away.

656
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,280
We need to go

657
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,479
to the Wushen Mountain in Haoling.

658
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,920
The Wushen Mountain
is where King of Haoling resides.

659
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,040
It's heavily guarded.

660
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,599
We'll go by sea.

661
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,800
I guess we could avoid the guards.

662
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:40,000
We've reached the sea area
of Wushen Mountain.

663
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,800
