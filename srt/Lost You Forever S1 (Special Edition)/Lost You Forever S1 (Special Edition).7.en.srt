00:00:05,056 --> 00:00:07,296
(Lost You Forever S1 Special Edition 7)

3
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:11,319
Both of you, please come out.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,319
No need.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,279
I can do it.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,399
You lowly person.

7
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:24,879
You lowly man,
how dare you offend princess.

8
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:25,799
Beat her up.

9
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:27,520
You can't enter.

10
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:34,080
Go and inform His Majesty.

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,599
Tushan Jing.

12
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:39,880
Yes.

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,720
I remember you
and Fangfeng Yiying had an engagement.

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,360
Did I remember that wrong?

15
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,880
No.

16
00:00:45,919 --> 00:00:47,200
You mean you have no engagement,

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,479
or I didn't remember that wrong?

18
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:51,159
You didn't remember it wrong.

19
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:52,599
Father.

20
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:56,959
My father told me

21
00:00:56,959 --> 00:00:59,400
that my look changed
because of a rare weapon

22
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:02,159
sealed in my body
rather than a rare disease.

23
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,639
Once he gets it out,

24
00:01:03,639 --> 00:01:05,160
I will go back to normal.

25
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,040
That's good.

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,599
What if

27
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,680
I am really ugly,

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,800
what will you do?

29
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:12,720
You are not.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,040
What if I am?

31
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,319
Very good.

32
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:16,360
You'd find it good

33
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,360
if I'm ugly?

34
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,120
Everyone can tell if you're pretty.

35
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:20,440
But your inner beauty

36
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,760
can't be seen with eyes.

37
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,919
I'll keep it to myself.

38
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,000
What inner beauty?

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,879
I'm very dark.

40
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,440
What I find pretty

41
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,440
may seem ugly to others.

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,199
It's very personal.

43
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:32,480
There is no right and wrong.

44
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,319
Xiaoliu, I have to go.

45
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,000
I've been worried about you.

46
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:37,400
But seeing

47
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,080
that His Majesty
and Cang Xuan are nice to you

48
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,319
and that you're happy,

49
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,360
I feel relieved.

50
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,599
I have to go back and work on my things.

51
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,120
Take care.

52
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,000
I will.

53
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:54,559
In 15 years,

54
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:56,519
don't open up your heart to another man.

55
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,760
Fifteen years.

56
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,919
I'll wait for you.

57
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,400
Miss Fangfeng,

58
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,680
let's cancel the marriage.

59
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,639
What did you say?

60
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,320
We barely know each other.

61
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,800
We're not in love.

62
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,199
Our marriage is only meant
to connect our families.

63
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,639
It's good for us to cancel it.

64
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,119
The world knows

65
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,279
how I feel about you.

66
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,199
How can you do this to me?

67
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,559
Once we cancel the marriage,

68
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:22,679
my family will keep supporting yours.

69
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,320
Apart from that,

70
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,880
I will try my best

71
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,399
to give you whatever you want.

72
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:30,559
What I value is you.

73
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:32,919
You haven't even seen me before.

74
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,600
You have no idea what I'm like.

75
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:36,880
Miss Fangfeng,

76
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,119
I have hidden injuries

77
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,479
and no great ambitions.

78
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:41,479
I'm not the right man for you.

79
00:02:43,136 --> 00:02:44,279
(Chenrong Mansion)

80
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:46,160
How come you suddenly
want to host a banquet?

81
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,240
I want to use your mansion
to host a feast.

82
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,360
This is a good chance
to make acquaintance.

83
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,360
Great, I love making friends.

84
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:55,800
Fenglong, let me introduce you.

85
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,559
This is Xuan
from the Dragon Squad of Haoling.

86
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,360
This is his cousin, Wen Xiaoliu.

87
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:00,240
Nice to see you.

88
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:01,119
Nice to see you.

89
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:03,199
Xuan.

90
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,720
Xuan, these are Chishui Fenglong
and Chenrong Xinyue.

91
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,639
Nice to meet you, Mr. Chishui

92
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:09,839
and Miss Chenrong.

93
00:03:10,784 --> 00:03:11,479
Jing.

94
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:16,039
Yiying, why are you only here now?

95
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,679
Take a seat next to Jing.

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,199
I was feeling a bit unwell earlier.

97
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,559
Jing...

98
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,199
Jing's always been considerate
and thoughtful towards Yiying,

99
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:24,839
so admirable.

100
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:27,160
We're all waiting
to take part in your wedding.

101
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,399
He's recovered from an illness

102
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:30,520
and can't drink much.

103
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,000
I'll drink this one for him.

104
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,639
Yiying truly cares deeply

105
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,520
for Jing.

106
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,600
Excuse me, I need to change.

107
00:03:45,344 --> 00:03:46,199
(Yiqing Garden)

108
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,479
Tushan Jing wants to see you.

109
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,479
He said he'd wait
outside Dragon Bone Prison.

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,679
Yes.

I'm willing to care about you.

170
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,320
I will give it up.

171
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,079
I don't like Fangfeng Yiying.

172
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:49,000
And she's not into me, either.

173
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,239
Since she doesn't want you,

174
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:51,799
you can come back to me as Ye Shiqi.

175
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:53,119
I'll be happy too.

176
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:55,160
I'm very happy to hear that.

177
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:56,959
But,

178
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,679
I want to formally ask your father
to give you to me.

179
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:02,839
Xiaoyao.

180
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,320
Give me some more time,

181
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:07,679
so I can stand before you with dignity.

182
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:10,959
I also want
to introduce you to my father.

183
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,399
Actually,

184
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,200
sending you the green plum wine
is not just my selfishness.

185
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,480
I hope when you receive the wine,

186
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:21,279
you'll know that I'm missing you.

187
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:29,959
Please cancel my engagement
with Miss Fangfeng.

188
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,160
What do you mean?

189
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,440
Miss Fangfeng and I had never met

190
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,679
when my mother arranged
our engagement from her sickbed.

191
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,640
I know these years,
she has been serving you

192
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,079
and has worked hard

193
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,040
to manage the household.

194
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:41,799
But I have no feelings for her,

195
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:43,000
and she has no interest in me.

196
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,760
Shut up.

197
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,239
It's true that you have
no affection for her,

198
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:47,399
but she has for you.

199
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:50,440
Yiying came to Qingqiu
in a wedding dress.

200
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,359
All these years,
she's had no legitimate status.

201
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:53,399
If you cancel the engagement,

202
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:55,040
what about her reputation?

203
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,079
What about
the Fangfeng Family's reputation?

204
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,480
If we break our promise,

205
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,559
what about our family's reputation?

206
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:03,320
Are you going
to let our family bear the stigma

207
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,799
and be ridiculed
by all the people in Dahuang

208
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,679
because of you?

209
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,640
I know I'm selfish.

210
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,279
I'll give up the position
as family leader

211
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,480
and bear the reproach

212
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,119
just to cancel the engagement.

213
00:08:15,168 --> 00:08:15,720
You...

214
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,239
Grandmother.

215
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,119
Grand Madam.

216
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,040
Jing.

217
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:23,640
Did you travel all the way to Zhiyi

218
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,640
just to persuade me to follow Cang Xuan

219
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,839
and join him in his great cause?

220
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,839
Yes.

221
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:29,640
Fifth King Deyan

222
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,679
and Seventh King Yuyang

223
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:32,679
have been running the Xiyan court
for centuries.

224
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,719
They have entrenched position

225
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:35,320
and great power.

226
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,799
Cang Xuan, however, is weak

227
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,280
with flimsy foundation.

228
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,400
He is not a match for the two kings.

229
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,679
Since you know it,

230
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,400
why do you still advise me
to ally with Cang Xuan?

231
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,559
Throughout history,

232
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:45,919
people are easy to do a favor

233
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,359
but hard to provide timely help.

234
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,200
If we judge the future
based on current situation,

235
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,520
we can only maintain the status quo.

236
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,960
If we want to realize our ambitions,

237
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,559
we must carve out a different path.

238
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,520
I'm surprised

239
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,679
to hear that from you.
You've been modest

240
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,479
and prudent.

241
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,559
Fenglong,

242
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,280
are you content to live
under the protection of your ancestors,

243
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,159
being a do-nothing leader
of the Chishui Clan?

244
00:09:07,072 --> 00:09:08,832
(Tushan)

245
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,760
(Xiaoyao,)

246
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,119
(what are you doing now?)

247
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,320
(Have you ever thought of me?)

248
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,239
Master.

249
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,239
A message from Xiyan Town.

250
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,200
(Master.)

251
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,000
(Great Princess of Haoling
and Fangfeng Bei are quite close.)

252
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,239
(They hung out)

253
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:25,359
(together)

254
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,559
(in the streets,)

255
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,679
(and stayed out late.)

256
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:29,080
(No matter how good something is,)

257
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,200
(if it's not worth it,)

258
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,599
(I will give it up.)

259
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,119
Master.

260
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,320
You must be exhausted.

261
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,119
Brother.

262
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:45,479
Stop.

263
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,280
Brother.

264
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,080
Sister.

265
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,919
It's been a long time.

266
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,280
The Tushan Family has a residence here.

267
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,559
If you want,

268
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:52,840
you can live with us.

269
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,679
The residence is big

270
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,200
without restrictions.

271
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,599
It would be my honor.

272
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,760
I have to take Xiaoyao back.

273
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,919
I'll move in tomorrow.

274
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:01,479
I can give you a ride.

275
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:02,400
Bei and I

276
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,479
just sat in the casino for hours.

277
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,559
Now we want to walk.

278
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,000
We have to go.

279
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,239
I heard Bei
and Great Princess are close.

280
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:11,719
I didn't expect it to be true.

281
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:18,679
Cang Xuan said you were looking for me.

282
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:20,119
This is...

283
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,520
It's a purple fish core?

284
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,239
I wanted to find you a red one.

285
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:25,000
This purple one is not precious,

286
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,400
but it's also hard to get it.

287
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,039
I only found a purple fish core.

288
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,400
It's not easy to find this, right?

289
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,200
Not at all.

290
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,200
When giving gifts to other girls,

291
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,159
you should say

292
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:37,599
you have spent much effort on this.

293
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,119
It will make your gift better.

294
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:39,919
No.

295
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,559
Only you.

296
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,359
Xiaoyao.

297
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:45,799
Every time I decide to give up on you,

298
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,599
you always find a way to soften me.

299
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,640
I know I shouldn't show up.

300
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,320
You're such a fool.

301
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,679
I don't understand
why people say you're clever.

302
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,400
And that. Why didn't you catch it?

303
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,960
What if it breaks?

304
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
It won't break that easily.

305
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,799
I dare not accept your gift.

306
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,520
I'm afraid it'll be
like the green plum wine.

307
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,840
Suddenly disappearing

308
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,919
after I get used to it

309
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,119
without even an explanation.

310
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:07,679
Someone by my side has become disloyal.

311
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,679
Before I find it out,

312
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,039
I'm afraid to cause you trouble.

313
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,559
So I stopped sending the wine over.

314
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,799
Last time I saw you,

315
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,119
you complained
that I was trying to smother you.

316
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,760
I tried hard to restrain.

317
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,320
Do you really want
to cancel the engagement?

318
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,880
I promise.

319
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,000
My grandmother wanted us

320
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
to get used to relating
as brother and sister.

321
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,479
She said to find an opportunity

322
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:28,119
to discuss with the Fangfeng Family
about canceling the engagement.

323
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,440
Alright.

324
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:30,960
Then I will accept

325
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,280
this purple fish core now.

326
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:36,760
Draw me two pictures.

327
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,320
As if you're afraid I will forget.

328
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,200
I...

329
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,400
That's not what I meant.

330
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,039
I didn't mean to forbid you.

331
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,880
I didn't...

332
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,320
I know.

333
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,200
I did tell you to be careful.

334
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,880
Drink this,

335
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,239
and you'll be able to move soon.

336
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,159
Back then,

337
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:06,840
it was your care

338
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,359
that kept me alive.

339
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,880
Your coronet is crooked.

340
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:13,719
Your hair is much better than before.

341
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,119
Who takes care of your hair now?

342
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:18,840
Is it Jing Ye or Lan Xiang?

343
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,760
Neither.

344
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,159
You have other maids?

345
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:22,919
I do it myself.

346
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:24,679
I don't want others do it for me.

347
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,640
Let me do it for you in the future.

348
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,239
(Tushan)

349
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:32,679
I already have someone I love.

350
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:35,119
I will confess all my faults
to the public

351
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:36,799
to minimize the harm to you.

352
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,000
You will cancel the engagement.

353
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:39,520
How do you minimize the harm?

354
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,919
Grandmother takes you
as her granddaughter.

355
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,919
As the lady of Tushan Family,

356
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,440
you'll have another good match.

357
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,200
My family will provide you

358
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,960
with a generous dowry.

359
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,359
The Fangfeng Family

360
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:49,760
won't suffer losses.

361
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,960
Everything has been arranged.

362
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:56,760
Your wedding has been delayed
for so long.

363
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,559
We should arrange it.

364
00:12:58,599 --> 00:13:00,039
Whoever you like,

365
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:02,599
you can marry her.

366
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,799
But,

367
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:07,359
it must be
after your marriage to Yiying.

368
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:08,359
Grandmother,

369
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:11,200
you never planned
to cancel the engagement.

370
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:13,200
As long as I am alive,

371
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,919
I won't approve your breakup
with Yiying for marrying another woman.

372
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,520
I'd rather stay unmarried for life.

373
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:20,840
Stop!

374
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:29,200
Xiaoyao.

375
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,400
Xiaoyao.

376
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:54,239
Xiaoyao.

377
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:55,000
Please.

378
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:57,359
Open your eyes and look at me.

379
00:13:58,359 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm your Shiqi.

380
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:01,840
Xiaoyao.

381
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,520
Didn't we have a deal?

382
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,799
Didn't we agree that
I'll be with you forever?

383
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,479
You can't abandon me.

384
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:23,440
Master Tushan is dying.

385
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,400
I'm afraid he won't last a few days.

386
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,799
No matter what,

387
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,799
keep feeding him medicine.

388
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,000
I'll continue feeding him.

389
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:32,320
Why does he not want to live anymore?

390
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:34,320
I hope the princess is safe and sound.

391
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,039
Otherwise, I'm afraid Master...

392
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:36,960
(Chenrong Mansion)

393
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,640
Thank heavens,

394
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,599
you're finally back safe and sound.

395
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,679
Jing.

396
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:48,280
Please save Master.

397
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:50,440
Master is overly grieved.

398
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:53,919
His spirit is shattered
and his organs are all injured.

399
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:55,559
Jing is seeking his own death?

400
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,960
What happened while I was away?

401
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:01,400
You were so heartbroken
that you didn't want to live?

402
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,479
Back then, you've stopped breathing.

403
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,280
He would rather be burned by the fire

404
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,239
than leave you.

405
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,919
He wants to be with you,

406
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:13,200
dead or alive.

407
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,159
Can you wake up?

408
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:34,000
I like it when you're the wolf.

409
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,599
When did you sneak out?

410
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,039
You're its master.

411
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,440
It's crafty,

412
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:41,799
like you.

Xiaoyao.

00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,280
I don't want to be Tushan Jing anymore.

421
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,352
Whether I can be with you
openly and honorably is not important.

422
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,760
Even if I don't get recognition
for a lifetime,

423
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,919
even if I'm your servant for a lifetime,
it doesn't matter.

424
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,840
I just want to be by your side

425
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,000
to protect you.

426
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:31,880
Do you really see me

427
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,960
as important as your life?

428
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,599
You're more important than my life.

429
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:39,440
Xiaoyao.

430
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:40,760
I'm sorry.

431
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,080
Fool.

432
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,039
What I want is
that you will hold on to me,

433
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,200
no matter what.

434
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:52,719
Last night, I discussed
with several elders

435
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,599
and we decided to hold
a ceremony three days later.

436
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:58,960
Jing will serve
as the head of our family.

437
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:00,559
Grandmother,

438
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,200
let's talk about this matter
in a few years.

439
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,280
A few years?

440
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,199
This time, whether you want it or not,

441
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,560
you must take over as the head.

442
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,040
Please cancel the ceremony
three days later.

443
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,439
Grandmother.

444
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,119
I only have no more than six months

445
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,040
to live.

446
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,000
For the sake of our family,

447
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,800
please let her see the new family head

448
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,000
when she is clear-minded.

449
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,040
I thought no matter
how big this mansion was,

450
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,119
where there's a will,

451
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,599
there's a way out.

452
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,040
But I can never get rid of

453
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:37,160
this surname

454
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,839
as well as my bloodline.

455
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,839
The auspicious time has arrived.

456
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,920
The ceremony begins.

457
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,280
As it is shown

458
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,839
by the fate constantly,

459
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,760
alas, the clan leader
is virtuous and righteous.

460
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:55,560
Our next generations

461
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,479
follow our principles

462
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
and admire and carry on

463
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,680
the clan leader's great achievements.

464
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:08,839
As heaven sends an auspicious sign.

465
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,839
Heaven blesses Qingqiu Hill.

466
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,040
(Tushan Mansion)

467
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm a little dizzy.

468
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:17,680
Miss, what's wrong with you?

469
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,920
Miss Fangfeng, you're pregnant.

470
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,839
You're having Jing's baby.

471
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,560
I can die without regret.

472
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,680
(I'll believe you)

473
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,479
(if you shake your head.)

474
00:18:32,719 --> 00:18:33,520
(Tushan Jing.)

475
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,719
(It was Grandmother
who gave me the drug.)

476
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,920
I'll wait for Miss Fangfeng waking up.

477
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:41,880
Okay.

478
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:44,079
I'm sorry.

479
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:47,400
I don't hate you.

480
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:49,319
But between you and me,

481
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:50,880
the relationship ends here.

482
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,400

Xiaoyao is a good girl.

515
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:47,160
she can find someone
