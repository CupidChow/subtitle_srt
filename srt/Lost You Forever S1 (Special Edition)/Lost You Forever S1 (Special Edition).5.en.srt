(Lost You Forever S1 Special Edition 5)

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,079
Summon

4
00:00:08,399 --> 00:00:10,800
Wen Xiaoliu.

5
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:19,120
Who injured

6
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:22,280
your leg?

7
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:23,200
It was me.

8
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:24,959
He was trying

9
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:25,760
to escape,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,120
so I slightly punished him.

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,599
I'm a countryman.

12
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:35,200
It's my first time
seeing so much delicious food.

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:35,919
Please forgive me

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,400
if I behave improperly.

15
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:38,840
What do you like?

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,360
I'm not picky.

17
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,799
I eat anything like chitterlings,

18
00:00:41,919 --> 00:00:43,159
and chicken arse.

19
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:45,040
I've already asked the chef
to prepare Qingai Cake.

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,439
You can eat some

21
00:00:46,599 --> 00:00:48,040
while listening to a story before bed.

22
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:51,639
Your favorite Qingai Cake.

23
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:52,840
I want to eat it

24
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,599
while my mother tells me a story.

25
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:00,159
(He is Xiaoyao?)

26
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,744
Come on.

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,239

who grew up being taken care of

50
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,759
without seeing
the dark side of the world

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,440
and had whatever you wanted.

52
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,479
But now,

53
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,279
you're completely different

54
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,880
from what I imagined.

55
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,039
You're disappointed?

56
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,440
No.

57
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:48,160
You've seen the dark side of the world.

58
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,880
So I'm not worried

59
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,800
that I'd terrify you

60
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:51,960
with my true self.

61
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,360

00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,919
my best imagination.

64
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,639
I'm not that good.

65
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,320
I'm going back to Zhaoyun Peak.

66
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:06,960
It's good.

67
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:10,559
You have to go back, anyway.

68
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,679
Won't you go?

69
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,039
I wonder if the swing is still there

70
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:16,759
under the Poinciana tree.

71
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,279
If it's gone,

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,919
we'll make another one.

73
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,839
Okay.

74
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,199
Alright, let's make it the way it was.

75
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,360
The Zhaoyun Hall

76
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,080
used to be a happy place.

77
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,279

I'm no longer embarking on it

80

I decided to be the Princess of Haoling.

You changed your mind?

85
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,919
Are you doing it for me?

86
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:09,039
Not entirely.

87
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,080
Because I think

88
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,360
being a princess is not completely bad.

89

120
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:51,640
(Since you chose
to return to Xiyan Mountain,)

Wait.

133
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,640
You're not thinking about
pushing me down, are you?

134
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,304
You are right.

135
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:33,119

why didn't you let me help you

139
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,519
Because I was scared.

141
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:09,679

00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,200
You.

143
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,079
I was scared of you.

144
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,480
Kissing me would be
more terrifying than death?

145
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,119
Although...

146
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,799
Although the possibility is very small,

147
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,440
I'm still scared

148
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,079
that I might accidentally

149
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,640
let you into my dreams.

150
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,640
This is probably
more terrifying than death.

Where are you going, Xiang Liu?

152
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:00,040
Xiang Liu.

157

(And only me.)

158
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,679
Xiaoyao.

159
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,359
I know I'm not good enough for you.

160
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,200
There are many healthy

161
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,760
and handsome men.

162
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,200
Even if others judge you

163
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,760
by your appearance and wealth,

164
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,200
don't you know who you are?

165
00:08:48,288 --> 00:08:48,800
I...

166
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,280
A man forced me to kiss him.

167
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:53,799
But now,

168
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,640
I just want to kiss you.

169
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,559
No, Xiaoyao.

170
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,039
Xiaoyao, this liquor is strong.

171
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:22,919
You should drink fruit wine instead.

172
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,919
My brother

173
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:26,119
has never been considerate to me.

174
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,520
Jing, make a judgement.

175
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:29,840
Have you ever seen him
as thoughtful as he is today?

176
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,799
Never seen it.

177
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:32,559
Mrs. Tushan.

178
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,119
Help me shut his mouth up.

179
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:37,599
Jing, please.

180
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,559
Jing, you were not like this before.

181
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:41,159
Why are you so restrained today?

182
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:42,080
Jing.

183
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,000
Yiying may feel embarrassed.

184
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:47,520
This won't do.

185
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,520
Sorry, I punish myself
with three cups of liquor.

186
00:09:57,599 --> 00:09:59,039
Good. Let's drink.

187
00:09:59,232 --> 00:09:59,776
Come on.

188
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:05,520
You didn't dare to approach me
when everyone was here.

189
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:07,640
Now you dare to when everyone

190
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,000
has left?

191
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,400
You're Princess of Haoling
in front of them.

192
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,039
Now you're not.

193
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,640
What did you feel to be fed liquor?

194
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,000
I want to try it too.

195
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,440
I didn't drink the liquor she fed me.

196
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,392
I don't care.

197
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,039
Anyway, will you feed me or not?

198
00:10:25,184 --> 00:10:25,696
Yes.

199
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,400
When we drank in the cabin,

200
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,159
did you feel upset?

201
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,239
Yes.

202
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,559
Seeing Fenglong taking care of you,

203
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,919
I feel very upset.

204
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,159
I feel good to see you like that.

205
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:50,400
If you feel good,

206
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,080
I'll be happy too.

207
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:54,760
I'm willing to care about you.

208
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,799
But I'm not willing to do it
because of Fangfeng Yiying.

209
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,440
No matter how good something is,

210
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:01,880
if it's not worth it,

211
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,599
I will give it up.

212
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:05,760
Xiaoyao.

213
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,400
Give me some more time

214
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,799
so I can stand before you with dignity.

215
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,359
I also want to introduce you

216
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:14,719
to my father.

217
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,400
Please keep your heart to me.

218
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,159
I realize

219
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:26,440
you're a cunning man.

220
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,080
You sent me green plum wine.

221
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,200
Isn't it just a way

222
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,599
to remind me of our promise?

223
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,599
Sorry.

224
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:36,799
I have no choice.

225
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:39,159
I know you deserve better,

226
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,479
but I can't give up.

227
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:43,039
I understand.

228
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,559
I understand.

229
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,520
Sending you the green plum wine

230
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,080
is not just my selfishness.

231
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,119
I hope when you receive the wine,

232
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,679
you'll know that I'm missing you.

233
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:22,840
Are you tired?

234
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,280
Did you have fun with Tushan Jing?

235
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,479
I only chatted with him for a while.

236
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,640
But you.

237
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:36,719
Miss Chenrong

238
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,599
was quite interested in you.

239
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,359
She looked serious.

240
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:43,159
She looks serious

241
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,239
because I am Xiyan Cang Xuan.

242
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,799
I'm not in a position to judge her.

243
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:49,719
I don't refuse her

244
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,559
just because

245
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,599
she is Chenrong Xinyue.

246
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,840
Do you feel bad?

247
00:12:57,599 --> 00:12:58,679
How will it not be distressing?

248
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,440
But this is the price I need to pay

249
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,119
to return to Xiyan Mountain.

250
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:08,000
It must be a bloody path
returning to Xiyan Mountain.

251
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:10,359
Are you ready?

252
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,840
I must stand on Zhaoyun Peak

253
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:16,000
on my auntie's death
anniversary next year.

254
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,760
It's been so many years.

255
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:20,400
I haven't been back
to pay respects to my mother.

256
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,400
I don't know what the graves

257
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,520
of my parents,

258
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:24,719
auntie,

259
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,919
and grandmother

260
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,520
look like now.

261
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,200
Cang Xuan.

262
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:32,559
Let's

263
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:34,679
go home together.

264
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,440
Okay.

265
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,559
Let's go home together.

266
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,479
Great Princess, you must be tired
from your journey.

267
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:50,559
Princess, please.

268
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,080
Cang Xuan doesn't come with us?

269
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:53,640
Father didn't summon him.

270
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,479
Can't I really have Cang Xuan's company?

271
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:04,960
Please forgive me.

272
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,479
Since I'm not welcome in Xiyan,

273
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,280
set off

274
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,760
and return to Haoling.

275
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:09,792
Princess,

276
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:10,840
don't mess around.

277
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,159
Am I messing around?

278
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:13,799
Your soldiers

279
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,119
drew their weapons against me

280
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,400
and stopped me getting in.

281
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,679
Who's messing around,

282
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,479
me or rude men from Xiyan?

283
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,799
Princess, you misunderstood.

284
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:25,280
No one dares to stop you
from entering the city.

285
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,679
Please.

286
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:44,159
Brother.

287
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,239
You agreed to attend the banquet

288
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:45,880
held by Yue Liang?

289
00:14:45,888 --> 00:14:46,432
Yes.

290
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,239
You must not go.

291
00:14:47,599 --> 00:14:48,440
Difficulties

292
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,840
makes me reach the summit.

293
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
I'll go with you.

294
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,559
Bring your best guards.

295
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:53,344
Okay.

296
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,559
Xiang Liu,

297
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:04,479
what are you doing here?

298
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,880
You mistook me for someone else.

299
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,919
(The poisonous bug
didn't respond at all.)

300
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,679
You're really not him?

301
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,919
If you're willing to drink with me,

302
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:17,479
I can pretend to be him.

303
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,719
Okay.

304
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,080
You poisoned me?

305
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:49,840
(He's really poisoned.)

306
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,840
With you holding my hand like this,

307
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:53,200
how could I refuse

308
00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:55,000
whatever you ask me to do?

309
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:56,760
You really aren't afraid of death.

310
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,559
It depends on who's hands I'm dying by.

311
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,520
Antidote.

312
00:16:07,328 --> 00:16:07,880
Feed me.

313
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,159
Why did you poison me?

314
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,000
Sorry,

315
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,280
I mistook you for someone.

316
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,440
It often happens?

317
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,400
That's not good.

318
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,760
How can I let you go?

319
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,400
What do you want?

320
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,960
I want you to remember me.

321
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:51,880
Fang

322
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:55,200
Feng

323
00:16:56,896 --> 00:16:57,400
Bei.

324
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:00,000
Remember my name.

325
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:02,479
Don't make a mistake again.

326
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:03,719
You're not him.

327
00:17:09,719 --> 00:17:10,719
It's a pleasure

328
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,680
to meet you tonight.

329
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:14,439
Fangfeng Family?

330
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,359
Cang Xuan.

331
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,880
Cang Xuan.

332
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,079
Xiaoyao.

333
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,479
Anyone!

334
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,439
Anyone!

335
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,280
Yu Jiang,

336
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:38,880
do you want to make
the Xihe Squad exterminated?

337
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,199
You are the Princess of Haoling.

338
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:42,560
How can you destroy the Xihe Squad
for an outsider?

339
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,359
What about you?

340
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,839
You conspired with outsiders
to assassinate Cang Xuan,

341
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:48,599
bringing disaster to your clan.

342
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,880
I didn't.

343
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,239
Cang Xuan beheaded my brother.

344
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:53,599
I must take his head
to mourn my brother.

345
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,959
Stop.

346
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,439
Xiaoyao.

347
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,680
Don't move!

348
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,800
Don't move!

349
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:28,760
Fangfeng Family.

350
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,800
Move away!

351
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:34,359
Don't move!

352
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,760
You can't, Xiaoyao.

353
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,280
Don't move!

354
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,760
Move away!

355
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,199
I am the Princess of Haoling.

356
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:41,640
They won't kill me.

357
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,160
Trust me.

358
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:44,560
Trust me.

359
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,719
Xiaoyao, move away!

360
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:48,319
Don't move!

361
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:51,280
Move away!

362
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,079

381
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,079
to be in danger again,

382
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:56,520
find a way

383
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:58,680
to eliminate potential danger.

384
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,280
I will try my best.

385
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,119
I will do whatever I can do.

386
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:06,304
♪It began like a tornado♪

387
00:20:06,624 --> 00:20:11,360
♪And went away leaving only dust♪

388
00:20:11,616 --> 00:20:13,216
(Xiyan Town)

389
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,160
Please send them to Qingshui Town.

390
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,239
Are you delivering goods?

391
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,119
Do you remember me?

392
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:30,439
Since I just escaped from your arrow,

393
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,800
it should be hard to forget you.

394
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:36,079
How could I shoot an arrow at you?

395
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,079
You must be mistaken.

396
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,319
Why are you following me?

397
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,920
I'm bored.

398
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,839
Do you want to see me shoot arrows?

399
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,839
I want to see your archery.

400
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,079
Follow me.

401
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,359
Are you trying
to shoot that pine tree in front?

402
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,119
People

403
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,079
make mistakes.

404
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:14,839
Go back.

405
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,599
Flowers for the beauty.

406
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,400
(His archery is astonishing.)

407
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,239
(If he truly intended
to kill us that night,)

408
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,920
(neither Cang Xuan
nor I would have escaped.)

409
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:28,160
Good archery.

410
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:29,239
Are you interested?

411
00:21:29,439 --> 00:21:30,520
If you are willing to teach,

412
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:32,119
I will be happy to learn.

413
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:34,000
Just use it as a target.

414
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:37,520
Stand upright.

415
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:39,680
Hold the bow correctly.

416
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:41,400
Set the arrow calmly.

417
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:42,880
Advance and retreat.

418
00:21:43,439 --> 00:21:45,800
Stretch it to its full extent.

419
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,040
If you were a master,

420
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,839
your disciples would like you.

421
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,280
My method is only suitable

422
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,400
for smart people.

423
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:57,880
I hit it again.

424
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,920
You really don't act like a princess.

425
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:02,319
You know it.

426
00:22:02,439 --> 00:22:03,680
I'm a wild princess.

427
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,959
Why not quit being a princess

428
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,199
and wander around with me?

429
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,359
Okay.

430
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:21,400
If you give up everything,

431
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,959
I'll go with you.

432
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,920
Don't try to fool me.

433
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,000
Don't think you're bolder than me.

434
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,439
What's wrong?

435
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:46,479
Do me a favor.

436
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:47,959
Can you investigate

437
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:50,359
into Fangfeng Bei's experiences
from his birth till now?

438
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,000
You're not really

439
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:53,959
attracted to him, are you?

440
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,959
What?

441
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,479
I'm just curious.

442
00:22:57,728 --> 00:22:58,272
Fine.

443
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,959
I'll let you know.

444
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,479
Why didn't you tell me
that you'd take the pills

445
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,239
made by the witch doctor?

446
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:05,959
I could

447
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,479
have prepared some antidotes for you.

448
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,040
To reassure my uncles

449
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:12,439
to exile me to the Central Plains,

450
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,160
I must make them believe

451
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,640
that I am already a useless person

452
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,079
and can't do anything more.

453
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:18,760
It's a slow-acting poison,

454
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,400
which will harm your internal organs.

455
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,839
But you're here, aren't you?

456
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,079
When can you stop doing it?

457
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:25,520
Apart from making my uncles believe,

458
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,119
I also need to wait for an opportunity.

459
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,199
Last time I left,

460
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,079
I thought I would be back soon.

461
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,880
I didn't expect it to be over 300 years.

462
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:35,040
This time,

463
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:36,560
I wonder how many years it will be

464
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,959
before I can return to Zhaoyun Peak

465
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,880
to swing.

466
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:40,880
I will plant phoenix trees
all over Zijin Peak

467
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,880
and build a swing for you

468
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,239
that's exactly the same.

469
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:44,000
Okay.

470
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:51,232
Brother.

471
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,880
Brother.

472
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,520
Brother.

473
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,880
I'm Xiaoyao.

474
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:06,319
I'm Xiaoyao.

475
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,104
Brother.

476
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,959
Bear it a little longer.

477
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:10,239
Please bear it.

478
00:24:15,959 --> 00:24:16,560
Brother.

479
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,439
Shall I sing the song you loved to hear

480
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:19,839
when you were young?

481
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:20,479
Okay?

482
00:24:20,576 --> 00:24:26,976
♪On the high mountain a vine grows♪

483
00:24:27,808 --> 00:24:33,978
♪On each section of it
hangs a copper bell♪

484
00:24:35,264 --> 00:24:39,760
♪When the wind blows,
the vine and the bell move♪

485
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,439
Brother.

486
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,040
Don't be afraid.

487
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,040
I'm here.

488
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:07,880
Brother.

489
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,000
Don't be sad.

490
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,800
I'm here for you.

491
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,760
You are with me.

492
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,479
I'm no longer sad.

493
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:22,719
Are you alright?

494
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:29,079
Brother.

495
00:25:29,439 --> 00:25:31,319
The poison in your body
has been completely removed.

496
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:32,520
Congratulations.

497
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,040
You have recovered.

498
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,199
Thank you.

499
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,400
Before my grandmother
revealed the truth,

500
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,880
he was once
the best brother in the world.

501
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,479
I know the securest way is to kill him,

502
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,319
but I can't do it.

503
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,119
I often complain
that you're too soft-hearted

504
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:54,680
and indecisive.

505
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:55,959
But deep down,

506
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:58,359
I'm quite happy
that you are soft-hearted.

507
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,760
I like you,

508
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:02,160
because you're different from us.

509
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,200
Can you

510
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:05,920
say it again?

511
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:08,719
You're different from us.

512
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,319
Not this one.

513
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,104
Well,

514
00:26:11,552 --> 00:26:12,128
I...

515
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,199
I like you.

516
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,040
Why are you nervous?

517
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:19,000
I know you like me.

518
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,000
What's wrong? Are you aggrieved?

519
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:23,040
Tell me.

520
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,800
I'll help you.

521
00:26:24,479 --> 00:26:25,119
Sister.

522
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,239
She is bullying me.

523
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,400
Shameless.

524
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,359
Who is your sister?

525
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,392
Sister.

526
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,560
Sister.

527
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:33,119
Alright,

528
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:33,640
stop it.

529
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,439
I said...

530
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,439
What I just said is...

531
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:39,920
I like you.

532
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,280
How's

533
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:49,199
your archery?

534
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:51,640
My grandfather found a master

535
00:26:51,719 --> 00:26:52,319
to teach me.

536
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,560
But his archery

537
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,000
requires strong spirit power,

538
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,239
not suitable for me at all.

539
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,000
After a few lessons,

540
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,400
I let him go.

541
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,199
I'll teach you.

542
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,119
You?

543
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,520
Xiangliu teaches me archery?

544
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:07,719
Are you scared?

545
00:27:08,479 --> 00:27:09,439
Why wouldn't I dare?

546
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:11,119
I dare to learn

547
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:12,839
from you.

548
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:16,880
Not bad.

549
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,199
You can use a better bow

550
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:19,520
to learn more sophisticated archery.

551
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:20,760
A better bow?

552
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,752
(Weapons Shop)

553
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,079
My brother and Xiaoyao.

554
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,079
Each bow has its own characteristics.

555
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:34,319
If you use it,

556
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,000
you must feel it

557
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:37,880
and work with it.

558
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,160
Brother.

559
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,880
What a coincidence.

560
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:49,119
Are you teaching archery?

561
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,719
Yes.

562
00:27:50,528 --> 00:27:51,040
Brother.

563
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,199
You've been training Xiaoyao
for a while now, haven't you?

564
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:54,680
Yes.

565
00:27:55,199 --> 00:27:56,439
Bei praised me for my progress.

566
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:58,040
So he brought me here
to choose a new bow.

567
00:27:58,959 --> 00:27:59,520
Brother.

568
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,079
You need to teach princess well.

569
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,839
Could you wrap it up?

570
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:04,880
Alright, alright.

571
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,336
Jing.

572
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,719
Can you pay

573
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:09,000
for my brother?

574
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:18,560
How can I let him pay?

575
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,599
If he pays,

576
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,760
this bow

577
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:23,439
will be a gift from him.

578
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,160
Any thoughts?

579
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,760
I appreciate your kindness.

580
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:33,719
But

581
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,920
I buy this bow for Xiaoyao.

582
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,760
So, I can't let you pay.

583
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,479
I was inconsiderate.

584
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,439
I shouldn't say that.

585
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,599
Thank you.

586
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,680
We'll be leaving.

587
00:28:47,199 --> 00:28:48,920
I'm sorry.

588
00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:51,239
I shouldn't have asked you to pay

589
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,520
without your consent.

590
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,880
I'm sorry.

591
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,359
Give me back the money.

592
00:29:07,439 --> 00:29:09,079
I know you don't care about the money.

593
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:12,040
I shouldn't have used you

594
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,040
to make Tushan Jing angry.

595
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:14,319
Please forgive me this time,

596
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:15,599
I won't dare to do this again.

597
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,512
Thank you.

598
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,760
Thank you.

599
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,560
Thank you.

600
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,584
Thank you.

601
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,352
Thank you.

602
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:21,239
Thank you.

603
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,119
Do you think if you keep waiting here,

604
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:26,680
I will soften and go see him?

605
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:27,880
I'm not like him.

606
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,839
Well...

607
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I am quite hard-hearted.

608
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,376
Xiaoyao.

609
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,359
Why are you bullying it?

610
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,599
I don't hate it.

611
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,400
Its owner is annoying.

612
00:29:42,432 --> 00:29:43,040
It looks

613
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,280
delicious.

614
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,359
It's poisonous.

615
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,680
What kind of hobby is this?

616
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:50,040
Are you cooking poison?

617
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,719
Your pharmacy is turning into a kitchen.

618
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,760
What is this?

619
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,880
Open it.

620
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,040
So, are you no longer angry?

621
00:30:09,199 --> 00:30:10,880
Can you continue

622
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,040
teaching me archery?

623
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:13,680
I have to leave for a while.

624
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,560
I'll teach you then.

625
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:17,160
Are you going back to Qingshui Town?

626
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,079
If you could always be Fangfeng Bei,

627
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:20,199
it would be great.

628
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,479
Xiaoyao.

629
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:49,640
Jing was ambushed on the way back

630
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,680
from Chief Liu's feast.

631
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:52,239
How is Jing?

632
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:53,319
His injuries must be severe.

633
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:54,400
I don't know if he's alive.

634
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,640
I asked Fenglong...

635
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,520
Stop.

636
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:57,680
I'll find Jing.

637
00:30:58,719 --> 00:30:59,239
Put on a coat.

638
00:30:59,239 --> 00:30:59,920
I'll go with you.

639
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,560
You fool.

640
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:12,680
I'm so worried about you.

641
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,560
You're here.

642
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,479
The Tushan Jing outside is your puppet?

643
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,599
I was supposed
to attend a banquet today,

644
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:18,959
but I haven't seen Xiaoyao yet,

645
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:20,119
so I let the puppet go.

646
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,800
Go back now.

647
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:22,719
Qingqiu is in chaos.

648
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,760
Brother.

649
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,599
Can I spend some time alone with Jing?

650
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:29,199
I'm sorry.

651
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,000
Grandmother promised
to cancel engagement.

652
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,719
But she suddenly changed her mind.

653
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,359
I must marry Fangfeng Yiying first.

654
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,000
You wish.

655
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:37,359
Xiaoyao.

656
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,239
Give me some more time.

657
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,119
I will definitely find a solution.

658
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,680
Don't focus on

659
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,400
cancelling your engagement for now.

660
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:46,119
Keep yourself safe first.

661
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,359
Someone

662
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:49,359
dared to assassinate you in Zhiyi.

663
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,959
The other party must try to kill you.

664
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,400
Remember

665
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,079
to be ruthless if you have to.

666
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,839
I understand.

667
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:03,079
I can't say your leg
can definitely be cured,

668
00:32:03,479 --> 00:32:05,079
but I'm sure it won't look abnormal.

669
00:32:05,199 --> 00:32:05,920
Do you mind it?

670
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:12,239
Do you think I mind it?

671
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:15,959
Xiaoyao.

672
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:17,640
As long as I have your eyes on me,

673
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,280
I won't be sad

674
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:20,599
about whatever others say.

688
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:18,144
Stop there.

689
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,439
My apologies.

690
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,400
Don't be nervous.

691
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,280
Get up.

692
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:24,160
It's okay.

693
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,239
Go on playing.

694
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,479
The plum blossoms here are beautiful.

695
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:37,959
Next time, we could invite Cang Xuan
to admire them.

696
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,760
Miao Pu.

697
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,040
Miao Pu.

698
00:33:46,439 --> 00:33:47,599
Someone has set up a formation.

699
00:34:03,199 --> 00:34:05,000
Don't you want me dead?

700
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:06,199
Go ahead.

701
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,800
Show me what else

702
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,479
you're capable of.

703
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,320
We've never met before.

704
00:34:13,479 --> 00:34:16,399
What have I done to you?

705
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,719
The entire Mu family...

706
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:19,439
Chi Chen wiped out your clan.

707
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,879
What does it have to do with me?

708
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,760
Today, we will kill his only daughter.

709
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,080
I have nothing to do with Chi Chen.

710
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,600
My father is the King of Haoling.

711
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,000
My father

712
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:52,439
is the King of Haoling.

713
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:15,280
Your Highness.

714
00:35:15,439 --> 00:35:16,520
How is she?

715
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,639
When will she wake up?

716
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,320
The princess passed away.

717
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:21,719
Don't talk nonsense.

718
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:24,800
Someone is barging in for trouble.

719
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,320
An old acquaintance.

720
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,040
Did you come all the way here

721
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:33,600
to kill me?

722
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,479
I'm not here to kill someone,

723
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:37,840
but to save an acquaintance
back in Qingshui Town.

724
00:35:39,439 --> 00:35:40,320
You can save her?

725
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,600
Let me take her.

726
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:43,000
I can save her.

727
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,280
Come with me.

728
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,679
Thankfully, you let so many people

729
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:48,919
keep giving her spirit power

730
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:50,639
and bought her some time.

731
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:52,080
How long do you need?

732
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:53,120
Maybe a year or two.

733
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,159
Maybe decades.

734
00:35:54,439 --> 00:35:55,159
Take her.

735
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:08,560
Where am I?

736
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Am I already dead?

737
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:17,040
So I can't leave my body?

738
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:19,679
Xiang Liu.

739
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,800
Are you the one who saved me?

740
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,120
I healed you
with my blood so many times.

741
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,320
Now it's time for you
to return the favor.

742
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,120
You were filled with poison.

743
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,239
And you cultivated with poison.

744
00:36:35,399 --> 00:36:37,159
The blood in your heart is deadly.

745
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:39,000
I'm afraid I'd be poisoned to death

746
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,439
before you can save me.

747
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,520
Xiang Liu.

748
00:36:42,048 --> 00:36:42,560
Xiang Liu.

749
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,320
No, no, no.

750
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:45,120
What are you doing?

751
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,399
I see.

752
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:47,600
I got it wrong.

753
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:52,040
Xiang Liu.

754
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:53,679
Xiang Liu.

755
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,600
Xiang Liu.

756
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:57,479
Please don't die.

757
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,679
Since you fell into a coma,

758
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:04,639
Tushan Jing has also been unconscious.

759
00:37:04,879 --> 00:37:06,600
But now he can't hold on much longer.

760
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:07,399
He's dying.

761
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:08,399
What's going on?

762
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:10,840
Xiaoyao, if Tushan Jing dies,

763
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,159
will you be very sad

764
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,159
and hate me?

765
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,399
But why would I hate you?

766
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,679
You saved me.

767
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:16,879
Xiang Liu.

768
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,320
Xiang Liu.

769
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,159
You can feel me, can't you?

770
00:37:38,399 --> 00:37:39,800
I'm back into my body.

771
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:49,239
Xiang Liu.

772
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,199
Where are you, Xiang Liu?

773
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,840
Xiang Liu.

774
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,280
Chubby!

775
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,159
Where's your master?

776
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,679
I don't see him.

777
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:03,080
Xiang Liu asked you to take me back?

778
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:30,719
Let's go.

779
00:38:37,504 --> 00:38:38,080
Your Highness.

780
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,919
The room has been arranged
according to your instructions.

781
00:38:41,088 --> 00:38:41,600
Very good.

782
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,520
Your Highness,

783
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,800
there's news about princess.

784
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,600
Where's she?

785
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,120
I'll go to her.

786
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:46,239
She went to Chenrong Mansion.

787
00:38:47,898 --> 00:38:49,984
(Chenrong Mansion)

788
00:38:50,919 --> 00:38:53,840
Princess, please save Master.

789
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:56,239
What happened while I was away?

790
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,639
When Prince Cang Xuan went to save you,

791
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,000
he saw Master holding you.

792
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,360
Back then, you've stopped breathing.

793
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,879
You were going to turn into ashes.

794
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,399
Master is proficient in formations.

795
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,959
He could get out of the formation.

796
00:39:11,879 --> 00:39:14,639
But he was holding you,
waiting for death.

797
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:16,919
Give me the medicine.

798
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,520
I'll feed him.

799
00:39:25,959 --> 00:39:26,760
(Jing.)

800
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,239
(Can you wake up?)

801
00:39:43,919 --> 00:39:44,760
Xiaoyao.

802
00:39:51,919 --> 00:39:53,080
Cang Xuan.

803
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:01,600
Jing.

804
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,320
They all say you didn't want to live

805
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,399
because I died.

806
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,040
Do you really care about me that much?

807
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,719
Do you really see me

808
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:11,120
as important as your life?

809
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,159
Will you never abandon me

810
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,679
no matter what happens?

811
00:40:21,399 --> 00:40:22,000
Jing.

812
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:24,040
Wake up soon.

813
00:40:24,794 --> 00:40:27,814
♪You're like the wind on the water♪

814
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:31,577
♪I'm like the lotus in the wind♪

815
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:35,008
♪Meet and miss♪

816
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,239
You're awake.

817
00:40:42,479 --> 00:40:43,080
Xiaoyao.

818
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:45,840
I've always wanted to be your husband,

819
00:40:45,959 --> 00:40:48,360
Only the identity of Tushan Jing
is worthy of you.

820
00:40:48,919 --> 00:40:49,840
But I was wrong.

821
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:51,520
I don't want to be Tushan Jing anymore.

822
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:53,520
I just want to be by your side.

823
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,520
Even if I'm your servant for a lifetime,

824
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,439
it doesn't matter.

825
00:40:56,919 --> 00:40:57,439
Jing.

826
00:40:58,239 --> 00:40:59,719
Do you really see me

827
00:40:59,919 --> 00:41:01,600
as important as your life?

828
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,439
Not the same.

829
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:05,080
You're more important than my life.

830
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:17,879
Jing.

831
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:23,919
Why are you all soaked?

832
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:26,159
Why don't you come in?

833
00:41:27,399 --> 00:41:28,080
Come in with me.

834
00:41:28,992 --> 00:41:29,568
Go.

835
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,679
Come in now.

836
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,639
What on earth happened?

837
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,239
Grandmother is ill

838
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:42,000
and she only has a few months left.

839
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,320
Grandmother wants me to succeed

840
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,439
as the head of the Tushan Family
in three days.

841
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:48,560
I can't refuse.

842
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:50,800
I understand.

843
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,080
I'm sorry.

844
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:54,479
It's okay.

845
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,879
If you really
so cruelly abandon everything,

846
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,600
including your grandmother
who has shown you great kindness,

847
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,120
even if it was for me,

848
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,959
you wouldn't be the Jing I like.

849
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:05,800
I'm sorry.

850
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,000
The shackles you can't break free of

851
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,280
are actually your gentleness.

852
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,280
And it is this gentleness

853
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:13,679
that makes me like you.

854
00:42:19,439 --> 00:42:20,239
Thinking about Tushan Jing?

855
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,239
No.

856
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:23,560
I just want to enjoy the breeze here.

857
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,439
It's from my master.

858
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,159
He lets you attend the ceremony
of Tushan Jing's succession.

859
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,840
Even if it has turned out this way,

860
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,000
you still want to meet him?

861
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,239
After all, this is
a once-in-a-lifetime event for him.

862
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,600
No matter what,

863
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,439
I want to go and see it.

864
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:36,719
Attend it if you like.

865
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,719
For me,

866
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,080
only your happiness matters.

867
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,080
Don't worry.

868
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,679
Happiness brings us together,

869
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:42,719
and sorrow sets us apart.

870
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,199
It's easy for us siblings

871
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,719
to move on.

872
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,320
I hope so.

873
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,959
You thought hope
was right in front of you,

874
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:54,919
but it turned out to be
getting further and further away.

875
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:55,840
Aren't you sad?

876
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,520
I can't say I'm not sad at all

877
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,639
against my mind,

878
00:42:58,679 --> 00:42:59,840
but I'm not that sad, either.

879
00:43:00,768 --> 00:43:01,312
Princess,

880
00:43:01,439 --> 00:43:02,199
would you like to go

881
00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:03,679
to find some real joy with me?

882
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,600
Why not?

883
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,080
Isn't that the young man
we saw in Xiyan Town

884
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:10,679
four decades ago?

885
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,479
He made a deal with the slave master.

886
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,959
If he wins consecutively for 40 years,

887
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:15,520
the slave master will set him free.

888
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,919
Tonight is the last night.

889
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,800
As long as he can survive tonight,

890
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:20,439
he can be freed from slavery.

891
00:43:29,879 --> 00:43:30,600
Stand up!

892
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,199
You've been waiting for 40 years.

893
00:43:32,399 --> 00:43:33,520
You'll be free

894
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,919
only by winning this time.

895
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,439
Stand up! Stand up!

896
00:43:37,959 --> 00:43:38,959
Stand up!

897
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,320
Stand up!

898
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,000
He won!

899
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:54,280
Let's go.

900
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,479
When you escaped from the death arena,

901
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,520
if I saved you,

902
00:43:57,719 --> 00:43:58,560
it would be great.

903
00:43:58,919 --> 00:44:00,199
If I saved you,

904
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,199
I would only let you be Fangfeng Bei,

905
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:03,959
a free Fangfeng Bei,

906
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,120
owing no one a favor

907
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,959
or gratitude.

908
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,800
You want to save me?

909
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,760
You're not worthy.

910
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:17,959
I just think

911
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:19,719
you were born to be as free as a bird.

912
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:20,280
Shut up.

913
00:44:24,576 --> 00:44:25,159
What's wrong?

914
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:26,959
Is my sister not good enough for you

915
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,760
because you're the clan leader now?

916
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,399
Miss Fangfeng is very nice,

917
00:44:31,399 --> 00:44:32,760
- but...
- Leave him alone. Let's go.

918
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:36,159
(Tushan Mansion)

919
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:37,080
The longevity poisonous bug

920
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:38,959
can't cure your illness,

921
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,439
but it can extend your life
by two to three years.

922
00:44:43,439 --> 00:44:44,080
I made it.

923
00:44:44,199 --> 00:44:45,560
Thank you, Princess.

924
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,719
Grand Madam, you're welcome.

925
00:44:47,488 --> 00:44:48,080
Miss.

926
00:44:48,439 --> 00:44:49,000
What's wrong?

927
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,479
I'm a little dizzy.

928
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:52,239
Princess, could you take a look?

929
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:55,120
Princess, how is my body?

930
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,360
Miss Fangfeng,

931
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:00,040
you're pregnant.

932
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:05,719
Grandmother.

933
00:45:05,879 --> 00:45:07,560
Please don't blame Jing.

934
00:45:07,959 --> 00:45:09,439
You're having Jing's baby.

935
00:45:10,439 --> 00:45:11,919
I can die without regret.

936
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,919
I can die without regret.

937
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:17,840
(I'll believe you)

938
00:45:18,479 --> 00:45:19,479
(if you shake your head.)

939
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:21,439
(Tushan Jing.)

940
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,679
(Deny it.)

941
00:45:28,439 --> 00:45:29,840
Congratulations, Grand Madam.

942
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,000
Congratulations, Grandma.

943
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,560
Same to you.

944
00:45:34,074 --> 00:45:37,879
♪I almost forgot about
the first time I met you♪

945
00:45:37,879 --> 00:45:38,439
Xiaoyao.

946
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,239
I...

947
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,479
Go ahead.

948
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,399
I'm listening.

949
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,560
One night more than three months ago,

950
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,639
it was Grandma who gave me the drug.

951
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,040
So it was Grand Madam.

952
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,560
Xiaoyao.

953
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,560
I'm sorry.

954
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,639
I don't hate you.

955
00:45:54,959 --> 00:45:57,520
But between you and me,

956
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,760
we are strangers now.

957
00:45:59,239 --> 00:45:59,760
Take care.

958
00:45:59,808 --> 00:46:03,200
♪The wind and rain beat down on me♪

959
00:46:03,488 --> 00:46:06,976
♪My eyes are wet♪

960
00:46:07,136 --> 00:46:10,399
♪The view is splendid♪

961
00:46:10,399 --> 00:46:11,040
Sister.

962
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,639
You're finally back.

963
00:46:12,768 --> 00:46:13,280
Sister.

964
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,600
Sister.

965
00:46:14,879 --> 00:46:16,120
- Xiaoyao.
- Nian, let go of her.

966
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:17,920
Xiaoyao.

967
00:46:18,479 --> 00:46:19,000
Xiaoyao.

968
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,040
Xiaoyao, don't scare me.

969
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,280
Anyone!

970
00:46:24,879 --> 00:46:25,719
Don't be grieved.

971
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,199
You deserve a better man

972
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:29,639
than Tushan Jing.

973
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,879
I'm not grieved because of him.

974
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,600
Have a good rest.

975
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,320
It'll be fine in a few days.

976
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,600
Once you're better,

977
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,360
I'll take you and Nian

978
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:41,840
to travel down the mountain.

979
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:45,840
Brother.

980
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,360
Don't leave me.

981
00:46:48,479 --> 00:46:49,280
I won't leave you.

982
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,520
I will always stay with you.

983
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,479
If you marry Miss Shen,

984
00:47:03,959 --> 00:47:04,840
it also means

985
00:47:04,879 --> 00:47:06,679
officially declaring war on your uncles.

986
00:47:06,919 --> 00:47:10,040
I'm worried that your uncles
will make a big fuss about this.

987
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,879
What if Grandfather
becomes suspicious of you?

988
00:47:12,959 --> 00:47:13,520
I understand,

989
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,399
but I have to take this step.

990
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:16,600
Xiaoyao.

991
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,040
Do not congratulate me

992
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,360
at the wedding.

993
00:47:21,568 --> 00:47:22,120
Okay.

994
00:47:22,778 --> 00:47:24,512
(Chenrong Mansion)

995
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,520
The magpie brings good news,

996
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:28,879
and flowers bloom together.

997
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,120
May you two be filled with love,

998
00:47:30,399 --> 00:47:31,800
and may you be blessed
with many children.

999
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,000
Congratulations.

1000
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,199
(Xiaoyao.)

1001
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,280
(Do not congratulate me at the wedding.)

1002
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:45,120
(This road is so)

1003
00:47:45,479 --> 00:47:47,360
(long as if it has no end,)

1004
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,600
(just like life itself.)

1005
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,600
(As a deity,)

1006
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,000
(I am still very young.)

1007
00:47:52,479 --> 00:47:53,840
(But I always feel like)

1008
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:56,000
(I'm already someone
nearing the end of her life.)

1009
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:04,639
I don't think we have a say in life.

1010
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,800
We have no control over our lives

1011
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
or deaths.

1012
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,360
If we don't have a say

1013
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,439
in these two things,

1014
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,199
why do we fight for and long for

1015
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,800
something else?

1016
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,399
You fool.

1017
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,399
We can't control life and death.

1018
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:22,320
That's exactly why we should

1019
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:24,520
have a say in everything

1020
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,040
between life and death.

1021
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,199
I'm tired.

1022
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,399
We've come this far.

1023
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,239
Won't you see the view from the peak?

1024
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,159
The view is indeed better here.

1025
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:34,879
Brother.

1026
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,280
Find a man for me.

1027
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,879
What kind of man?

1028
00:48:37,959 --> 00:48:39,520
Someone to live with,

1029
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:41,239
but he can't have another lover.

1030
00:48:41,399 --> 00:48:43,320
I no longer trust my judgment.

1031
00:48:43,439 --> 00:48:44,439
Choose for me.

1032
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:45,399
Okay.

1033
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:47,199
I know I can count on you.

1034
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:53,199
Jintian Valley's forging master is here.

1035
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,320
Do you have any requirements on weapons?

1036
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,760
There's only one.

1037
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:57,840
It should be deadly.

1038
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,399
I do have a weapon for you.

1039
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,879
This is the bow.

1040
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,239
What a nice bow.

1041
00:49:02,479 --> 00:49:04,280
Of course. But...

1042
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:05,360
But what?

1043
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,159
This bow needs to be tamed.

1044
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,560
It has a special requirement.

1045
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:14,800
It needs the blood
of the nine-headed demon.

1046
00:49:15,959 --> 00:49:18,199
I take this bow.

1047
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,479
Why didn't you pack any jewelry,

1048
00:49:20,479 --> 00:49:21,840
but took all the rare medicinal material

1049
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:22,679
from the palace?

1050
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,239
I need them to make medicine.

1051
00:49:24,439 --> 00:49:25,719
Since I need a favor,

1052
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:27,719
I must offer some gifts.

1053
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,360
Xuan is in deep trouble.

1054
00:49:29,479 --> 00:49:30,639
The Daming Hall collapsed.

1055
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,679
The King of Xiyan sent Xuan's archenemy

1056
00:49:32,879 --> 00:49:34,000
Yueliang to look into this.

1057
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,239
Yueliang

1058
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,760
will take a deadly strike now.

1059
00:49:37,399 --> 00:49:38,239
Shan Hu, Miao Pu.

1060
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,520
Pack up. We're going back.

1061
00:49:40,919 --> 00:49:41,439
Yes.

1062
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,439
Send it to my father.

1063
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:44,992
Hurry.

1064
00:49:44,992 --> 00:49:45,520
Yes.

1065
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:47,639
(Brother.)

1066
00:49:47,919 --> 00:49:49,479
(I will help you stay)

1067
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:50,919
(in the Central Plains at all costs.)

1068
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,840
Are you worried about His Highness?

1069
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,639
You're afraid the clans here

1070
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,120
will be severe on him

1071
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:56,840
for this incident.

1072
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:57,840
I am worried,

1073
00:49:58,199 --> 00:49:59,000
but I'm not afraid.

1074
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,280
I've been in an existential crisis.

1075
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,679
Cang Xuan and I

1076
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:07,719
have seen the blood.

1077
00:50:10,959 --> 00:50:13,560
I got this bow from the Jintian Family.

1078
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:14,919
What do you think?

1079
00:50:16,448 --> 00:50:17,120
Not bad.

1080
00:50:17,959 --> 00:50:19,159
But I haven't tamed it,

1081
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,199
I need three drops of blood from you

1082
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,000
to claim the weapon.

1083
00:50:23,439 --> 00:50:23,959
May I?

1084
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,479
If you want something, get it yourself.

1085
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:33,879
I made it.

1086
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,159
Congratulations.

1087
00:50:35,719 --> 00:50:36,360
You've mastered it.

1088
00:50:36,879 --> 00:50:37,879
From now on,

1089
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,000
you don't have to learn from me.

1090
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,479
Thank you for teaching me archery.

1091
00:50:45,439 --> 00:50:46,840
Xiaoyao, I beg you.

1092
00:50:47,399 --> 00:50:48,280
Leave.

1093
00:50:48,919 --> 00:50:50,840
Chenrong Mountain is dangerous now.

1094
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,199
No need to worry about me.

1095
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,679
King of Xiyan never raised me.

1096
00:50:55,159 --> 00:50:56,959
If he dares to come after us,

1097
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,199
I will fight back.

1098
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,120
If things go wrong

1099
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,479
and you can't do it,

1100
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,040
leave it to me.

1101
00:51:12,479 --> 00:51:14,600
I'll go with you.

1102
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:15,840
Does it make a difference?

1103
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,439
Even if you tell me to walk away,

1104
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,199
I'll secretly follow you to Zezhou.

1105
00:51:20,399 --> 00:51:21,040
Let's go.

1106
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:35,760
You'll defend. I'll attack.

1107
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,959
This is the last shot.

1108
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,439
Grandfather lives behind that.

1109
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,479
I was thinking the same thing.

1110
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,199
There are assassins.

1111
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,360
We came to your protection.

1112
00:51:58,439 --> 00:52:00,600
Not bad. Using someone's
strength against himself.

1113
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,639
Your escape plan
deserves a nice pot of wine.

1114
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:05,840
All thanks to the person

1115
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,360
who came up with the sneaky plan.

1116
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,719
You're the one who planned it?

1117
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,959
That's right.

1118
00:52:14,439 --> 00:52:15,239
See you around.

1119
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,239
Stay alert.

1120
00:52:18,919 --> 00:52:20,479
When are you going to marry Xinyue?

1121
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:21,919
Right now,

1122
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,439
she wouldn't even see me,

1123
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,600
let alone marry me.

1124
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:26,399
Apart from you silly girl,

1125
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,080
people only help me
to get things they want.

1126
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,320
Hop on. Piggyback.

1127
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:32,864
Let's go.

1128
00:52:33,639 --> 00:52:34,159
Brother.

1129
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,120
We must live a good life.

1130
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,144
Okay.

1131
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,360
What's the matter?

1132
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,520
Xiaoyao, let's get married.

1133
00:52:44,959 --> 00:52:45,959
I've wanted to marry you.

1134
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:47,080
I think you know it.

1135
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:49,560
Tell me the real reason
you want to marry me.

1136
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:50,600
I want to help Cang Xuan.

1137
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,080
But I must become the clan leader

1138
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:53,399
to mobilize the Chishui Family.

1139
00:52:53,399 --> 00:52:54,560
Marrying you is the fastest way.

1140
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:57,439
Because I'm Princess of Haoling, right?

1141
00:52:57,439 --> 00:52:58,399
It's not entirely like that.

1142
00:52:58,479 --> 00:53:00,879
Did Cang Xuan tell you about
the conditions for marrying me?

1143
00:53:00,919 --> 00:53:02,120
He said if I want to marry you,

1144
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:03,439
I should have no other women.

1145
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:04,879
Xiaoyao. I swear.

1146
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,080
As long as you marry me,

1147
00:53:06,199 --> 00:53:07,919
I'll only have you
as my woman in this life.

1148
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:09,840
It's too sudden.

1149
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:11,239
It's my marriage, after all.

1150
00:53:11,919 --> 00:53:12,919
Let me think about it.

1151
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:13,568
Okay.

1152
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:14,600
I'll wait for you.

1153
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,719
Why are you hesitating?

1154
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,919
Anyway,

1155
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,040
aren't you ready to accompany me?

1156
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:35,840
Xiyan Kingdom
is moving towards prosperity.

1157
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,040
It needs a new king.

1158
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:43,120
I have already cultivated
the best king for Xiyan.

1159
00:53:43,399 --> 00:53:46,600
I choose to abdicate.

1160
00:53:49,399 --> 00:53:51,439
Cang Xuan, come here.

1161
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:53,040
From today,

1162
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:57,560
Xiyan Cang Xuan is the king
of Xiyan Kingdom.

1163
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:02,919
Grandfather.

1164
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,760
Greetings, Your Majesty.

1165
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:08,719
Greetings, Your Majesty.

1166
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,719
Greetings, Your Majesty.

1167
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:13,840
Everyone, please rise.

1168
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1169
00:54:20,032 --> 00:54:20,600
Let's go.

1170
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:21,360
I'll help you.

1171
00:54:21,719 --> 00:54:24,639
Why are you dressed like this?

1172
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,919
I'd kill him as soon as you announce him

1173
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,159
as the Crown Prince.

1174
00:54:29,159 --> 00:54:31,360
You're actually my granddaughter.

1175
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:32,760
But grandfather,

1176
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,600
since you already decided
to pass the throne to Cang Xuan,

1177
00:54:36,199 --> 00:54:37,320
why didn't you tell him?

1178
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:38,479
What if he...

1179
00:54:38,919 --> 00:54:40,000
Aren't you afraid?

1180
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,239
You mean,

1181
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:46,959
Cang Xuan hid the elite troops
in Chenrong Mountain?

1182
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,280
So,

1183
00:54:49,439 --> 00:54:50,879
you knew it.

1184
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,399
If he launched a coup
to seize the throne,

1185
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,919
it would mean he is much like me.

1186
00:54:56,239 --> 00:54:59,399
He will be a good and decisive king.

1187
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,399
But he didn't.

1188
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,560
He's

1189
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,840
kinder than me.

1190
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,239
I hope

1191
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:10,919
he can bring more peace

1192
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,919
We stay in Chenrong Mountain

1193
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,919
and watch

1194
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:21,840
how Cang Xuan becomes a good king.

1195
00:55:24,128 --> 00:55:28,128
