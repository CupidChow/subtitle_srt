00:00:05,056 --> 00:00:07,296
(Lost You Forever S1 Special Edition 10)

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,840
The auspicious time has arrived.

4
00:00:09,239 --> 00:00:10,960
Let the ceremony begin.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,200
You two have traveled a long way.

6
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:42,479
Please have a seat.

7
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:43,959
This time, we came to see you

8
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:45,040
for important matters.

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:45,880
Feel free to speak.

10
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:47,959
Since you chose to return to Xiyan Town,

11
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:48,840
I suppose

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,279
you are determined to claim that throne.

13
00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:52,119
But you left the town
when you were young,

14
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:54,119
and your uncles have been ruling
for over 1,000 years.

15
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:55,360
I'm not looking down on you,

16
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:57,919
but what do you have
to compete with them?

17
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,720
If you have any suggestions,

18
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,119
feel free to speak.

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,360
Since Xiyan Town is already occupied

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,760
by your uncles,

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,000
with no place for you.

22
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,080
Why don't you give it up?

23
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:09,480
Giving it up?

24
00:01:12,199 --> 00:01:13,080
The North,

25
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,160
the West,

26
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,919
the South

27
00:01:15,279 --> 00:01:16,400
and the Central Plains

28
00:01:16,919 --> 00:01:17,879
now

29
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,120
belong to Xiyan.

30
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,440
Cang Xuan,

31
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,360
can you see clearly?

32
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,559
Do you see

33
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:25,239
the territory
that you would rule one day?

34
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,800
Yeah, I see it clearly.

35
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:28,040
Give up Xiyan Town

36
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,959
and come to us.

37
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,959
The center of the entire Dahuang
is the Central Plains.

38
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,160
Only by holding it,

39
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,720
can you overlook the entire Dahuang.

40
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,360
The North,

41
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,120
the West,

42
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,760
the South

43
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,559
and the East

44
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:37,519
are under its control.

45
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,559
One day,

46
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:39,959
if you want to march south,

47
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,639
it will also be easy.

48
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,639
In my lifetime,

49
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:46,839
I hope to see a real prosperous empire

50
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,160
that leaves a glorious legacy

51
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,519
throughout history.

52
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,599
Life is long.

53
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,879
Today we can only have a cup of water.

54
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:08,759
When I get to the Central Plains,

55
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,559
I will drink a lot with you.

56
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,839
Good,

57
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:13,559
I'll wait in the Central Plains.

58
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,320
Sorry

59
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,199
for the wait.

60
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,160
I just got here.

61
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,160
I can't hold a feast for you.

62
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,520
I can only bring a pot of wine

63
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,440
for you.

64
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:26,360
What a coincidence.

65
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,720
Back in Xiyan Town,

66
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,360
I could only offer you water
in Xiyan Town.

67
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:32,000
I've been very sorry about that.

68
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:33,919
Today, I brought

69
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:34,880
home-brewed wine.

70
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,559
Try it.

71
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,639
Congratulations

72
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,759
to you and me.

73
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:44,440
We really met on Chenrong Mountain.

74
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,919
I have never admired

75
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,279
anyone in my life,

76
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,520
except you.

77
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,080
I was forced by the situation

78
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,960
and had to make a bolder move.

79
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:55,479
Actually,

80
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,639
I also only have one choice.

81
00:02:56,839 --> 00:02:58,759
Because only you have a big heart

82
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,199
to accommodate Dahuang.

83
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:04,440
I am so lucky

84
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,440
to have a confidant like you.

85
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,520
I only have a promise.

86
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:12,600
From now on,

87
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,399
I am willing to share weal and woe

88
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,919
with you.

89
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,960
I'm willing to follow Your Highness

90
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:23,559
and never regret.

91
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,600
From now on,

92
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,160
you and I

93
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:32,919
will fight side by side.

94
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,479
You've been
in Central Plains for a while,

95
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,600
but you rarely come out.

96
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,800
My brother and I were worried
that you wouldn't come.

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,119
Your Highness.

98
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,119
Don't be so formal.

99
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,559
There are many fun places in Zhiyi.

100
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:55,360
If you have any place you want to go,

101
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,800
let my brother accompany you.

102
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:01,000
Xiaoyao,

103
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,119
someone has been thinking about you.

104
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:04,399
Bei,

105
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,759
look who's here.

106
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,960
How come you're here?

107
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,559
I haven't seen Fangfeng Bei
for a long time.

108
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,080
And I want to ask him about something.

109
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,880
Fangfeng Bei,

110
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,320
come with me.

111
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,959
Fenglong,

112
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,839
are you stupid?

113
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,279
Someone else

114
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,679
will have Xiaoyao if you don't act.

115
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:25,959
What are you talking about?

116
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:26,720
Nonsense.

117
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,079
(Chenrong Mansion)

118
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:28,880
Xiaoyao.

119
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,160
Xiaoyao.

120
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:35,040
I've prepared a gift for you.

121
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,559
Bring it in.

122
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:42,959
I remember it's her favorite.

123
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,480
Xiaoyao,

124
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,760
eat a lot and let me know

125
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,079
if it's not enough.

126
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:47,200
Okay.

127
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:48,239
Come in.

128
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,600
Fenglong,

129
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,760
are you stupid?

130
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,799
That's the Great Princess of Haoling.

131
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,760
I can't believe you gave her

132
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,359
two baskets of melons
for her first gift!

133
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,600
Didn't I give her what she liked?

134
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,720
I remember

135
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,600
it's her favorite.

136
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,399
The gift you give your crush

137
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,880
should not only suit their interests

138
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,480
but also match their status.

139
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,519
I see.

140
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:09,760
So it has to be something she likes,

141
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,720
and it has to be valuable.

142
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,119
It should match her status

143
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:14,239
and show my sincerity.

144
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,720
You're quite teachable.

145
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,079
You lost.

146
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:30,640
Drink up.

147
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,959
I have a new game.

148
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:38,760
Want to play?

149
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,320
Let's play. Who's afraid?

150
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,880
I'll show you. Watch it.

151
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:47,359
Fenglong,

152
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,959
what are you doing?

153
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,600
Didn't you say
you brought a gift for Xiaoyao?

154
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,799
Why are you drinking now?

155
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:53,959
I have given the gift.

156
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,239
She loves it very much.

157
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,600
Fenglong gave me a few jars

158
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,040
of wine brewed by the Monkey King.

159
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,279
The taste is indeed extraordinary.

160
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,640
Not just wine,

161
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,600
but also the dice made
from a dragon ball.

162
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,119
Excuse us for a moment.

163
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:06,920
What? Where are we going?

164
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,640
We'll continue when I get back.

165
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,679
Xinyue,

166
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,760
I gave Xiaoyao gifts

167
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,640
as you suggested,

168
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,640
and she really likes them.

169
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:15,480
Xinyue,

170
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,480
for the first time

171
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,119
in my life,

172
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:18,760
I've ever met a girl
so compatible with me.

173
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,519
Many other girls are spoiled

174
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,200
and afraid of many things.

175
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,760
Xiaoyao is straightforward

176
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,359
and will do anything.

177
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:28,000
Playing dice

178
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,799
and drinking games

179
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:31,040
with her is a blast.

180
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,000
You've turned your crush

181
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,959
into a buddy.

182
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:36,480
No wonder it's really fun.

183
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,320
Thank you for your hospitality.

184
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,320
Xiaoyao.

185
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:57,799
Come on.

186
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:58,679
I toast you.

187
00:06:59,079 --> 00:06:59,600
Okay.

188
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,160
Xiaoyao, pace yourself.

189
00:07:04,359 --> 00:07:05,160
Don't worry.

190
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,079
My tolerance can make
all three of you fall.

191
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:09,760
Okay.

192
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,160
Well, let's see
how you make us three fall.

193
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,600
Xiaoyao is not your buddy.

194
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,839
Though we are not buddies,

195
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:17,920
we are more than them.

196
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,000
Come on.

197
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:19,799
Xiaoyao.

198
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:21,760
Come on.

199
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,559
Good.

200
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:35,559
You're flattering me.

201
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:37,839
You wouldn't say that
if you'd heard Jing play.

202
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,920
Right. I haven't heard him play.

203
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:41,559
He hasn't played the guqin for so long.

204
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:42,640
Or may I?

205
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,320
Playing the guqin isn't my forte,

206
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,399
but I have other skills.

207
00:08:21,856 --> 00:08:22,970
(Chenrong Mansion)

208
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,359
Do you think

209
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,559
Xiaoyao

210
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,079
likes me?

211
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:29,119
You want the truth?

212
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:29,679
Of course.

213
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,600
She doesn't.

214
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,440
Is it really because my method is wrong?

215
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,280
I was just trying
to seize the opportunity

216
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,119
to put on a good show
in front of Xiaoyao.

217
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,919
But nothing seemed to please her.

218
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,960
What should I do

219
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,359
to make her like me?

220
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,799
I always keep Xiaoyao
at a polite distance

221
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,159
because I don't want

222
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:49,320
to annoy her.

223
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:50,640
Is this way of pursuing a girl

224
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,919
too passive?

225
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:53,039
Or should I be

226
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,840
more active
and enthusiastic in the future?

227
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,359
No.

228
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:57,239
Why?

229
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,599
Isn't it said that women
can't resist persistent suitors?

230
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:01,280
You should continue
to treat her with respect.

231
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,960
Makes sense.

232
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,320
This way, I can show
my manners and charm,

233
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:08,960
completely different from Fangfeng Bei's

234
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,760
playboy behavior.

235
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:13,679
I'm not late, right?

236
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,880
No.

237
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:16,559
I arrived early.

238
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,239
You look troubled.

239
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,159
Is it about recruiting the army?

240
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,479
Didn't I tell you

241
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:23,000
to leave the rest to me?

242
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,840
I came here to tell you

243
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,200
that I'm going to Chishui

244
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:28,440
to bring you the best warriors.

245
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,960
You're leaving?

246
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:30,960
Well.

247
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,919
What's wrong?

248
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,280
Wait until the new year.

249
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,840
Why is that?

250
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,400
What about Xiaoyao?

251
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,640
What about her?

252
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,719
Xinyue will take care of her.

253
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,960
Just do me a favor.

254
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,479
Keep Xiaoyao company these days.

255
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,359
Okay.

256
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,359
I'll go back to Chishui
after the festival.

257
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,208
(Chenrong Mansion)

258
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,359
I want to tell you something.

259
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,840
Go ahead.

260
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:58,080
I've decided

261
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,119
whatever her attitude,

262
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:03,080
I will go back to Xiaoyao's side

263
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:04,159
and stay with her forever.

264
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,799
You want to stay with Xiaoyao.

265
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,400
Is Xiaoyao in danger again?

266
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,280
I'm sorry, Fenglong.

267
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,760
I adore Xiaoyao

268
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,919
and want to be with her.

269
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,119
I know you want to marry her,

270
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,799
but I can't lose her.

271
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,359
You know I want to marry her,

272
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,559
yet you still dare to covet her.

273
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,520
You even lured my future fiancée
in my house!

274
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:26,840
Fenglong,

275
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,520
Tushan Jing.

276
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,440
I see you as my brother,

277
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,280
but what about you?

278
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,080
Fenglong, calm down.

279
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,440
I just want to kill him right now.

280
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,200
Tushan Jing,

281
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,119
get out of here.

282
00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:34,280
Take your darn money and leave.

283
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:34,840
Guards.

284
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,840
Don't think

285
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,760
we need your money.

286
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,559
- Drag him away!
- Tushan Jing.

287
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,119
Tushan Jing.

288
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,159
Tushan Jing.

289
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,440
Fenglong.

290
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,248
(Chenrong Mansion)

291
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:02,200
Tushan Jing,
you still have the guts to come.

292
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,000
You can give me three punches.

293
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:06,520
If you continue,

294
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,479
I won't be polite.

295
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:08,559
Not polite?

296
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,159
When have you been polite?

297
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:17,159
- Fenglong.
- Tushan Jing!

298
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,400
Tushan Jing.

299
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,159
I'll beat you up

300
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:20,359
for hiding it from me.

301
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,599
Don't worry.

302
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:22,599
No one will die.

303
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,760
You've gone too far!

304
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,520
I remember when we were young,

305
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,760
you were polite,

306
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,960
and always neatly dressed.

307
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,280
Unlike me,

308
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,039
messy like a monkey.

309
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,400
But once I insulted Hou
and you heard it,

310
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,880
you picked up the guqin and hit me.

311
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:44,880
We two had a big fight in the mud.

312
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,679
I could fight better than you,

313
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,440
but you fought desperately,

314
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,520
which forced me to swear

315
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,280
never to insult Hou again.

316
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,719
You still remember it so clearly.

317
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,919
Since then,

318
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:01,679
I've started to envy Hou.

319
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:04,359
If only I had a brother

320
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:05,280
who would fight for me.

321
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,679
One day Auntie suddenly told me

322
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:11,080
to get along with you like siblings.

323
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,520
I suddenly realized

324
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,799
we are cousins after all.

325
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,719
As long as I'm willing,

326
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,520
we can be good brothers.

327
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:19,599
All these years,

328
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,919
I can tell you all my ambitions

329
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,320
and selfish desires

330
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,760
and you never think I'm daydreaming.

331
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:29,320
No matter what I'm pondering,

332
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,080
you can understand

333
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,359
and will help me.

334
00:12:33,359 --> 00:12:35,320
Actually, I'm not angry
that you stole Xiaoyao.

335
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,039
I'm angry that
you don't treat me as your brother.

336
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,880
Why didn't you tell me?

337
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,559
I had fallen for Xiaoyao

338
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:44,840
before she became Xiaoyao.

339
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,400
You would definitely blame me
for not telling you earlier,

340
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:49,400
but I really had no way to tell you.

341
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,359
Many times,

342
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,520
I feel conflicted.

343
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,520
I think I'm not good enough,

344
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,359
but I really can't give up.

345
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:00,359
What do you mean
you don't deserve Xiaoyao?

346
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:01,919
Tushan Jing,

347
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,799
when did you become
so timid and useless?

348
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,960
Did the torture of Tushan Hou

349
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,559
even soften your bones?

350
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,440
Listen to me.

351
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,159
My brothers are the best.

352
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:14,760
Let alone one Xiaoyao,

353
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:16,640
you deserve even ten Xiaoyao.

354
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,400
You just said

355
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,280
you fell in love with Xiaoyao

356
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:25,440
before she became Xiaoyao.

357
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,960
What does it mean?

358
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,359
Actually, I knew her a long time ago

359
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,840
when she wandered about

360
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,359
the mortal world.

361
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:39,159
So you've been fooling us all along.

362
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,119
Do you think I wanted to?

363
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:42,080
What do you think

364
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,479
I felt watching you

365
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:44,559
trying various ways

366
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,760
to please Xiaoyao?

367
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,559
You deserved it.

368
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,239
Are we cool?

369
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:48,880
Not yet.

370
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:52,559
Have more fights?

371
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:54,760
If they spread the news
that I've beaten you

372
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,599
like this,

373
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,960
no one will believe it.

374
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,359
As long as you can calm down,

375
00:14:04,599 --> 00:14:05,479
you can continue.

376
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:06,840
After all, I can't beat you down.

377
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:14,000
His Majesty is in a meeting.

378
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,880
Please wait here.

379
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,559
I wonder how Cang Xuan

380
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:18,840
and Xiaoyao are doing.

381
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,799
We haven't figured out

382
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:21,840
who sent the assassins.

383
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,559
The major suspect is Cang Xuan.

384
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,640
The tattoos

385
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,599
with Ruomu syrup

386
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:27,880
on them date back decades.

387
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:30,039
It's solid evidence.

388
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:31,479
Everyone knows

389
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:33,520
his tie with the Ruoshui Clan.

390
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,119
Having a tattoo with Ruomu syrup

391
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:35,960
is like having

392
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,359
"Cang Xuan" tattooed

393
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:40,239
on the assassins' chests.

394
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:42,440
The person
who framed Cang Xuan is clever.

395
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:43,719
He knows

396
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,159
as long as the king suspects someone

397
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:47,359
and wants to kill him,

398
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:49,400
the tattoo is just a trigger.

399
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,359
Fifth King,

400
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,599
you must have worked hard

401
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,799
in secret.

402
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:53,719
Haoling Jiuyao.

403
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:55,200
Who are you to talk nonsense

404
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,719
and intervene in the regime

405
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:57,599
of the Xiyan Kingdom?

406
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,799
When my mother led the troops to war,

407
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:00,760
where were you?

408
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:02,280
If you had stepped out

409
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,760
to stop my mother

410
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,559
from intervening in the regime,

411
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,640
I wouldn't have grown up

412
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,719
without a mother.

413
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,000
You...

414
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,760
Cang Xuan.

415
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,359
I believe

416
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,039
you didn't organize this assassination.

417
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:15,400
Go back.

418
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

419
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:18,679
I shall take my leave.

420
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,359
Xiaoyao usually looks

421
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:24,559
easygoing.

422
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,559
But she's really sharp.

423
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,239
It was such a tricky question

424
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,200
that Deyan began to stagger.

425
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,719
You...

426
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,559
You...

427
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,359
She's so articulate.

428
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:36,359
If someone marries her,

429
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,200
he has to lay low

430
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,799
to avoid any fights.

431
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:45,760
I toast you

432
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:48,159
with water as wine.

433
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:50,239
Thank you for coming to my rescue.

434
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:51,440
Thankfully, you're safe.

435
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:52,440
See you around.

436
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,640
Jing.

437
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:04,799
May I talk to you?

438
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,080
Xiaoyao...

439
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,440
Xiaoyao...

440
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,960
I think...

441
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,320
If you truly like her,

442
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,679
I have no right to object.

443
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,559
Jing,

444
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,359
I feel sorry

445
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,479
that I like Xiaoyao.

446
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:24,000
If you hadn't been married
and got a kid,

447
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,239
I wouldn't have done this.

448
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:26,479
I understand.

449
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:29,280
Xiaoyao is a good girl.

450
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,559
I also hope

451
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:32,719
she can find someone

452
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:35,239
who loves her and deserves her.

453
00:16:36,698 --> 00:16:38,208
(Chenrong Mansion)

454
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:41,080
Sit.

455
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,400
Xiaoyao,

456
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,760
let's get married.

457
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,559
I've wanted to marry you.

458
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,840
I think you know it.

459
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,799
I thought

460
00:16:53,599 --> 00:16:55,080
you had long regarded me as a friend.

461
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:57,159
I feel relaxed with you,

462
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,960
so I think marrying you is a good idea.

463
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,039
Tell me

464
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,440
the real reason you want to marry me.

465
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:04,479
Cang Xuan

466
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,880
has reached a critical point
of life and death.

467
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,000
The Chishui Family is top
of Four Great Clans.

468
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,920
It can influence the position
and decision of other clans.

469
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,079
I want to help Cang Xuan.

470
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,040
But I must become the clan leader

471
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,400
to mobilize the Chishui Family.

472
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,640
Grandfather and other elders want me

473
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:20,199
to experience more.

474
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,959
But I can't wait any longer.

475
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,800
I want to be the clan leader
immediately.

476
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,599
Marrying you is the fastest way.

477
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:26,760
You want to marry me

478
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,560
because I'm Princess of Haoling, right?

479
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,439
Not exactly.

480
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,439
I really

481
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:31,839
like your straightforwardness.

482
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,160
In that case,

483
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,439
I won't be coy either.

484
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,719
Did Cang Xuan tell you

485
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:38,079
about the conditions for marrying me?

486
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,760
He said if I want to marry you,

487
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,520
I should have no other women.

488
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,199
Xiaoyao,

489
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:44,920
you know

490
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,000
what kind of person I am.

491
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:46,920
I swear.

492
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:49,160
As long as you marry me,

493
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:51,760
I'll only have you
as my woman in this life.

494
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,199
♪Love often brings difficulties♪

495
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,560
You didn't reject me outright,

496
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:57,920
which means I have a chance.

497
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,760
Others propose marriage
with romantic feelings.

498
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:02,760
But we two

499
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,800
are like doing a business.

500
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,280
That's why we're a good match.

501
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,119
To be honest,

502
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,520
I've always resisted getting married.

503
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:12,520
But if I marry you,

504
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,640
I feel that no matter what happens,

505
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,319
we can sit down

506
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,119
and discuss it calmly.

507
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:20,199
I think it's not bad to have a wife.

508
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:23,280
It's too sudden.

509
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,160
After all, it's about my marriage.

510
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:26,920
Let me think about it.

511
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,079
Okay.

512
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,359
I'll wait for your news.

513
00:18:35,104 --> 00:18:35,760
(Chenrong Mansion)

514
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,959
When Deyan
and Cang Xuan argued on the court.

515
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,839
Deyan said he would

516
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:41,079
rely on the old clans of Xiyan

517
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,319
but divide our Central Plains clans.

518
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:45,400
But Cang Xuan said
he would treat our clans

519
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,359
and the old clans of Xiyan equally.

520
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:50,199
The Four Great Clans
have never been involved in disputes,

521
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:52,760
but now the crisis
we are facing is comparable

522
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,439
to the one
that Xiyan soldiers opened our gates.

523
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:58,359
If Deyan ascends the throne,

524
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,199
based on his strategic governance,

525
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,640
I'm afraid our clans

526
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,560
will live in suspicion

527
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,599
and never be in peace.

528
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,520
Between Cang Xuan and Deyan,

529
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,439
which side should we support?

530
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,079
Isn't it obvious?

531
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,359
The Chishui Family is willing to support

532
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,160
Prince Cang Xuan

533
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,520
for the Central Plains

534
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,560
and for my own bright future.

535
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,719
The Tushan Family
will support Prince Cang Xuan.

536
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:25,599
I will stand with Chief Chishui,

537
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:27,760
supporting Prince Cang Xuan.

538
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,920
- We will support Prince Cang Xuan.
- We will support Prince Cang Xuan.
