00:00:05,056 --> 00:00:07,296
(Lost You Forever S1 Special Edition 3)

3
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,799
I stepped on your sesame seed cake.

4
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:53,840
What compensation do you want?

5
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:11,360
Whip wounds,

6
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,040
burn wounds,

7
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,199
knife wounds,

8
00:01:14,639 --> 00:01:15,400
and stab wounds.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,040
There are both new and older ones,

10
00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:20,680
and all seem unusual.

11
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,080
It's the result of enduring

12
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,319
long-term torture.

13
00:01:23,839 --> 00:01:25,599
Killing a man requires
only cutting off his head.

14
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,440
Behind such torment

15
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,800
must be

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,160
an extraordinary reason.

17
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:33,879
The injury on your leg
must be treated quickly.

18
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:35,400
I am a physician.

19
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,319
I'm going to break
your misaligned bone now.

20
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,760
It will be struck three times.

21
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:42,040
If you really can't bear it,

22
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,480
just scream.

23
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:46,800
He's quite tough.

24
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,919
He didn't even make a sound.

25
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,480
Compared to the torture
he's suffered before,

26
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,000
this is nothing.

27
00:01:53,024 --> 00:01:53,568
Come on.

28
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:32,399
(After enduring such torture,)

29
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,479
(I thought his character
would change a lot,)

30
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,360
(but he still retains
a sense of kindness.)

31
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
(That's rare.)

32
00:03:22,144 --> 00:03:22,759
Come.

33
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,479
I'll undo it.

34
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,144
Why?

35
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,119
Not happy with me helping you undo it?

36
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,360
I've been looking after you,

37
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:32,479
cleaning your body,
applying medicine and washing your hair.

38
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:33,600
There's nothing I haven't seen.

39
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:34,960
Besides,

40
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,520
we're both men.

41
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:37,440
What are you hiding?

42
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,880
I'm not going to hold you responsible.

43
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,759
I...

44
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,839
I... I have something else to do.

45
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,959
You bathe by yourself.

46
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:18,920
Do it yourself.

47
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:23,959
She's a woman.

What's your name?

61
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,200
You...

62
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,160
saved me.

63
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,279
I am

64
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,880
your servant now.

65
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,359
Please name me.

66
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,079
I don't want you.

67
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,192
I...

68
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,119
listen to you.

69
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,040
Listen to me?

70
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,079
If you meet someone
who knows you in the future,

71
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:57,959
will you listen to me?

72
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,064
Yes.

73
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,544
Alright.

74
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,600
Stay here.

75
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,000
Beggar,

76
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,399
from today on, your name is Ye Shiqi.

77
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,640
Shiqi.

78
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,760
Why did you follow me?

79
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:24,519
Go back now.

80
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,399
Do you have to follow?

81
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,000
You're so virtuous and capable.

82
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,079
It's lucky for the girl

83
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,279
to marry you in the future.

84
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,320
Someone like you

85
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,079
tries not to enter the mountain.

86
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,119
Someone like me can't enter.

87
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:24,040
Someone like you shouldn't enter either.

88
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,320
I'll wait for you here.

89
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,359
Okay.

90
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,119
I am Ye Shiqi.

91
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:38,359
I'm looking for Wen Xiaoliu.

92
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,600
Your Lordship.

93
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,679
He is my servant.

94
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:48,519
He's here for me.

95
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:49,559
Please don't hurt him.

96
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,040
Shiqi.

97
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,679
Don't move!

98
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:07,920
Do what I say.

99
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,048
Nothing.

100
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:19,119
Just small injuries.

101
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,440
Don't set your sights on him.

102
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,799
He is mine now.

103
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,200
Let's go home.

104
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,359
I waited for you.

105
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,760
You didn't come back.

106
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,080
I went to find you.

107
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,239
What if you can't find me?

108
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,960
I'll keep looking.

109
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,080
What if you never find me?

110
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,640
Keep looking

111
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,159
until I find you.

112
00:08:58,239 --> 00:08:59,840
I know you're Ye Shiqi.

113
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,760
I hope you will always be.

114
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,159
But that's impossible.

115
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:08,880
But as long as you don't leave me,

116
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,799
you'll be Ye Shiqi.

117
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:12,359
You have to listen to me.

118
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:17,679
You must only listen to me.

119
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:34,719
This is...

120
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,239
Pimply is getting married.

121
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:42,119
That's great.

122
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,880
That's great.

123
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,479
My injury is almost healed.

124
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,119
Let's pack up and go back.

125
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,080
Mu and the others
are still waiting for us.

126
00:09:55,616 --> 00:09:56,128
Let's go.

127
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:07,880
Let me do it.

128
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:12,799
Okay.

129
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,559
Be careful.

130
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,919
I mean you must be careful.

131
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:24,880
We can make it again

132
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,960
if the medicine's spoiled.

133
00:10:37,248 --> 00:10:37,792
Drink it.

134
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,520
Are you a fool?

135
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,119
It's poison.

136
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,640
You gave me this.

137
00:10:54,144 --> 00:10:54,679
Hurry.

138
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,000
Eat this.

139
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,200
You're really an idiot.

140
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,840
For me?

141
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:16,960
Thank you.

142
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:34,960
You picked this for watching?

143
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,880
It's delicious.

144
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,719
I thought it's for eating.

145
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,119
Here you go.

146
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,440
Tastes good.

147
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:52,599
Take this. I'll help you.

148
00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:55,479
In the mountains,

149
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,200
I ate anything when I was hungry.

150
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,640
So, I discovered
a lot of delicious flowers.

151
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:03,799
Tell me which flowers are eatable.

152
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
I'll pick them for you.

153
00:12:08,768 --> 00:12:09,280
Okay.

154
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,799
Mu,

155
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,239
Pimply and Skinny.

156
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,760
They all think I'm a good person.

157
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,479
But actually, when I was young,

158
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,119
I killed many people.

159
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:23,919
I haven't done it for a long time.

160
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:28,919
I really wanted to kill them.

161
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:29,880
Will you help me?

162
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,119
Forgive me.

163
00:12:37,359 --> 00:12:37,919
Shiqi.

164
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,840
Do you know them?

165
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,640
That woman is a lady
of a grand deity family.

166
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,880
Are you afraid they would recognize you,

167
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:03,719
so you hid?

168
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,080
Or do you think

169
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,359
I shouldn't provoke them,

170
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,200
so you hid,

171
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,840
letting them take the antidote?

172
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,440
I was afraid they would recognize me,

173
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,559
but I feared even more
you'd mess with them.

174
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:20,359
Don't follow me.

175
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,559
You're angry with me.

176
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,080
You don't talk to me.

177
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:30,919
I talk to you every day.

178
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,799
I want to hear you talk as before.

179
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,960
I wanted to hear you talk.

180
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:35,719
As before?

181
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,159
What's the difference
between before and now?

182
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,640
Aren't I treating you
the same as Pimply and Skinny?

183
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,159
Xiaoliu,

184
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,159
I'm sorry.

185
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,239
I was wrong.

186
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,239
I was really wrong.

187
00:13:57,239 --> 00:13:59,039
I won't do it again.

188
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,039
Aren't I back now?

189
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,640
My body and I are both yours now.

190
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,679
I promise

191
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,679
I will clean myself up
thoroughly from now on,

192
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,200
and you can come and eat me anytime.

193
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:10,799
Please forgive me this time,

194
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,520
okay?

195
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,840
Just this once.

196
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,440
Why is it you?

197
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,679
Why are you in my room?

198
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,559
I'm sorry.

199
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,440
I let you down.

200
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:36,840
I'm sorry.

201
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,159
I'm sorry for my harsh tone just now.

202
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:40,599
Don't take it to heart.

203
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,119
It's my fault.

204
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:50,520
Skinny.

205
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:51,479
What's up?

206
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:53,400
Has the wisteria at the foot
of the mountain bloomed?

207
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,679
I'm busy working.

208
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:56,400
I don't have the time
to care about flowers.

209
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,000
They have bloomed.

210
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,479
Xiaoliu.

211
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,640
Eat it while it's hot.

212
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:15,280
Wisteria flower egg pancake.

213
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,280
You made this?

214
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,080
Ye Shiqi.

215
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:52,039
You always know
what I'm thinking, don't you?

216
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,200
There won't be a second time.

217
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:00,000
No matter what happens,

218
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,280
I will never let you
be unable to find me

219
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,559
when you need me.

220
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:11,760
Never again.

221
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:13,280
Xiaoliu!

222
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,080
Xiaoliu!

223
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,000
Hurry.

224
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:16,960
Come with me to see.

225
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,840
Hurry.

226
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:27,440
Let's go together.

227
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,080
Your choice.

228
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:49,080
What kind of woman do you like?

229
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,840
Is it the innocent type
like a little white rabbit,

230
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:55,039
or the passionate type
like the one inside?

231
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,479
Why are you blushing?

232
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:03,599
Do you also want to get married?

233
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,160
Sang Tian'er is not young,

234
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,680
and she's not the top woman.

235
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,719
Normally, the bawd would not
hold her back and not allow us

236
00:17:24,719 --> 00:17:25,959
to redeem her.

237
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:29,319
Someone's playing dirty.

238
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:35,959
Could it be Xiang Liu?

239
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,359
I need to find Xiang Liu.

240
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:39,800
I can't let my actions

241
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,319
ruin Skinny's marriage.

242
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,160
Don't go.

243
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,199
I'll go.

244
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:47,560
Don't bother.

245
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:48,920
Don't provoke him.

246
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,280
Bad Xiang Liu.

247
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,000
Bad Xiang Liu.

248
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:57,600
Xiaoliu!

249
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:00,959
Shiqi.

250
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,199
Shiqi.

251
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,000
Shiqi.

252
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,839
My leg hurts.

253
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Shiqi.

254
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:15,199
I can't walk again.

255
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,359
Shiqi.

256
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,640
I worry a lot

257
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,280
when I can't find you.

258
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,520
Understood.

259
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:30,280
Skinny's marriage

260
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,239
was not stopped by Xiang Liu

261
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,880
but by another one.

262
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,599
It's Xuan from the Winery.

263
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,319
You are really smart.

264
00:18:57,239 --> 00:18:59,880
When it's time to attend the wedding,
remember to invite me.

265
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:03,160
Alright, alright.

266
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:04,160
Thank you.

267
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,119
Shiqi.

268
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:16,280
I'm fine.

269
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:18,119
It's just that I was too happy and lost

270
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:18,760
my balance.

271
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:20,000
Help me up.

272
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:23,920
Mr. Xuan, we will leave you.

273
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,680
Thank you.

274
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,760
Shiqi.

275
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:28,520
Didn't I tell you not to follow me?

276
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,280
I was just exchanging
a few words with Mr. Xuan.

277
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,599
I'm worried about you.

278
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,000
What do I have to worry about?

279
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,640
Sang Tian'er

280
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:37,760
is very brave.

281
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,160
People scorn
trading pretense for sincerity.

282
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,280
It's not worth it
for those who show sincerity.

283
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,400
You, on the other hand, appreciate it.

284
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,160
Even if it's pretense,

285
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,560
she has bet her future,

286
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,359
giving that person a chance to trade
sincerity for sincerity.

287
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:04,560
I almost have more injury.

288
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,239
Thank you.

289
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,880
Give me the crutch.

290
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:28,800
It is slippery.

291
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:49,560
You shouldn't spoil me like this.

292
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:52,160
What if I get used to your care,

293
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,239
but then you leave?

294
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,319
What should I do then?

295
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,920
I won't leave.

296
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,280
People who make promises are countless,

297
00:20:58,719 --> 00:21:01,199
but those who keep them
are hard to find.

298
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,119
Stop!

299
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,760
Master.

300
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,079
They all say you're dead.

301
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,800
It's been ten years.

302
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,760
Heaven has pity on us.

303
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:17,079
I finally found you.

304
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:18,760
Take your time.

305
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:19,800
I'll go now.

306
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,160
Master.

307
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:24,000
I still want to be Ye Shiqi.

308
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,359
There is no Ye Shiqi in this world.

309
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:29,439
What's your name?

310
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:31,520
Next time we meet,

311
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:33,319
it's not good
to pretend not to know you.

312
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:36,239
But even if you lent me
ten times the courage,

313
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,719
I wouldn't dare to call you Shiqi.

314
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,560
Even if you don't mind,

315
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:42,439
your wife would shoot me with an arrow.

316
00:21:43,199 --> 00:21:44,079
Tushan Jing.

317
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:46,439
Six years.

318
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,560
I've taken you in for six years.

319
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,239
You exempt me from six years of rent.

320
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:52,760
From now on,

321
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:54,599
we owe each other nothing.

322
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,239
I need a favor.

323
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:05,888
Okay.

324
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:07,439
I need a batch of herbs.

325
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,119
It's all written here, very clear.

326
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:11,680
Okay.

327
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:14,359
Once the herbs are delivered
to Qingshui Town, notify me.

328
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,640
Xiang Liu will pick it up.

329
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:18,719
Okay.

330
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:23,119
I don't have money to pay you.

331
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:24,520
You know that, right?

332
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,560
You don't need to pay it.

333
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,520
Don't thank me

334
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:34,319
anymore.

335
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,119
I've been used to being alone

336
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:40,479
and bearing everything by myself.

337
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:42,199
Since I dare to do it,

338
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,280
I can face it.

339
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:48,160
You don't have to face it alone.

340
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,000
Thanks for taking care of Xiaoliu.

341
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,760
I'll take Xiaoliu away

342
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,520
when things

343
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,680
settle down.

344
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,599
That depends on

345
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,160
whether he is willing to go with you.

346
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,319
You're no longer

347
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:14,280
the homeless Ye Shiqi.

348
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:16,400
Your home is in Qingqiu Hill.

349
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,719
The Tushan family doesn't need me.

350
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:21,479
But I need...

351
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,839
Play a round?

352
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,079
I heard that you excel at music, chess,

353
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:29,920
calligraphy and painting,

354
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,599
but I never got to play with you.

355
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:35,199
Do I play with him?

356
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:38,920
It's up to you.

357
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:40,479
None of my business.

358
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:43,119
If you say yes, I'll play.

359
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,560
If you say no, I won't.

360
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,760
I want to ask you for something.

361
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,520
Okay.

362
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,439
You can give me anything?

363
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,839
You can take

364
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:55,800
whatever I have.

365
00:23:56,719 --> 00:23:57,599
If I don't have it,

366
00:23:58,239 --> 00:23:59,239
I'll help you find it.

367
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,400
I want two Ice Crystal wind chimes.

368
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,280
Jing Ye.

369
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,800
I've promised I'll do what you say.

370
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,920
Whatever you want me to do,

371
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,479
I'll do my best.

372
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:18,560
You're leaving?

373
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,119
This is Qingshui Town.

374
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,239
Not Qingqiu.

375
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:22,760
Why haven't you left yet?

376
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:23,920
I won't leave

377
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,760
as long as you're here.

378
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:27,520
I wish I was just Ye Shiqi.

379
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,640
I know you hate Tushan Jing.

380
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:32,839
I tried to restrain myself
from coming to see you,

381
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,920
but I can't.

382
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:37,199
I dare not leave.

383
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:39,920
I'm afraid if I turn around,

384
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,400
I can't find you anymore
when I look back.

385
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:50,280
Tushan Family must have
secret passages going in

386
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,439
and out of Qingshui Town.

387
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,920
Help me escape.

388
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,016
Okay.

389
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,079
You offended Haoling and Xiyan for me.

390
00:24:57,479 --> 00:24:59,119
You will regret it in the future.

391
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,520
No regrets.

392
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,199
As long as I can stay with you.

393
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,119
If you can't return to Qingqiu Hill,

394
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,880
there will be no
Master Qingqiu in this world.

395
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:15,719
It is just a joke originally.

396
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,880
What Master Qingqiu?

397
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:27,920
After taking off your noble clothes

398
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:30,199
and losing your noble status,

399
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,520
you are nothing at all.

♪You are the warm sun♪

401

I won't leave you.

403
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,719
Do you still want to be
with me for the rest of your life?

404
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,479
Right.

405
00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:49,599
I took a bath in the tub.

406

♪You are the flowers♪

407
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,920
I saw it.

00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,760
Your face turned red

409
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,560
when you watched my body.

410
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:03,680
From that day on, I decided

411
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,119
I would never leave you.

412
00:26:06,784 --> 00:26:09,984

I don't want to be Tushan Jing.

415

And I don't want to seek revenge.

416
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,719
But...

417
00:26:17,199 --> 00:26:18,560
I will cancel the engagement.

418
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,439
I promise.

419
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:21,560
Give me 20 years.

420
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:24,119
No, 15 years.

421
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:26,400
Give Tushan Jing 15 years.

422
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,719
In 15 years,

423
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:29,479

You don't fall in love

427

428
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,520
