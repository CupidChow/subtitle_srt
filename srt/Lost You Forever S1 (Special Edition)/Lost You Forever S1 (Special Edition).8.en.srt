(Lost You Forever S1 Special Edition 8)

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,960
King of Haoling has sent out invitations

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,880
to all the clans in Dahuang,

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,159
inviting them

6
00:00:16,159 --> 00:00:20,959
to attend the return celebration
of Great Princess of Haoling.

7
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:25,799
This shows the deep love
King of Haoling has for Great Princess.

8
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:27,799
(I am just an abandoned person.)

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,120
(I couldn't protect myself,)

10
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:30,319
(had no one to rely on,)

11
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:32,119
(and nowhere to go.)

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,919
You can't protect yourself,

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,360
had no one to rely on,

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,599
and had nowhere to go.

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,959
All lies.

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,080
Is it very painful?

17
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:51,599
If it weren't for her,

18
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,000
you would still be
the only princess of Haoling,

19
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,400
the only daughter of your father.

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,000
But that woman suddenly
came out of nowhere

21
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,720
and took away your everything.

22
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:03,799
Your Highness,

23
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,959
don't you want to get revenge?

24
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,680
Why don't we torture her a bit

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,680
but not take her life?

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,480
How is it?

27
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,239
You are a kind girl indeed.

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,879
But,

29
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:32,559
how can we give her a good lesson?

30
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:39,120
You're not thinking about
pushing me down, are you?

31
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:40,400
You are right.

32
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:56,879
(You want to die?)

33
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,839
When we were underwater,

34
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:08,440
why didn't you let me help you
even at the risk of dying?

35
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,119
Because I was scared.

36
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,000
Scared?

37
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,399
Scared of what?

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,720
You...

39
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,759

to shoot that pine tree in front?

People

120
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:06,160

00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,760
Flowers for the beauty.

123
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,839

to kill us that night,)

nor I would have escaped.)

00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,959
I will be happy to learn.

132
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,239

133
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:33,480
(I'll see what you are really up to.)

134
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,200
Just use it as a target.

135

139
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,920

Take what you can get.

142
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,880
If you were a master,

143
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,640
your disciples would like you.

00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,359

00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:08,399
An underground casino.

148
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,359
Put on the mask.

149
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,440
Nobody will recognize you

150
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,440

151
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,399
enjoy yourself.

152
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,959
Do I have to wear it?

153
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:18,720
As you wish.

160
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:33,280
Stop it.

161
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:47,159

Once the heart dies,

165
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,039
he will feel hopeless.

166
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,919
Why don't we make a bet?

167
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,239
On what?

168
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,159
Bet on who can arouse his hope.

169
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,599
What? Can't you?

170
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,599
Interesting.

171
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:09,640
Don't be afraid.

172
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,479
You have to believe life is worth living
for something beautiful

173
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:14,840
in this world.

174
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,799
Stop laughing. It's your turn.

175
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,960
What did you say to him?

176
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,719
If you hug me,

177
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,080
I will tell you.

178
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,320
Forget it.

179
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,159
Alright.

180
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:38,760
Let me tell you.

181
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,080
I'm not interested.

182
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,640
Are you sure?

183
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,200
Yes.

184
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,719
But I want to tell you.

185
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:45,039
I beg you.

186
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,359
Okay, how are you going to beg me?

187
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:49,679
I'll hug you.

188
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,880
I'm willing to throw myself at you.

189

Fangfeng Bei.

190
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:54,559
Are you going to say?

191
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,599
If not,

192
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:56,280
I'm really leaving.

193
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,880
Fine, I'll tell you.

194
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,559
I told that slave

195
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:01,799
I was once a slave in the arena,

196
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,919
but I survived.

197
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,640
Although he is locked in a cage,

198
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,880
he is very clever.

199
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,840
He won't easily believe what you said.

200
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,400
You must have done something else.

201
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,760
Because I talked to him
with a special language

202
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,559
of the demon slaves in the arena.

203
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,320
It's said even the slave owners
can't understand it.

204
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,239
How do you know it?

205
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:20,799
Maybe I was really a slave in the arena.

206
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,239
Who are you?

207
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:24,280

Yes.

211

Who are you exactly?

216
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,119
Who do you think I could be,

217
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,880

218
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,760
If I find out you lied to me,

219
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,159
I will shoot an arrow into your heart.

You seem in a bad mood.

00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,919
Why not skip practice today?

225
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,479
I will have many excuses

226
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,840
to skip it.

227
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,280
Why not give up now?

228
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:38,799
You really don't act like a princess.

229
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,599
You know it. I'm a wild princess.

230
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:42,880
Why not quit being a princess

231
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,280
and wander around with me?

232
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,159
If you give up everything,

233
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,200
I'll go with you.

00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,799
Don't try to fool me.

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,719
Don't think you're more bold than me.

236
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:15,599
To catch an assassin
by the Fifth and Seventh Kings' order.

237
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:16,320
Search.

238
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,239
I suggest you leave as soon as possible.

239
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,159
There's still time
to choose someone else.

240
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:30,080
(My poison has no effect on him.)

241
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:31,479
You have strong spirit power,

242
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:32,960
but from your breath,

243
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,119
you seem to be seriously injured.

244
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:36,840
I still suggest you choose someone else.

245
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,679
You

246
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,599
are...

247
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:51,200
You have so many fair-weather friends.

248
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:52,880
Why would you come to me?

249
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,799
As you said,
they are fair-weather friends.

250
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,320
Go up.

251
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,239
My brother can't
keep things under control now.

252
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,039
My status might not help.

253
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,559
If they really start a thorough search,

254
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:19,280
I can't do anything.

255
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,039
Your Highness.

256
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,080
Princes Yueliang and Shiran
brought soldiers to catch an assassin.

257
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,919
Could you please help appease her?

258
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:34,239
I didn't mean to offend her.

259
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:34,919
What?

260
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:38,239
Are you also thinking of conducting
a thorough search of my room?

261
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,880
I dare not.

262
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,520
The medicine should have
taken effect by now.

263
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:46,400
Let me check.

264
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:54,400
Who are you exactly?

265
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:56,119
Such a good healing medicine

266
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,200
has no effect on you at all.

267
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,559
Who do you want me to be?

268
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,080
Whoever you are.

269
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,000
I need to heal.

270
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,760
Not here.

271
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:19,280
Bite here.

272
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,200
Why not the neck?

273
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,760
I used to be a man.

274
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,280
Can it be the same now?

275
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:25,840
Whatever.

276
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:27,840
Now I'm healing your wounds.

277
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,359
Xiaoyao.

278
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,239
I'm fine.

279
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,960
You should eat more.

This way your wounds can heal faster.

281
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,320
I'll be fine after I have

282
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,400
some tonic food.

00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,559
So, are you no longer angry?

287
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:44,280
Can you continue

288
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,400

289
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,080
I have to leave for a while.

290
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:48,000
I'll teach you then.

Standing in the way

323
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:21,359
would be sending her to die.

00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,280

Thankfully, you let so many people

329
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,920
keep giving her spirit power

330
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,439

332
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,079

Maybe decades.

334

Don't make me look down on you.

345

If you dare to die,

347
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,239
I will chop you up

348
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,000

Don't be afraid.

352
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:01,199
When I escaped from the fighting arena,

353
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,119
and almost died in the whirlpool.

354
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:04,160
What happened later?

355
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,479
Later, I fled to the Far North

356
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,719
and hid for over 100 years.

357
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,040
People always think I wear white

358
00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:12,880

Actually,

360
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,479
it's just a habit of trying to survive.

361
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:19,640
In the icy and snowy Far North,

362
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:22,599
white is the easiest color to hide in.

00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:56,800
I agree to your terms.

378
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,479
Princess, would you like to go with me

379
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:02,839
to find some real joy?

380
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:03,839
Why not?

381
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,520
Isn't that

382
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,719
the young man we saw in Xiyan Town

383
00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:08,479
four decades ago?

384
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,280
He made a deal with the slave master.

385
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,640
If he wins consecutively for 40 years,

386
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,040
the slave master will set him free.

387
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,520
Tonight is the last night.

388
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:25,839
You've been waiting for 40 years.

389
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:27,239
You'll be free

390
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:28,599
only by winning this time.

391
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:29,800
Stand up now!

392
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,319
Stand up! Stand up!

393
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,400
Stand up!

394
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,119
He won. He's free.

395
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:52,359
He won. You won!

396
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,560
Yes.

397
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,560
He won. He's free.

398
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,839
I'm glad you won.

399
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:02,760
Here is the money I won
by betting on you.

400
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,760
Take this money and go see the ocean.

401
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,479
He has gone.

402
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:11,640
Why are you still dazed?

403
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,239
Let's go.

404
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:14,560
When you escaped from the death arena,

405
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,599
if it was I who saved you,

406
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,680
it would be great.

407
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,319
If I saved you,

408
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:20,280
I would only let you be Fangfeng Bei,

409
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:22,359
a free Fangfeng Bei,

410
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:24,800
owing no one a favor

411
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:27,160

You're not that capable.

417
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,599
I am not saying
Lord Hong Jiang is not good,

418
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:53,280
I just think you were born
to be as free as a bird.

419
