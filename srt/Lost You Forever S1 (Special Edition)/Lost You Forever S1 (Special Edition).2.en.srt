(Lost You Forever S1 Special Edition 2)

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,640
Let me tell you a story
from my childhood.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,840
I was quite young.

5
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:14,119
My parents left to fight in the war.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,279
One day,

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,840
my mother and auntie suddenly came back

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,440
with the news
that my father died in the war.

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,840
I saw my grandmother,

10
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:23,799
my auntie,

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,559
and my mother

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,520
hugging each other and crying.

13
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:29,440
I'll protect you.

14
00:00:29,536 --> 00:00:30,048
Mother.

15
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,120
Don't be scared.

16
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,200
My good child.

17
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,599
The three of them

18
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:35,520
were the toughest women I'd known.

19
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:37,520
But at that moment,

20
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,880
they cried their hearts out

21
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,560
like they lost all hope in life

22
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:44,240
and didn't know what lay ahead.

23
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,000
At that moment,

24
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,560
I swore to myself

25
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:49,759
that I have to protect them.

26
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,080
I promised my granny and auntie

27
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,360
to protect Zhaoyun Peak and Xiaoyao.

28
00:00:54,599 --> 00:00:55,639
Alright, you're my sister.

29
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,279
And I'm your brother forever.

30
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,400
No matter what happens,

31
00:00:58,479 --> 00:00:59,759
we'll be together forever.

32
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,159
I want to protect my family.

33
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,040
That's why I'm eager to grow up.

34
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,279
But...

35
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,639
Mother.

36
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,440
But...

37
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,839
I'm planning

38
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:12,440
to send Xiaoyao to Mount Jade.

39
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,319
Grandpa.

40
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,919
Please.

41
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:16,440
Please don't send Xiaoyao away.

42
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,559
I will protect her.

43
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,080
With your current abilities,

44
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,199
you can't protect her at all.

45
00:01:24,279 --> 00:01:26,639
If anyone wants to hurt her,

46
00:01:26,839 --> 00:01:28,959
are you going to beg them

47
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,680
like what you're doing right now?

48
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:36,959
Princess,

49
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,199
time to set out.

50
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,919
When you miss me,

51
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:46,160
take it out and look at it.

52
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,199
Check it often.

53
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,639
Don't forget about me.

54
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,080
I will bring you back

55
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,599
from Mount Jade as soon as possible.

56
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,959
I'll wait for you.

I mistook you for someone else.

76
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:09,240
Are you alright?

77
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,360
Sorry.

78
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,279
Really sorry.

79
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,639
Did it hurt you?

80
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,160
No.

81
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,679
These rustics

82
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,440
are dirty and smelly.

83
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,399
I have an old friend
who came to this town,

84
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:24,919
but I don't know where she is.

85
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,520
I heard that you know everything,

86
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:29,080
so I want to ask you
for help to find her.

87
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,119
It's been many years.

88
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,080
I'm not very clear about her appearance.

89
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,279
She has a peach blossom-shaped

90
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,759
birthmark in the middle of her forehead.

91
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,520
I wonder if you can see the true face

92
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:37,800
through illusions

93
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,880
when looking for people.

94
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,279
I don't have enough spirit power.

95
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,679
I can transfer my spirit power to you.

96
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:42,639
Master.

97
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:43,880
If you use too much spirit power,

98
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:45,440
your body can't bear it.

99
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,080
Master.

100
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,520
That's enough.

101
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:55,399
Why did it stop on them?

102
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:57,039
I know this physician very well.

103
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:57,960
His name is Wen Xiaoliu.

104
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,720
He has lived in the town
for several decades.

105
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,119
I'm looking for a woman,

106
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:02,199
not a man.

107
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,199
I've searched all over the town.

108
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:05,639
The one you're looking for

109
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:07,520
is definitely not in this place.

110
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,520
I heard some noise yesterday.

111
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,479
Seems like someone moved in.

112
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,040
But I don't know what they do.

113
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:18,640
Maybe it's a friendly neighbor.

114
00:04:18,752 --> 00:04:19,320
I'm leaving.

115
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,200
I'm Xuan.

116
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,679
What do you do for a living?

117
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,959
I learned how to brew alcohol.

118
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:28,160
I'm planning to open a winery.

119
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
Nice to meet you.

120
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,160
That is

121
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,640
just what this street is lacking.

122
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,559
I'll be right back.

123
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,640
It's your favorite,
Yingzhou Jade Plum Blossom.

124
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,320
It's not the cold winter, so we can't

125
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,519
see the plum blossoms.

126
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,760
Brother.

127
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,119
Look. So many plum blossoms.

128
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,160
I'm Xuan.

129
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:23,079
Our maid Haitang

130
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,000
was poisoned by you.

131
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,040
Please

132
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,000
give us the antidote.

133
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,000
If your sister kneels

134
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,920
and apologizes to my brother,

135
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll give the antidote

136
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,760
to you.

137
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:31,920
Please give me the antidote.

138
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,600
If I don't give you the antidote,

139
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:35,320
are you going to snatch it?

140
00:05:35,392 --> 00:05:35,936
Forgive me.

141
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:39,720
I just want the antidote.

142
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,440
I didn't expect your spirit power
was so weak.

143
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:42,200
Are you okay?

144
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,440
Get lost.

145
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,079
You...

146
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,000
We've got the antidote.

147
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:45,720
Let's go back.

148
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,959
Your visit graces our humble shop.

149
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,200
Welcome.

150
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,440
Give me a pot

151
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,480
of your sweet wine here.

152
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,320
Osmanthus wine.

153
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,399
It's sweet and smooth.

154
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,559
This is so sour.

155
00:05:58,559 --> 00:05:59,880
Are you selling vinegar?

156
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:01,359
I see you sell

157
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:02,799
something called tiger penis wine.

158
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,119
The one they're drinking.

159
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,600
Get me a jug of that to taste.

160
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,959
The taste of this wine is off.

161
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,839
If someone drinks your tiger penis wine,

162
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:12,920
I'm afraid

163
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,519
they'd never have an erection again.

164
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:17,559
If you're still not satisfied,

165
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,640
I'll get you another one.

166
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,839
These lychees are quite fresh.

167
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:23,760
Let me try.

168
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,359
My sister has been having
a poor appetite,

169
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,640
so I specially got some fruits
she likes for her.

170
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,359
Xiaoliu, please stop teasing me.

171
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:31,160
I'm sorry for the offense last time.

172
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:32,160
I apologize to you.

173
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,279
Let your sister apologize to Mu.

174
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,839
I'll apologize to Mu instead.

175
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,000
As her elder brother,

176
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
I should take responsibility.

177
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:41,239
I heard the mulberry wine here
is very good.

178
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,320
Send a few jars
of the best mulberry wine

179
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,679
to the Rejuvenation Hall

180
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,000
and apologize to Mu.

181
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,359
If Mu accepts it,

182
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,399
from then on,

183
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,880
I won't come to your shop again.

184
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,959
My sister offended you the other day.

185
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:53,760
I apologize on her behalf with the wine.

186
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,760
You're indeed generous.

187
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,679
Let's forget about this.

188
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,600
No one needs to mention it anymore.

189
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,880
With your status,

190
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,079
why stoop down

191
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:08,839
to apologize to a commoner?

192
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,519
An unknown physician like Wen Xiaoliu

193
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,799
used poison to defeat Haitang.

194
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,359
Who knows how many other methods he has?

195
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,359
If he comes

196
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:16,640
or poison us again,

197
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,640
it will be troublesome.

198
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,119
We have important things to do,

199
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,640
best not to complicate matters.

200
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,200
Xiang Liu was injured this time,

201
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,640
but the helpers I brought
were all killed by him.

202
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,160
Since he can't be used by me,

203
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,440
I have to strike first.

204
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,279
Remove

205
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,839
the threat right now.

206
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,720
Yes. I see.

207
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:35,880
Careful. It's hot.

208
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,880
I'm starving,

209
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,519
and I followed the aroma and came in.

210
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,600
I'm glad to see you.

211
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,760
How about having a meal

212
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:43,720
with me?

213
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:44,640
No problem.

214
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:46,119
It's freshly brewed.

215
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,160
Try it.

216
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:55,440
What are you doing?

217
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,640
Chicken.

218
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,239
Try it.

219
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,600
Great cooking.

220
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,600
Unexpectedly,

221
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,720
you can both make wine

222
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,720
and cook.

223
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,880
Nian is really fortunate.

224
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:09,160
If Nian makes more offenses
in the future,

225
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,040
could you please

226
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,320
be a bit lenient

227
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,679
to her?

228
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,760
You're really a good brother.

229
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:18,279
Being your sister is really fortunate.

230
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,600
Actually, I'm not a good brother.

231
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:22,720
Thank you for your hospitality today.

232
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:23,720
It's getting late.

233
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,600
I'll take my leave.

234
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:25,399
See you.

235
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:27,279
Feel free to visit.

236
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:28,239
Okay.

237
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,359
I know this place well.

238
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,848
No need to see me out.

239
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,599
Has Xiaoliu been busy lately?

240
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,479
I wanted to invite him
to taste the new wine,

241
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,000
but I haven't seen him.

242
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,200
The wine is too strong.

243
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:44,599
Xiaoliu doesn't like it.

244
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,840
What wine does he prefer?

245
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,000
Mulberry wine.

246
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,640
Because mulberry wine

247
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,840
reminds him

248
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,320
of his brother.

249
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:53,559
Who's his brother?

250
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,520
Who exactly is Wen Xiaoliu's brother?

251
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,520
His brother is Mu.

252
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,520
Thank you.

253
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,840
Xiaoliu, please go ahead.

254
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,320
Skinny wants to marry Sang Tian'er.

255
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,280
it is Skinny's lifelong matter,

256
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,719
So I have to

257
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,280
ask for your help brazenly.

258
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:15,960
Why do you think

259
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,200
I can help you on this matter?

260
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:20,039
I don't know the real identities
of yours and Nian's.

261
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:21,599
But as you are not ordinary,

262
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,479
I believe

263
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:24,080
as long as you kindly

264
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,440
step back,

265
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,559
you could definitely help me.

266
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,039
Speaking of real identity,

267
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,599
I'm interested in you.

268
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,200
I have lived here

269
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,200
for almost 30 years.

270
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:36,320
The only thing I ask for

271
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,039
is nothing more than

272
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,039
a peaceful and healthy family.

273
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:40,280
I hope

274
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,359
you could help me.

275
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,599
A peaceful family?

276
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,919
What you ask for

277
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,039
is more than what ordinary people
ask for.

278
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:50,359
If possible,

279
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,679
I also hope to live a tranquil life

280
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,479
with my family.

281
00:09:57,599 --> 00:09:58,440
Remember to invite me

282
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,039
to the wedding.

283
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,400
Alright.

284
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,520
Thank you.

285
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:07,960
Shiqi.

286
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,000
Mr. Xuan.

287
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,719
We have to go.

288
00:10:10,912 --> 00:10:11,520
Thank you.

289
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,400
Thank you.

290
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,359
See you.

291
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,039
I'm sorry.

292
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,119
Xiang Liu got away.

293
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:18,559
Xiang Liu is coming.

294
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,960
Since he dares to come,

295
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,359
I'll go and confront him.

296
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,640
I give you two choices.

297
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,640
Work for me,

298
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,799
and I will treat you well.

299
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,239
If you continue to hide
in the mountains,

300
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:27,679
colluding with rebels

301
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:28,840
to cause trouble,

302
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,119
I will kill you.

303
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:21,039
Your Highness,
the princess had been abducted.

304
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,440
The kidnapper wants herbs.

305
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,919
Come on. Stop crying.

306
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:29,840
Take him back.

307
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,039
Get the most experienced interrogator.

308
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,960
(Just leave Wen Xiaoliu alive.)

309
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:37,919
Xuan, don't go.

310
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,159
I'm here.

311
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,440
I'm not going anywhere.

312
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:43,640
I won't leave you.

313
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,320
If anyone bullies you again,

314
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,640
don't fight them alone.

315
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,440
Call me.

316
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,239
I'll do it.

317
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:51,760
I will protect you.

318
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,039
Don't be scared.

319
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:54,640
As long as I cultivate hard,

320
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:56,559
my spirit power will keep growing.

321
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,599

00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:37,320
Don't worry.

382
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,840
When you leave,

383
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,320
I will definitely remove the bug.

384
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,640
The bug doesn't really harm you.

385
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,239
It can only make you suffer

386
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:45,840
from what I'm suffering.

387
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:46,960
As long as you don't harm me,

388
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,840
you won't suffer.

389
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,672
Okay.

390
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,840
When you have time,

391
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,119
come to the winery for drinks.

392
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,880
Okay.

393
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,919
(The Second Princess
is such a light drinker.)

394
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,080
(How dare she compete with you.)

395
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,599
(The Great Princess)

396
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,880
(liked to drink when she was little.)

397
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,159
(She has grown up,)

398
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,280
(and must not be a light drinker.)

399
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:15,799
(You both are children
of noble families.)

400
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,200
(Why did you come
and suffer in Qingshui Town?)

401
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,320
For my sister.

402
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,719
For Nian.

403
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,000
For taking her out to travel.

404
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,320
You really aren't afraid of death.

405
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:37,719
There are various poisons in this world,

406
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:39,119
but it all has its complements

407
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:40,159
and constraints.

408
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:41,640
The same goes for the poisoning.

409
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,280
The methods of detecting

410
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,440
and avoiding poison are secret,

411
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,520
but you didn't hold back but taught me.

412
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,440
I don't even know
how to express my gratitude.

413
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,440
Your safety is what matters.

414
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:52,400
We're friends.

415
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,280
We could save the courtesy.

416
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:55,280
I know many people,

417
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,119
but I don't have many friends.

418
00:15:58,119 --> 00:15:58,624
Come on.

419
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,640
Cheers. To friendship.

420
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,880
How are you in Qingshui Town?

421
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:08,479
I wandered around,

422
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,320
and just ended up here.

423
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,960
You are quite familiar
with Xiang Liu with Nine Lives, right?

424
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,520
Such questions

425
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,280
are not suitable while drinking.

426
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:17,640
What about you?

427
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,280
You and Nian

428
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,159
are just cousins?

429
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,479
This question is quite suitable

430
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,640
for discussing over drinks.

431
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:26,880
Tell me.

432
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,039
This is my little sister
Xiaoyao's treasure.

433
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,039
She gave it to me when we parted.

434
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,919
She said I could play it temporarily.

435
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,679
But

436
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,599
300 years have passed.

437
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,000
Xiaoyao is the daughter

438
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,760
of my aunt and my master.

439
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:47,719
She was lost when she was little.

440
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,919
They all said she died,

441
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,039
but I always hold onto a glimmer of hope

442
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,080
that she's still alive,

443

Nian is also my master's daughter.

446
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,319
I pamper her,

447
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,119
just like pampering Xiaoyao.

448
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,959
Drink, Xuan.

449
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:14,760

I can't wait to play.

I heard that you excel at music, chess,
calligraphy and painting,

461
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:42,599
but I never got to play with you.

462
00:17:43,168 --> 00:17:43,719
Xiaoliu,

463
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:45,560
let Shiqi play a round with me.

464
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,112
Fine.

465
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:47,239
But I want to play.

466
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,280
Alright.

467
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,040
You move,

468
00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:51,160
and he gives advice.

469
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:52,000
Let's play.

470
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:08,760
It's your turn.

471
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,239
I think it's better to move here.

472
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,400
You have

473
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,520
messed it up.

474
00:18:18,176 --> 00:18:18,688
Alright.

475
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,920
I'll see what you can do.

476
00:18:27,479 --> 00:18:28,280
How about this?

477
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,719
You really can
make a silk purse of a sow's ear.

478
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,560
Master Qingqiu,
you truly do live up to your reputation.

479
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,199
You managed to save
Xiaoliu's helpless games

480
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,040
over and over again.

481
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,319
You should go and rest earlier.

482
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:46,319
I'll clean them up.

483
00:18:46,368 --> 00:18:46,959
It's okay.

484
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,479
It'll be done soon.

485
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:05,079
My Lord, watch out!

486
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,719
My Lord.

487
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,000
The moment this arrow
pierced your chest,

488
00:19:14,199 --> 00:19:15,199
what did you feel?

489
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:17,359
I felt a chill creep over me.

490
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,119
I got it.

491
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,239
The Ice Crystal.

492
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:20,400
All darkness

493
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:22,040
will disappear under the sun.

494
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,079
Everything

495
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:24,839
can be cleaned

496
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:25,719
with the Tanggu water.

497
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:27,599
But Tanggu is thousands of miles away.

498
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,119
I'm afraid I would have bled out

499
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:30,119
before I can get there.

500
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:31,079
I have a way.

501
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:31,920
Xuan.

502
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,479
Wait for me.

503
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,199
I'll be right back.

504

Xiaoliu.

505
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,199
Actually, this is all my business.

506
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,719
It has nothing to do with you.

507
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:39,719
You don't have to go to such trouble.

508
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,359
Without the poisonous bug,

509
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:43,000
you might not have been hit
by the arrow.

510
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,239
This happened because of me.

511
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,760
It has something to do with me.

512
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:46,920
I'll be right back.

513
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,959
It works.

514
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:50,760
