00:00:05,056 --> 00:00:07,296
(Lost You Forever S1 Special Edition 9)

3
00:00:08,079 --> 00:00:08,800
Xuan,

4
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:10,079
are we there?

5
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:10,720
Yeah.

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,199
This is Qingshui Town?

7
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:14,000
It looks quite ordinary.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,200
I'll see how many outlaws there are.

9
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,959
I will get them back to Wushen Mountain

10
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:19,040
and make them my servants.

11
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,440
Don't you watch where you're going?

12
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,479
Sorry.

13
00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:24,040
Really sorry.

14
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:27,760
How dare you!

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,440
I'll make it up for you.

16
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,479
Selling you wouldn't be
enough to compensate.

17
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:32,560
Hey, how can you talk like that?

18
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,840
Isn't it just a dress?

19
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,840
You ignorant person.

20
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,279
Who is ignorant?

21
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,360
Move.

22
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,840
Teach him a lesson.

23
00:00:56,279 --> 00:00:57,840
It's terrible.

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,680
He has given up.

25
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,959
Miss,

26
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,000
please stop.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,160
Go on.

28
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:04,680
Yes.

29
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,080
According to the rules of Qingshui Town,

30
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,639
without a mortal grudge,

31
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:09,639
one should stop
once the opponent admits defeat.

32
00:01:09,839 --> 00:01:10,480
My rule is,

33
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,720
whoever offends me must die.

34
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,279
What are you

35
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:28,239
doing at this hour?

36
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:29,760
You ugly hag.

37
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,160
kill him.

38
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,360
You ugly hag.

39
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,080
You stop!

40
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,160
Come on.

41
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,080
I'm talking to you.

42
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,360
If I catch you, you'll be dead.

43
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,879
Come on, hag.

44
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,239
You stop!

45
00:01:42,639 --> 00:01:43,480
Haitang.

46
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:45,319
Are you scared now?

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,680
Aren't you chasing me?

48
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,360
Come on.

49
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,279
Scared of you?

50
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:49,080
You're not worthy.

51
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,480
What do you want to do?

52
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,680
Put me down.

53
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,480
Did you hear that?

54
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:07,279
If you don't put me down,

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,160
I'll chop off your hands.

56
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:11,559
You lowly person.

57
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:12,679
How dare you!

58
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:13,360
You're too heavy.

59
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,360
I'm tired.

60
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,800
What do you eat every day?

61
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,240
Noble lady,

62
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:20,479
you must have never been tied up
like this before, right?

63
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:25,279
Do you want to see
the face under the mask?

64
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,279
Definitely not worse than your cousin's.

65
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,880
Who cares?

66
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:31,479
Unbelievable.

67
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,399
She fell asleep.

68
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:36,039
Hurry up.

69
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:37,800
Xuan will never let you off.

70
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,639
You'll be dead.

71
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,199
Sit.

72
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,800
You...

73
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,000
What did you feed me?

74
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,880
Poison.

75
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:55,839
You lowly man.

76
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:56,919
How dare you!

77
00:02:58,679 --> 00:02:59,279
Xuan.

78
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,800
Xuan will definitely detoxify me.

79
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,559
Considering

80
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:02,839
what you just said, I should

81
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:04,039
poison you with another type.

82
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,919
Let me see.

83
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:07,440
I will kill you.

84
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,440
What?

85
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,600
Do you want me

86
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,479
to find an acupuncture point
on your chest?

87
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,080
Come on.

88
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,520
Come on.

89
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:18,559
Don't cry.

90
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,559
Come on.

91
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:22,279
Don't cry.

92
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:28,839
You're safe now.

93
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,119
I'm here.

94
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:30,919
I'm here.

95
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,520
Take him back.

96
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:39,399
My Lord, watch out!

97
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,520
Didn't you say

98
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,759
it was not serious?

99
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,080
Why is he

100
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,080
still bleeding?

101
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,880
Isn't Wen Xiaoliu

102
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,080
good at poison?

103
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,160
Why not ask him for help?

104
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,600
Yes.

105
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,880
I'll go find him right now.

106
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,440
I told you to get out.

107
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,279
Come with me.

108
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,479
I'll give you a lot of money.

109
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,360
I'm here to ask you

110
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,279
to save Xuan.

111
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:00,880
What happened?

112
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,199
He...

113
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,000
He got injured.

114
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,240
The physician tried many methods,

115
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,240
but the bleeding persists.

116
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,039
So, are you coming

117
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,080
or not?

118
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:16,920
Yes.

119
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:21,079
Why are you still bleeding?

120
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,359
Can you do it or not?

121
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:22,799
Nian,

122
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:23,880
go and get some rest.

123
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,600
Do what I say.

124
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,904
(Yiqing Garden)

125
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,279
On such a hot day, it's best

126
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,160
to cool down in Yiqing Garden.

127
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,440
It's a pity

128
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,640
that my mother won't go out.

129
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:44,679
W-Why are you here?

130
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:45,880
W-Why can't I be here?

131
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,160
This is my home.

132
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,519
You lowly person can't be here.

133
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,600
Somebody,

134
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,760
arrest him.

135
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,559
Return to Hanzhang Hall.

136
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:53,640
Tell me.

137
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,040
Do you know your mistake?

138
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:55,679
You

139
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,239
finally fell into my hands.

140
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,320
Xuan said

141
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,760
you saved his life.

142
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,279
Okay.

143
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,679
So, I won't take your life.

144
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,040
But you can't escape

145
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,880
punishment.

146
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,799
That day...

147
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,679
I must have my revenge.

148
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,040
Hold out his hands.

149
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,959
Hit his hands.

150
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,079
Even if my hands are broken,

151
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:16,079
it is still worth it to touch it once.

152
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:16,679
Shut up.

153
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,359
Shut him up.

154
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,519
Do it.

155
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:22,760
Hit his hands first,

156
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:24,160
and then his mouth.

157
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll take responsibility if he dies.

158
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:29,440
Father.

159
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,679
Someone assaulted me.

160
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:31,679
Wen Xiaoliu

161
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,839
was so disrespectful.

162
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,640
H-He even touched

163
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,839
my hand

164
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,839
and my back.

165
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,079
I promise

166
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,959
you won't mind him

167
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,239
taking advantage of you.

168
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:44,880
What would make

169
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,959
a woman

170
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,880
not mind a man

171
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,760
taking advantage of her?

172
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,600
And it's good news.

173
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:54,799
Oh my goodness.

174
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,839
Is he making me marry that rogue?

175
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,279
I will never marry you.

176
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:02,760
I didn't think of marrying you.

177
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,239
Is that true?

178
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,079
Of course.

179
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,760
Then you should do worse

180
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,799
so that I'll forgive you.

181
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,480
Before I make the announcement,

182
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,760
you go to Mount Jade.

183
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,760
This inn in Zhiyi

184
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,079
(Inn)
belongs to the Haoling.

185
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,760
Let's rest here for the night

186
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,040
and head to Mount Jade tomorrow.

187
00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:19,320
Let's go sightseeing

188
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,279
and have some fish.

189
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,640
Great.

190
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,880
When did you become so close?

191
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,079
Who is close to him?

192
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,279
What a nice song.

193
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,079
You haven't heard

194
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,239
anything good.

195
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:40,640
Excuse me.

196
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:42,760
Bring us some of your grilled food.

197
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,359
Say it.

198
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,679
Go away.

199
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:51,200
You're so rude.

200
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:52,880
You can turn us down

201
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:53,880
if you don't wish

202
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,799
to sell us your food.

203
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:56,160
Why tease her and hit her?

204
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,799
We teased her and hit her?

205
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:59,640
Who was rude in the first place?

206
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,640
Who bragged first?

207
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,600
Who started the fight?

208
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,640
The maid

209
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:04,000
learned from her master.

210
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,839
I was wondering

211
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,040
what kind of people

212
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,119
would drive such a ship

213
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:08,359
and be a disgrace.

214
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:09,440
Then I saw you.

215
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,359
Your ship looks just like you.

216
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,760
Apologize now.

217
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,000
Or I will take measures.

218
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,519
Fine,

219
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,480
I'd like to admire

220
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,559
your measures.

221
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:22,920
Let's go.

222
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,760
I can't swim.

223
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,880
Don't be scared.

224
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,959
You won't be scared.

225
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:36,679
Aren't you scared?

226
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:38,079
Instead of shedding tears,

227
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:39,760
it's better to open your eyes wide

228
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,679
and see the road ahead clearly.

229
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:43,279
In a few days,

230
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,880
I will make a serious announcement.

231
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,839
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

232
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:47,880
Father.

233
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,279
Who is she?

234
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,480
Why can she sit here?

235
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,679
She is my eldest daughter,

236
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,239
Jiuyao.

237
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,040
Are you really

238
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,959
my father's daughter with another woman?

239
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:55,799
I don't have a sister.

240
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:56,799
She is not my sister.

241
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:58,040
She is one of the family.

242
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,040
You speak up for her.

243
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,079
What about me?

244
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,640
Who will you speak up for

245
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,000
between her and me?

246
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,359
Answer me.

247
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,640
I hope you and Xiaoyao get along well.

248
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,480
I don't want any sister.

249
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,079
Is it very painful?

250
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,959
Your father and brother
have both abandoned you.

251
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,559
All of you only have her in your eyes.

252
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:24,600
If it weren't for her,

253
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,480
you would still be
the only princess of Haoling,

254
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,040
and the only sister of your brother.

255
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,839
But that woman suddenly

256
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:32,000
came out of nowhere

257
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,280
and took away everything from you.

258
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,880
Don't you want to get revenge?

259
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:43,400
What on earth do you want to do?

260
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
You're not thinking about

261
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:45,400
pushing me down, are you?

262
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,080
You guessed it right.

263
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:51,159
(Did you forget that I could swim?)

264
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,960
How could she not come back last night?

265
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,280
Has she died?

266
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,840
Great Princess.

267
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,239
You made me

268
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:06,479
like this.

269
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,400
Happy now?

270
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,559
Well.

271
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,400
Sort of.

272
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,840
You nuts.

273
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,679
I swear I will beat you

274
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,679
to death today.

275
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,919
Weren't you going to beat me?

276
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,200
Come on.

277
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,520
Don't just talk the talk.

278
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,239
Hit me?

279
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:22,919
Put it down!

280
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,479
How dare you!

281
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,119
I'll kill you.

282
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:33,880
I'll kill you.

283
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,080
Your Highness.

284
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,719
Haoling Yi.

285
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:41,479
Other than using your identity

286
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:42,679
and spirit power to bully others,

287
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,400
what else can you do?

288
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,239
You think you're better than me?

289
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:47,119
If your mother weren't Princess General,

290
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,679
Xuan would care about you?

291
00:09:48,719 --> 00:09:50,479
Actually, you're even worse than me.

292
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:52,719
You are just resenting

293
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:53,679
your mother's lowly status.

294
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:54,919
I'm not.

295
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,719
My mother is the best mother
in the world.

296
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:58,320
I won't let you speak ill of her.

297
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,080
I know what you just meant.

298
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,000
Can you deny it?

299
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:05,719
You've never thought that way?

300
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,840
How about exchanging mothers?

301
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,479
No!

302
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:10,479
Absolutely not!

303
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:11,679
My mother is mine!

304
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,520
There are two options

305
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,840
for you now.

306
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,400
Option one.

307
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,679
We become enemies.

308
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,719
You keep picking on me,

309
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:22,880
even teaming up with outsiders
to deal with me.

310
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,080
As a result,

311
00:10:24,479 --> 00:10:25,919
you'll make our father sad

312
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:27,479
and ultimately lose Cang Xuan.

313
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:28,320
Option two.

314
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,479
We live in peace.

315
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,440
We don't irritate each other.

316
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,400
In this case,

317
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,479
our father will be happy.

318
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:34,880
Cang Xuan will protect

319
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,719
and love you.

320
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:36,880
Isn't there a third option?

321
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,000
Actually, there is.

322
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,159
We

323
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:40,640
get along well.

324
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,239
So,

325
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:44,479
you will be loved
by our father, Cang Xuan,

326
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,880
and me.

327
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,479
Do you want to continue fighting?

328
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:51,000
From now on,

329
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:52,320
we live in peace.

330
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:54,880
Okay.

331
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:55,640
We are even.

332
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,039
I still feel uneasy to allow Nian

333
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,000
to go to Xiyan Town.

334
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,520
But if I don't let her go,

335
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,479
(Zhaoyun Hall)
she'll be like a bird caged in.

336
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:15,840
Cang Xuan
and Great Princess are in Xiyan Town.

337
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,159
They'll take care of her.

338
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:17,719
Your Majesty.

339
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:21,359
Xuan,

340
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:22,679
why are you back so late?

341
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,559
Xuan,

342
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,479
didn't you promise me yesterday

343
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:31,080
you wouldn't hang out with them anymore?

344
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,719
Everyone was there today.

345
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:35,039
I should go.

346
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,000
Today you use this excuse,

347
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,799
tomorrow that excuse.

348
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:38,119
You're full of reasons.

349
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:40,679
Women should butt out of men's business.

350
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,400
Xuan.

351
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,679
Xuan.

352
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,440
(Qi Garden)

353
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,880
The beauties are here.

354
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,880
What else matters?

355
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,799
How did you become like this?

356
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:58,119
I'm going back to Haoling,

357
00:11:58,599 --> 00:11:59,880
and I'll never ever come back.

358
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,320
Xuan

359
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,840
is with Chenrong Xinyue now?

360
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:14,080
Cang Xuan made his choice.

361
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,039
You can't be his one and only.

362
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:19,200
Forget about him.

363
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:20,760
Father.

364
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,479
Find me a husband.

365
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:24,080
I don't want Xuan anymore.

366
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,880
I'm sure

367
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,719
among all the admirable men in Haoling,

368
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:28,400
I can find someone better.

369
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,039
He's also fine.

370
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,280
Keep him.

371
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,599
Why don't you

372
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,080
open your eyes

373
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,679
and look closer?

374
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,679
You, then.

375
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:49,760
I think you're the best.

376
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,520
You are back.

377
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,679
Not missing any limbs, huh?

378
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,280
Your 10,000-year Water Chalcedony

379
00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:08,039
would have healed me

380
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,000
anyway.

381
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,039
That's just the leftover food

382
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:13,840
of my spirit beasts.

383
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:15,080
So,

384
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:16,479
thank you.

385
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,679
You!

386
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,520
A princess

387
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,239
almost got killed by the bullies.

388
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:24,239
So useless.

389
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:25,840
If it's up to me, you should

390
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,000
stay on Wushen Mountain.

391
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,599
Father will make sure

392
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,719
that nobody bullies you.

393
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:30,320
Okay.

394
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:31,679
I'll do as you say.

395
00:13:35,322 --> 00:13:37,530
(Mingse Hall)

396
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,479
Xuan is in deep trouble.

397
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:40,719
The Daming Hall collapsed.

398
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,640
The King of Xiyan sent Xuan's archenemy

399
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,200
Yueliang to look into this.

400
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,039
Shan Hu, Miao Pu.

401
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,479
Pack up.

402
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:47,479
We're going back.

403
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,799
I'm coming with you.

404
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:49,599
May I?

405
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:51,280
I heard my father is choosing

406
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,280
a husband for you.

407
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,679
You don't like any of those young men?

408
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:55,119
They're no match for Xuan.

409
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:01,080
I see you as my sister.

410
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,320
So I don't want you

411
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,119
to fall for Cang Xuan.

412
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,679
Cang Xuan

413
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,280
never cares about romance.

414
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:09,479
Nian,

415
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:10,679
let Father find you

416
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:12,479
a good husband in Haoling.

417
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,479
Stop thinking about Cang Xuan.

418
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,400
I've been trying to forget him

419
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,479
for 40 years,

420
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:24,880
but I can't.

421
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,919
Xiaoyao,

422
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,080
in this world,

423
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:29,799
apart from Father and Mother,

424
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,440
only you can help me.

425
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,080
Xiaoyao.

426
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,919
Help me, please.

427
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,320
I have something to say to you.

428
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,119
What do you want to say?

429
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:42,080
I'm going to get married.

430
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,599
I've already written to Grandfather,

431
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
asking for his approval.

432
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,080
Are you marrying Chenrong Xinyue?

433
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,880
I'm marrying Shen Shuhui.

434
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
The chief of the Shen...

435
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,479
Princess.

436
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:00,840
You don't need to be so formal.

437
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,479
We are all family now.

438
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,080
Nian.

439
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,119
Nian,

440
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:14,799
what you did today was inappropriate.

441
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,119
Shuhui is Cang Xuan's legal wife.

442
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:18,119
If you don't respect her,

443
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:19,000
others seeing it

444
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,400
will think you are belittling Cang Xuan.

445
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,239
How much effort does he have to put in

446
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:24,440
to make up for it
every time you lose your temper?

447
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,000
That's not what I meant.

448
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,400
I know you didn't mean that,

449
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,400
but once you've done it,

450
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,799
that's how others see it.

451
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,080
Respecting Shuhui

452
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,479
is respecting him.

453
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,640
The only thing you need to do

454
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,479
is to control your temper

455
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:36,559
and not vent your anger

456
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:38,479
at his women.

457
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,080
Am I very stupid?

458
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,880
You guys

459
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,440
always have to worry about me.

460
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,159
Being too smart is not a good thing.

461
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,799
Dullness can bring luck.

462
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,039
So, for the sake of good luck,

463
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:52,119
should I continue to be dull?

464
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:53,960
Yes.

465
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,719
keep being dull.

466
00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:58,080
I hope

467
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,440
you can be the luckiest girl

468
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,599
in the world.
