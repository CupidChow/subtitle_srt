00:00:05,056 --> 00:00:07,296
(Lost You Forever S1 Special Edition 1)

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,600
Seven bunny babies.

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,079
The mother and the kids are fine.

5
00:00:17,159 --> 00:00:18,680
if anyone can't have a child,

6
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,399
come to my Rejuvenation Hall
and look for me, Wen Xiaoliu.

7
00:00:23,104 --> 00:00:23,680
Mu.

8
00:00:26,799 --> 00:00:28,479
Live for today and spend your money.

9
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:29,760
Don't worry about tomorrow.

10
00:00:29,984 --> 00:00:30,559
Do your job.

11
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:39,799
When did I become so accurate?

12
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:46,080
Mind my own business and worry less,

13
00:00:46,639 --> 00:00:49,479
and I'll live a long and carefree life.

14
00:00:50,919 --> 00:00:52,159
This is Qingshui Town.

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,119
We don't lack pitiful people.

16
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,279
If you want to live long,

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,159
don't get in trouble.

18
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,639
I stepped on your sesame seed cake.

19
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,760
What compensation do you want?

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,440
this person is a deity.

21
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,000
And not a low-level deity like us.

22
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:25,919
If you save someone you shouldn't,

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,680
you're asking for death.

24
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:31,959
Let's do our best

25
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,559
and leave the rest to fate.

26
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:36,879
Don't worry.

27
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,080
I'm a superb physician.

28
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,639
You'll be better soon.

29
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:41,319
Xiaoliu,

30
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,680
you are really awesome.

31
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,160
Even dead people can be saved by you.

32
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,360
I'm even more capable.

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,279
There is no hurdle

34
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,919
that can't be overcome.

35
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,440
After you recover,

36
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,000
you can start all over again.

37
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,720
Xiaoliu.

38
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,279
you take care of him too attentively,

39
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:56,639
just like taking care of a baby.

40
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,239
Others would think you were his mother.

41
00:01:58,839 --> 00:01:59,919
Are you asking for a beating?

42
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,759
Come. I'll help you undo it.

43
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,360
I've been looking after you,

44
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:15,320
cleaning your body, applying medicine

45
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,199
and washing your hair.

46
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,520
There's nothing I haven't seen.

47
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,559
I have something else to do.

48
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:30,880
Do it yourself.

49
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,000
Do it yourself.

50
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:34,720
Beggar,

51
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:38,199
from today on, your name is Ye Shiqi.

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,520
It seems that for Pimply's marriage,

53
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,119
we have to wait another two years.

54
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,839
We can't let the woman Pimply likes

55
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,240
leave him because of dowry.

56
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,440
if I can find two or three spirit herbs,

57
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,559
dowry for marriages of Pimply

58
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:55,199
and Skinny will be sufficient.

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,600
Shiqi.

60
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,919
Why did you follow me?

61
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,360
Do you have to follow?

62
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,479
I'll wait for you.

63
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:09,399
No one in this world
will wait for someone else forever.

64
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,559
When tired, they naturally leave.

65
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,039
You may go.

66
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,960
I won't catch you for money.

67
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:23,600
A physician from Qingshui Town

68
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,839
could be so powerful.

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,759
I'm really a physician.

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,320
I live at Rejuvenation Hall
by the West River in Qingshui Town.

71
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,520
I specialize in
treating women's infertility.

72
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,800
Do you have a wife

73
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,639
who are infertile?

74
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:35,800
Who

75
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,720
are you exactly?

76
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:40,479
I am just an abandoned person.

77
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:44,520
I couldn't protect myself,

78
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,520
had no one to rely on,

79
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:50,800
and nowhere to go.

80
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,759
Even if you beat me to death,

81
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,039
I still have one condition.

82
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:01,000
I will never leave Qingshui Town.

83
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:03,639
If you want to live,

84
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,440
then work for me.

85
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,039
You're a slippery eel,

86
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,720
hard to grasp.

87
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,440
I'll get my hands dirty.

88
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,160
How could I

89
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,239
meet Xiang Liu with Nine Lives?

90
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,480
How will I live through this?

91
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,799
I accidentally found two spirit herbs.

92
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,040
Mu. Pick a time
to send betrothal gifts to Butcher Gao.

93
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:26,440
You're getting a wife.

94
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,559
You are a deity.

95
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,799
When they all die,

96
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:32,359
you might still be as you are now.

97
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:34,239
Is it interesting?

98
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,239
I'm afraid of loneliness.

99
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,440
If I can't find enduring companionship,

100
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,359
brief one is also good.

101
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:44,720
Apart from the poison in the wine,

102
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,679
there's nothing of value.

103
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,279
So, have you been poisoned?

104
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:51,079
Kill me.

105
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:52,799
Kill me.

106
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,679
Mu, Pimply, and Skinny.

107
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,040
They all think I'm a good person.

108
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,399
But actually, when I was young,

109
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,160
I killed many people.

110
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,399
I haven't done it for a long time.

111
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,279
Will you help me?

112
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,079
My name is Xuan.

113
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:20,959
This is my cousin Nian.

114
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:23,160
Our maid Haitang was poisoned by you.

115
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,760
So we are here

116
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:27,079
to request you to give us the antidote.

117
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:28,519
Your sister has a brother.

118
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,440
But I also have an older brother.

119
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,799
Today, your sister offended my brother.

120
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,119
As long as your sister kneels
and apologizes

121
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:35,799
to my brother,

122
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:39,279
I'll give this bottle of antidote
to you.

123
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,239
I have no choice.

124
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,079
Shiqi.

125
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,679
I'm mad at myself.

126
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:57,040
Why would I have thoughts

127
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,160
of depending on others,

128
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,160
and put my hopes on others?

129
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,079
I clearly know the more I hope,

130
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:09,679
the more I get hurt.

131
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,079
When I was desperate and helpless,

132
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,640
I've never relied on anyone.

133
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,959
Even if I fall,

134
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,720
the only one who can catch me is myself.

135
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,399
I've always been curious.

136
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,679
How did your nine heads grow?

137
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:35,799
Did they grow in a horizontal row?

138
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,000
Or did they grow

139
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,320
in a vertical row?

140
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:41,239
Or from left to right?

141
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,720
Three on the left,

142
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,440
three on the right,

143
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:45,679
and three in the middle?

144
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:47,320
Don't your nine heads

145
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,600
fight over food?

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,359
Which one

147
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:50,944
eats first?

148
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,559
Actually, I prefer to eat mortals.

149
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:06,640
Someone like you is just enough

150
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:10,359
for each of my heads to take a bite.

151
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,679
I can't put up with this.

152
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,720
In this world,

153
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:20,000
as long as you are alive,

154
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,440
you must swallow your anger
even if it's not fair.

155
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,920
You must concede
even if you are unwilling.

156
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,279
Let me tell you.

157
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:28,880
Even those princes
and princesses live the same way.

158
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,279
How do you know?

159
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:31,359
You're not them.

160
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,559
How do you know how they live?

161
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,000
You bad kid.

162
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,440
You brat. I ought to teach you a lesson.
Is it right?

163
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,160
This is so sour.

164
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,000
Are you selling vinegar?

165
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,559
Let your sister apologize to Mu.

166
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:48,160
I'll apologize to Mu instead.

167
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,320
What a good brother,

168
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,239
willing to bend his head

169
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:54,119
rather than letting his sister suffer.

170
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,359
As her elder brother,

171
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:57,000
I should take responsibility.

172
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,000
Ye Shiqi.

173
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:14,160
you always know
what I'm thinking, don't you?

174
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,559
There won't be a second time.

175
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,440
No matter what happens,

176
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,920
I will never let you be unable
to find me

177
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,239
when you need me.

178
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:22,656
Xiaoliu!

179
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,640
Hurry.

180
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,480
Come with me to see.

181
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,279
Hurry.

182
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:33,919
Let's go.

183
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,719
Your choice.

184
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:55,119
What kind of woman do you like?

185
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,880
Is it the innocent type
like a little white rabbit,

186
00:08:58,599 --> 00:09:01,159
or the passionate type
like the one inside?

187
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,520
Why are you blushing?

188
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:09,559
Do you also want to get married?

189
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,520
Abracadabra.

190
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,559
I hope the Nine-Headed Demon

191
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,640
drowns while drinking

192
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,799
and falls to death while walking.

193
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,119
You just cursed me?

194
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:31,440
No.

195
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,119
No.

196
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,200
I'm completely yours now.

197
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,200
You can do whatever you want.

198
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,599
How the tables have turned on you!

199
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,919
Focus on healing.

200
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,200
Don't be disturbed by me.

201
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,359
You look great!

202
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:52,760
Let me show you.

203
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:00,599
Do you look great?

204
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,640
Mr. Xiang.

205
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,200
You're magnanimous.

206
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,679
Don't be angry

207
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:08,200
with someone insignificant like me.

208
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,880
If you get sick from anger,

209
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,599
you might not care,
but it would break my heart.

210
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,039
Have you bathed yet?

211
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,280
I've washed well,

212
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,119
just waiting for you.

213
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:22,520
Even though you whipped me forty times,

214
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,080
and always exploit me,

215
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,440
I don't really care.

216
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:27,919
Because...

217
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:30,119
I'm afraid of loneliness.

218
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,359
Didn't you come to me for business?

219
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,479
Is the brothel on Nanhuai Street

220
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:35,400
yours?

221
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,880
Skinny wants to marry a girl from there.

222
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,640
You want me to let her go?

223
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,479
Alright, I don't need your help.

224
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,799
I'll ask someone else.

225
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,000
Is this the business you mentioned?

226
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,640
Yes.

227
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,080
Skinny's marriage matters.

228
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,039
Bad Xiang Liu.

229
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:11,840
Bad Xiang Liu.

230
00:11:12,864 --> 00:11:13,440
Xiaoliu!

231
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:16,799
Shiqi.

232
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,880
Shiqi, my leg hurts.

233
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,000
Shiqi.

234
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:30,119
I can't walk again.

235
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,239
Shiqi.

236
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:36,039
Shiqi.

237
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:38,880
You shouldn't spoil me like this.

238
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,640
What if I get used to your care,

239
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,840
but then you leave?

240
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:44,000
What should I do then?

241
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:45,359
I won't leave.

242
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:47,320
People who make promises are countless,

243
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:50,239
but those who keep them
are hard to find.

244
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,679
Master.

245
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,159
It's been ten years.

246
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,479
I finally found you.

247
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,039
Take your time.

248
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,320
I'm leaving.

249
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,719
Master.

250
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:02,799
Six years.

251
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:04,960
I've taken you in for six years.

252
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:07,719
You exempt me from six years of rent.

253
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:09,080
From now on,

254
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:11,119
we owe each other nothing.

255
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,159
Speaking of real identity,

256
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:20,599
I'm interested in you.

257
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,159
Me?

258
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:25,239
I have lived here

259
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:27,119
for almost 30 years.

260
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:29,039
I have no connection

261
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:30,520
with any power.

262
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:32,559
I just want

263
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:33,919
to live a tranquil life,

264
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,919
watching Skinny and Pimply
get married and have children,

265
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,880
and helping Mu enjoy his old age.

266
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,880
The only thing I ask for

267
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,919
is nothing more than

268
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:43,719
a peaceful and healthy family.

269
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,520
How did you endure those thirty years

270
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,520
in the cage?

271
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,559
In the beginning,

272
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,719
I fought against the fox.

273
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,000
I always provoked him.

274
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,119
But later, I got scared
after being tortured,

275
00:12:56,119 --> 00:12:57,400
so I didn't dare to do that anymore.

276
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,760
In the end,
I stayed silent and uncooperative,

277
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,799
even trying to die.

278
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,440
Even someone like you would seek death?

279
00:13:04,832 --> 00:13:05,408
Yes.

280
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,599
But I never managed to die.

281
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,559
Our mentality

282
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,719
is really strange.

283
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,799
You can tell
whether you're happy or not,

284
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,320
or painful or not

285
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:17,359
by comparing yourself with others.

286
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,080
Do you need me to delve deeper

287
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,960
into my miserable past?

288
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:24,479
I could exaggerate it a bit.

289
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,719
I'm sure you would think

290
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:27,599
there would be

291
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,000
no other miseries.

292
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,760
You look quite different tonight.

293
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:19,200
So beautiful.

294
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,200
Life is precious

295
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,719
as long as we can enjoy such views.

296
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,559
The rarest scenery will become
dull if being seen too much.

297
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:34,400
It will only be meaningful

298
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:35,679
if there's someone by my side.

299
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,159
Sceneries are dead.

300
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,559
Only meanings from people
will bring them alive.

301
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,679
How have you been these days?

302
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:53,119
I'm good.

303
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:55,239
How are Lan Xiang and Jing Ye doing?

304
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,200
I need

305
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,679
a favor.

306
00:15:03,648 --> 00:15:04,200
Okay.

307
00:15:04,479 --> 00:15:05,840
I need a batch of herbs.

308
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:07,640
It's all written here,

309
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:08,479
very clear.

310
00:15:09,472 --> 00:15:09,984
Okay.

311
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:12,679
Once the herbs are delivered
to Qingshui Town, notify me.

312
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,000
Xiang Liu will pick it up.

313
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:16,960
Okay.

314
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,119
Well,

315
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,359
I don't have money to pay you.

316
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,799
You know that, right?

317
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,799
You don't need to pay it.

318
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,640
That's all.

319
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,760
Thank you.

320
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,400
Don't thank me anymore.

321
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:42,960
Someone from the Tushan family
leaked the location.

322
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,880
I was ambushed.

323
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,080
It was not Tushan Jing.

324
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,479
I know it wasn't him.

325
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,479
You know who it was?

326
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:51,000
Let me calm down first.

327
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,159
This concerns the lives
of thousands of soldiers.

328
00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:58,479
This is no game to pass the time.

329
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:04,119
It's... it's Xuan from the winery.

330
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:10,760
I have a way

331
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,719
to get back the herbs without battle.

332
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,080
Xuan.

333
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,239
Xuan.

334
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,280
What are you doing here?

335
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,320
If you don't leave, I won't be polite.

336
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,520
You won't be polite to me?

337
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,000
I won't be polite to you either!

338
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,919
If it weren't for Xuan,

339
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,880
I would have slapped you
many times already.

340
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:31,280
You ugly hag.

341
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,520
Haitang,

342
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:33,880
kill him!

343
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,559
If Xuan blames you,
I'll take responsibility.

344
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:36,064
Yes.

345
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:38,400
You ugly hag.

346
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,280
You stop!

347
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,200
Come on. There you go.

348
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,919
I'm talking to you.

349
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:41,880
You stop!

350
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,280
I heard he's very protective
of his family.

351
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,320
You kidnapped his sister.

352
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,239
And it's unforgivable.

353
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:53,919
He definitely wants to kill you.

354
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:56,919
You don't believe me?

355
00:16:57,472 --> 00:16:58,016
I do.

356
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,000
I believe you,

357
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,919
really.

358
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,919
But you think I am the kind of person

359
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:05,839
waiting for the danger to pass?

360
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,280
I'll hit you.

361
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,400
You're safe now.

00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,280

I'm not a businessman.

564
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:11,160
But I'm very clear about big things.

565
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:13,640
I'm ruthless to others,

566
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,800
but I'm even more to myself.

567
00:30:16,199 --> 00:30:17,599
You don't give yourself hope,

568
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
don't trust people first,

569
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,839
and don't give first.

Sang Tian'er bets on a lifetime
with false heartiness.

571
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:28,800
You treat a man with all your heart.

572
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,520
But if he doesn't cherish you,

573
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:31,920
you will abandon him.

574
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,800
I'm willing to wait.

575
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,760
Until you're ready.

I'll wait a lifetime.
