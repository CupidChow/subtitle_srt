2
00:00:05,056 --> 00:00:07,296
(Lost You Forever S1 Special Edition 6)

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,640
(Cheng'en Palace)

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,560
We've arrived.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,720
Wen Xiaoliu was trying

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,520
to escape,

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,600
so I slightly punished him.

8
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,040
Stay for a meal together.

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,559
I'm a countryman.

10
00:00:20,639 --> 00:00:22,239
It's my first time
seeing so much delicious food.

11
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:22,959
Please forgive me

12
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,760
if I behave improperly.

13
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,239
I've already asked the chef
to prepare Qingai Cake.

14
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:30,040
You can eat some
while listening to a story before bed.

15
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,719
I want to eat it

16
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:32,720
while my mother

17
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,639
tells me a story.

18
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,200
Master.

19
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:37,119
She's Xiaoyao?

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,080
(In fact, you've already
told me who you are.)

21
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:50,000
(But I was blinded by cruelty)

22
00:00:50,919 --> 00:00:52,680
(and failed to notice it.)

23
00:00:52,794 --> 00:00:57,824
♪For forever accompanying you♪

24
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:04,032
♪Let momentary sorrow and joy fly♪

25
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,239
(Break his leg.)

26
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:08,992
Xuan.

27
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:10,720
Does it hurt?

28
00:01:12,559 --> 00:01:13,639
Take good care of him.

29
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,279
(If I had kept my promise)

30
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,319
(to pick Xiaoyao up in Mount Jade,)

31
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,199
(Xiaoyao wouldn't have been lost.)

32
00:01:21,839 --> 00:01:22,639
Xiaoyao.

33
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,800
I'm going back to Zhaoyun Peak.

34
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,919
You have to go back, anyway.

35
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,680
No matter how hard the journey is,

36
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:33,680
I'm no longer embarking on it alone.

37
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:37,519
I decided to be the Princess of Haoling.

38
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,599
Are you doing it for me?

39
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,800
Not entirely.

40
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,760
Because I think

41
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,199
being a princess is not completely bad.

42
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,599
(Grandmother.)

43
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,919
(Father.)

44
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,559
(Mother.)

45
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:52,760
(Auntie. Thank you for helping me
reunite with Xiaoyao.)

46
00:01:52,919 --> 00:01:53,639
(This time,)

47
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,120
(I'll protect
my little sister for sure.)

48
00:01:57,178 --> 00:01:58,760
(Yiqing Garden)

49
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,680
I told Queen Mother
about you in the letter.

50
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,599
She agreed

51
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,480
to restore your look.

52
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:05,440
Great.

53
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:07,279
I'll go with her.

54
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:10,720
What a nice song.

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,919
If you want,

56
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,240
I'll make him play

57
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,039
for you.

58
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,639
Who's playing the flute?

59
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:21,039
It matches your zither so well.

60
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:24,520
The zither matched your flute perfectly.

61
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,320
I wonder if it's a woman playing.

62
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,919
The woman in the red gown

63
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,240
is Fangfeng Yiying.

64
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,600
It's her?

65
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:44,559
Go now.

66
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,952
Go.

67
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,360
Be careful.

68
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:55,960
Look after Nian.

69
00:02:56,096 --> 00:02:56,600
Okay.

70
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,440
Let's go.

71
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:21,039
Fortunately, it was only
a shoulder wound.

72
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,440
It didn't hit any vital parts.

73
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:23,839
Do you think

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,839
this bamboo flute is his?

75
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,639
We can ask when he wakes up.

76
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,679
I hope we didn't save the wrong person.

77
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:33,960
You're awake.

78
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,119
Where am I?

79
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:35,919
Don't get up,

80
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,000
or you may tear your wound.

81
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,199
This is the Chenrong Mansion.

82
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,720
May I ask if Chenrong Yi is...?

83
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,279
Chenrong Yi is my father.

84
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,639
My name is Chenrong Xinyue.

85
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,800
Thank you, Miss Chenrong.

86
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:46,039
Is this yours?

87
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:47,440
Yes, this is mine.

88
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,759
Is it you who was playing the flute

89
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,520
on the lake?

90
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,639
It was me.

91
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,320
Could it be that you were the one

92
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,000
who played the guqin?

93
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,119
I'm Xuan,

94
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:59,000
from Haoling's Dragon Squad.

95
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,559
I'll leave now.

96
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,440
You should stay here to recover.

97
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,039
If you don't want your family worried,

98
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:06,679
I'll have someone
deliver a message for you.

99
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,119
Thank you.

100
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:12,720
Thank you, sir,
for agreeing to play with me.

101
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,279
Miss Chenrong, you're too polite.

102
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,440
Compared to your favor
of saving my life,

103
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,559
playing a song is just small-fry.

104
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,440
The flowers in the garden
are in full bloom today.

105
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,320
I'll take you around.

106
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,839
It's time for me to take my medicine.

107
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,119
I need to go back to my room now.

108
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,519
Then next time.

109
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,920
Alright, my wound doesn't hurt anymore.

110
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,279
Don't be angry with me.

111
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,279
Unless life is threatened,

112
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,040
no one likes

113
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,839
to act by hurting themselves.

114
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,519
I had someone investigate
Fangfeng Yiying

115
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,760
after the last time I got hurt.

116
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,359
She was probably instructed by someone

117
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:46,799
to assassinate me.

118
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,480
Could it be someone from Xiyan?

119
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,920
This matter is most likely
related to my uncle.

120
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,760
It seems that the Fangfeng Family
has likely sided with him.

121
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,079
If it hadn't been for me
wanting to hear her play the guqin,

122
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:59,320
you wouldn't have
had the chance to play the flute,

123
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:01,839
and Chenrong Xinyue
wouldn't have developed

124
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,640
a liking for you.

125
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,440
If I hadn't played the flute for you,

126
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,000
I wouldn't have lured their boat over.

127
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,119
If I hadn't lured them over,

128
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:10,320
I wouldn't have encountered them

129
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,160
and wouldn't have had
all these troubles.

130
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,079
I was the victim
of your unintended harm.

131
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,920
If you hadn't met Chenrong Xinyue,

132
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,600
how would you have met people
from the Chishui and Chenrong Families?

133
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:21,119
I should thank you?

134
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:25,640
The Chenrong and Chishui Families

135
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,880
were clans you wanted
to get acquainted with and win over.

136
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,600
I didn't expect such a chance,

137
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,720
and we actually met Chenrong Xinyue.

138
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,399
Whether the Chenrong
and Chishui Families

139
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,160
will stand on our side or out

140
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,359
doesn't depend on

141
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:38,720
Chenrong Xinyue's trivial liking for me,

142
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,200
but on the benefits
I can bring them in the future.

143
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,040
You are

144
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,320
too clear-headed, too rational.

145
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,440
Fenglong, let me introduce you.

146
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,359
This is Xuan
from the Dragon Squad of Haoling.

147
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:52,200
Nice to see you.

148
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,040
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Chishui and Miss Chenrong.

149
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,239
So the friend of Jing

150
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:57,200
is you.

151
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,079
You know each other?

152
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:00,880
I heard that a court official of Xiyan

153
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,320
impeached Mr. Chenrong.

154
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:04,320
Yes, father has been
worried about this matter recently.

155
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,079
If one must say
that Mr. Chenrong is colluding

156
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:09,600
with the Chenrong rebels,

157
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,880
there's nothing wrong with that.

158
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:11,920
Hundreds of years ago,

159
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,239
when Mr. Chenrong took over
the Central Plains, he said

160
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:15,440
his loyalty goes to common people,

161
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,119
and his pursuit is peace

162
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:18,799
and well-being all over the world.

163
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,320
He never said
he would be loyal to a single man.

164
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,079
What he has been striving for is great.

165
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:24,920
Isn't the peaceful life
of Central Plains' civilians

166
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,679
important?

167
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,799
After Mr. Chenrong
took over Central Plains,

168
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:32,079
with private negotiations,

169
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,880
many betrayers surrendered,

170
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,679
which stopped many wars.

171
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,920
If it weren't
for Mr. Chenrong's collusion,

172
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,519
as Central Plains enjoyed many people,

173
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,480
there wouldn't be

174
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,119
just tens of thousands
of betrayers left,

175
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,920
hiding in Qingshui.

176
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,760
Well done.

177
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:48,880
I toast you.

178
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,359
Miss Chenrong

179
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:53,239
was quite interested in you.

180
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,679
She looks serious

181
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:57,839
because I am Xiyan Cang Xuan.

182
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:59,399
But I'm not in a position to judge her.

183
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,040
I don't refuse her

184
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,920
just because

185
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,720
she is Chenrong Xinyue.

186
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,480
I can't offend enemies,

187
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,600
nor

188
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,559
get close to someone I like.

189
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,480
But this is

190
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,160
the price I need to pay

191
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,040
to return to Xiyan Mountain.

192
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:15,200
It must be a bloody path

193
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,679
returning to Xiyan Mountain.

194
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,359
I must stand on Zhaoyun Peak

195
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,440
on my auntie's
anniversary death next year.

196
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:23,600
Cang Xuan.

197
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,239
Let's

198
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,559
go home together.

199
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,040
Okay.

200
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:29,880
Let's go home together.

201
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,760
Mother.

202
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,200
- Auntie.
- Look.

203
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,000
Look, I picked
these Poinciana flowers today.

204
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,959
Have a smell.

205
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,519
They smell so good.

206
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:47,480
I have kept you waiting so long.

207
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:49,160
What is your purpose of coming back?

208
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,640
I want the Xiyan Mountain.

209
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:52,839
And there's another reason

210
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,839
you might not believe.

211
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,279
I missed you.

212
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,279
Your two royal uncles and a few brothers

213
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,079
all want the Xiyan Mountain.

214
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,119
If you want it,

215
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:04,559
find your own way.

216
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,839
I won't help you.

217
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,000
I understand.

218
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,880
Isn't it just like the swing
from our childhood?

219
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,040
Did you really come back
for our grandfather?

220
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:12,760
Yes.

221
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,600
He is not only our grandfather,

222
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,760
but also a king.

223
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,600
To become the master
of the Xiyan Mountain,

224
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,519
do you have to be like our grandfather?

225
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:22,880
Being strong and cold.

226
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:25,559
I'm not qualified to answer it yet.

227
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,119
Because I'm not yet.

228
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,279
There's still too little

229
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,920
I can do for you.

230
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,200
Xiaoyao.

231
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,520
You just need to stand by my side,

232
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,799
and that's enough.

233
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,880
This time, I came to see you

234
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,799
for important matters.

235
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,840
There is no need
for formality between us.

236
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,719
Since you chose to return to Xiyan Town,

237
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,719
I suppose you are determined
to claim that throne.

238
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:06,400
But you left Xiyan Town
when you were young,

239
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,320
and your uncles have been
ruling for over 1,000 years.

240
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
I'm not looking down on you,

241
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,119
but what do you have
to compete with them?

242
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:12,599
I do have the ambition,

243
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,559
and it's true
that I'm struggling in Xiyan Town.

244
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,799
You could say I'm barely surviving.

245
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,640
If you have any suggestions,

246
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,760
feel free to speak.

247
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,119
All of this now belong to Xiyan.

248
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:24,000
Cang Xuan.

249
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,400
Give up Xiyan Town

250
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:26,559
and come to Central Plains.

251
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:28,679
The center of the entire Dahuang
is Central Plains.

252
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,880
One day,

253
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,599
if you want to march south,

254
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:32,760
it will also be easy.

255
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,679
A word from you

256
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,159
woke me up.

257
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:38,400
I will never

258
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,200
forget this favor.

259
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,880
Xiaoyao kept chatting with me

260
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,080
and lost track of time.

261
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:56,280
If you fail her and break her heart

262
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,359
in the future,

263
00:09:57,479 --> 00:09:59,440
I will definitely take your life.

264
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,719
If that day really comes,

265
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,960
kill me.

266
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,880
What's so good about this map?

267
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,000
It was extremely difficult

268
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,280
to come to Xiyan Town,

269
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,640
and now, it's also extremely difficult

270
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:24,239
to leave here.

271
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,799
Destroying

272
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,919
yourself

273
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:30,919
or abandoning

274
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,000
yourself,

275
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,159
which one would you choose?

276
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:39,200
This pill is called Free and Easy.

277
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,320
With just one pill,

278
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,679
you can forget all your worries.

279
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:45,200
Is there such a good thing in the world?

280
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,400
I won't harm you.

281
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,719
You must be punished.

282
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,239
You can hardly walk straight
and you're trying to support me?

283
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,159
Your Highness.

284
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:30,159
Come on.

285
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,359
Let's enjoy ourselves.

286
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,440
Your father was a renowned warrior

287
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,840
who died for his country,

288
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,080
and your mother was a heroine

289
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,080
with an unyielding spirit.

290
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,719
How could they have a son
who willingly degrades himself?

291
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:52,320
Aren't you just a snake demon
who luckily transformed into a Yinglong?

292
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,119
We gave you a bit of face

293
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:56,400
to let you guard the palace.

294
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,799
You've become so bold,

295
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,640
thinking of rebelling?

296
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:03,479
I will teach you a good lesson.

297
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,479
But now that you've chosen
to wreck yourself,

298
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,400
it's pointless to say anything more.

299
00:12:13,498 --> 00:12:15,584
(Qi Garden)

300
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:18,520
Xuan.

301
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,200
Slow down.

302
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,440
Xuan.

303
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,119
Didn't you promise me yesterday

304
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,919
you wouldn't hang out with them anymore?

305
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,559
Women should butt out of men's business.

306
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,280
Xuan.

307
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,440
I've been acting for so long,

308
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,960
and sometimes
even I can't tell if it's real or not.

309
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,280
We are ordered to capture an assassin.

310
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,559
We have to search everyone's room.

311
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,239
You're too presumptuous.

312
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,320
Search for the assassin,

313
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,719
why are you going through
cabinets and boxes?

314
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:53,799
Even His Highness's bed
must be searched.

315
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,799
Who knows if there's an assassin?

316
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:04,919
So beautiful.

317
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,520
So beautiful.

318
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:10,479
We should also search
His Highness's clothes.

319
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:13,080
There might be traces left
by the assassin.

320
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,200
I must make them believe

321
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:17,719
that I am already a useless person.

322
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:25,479
His Highness said
when the addiction strikes, he may

323
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:26,599
lose his senses and hurt you.

324
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,520
That's why I need to go in

325
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,840
and accompany him.

326
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,760
What if he hurts himself?

327
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,039
Your Highness.

328
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,719
Why not use this rope
to tie His Highness

329
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,719
to prevent him
from hurting you or himself?

330
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:39,679
No, thanks.

331
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:42,719
The only rope in the world
that can bind him

332
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,559
is his will.

333
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:46,320
Xuan.

334
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:47,919
Xuan.

335
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,359
Cang Xuan.

336
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:53,880
Cang Xuan.

337
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,320
- Let go of me.
- Cang Xuan.

338
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,039
Xuan.

339
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:04,640
Xuan.

340
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,320
Xuan.

341
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:08,479
I'm Xiaoyao.

342
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:10,520
I'm Xiaoyao.

343
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,400
Xuan.

344
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:13,960
Please bear it.

345
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,159
Bear it a little longer.

346
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,840
Please bear it.

347
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,880
Xuan.

348
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,880

00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:24,520
Are you alright?

373
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:29,640
The poison in your body
has been completely removed.

374
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,760
Congratulations.

375
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:32,400
You have recovered.

376
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,280
Thank you.

377
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,960
Now, mission is completed.

378
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:37,719
I really want to get drunk.

379
00:16:39,258 --> 00:16:40,122
♪Without you,
even the best scenery is dull♪

380
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,960
I can't hold a feast for you.

381
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,559
I can only bring wine for you.

382
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,559
What a coincidence.

383
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,559
Today, I brought home-brewed wine.

384
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,400
Congratulations.

385
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:49,320
Congratulations to me.

386
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,840
Are you sure you want

387
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,880
to tie your family
to my uncertain future?

388
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:57,400
I'm willing to follow Your Highness

389
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,520
and never regret.

390
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:03,320
From now on,

391
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,839
you and I will fight side by side.

392
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,920
Xiaoyao, I need to tell you something.

393
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:12,680
What is it?

394
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,599
I've been secretly training troops

395
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,800
and have formed my own army.

396
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:19,520
If grandfather finds out about it,

397
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,239
it will cause the family extermination.

398
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,239
I'm tired of being unable
to protect myself.

399
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,959
I want to have my own army.

400
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,359
I do need Fenglong.

401
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:29,839
If you really don't like him,

402
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,800
you don't have to push yourself for me.

403
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,040
I'll try to see Fenglong as a friend

404
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,400
and be true to him.

405
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,400
Grandfather.

406
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:41,560
Please.

407
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:43,719
I will protect Xiaoyao.

408
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:45,839
Cang Xuan,

409
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,760
with your current abilities,

410
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,880
you can't protect her at all.

411
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,439
What's wrong?

412
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,920
My heart is racing for no reason.

413
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:54,839
Jun Yi, Xiaoxiao.

414
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,560
Take some people to Zhiyi,

415
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,560
and bring Xiaoyao to me.

416
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,520
Yes.

417
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,599
I'm heading to Zhiyi.

418
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,800
We searched all around

419
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,520
but didn't see her.

420
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,400
Get reinforcement

421
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,119
to look for Xiaoyao.

422
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:04,680
Split up.

423
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,640
Xiaoyao.

424
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,319
Your Highness.

425
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:06,880
Xiaoyao.

426
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,680
Your Highness.

427
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,560
Xiaoyao.

428
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:11,199
Xiaoyao is in there.

429
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:12,439
She must be in there.

430
00:18:12,479 --> 00:18:13,920
- Xiaoyao.
- Don't go in.

431
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:14,839
I have to save Xiaoyao.

432
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:15,719
It's a deadly formation.

433
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:16,400
She's in the fire.

434
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,239
It's already activated.

435
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:18,319
I must save her.

436
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:19,599
Let go of me.

437
00:18:24,192 --> 00:18:24,800
Xiaoyao.

438
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,079
Where is Xiaoyao?

439
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,400
I've brought her back from the fire.

440
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:33,160
How is she?

441
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,719
When will she wake up?

442
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:35,920
She passed away.

443
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,079
Don't talk nonsense.

444
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:41,640
Impossible.

445
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,800
Absolutely not.

446
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:43,839
Jin Xuan.

447
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:46,520
Ask His Majesty to send best physicians

448
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,400
with best medicine now.

449
00:18:47,424 --> 00:18:48,000
Yes.

450
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,079
Give her spirit power.

451
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:51,680
Xiaoyao.

452
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,560
Don't be afraid.

453
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,800
I'm here.

454
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,239
You can't abandon me.

455
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:56,959
Didn't we have a deal?

456
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,280
We will cover the Zijin Peak

457
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,439
in Poinciana trees.

458
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,800
And I will set up a swing
like the one we had.

459
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:04,599
We will make this place our home.

460
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,359
It was a well-planned assassination

461
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,640
with a clear target.

462
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,479
It took time to plan it.

463
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:14,760
Look into it.

464
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:17,880
Once you find them,

465
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,640
keep them alive at all costs.

466
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:24,800
Your Highness.

467
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,640
I tried three tortures on him.

468
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,000
He still hasn't named his accomplice.

469
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:30,800
You can remain silent and die.

470
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,359
I will send your son
to reunite with the entire Mu family.

471
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:38,119
You're a devil!

472
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,520
You killed my little sister.

473
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,319
I swear I'll claim your life!

474
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,920
Don't try to commit suicide.

475
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,199
Think about your son.

476
00:19:46,199 --> 00:19:47,119
After investigation,

477
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:49,400
we confirmed that
there were four culprits.

478
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:51,839
The Fan and Zheng families said

479
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,319
that as long as you went easy on
Zhan Xueling and Jin Yuejian,

480
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,319
their families would pay back

481
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,599
by showing support.

482
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:00,719
You need talents at this moment.

483
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:02,199
The harm to Xiaoyao

484
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:03,479
can't be undone even if you kill them.

485
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:04,680
But if you spare them,

486
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:06,040
they will be your supporters

487
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,424
to help you achieve greatness.

488
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,640
If I choose to let go

489
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,920
of those who hurt Xiaoyao to gain power,

490
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:15,000
I'd be betraying my younger self
in the Zhaoyun Hall.

491
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,599
When you try to talk me out of it,

492
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:17,680
has it crossed your mind

493
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,359
that if I give up on Xiaoyao

494
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,199
for some reason,

495
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,199
maybe one day

496
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:26,160
I can give up on you

497
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,640
for something else?

498
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,079
I'm not a good man.

499
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:31,000
But no matter what happens,

500
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,520
I won't give up on my family,

501
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,160
you, Xiaoxiao, or Jin Xuan.

502
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,160
Whoever dares to hurt you

503
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,920
will never be spared.

504
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:44,719
I'm willing to follow an arduous path.

505
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:46,680
I'll fight through thick and thin

506
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,439
in the worst case.

507
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:49,800
Your Highness,

508
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,800
a message from Xiang Liu.

509
00:20:51,072 --> 00:20:52,400
(Promise fulfilled.
Xiaoyao will soon return.)

510
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,160
Is it news about princess?

511
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,599
Xiaoyao will be back soon.

512
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,319
Xiaoyao.

513
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:18,640
Cang Xuan.

514
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,280
Xuan.

515
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:23,959
Don't call me that.

516
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:25,680
I think about you day and night,

517
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:27,079
but look at you.

518
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:28,920
You run to see another man
as soon as you return.

519
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,640
Xuan.

520
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,760
Xuan.

521
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,920
Don't you want me anymore?

522
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:33,119
It's not me.

523
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,079
It's you who abandon me.

524
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:37,599
I often thought of you
when I was unconscious.

525
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:38,880
After I saw Xinyue,

526
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,160
I asked about you.

527
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,800
This time, I was really scared to death.

528
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,800
I was afraid that you would
be just like my mother and...

529
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:48,479
It's okay now.

530
00:21:50,138 --> 00:21:51,136
(Daming Hall)

531
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,280
Give it to Supervisor Liu.

532
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,079
Alright.

533
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:57,839
The auspicious time has arrived.

534
00:21:57,959 --> 00:22:00,520
Let the ceremony begin.

535
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,520
I, Xiyan Cang Xuan,

536
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:05,439
lead the clans of the Central Plains
to pray for peace and safety.

537
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:11,119
It collapses.

538
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,400
What happened?

539
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:13,800
How did it collapse?

540
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,640
Cang Xuan hasn't improved much.

541
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,760
You made him build a hall,

542
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,959
but he made it collapse.

543
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:19,640
What do you

544
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,479
suggest?

545
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:23,040
Since the clans

546
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,479
suspect Cang Xuan of embezzlement,

547
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:25,280
I suggest

548
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,839
we send a commissar to look into it

549
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,319
and reveal the truth.

550
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:30,280
Proceed.

551
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:30,959
Your Highness.

552
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:32,760
I found the cause of the collapse.

553
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,280
The bucket arch broke.

554
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,000
They are crisscrossed and layered

555
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:37,280
upon each other

556
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:39,920
to share the burden of the beam

557
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,040
and support the eaves.

558
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:43,079
But our bucket arch
was made from Kunwood,

559
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,000
which was solid.

560
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:45,359
How did it break?

561
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:46,160
I found white ants

562
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,239
under the broken bucket arch.

563
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:49,479
I thought they were common ants.

564
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:50,400
But the experts said that

565
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,160
those ants were bred

566
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:53,959
by chalcedony from Mount Jade

567
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,119
and could eat Kunwood.

568
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:57,119
Someone must have placed them there.

569
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:59,239
Your Lordship. I went to arrest
the carpenter Peng Shan.

570
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:01,079
But he had committed suicide at home.

571
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:03,000
We lost our key witness.

572
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:06,599
You are drafting the restoration plan
for Daming Palace?

573
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,359
Grandfather hasn't issued
the imperial order,

574
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:12,239
but Daming Palace
still collapsed under my watch.

575
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:13,599
I need to do what I should.

576
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,719
Even if there's no evidence
of embezzlement,

577
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,400
Yue Liang probably
won't let it go easily.

578
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,119
I have never cut corners,

579
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:23,040
so I'm not afraid that he'll find out
any evidence of my embezzlement.

580
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:25,199
But I worry he would follow the clues

581
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:26,520
and find out other things.

582
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:30,239
Xuan.

583
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,680
I want to go to the Xiyan Mountain

584
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:32,959
to see my grandfather.

585
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,040
Are you going to plead
with him for my sake?

586
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:36,760
That's partly true.

587
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,119
I'll go see Grandfather

588
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:39,439
and say a few words by the way.

589
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:42,239
We can't let your uncles say everything,

590
00:23:42,239 --> 00:23:44,199
and we don't even
have a chance to rebut.

591
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,719
I have something to say to you.

592
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,959
I'm going to get married.

593
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:50,479
I've already written to Grandfather,

594
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:51,760
asking for his approval.

595
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,520
Are you marrying Chenrong Xinyue?

596
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,199
No.

597
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:57,000
No?

598
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,479
I'm marrying Shen Shuhui.

599
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,880
Her family's the strongest
of the six major families.

600
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,040
Even the Chenrong royal family
had to marry them in the past.

601
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:05,040
The chief of the Shen family
has a good impression of me,

602
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,959
so he's willing
to take a risk to support me.

603
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,160
I don't care what method you use

604
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,680
or what you want to do.

605
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,680
I just want you to live well.

606
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,400
I've told you

607
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,119
I'd make Poinciana flowers bloom

608
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:21,920
all over the Chenrong Mountain.

609
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,439
Xiyan Cang Xuan,
please accept the decree.

610
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,439
Xiyan Cang Xuan was careless

611
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,880
and neglected supervision,

612
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:32,199
leading to the collapse
of the Daming Hall.

613
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:34,839
He should have been dismissed
for negligence.

614
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:37,400
Considering his sincere repentance,

615
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,920
he is specially allowed
to atone for his mistake

616
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,520
by rebuilding the Daming Hall.

617
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:42,920
Shen Shuhui from the Shen family

618
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,160
is gentle, kind

619
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:45,560
and beautiful.

620
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,920
She is specially granted to the prince,
Xiyan Cang Xuan, as a secondary wife.

621
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,839
Thank you, Your Majesty.

622
00:24:52,416 --> 00:24:56,608
♪Looking up, I saw you♪

623
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:58,599
Put down the fan.

624
00:25:01,088 --> 00:25:05,120
♪You appear in the snow♪

625
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:06,479

♪You appear as the smoke rises♪

627
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,959
The magpie brings good news,

628
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,640
and flowers bloom together.

629
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:16,040
May you two be filled with love,

630
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:17,760
and may you be blessed
with many children.

631
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,920
Congratulations.

632
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,599
Congratulations.

633
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:23,560
(We'll never be apart from each other.)

634
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,599
(Deal.)

635
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:28,479
His Majesty was attacked.

636
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,599
You are summoned

637
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,920
to the Zezhou residence.

638
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:32,880
Is Grandfather fine?

639
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,239
It was a narrow escape.

640
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,599
Sorry to disappoint you.

641
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:36,719
How can you say so?

642
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,680
Something's fishy.

643
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,640
Your Highness can't go.

644
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,920
If you go,

645
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,839
you leave your fate to His Majesty.

646
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:43,479
Even if he lets you go,

647
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:44,920
Fifth King will try to kill you.

648
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,160
I have to go.

649
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,479
If I don't go,

650
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,640
my uncle can frame me

651
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,520
for planning a coup.

652
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:51,640
All my followers will be executed.

653
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,479
I don't want to die like that.

654
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:57,040
Neither do I want you talented people

655
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,079
to die like that.

656
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,400
Cang Xuan has been industrious.

657
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:05,359
You made all the clans
so grateful to you.

658
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,959
But you married Miss Shen

659
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,119
and truly hurt our feelings.

660
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,079
Your Highness,

661
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:13,119
you probably forgot all about

662
00:26:13,199 --> 00:26:14,560
our old clans of Xiyan.

663
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,479
As the Prince of Xiyan,

664
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,800
I only married Miss Shen
to promote harmony with the clans.

665
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,280
One can only be their king
once he sees those clansmen

666
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,800
as his own citizens.

667
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:27,920
What are citizens?

668
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,880
What is a king?

669
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:31,000
In the beginning,

670
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,880
Dahuang was a united territory.

671
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,920
If Pangu, Fuxi,
or Nuwa comes back to life,

672
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:37,920
they'll see the Xiyan clan
and Chenrong clan

673
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,680
as their own citizens.

674
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,079
The Xiyan family
already rules the Central Plains.

675
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,400
How is Zhiyi different from Xiyan Town?

676
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:48,479
How dare you.

677
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:54,119
Were you only building the palace
on Chenrong Mountain?

678
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:56,000
I remember your teaching

679
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,719
and only do
what the Prince of Xiyan should do.

680
00:27:05,504 --> 00:27:07,560
My spirit power is limited.
I can only afford three shots.

681
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,359
That's enough.

682
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,479
Assassins!

683
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,119
The ceremony begins.

684
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,560
First bow to the heaven.

685
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,040
Second bow to the earth.

686
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,239
Third bow to the mountains of Chenrong.

687
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:45,719
Finished.

688
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,199
I won't announce the Crown Prince,

689
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:53,959
but who becomes
the king of Xiyan Kingdom.

690
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:58,640
This king should have a great ambition,

691
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,359
a keen mind,

692
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:01,920
a broad heart,

693
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,959
and vigorous energy.

694
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,959
Deyan.

695
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:05,959
Father.

696
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:07,640
You did a good job.

697
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,719
Thank you, Father.

698
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:12,680
You arranged a good ceremony.

699
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:14,520
The new king ascends,

700
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,439
demonstrating his power.

701
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:17,560
Cang Xuan.

702
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,119
Come here.

703
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,640
From today,

704
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:45,680
Xiyan Cang Xuan is the king
of Xiyan Kingdom.

705
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:50,839
Greetings, Your Majesty.

706
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:53,439
Greetings, Your Majesty.
