1
00:02:27,657 --> 00:02:28,907
On this trip,

2
00:02:28,908 --> 00:02:33,829
I want to do something
we haven't done yet.

3
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,397
Something fun might
be coming our way.

4
00:02:35,813 --> 00:02:36,833
We're DAY6.

5
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:38,167
No doubt about it!

6
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:39,261
Right.

7
00:02:39,335 --> 00:02:41,296
Do you think Dowoon and Brian

8
00:02:42,005 --> 00:02:45,300
have the barbecue ready?

9
00:02:45,675 --> 00:02:46,925
Those guys?

10
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,411
I doubt it. Probably
too busy having fun.

11
00:04:22,582 --> 00:04:24,876
Young K, hurry
up and come on in!

12
00:04:41,893 --> 00:04:43,858
He looks the best when
he's doing nothing...

13
00:04:45,928 --> 00:04:47,147
Guys, we're here.

14
00:04:47,864 --> 00:04:49,193
Give us a hand with this?

15
00:04:49,218 --> 00:04:50,218
Sure.

16
00:04:52,968 --> 00:04:54,090
What did you buy so much of?

17
00:04:54,421 --> 00:04:56,089
Just something to eat, and...

18
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,757
- campfire.
- Isn't it heavy?

19
00:04:58,281 --> 00:04:59,616
- What?
- Isn't it heavy?

20
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,408
It's fine.

21
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:02,725
Yeah? Glad to hear that.

22
00:05:05,077 --> 00:05:06,619
- We bought a lot.
- I know.

23
00:05:06,644 --> 00:05:07,937
We should have some beer.

24
00:05:08,364 --> 00:05:09,739
- Gonna drink beer?
- Yes.

25
00:05:09,764 --> 00:05:11,807
- We can't miss it.
- Right.

26
00:05:11,808 --> 00:05:13,142
And have a campfire.

27
00:05:13,393 --> 00:05:14,393
That sounds warm.

28
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:21,594
Dowoon already got a new friend?

29
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:23,334
Who's that old man?

30
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:28,549
That's Mr. Perfect, right there.

31
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:32,083
- They look happy.
- I know, right?

32
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:43,159
I'm warmed up now.
Feel so much better.

33
00:05:43,429 --> 00:05:44,722
It’s nice and warm here, right?

34
00:05:45,252 --> 00:05:47,420
- It really is warm.
- Yes.

35
00:05:47,445 --> 00:05:48,528
Aren't you cold?

36
00:05:48,553 --> 00:05:49,553
It's around 200 °C.

37
00:05:49,578 --> 00:05:50,828
It’s basically winter!

38
00:05:50,853 --> 00:05:52,144
Careful, you’re
gonna catch fire!

39
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:53,379
I know, right?

40
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,638
It feels nice.

41
00:05:58,666 --> 00:05:59,788
This is a good vibe.

42
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:02,123
Vibe approved?

43
00:06:02,148 --> 00:06:04,652
Vibe approved. Enough for me.

44
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:09,081
In the past ten years,

45
00:06:09,714 --> 00:06:12,390
It’s the first time for us
to go abroad on our own.

46
00:06:12,783 --> 00:06:13,993
- Right.
- Right.

47
00:06:14,802 --> 00:06:16,429
Not just in the past ten years.

48
00:06:17,234 --> 00:06:19,027
We've never been on
a trip on our own, right?

49
00:06:19,195 --> 00:06:21,237
Yes. First time traveling
abroad together.

50
00:06:21,262 --> 00:06:22,262
Right?

51
00:06:22,287 --> 00:06:24,030
- We’ve only traveled within Korea.
- Right.

52
00:06:24,097 --> 00:06:27,865
We've traveled abroad
when we were already there,

53
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,267
aside from it, haven't spent
time abroad just for a trip.

54
00:06:30,955 --> 00:06:32,690
Wow, it's been
ten years already.

55
00:06:33,662 --> 00:06:34,662
I know.

56
00:06:35,624 --> 00:06:36,762
The tenth anniversary.

57
00:06:37,618 --> 00:06:41,816
Many of our fans got married.

58
00:06:41,866 --> 00:06:44,951
Right. Ten years is
enough to get married.

59
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,170
They might have children.

60
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:49,687
I thought that was pretty cool.

61
00:06:50,236 --> 00:06:53,917
When we first began,
they were students.

62
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:55,968
And now...

63
00:06:56,162 --> 00:06:58,122
- They work.
- Yes. They got a job.

64
00:06:58,177 --> 00:07:01,679
They say the songs
they used to listen to

65
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:05,536
sound different now.

66
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:08,786
Even for us, as we
go on for ten years,

67
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:12,112
everything feels
different every time.

68
00:07:12,137 --> 00:07:13,960
Right. Probably.

69
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:17,830
All that time we spent
in the past ten years,

70
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,025
not just our songs,

71
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,343
it became good memories.

72
00:07:22,368 --> 00:07:23,369
- Right.
- Yes.

73
00:07:24,114 --> 00:07:28,201
One of My Day, who
was an employee.

74
00:07:28,426 --> 00:07:30,844
Her position was an employee.

75
00:07:30,892 --> 00:07:32,393
Her position was an employee?

76
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,928
No. What was it?

77
00:07:34,973 --> 00:07:36,056
You're not asleep, are you?

78
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,846
- Well...
- A staff member.

79
00:07:37,871 --> 00:07:39,110
Yes, she was a staff member.

80
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:42,239
She said the team manager
was giving her a hard time.

81
00:07:42,484 --> 00:07:43,572
I was like,

82
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:46,488
'Seriously team
leaders, let's not do that.'

83
00:07:46,513 --> 00:07:47,974
And she became the team manager?

84
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:51,419
No, the My Day who
are team managers said,

85
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,765
'Dowoon, I'm sorry.'

86
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,698
I think we're growing together.

87
00:07:57,723 --> 00:07:58,723
Yes.

88
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:03,437
When we first began,

89
00:08:03,462 --> 00:08:04,755
honestly,

90
00:08:06,148 --> 00:08:08,028
there were only a few.

91
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:11,569
There were so few fans

92
00:08:11,594 --> 00:08:15,081
that we could remember
their faces and names.

93
00:08:15,106 --> 00:08:16,734
It's interesting

94
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:23,716
how we get to meet more people
from diverse areas as we go on.

95
00:08:23,811 --> 00:08:24,837
I'm grateful for it.

96
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,832
Ten years ago,

97
00:08:28,653 --> 00:08:32,699
I remember imagining what
we’d be like in a decade.

98
00:08:33,031 --> 00:08:34,766
I didn't expect this.

99
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,733
With your sunglasses
on the back of your head.

100
00:08:36,758 --> 00:08:37,896
I didn't see it coming.

101
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:39,514
You look cool.

102
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:40,873
We turned out too well.

103
00:08:42,016 --> 00:08:46,235
We turned out so well
that I feel pressured.

104
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,260
Right.

105
00:08:47,331 --> 00:08:50,856
There was a time when we
couldn't even fill MUV-Hall.

106
00:08:51,325 --> 00:08:52,325
Right.

107
00:08:52,603 --> 00:08:53,895
After all,

108
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,508
we've been doing
our best, for ten years.

109
00:08:59,601 --> 00:09:03,104
We were able to do this

110
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,009
because of those who support us.

111
00:09:07,034 --> 00:09:09,957
Without My Day, our fans,

112
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,342
it would've been
difficult for me.

113
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:14,440
I used to say it like a habit

114
00:09:14,465 --> 00:09:15,465
that I wanted to quit.

115
00:09:15,914 --> 00:09:17,037
I wanted to stop.

116
00:09:17,945 --> 00:09:21,406
We were able to
do this for ten years

117
00:09:21,431 --> 00:09:24,308
because we

118
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,996
cheered each other up and
were there for each other.

119
00:09:27,021 --> 00:09:28,029
Right.

120
00:09:28,054 --> 00:09:29,929
We supported and led each other.

121
00:09:29,994 --> 00:09:32,365
But above all, My Day

122
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,971
was there for us
the entire time.

123
00:09:38,058 --> 00:09:40,018
It's true that they
led us this far.

124
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,866
The singers who met good fans.

125
00:09:41,891 --> 00:09:43,059
That's true.

126
00:09:53,604 --> 00:09:54,647
I can't hear you.

127
00:09:54,752 --> 00:09:56,336
What?

128
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:05,131
I was looking at the sun.

129
00:10:06,142 --> 00:10:07,476
Nice weather, right?

130
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:08,501
I know.

131
00:10:09,555 --> 00:10:10,555
By the way...

132
00:10:17,811 --> 00:10:18,935
Why, Dowoon?

133
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,437
The weather is nice,
and the sight is awesome.

134
00:10:22,462 --> 00:10:24,423
Why don't we sing
'You Were Beautiful'?

135
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,800
'You Were Beautiful'?

136
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,470
Why 'You Were
Beautiful' of all songs?

137
00:10:27,562 --> 00:10:31,024
When we look
back, it was beautiful.

138
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:34,434
I think it's past tense now.

139
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:35,805
It was beautiful.

140
00:10:36,267 --> 00:10:37,308
'Beautiful-ed.'

141
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,668
It's the song that
made us famous.

142
00:10:39,732 --> 00:10:42,651
A song that made us known.

143
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,353
The song that made us famous.

144
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:45,497
Yes.

145
00:10:45,522 --> 00:10:46,620
Not 'Congratulations'?

146
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:49,000
- 'Congratulations'?
- Not at that time.

147
00:10:49,025 --> 00:10:50,667
- At the time...
- 'Congratulations' is...

148
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,936
There was barely any media
coverage about us at the time.

149
00:10:52,961 --> 00:10:54,355
There was just one
article about our debut.

150
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,546
Right. There was nothing.

151
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,726
No music shows.

152
00:10:56,751 --> 00:10:58,168
I was confident about
'Congratulations.'

153
00:10:58,193 --> 00:11:01,194
It wasn't time yet.

154
00:11:02,323 --> 00:11:03,323
Let's do it.

155
00:11:03,723 --> 00:11:04,723
'You Were Beautiful'?

156
00:11:04,973 --> 00:11:05,973
Yes.

157
00:11:06,907 --> 00:11:07,907
Let's do it.

158
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:08,992
Let's do it.

159
00:11:09,017 --> 00:11:10,208
Let's do it.

160
00:11:10,235 --> 00:11:11,245
Let's do it.

161
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,104
Let's do it.

162
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:24,628
I did ask for this... but
now I'm embarrassed.

163
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,930
This was your idea!

164
00:16:31,619 --> 00:16:33,413
Guys, let's go.

165
00:16:34,472 --> 00:16:35,862
Let's go.

166
00:20:02,893 --> 00:20:05,603
Check that out.

167
00:20:05,806 --> 00:20:08,725
Doesn't it look like teeth?
Like teeth upside down, right?

168
00:20:08,914 --> 00:20:11,747
Aren't they King Kong's teeth?

169
00:20:11,867 --> 00:20:14,189
More like dinosaur's.

170
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,881
They look like teeth.

171
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:18,986
Not King Kong.
Dinosaur! You know?

172
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:20,778
Young K's talking. Looks
like King Kong's teeth.

173
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:21,987
- Dinosaur's teeth!
- A dinosaur...

174
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:23,256
Sunjin, why don’t you choose?

175
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:25,056
King Kong or dinosaur?

176
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,659
- King Kong, maybe?
- They look like King Kong?

177
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,370
More like a dinosaur's
than King Kong's, right?

178
00:20:28,371 --> 00:20:29,954
Dinosaur or King Kong?

179
00:20:29,955 --> 00:20:32,456
King Kong over a dinosaur.

180
00:20:32,457 --> 00:20:33,758
Is it a dinosaur or
King Kong? You say it.

181
00:20:33,783 --> 00:20:34,835
I’m the youngest, right?

182
00:20:34,836 --> 00:20:36,919
Not you, actually.
Let me ask Sungjin.

183
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,546
They look like a dinosaur's.

184
00:20:38,547 --> 00:20:40,423
Right?

185
00:20:40,424 --> 00:20:41,716
He takes my side.

186
00:20:41,717 --> 00:20:44,093
- But...
- Move your hand. He...

187
00:20:44,094 --> 00:20:45,357
Stay still, will you?

188
00:20:45,382 --> 00:20:47,295
Shouldn't you care about
the youngest the most?

189
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,699
- Stay put, guys.
- I was right.

190
00:20:48,724 --> 00:20:51,533
Wasn’t I the one
who got us to debut?

191
00:21:00,571 --> 00:21:01,738
Check that out.

192
00:21:01,763 --> 00:21:02,847
Look at them.

193
00:21:03,154 --> 00:21:04,466
Over there.

194
00:21:06,871 --> 00:21:07,970
Give it up for them.

195
00:21:16,688 --> 00:21:18,190
I always dreamed of that too.

196
00:21:20,734 --> 00:21:22,069
Everything that my eyes see

197
00:21:23,028 --> 00:21:24,071
becomes music.

198
00:21:25,363 --> 00:21:27,309
Everything that my eyes see

199
00:21:27,741 --> 00:21:28,909
becomes music.

200
00:21:30,827 --> 00:21:31,827
It's cool.

201
00:21:32,704 --> 00:21:34,623
I think we can…

202
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,750
- slow down.
- Okay.

203
00:21:37,751 --> 00:21:39,461
Slow down, will you?

204
00:21:40,003 --> 00:21:41,171
Or that could happen to us.

205
00:21:41,671 --> 00:21:43,047
Wait, did the car get stuck?

206
00:21:43,048 --> 00:21:44,131
Really?

207
00:21:44,132 --> 00:21:45,634
Give it more gas!

208
00:21:48,105 --> 00:21:51,601
One, two, three!

209
00:21:52,592 --> 00:21:54,465
That won't be easy.

210
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,262
Why don't we help them?

211
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,020
One, two, three!

212
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:08,597
Wait, wait.

213
00:22:09,223 --> 00:22:10,766
Give it more gas!

214
00:24:06,035 --> 00:24:07,787
Why not?

215
00:26:51,973 --> 00:26:55,994
We received so
much for what we did.

216
00:26:56,019 --> 00:26:58,021
I won't forget it until I die.

217
00:27:04,777 --> 00:27:06,279
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

218
00:27:07,363 --> 00:27:08,615
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

219
00:31:02,932 --> 00:31:05,059
It's sunny today.

220
00:31:06,144 --> 00:31:08,938
A sunny day. Look outside.

221
00:31:09,647 --> 00:31:11,357
Ta-da.

222
00:31:12,025 --> 00:31:14,485
Isn't it really sunny?

223
00:31:14,777 --> 00:31:16,153
It's a really nice day.

224
00:31:16,154 --> 00:31:17,446
Dowoon, are you filming a vlog?

225
00:31:17,447 --> 00:31:21,074
What? No. It's
just for our record.

226
00:31:21,075 --> 00:31:22,118
- For memories?
- Yes.

227
00:31:23,328 --> 00:31:24,871
Say hi.

228
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:30,960
- Sungjin.
- Yes.

229
00:31:30,961 --> 00:31:33,962
We met Sihasin yesterday.

230
00:31:33,963 --> 00:31:37,716
We met Sihasin band.

231
00:31:37,717 --> 00:31:41,678
I’ve always had that dream.

232
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:48,268
One day, I want to try
adding folk music to our sound.

233
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:50,479
And in a way,

234
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,274
we got to listen to
the original version.

235
00:31:54,275 --> 00:31:55,870
That was really inspiring.

236
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,364
It feels like we're
filming content, right?

237
00:31:59,948 --> 00:32:01,615
When I'm holding a camera,

238
00:32:01,616 --> 00:32:03,325
you never answer me.

239
00:32:03,326 --> 00:32:05,328
By the way, yesterday,

240
00:32:05,745 --> 00:32:06,829
the drums.

241
00:32:07,373 --> 00:32:10,001
- He said he made them.
- Oh, yes.

242
00:32:10,026 --> 00:32:11,262
According to the environment.

243
00:32:11,287 --> 00:32:14,913
He said he set them up
according to the environment.

244
00:32:14,938 --> 00:32:15,984
You know what was so cool?

245
00:32:16,174 --> 00:32:18,842
He steps on the
kick standing up.

246
00:32:18,867 --> 00:32:20,118
I know.

247
00:32:20,143 --> 00:32:21,391
He plays the drums standing up.

248
00:32:21,416 --> 00:32:22,750
While singing.

249
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:25,109
And I can't do that.

250
00:32:25,134 --> 00:32:26,802
You can do it.

251
00:32:26,827 --> 00:32:28,160
Don't think that's impossible.

252
00:32:28,185 --> 00:32:29,227
While watching him...

253
00:32:29,252 --> 00:32:30,252
Don't limit yourself.

254
00:32:30,277 --> 00:32:31,563
So watching him...

255
00:32:31,588 --> 00:32:33,130
Dowoon, you can do it.

256
00:32:33,155 --> 00:32:35,325
Okay. That's the end
of the conversation.

257
00:32:36,192 --> 00:32:39,361
Wonpil, I'm sorry but
that jelly looked good.

258
00:32:39,362 --> 00:32:42,281
- Do you want it?
- Can I have a bite?

259
00:32:42,282 --> 00:32:43,407
What do you want to try?

260
00:32:43,408 --> 00:32:45,368
The pink one please.

261
00:32:47,013 --> 00:32:48,013
You're picky.

262
00:32:48,038 --> 00:32:49,873
Ah.

263
00:32:50,248 --> 00:32:52,333
Isn't that Jinyoung's...

264
00:32:53,835 --> 00:32:55,252
Ah.

265
00:32:55,253 --> 00:32:57,421
No, you need to feed him.

266
00:32:57,422 --> 00:32:59,132
Ah.

267
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,011
What's wrong?

268
00:33:01,392 --> 00:33:02,392
What?

269
00:33:02,695 --> 00:33:04,071
- What's wrong?
- Something wrong?

270
00:33:04,096 --> 00:33:07,181
My phone's not working.

271
00:33:07,206 --> 00:33:08,219
What?

272
00:33:08,244 --> 00:33:11,557
- I don’t think I have reception.
- Is it the data? What is it?

273
00:33:11,582 --> 00:33:13,541
- Is the GPS not working?
- I'm getting no signals.

274
00:33:13,566 --> 00:33:14,566
Why not?

275
00:33:15,006 --> 00:33:16,882
- Who knows?
- He wouldn't know.

276
00:33:16,883 --> 00:33:18,217
Right. No one knows.

277
00:33:20,178 --> 00:33:23,306
Let's keep moving forward
until we get the reception again.

278
00:33:23,765 --> 00:33:25,058
What is this place?

279
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:26,669
What?

280
00:33:26,694 --> 00:33:27,694
Over there.

281
00:33:29,103 --> 00:33:31,397
Can you pull over?
Let's check it out.

282
00:33:52,251 --> 00:33:54,294
- What is that?
- That's interesting.

283
00:33:54,295 --> 00:33:55,337
It's pretty.

284
00:33:55,338 --> 00:33:56,464
Strange.

285
00:33:56,923 --> 00:33:59,049
- It's pretty.
- It says, 'Love is universal.'

286
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,218
What does 'universal' mean?

287
00:34:02,345 --> 00:34:04,118
Something that's
common across all regions?

288
00:34:05,348 --> 00:34:07,016
- Yeah.
- Amazing?

289
00:34:07,016 --> 00:34:08,016
Universal?

290
00:34:12,906 --> 00:34:14,427
It's nice. Do you
want to check it out?

291
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:15,762
- I want to.
- Me too.

292
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:17,389
- Let's go.
- I want to see it closely.

293
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,431
Let's go check it out.

294
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:19,683
We don't even know what it is.

295
00:34:19,684 --> 00:34:20,768
We know where it is.

296
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,605
Gosh.

297
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,857
No. It's hot.

298
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:29,067
I'll stay in the car.

299
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:30,569
This doesn't happen
often. Come on.

300
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,862
Come with us.

301
00:34:33,036 --> 00:34:35,002
- It’d be a waste not to see it.
- Do you have to?

302
00:34:35,027 --> 00:34:36,036
- Of course.
- Let's go.

303
00:34:36,237 --> 00:34:37,237
Come with us.

304
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:38,660
No. I'll stay in the car.

305
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:40,078
You guys go. Hurry.

306
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,955
Don't be so selfish.

307
00:34:41,956 --> 00:34:42,957
What can I do about it?

308
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:45,417
We'll be quick.
We won't take long.

309
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:46,418
We're off.

310
00:34:46,443 --> 00:34:47,485
- Be careful.
- Yes.

311
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:49,380
See you.

312
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:52,675
Let's go.

313
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,230
Guys, I’ll go check
it out over there too.

314
00:35:01,258 --> 00:35:03,134
Please. How far
do you want to go?

315
00:35:03,135 --> 00:35:04,344
They should be okay.

316
00:35:04,887 --> 00:35:06,638
♪ In there ♪

317
00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:36,653
This is insane!

318
00:35:36,966 --> 00:35:38,009
It got everything.

319
00:35:39,344 --> 00:35:40,762
This is basically a gym.

320
00:35:48,269 --> 00:35:49,269
What is this?

321
00:35:50,313 --> 00:35:51,314
It got everything.

322
00:35:56,736 --> 00:35:57,736
It's hot.

323
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,590
This is nice.

324
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,634
It's very nice.

325
00:37:04,129 --> 00:37:05,129
I like this place.

326
00:37:05,154 --> 00:37:06,738
Do you want to check it out?

327
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:08,684
Everything is white.

328
00:37:08,709 --> 00:37:09,791
I know.

329
00:37:09,816 --> 00:37:11,901
But it's scary white.

330
00:37:12,645 --> 00:37:14,105
Do you feel fear here?

331
00:37:20,236 --> 00:37:21,445
It's cool.

332
00:37:21,446 --> 00:37:24,699
Stuff we use in our
everyday life gathered

333
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:28,285
- to be reborn.
- Yes.

334
00:37:28,286 --> 00:37:29,745
This is pretty cool.

335
00:37:29,746 --> 00:37:31,623
How did they make all this?

336
00:37:32,457 --> 00:37:33,457
With enthusiasm.

337
00:37:34,334 --> 00:37:35,417
Right?

338
00:37:35,418 --> 00:37:36,418
Probably.

339
00:38:27,163 --> 00:38:28,663
What about Sungjin?

340
00:38:28,664 --> 00:38:31,042
We should ask
Dowoon and Sungjin.

341
00:38:42,178 --> 00:38:43,338
I think it's going to be fun.

342
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:05,909
Interesting.

343
00:39:07,453 --> 00:39:08,453
Sounds fun!

344
00:39:08,996 --> 00:39:10,289
But... where are we now?

345
00:39:31,894 --> 00:39:33,574
Kinda reminds you of
our debut days, right?

346
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:35,272
Yes.

347
00:39:36,482 --> 00:39:37,650
What do you think of first?

348
00:39:39,152 --> 00:39:43,655
When we used to
perform at clubs.

349
00:39:43,656 --> 00:39:46,032
Doesn't the stage
remind you of that?

350
00:39:46,033 --> 00:39:49,078
- Yes.
- It's exactly the same.

351
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:53,743
At the time, all the
clubs in Hongdae...

352
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:56,334
- We went to every one of them.
- I think we visited all of them.

353
00:39:56,335 --> 00:39:57,878
Almost all of them.

354
00:39:57,879 --> 00:39:59,629
- Many of them are gone now.
- Yes.

355
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,840
And one more
thing I remember is...

356
00:40:01,841 --> 00:40:04,634
When we just debuted.

357
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:07,055
- Early in our debut.
- The earliest days.

358
00:40:07,056 --> 00:40:12,059
We prepared candies with notes.

359
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:17,481
We handed them out in Hongdae,

360
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:19,275
asking people to
come just this once.

361
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,277
No one knew us back then.

362
00:40:22,278 --> 00:40:25,614
No one knew that we debuted.

363
00:40:25,615 --> 00:40:26,615
No one.

364
00:40:27,075 --> 00:40:30,035
I wanted people to recognize us.

365
00:40:30,036 --> 00:40:31,745
So on purpose,

366
00:40:31,746 --> 00:40:34,238
I carried JYP's paper bag.

367
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:35,749
The blue one?

368
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:38,006
Then people would
ask, 'What's that?'

369
00:40:38,031 --> 00:40:39,419
Because we were
giving out stuff.

370
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,254
If anyone asked, 'What's that?'

371
00:40:41,255 --> 00:40:42,632
then I said "We debuted in JYP."

372
00:40:43,496 --> 00:40:45,832
- Wanting them to recognize us.
- Right.

373
00:40:46,505 --> 00:40:48,085
We’ve gone through a lot.

374
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:54,185
Because we had those
days, we’re who we are now.

375
00:40:55,812 --> 00:40:56,812
Anyway,

376
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,565
what about Sungjin?
Is this okay without him?

377
00:41:00,566 --> 00:41:01,818
- Right.
- Right.

378
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:04,171
Shouldn't we check on him?

379
00:41:04,196 --> 00:41:05,404
What do we do?

380
00:41:05,405 --> 00:41:06,781
Is he still in the car?

381
00:41:07,051 --> 00:41:08,719
I said I'd go back soon.

382
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,840
He might get a little salty.

383
00:41:10,096 --> 00:41:13,515
I bet that there’s 90% chance,

384
00:41:13,516 --> 00:41:14,809
he's sleeping in the car.

385
00:41:15,768 --> 00:41:17,395
He looked tired.

386
00:41:18,938 --> 00:41:19,938
Is he sleeping?

387
00:41:56,952 --> 00:41:57,952
Us?

388
00:41:57,977 --> 00:41:58,977
He wants us up there.

389
00:42:01,743 --> 00:42:03,677
He's telling us to come up.

390
00:42:05,483 --> 00:42:06,601
But we're missing Sungjin.

391
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,113
What do we do?

392
00:42:10,114 --> 00:42:12,742
We need Sungjin to do anything.

393
00:42:13,785 --> 00:42:16,536
We can't do it without Sungjin.

394
00:42:16,537 --> 00:42:17,657
What's there to worry about?

395
00:42:20,124 --> 00:42:21,124
Let's do it.

396
00:42:28,007 --> 00:42:30,693
- Where were you?
- You fell asleep, right?

397
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,700
Let's go.

398
00:45:41,396 --> 00:45:43,090
We’re not here to do
great but to have fun.

399
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:44,115
One, two, three. DAY6.

400
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,349
DAY6.

401
00:45:45,374 --> 00:45:46,524
We’re not here to do
great but to have fun.

402
00:45:46,525 --> 00:45:48,402
One, two, three. DAY6.

403
00:45:48,403 --> 00:45:51,909
DAY6.

404
00:47:27,098 --> 00:47:28,933
Wow, it really is a desert.

405
00:47:30,476 --> 00:47:31,726
It's so vast.

406
00:47:31,727 --> 00:47:32,727
I know.

407
00:47:33,436 --> 00:47:34,771
I want to sled here.

408
00:47:36,147 --> 00:47:37,147
Isn't that a buggy?

409
00:47:37,842 --> 00:47:38,967
Yes.

410
00:47:38,968 --> 00:47:41,123
I only rode that in a game.

411
00:47:41,148 --> 00:47:42,559
- Want to check it out?
- Should we?

412
00:47:42,584 --> 00:47:43,972
- Let's go.
- Let's check it out.

413
00:47:43,973 --> 00:47:45,056
- Let's go.
- Check it out?

414
00:47:45,057 --> 00:47:46,099
Are you coming?

415
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,434
Go ahead.

416
00:47:47,435 --> 00:47:49,019
You saw it in a game!
Aren't you coming?

417
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:50,312
I've seen enough.

418
00:47:50,313 --> 00:47:52,148
- You want us to go check?
- Go check it out.

419
00:47:52,149 --> 00:47:53,399
- We'll be right back.
- Okay.

420
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:58,166
He's really not getting out.

421
00:47:58,708 --> 00:47:59,708
Wow.

422
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,796
Wow, it’s so cool.

423
00:48:05,298 --> 00:48:08,009
It'll be fun to drive here.

424
00:48:09,207 --> 00:48:10,620
This desert’s got a whole vibe.

425
00:48:11,137 --> 00:48:12,512
Vibe approved!

426
00:48:12,513 --> 00:48:13,765
Vibe approved!

427
00:48:14,077 --> 00:48:15,786
I've never seen a car like this.

428
00:48:15,787 --> 00:48:17,746
- It's cool how it's open.
- Cool.

429
00:48:17,747 --> 00:48:18,914
Wouldn’t it get sand in it?

430
00:48:18,915 --> 00:48:20,041
It's bigger than I thought.

431
00:48:20,587 --> 00:48:22,963
When I played PUBG,

432
00:48:22,964 --> 00:48:24,549
I thought it’d be very small.

433
00:48:25,258 --> 00:48:26,258
I know.

434
00:49:11,054 --> 00:49:13,847
But a little... a little...

435
00:49:13,848 --> 00:49:15,266
- What?
- It's a little...

436
00:49:25,443 --> 00:49:26,843
- What?
- You're going to trust him?

437
00:49:26,986 --> 00:49:28,488
Of course. We have to.

438
00:49:28,822 --> 00:49:31,448
- But...
- No plan is our plan.

439
00:49:31,449 --> 00:49:32,534
True. But...

440
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,494
- Up to you.
- Go?

441
00:49:35,495 --> 00:49:36,955
I'm going. Suit yourselves.

442
00:49:37,789 --> 00:49:38,873
Let's go.

443
00:49:39,499 --> 00:49:42,126
Let's go. Okay.

444
00:49:44,671 --> 00:49:45,755
I'm counting on you, Dave.

445
00:50:26,504 --> 00:50:27,797
Awesome.

446
00:50:30,675 --> 00:50:32,509
This is crazy.

447
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:33,510
Yeah?

448
00:50:34,052 --> 00:50:35,678
This is really crazy.

449
00:50:48,729 --> 00:50:49,729
Should we get Dowoon?

450
00:50:49,754 --> 00:50:50,754
Gosh.

451
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:54,583
Dowoon regret
it if he misses it.

452
00:50:54,608 --> 00:50:56,317
- He has to ride this.
- I know.

453
00:50:56,342 --> 00:50:58,346
- He won't know until he rides it.
- Let's ride it together.

454
00:50:58,371 --> 00:50:59,909
- You have to ride it.
- It's awesome.

455
00:50:59,913 --> 00:51:01,371
This is good enough.

456
00:51:01,372 --> 00:51:02,498
- No.
- You have to try it.

457
00:51:02,499 --> 00:51:03,999
It's worth trying once.

458
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Once in your life.

459
00:51:05,001 --> 00:51:07,294
- It's not dangerous at all.
- It seemed fun!

460
00:51:07,295 --> 00:51:10,047
Dowoon, if you miss this,

461
00:51:10,048 --> 00:51:11,840
you’re missing out on
something huge in life.

462
00:51:11,841 --> 00:51:12,841
I'm serious.

463
00:51:13,301 --> 00:51:14,427
This is huge.

464
00:51:14,835 --> 00:51:15,960
Be cool.

465
00:51:15,985 --> 00:51:16,985
Okay okay.

466
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:18,010
Come on, Dowoon.

467
00:51:18,035 --> 00:51:19,702
- Once in your life.
- Let's try it once.

468
00:51:19,727 --> 00:51:21,478
Or gonna regret it big time.

469
00:51:22,061 --> 00:51:23,270
Trust me.

470
00:51:24,545 --> 00:51:25,545
Let's go.

471
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:26,611
Ride it.

472
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:41,913
- Really?
- Okay.

473
00:51:41,914 --> 00:51:43,165
- Let's go.
- For real?

474
00:51:53,676 --> 00:51:54,801
Really?

475
00:51:54,802 --> 00:51:55,802
Let's go.

476
00:51:56,721 --> 00:51:59,097
Really? Just the four of us?

477
00:51:59,098 --> 00:52:00,098
It's so nice.

478
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:01,284
This is awesome.

479
00:52:01,309 --> 00:52:03,269
It's nice but, I
can't see anything.

480
00:52:04,812 --> 00:52:06,438
You see with your heart.

481
00:52:06,439 --> 00:52:07,772
I can't see anything.

482
00:52:07,773 --> 00:52:09,024
Watch with your heart.

483
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:10,443
This is the vibe.

484
00:52:11,652 --> 00:52:13,612
I can't believe I
get to ride a buggy.

485
00:52:14,113 --> 00:52:16,282
Sungjin driving a buggy?

486
00:52:17,533 --> 00:52:19,243
When else would we do this?

487
00:52:19,744 --> 00:52:21,162
This is going to be memorable.

488
00:55:31,603 --> 00:55:32,603
Wait.

489
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:35,355
What's wrong? Is it broken?

490
00:55:35,356 --> 00:55:36,900
I think it's out of gas.

491
00:55:37,859 --> 00:55:38,942
It's out of gas?

492
00:55:38,943 --> 00:55:39,943
Why won't it go?

493
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,778
Did he say it was full?

494
00:55:41,779 --> 00:55:43,322
Did you stop the car?

495
00:55:43,323 --> 00:55:45,992
No. I think it's broken.

496
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:47,952
Interesting.

497
00:55:49,287 --> 00:55:51,246
We need to ask Dave.

498
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:52,624
But we don't have his number.

499
00:55:59,798 --> 00:56:00,882
Where did Dave go?

500
00:56:03,051 --> 00:56:04,259
Wasn't he around?

501
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,137
Wait. Isn't that our car?

502
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:07,162
What?

503
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
No way.

504
00:56:09,001 --> 00:56:10,293
Isn't that a Tasman?

505
00:56:10,294 --> 00:56:11,294
What?

506
00:56:11,796 --> 00:56:14,507
- Is that really our car?
- Isn't that Dave?

507
00:56:15,091 --> 00:56:16,883
Wait. Did Dave just

508
00:56:16,884 --> 00:56:19,196
give us this car
that's out of gas

509
00:56:19,197 --> 00:56:20,197
and take that?

510
00:56:21,973 --> 00:56:23,307
Is there anything?

511
00:56:23,725 --> 00:56:25,226
He left his bag.

512
00:56:27,186 --> 00:56:28,228
- For real?
- Let me see.

513
00:56:28,229 --> 00:56:29,647
You're so busted.

514
00:56:30,398 --> 00:56:32,399
- What's this?
- His number might be here.

515
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,651
- Right.
- What's this?

516
00:56:34,652 --> 00:56:35,944
It's a license plate.

517
00:56:35,945 --> 00:56:37,237
These are fake.

518
00:56:37,238 --> 00:56:38,238
What?

519
00:56:38,239 --> 00:56:39,282
Fake license plates?

520
00:56:40,283 --> 00:56:41,367
What's this beanie?

521
00:56:42,378 --> 00:56:44,422
He was a scam.

522
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:48,425
He stole our car.

523
00:56:48,426 --> 00:56:49,427
Gosh.

524
00:56:51,346 --> 00:56:53,348
Do we have to walk?
This car is down.

525
00:57:06,645 --> 00:57:09,725
Young K, you told me I
would regret missing it.

526
00:57:10,467 --> 00:57:12,147
I regret riding it.

527
00:57:12,167 --> 00:57:14,100
- Dowoon.
- Okay okay, zip it!

528
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:16,313
Hey, should we try that?

529
00:57:16,314 --> 00:57:18,345
You know, like from the movie.

530
00:57:18,346 --> 00:57:20,906
Oh, Hitchhiking?
I’ve done it before!

531
00:57:21,586 --> 00:57:22,713
How should we do it?

532
00:57:23,346 --> 00:57:25,674
- The cars are going too fast.
- Let’s try it on that side.

533
00:57:25,699 --> 00:57:27,165
- Cross the road?
- Yeah.

534
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:29,979
I used to hitchhike on
trucks back in middle school.

535
00:57:30,433 --> 00:57:31,433
Let’s cross first.

536
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,080
Cross!

537
00:57:34,093 --> 00:57:35,093
Let’s cross!

538
00:57:38,395 --> 00:57:40,595
Dowoon, should
I do it like this?

539
00:57:40,908 --> 00:57:42,268
Brian, like this?

540
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:46,286
Yeap, shake it up and
down, up and down like this.

541
00:57:47,688 --> 00:57:50,088
Why is it… Ugh!

542
00:57:50,089 --> 00:57:53,001
Try it this way, like this.

543
00:57:53,014 --> 00:57:54,301
Let’s not lose our temper.

544
00:57:54,455 --> 00:57:55,561
Let’s just keep trying.

545
00:57:55,835 --> 00:57:57,381
Let’s try, it’s coming!

546
00:57:57,438 --> 00:57:59,104
Wow, we’re actually doing this?

547
01:01:02,182 --> 01:01:03,390
Is it working?

548
01:01:03,391 --> 01:01:05,476
I'm not getting any reception.

549
01:01:05,477 --> 01:01:06,477
No?

550
01:01:07,203 --> 01:01:08,997
Why am I not
getting any reception?

551
01:01:11,941 --> 01:01:13,735
Seriously.

552
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:17,029
Didn't we have a map?

553
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:18,156
You're right.

554
01:01:22,202 --> 01:01:23,368
Where are we?

555
01:01:23,369 --> 01:01:25,288
I think we're around here, no?

556
01:01:26,748 --> 01:01:29,125
38 miles?

557
01:01:30,966 --> 01:01:32,425
From where?

558
01:01:32,426 --> 01:01:33,426
Here.

559
01:01:34,011 --> 01:01:36,888
38 miles... I think I
saw it somewhere.

560
01:01:37,848 --> 01:01:39,057
What? 38 miles?

561
01:01:39,725 --> 01:01:41,392
Then Dave can't be far.

562
01:01:41,393 --> 01:01:43,270
Tasman didn't have much gas.

563
01:01:43,812 --> 01:01:44,812
Right.

564
01:01:46,648 --> 01:01:48,232
Hey. Let's go.

565
01:01:48,233 --> 01:01:49,985
We only have 38 miles left.

566
01:01:50,569 --> 01:01:52,361
Let's keep going.

567
01:01:52,362 --> 01:01:53,487
Keep it up.

568
01:01:53,488 --> 01:01:55,157
Let's go.

569
01:01:56,575 --> 01:01:57,617
Let's go.

570
01:02:08,284 --> 01:02:09,744
It's a police car!

571
01:02:12,678 --> 01:02:14,639
We're safe.

572
01:02:35,735 --> 01:02:36,736
Well done.

573
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,904
- What?
- Yes. Well done.

574
01:02:38,905 --> 01:02:40,198
Well done, everyone.

575
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:44,077
You too.

576
01:02:44,243 --> 01:02:45,244
Thanks.

577
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:47,455
Don't mind it.

578
01:02:48,623 --> 01:02:49,831
You did a good job.

579
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:51,292
We did the best we could do.

580
01:02:52,403 --> 01:02:53,403
It's fine.

581
01:02:54,648 --> 01:02:58,806
When he cheered
us up at the end,

582
01:02:58,814 --> 01:03:00,494
- that meant a lot.
- Yes.

583
01:03:00,495 --> 01:03:02,037
I almost flopped
down and slept there.

584
01:03:02,955 --> 01:03:03,955
Right.

585
01:03:04,998 --> 01:03:06,542
Gosh, that Dave guy.

586
01:03:09,336 --> 01:03:11,338
This is exactly why I
don’t leave the house.

587
01:03:12,574 --> 01:03:14,255
Nothing’s safer than
being under a blanket.

588
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,280
I know.

589
01:03:15,305 --> 01:03:18,385
I want to turn the AC
on and have tangerines.

590
01:03:18,386 --> 01:03:19,471
So good.

591
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:22,141
So sweet.

592
01:03:24,268 --> 01:03:26,714
This might become
good memories...

593
01:03:28,474 --> 01:03:29,982
One day...

594
01:03:30,209 --> 01:03:31,209
One day.

595
01:03:31,234 --> 01:03:33,901
- Maybe.
- Probably.

596
01:03:34,945 --> 01:03:35,945
Maybe.

597
01:03:35,946 --> 01:03:37,614
- Probably.
- Yes. Probably.

598
01:03:38,516 --> 01:03:42,910
♪ Ah what happy days ♪

599
01:03:42,911 --> 01:03:45,038
No. No. They weren’t happy days.

600
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:46,731
It was exhausting.

601
01:03:46,732 --> 01:03:47,957
They will be...

602
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:49,625
They will become happy days.

603
01:03:49,626 --> 01:03:50,906
Glad you guys are still smiling.

604
01:03:51,803 --> 01:03:58,093
♪ I smile ♪

605
01:03:58,969 --> 01:04:02,848
♪ I smile ♪

606
01:04:05,463 --> 01:04:06,673
Isn't that a Tasman?

607
01:04:10,397 --> 01:04:11,397
Dave?

608
01:06:59,317 --> 01:07:00,317
Nice weather.

609
01:07:01,027 --> 01:07:02,027
I know.

610
01:07:02,028 --> 01:07:03,404
It was so hot.

611
01:07:03,405 --> 01:07:04,489
It's cool here.

612
01:07:05,907 --> 01:07:06,950
It's like the opposite.

613
01:07:07,784 --> 01:07:09,410
- I know.
- Dowoon, are you cold?

614
01:07:09,411 --> 01:07:10,662
No, it's cool.

615
01:07:11,621 --> 01:07:12,789
That's life.

616
01:07:13,581 --> 01:07:14,915
Well, life’s not
always like that.

617
01:07:14,916 --> 01:07:16,876
Sometimes it's hot.
Sometimes it's cold.

618
01:07:18,002 --> 01:07:19,879
- That's the way it's been for us.
- True.

619
01:07:20,713 --> 01:07:23,590
I think it's all about enduring.

620
01:07:23,591 --> 01:07:29,889
Honestly, when I heard about
this trip, for our tenth anniversary...

621
01:07:30,849 --> 01:07:31,890
Were you anxious?

622
01:07:31,891 --> 01:07:33,934
Yes. Because it's us.

623
01:07:33,935 --> 01:07:35,018
Of course.

624
01:07:35,019 --> 01:07:36,520
Because it's us.

625
01:07:36,521 --> 01:07:39,492
Because it’s us... I was worried

626
01:07:39,493 --> 01:07:41,627
something unexpected
might happen... again.

627
01:07:43,987 --> 01:07:46,447
- Exactly as you expected, right?
- Exactly as I expected.

628
01:07:46,448 --> 01:07:47,906
- We haven’t changed a bit.
- Yes.

629
01:07:47,907 --> 01:07:49,366
Can’t help it.

630
01:07:49,367 --> 01:07:50,577
That's always DAY6.

631
01:07:51,512 --> 01:07:55,158
So much happened
in the past six days.

632
01:07:55,183 --> 01:07:56,766
- I know.
- So much happened.

633
01:07:58,126 --> 01:08:00,695
It feels like it would
be our first and last trip.

634
01:08:01,379 --> 01:08:03,089
- Right?
- Trip abroad?

635
01:08:03,090 --> 01:08:06,550
This will be our first and
last tenth anniversary trip.

636
01:08:06,551 --> 01:08:08,511
- Yes.
- It will never come back.

637
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,370
Who knows? Maybe
another one this winter.

638
01:08:11,371 --> 01:08:13,748
He means we won’t have
another tenth anniversary.

639
01:08:15,583 --> 01:08:18,135
You carried a lot
on your shoulder…

640
01:08:18,136 --> 01:08:21,417
As our leader, you
always plan the trip for us.

641
01:08:21,418 --> 01:08:23,757
- But what happened this time?
- I know...

642
01:08:23,758 --> 01:08:24,841
He has a plan,

643
01:08:24,842 --> 01:08:27,886
but he also has bad
luck that ruins his plan.

644
01:08:27,887 --> 01:08:29,806
- And that's me.
- Congratulations.

645
01:08:29,807 --> 01:08:31,140
Thank you, always.

646
01:08:31,933 --> 01:08:32,933
I owe you.

647
01:08:33,685 --> 01:08:35,603
You’re the reason why
DAY6 is so dynamic.

648
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:38,438
- My life has been like this.
- I knew it.

649
01:08:38,439 --> 01:08:39,446
Really, thank you.

650
01:08:39,447 --> 01:08:41,442
- For this trip, and everything else.
- Right.

651
01:08:41,443 --> 01:08:42,693
Every time.

652
01:08:42,694 --> 01:08:44,111
For the whole ten years.

653
01:08:44,112 --> 01:08:47,447
Yes. Both you and Wonpil.

654
01:08:47,448 --> 01:08:48,950
- Right. Went through a lot.
- I...

655
01:08:49,283 --> 01:08:50,534
Right. Everyone worked hard.

656
01:08:50,535 --> 01:08:51,577
I... I'm actually...

657
01:08:52,537 --> 01:08:55,706
You're always doing
great just by being there.

658
01:08:55,707 --> 01:08:57,416
My existence alone is great.

659
01:08:57,417 --> 01:08:58,458
Yes. Your existence alone.

660
01:08:58,459 --> 01:09:00,377
I'm the lucky
charm of this team!

661
01:09:00,378 --> 01:09:02,379
- Right.
- You're handsome.

662
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:04,090
I'm not so bad.

663
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:10,137
When I have a
hard time or struggle,

664
01:09:10,138 --> 01:09:11,556
I think about them.

665
01:09:12,807 --> 01:09:14,058
- My Day?
- Yes.

666
01:09:15,310 --> 01:09:16,310
Yes.

667
01:09:16,311 --> 01:09:17,810
They cheer us up.

668
01:09:17,811 --> 01:09:18,812
Of course.

669
01:09:18,813 --> 01:09:20,188
Without My Day,

670
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:23,735
not to mention our ten years...

671
01:09:25,278 --> 01:09:27,918
They keep DAY6 moving
forward. Our true driving force.

672
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:30,991
The fact that
we're on this sand.

673
01:09:30,992 --> 01:09:33,229
- We owe it all to My Day.
- Yes.

674
01:09:33,664 --> 01:09:34,664
To be honest,

675
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:39,842
My Day have waited
a long time for us.

676
01:09:39,867 --> 01:09:40,867
Yes.

677
01:09:40,878 --> 01:09:43,837
When they were waiting for us,

678
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:48,509
they continued to send us love.

679
01:09:49,763 --> 01:09:53,434
We wanted to make up for that,

680
01:09:53,931 --> 01:09:55,849
so after we completed
our military service,

681
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:59,394
we got back together.

682
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:02,273
And we did our best
to return their love.

683
01:10:03,316 --> 01:10:05,317
If you think about
our beginning,

684
01:10:05,318 --> 01:10:09,488
My Day basically created
our concert culture.

685
01:10:09,489 --> 01:10:14,993
Even when we were completely
lost or stunned on stage,

686
01:10:14,994 --> 01:10:17,871
They were the ones
pulling us forward.

687
01:10:17,872 --> 01:10:18,872
Of course.

688
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:23,335
It's already been ten years

689
01:10:23,336 --> 01:10:25,672
for that young DAY6.

690
01:10:25,911 --> 01:10:27,287
Look at us now.

691
01:10:28,105 --> 01:10:29,838
Oh, ten years.

692
01:10:30,551 --> 01:10:32,431
What would we look like
on our 20th anniversary?

693
01:10:32,637 --> 01:10:34,554
- Ten years later?
- Yes.

694
01:10:36,182 --> 01:10:38,142
We'd still be the same.

695
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:40,560
One thing is clear.

696
01:10:40,561 --> 01:10:43,147
We won't be able to

697
01:10:43,815 --> 01:10:46,650
perform as much as now.

698
01:10:46,651 --> 01:10:48,236
Yeah, not as active
as we are now.

699
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:52,280
First of all, we
must stay healthy.

700
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:55,284
For us to perform a lot, we
must take care of ourselves.

701
01:10:55,452 --> 01:10:57,343
I already feel different
from ten years ago.

702
01:10:57,368 --> 01:10:58,371
I know.

703
01:10:58,372 --> 01:11:00,747
It's so different.
So different...

704
01:11:00,748 --> 01:11:02,333
I feel it when I perform.

705
01:11:02,959 --> 01:11:04,127
- Dowoon.
- Yes.

706
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:07,504
Do you look forward to
where we’ll be in ten years?

707
01:11:07,505 --> 01:11:08,505
Of course.

708
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,280
Yes.

709
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:11,634
- I think.
- Yes?

710
01:11:12,593 --> 01:11:14,428
there won't be much difference.

711
01:11:14,429 --> 01:11:16,149
Wait. That means
I'm not excited.

712
01:11:16,259 --> 01:11:18,635
No. That means that's
how you want it to be.

713
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:19,660
Yeah?

714
01:11:19,685 --> 01:11:22,769
To me, being ordinary is
the hardest thing to pull off.

715
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:24,814
Right. But we're not ordinary.

716
01:11:25,148 --> 01:11:26,356
That's also true.

717
01:11:26,357 --> 01:11:28,567
Who cares about
ten years from now?

718
01:11:28,568 --> 01:11:30,610
We don't even know
what we're doing tomorrow.

719
01:11:30,611 --> 01:11:31,862
So what are we doing tomorrow?

720
01:11:31,863 --> 01:11:35,158
You never know
what'll happen tomorrow.

721
01:11:36,075 --> 01:11:37,535
Where are we going right now?

722
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:40,078
Just where this road leads.

723
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:41,496
Where are we going?

724
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:43,582
To the end over there.

725
01:11:43,583 --> 01:11:44,583
Sure.

726
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:47,462
If we just keep walking...
the earth is round.

727
01:11:48,129 --> 01:11:49,713
Oh, we will get to
Korea eventually?

728
01:11:49,714 --> 01:11:50,797
We'll get somewhere.

729
01:11:50,798 --> 01:11:51,840
We'll get somewhere.

730
01:11:51,841 --> 01:11:52,841
Of course.

731
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:56,804
When tomorrow comes,
maybe it’ll be better than today.

732
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,310
- Let's keep going.
- Yes. Let's go.

733
01:12:02,311 --> 01:12:03,477
Let's go.

734
01:12:03,478 --> 01:12:04,479
Let's just go.

735
01:12:05,271 --> 01:12:06,563
That's what we've been doing.

736
01:12:06,564 --> 01:12:08,816
♪ That’s how it was ♪

737
01:12:14,447 --> 01:12:15,698
Catch me if you can.

738
01:12:16,407 --> 01:12:17,407
Catch me.

739
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:19,702
I'm running.

740
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
We don't do that.

741
01:16:48,596 --> 01:16:49,596
Nice.

742
01:16:55,954 --> 01:16:57,801
Guys, thank you so much.

743
01:16:58,662 --> 01:17:00,154
Dowoon, out of nowhere?

744
01:17:00,602 --> 01:17:04,101
Without you, I wouldn't
have endured it for ten years.

745
01:17:04,321 --> 01:17:06,688
Same here! Thank
you so much, everyone.

746
01:17:07,664 --> 01:17:09,540
Ready to run for
the 20th anniversary?

747
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:12,000
- Totally.
- Let's continue to do this.

748
01:17:12,001 --> 01:17:13,795
Where's our next
stage going to be?

749
01:17:29,485 --> 01:17:33,044
You two look good on camera.

750
01:18:52,129 --> 01:18:53,309
No, it's really hard!

751
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:58,416
What I did yesterday
wasn’t even driving.

752
01:19:00,803 --> 01:19:04,453
Lost count of how many
times we tried hitchhiking…

753
01:19:07,154 --> 01:19:08,154
Rock, paper, scissors.

754
01:19:10,647 --> 01:19:13,239
- Sungjin might be sleeping in the car...
- Sounds true.

755
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:15,960
Or eating somewhere near.

756
01:19:24,204 --> 01:19:27,957
- Can you do ‘Bravo’ this time?
- 'Bravo'.

757
01:19:55,504 --> 01:19:58,549
Wow, talk about
next-level tuning.

758
01:19:58,583 --> 01:20:00,603
All bright and bubbly!

759
01:20:03,458 --> 01:20:05,671
Big round of applause!
Thank you, thank you!

760
01:20:05,696 --> 01:20:08,083
Thank you so much, everyone!
