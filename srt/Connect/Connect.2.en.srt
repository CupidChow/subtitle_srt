1
00:01:43,491 --> 00:01:45,368
The crow came back again.

2
00:01:47,412 --> 00:01:48,496
Stop it!

3
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,664
Ah!

4
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,793
Are you okay?

5
00:02:35,961 --> 00:02:37,254
Monster...

6
00:02:42,676 --> 00:02:43,802
Monster.

7
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,263
He's a monster.

8
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:52,143
Mo... monster.

9
00:02:53,144 --> 00:02:54,854
I'm not!

10
00:04:41,878 --> 00:04:42,712
Damn it.

11
00:04:45,256 --> 00:04:46,800
Feels great to be out of there.

12
00:04:46,883 --> 00:04:49,135
I was so annoyed earlier.
It wasn't obvious, was it?

13
00:05:02,148 --> 00:05:03,233
Ah.

14
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:07,570
Oh, my God, what was that?
That was so creepy. Did you see his eye?

15
00:05:09,906 --> 00:05:10,740
Let's go.

16
00:05:12,617 --> 00:05:14,077
-Excuse me.
-So creepy.

17
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,703
Oh, he's coming, he's coming, he's coming.

18
00:05:15,787 --> 00:05:17,497
Uh, excuse me, just a moment.

19
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,960
I would like to ask you something.

20
00:05:22,293 --> 00:05:23,378
What?

21
00:05:24,546 --> 00:05:31,052
Um, you were in this area
with a man before, right?

22
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,434
Oh, it doesn't have anything
to do with you.

23
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:39,644
-Uh, we're kind of busy.
-Seriously, what the hell?

24
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:42,313
Oh, I mean, I'm not a weird person...

25
00:06:06,463 --> 00:06:08,548
OH JINSEOP

26
00:06:17,098 --> 00:06:18,766
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

27
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,062
More side dishes please!

28
00:06:51,257 --> 00:06:53,134
So what happened?

29
00:06:53,593 --> 00:06:55,803
Oh, we got picked on by a pervert.

30
00:06:56,513 --> 00:07:00,225
So the man with an eye patch
came after you specifically, Sunhee?

31
00:07:00,308 --> 00:07:02,310
Well, I don't know, it was really
annoying.

32
00:07:03,811 --> 00:07:04,938
Huh?

33
00:07:06,314 --> 00:07:08,358
What are the odds of seeing Jinseop
at a place like this?

34
00:07:08,441 --> 00:07:11,319
Yeah, right. He always eats alone.
I wonder why he's eating here...

35
00:07:11,861 --> 00:07:15,740
Maybe he wants to hang out
with people like us sometimes.

36
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:19,994
Um, can we sit with you?

37
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,209
Sure, why not?

38
00:07:30,672 --> 00:07:32,048
Thank you.

you were looking for a jingle
for the Nister commercial, right?

46

Yeah.

47
00:08:24,934 --> 00:08:26,644
That song you just heard,

48
00:08:26,728 --> 00:08:28,730
there's a rumor
that Z will be covering it.

49
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:30,773
What do you think?

50
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:33,735

00:09:21,157 --> 00:09:23,951
Jinseop, what do you think of Sunhee?

56
00:09:27,246 --> 00:09:29,666
Sunhee seems to have feelings for you.

57
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:34,128
What are you trying to say?

58
00:09:35,797 --> 00:09:41,386
Well, you see, I'm interested in Sunhee
and I'd like to try asking her out.

59
00:09:41,469 --> 00:09:45,473
I wanted to know if that's okay with you.

60
00:09:45,556 --> 00:09:46,766
It's okay.

61
00:09:46,849 --> 00:09:47,975
What?

62
00:09:49,977 --> 00:09:51,145
Really?

63
00:09:52,814 --> 00:09:56,442
Good luck, I'm heading out.

00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,821

NAMSAN HOUSE, ORIGINAL SUNDAE SOUP

66
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,374
I'm sorry.

67
00:10:15,712 --> 00:10:17,088
Where's Jinseop?

68
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:19,799
Ah, he said he was leaving first.

69
00:10:19,882 --> 00:10:20,925
Huh?

70
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:23,511
But why...

71
00:10:24,137 --> 00:10:26,222
The eye-patch man.

72
00:10:26,848 --> 00:10:28,891
He followed us in here, what do we do?

73
00:10:29,892 --> 00:10:31,310
Oh, no...

74
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:46,993
-Excuse me, can I...
-Who the hell are you?

75
00:10:50,413 --> 00:10:54,751
No, I'm just... I'm looking for someone.

76
00:10:55,793 --> 00:10:59,172
I'm sorry, but who exactly
are you looking for?

77
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,009
Wasn't there another person sitting here?

78
00:11:03,676 --> 00:11:07,180
There's no one, you bastard,
why are you asking about that?

79
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:09,724
Perhaps your boyfriend?

80
00:11:12,477 --> 00:11:14,395
I don't have a boyfriend.

81
00:11:16,105 --> 00:11:19,442
You-you better get lost
before I call the cops.

82

OFFICIAL_Z: GREAT SONG.
COULD I CONTACT YOU THROUGH DM?

LONELY GUITAR MAN: I'M SORRY.
I DON'T USE DM FOR PERSONAL REASONS.

84
00:11:38,294 --> 00:11:42,507
THIS SONG IS AVAILABLE FOR ANYONE TO USE,
SO FEEL FREE TO USE IT HOWEVER YOU WANT.

85
00:11:44,425 --> 00:11:45,259
Z.

86
00:11:46,093 --> 00:11:48,262
He may think that
you didn't comment this yourself.

87
00:11:49,138 --> 00:11:51,182
Then I'll just hurry and record it.

88
00:11:52,308 --> 00:11:54,101
Once they listen to the complete version,

89
00:11:54,185 --> 00:11:58,648
everyone would think that it's my song
and that I wrote it myself.

90
00:11:58,731 --> 00:12:01,943
What if you run into
problems after recording?

91
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:07,490
He said it's not copyrighted.
Others might claim it first.

92
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:11,869
You're right, there's someone
who already arranged and posted it.

93
00:12:11,953 --> 00:12:13,120
Huh?

94
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,560
I don't see it.

95
00:13:20,313 --> 00:13:23,232
Why do I see it then not see it randomly?

96
00:13:40,207 --> 00:13:42,877
Looks like there's not much progress
in the investigation.

97
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:10,029
Then first, I'll check
the horoscope for your date of birth.

98
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:16,494
Tell me your birthday.

99
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:20,039
Well...

100
00:14:21,457 --> 00:14:25,711
It's not the horoscope I want.
I came to ask a question.

101
00:14:27,171 --> 00:14:28,589
Please go ahead.

102
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,472
Um, what do all of those mean?

103
00:14:36,555 --> 00:14:38,641
They are symbols of the
planets in the solar system.

104
00:14:40,434 --> 00:14:41,435
Ah...

105
00:14:56,575 --> 00:14:59,370
Then what about this?

106
00:15:00,121 --> 00:15:01,706
That is Pluto.

107
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:04,041
Pluto...

108
00:15:05,626 --> 00:15:12,591
Then could Pluto, November 29th,
and December 12th,

109
00:15:12,675 --> 00:15:16,178
be linked in any way based on astrology?

110
00:15:21,308 --> 00:15:26,272
Both dates are days
when Pluto and Venus make a conjunction.

111
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:30,818
Conjunction?

112
00:15:32,653 --> 00:15:35,823
Okay, this is Pluto and this is Venus.

113
00:15:36,615 --> 00:15:40,661
Can you see that both planets' symbols
are inside the same boundary?

114
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,791
Multiple planets gathered to form angles

115
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:50,546
within the same boundary
are called "conjunction."

116
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:56,886
What's all this?

117
00:15:58,637 --> 00:16:01,974
Each star symbolizes different meanings.

118
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:06,228
If Venus is a symbol of beauty and art,

119
00:16:06,312 --> 00:16:10,232
then Pluto symbolizes destruction
and regeneration.

120
00:16:10,941 --> 00:16:15,946
The King of the Underworld,
sometimes called the Grim Reaper.

121
00:16:16,989 --> 00:16:21,660
In other words, it could be a cycle
of death and art.

122
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:32,505
Then when would that conjunction
take place again?

123
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:35,966
It's not a common occurrence.

124
00:16:40,429 --> 00:16:43,432
December 20th, and then...

125
00:16:46,018 --> 00:16:47,520
December 25th.

126
00:16:48,604 --> 00:16:50,231
On Christmas too?

127
00:16:52,316 --> 00:16:55,111
When the orb hits zero,
December 12th and December 25th

128
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:58,906
are placed at the center of conjunction,

129
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,367
and the cycle goes into retrograde.

130
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,452
When the conjunction begins again,

131
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:12,461
it ends on January 6th.

132
00:18:02,553 --> 00:18:04,305
How did you know where I live?

133
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,352
I know everything about you, Jinseop.

134
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:20,070
What do you know about me?

135
00:18:22,823 --> 00:18:29,538
Could you try to get to know me first?

136
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,046
If you just tell me to go away...

137
00:18:41,425 --> 00:18:43,510
Come in, for now.

138
00:19:01,487 --> 00:19:04,990
It looks cleaner than a model house.

139
00:19:12,498 --> 00:19:14,583
Do you want to get yourself clean too?

140
00:19:18,087 --> 00:19:20,130
You said you wanted to show me everything.

141
00:20:03,132 --> 00:20:04,675
RELIABLE POLICE, SAFE COUNTRY
NAMBU POLICE STATION

142
00:20:04,758 --> 00:20:07,136
Oh, Youngran, what's up?

143
00:20:08,262 --> 00:20:09,346
What?

144
00:20:11,473 --> 00:20:12,641
And then?

145
00:20:14,893 --> 00:20:15,936
Yeah.

146
00:20:17,563 --> 00:20:18,897
You want me to come over there?

147
00:20:20,649 --> 00:20:21,942
Ah, you'll come over?

148
00:20:22,526 --> 00:20:23,777
How long will it take?

149
00:20:38,876 --> 00:20:40,711
Oh. It was the symbol for Pluto.

150
00:20:40,794 --> 00:20:42,880
That's right, symbol for Pluto.

151
00:20:43,756 --> 00:20:45,758
Actually, the meaning
behind constellations or stars

152
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:49,094
are interpreted differently depending
on the country.

153
00:20:50,095 --> 00:20:55,184
In a Christian viewpoint,
Venus is interpreted as Lúcĭfer.

154
00:20:56,018 --> 00:20:57,895
-Known as Lucifer.
-What?

155
00:20:58,729 --> 00:20:59,897
The devil?

156
00:21:05,694 --> 00:21:07,488
That's right, the devil.

157
00:21:07,988 --> 00:21:09,990
Also called the fallen angel.

158
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:17,206
The devil. Fallen angel.

159
00:21:17,706 --> 00:21:22,252
Okay, fine, but how did that young man

160
00:21:22,336 --> 00:21:27,007
find out about the date of the murder

161
00:21:27,091 --> 00:21:30,219
and its connection to astrology?

162
00:21:30,302 --> 00:21:34,348
This...
This Pluto symbol, it's classified.

163
00:21:34,431 --> 00:21:35,432
Classified?

164
00:21:35,516 --> 00:21:36,558
Yeah.

165
00:21:39,061 --> 00:21:42,022
I did tell him about the calculation

166
00:21:42,106 --> 00:21:46,944
for the dates of conjunction occurrence.

167
00:21:47,027 --> 00:21:49,571
What does he look like?
His characteristics?

168
00:21:51,532 --> 00:21:52,950
-Firstly...
-Yeah.

169
00:21:53,409 --> 00:21:55,285
-He's good-looking.
-Hey, Gye Youngran, damn it...

170
00:21:55,369 --> 00:21:57,246
Okay, okay.

171
00:21:59,623 --> 00:22:00,791
Eye patch.

172
00:22:03,085 --> 00:22:04,002
Eye patch?

173
00:22:04,086 --> 00:22:05,587
He had an eye patch on his right eye.

174
00:22:05,671 --> 00:22:07,756
-Hey, give me that thing, hurry up.
-Yes, sir.

175
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,049
Come on.

176
00:22:15,889 --> 00:22:17,099
Mm, handsome.

177
00:22:17,182 --> 00:22:18,100
Hey, come on!

178
00:22:18,183 --> 00:22:19,435
It's him, this man.

179
00:22:19,518 --> 00:22:21,395
Hey, put this guy on the suspects list,

180
00:22:21,478 --> 00:22:24,064
and, uh, check all CCTV footage

181
00:22:24,148 --> 00:22:28,694
within two kilometer radius,
and trace his movements.

182
00:22:28,777 --> 00:22:30,070
Yes, sir.

183
00:22:35,451 --> 00:22:37,202
Is that guy really the culprit?

184
00:22:37,286 --> 00:22:39,246
Not yet. Well, I don't know yet.

185
00:22:39,997 --> 00:22:42,374
Hey, thanks for your help.

186
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:43,750
Treat me to a meal.

187
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:44,960
Okay, got it.

188
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,340
-Let's go eat.
-Yeah.

189
00:23:10,819 --> 00:23:12,738
How can it be so perfectly organized...

190
00:24:47,749 --> 00:24:49,042
Found him!

191
00:24:49,126 --> 00:24:51,169
Here, the eye patch, the eye patch.

192
00:24:54,172 --> 00:24:58,802
What? This is that psychopath?

193
00:25:03,849 --> 00:25:04,850
Play it again.

194
00:25:53,106 --> 00:25:57,152
Oh, oh, oh, hey, hey, hey,
where are you going?

195
00:25:57,235 --> 00:26:00,864
Come here, huh? Come here!

196
00:26:00,947 --> 00:26:04,242
Hey you little runt, come here.
Oh, my goodness.

197
00:26:04,326 --> 00:26:06,912
Huh? Oh my, hey, where are you going?

198
00:26:06,995 --> 00:26:12,584
Hey, Pipi, what are you barking at?
What is it, huh? What's wrong?

199
00:26:42,989 --> 00:26:46,743
FOURTH CORPSE ART FOUND

200
00:26:46,827 --> 00:26:50,163
IN HANYUL PARK AT 7:40 A.M. TODAY

201
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:55,460
FOURTH

202
00:26:57,754 --> 00:26:59,339
FOURTH CORPSE ART FOUND ON DECEMBER 25TH…

203
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:53,852
It's really in that order of dates?

204
00:27:54,269 --> 00:27:58,190
Then the next would be January 6th, and
there's only about ten days left.

205
00:27:58,273 --> 00:28:01,359
Come on, do you believe that? Damn it.

206
00:28:01,443 --> 00:28:03,111
We'll catch him somehow before it happens.

207
00:28:27,886 --> 00:28:29,805
-Out of the way!
-What is it?

208
00:28:34,893 --> 00:28:37,145
-Oh, hey, that, that, that bastard.
-Get that bastard first!

209
00:28:37,229 --> 00:28:38,146
Hey.

210
00:28:52,452 --> 00:28:55,789
Sunhee, is something wrong?

211
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,291
Where is Jinseop?

212
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,045
I don't think he's come in yet.

213
00:29:02,128 --> 00:29:03,588
Shouldn't he be in soon?

214
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:06,675
I was hoping you could help me.

215
00:29:08,635 --> 00:29:10,595
What can I help you with?

216
00:29:28,363 --> 00:29:29,990
Go this way.

217
00:29:36,246 --> 00:29:40,000
Come here, come here, you bastard.

218
00:29:48,383 --> 00:29:49,467
-Ah, damn it.
-Hey!

219
00:29:51,845 --> 00:29:53,680
This bastard.

220
00:29:53,763 --> 00:29:56,850
Come here, you bastard!

221
00:30:20,206 --> 00:30:23,084
Hey, what are you doing?

222
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,402
Ew, this is gross.

223
00:30:51,321 --> 00:30:54,824
Hey, hurry up
and put this back on yourself.

224
00:30:56,534 --> 00:31:01,373
Why... why are you doing this to me?

225
00:31:02,624 --> 00:31:04,584
That's none of your business.

226
00:31:28,817 --> 00:31:32,278
That's amazing, Connect.

227
00:31:34,447 --> 00:31:36,366
Co... connect?

228
00:31:41,371 --> 00:31:42,789
What do you want to do?

229
00:31:43,415 --> 00:31:46,710
If you want to keep this a secret,
you'd better kill him now.

230
00:31:47,794 --> 00:31:49,504
Ki... kill him?

231
00:31:54,175 --> 00:31:56,428
The cops will be here soon.

232
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,684
If you want to kill him, you must hurry.

233
00:32:12,777 --> 00:32:15,196
Stop right there, you son of a bitch!

234
00:32:17,741 --> 00:32:19,701
Ugh...

235
00:32:19,784 --> 00:32:21,578
Hey, who were you chasing, huh?

236
00:32:23,163 --> 00:32:26,082
I was just jogging,
what are you talking about?

237
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:27,208
Ugh...

238
00:32:47,604 --> 00:32:51,941
You, you weren't with them?

239
00:32:56,654 --> 00:33:01,242
I figured they would lead me
to you, so I followed them.

240
00:33:03,453 --> 00:33:09,751
He called me Connect.
Was that what you wanted to check?

241
00:33:11,878 --> 00:33:15,507
At least, I don't think of you
as some bundle of money.

242
00:33:16,925 --> 00:33:18,176
Bundle of money?

243
00:33:19,511 --> 00:33:21,179
What do you know about Connect?

244
00:33:23,014 --> 00:33:24,724
It's kind of a long story...

245
00:33:25,266 --> 00:33:26,518
Do you have a phone?

246
00:33:31,731 --> 00:33:34,067
What are you... Give it back, now.

247
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,985
I'm making it too easy. No fun.

248
00:33:44,744 --> 00:33:47,413
I'm Choi Irang. Save my number.

249
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,878
If you don't call,
I will. What's your name?

250
00:33:54,462 --> 00:33:55,755
You don't need to know.

251
00:33:58,508 --> 00:34:01,344
I think you should hide out here
for a bit longer.

252
00:34:01,427 --> 00:34:03,555
If you want to stay here,
then you can do that.

253
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:25,118
Hi, I want to talk to you alone.

254
00:34:35,712 --> 00:34:37,255
It will be quick.

255
00:35:04,532 --> 00:35:09,204
I saw something at your place
when I came over.

256
00:35:09,954 --> 00:35:12,207
The sketch book.

257
00:35:12,957 --> 00:35:14,209
Ah...

258
00:35:14,751 --> 00:35:17,378
There were things like
corpse art drawings.

259
00:35:18,338 --> 00:35:21,090
Surprisingly well-drawn...

260
00:35:21,674 --> 00:35:24,219
Aren't those drawings popular online
for being artistic?

261
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,804
I was just copying them.

262
00:35:26,888 --> 00:35:31,559
Then what about the drawing
of this morning's murder?

263
00:35:31,643 --> 00:35:34,020
Where'd you find that?

264
00:35:35,939 --> 00:35:38,608
It seemed like you drew it
before the murder even happened.

265
00:35:42,487 --> 00:35:45,573
I also saw the drawing on the last page.

266
00:35:46,699 --> 00:35:50,411
What are all those?

267
00:35:51,246 --> 00:35:54,457
You saw them all?

268
00:36:05,301 --> 00:36:07,262
Man, where did everyone go?

269
00:36:07,971 --> 00:36:10,640
Ah, I'll try calling Sunhee.

270
00:36:13,226 --> 00:36:16,020
Well, Jinseop, I'm just…

271
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,731
I don't really know what's going on,

272
00:36:19,941 --> 00:36:21,484
but Sunhee asked me to…

273
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:23,528
No, Myunghoon.

274
00:36:23,611 --> 00:36:27,323
This man, this guy is...

275
00:36:30,368 --> 00:36:32,495
He... he's a murderer.
