1
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,482
DOLCHI

2
00:00:58,697 --> 00:01:00,991
Yeah, did you find her?

3
00:01:01,074 --> 00:01:02,534
Yes.

4
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,796
Stay close to her
and learn everything you can.

5
00:01:17,257 --> 00:01:19,467
Where they're based,

6
00:01:20,135 --> 00:01:24,306
if they live as a group
or mooch off of someone,

7
00:01:24,389 --> 00:01:26,308
how many there are.

8
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:51,875
BOSS 2

9
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,006
Ugh, so annoying...

10
00:02:05,138 --> 00:02:06,640
I heard you found her.

11
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:10,477
Separated from the eyeball
and currently alone.

12
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:15,774
She hasn't left Seohan City yet.

13
00:02:16,316 --> 00:02:19,569
Ugh, they were right under our noses

14
00:02:19,653 --> 00:02:23,114
and we let them go like idiots, oh, man...

15
00:02:23,865 --> 00:02:27,911
We'll keep this between us...

16
00:02:29,955 --> 00:02:32,082
I won't report to the higher-ups.

17
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:35,710
Oh, of course, we worked
so hard for that information.

18
00:02:40,882 --> 00:02:43,677
Yeah, with the eye patch,
it's gotta be Ha Dongsoo.

19
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:46,554
That little…

20
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:52,018
I mean, he could jump from the rooftop,
this is nothing for him! Damn it.

21
00:02:54,271 --> 00:02:55,897
He's certainly different.

22
00:02:56,022 --> 00:02:56,898
Right?

23
00:02:59,317 --> 00:03:04,614
Why did Oh Jinseop
pretend to be Ha Dongsoo?

24
00:03:06,574 --> 00:03:07,492
Sir?

25
00:03:07,575 --> 00:03:09,995
To pin the murder charge on him?

26
00:03:10,578 --> 00:03:14,708
Or is it something else?

27
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,922
You mean, this... this...
this is O... Oh Jinseop?

28
00:03:21,715 --> 00:03:23,425
I know how this ends.

29
00:03:26,678 --> 00:03:29,889
Go arrest Oh Jinseop, right now.

30
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:43,153
Wake up! Gideun!

31
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,878
Pack your things, too.

32
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:01,713
Starting tomorrow,

33
00:04:01,796 --> 00:04:08,053
we'll have a better place
to eat and sleep in than this hole.

34
00:04:09,763 --> 00:04:13,099
From now on, we'll crush anyone...

35
00:04:14,768 --> 00:04:17,479
who tries to take advantage of our power.

36
00:04:54,015 --> 00:04:57,685
What are you looking at?

37
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:11,991
You see what beauty could come
from using the human body as a medium?

38
00:05:12,075 --> 00:05:15,912
You should recognize
that surgeon from before.

39
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,581
Organ trafficking gang...

40
00:05:22,043 --> 00:05:23,503
Where is Z?

41
00:05:24,337 --> 00:05:26,965
What would you do if you knew?
Would you help him?

42
00:05:27,048 --> 00:05:29,676
Stop getting innocent people involved.

43
00:05:38,101 --> 00:05:39,727
We're polar opposites.

44
00:05:40,854 --> 00:05:43,690
I wanted to ascend into a plane
of eternal beauty

45
00:05:43,773 --> 00:05:47,652
despite being born
into a life of insignificance.

46
00:05:47,735 --> 00:05:51,197
You were born outside a world
that doesn't want you,

47
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:53,867
but you still so desperately wanted
to become a part of it.

48
00:05:56,453 --> 00:05:58,413
I create art,

49
00:06:00,707 --> 00:06:02,208
and you sing,

50
00:06:04,127 --> 00:06:07,172
and the two of us
met through eye transplant.

51
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,261
Doesn't this conjunction
of fate feel beautiful?

52
00:06:15,263 --> 00:06:19,642
Oh, wait, maybe for you it's repulsive?

53
00:06:21,227 --> 00:06:22,353
Isn't it obvious?

54
00:06:22,437 --> 00:06:23,897
Well, be that as it may.

55
00:06:24,397 --> 00:06:28,109
In the eyes of the world,
you and I are both treated like monsters.

56
00:06:36,534 --> 00:06:38,328
The same but complete opposites.

57
00:06:39,704 --> 00:06:43,374
That relationship itself creates newness.

58
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:49,964
Whether that is beauty
or something more fundamental.

59
00:06:51,883 --> 00:06:55,803
Light and shadow, negative and positive,
man and woman.

60
00:06:55,887 --> 00:06:58,473
If things far apart can be linked

61
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:02,977
as one...

62
00:07:06,064 --> 00:07:10,235
How about it? Would you like
to live with me as one?

63
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:12,946
What?

64
00:07:18,284 --> 00:07:22,997
We become one,
by attaching my head to your body.

65
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:27,752
You sick bastard.

66
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,256
Where's Z?

67
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,178
I... I came as promised,

68
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,515
bring me Z.

69
00:07:43,351 --> 00:07:47,438
You leave me no choice.
I must start the experiment.

70
00:07:49,607 --> 00:07:51,067
Experiment?

71
00:08:05,832 --> 00:08:07,792
Mr. Z, I'm sorry,

72
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,922
because of me you're...

73
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:16,509
Who...

74
00:08:17,844 --> 00:08:20,346
Oh, I am, uh...

75
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,476
I'm Guitar Man.

76
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,186
Lonely Guitar Man.

77
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,438
Shut up.

78
00:08:32,483 --> 00:08:33,901
Guitar Man?

79
00:08:35,236 --> 00:08:38,323
Oh, I'm really sorry,

80
00:08:39,324 --> 00:08:41,784
you were kidnapped to lure me here.

81
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:47,874
What do you mean?

82
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,335
So…

83
00:08:52,003 --> 00:08:53,421
How do I start?

84
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,553
That bastard is the corpse art killer.

85
00:09:01,137 --> 00:09:04,140
The corpse art murder case?

86
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,396
Yes. I've been keeping track
of his crimes so far, and, uh...

87
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:12,940
A detective?

88
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:16,235
Oh, no, I, I'm actually not...

89
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:19,530
Oh, Guitar Man.

90
00:09:20,198 --> 00:09:25,995
Yes. Uh, you covered my song.

91
00:09:26,746 --> 00:09:30,375
It was an honor, really, and, uh...

92
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,335
You seriously suck at explaining.

93
00:09:36,756 --> 00:09:38,007
Wh... what are you doing?

94
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,144
This is it, right here.
The reason Guitar Man is lonely.

95
00:09:54,357 --> 00:09:59,821
You're probably thinking,
"What in the world is this?" Yes?

96
00:09:59,904 --> 00:10:02,031
Oh, no.

97
00:10:02,657 --> 00:10:05,368
Don't do it, stop!

98
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:11,040
You damn psychopath!

99
00:10:19,757 --> 00:10:21,759
It wouldn't connect back, normally.

100
00:10:21,843 --> 00:10:25,221
See? That's to be expected.

101
00:10:26,556 --> 00:10:28,266
But his finger...

102
00:10:49,996 --> 00:10:51,372
Interesting, isn't it?

103
00:10:52,331 --> 00:10:54,459
But this is not the purpose
of this experiment.

104
00:10:55,626 --> 00:10:57,295
The important part is just about to begin.

105
00:10:58,296 --> 00:11:02,341
Take a good look
at what happens to your finger.

106
00:11:23,613 --> 00:11:26,699
How did something like
this come into this world?

107
00:11:26,783 --> 00:11:29,494
How should I know?

108
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:39,962
Don't you dare
call him a monster.

109
00:11:40,922 --> 00:11:43,758
All of this is a miracle.

110
00:11:43,841 --> 00:11:49,347
That life was created in this universe,
that a Connect has finally appeared,

111
00:11:50,097 --> 00:11:52,308
and that I've met him.

112
00:11:55,186 --> 00:11:56,938
You don't need Z anymore. Right?

113
00:11:58,147 --> 00:12:00,691
I'm here now.

114
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:03,319
That is true.

115
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:09,450
Spare Z's life, please.

116
00:12:11,244 --> 00:12:12,912
Okay, I'll let him go.

117
00:12:20,837 --> 00:12:26,384
If you accept my proposal
to become one with me.

118
00:12:29,053 --> 00:12:30,638
"Become one"?

119
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,935
N... no, that's not it,
you m... misunderstand.

120
00:12:36,018 --> 00:12:38,187
What this bastard means
is that he'd cut my head off

121
00:12:39,564 --> 00:12:42,692
and switch bodies,
or something like that...

122
00:12:42,775 --> 00:12:45,945
Doesn't that sound weirder?
Think about it.

123
00:12:47,738 --> 00:12:52,285
You're really the corpse art murderer...

124
00:13:01,544 --> 00:13:03,838
If Guitar Man doesn't accept my proposal,

125
00:13:06,507 --> 00:13:10,011
then I'll be putting you up somewhere
as my next piece.

126
00:13:13,806 --> 00:13:15,391
You crazy bastard.

127
00:13:23,065 --> 00:13:25,109
Wow, what a cool Santa Claus
we got here.

128
00:13:27,862 --> 00:13:29,280
Who's there?

129
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:33,534
Who is it?

130
00:13:43,002 --> 00:13:44,879
Oh, look who's here.

131
00:13:48,132 --> 00:13:50,509
Our missing wallet
turned itself back in, then?

132
00:13:50,593 --> 00:13:54,847
I got tired of running around.
And I brought a friend, too.

133
00:14:04,357 --> 00:14:05,524
What is that?

134
00:14:07,568 --> 00:14:08,736
A monster?

135
00:14:11,781 --> 00:14:14,408
You shouldn't say something like that
all of a sudden.

136
00:14:16,243 --> 00:14:17,912
It's taboo.

137
00:14:19,455 --> 00:14:21,165
Say it again.

138
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,000
What?

139
00:14:24,502 --> 00:14:25,336
Monster?

140
00:16:09,023 --> 00:16:13,819
Yeah, okay, yeah, hang on, sir,
remember how we couldn't recover

141
00:16:13,903 --> 00:16:17,073
some photos in that digital camera
found at the irrigation channel?

142
00:16:17,156 --> 00:16:19,116
-Yeah.
-They were all completely recovered.

143
00:16:20,493 --> 00:16:21,952
Send them right now.

144
00:16:25,915 --> 00:16:29,502
Aw, Sungjun, ah...

145
00:16:29,585 --> 00:16:31,295
Oh, oh, damn, wait a second.

146
00:16:31,378 --> 00:16:35,382
-Man, you make my life so difficult.
-Are you all right? Wait...

147
00:16:37,676 --> 00:16:40,930
We can find the GPS data
for this photo here, too, right?

148
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:42,223
Of course.

149
00:16:44,225 --> 00:16:45,893
Let's go over here, right now.

150
00:16:45,976 --> 00:16:50,064
Yes, sir. Yeah, right,
Detective Choi and I are heading down

151
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:53,234
to that building in photo number 28 now.

152
00:16:53,317 --> 00:16:55,027
So you inform the superiors

153
00:16:55,111 --> 00:16:57,780
and bring every SWAT team member
available.

154
00:17:13,462 --> 00:17:16,215
Let Z go right now!

155
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:25,015
By saying that, do you mean
to accept my proposal?

156
00:17:57,506 --> 00:17:58,549
Oh...

157
00:18:04,555 --> 00:18:05,890
Mr. Z.

158
00:18:07,266 --> 00:18:08,559
Mr. Z.

159
00:18:10,436 --> 00:18:11,896
Can you hear me?

160
00:18:13,856 --> 00:18:15,024
Mr. Z...

161
00:18:21,071 --> 00:18:22,281
Sorry.

162
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:33,042
You were uncovering...

163
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,631
...that damned murder case,

164
00:18:41,717 --> 00:18:44,553
and I got in the way, didn't I?

165
00:18:47,264 --> 00:18:49,475
No.

166
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,103
It's all my fault,

167
00:18:55,147 --> 00:18:57,149
I dragged you into this.

168
00:19:06,408 --> 00:19:08,744
Feels like I got in the way...

169
00:19:19,713 --> 00:19:22,841
Sorry...

170
00:19:27,221 --> 00:19:29,181
I couldn't be...

171
00:19:32,017 --> 00:19:33,686
of any help....

172
00:19:42,903 --> 00:19:44,113
Mr. Z.

173
00:19:46,573 --> 00:19:47,866
Mr. Z.

174
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,330
Oh, Mr. Z!

175
00:20:13,517 --> 00:20:18,439
Y... your arrangement for that song...

176
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,276
was truly the best.

177
00:20:28,407 --> 00:20:33,620
I... I really wanted to say th...

178
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:39,293
thank you, I'm sorry.

179
00:21:49,738 --> 00:21:51,490
He got out of his binding?

180
00:21:52,366 --> 00:21:54,785
That never gets old.

181
00:22:12,219 --> 00:22:13,887
Tired from all that fighting, aren't you?

182
00:22:16,014 --> 00:22:17,224
Take a break.

183
00:22:44,877 --> 00:22:48,338
Ah, please, please, oh, come on.

184
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,896
Dongsoo?

185
00:23:07,232 --> 00:23:08,275
Irang?

186
00:23:10,152 --> 00:23:12,112
Irang!

187
00:23:20,037 --> 00:23:21,371
Who are you?

188
00:23:27,503 --> 00:23:28,921
A Connect...

189
00:23:31,256 --> 00:23:32,674
There's a woman, too?

190
00:23:37,596 --> 00:23:39,348
What's happening?

191
00:23:45,687 --> 00:23:47,356
You burnt an awful lot of cash.

192
00:23:48,315 --> 00:23:51,985
I did think the corpse art
was uncanny all the way around,

193
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:56,073
but you really put your whole back into it
behind the scenes, huh?

194
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:02,371
Can your bodies' abilities be passed
down to the next generation?

195
00:24:03,205 --> 00:24:07,000
That's what I wanted to know.
But you're curious too?

196
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:14,508
I wonder what a rich murderer is into.

197
00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:19,471
You want to take Dongsoo's body
and make a baby with me?

198
00:24:19,555 --> 00:24:22,391
Or would you like to take my body
and make a baby with Dongsoo?

199
00:24:24,017 --> 00:24:26,228
Surprise, surprise.
Maybe you're into the latter, huh?

200
00:24:28,355 --> 00:24:32,818
And which do you prefer? Either way,
we will bear a Connect's offspring.

201
00:24:32,901 --> 00:24:36,780
Personally, I want nothing more than
for you to die here right now.

202
00:24:36,863 --> 00:24:42,202
Hm, that will go according to fate.
And your name is?

203
00:24:42,578 --> 00:24:43,704
Irang!

204
00:24:44,329 --> 00:24:47,541
Hey! He was talking to me!

205
00:25:22,784 --> 00:25:25,829
Ha, you bastard...

206
00:26:09,665 --> 00:26:10,791
Ah...

207
00:26:26,598 --> 00:26:29,851
Sir, looks like we could enter

208
00:26:29,935 --> 00:26:31,478
through up there.

209
00:26:32,521 --> 00:26:34,356
-Go that way.
-Yes, sir.

210
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:48,745
I... Irang, what happened to you?
Are you okay?

211
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,249
You're one to talk.

212
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:54,459
Where is he?

213
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:56,962
Someone's here, but I don't know who.

214
00:26:58,004 --> 00:26:59,381
He went that way.

215
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:03,260
You go finish him.

216
00:27:04,928 --> 00:27:06,555
I'll leave how it ends up to you.

217
00:27:08,223 --> 00:27:09,725
What do you mean?

218
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:15,522
Fate or chance, it doesn't end here.

219
00:27:24,448 --> 00:27:28,160
The future must be changed.

220
00:28:28,428 --> 00:28:31,848
What the... This one's a Connect too?

221
00:28:48,198 --> 00:28:51,701
We'll have to get rid of you.
You know too much.

222
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,508
I remember you.

223
00:29:06,591 --> 00:29:09,261
From the security camera
at Oh Jinseop's building.

224
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,474
So you're a Connect, too?

225
00:29:14,975 --> 00:29:17,435
There you go again with that nonsense.

226
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:20,939
It would have been better for you
to play the fool.

227
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,402
Is Oh Jinseop here?

228
00:29:26,444 --> 00:29:27,821
And Ha Dongsoo too?

229
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:36,037
What difference would it make if you know?
You're going to die here and now anyway.

230
00:29:40,959 --> 00:29:45,547
Even if I die,
I want to uncover the truth...

231
00:29:45,881 --> 00:29:47,632
That's what detectives do.

232
00:29:47,716 --> 00:29:50,552
Oh, how noble of you.

233
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,805
And how unfortunate.

234
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:58,310
If you didn't know anything, I would have
helped you with the investigation.

235
00:30:01,563 --> 00:30:06,234
We will survive, whatever it takes.

236
00:30:08,194 --> 00:30:10,739
Killing a few detectives
to reach that end?

237
00:30:12,616 --> 00:30:14,117
That's nothing.

238
00:30:27,714 --> 00:30:33,136
I thought I'd seen my fair share
of bad things in life,

239
00:30:35,639 --> 00:30:42,354
but I guess I have a long ways to go
until I've seen it all.

240
00:30:42,437 --> 00:30:49,444
I can't imagine what tough lives you
and Ha Dongsoo must have had.

241
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:08,088
How much are you able
to recover from?

242
00:31:11,424 --> 00:31:13,009
For example...

243
00:31:19,015 --> 00:31:23,019
What would happen
if I shot you in the head?

244
00:31:28,149 --> 00:31:31,027
Would that stop your body
from moving temporarily?

245
00:31:34,322 --> 00:31:37,951
If that works,
the next time you open your eyes,

246
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,873
your body will have been swallowed...

247
00:31:48,628 --> 00:31:51,339
by late-stage cancer.

248
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:05,520
What have you been trying to do
all this time

249
00:32:05,603 --> 00:32:07,439
with that immortal body of yours?

250
00:32:12,068 --> 00:32:15,488
Don't tell me some pathetic dream to live

251
00:32:15,572 --> 00:32:19,868
a normal life was all it was.

252
00:32:36,551 --> 00:32:37,969
I'm not like you.

253
00:32:39,304 --> 00:32:42,307
If I could, I'd live an ordinary life.

254
00:32:42,849 --> 00:32:47,729
I will never give my body over to you.

00:35:58,544 --> 00:36:00,004
Give me back my eyeball.

272
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,655
I'll give you a taste
of your own medicine.

273
00:37:10,116 --> 00:37:11,284
Stop it!

274
00:37:17,623 --> 00:37:21,252
Don't. I am begging you to stop.

275
00:37:27,425 --> 00:37:32,221
No matter how despicable and horrid

276
00:37:32,305 --> 00:37:34,599
this murderer is, if you kill him,

277
00:37:34,682 --> 00:37:36,601
I have no choice but to prosecute you,

278
00:37:37,977 --> 00:37:40,313
because you will also be
a murderer yourself.

279
00:37:47,278 --> 00:37:48,738
This lowlife...

280
00:37:50,573 --> 00:37:52,283
took precious lives.

281
00:37:56,871 --> 00:37:58,081
Is that right?

282
00:37:59,957 --> 00:38:02,335
Yes, well, it's over.

283
00:38:03,461 --> 00:38:08,800
Leave this all to me,
and you'd better get out of here.

284
00:38:09,384 --> 00:38:11,177
You've got someone waiting for you.

285
00:38:16,349 --> 00:38:17,558
Irang.

286
00:38:32,615 --> 00:38:36,035
Pretty soon SWAT guys will barge in here.

287
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:39,914
They won't bat an eye at your story.

288
00:39:06,566 --> 00:39:10,736
Dongsoo, we have to go. They're coming.

289
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,904
They?

290
00:39:16,325 --> 00:39:17,618
Hurry!
