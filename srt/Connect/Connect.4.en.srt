1
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,066
What's your name?

2
00:00:55,152 --> 00:00:57,195
Your name. Kid, are you deaf?

3
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,371
Ha Dongsoo.

4
00:01:15,672 --> 00:01:16,590
Oh?

5
00:01:20,135 --> 00:01:21,261
Oh, what's up?

6
00:01:22,512 --> 00:01:24,139
Did something happen?

7
00:01:32,272 --> 00:01:33,857
How about we have a nice chat.

8
00:01:34,608 --> 00:01:37,777
I got a lot of questions about this eye.

9
00:01:41,448 --> 00:01:45,118
Hey. Scream and I'll slit your throat.

10
00:01:46,661 --> 00:01:48,371
Go ahead, you can talk.

11
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,916
Please don't kill me.

12
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,335
Just let me live.

13
00:01:53,793 --> 00:01:55,587
I'll tell you everything.

14
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,297
Only if you talk.

15
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:00,467
My eye.

16
00:02:01,426 --> 00:02:03,637
Let's start with how you got it.

17
00:02:04,346 --> 00:02:06,306
I... I don't know.

18
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,895
I just did the surgery.

19
00:02:11,978 --> 00:02:13,730
I don't know anything.

20
00:02:14,814 --> 00:02:16,483
That's not what I wanted to hear.

21
00:03:03,571 --> 00:03:05,699
This damn geezer…

22
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:08,285
Hey, gramps!

23
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,631
Why did you break
into M&T Planning?

24
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:29,180
What were you doing running
from the crime scene?

25
00:03:29,264 --> 00:03:30,765
Did those thugs have anything
to do with it?

26
00:03:33,143 --> 00:03:34,019
Come on!

27
00:03:34,602 --> 00:03:37,022
Not gonna talk, are you?

28
00:03:38,023 --> 00:03:41,026
Fine. See for yourself.

29
00:03:41,943 --> 00:03:44,988
Explain this photo.

30
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,703
What are you, a hyena?

31
00:03:51,953 --> 00:03:53,663
People are dying left and right,

32
00:03:54,497 --> 00:03:57,334
and it's strange that you keep showing up.

33
00:04:05,216 --> 00:04:06,301
Hey.

34
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:10,889
You went to see the astrologer, right?

35
00:04:10,972 --> 00:04:11,973
Astra.

36
00:04:17,645 --> 00:04:20,065
God, can you believe this guy?

37
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:25,028
How'd you know that what you talked about
with the astrologer

38
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:29,741
at Astra had anything
to do with the corpse art?

39
00:04:36,331 --> 00:04:37,665
All right, this bastard did it.

40
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:39,542
Hey.

41
00:04:40,377 --> 00:04:43,546
Say it, you scumbag.
We know you killed them.

42
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,217
Say it, damn it. You killed them! Right?
Say it.

43
00:04:49,677 --> 00:04:50,804
I knew 'cause of...

44
00:04:53,515 --> 00:04:56,684
'Cause of a vision.

45
00:04:57,102 --> 00:04:58,311
A vision?

46
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,857
No, I mean...

47
00:05:07,195 --> 00:05:08,571
Th... the vision...

48
00:05:09,906 --> 00:05:13,701
It was kind of like seeing double, maybe?

49
00:05:16,246 --> 00:05:19,707
If you're gonna keep this up,
there's nothing we can do.

50
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,709
You want psychiatric evaluation,
don't you?

51
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:26,589
Let's do a quick test.

52
00:05:27,757 --> 00:05:29,551
How many am I holding?

53
00:05:30,301 --> 00:05:33,763
No, I don't always have them.

54
00:05:36,724 --> 00:05:40,437
Sometimes, uh, how do I...

55
00:05:42,981 --> 00:05:46,568
So, I get this insane pain out of nowhere,

56
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:52,615
that's when the vision starts.

57
00:05:56,244 --> 00:05:57,662
-Why, you piece of…
-Sungjun.

58
00:06:15,763 --> 00:06:18,141
You know, it's unusual.

59
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,353
Yes, it really is an unusual case.

60
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:24,105
So…

61
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,028
we have to throw common sense
out the window

62
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:31,237
and deal with this.

63
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,824
All right.

64
00:06:40,455 --> 00:06:41,539
Sit down.

65
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:49,380
You can put your eye patch on if you want.

66
00:07:15,114 --> 00:07:16,115
You know,

67
00:07:17,825 --> 00:07:21,037
I don't think you're lying.

68
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:26,459
And it seems like I'll have to take
your story about the visions

69
00:07:26,543 --> 00:07:30,421
as it is to get you talking, right?

70
00:07:30,505 --> 00:07:31,798
Hmm?

71
00:07:34,342 --> 00:07:35,635
So I just gotta ask...

72
00:07:38,137 --> 00:07:43,893
Out of all the visions, which one concerns
you the most right now?

73
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:52,360
The one about the murder
that's about to happen.

74
00:07:54,612 --> 00:07:55,572
Murder?

75
00:07:57,782 --> 00:08:00,159
Three little girls, elementary school age.

76
00:08:00,785 --> 00:08:02,954
Little girls?

77
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:06,416
I saw the drawing, the design.

78
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:11,504
It was a new drawing...
Different from the past four corpse arts.

79
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:21,514
What about the symbol for Pluto.
How'd you know about that?

80
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:24,601
It was drawn there too,
in the corner of the design.

81
00:08:27,312 --> 00:08:30,940
Right, then...

82
00:08:34,485 --> 00:08:37,280
Here. This is the victim's body.

83
00:08:39,449 --> 00:08:43,786
It was carved on the corpse art.

84
00:08:44,954 --> 00:08:46,164
Really?

85
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,169
Just so we're clear,

86
00:08:52,086 --> 00:08:54,922
I don't think you did it.

87
00:08:58,551 --> 00:09:03,556
I just wanna protect you as a witness.

88
00:09:04,641 --> 00:09:06,684
So tell me.

89
00:09:07,185 --> 00:09:09,646
Hm. Why?

90
00:09:11,314 --> 00:09:12,482
How...

91
00:09:15,485 --> 00:09:16,861
do you get those visions?

92
00:09:24,118 --> 00:09:25,703
Those thugs…

93
00:09:31,793 --> 00:09:32,710
I...

94
00:09:57,944 --> 00:09:59,362
You wanna go somewhere else?

95
00:10:09,831 --> 00:10:13,626
I'm telling you! I don't know anything.

96
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:20,299
What's that? What're you gonna do with it?
What're you gonna do to me?

97
00:10:24,011 --> 00:10:27,640
Just... just what,
just what are you gonna do?

98
00:10:27,724 --> 00:10:30,393
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait...

99
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:31,436
Ah!

100
00:10:41,028 --> 00:10:44,532
Oh, oh, okay, okay just, please just stop.

101
00:10:44,907 --> 00:10:48,703
I'll tell you everything, please stop.

102
00:10:48,786 --> 00:10:49,620
Tell me what?

103
00:10:49,704 --> 00:10:52,623
Whatever, whatever it is you want,
all of it.

104
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:59,297
And what do you think that is?

105
00:11:00,673 --> 00:11:03,968
Please, please stop.

106
00:11:20,276 --> 00:11:23,154
You even got someone to stalk me
after the surgery, didn't you?

107
00:11:27,492 --> 00:11:30,369
At first I thought, maybe it was
for customer follow-up.

108
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:35,082
But it was for the eye, wasn't it?
What is this eye?

109
00:11:37,001 --> 00:11:42,465
It... It could be a Connect.

110
00:11:43,966 --> 00:11:44,926
A Connect?

111
00:11:46,761 --> 00:11:49,847
It's been over two months

112
00:11:51,098 --> 00:11:53,893
since you came to us, right?

113
00:12:01,984 --> 00:12:03,319
Help me.

114
00:12:05,613 --> 00:12:11,285
Whoa, how'd you find this place?
What happened to you?

115
00:12:12,328 --> 00:12:14,997
You look like you work at an office.

116
00:12:15,957 --> 00:12:18,960
I heard this place doesn't ask
a lot of questions.

117
00:12:20,253 --> 00:12:22,839
Think you can patch me up?

118
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:28,052
Who knows what'll happen
if I put my hands on you.

119
00:12:28,135 --> 00:12:29,512
Go some place else.

120
00:12:30,012 --> 00:12:31,180
I'll pay.

121
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,517
A lot.

122
00:12:36,435 --> 00:12:37,478
Huh?

123
00:12:40,606 --> 00:12:44,277
Well, what does a doctor care
about his patient's job?

124
00:12:45,152 --> 00:12:46,821
Go lie down on that bed.

125
00:12:52,577 --> 00:12:55,037
Don't bother trying anything dumb…

126
00:12:56,414 --> 00:12:57,665
while I'm out.

127
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,127
My cancer's all over my body.

128
00:13:06,507 --> 00:13:09,677
Looks like you've done your research.

129
00:13:11,095 --> 00:13:12,513
How do you like this place?

130
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:14,849
It's a nice place to talk.

131
00:13:25,985 --> 00:13:27,820
This is the rooftop.

132
00:13:28,821 --> 00:13:30,406
Don't do anything stupid.

133
00:14:24,377 --> 00:14:29,882
Typically after getting the eye
and the internal organs,

134
00:14:30,675 --> 00:14:34,053
the rest are just thrown out.

135
00:14:35,638 --> 00:14:40,977
That day,
I was working like any other day,

136
00:14:43,062 --> 00:14:44,605
but he ran away.

137
00:14:45,773 --> 00:14:49,318
Ran away? Did the anesthesia not work?

138
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,199
Well, I opened his chest,

139
00:14:56,367 --> 00:14:58,703
but he ran.

140
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,791
Like the cuts just healed
in the blink of an eye?

141
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,547
So you know.

142
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:12,591
Why my body is like this…

143
00:15:15,761 --> 00:15:18,556
how it became like this,
I couldn't tell you if you asked.

144
00:15:21,142 --> 00:15:22,476
I just don't know how it happened.

145
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:31,277
I did not expect that.

146
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:36,949
They call this type of body...

147
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,663
They call it a Connect.
I just learned about it.

148
00:15:44,248 --> 00:15:49,086
So basically, a body called
a Connect rolled in,

149
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:52,131
and you decided to test
an eye transplant...

150
00:16:06,437 --> 00:16:08,230
...on me.

151
00:16:09,732 --> 00:16:10,941
Around the year 2000,

152
00:16:12,193 --> 00:16:14,445
Jeongdo Pharmaceuticals made
this groundbreaking discovery

153
00:16:15,905 --> 00:16:20,076
in biotechnology
at their research facility.

154
00:16:21,577 --> 00:16:24,997
They called it "Connect",

155
00:16:25,081 --> 00:16:27,083
and people said…

156
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:34,131
it was a revolutionary invention
in bio-transplanting.

157
00:16:35,758 --> 00:16:40,721
Some even said it could have something
to do with immortality.

158
00:16:43,265 --> 00:16:49,647
So that means I have a body part
that's immortal, right?

159
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:53,818
We share the vision.

160
00:16:57,446 --> 00:16:59,031
Whatever he sees,

161
00:17:01,617 --> 00:17:02,910
I see.

162
00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:10,209
That's good news, right?
To someone with late-stage cancer.

163
00:17:24,181 --> 00:17:25,224
Please,

164
00:17:26,183 --> 00:17:28,144
you said you wouldn't kill me.

165
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,164
That was everything.

166
00:17:49,957 --> 00:17:54,378
Now what about you, detective?
What are you gonna do?

167
00:17:57,631 --> 00:18:01,051
Are you gonna expose me?

168
00:18:13,731 --> 00:18:17,401
It's the only way we can convince people.
The only way.

169
00:18:18,444 --> 00:18:21,739
And I have to do it
'cause I'm a detective.

170
00:18:22,489 --> 00:18:25,701
'Cause I have to protect victims
and catch criminals.

171
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,129
What, so what I did doesn't matter…

172
00:18:39,381 --> 00:18:40,841
'cause I'm a monster?

173
00:18:46,013 --> 00:18:48,807
Yeah, how'd the background check go?

174
00:18:48,891 --> 00:18:50,059
Long story short, it's...

175
00:18:50,142 --> 00:18:51,268
Wait, just a second.

176
00:18:53,229 --> 00:18:54,188
Go ahead.

177
00:18:54,605 --> 00:18:57,316
Everything that Ha Dongsoo told us
about his identity is fake.

178
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,443
His fingerprints aren't even registered.

179
00:18:59,944 --> 00:19:06,825
And, well, that makes it
legally impossible to say he even exists.

180
00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:08,369
Completely unidentified.

181
00:19:09,912 --> 00:19:11,580
You heard it yourself.

182
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:20,047
Detective Park, look into
those organ hunters a little more.

183
00:19:20,422 --> 00:19:23,300
Already on it. Oh Jinseop, too.

184
00:19:28,264 --> 00:19:29,723
Did you lie to me?

185
00:19:33,018 --> 00:19:35,854
Your part's done. We don't need...

186
00:19:35,938 --> 00:19:37,106
Detective!

187
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:42,111
I'm the only one who knows the faces
of the kids he's gonna kill.

188
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:46,824
-So please just let me go.
-No.

189
00:19:46,907 --> 00:19:49,118
We need to stop him.

190
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:52,621
We're gonna catch him. So let it go.

191
00:20:06,135 --> 00:20:07,303
What are you doing?

192
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:13,642
Hey, stop it.

193
00:20:21,317 --> 00:20:22,901
I said, stop it.

194
00:20:41,253 --> 00:20:43,881
This world's never been kind to me.

195
00:20:45,632 --> 00:20:48,135
I shouldn't have trusted a detective.

196
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:53,807
Don’t move.

197
00:20:55,976 --> 00:20:57,186
Stop right there.

198
00:21:00,105 --> 00:21:02,024
I said, stop!

199
00:21:05,736 --> 00:21:10,491
Get down. Get down.

200
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,793
Stop!

201
00:21:23,712 --> 00:21:26,090
Argh...

202
00:21:56,995 --> 00:21:57,830
Damn it!

203
00:22:10,676 --> 00:22:11,885
Excuse me.

204
00:22:14,721 --> 00:22:16,348
Excuse me. Are you all right?

205
00:22:18,142 --> 00:22:22,187
Hey, go, go, go, hurry!

206
00:22:23,105 --> 00:22:23,939
Move!

207
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,074
Move!

208
00:22:34,575 --> 00:22:35,492
What is it?

209
00:22:36,243 --> 00:22:37,870
Hey, Jinsoo!

210
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:41,373
Hey, what happened up there
at the rooftop?

211
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,629

Damn it, why isn't he picking up?

221
00:23:30,923 --> 00:23:33,884
Did he... get caught?

222
00:23:58,784 --> 00:24:00,911
Whoever it was, bring him to me now,

Yeah.

This is Woojin, sir.

I'm busy, make it quick.

00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:53,463
Oh Jinseop hasn't been home
since yesterday.

230
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:59,052
Man, people just love going missing here.
These idiots just keep disappearing.

231
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:06,643
So, what do I do? Should I break in?

232
00:25:06,727 --> 00:25:08,562
Grab anything that can be a lead.

233
00:25:08,645 --> 00:25:09,813
Yes, sir.

00:25:33,629 --> 00:25:35,255
The number you have dialed is unattended.

235
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:36,423

An aspiring novelist wire-tapping
and tailing people.

237
00:26:43,907 --> 00:26:47,077
Damn, you do all kinds of things.

238
00:26:49,955 --> 00:26:54,334
You interested in that eye
that went to Oh Jinseop?

239
00:26:56,586 --> 00:26:58,004
You don't gotta talk.

240
00:26:58,922 --> 00:27:01,091
You'll spill eventually.

241
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:07,055
Did you guys even know

242
00:27:07,514 --> 00:27:10,600
who Oh Jinseop was before the transplant?

243
00:27:12,227 --> 00:27:16,189
We don't care about that.
We just need the money.

244
00:27:49,973 --> 00:27:51,391
I'm gonna set
all the elementary schools

245
00:27:51,475 --> 00:27:52,934
in the city on fire.

246
00:27:55,061 --> 00:27:57,814
You know I'm serious.

247
00:27:59,483 --> 00:28:01,651
Any kid walking the streets...

248
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:04,738
is gonna die.

249
00:28:13,371 --> 00:28:14,247
Yeah.

250
00:28:14,331 --> 00:28:15,290
119 just reported

251
00:28:15,373 --> 00:28:16,833
a possible terrorist attack
and sent us a call recording.

252
00:28:16,917 --> 00:28:17,918
Oh, yeah?

253
00:28:18,001 --> 00:28:19,419
And the voice is Ha Dongsoo's.

254
00:28:19,503 --> 00:28:24,216
Then send a shut-down notice
to all the elementary schools in the city.

255
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:27,969
Say there's a terrorist on the loose.

256
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:32,474
Heard he'll bomb an elementary school,
something like that.

257
00:28:32,557 --> 00:28:36,728
I'll report to the higher-ups,
be quick. Okay.

258
00:28:36,812 --> 00:28:38,230
Breaking news.

259
00:28:38,313 --> 00:28:41,233
Early this morning, a threatening call
was made announcing

260
00:28:41,316 --> 00:28:44,945
a bombing of all the elementary schools
in Seohan City.

261
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,781
An elementary school in the city
actually suffered an explosion

262
00:28:47,864 --> 00:28:50,367
-around the time of the threat.
-Interesting move, Guitar Man.

263
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:54,621
And firefighters were dispatched
and put out the fire in an hour.

264
00:28:54,704 --> 00:28:56,915
Fortunately, there were no casualties.

265
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:17,352
OFFICIAL_Z:
DID YOU LISTEN TO THE SONG?

266
00:29:17,435 --> 00:29:20,438
I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW
WHAT THE ORIGINAL ARTIST THINKS

267
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:26,027
OF COURSE I LISTENED TO IT.
YOU'RE THE BEST MUSICIAN.

268
00:29:26,987 --> 00:29:28,738
LONELY GUITAR MAN:
OF COURSE I LISTENED TO IT.

269
00:29:28,822 --> 00:29:30,115
YOU'RE THE BEST MUSICIAN.

270
00:29:36,371 --> 00:29:37,873
OFFICIAL_Z:
WHEW… I WAS WORRIED…

271
00:29:37,956 --> 00:29:39,207
GLAD TO KNOW YOU LIKED IT.

272
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:40,417
Man…

273
00:29:45,589 --> 00:29:48,300
OFFICIAL_Z: YOUR SONG IS REALLY GREAT.
EVEN BETTER THAN MY ARRANGEMENT

274
00:29:48,383 --> 00:29:50,135
SO DON'T GIVE UP…
REACH ME IF YOU WANT TO MEET

275
00:29:50,218 --> 00:29:52,888
IT'D BE EVEN BETTER
IF WE COULD PLAY TOGETHER.

276
00:30:09,571 --> 00:30:14,743
NEW TEXT MESSAGE:
CAN YOU SEE THIS?

277
00:30:18,788 --> 00:30:25,795
IF YOU CAN, CALL ME

278
00:30:52,781 --> 00:30:54,157
Who are you?

279
00:30:57,619 --> 00:31:00,163
Hiding the caller ID, that's a surprise.

280
00:31:02,082 --> 00:31:03,959
That's not even your phone.

281
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:07,462
You seem smart.

282
00:31:08,672 --> 00:31:12,342
What do I call you? Guitar Man?

283
00:31:13,218 --> 00:31:16,304
-Pyromaniac?
-Shut your trap, you lunatic.

284
00:31:19,766 --> 00:31:24,104
You're a real hothead.
You were like that at the office building.

285
00:31:25,021 --> 00:31:27,399
You think the world revolves around you?

286
00:31:28,692 --> 00:31:30,777
Not after this.

287
00:31:33,321 --> 00:31:34,948
It's too late, you know.

288
00:31:36,491 --> 00:31:37,826
What do you mean?

289
00:31:38,702 --> 00:31:42,706
I mean it's already
gone on to the next phase.

290
00:31:44,207 --> 00:31:45,834
Don’t you think it's fate?

291
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:49,587
That one of your eyes ended up with me.

292
00:31:50,422 --> 00:31:53,008
Tell me, what's the next phase?

293
00:31:53,091 --> 00:31:54,718
That's for you to find out.

294
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,765
I want you to know everything
about me, okay?

295
00:32:03,018 --> 00:32:06,438
Let's talk again, Connect buddy.

296
00:32:43,183 --> 00:32:44,434
Oh!

297
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,978
Man, it's a dog turd.

298
00:32:47,979 --> 00:32:49,689
Damn it.

299
00:32:54,611 --> 00:32:56,780
Just my luck.

300
00:33:19,594 --> 00:33:21,054
Why didn't you answer my call?

301
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,100
I'm sorry, I was dealing with something.

302
00:33:27,602 --> 00:33:29,604
You were right.

303
00:33:29,687 --> 00:33:31,397
They know I'm a Connect.

304
00:33:32,816 --> 00:33:34,609
It might get dangerous for you too.

305
00:33:37,821 --> 00:33:39,948
Right now,
your place is the least safe for you.

306
00:33:56,589 --> 00:33:58,675
SCREENING SCHEDULE: AUDITION

307
00:34:18,403 --> 00:34:21,406
Wow, this place was a movie theater?

308
00:34:24,492 --> 00:34:25,994
Are you gonna run away again?

309
00:34:29,164 --> 00:34:32,458
If you're scared of getting caught,
you better stay here.

310
00:34:32,542 --> 00:34:34,043
I'll go get your eye back.

311
00:34:37,088 --> 00:34:38,131
How?

312
00:34:40,091 --> 00:34:41,342
However I can.

313
00:34:53,146 --> 00:34:54,397
What do you know?

314
00:34:56,441 --> 00:34:58,443
What do you think I don't know?

315
00:35:00,069 --> 00:35:01,529
What it's like living as a Connect?

316
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,619
I don't think we're that different.

317
00:35:09,621 --> 00:35:10,747
What?

318
00:35:18,213 --> 00:35:19,547
Try stabbing me.

319
00:35:22,675 --> 00:35:23,801
Are you insane?

320
00:35:31,976 --> 00:35:33,436
You'll know once you stab me.

321
00:35:37,065 --> 00:35:38,149
And if you get hurt?

322
00:35:41,569 --> 00:35:42,946
Are you gonna take responsibility?

323
00:36:20,942 --> 00:36:22,318
You're the same as me?

324
00:36:26,906 --> 00:36:27,782
Yeah.

325
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:34,205
Did you lie?

326
00:36:35,581 --> 00:36:37,458
About being saved by a Connect?

327
00:36:39,127 --> 00:36:40,545
Half of it was true,

328
00:36:41,379 --> 00:36:43,715
the part about getting hit
by the dump truck,

329
00:36:43,798 --> 00:36:45,758
and surviving thanks to a Connect body.

330
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:50,013
I was gonna tell you after
you got your eye back.

331
00:37:02,817 --> 00:37:04,902
You don't need a band-aid.

332
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,992
I wished I did.

333
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:15,496
This is something weak kids,

334
00:37:16,372 --> 00:37:18,541
normal kids put on.

335
00:37:20,376 --> 00:37:22,754
This was proof that I was one.

336
00:37:23,171 --> 00:37:27,633
So I started putting it on, but one day

337
00:37:27,717 --> 00:37:30,053
it kind of became a talisman.

338
00:37:32,221 --> 00:37:33,890
When I have this on,

339
00:37:36,476 --> 00:37:38,853
they wouldn't find out I'm a Connect.

340
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,358
But...

341
00:37:44,984 --> 00:37:46,235
You're right.

342
00:37:55,828 --> 00:37:57,246
I don't need it anymore.

343
00:38:11,386 --> 00:38:12,470
I'm happy.

344
00:38:13,429 --> 00:38:14,430
Mm?

345
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:20,937
That there's someone just like me...

346
00:38:24,148 --> 00:38:25,566
I'm really glad that it's you,

347
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,236
Choi Irang.

348
00:38:33,783 --> 00:38:36,702
You don't have to suffer alone now.

349
00:38:44,085 --> 00:38:45,169
Neither do you.

350
00:38:50,049 --> 00:38:51,050
Give me that.

351
00:39:05,231 --> 00:39:06,315
Gimme your hand.

352
00:41:04,725 --> 00:41:07,103
Let's go.

353
00:41:11,607 --> 00:41:13,776
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

354
00:41:17,071 --> 00:41:18,531
Huh, oh.

355
00:41:31,544 --> 00:41:35,548
This is what happens
when you steal someone else's song.

356
00:43:02,927 --> 00:43:04,553
What, what's wrong?

357
00:43:12,853 --> 00:43:14,730
He didn't give up.

358
00:43:29,286 --> 00:43:32,623
