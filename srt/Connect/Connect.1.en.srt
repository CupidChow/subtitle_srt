Pretty eyes.

17
00:02:38,338 --> 00:02:39,589
Sorry?

18
00:02:42,425 --> 00:02:44,594
Do you have good vision?

19
00:02:44,678 --> 00:02:45,971
What?

20
00:02:46,054 --> 00:02:47,681
I mean...

21
00:02:48,765 --> 00:02:51,393
you have nice eyes.

22
00:02:57,857 --> 00:02:59,359
Pretty eyes.

23
00:03:04,364 --> 00:03:06,783
Sweet dreams.

24
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:15,208
A LEAF DROPS IN THE YARD
SAD BUGS UNDER THE FLOORBOARD

BUT TO WHERE ARE YOU GOING

26
00:03:16,376 --> 00:03:17,377
A SHARD OF HEART STOPS LIVING

WHEN SPRINGTIME LEAVES NAMPO FULL OF GREEN

29
00:06:14,596 --> 00:06:16,556
Connect?

30
00:06:17,182 --> 00:06:20,226
DOES ANYONE KNOW

31
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,437
AN URBAN LEGEND CALLED CONNECT?

32
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,523
ANYONE?

33
00:06:25,607 --> 00:06:28,610
I'VE HEARD OF IT.

34
00:06:28,693 --> 00:06:35,700
I'VE BEEN LOOKING UP STORIES

35
00:06:35,783 --> 00:06:40,622
FOR MY WEB NOVEL.

36
00:06:40,705 --> 00:06:46,044
IF YOU HAVE INFO PLEASE SHARE IT. COME ON.

37
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,675
It's a person...

38
00:09:04,307 --> 00:09:05,433
-Look away.
-Move, move.

39
00:09:05,516 --> 00:09:07,143
Pull it out, come on!

40
00:09:07,226 --> 00:09:09,103
Hey, hey, pull it out!

41
00:09:09,187 --> 00:09:10,396
Yeah, at ease.

42
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,564
Please move back. Move back, please.

43
00:09:11,648 --> 00:09:13,024
You can't walk around.
Oh, please get out of there.

44
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:14,651
Excuse me, over there!

45
00:09:14,776 --> 00:09:16,527
How on earth did they do this?

46
00:09:19,072 --> 00:09:20,198
Wait!

47
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:21,115
Oh, you cannot take pictures.

48
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:22,533
Whoa, no, no, no.
You can't take photos here.

49
00:09:22,617 --> 00:09:24,494
No, stop, stop, stop.
Hey, push them all back.

50
00:09:24,577 --> 00:09:27,789
Move back, move back!

51
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:30,249
Please move back.

52
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,751
I said do not take pictures!

53
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:34,379
Do not take pictures,
do not take pictures!

54
00:09:35,838 --> 00:09:37,048
Move back!

55
00:09:43,012 --> 00:09:44,806
Please look at this.

56
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,266
This looks like...

57
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:52,063
It looks like it was carved
a few hours after death.

58
00:09:52,146 --> 00:09:59,112
What's that? Hold on.
Is this letter P from the alphabet?

59
00:09:59,195 --> 00:10:01,072
The bottom looks like an L.

60
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:02,907
Is it a signature?

61
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,619
You know, like
when an artist finishes a painting

62
00:10:06,703 --> 00:10:08,204
and puts their signature in the corner.

63
00:10:08,287 --> 00:10:11,624
Ha. You mean,
like marking his own signature?

64
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,835
Perverted bastard kills
a person and then...

65
00:10:14,961 --> 00:10:17,171
imitates an artist.

66
00:11:30,495 --> 00:11:32,997
Who might be getting
transported this time?

67
00:12:29,554 --> 00:12:31,639
READ MORE ABOUT TODAY'S ASTROLOGY
AND UPCOMING ASPECTS BY THE HOUR.

68
00:12:31,722 --> 00:12:33,349
Zodiac signs?

69
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:06,132
What are they looking for?

70
00:13:19,645 --> 00:13:20,938
Where is this?

71
00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:35,411
Eye drops?

72
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,094
It's gone.

73
00:13:54,055 --> 00:13:55,681
What is all this?

74
00:14:04,231 --> 00:14:05,608
Could it be...

75
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:30,925
What are you looking at?

76
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:41,686
Huh?

77
00:15:07,086 --> 00:15:08,963
What... what the...

78
00:15:15,302 --> 00:15:19,640
Ugh. That startled me, damn it.

79
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,901
Yeah, what? Yeah, I'm doing it right now.

80
00:15:32,611 --> 00:15:34,280
Cornea and liver?

81
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:37,450
Oh, you don't need those?

82
00:15:39,577 --> 00:15:41,370
Oh, come on...

83
00:15:41,454 --> 00:15:43,622
What's with this sudden bullshit?

84
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:46,834
Huh?

85
00:15:49,587 --> 00:15:53,674
Yeah, okay, got it.

86
00:15:56,093 --> 00:15:59,138
Just don't forget
the money you promised me.

87
00:16:01,098 --> 00:16:03,350
Yeah, yeah.

88
00:16:09,565 --> 00:16:10,483
Yeah.

89
00:16:14,403 --> 00:16:17,448
All right, bye.

90
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:38,737
Hey, is anyone out there?
Get in here, quick!

91
00:17:40,823 --> 00:17:42,449
Hurry!

92
00:17:56,714 --> 00:18:00,092
That night,
when both my eyes were pulled out...

93
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:05,639
Was it transplanted to someone else?

94
00:18:14,857 --> 00:18:19,653
Is that why... I can see
what that person is seeing?

95
00:18:28,037 --> 00:18:29,830
I should have taken both eyes back then.

96
00:19:29,223 --> 00:19:31,183
SEOHAN CITY, A LARGE CROWD GATHER
AT "SAMJI PORT FIREWORKS FESTIVAL"

97
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:44,280
Goddamn it. Fuck. This is the worst.

98
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:03,173
First victim, Kim Hyemi.

99
00:20:03,257 --> 00:20:04,550
FIRST VICTIM: KIM HYEMI
VICTIM 1 KIM HYEMI

100
00:20:04,633 --> 00:20:05,634
SECOND VICTIM: PARK YONGSEOK
VICTIM 2 PARK YONGSEOK

101
00:20:05,718 --> 00:20:07,970
Second victim, Park Yongseok.

102
00:20:09,847 --> 00:20:12,641
There's nothing
that connects the two cases.

103
00:20:13,517 --> 00:20:18,522
Neither case looks like
it was caused by grudge.

104
00:20:19,481 --> 00:20:25,404
Man, we were just digging up
info on Kim Hyemi for nothing.

105
00:20:25,487 --> 00:20:26,822
VICTIM KIM HYEMI
AGE: 22 / OCCUPATION: COLLEGE STUDENT

106
00:20:27,072 --> 00:20:29,366
I mean, if young women
were the only targets,

107
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:33,203
we could approach it
as a typical crazy sex offender case.

108
00:20:34,538 --> 00:20:36,915
But they killed the victim
with so much care and effort

109
00:20:37,499 --> 00:20:39,710
and decorated the victim like an artwork.

110
00:20:39,793 --> 00:20:42,588
This sick psycho...

111
00:20:43,547 --> 00:20:45,507
Even the crowd
thought it was an art display.

112
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:50,346
They embalmed the body,
angled it perfectly...

113
00:20:53,057 --> 00:20:55,100
...and even used resin to coat the body.

114
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:05,778
They made a tear in the flesh
and deliberately let the blood drip?

115
00:21:06,653 --> 00:21:09,948
Could this be intentional or a mistake?

116
00:21:10,449 --> 00:21:13,035
Did they want to show off?

117
00:21:14,578 --> 00:21:19,541
Ah, if only Detective Choi
could sniff out some kind of lead,

118
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,294
that would be great.

119
00:21:22,378 --> 00:21:25,964
You haven't had nosebleed yet, right?

120
00:21:26,548 --> 00:21:27,925
Nosebleed? What is that?

121
00:21:28,008 --> 00:21:32,805
Huh? Nosebleed is nosebleed.
This guy is curious about so many things.

122
00:21:33,138 --> 00:21:35,140
Let me show you. Here.

123
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:39,436
When he comes across a lead
that makes him think "this is it,"

124
00:21:41,105 --> 00:21:42,564
his nose bleeds.

125
00:21:43,607 --> 00:21:45,651
-Why is that?
-Hey, come on.

126
00:21:45,734 --> 00:21:48,904
Well, it's not like you can hide it.

127
00:21:48,987 --> 00:21:51,281
Oh, his grandmother is a big-time shaman.

128
00:21:51,365 --> 00:21:55,452
Many of his relatives are too.
It runs in the family, right?

129
00:21:55,536 --> 00:21:58,914
Is it fun?
Making your supervisor look weird?

130
00:21:59,623 --> 00:22:03,127
Go ask forensics
for the resin component analysis

131
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,964
then find out the purchase route
and seller.

132
00:22:07,047 --> 00:22:08,298
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

133
00:22:08,382 --> 00:22:09,675
Yes.

134
00:22:09,758 --> 00:22:13,429
JUNK SHOP

135
00:22:44,001 --> 00:22:47,838
He should have already been back
by now but I still haven't heard from him.

136
00:22:47,921 --> 00:22:51,633
What could he be doing out there?

137
00:22:51,717 --> 00:22:54,511
He could have waited a few days
for the car repair.

138
00:22:54,595 --> 00:22:58,390
Oh, my. But he just couldn't wait
and went out with his handcart.

139
00:23:04,646 --> 00:23:06,315
I'll go find him.

140
00:23:23,749 --> 00:23:26,627
Go ahead
and say something, damn it.

141
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:31,381
I was out of strength
and I lost grip. I made a mistake, okay?

142
00:23:32,633 --> 00:23:35,052
I'm sorry, okay? I am sorry.

143
00:23:35,135 --> 00:23:39,473
I mean, you just hit a person, so you have
to apologize. That's a given.

144
00:23:39,556 --> 00:23:41,099
-Huh?
-Yeah.

145
00:23:41,183 --> 00:23:44,186
If you're broke, can you kill someone
and then just say "I'm sorry"?

146
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:46,104
-Damn it.
-Come on, please, ah...

147
00:23:46,188 --> 00:23:47,773
"Sorry" doesn't cut it!

148
00:23:47,856 --> 00:23:49,733
I'm begging you like this, please.

149
00:23:49,816 --> 00:23:51,068
Now, what is this? I don't need this.

150
00:23:51,151 --> 00:23:52,653
Whoa.

151
00:23:52,736 --> 00:23:55,072
I mean he's not
even listening to me.

152
00:23:55,155 --> 00:23:57,366
What are you all doing right now?

153
00:23:58,242 --> 00:23:59,284
Sir.

154
00:24:00,077 --> 00:24:04,373
Hey, what are you doing here? Go back.

155
00:24:04,456 --> 00:24:07,751
No, how could I?
What do you think you're doing right now?

156
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:10,754
Damn it, let's go. Quickly.

157
00:24:10,837 --> 00:24:13,549
Huh? Wait, where do you think
you're going?

158
00:24:13,632 --> 00:24:16,301
I'm talking to the man who just hit me
and tried to run away.

159
00:24:16,385 --> 00:24:18,720
Hey, do you want to die?

160
00:24:19,763 --> 00:24:23,976
Hey, look how scared this guy looks.
Man, you're scared as heck, aren't you?

161
00:24:25,185 --> 00:24:27,813
-Hurry up and go.
-I'll call the police.

162
00:24:27,896 --> 00:24:29,273
That little...

163
00:24:35,237 --> 00:24:37,281
-Come out, come out.

00:24:40,951 --> 00:24:43,328
You little...

167
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,723
-Oh, oh.
-Where are you going?

168
00:25:04,516 --> 00:25:06,476
You ready to get stabbed?

169
00:25:15,902 --> 00:25:18,697
He's trembling. See that?
Do you see that? Huh?

170
00:25:24,786 --> 00:25:26,163
This bastard!

171
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:38,925
You crazy bastard,
why didn't you move? Damn it.

172
00:25:46,016 --> 00:25:47,017
Hey...

173
00:25:52,147 --> 00:25:54,274
Let's just stop here, okay?

174
00:25:56,401 --> 00:25:59,488
Hey, this bastard. A monster...

175
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:00,739
Monster.

176
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,783
Monster.

177
00:26:03,158 --> 00:26:05,160
Mo... Monster.

178
00:26:07,704 --> 00:26:08,997
He's a monster!

179
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:12,459
I'm not!

180
00:27:08,598 --> 00:27:09,516
Hurry up, damn it.

181
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:12,853
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
let's just call the cops, come on.

182
00:27:12,936 --> 00:27:15,230
Oh, stop it. That old man
went to call the police.

183
00:27:15,313 --> 00:27:17,232
Oh, let's just fucking go, okay?

184
00:27:17,315 --> 00:27:19,359
Hey, did you see that bastard
was missing an eye? So gross.

185
00:27:19,443 --> 00:27:20,652
-Oh, the eye.
-Oh, man.

186
00:27:20,736 --> 00:27:22,112
Hey, stop!

187
00:27:30,996 --> 00:27:32,456
What was it that you saw?

188
00:27:32,956 --> 00:27:34,332
KARAOKE

189
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:38,003
So he sure
hasn't left this town, huh?

190
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:50,807
Keep looking. Finding that bastard
is most important.

191
00:27:50,891 --> 00:27:51,850
Yes, sir.

192
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:05,238
Why are you all
just standing around?

193
00:28:05,322 --> 00:28:08,033
You heard him.
Go look for him.

194
00:28:15,874 --> 00:28:18,251
Man, what a halfwit.

195
00:28:19,669 --> 00:28:22,130
What are you doing, losing a game?

196
00:28:34,643 --> 00:28:40,190
If the old quack is right,
this is going to be a huge jackpot.

197
00:28:41,691 --> 00:28:43,026
Right?

198
00:28:45,445 --> 00:28:47,864
A body that does not die

199
00:28:48,323 --> 00:28:50,575
would be a living bundle of money.

200
00:28:51,117 --> 00:28:56,581
Exactly, right? And that old quack
had to lose him. So annoying.

201
00:28:59,084 --> 00:29:02,671

Wow.

203
00:29:05,215 --> 00:29:07,884

204
00:29:19,437 --> 00:29:20,438

What is it?

308
00:42:04,702 --> 00:42:07,413

309
00:42:07,913 --> 00:42:08,998
What?

310
00:42:09,624 --> 00:42:10,833

311
00:42:10,916 --> 00:42:12,001

312
00:42:12,668 --> 00:42:14,128
Oh, German. What's it say?

313
00:42:15,254 --> 00:42:16,547
The translation says,

314
00:42:16,964 --> 00:42:19,300
"The perpetrator of this murder
is the worst criminal,

315
00:42:19,383 --> 00:42:22,303
but their artistic sense
does draw out my admiration."

316
00:42:25,514 --> 00:42:26,474
This is French.

317
00:42:26,557 --> 00:42:28,643
Tell us what it says, boy,
the damn translation.

318
00:42:28,976 --> 00:42:31,854
"I wish the case would be resolved
as soon as possible,

319
00:42:31,937 --> 00:42:34,565
but it scares me how part of me
is looking forward to the next piece."

320

BUT I ACKNOWLEDGE HIS ART. TALENT IS BORN!

THE NEUROTICISM WHICH FREUD SPOKE OF,

328
00:43:41,215 --> 00:43:43,426
THAT HAS CONFLICTS WITH EGO,
ONCE GAVE ME TEDIOUS,

329
00:43:43,509 --> 00:43:45,886
TEETH-RATTLING FEAR, BUT IN FACT...

330
00:43:50,808 --> 00:43:53,102
CORPSE ART

331
00:43:53,185 --> 00:43:55,187
SEARCH CORPSE ART

332
00:44:06,615 --> 00:44:08,325
The person who took my eye...

333
00:44:08,909 --> 00:44:13,330
...was a murderer?

334
00:44:45,196 --> 00:44:48,240
It's here, it's here!

335
00:44:49,033 --> 00:44:51,202
Find out everything about this guy.

336
00:44:51,285 --> 00:44:55,206
Okay, so this guy is a strong suspect.

337
00:44:55,289 --> 00:44:57,666
See?

338
00:44:58,626 --> 00:44:59,752
Really?

339
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,591
Come on, you bastard.

340
00:45:18,854 --> 00:45:20,856
He is here.

341
00:45:35,454 --> 00:45:36,664
OCTOBER 14TH - FATHER
JANUARY 21ST - 23RD

342
00:45:36,747 --> 00:45:37,915
FEBRUARY 5TH - MOTHER
SEPTEMBER 28TH - 30TH

343
00:45:40,459 --> 00:45:44,004
Give me back my eye, you murderer.
