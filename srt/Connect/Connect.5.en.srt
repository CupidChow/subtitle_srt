00:01:24,014 --> 00:01:25,140
Sing more...

00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:27,976

♪ Putting them together,
The sound of the city, pack ♪

00:01:38,403 --> 00:01:41,990

Do you want to stop me?

00:02:19,694 --> 00:02:23,615
"Then, come here alone.

10
00:02:26,284 --> 00:02:28,161
If you're late..."

11
00:02:28,245 --> 00:02:29,371
WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 29, 2021

12
00:02:29,454 --> 00:02:30,789
THEN COME HERE ALONE
IF YOU'RE LATE

13
00:02:32,749 --> 00:02:37,254
This man will also become
a part of my collection.

14
00:02:53,103 --> 00:02:55,855
You. You're being too loud.

♪ I'm a little sad, the sound of the ci ♪

I'll kill him.

17
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:09,244
That son of a bitch.

18
00:03:27,554 --> 00:03:28,972
Are you sure?

19
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:33,059
Hey, hurry up and tell him.

20
00:03:33,143 --> 00:03:35,020
Tha...

21
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:39,024
that old man over there, and we met...

22
00:03:39,983 --> 00:03:42,277
Son of a bitch, why didn't you move? Shit!

23
00:03:47,574 --> 00:03:53,413
FUTURE RESOURCE SCRAPYARD

24
00:03:58,335 --> 00:04:00,045
Could Z really still be alive?

25
00:04:01,504 --> 00:04:05,925
He'll keep him alive until he kills me.
It's me that he wants.

26
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:09,012
Then I'll go too.

27
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:13,433
You too?

28
00:04:14,768 --> 00:04:16,394
I wanna see him dead, too.

29
00:04:19,397 --> 00:04:21,316
All right.

30
00:04:27,364 --> 00:04:28,406
Irang.

31
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,835
How did they know we're here?

32
00:04:50,136 --> 00:04:51,346
What is it?

33
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:58,269
Get over here
in 15 minutes, or the old man dies.

34
00:04:58,353 --> 00:05:00,522
My boss is...

35
00:05:04,317 --> 00:05:05,944
If you turn left
at the end of the hallway,

36
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:07,445
there's some stairs leading outside.

37
00:05:09,531 --> 00:05:10,740
Let's go.

38
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:12,784
I'll take care of things here,
so go ahead. Hurry.

39
00:05:13,118 --> 00:05:14,327
Will you be okay?

40
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:16,955
Worried? I'm a tough cookie.

41
00:05:19,124 --> 00:05:20,250
Go!

42
00:05:44,315 --> 00:05:45,608
Over here.

43
00:05:48,278 --> 00:05:49,863
What brings you here?

44
00:05:52,115 --> 00:05:54,284
Are you here for the group tour?

45
00:05:58,663 --> 00:06:00,540
What's this mouse squeaking?

46
00:06:00,623 --> 00:06:02,083
May I see your tickets?

47
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:05,003
Damn bitch talks too fucking much.

48
00:06:09,841 --> 00:06:13,678
Look at this bitch!

49
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:19,767
Hey!

50
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:21,686
Hey! Stop right there!

51
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:22,979
Stop!

52
00:08:14,007 --> 00:08:16,884
WHY DOES IT FEEL LIKE WE'RE ONE,
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING?

53
00:08:16,968 --> 00:08:19,470
I DON'T DISLIKE THE FAMILIARITY,
BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD EITHER.

54
00:08:19,554 --> 00:08:22,181
FEELS LIKE SHIT.

55
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:55,465
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ah, sir!

56
00:09:10,647 --> 00:09:14,192
We can't keep getting
owned by those faggots.

57
00:09:14,275 --> 00:09:18,905
If even the smallest thing goes wrong,
we'll both end up dead. Choose wisely.

58
00:09:18,988 --> 00:09:21,115
There's no turning back now.

59
00:09:26,663 --> 00:09:28,873
What do we do with the old man?

60
00:09:28,956 --> 00:09:31,751
What do you think? Just kill him.

61
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,020
Damn it...

62
00:11:27,575 --> 00:11:28,659
Sir.

63
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:35,291
Monster...

64
00:11:43,716 --> 00:11:45,343
Monster.

65
00:11:51,682 --> 00:11:53,684
Mo... monster!

66
00:11:54,685 --> 00:11:56,145
I'm not!

67
00:12:10,034 --> 00:12:14,956
You... bastard! Monster!

68
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,501
Geez, this... this bitch, this...

69
00:13:00,585 --> 00:13:03,254
You cunt, you've been snooping
on us all along.

70
00:13:06,382 --> 00:13:08,175
Who are you? Huh?

71
00:13:09,051 --> 00:13:11,512
Who put you up to this? Tell me.

72
00:13:12,388 --> 00:13:14,682
You think I did this just because
someone put me up to it?

73
00:13:17,435 --> 00:13:19,312
You do know what we do, right?

74
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:23,733
Do you really want us to gouge
your eyes out,

75
00:13:23,816 --> 00:13:25,985
rip out your organs,
give you a horrible death?

76
00:13:26,777 --> 00:13:29,071
Answer the question.

77
00:13:34,619 --> 00:13:37,038
I wouldn't be playing around like this

78
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:40,708
while my colleague is dying
if I were you. Huh?

79
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:42,209
Huh?

80
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:44,837
Hey, what are you talking about?

81
00:13:46,297 --> 00:13:47,798
Kang Woojin.

82
00:13:48,591 --> 00:13:49,759
Woojin?

83
00:13:49,842 --> 00:13:54,555
Yeah, you guys had him tail Oh Jinseop.

84
00:13:56,015 --> 00:13:57,224
He's dead.

85
00:13:59,602 --> 00:14:01,938
You bitch...

86
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:04,231
Aw, damn it.

87
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:06,817
Argh, fuck.

88
00:14:06,901 --> 00:14:10,071
Hey, don't get ahead of yourself, now.

89
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:16,202
Ah, shit...

90
00:14:17,495 --> 00:14:19,205
Hey, what did you just say?

91
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,085
Say it again.

92
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,798
This time, it'll be your head.

93
00:14:31,634 --> 00:14:33,552
Did you know...

94
00:14:34,887 --> 00:14:38,599
...that Oh Jinseop
is the corpse art killer?

95
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,477
He's a killer?

96
00:14:44,605 --> 00:14:46,107
Yeah, stupid.

97
00:14:48,609 --> 00:14:49,944
Oh Jinseop

98
00:14:51,445 --> 00:14:53,114
killed Kang Woojin too.

99
00:14:57,576 --> 00:14:59,495
You, check on it
and bring back Oh Jinseop.

100
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:00,579
Yes, sir.

101
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:07,420
I'll believe it when I see it.

102
00:15:09,797 --> 00:15:11,507
Where's that eyeball
we've been looking for?

103
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:19,181
Huh?

104
00:15:22,685 --> 00:15:25,146
Hey, hey, hey, what's up with you? Huh?

105
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,488
Monster.

106
00:15:36,824 --> 00:15:37,742
"Monster"?

107
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:43,622
You're a Connect, huh?

108
00:15:43,706 --> 00:15:44,999
A Connect!

109
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,543
You're a walking paycheck!

110
00:15:48,836 --> 00:15:50,212
So what are you gonna do?

111
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:55,885
Is that why you've been spying on us?

112
00:15:56,886 --> 00:15:58,971
Cause you think we've caught your friends?

113
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:01,557
Right?

114
00:16:04,143 --> 00:16:05,186
Aw, hell...

115
00:16:09,732 --> 00:16:10,816
Damn...

116
00:16:21,494 --> 00:16:22,620
Shit.

117
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:29,251
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

118
00:16:29,794 --> 00:16:30,920
What?

119
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:34,548
Chase her discreetly.

120
00:16:35,424 --> 00:16:37,802
Imagine how many of her kind
we could get using her as bait.

121
00:16:38,761 --> 00:16:41,514
We have to catch them all at once.

122
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:55,694
You'll have to find someone else
to work for you.

123
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,198
I don't think I can.

124
00:17:02,076 --> 00:17:03,869
I can't come here anymore.

125
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:19,718
I'm sorry, it's all my fault.

126
00:17:29,687 --> 00:17:32,982
Um, may I borrow your truck?

127
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:38,112
I'll probably drop them off
at a hospital or something,

128
00:17:39,655 --> 00:17:41,740
and I'll come back to return the truck.

129
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,179
Dongsoo.

130
00:18:15,858 --> 00:18:17,359
I'll do it.

131
00:18:19,945 --> 00:18:20,946
What?

132
00:18:23,574 --> 00:18:29,163
I'll clean up here.
Get to where you're going.

133
00:18:31,415 --> 00:18:33,125
Don't get hurt,

134
00:18:34,418 --> 00:18:35,878
and don't get caught.

135
00:18:37,213 --> 00:18:39,089
Hurry up and go.

136
00:18:44,428 --> 00:18:45,638
Sir...

137
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:22,174
Thank you so much for everything.

138
00:19:58,877 --> 00:20:01,297
The water's not even ankle deep,

139
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,508
so there's no way the body
could have floated down here.

140
00:20:05,801 --> 00:20:11,223
So this must be where he was killed
and discarded.

141
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:15,811
His driver's license confirms his name
is Kang Woojin.

142
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,106
The first witness statements
and reports will be written up

143
00:20:19,189 --> 00:20:22,818
and sent as soon as we're done
investigating the crime scene.

144
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:25,738
Huh? There's a camera here.

145
00:20:26,405 --> 00:20:29,616
Oh, send it over quick
and get the data checked.

146
00:20:33,954 --> 00:20:36,832
For all a Connect's amazing abilities,

147
00:20:36,915 --> 00:20:41,086
ultimately, you just end up losing
those dear to you.

148
00:20:43,172 --> 00:20:44,548
Is that what you think?

149
00:20:46,675 --> 00:20:49,678
If I hadn't interfered...

150
00:20:52,097 --> 00:20:54,683
Z wouldn't have been attacked.

151
00:20:56,268 --> 00:20:59,688
Z only got mixed into this
because he approached first.

152
00:21:02,066 --> 00:21:03,776
You did nothing wrong.

153
00:21:10,074 --> 00:21:13,327
Maybe if we'd met through music,

154
00:21:16,288 --> 00:21:19,750
we could've been friends.

155
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:26,048
I've been hiding who I am all my life
because I'm different.

156
00:21:28,967 --> 00:21:31,220
But there are things that only I can do.

157
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,599
Detective!

158
00:21:36,975 --> 00:21:40,062
I'm the only one who knows
the faces of the kids he's gonna kill.

159
00:21:42,689 --> 00:21:46,485
I got carried away, thinking

160
00:21:47,903 --> 00:21:49,988
I'd do anything to save other people.

161
00:21:56,203 --> 00:21:57,663
I shouldn't have done that.

162
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,710
Get a grip!

163
00:22:05,212 --> 00:22:08,215
You were willing to become an arsonist
to save a bunch of kids.

164
00:22:09,216 --> 00:22:10,217
That's...

165
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,971
You're not the one to blame.
That bastard is.

166
00:22:20,227 --> 00:22:21,437
Ha Dongsoo,

167
00:22:23,105 --> 00:22:24,731
do you hate that you have a superior body

168
00:22:24,815 --> 00:22:29,528
that doesn't die after getting stabbed
with a knife, unlike everyone else?

169
00:22:53,427 --> 00:22:56,472
IRANG A new type of human,
born as the freak of the century.

170
00:22:57,431 --> 00:22:59,141
Connect is the neo-human.

171
00:23:05,772 --> 00:23:08,233
It's only right to call
the others old-humans.

172
00:23:08,984 --> 00:23:13,780
The old-humans either fear us
and call us monsters,

173
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:19,161
or try to possess our bodies.

174
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:23,707
You've agonized over your ability
and lived in hiding.

175
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:26,752
You probably want to keep it that way.

176
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,256
But I'm different.

177
00:23:33,675 --> 00:23:40,432
Once I found out I was a Connect
and started gathering information,

178
00:23:41,225 --> 00:23:44,561
I learned about
how extraordinary we all are.

179
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:50,692
If the world can't accept us,
we need to change it.

180
00:23:52,569 --> 00:23:57,783
We have to conquer the world
and rule over it.

181
00:24:02,162 --> 00:24:03,622
Rule over it?

182
00:24:05,874 --> 00:24:10,254
A superior race of evolved humans ruling
over the world is the right thing.

183
00:24:15,926 --> 00:24:19,054
Will that even work? Just you and me?

184
00:24:21,056 --> 00:24:22,474
It's not just the two of us.

185
00:24:27,271 --> 00:24:29,106
There are other Connects?

186
00:24:30,524 --> 00:24:32,025
You'll meet them soon.

The meeting location
and time have changed.

197
00:25:42,554 --> 00:25:44,264
I have to go save Z

198
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:47,934
and get my right eye back.

199
00:25:48,518 --> 00:25:50,520
Make sure to end him.

200
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:53,815
What about you?

201
00:25:54,358 --> 00:25:55,692
I have a prior engagement.

202
00:25:56,485 --> 00:25:59,029
Whoever finishes first
should call the other.

203
00:26:02,282 --> 00:26:03,617
I understand.

204
00:26:05,535 --> 00:26:07,996
Oh, the memory chip data from the camera

205
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,498
found in the irrigation channel
has been recovered,

206
00:26:09,581 --> 00:26:11,041
-and it's loaded in the computer.
-Oh, yeah?

207
00:26:11,124 --> 00:26:12,125
-Yes, sir. Kyunghun.
-Sir.

208
00:26:12,209 --> 00:26:13,710
-Play it.
-Yes, sir.

209
00:26:15,921 --> 00:26:17,464
It's up, sir.

210
00:26:28,225 --> 00:26:31,228
It's all Oh Jinseop.

211
00:26:31,353 --> 00:26:32,646
Yes.

212
00:26:33,355 --> 00:26:35,440
-But, you know...
-Yeah.

213
00:26:35,524 --> 00:26:39,152
If you look at the dates here,
wasn't he being stalked

214
00:26:39,236 --> 00:26:42,906
while the corpse art murders
were taking place?

215
00:26:46,118 --> 00:26:50,455
Oh, and there was
an anonymous call earlier.

216
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:51,665
Yeah.

217
00:26:52,374 --> 00:26:54,668
Ever heard of that famous artist, Z?

218
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:55,877
Yeah, I have.

219
00:26:57,129 --> 00:26:59,464
He's been abducted.

220
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:02,592
Abducted?

221
00:27:02,676 --> 00:27:07,222
Yes, the caller was struck with something
before she could see the assailant's face,

222
00:27:07,305 --> 00:27:11,518
but what she heard the abductor say
"stealing someone else's song,"

223
00:27:11,601 --> 00:27:14,521
before she fell unconscious.

224
00:27:22,487 --> 00:27:25,323
Ha Dongsoo, Oh Jinseop...

225
00:27:27,576 --> 00:27:29,244
This is a proper storm.

Why is he moving so fast all of a sudden?

233
00:31:59,264 --> 00:32:01,099

240
00:32:43,183 --> 00:32:44,392
Are you awake?

241
00:32:47,437 --> 00:32:49,564
Corpse art killer...

242
00:32:50,315 --> 00:32:57,238
I wasn't going to name it anything silly,
but people seem to like it.

243
00:32:58,782 --> 00:33:03,661
Why are you taking this so far?
Is killing people that fun?

244
00:33:04,829 --> 00:33:06,748
People are destined to die, aren't they?

245
00:33:07,499 --> 00:33:09,000
Immortality isn't an option,

246
00:33:09,084 --> 00:33:12,629
and the only thing humans
can choose is how they die.

247
00:33:12,712 --> 00:33:13,713
That's it.

248
00:33:13,797 --> 00:33:15,965
That's how I've always thought of it.

249
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,303
They say you're sick.

250
00:33:23,056 --> 00:33:25,058
You're gonna die soon, too.

251
00:33:26,267 --> 00:33:27,852
Well, thanks to that, I had an epiphany,

252
00:33:27,936 --> 00:33:34,317
and decided to have a beautiful death
while creating beautiful things.

253
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,612
You can die on your own.
Why drag other people into it?

254
00:33:38,404 --> 00:33:40,907
No man is an island.

255
00:33:41,699 --> 00:33:46,204
Animal or plant,
everything devours everything else.

256
00:33:47,497 --> 00:33:50,083
If beauty belongs to life and the living,

257
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:54,587
what's so wrong
about a life consuming another?

258
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:57,674
You really are a freak.

259
00:34:00,135 --> 00:34:02,220
Honestly, before meeting you,

260
00:34:02,303 --> 00:34:06,558
I was bored
with everything besides killing.

261
00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:13,273
But you're bored too
with that immortal body of yours.

262
00:34:13,356 --> 00:34:16,651
That's why you care so much
about other people dying, no?

263
00:34:29,372 --> 00:34:32,000
Argh, damn it!

264
00:34:36,921 --> 00:34:40,967
Is it a coincidence
that you appeared in my life?

265
00:34:43,386 --> 00:34:44,762
Or is it fate?

266
00:34:46,097 --> 00:34:48,558
You can take that fate and shove it.

267
00:34:48,641 --> 00:34:53,021
Why did I receive your eye for transplant?

268
00:34:53,813 --> 00:34:57,400
It was a mistake made
by organ-trafficking fucks.

269
00:34:57,483 --> 00:34:58,943
Purely by chance.

270
00:35:01,946 --> 00:35:04,908
If I took every part of your body,
can I call it mine?

271
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,328
Is it "you"?

272
00:35:10,496 --> 00:35:13,583
Or is it "me"?

273
00:35:15,001 --> 00:35:18,171
Or should we call it "we"?

274
00:35:20,423 --> 00:35:24,177
Stop spewing nonsense
and get out of my head!
