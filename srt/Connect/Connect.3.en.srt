Where is that coat? You bastard.

00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:37,439
What's your problem?

25
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:40,358
I don't have a coat, okay?

Ugh, shit, you bastard. Murderer!

00:04:45,048 --> 00:04:47,467
Hey, you crazy bastard!

32
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,261
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yes, sir. Here, here, here.

33
00:04:50,345 --> 00:04:53,431
Oh, it's not me.
Damn it, it's not me! Let go, let go!

34
00:04:53,515 --> 00:04:55,058
Come on, sir, let go of me!

35
00:04:55,141 --> 00:04:56,476
-Stay still!
-Stay still.

36
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:58,395
Sir!

37
00:04:59,562 --> 00:05:02,190
Trespassing and assault weren't
enough, you pervert?

38
00:05:02,273 --> 00:05:03,191
Oh, boy.

39
00:05:03,274 --> 00:05:06,903
Damn it, that's not it. Let go of me.
Just let go, come on!

40
00:05:06,986 --> 00:05:09,072
-What do you mean "let go"?
-Please stay still, okay?

41
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:22,627
Come out!

42
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:26,506
Come out, you son of a bitch!
It was this asshole here!

43
00:05:31,594 --> 00:05:33,721
-Sir, please!
-Relax or you'll get hurt.

44
00:05:33,805 --> 00:05:36,141
Move aside, please.

45
00:05:36,224 --> 00:05:37,517
You're making a mistake.

46
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,601
If you got something to say,

47
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:39,769
you can talk about it
at the police station.

48
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:42,272
Let me just see his face, his face.
I just need to see his face!

49
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:44,149
Whose face are you trying to see?

50
00:05:54,742 --> 00:05:58,621
That murderer... Sir, please,
it wasn't me. It really wasn't me.

51
00:05:58,705 --> 00:06:00,665
-What wouldn't it be you?
-Go tell the police.

52
00:06:00,748 --> 00:06:02,167
The door is closing.

53
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,627
Eye patch...

54
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:10,049
It was you, wasn't it?

55
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,301
What...

56
00:06:13,178 --> 00:06:15,930
No, it wasn't me. It wasn't me.

57
00:06:16,014 --> 00:06:17,682
You're the man
who's been following Sunhee!

58
00:06:17,765 --> 00:06:20,059
-That's you!
-Whoa, what are you doing?

59
00:06:20,894 --> 00:06:22,061
Oh, come on.

60
00:06:23,313 --> 00:06:24,731
What is this?

61
00:06:26,232 --> 00:06:27,275
Damn it.

62
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:33,364
-Look, he's got no eye.
-His eye, it's...

63
00:06:33,448 --> 00:06:35,783
Why doesn't he have that eye?

64
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:36,993
There's another dead person?

65
00:06:37,076 --> 00:06:39,662
Yes. I found her on the rooftop.
I already called the police.

66
00:06:41,623 --> 00:06:44,375
It's not me, it's not me.
He's over there in the stall. Fuck!

67
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:46,878
He's got my eye, that, that bastard!

68
00:06:46,961 --> 00:06:48,630
Cut the crap.

69
00:06:48,796 --> 00:06:54,052
Hey, you son of a bitch! Wherever you are,
I'll find you and come after you!

70
00:06:57,847 --> 00:06:59,682
Corpse art.

71
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:05,688
So, he knows about me?
But he doesn't know my face.

72
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:12,070
How is that possible?

73
00:07:15,114 --> 00:07:17,242
What's wrong? What happened?

74
00:07:17,825 --> 00:07:19,994
It seems like Myeonghun fell down.

75
00:07:20,078 --> 00:07:21,204
What?

76
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:23,122
Myeonghun?

77
00:07:24,457 --> 00:07:27,377
Ugh, it's so gross, damn it.

78
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,138
1 WELCOME

79
00:07:39,222 --> 00:07:41,224
It was you?

80
00:07:42,016 --> 00:07:44,936
Well, he's been hanging
around the building lately.

81
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:46,771
I did think it was odd.

82
00:07:46,854 --> 00:07:48,606
Can we please go peacefully?

83
00:08:19,762 --> 00:08:21,764
Glad to see me again, right?

84
00:08:47,248 --> 00:08:48,416
They say the eye patch man

85
00:08:48,499 --> 00:08:51,669
has been roaming around the company
these past few days.

86
00:08:53,254 --> 00:08:54,422
There were company employees

87
00:08:54,505 --> 00:08:56,924
who testified that he's been stalking
the deceased Lee Sunhee.

88
00:09:01,346 --> 00:09:05,099
Why was he following Lee Sunhee around?

89
00:09:06,684 --> 00:09:08,186
But if the eye patch man

90
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:10,063
killed Hwang Myeonghun and Lee Sunhee,

91
00:09:10,146 --> 00:09:13,858
then the timeline doesn't
make sense if you take a look at this.

92
00:09:14,317 --> 00:09:17,070
Because the eye patch man entered
this building

93
00:09:17,153 --> 00:09:21,491
after Hwang Myeonghun fell
from the rooftop and died.

94
00:09:25,286 --> 00:09:28,748
What about that woman who helped him?

95
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,167
-Please show us the entrance gate footage.
-Yes, sir.

96
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:34,379
Apparently, she entered a few minutes

97
00:09:34,462 --> 00:09:37,173
-after the eye patch man entered.
-Ah...

98
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,926
This woman took the employee badge

99
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:43,513
from the bathroom
outside the gate over there.

100
00:09:48,393 --> 00:09:52,605
Wherever you are,
I'll find you and come after you!

101
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:56,901
But how?

102
00:10:28,641 --> 00:10:29,767
The transplant?

103
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:37,024
This does not make sense.

104
00:10:41,028 --> 00:10:42,572
And yet it does.

105
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:54,584
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

106
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:58,755
-Are you Team Leader Oh Jinseop?
-Yes.

107
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:00,006
Uh...

108
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:07,180
Do you have time to answer
a few questions?

109
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:13,895
Yes.

110
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:15,980
Okay.

111
00:11:19,442 --> 00:11:21,486
By any chance, do you recognize this man?

112
00:11:21,569 --> 00:11:22,820
Yes.

113
00:11:27,283 --> 00:11:29,118
He made that much ruckus,

114
00:11:29,202 --> 00:11:30,870
so it'd be weird
if I didn't recognize him.

115
00:11:31,621 --> 00:11:32,663
Ah...

116
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:37,168
Ah, I see. All right.

117
00:11:37,251 --> 00:11:39,337
Well, while we're on the topic...

118
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:44,967
while he was causing that ruckus,
where were you watching from?

119
00:11:45,676 --> 00:11:47,178
The hallway.

120
00:11:47,261 --> 00:11:50,848
What was he shouting
while causing the ruckus?

121
00:11:51,808 --> 00:11:55,353
He said thief,
or something like that, I think.

122
00:11:55,436 --> 00:11:56,395
Thief?

123
00:11:57,688 --> 00:12:01,484
Did he shout "something" thief?

124
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:03,277
I'm not sure about the details...

125
00:12:03,361 --> 00:12:05,404
I heard he said something
like "eyeball thief."

126
00:12:07,615 --> 00:12:09,534
What's the point of this?

127
00:12:09,617 --> 00:12:12,245
Why would you ask when you already know?

128
00:12:14,205 --> 00:12:15,331
Oh...

129
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,335
For now,

130
00:12:20,837 --> 00:12:22,380
I do not know.

131
00:12:26,342 --> 00:12:31,389
I remember Sunhee telling Jiyoung
that a man missing an eyeball

132
00:12:32,223 --> 00:12:35,142
and wearing an eye patch
was following her around.

133
00:12:37,603 --> 00:12:39,939
If it's about that, you should ask her...

134
00:12:41,315 --> 00:12:44,068
Ah, I just did check with her.

135
00:12:46,654 --> 00:12:53,286
Ah, Mr. Oh, were you wearing a coat
when you came to work this morning?

136
00:12:53,828 --> 00:12:54,954
A coat?

137
00:12:55,037 --> 00:13:00,626
Uh, I heard the eye patch man
was looking for someone's coat.

138
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:04,922
Could we take a look at your coat?

139
00:13:05,006 --> 00:13:07,008
Uh, wait a minute.

140
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:10,678
What are you doing right now? Huh?

141
00:13:10,761 --> 00:13:12,471
You should be catching the culprit,

142
00:13:12,555 --> 00:13:15,141
but instead, you're asking silly questions
to an innocent person!

143
00:13:15,224 --> 00:13:17,476
You think you can do whatever
you want just because you're cops?

144
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,729
-How could you say something like that?
-I mean...

145
00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:24,025
It's okay, Jiyoung.

146
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,527
The detectives should
keep all possibilities

147
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:30,072
open in their investigation
until they reach the conclusion.

148
00:13:33,117 --> 00:13:35,912
I totally understand
this little bit of disrespect.

149
00:13:38,956 --> 00:13:41,167
Thank you for your understanding.

150
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,169
But, what I want to ask is...

151
00:13:43,252 --> 00:13:44,462
Yes, what is it?

152
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:46,589
What is that tissue for?

153
00:13:47,173 --> 00:13:50,092
Is it to lessen the anxiety on the subject
you're interrogating?

154
00:13:51,469 --> 00:13:55,389
Ah, this... this, ah, yes.

155
00:13:55,473 --> 00:13:59,602
I, uh, had a bit of nosebleed earlier.

156
00:13:59,685 --> 00:14:01,437
Is it still bleeding?

157
00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:01,580
Thanks.

158
00:15:10,006 --> 00:15:11,132
Now, tell me.

159
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:16,220
Who... Who are you?

160
00:15:17,138 --> 00:15:18,472
I'm a novelist.

161
00:15:21,892 --> 00:15:23,019
To be?

162
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:29,150
Well, even if I do become one,
it might be over with just one novel.

163
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:34,280
I just wanted to write about Connect.

164
00:15:36,824 --> 00:15:37,908
Why?

165
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:40,870
I received help from a Connect
when I was young.

166
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:43,873
There was a kid who helped me

167
00:15:43,956 --> 00:15:46,292
when I was about to get hit
by a dump truck.

168
00:15:47,251 --> 00:15:49,128
The kid got hit
by the truck instead of me.

169
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,257
And that kid was a Connect.

170
00:16:05,227 --> 00:16:06,312
Was it a friend?

171
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:11,025
No, I had never seen the kid before.

172
00:16:14,153 --> 00:16:16,697
The kid was crushed under the truck,
and it was brutal.

173
00:16:18,032 --> 00:16:22,203
The truck driver was scared
to death and didn't know what to do,

174
00:16:22,286 --> 00:16:24,413
and then ran away.

175
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:31,128
But surprisingly,

176
00:16:33,672 --> 00:16:35,883
the body of that kid,

177
00:16:43,849 --> 00:16:46,977
was restored in the blink of an eye.

178
00:16:49,021 --> 00:16:50,356
Just like you.

179
00:16:57,321 --> 00:16:59,323
And then the kid just disappeared.

180
00:17:03,327 --> 00:17:08,249
I didn't have time to say thanks,
and no one believed me.

181
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:13,170
So, the incident wasn't reported at
all, as if it never happened.

182
00:17:16,298 --> 00:17:17,716
But I remember.

183
00:17:18,926 --> 00:17:21,470
I remember that kid who cared
to save me that day.

184
00:17:24,765 --> 00:17:28,602
And then one day, I heard an urban legend
about a body that does not die.

185
00:17:33,274 --> 00:17:36,569
That's when I started digging.

186
00:17:41,532 --> 00:17:44,785
What about you?
Do you know who's after you?

187
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:51,750
Aren't they organ traffickers?

188
00:17:52,668 --> 00:17:55,588
That's right, but it looks like
there's a higher organization

189
00:17:55,671 --> 00:17:57,590
that actually does the organ trafficking,

190
00:17:57,673 --> 00:18:00,676
and the ones after you are organ hunters,
who specialize in capturing people.

191
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:03,637
So you were caught by them
and you ran away from them?

192
00:18:10,644 --> 00:18:11,687
Yeah.

193
00:18:12,563 --> 00:18:15,649
DOES ANYONE KNOW

194
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:17,818
AN URBAN LEGEND CALLED CONNECT?

195
00:18:17,902 --> 00:18:20,988
ANYONE?

196
00:18:21,488 --> 00:18:24,909
So, I left a reply comment there,
and I was able to meet them.

197
00:18:24,992 --> 00:18:26,702
This is what I wrote back then.

198
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,331
And then we agreed
to exchange information,

199
00:18:30,414 --> 00:18:32,833
but we had different motives so we
just sounded each other out.

200
00:18:32,917 --> 00:18:35,419
But obviously,
no real information came of it.

201
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,339
I was able to find various information,

202
00:18:38,422 --> 00:18:41,926
through the tapping device
I planted there.

203
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:43,469
Tapping device?

204
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:46,764
From you, a novelist?

205
00:18:49,016 --> 00:18:50,809
Well, it is illegal, but...

206
00:18:51,518 --> 00:18:53,604
they are criminals anyway.

207
00:18:55,272 --> 00:18:57,107
Thanks to that, I learned about you.

208
00:19:02,404 --> 00:19:04,698
So...

209
00:19:04,782 --> 00:19:06,659
What is this Connect?

210
00:19:10,204 --> 00:19:12,081
It's not a simple cut-and-dried story.

211
00:19:13,582 --> 00:19:15,501
Based on the information I collected,

212
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:21,507
they're connected
with Jeongdo Pharmaceuticals.

213
00:19:22,633 --> 00:19:26,178
Jeongdo Pharmaceuticals? You mean...

214
00:19:26,262 --> 00:19:28,722
Right, the number one corporation
in our country.

215
00:19:31,475 --> 00:19:32,643
What is that?

216
00:19:33,936 --> 00:19:36,313
If you're concerned, do you want
to investigate it together?

217
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:43,487
I am concerned, but stopping
the murders is more important right now.

218
00:19:44,863 --> 00:19:45,906
Murder?

219
00:19:49,368 --> 00:19:51,453
When I was abducted,

220
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:58,961
I lost an eye. And that eye was
transplanted to a man...

221
00:20:09,513 --> 00:20:11,223
That bastard has it.

222
00:20:12,224 --> 00:20:13,434
My eye...

223
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,114
Sorry.

224
00:20:29,325 --> 00:20:30,659
But how do you know?

225
00:20:31,285 --> 00:20:33,495
That his eye is yours?

226
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:40,044
Because I had visions.

227
00:20:45,632 --> 00:20:47,843
He's an unbelievable narcissist.

228
00:20:49,511 --> 00:20:50,637
Oh Jinseop?

229
00:20:50,721 --> 00:20:51,805
Yeah.

230
00:20:53,682 --> 00:20:56,018
We were the ones attacking him,

231
00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:59,104
yet he bared his teeth at the one
who's trying to help him.

232
00:20:59,188 --> 00:21:00,272
Huh?

233
00:21:01,607 --> 00:21:02,775
When?

234
00:21:06,653 --> 00:21:08,447
He seemed more annoyed with the woman

235
00:21:09,114 --> 00:21:12,659
who defended him than us
who were interrogating him.

236
00:21:14,078 --> 00:21:17,081
He is triggered
by completely different things

237
00:21:17,164 --> 00:21:18,916
compared to ordinary people.

238
00:21:29,718 --> 00:21:31,470
I've never heard of anything like that.

239
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:36,517
An ability to have vision even after
having the eye transplanted to someone...

240
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:41,897
Well, it's up to you to believe it or not.

241
00:21:42,689 --> 00:21:43,732
What else happens?

242
00:21:44,566 --> 00:21:47,611
You know, thoughts being shared...

243
00:21:50,614 --> 00:21:53,575
Well, it's not really
something like that...

244
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,796
Ah...

245
00:22:29,069 --> 00:22:30,446
Looks better than the eye patch.

246
00:22:32,489 --> 00:22:34,616
Everyone is looking for a man
with an eye patch.

247
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,577
Keep that on whenever you go outside.

248
00:22:49,423 --> 00:22:50,966
Would you like it in a bag?

249
00:22:51,967 --> 00:22:53,677
-Ah...
-Yes.

250
00:22:59,016 --> 00:23:03,604
WANTED FLYER OF MURDER SUSPECT

251
00:23:06,398 --> 00:23:08,275
I, uh, I'll just take it.

252
00:23:09,693 --> 00:23:11,403
I rang up for the bag too...

253
00:23:11,487 --> 00:23:14,448
Oh, please take this.

254
00:23:18,035 --> 00:23:21,163
Man, this is driving me crazy.

255
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:25,834
What's wrong?

256
00:23:29,379 --> 00:23:32,466

Ah, wait.

268
00:24:09,336 --> 00:24:15,217
He's listening to my song.
I think my eye is responding to my song.

269
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,302
What do you mean?

270
00:24:18,512 --> 00:24:21,265
Are you saying that your vision is linked
when he listens to your song?

271
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:26,812
Ah...

272
00:24:30,148 --> 00:24:31,775
The pain is gone.

273
00:24:38,115 --> 00:24:39,491
It's gone.

274
00:24:45,247 --> 00:24:49,167
Do you think he found out?
That you've been watching?

275
00:24:51,003 --> 00:24:52,379
I don't know yet.

276
00:24:53,505 --> 00:24:55,173
If he finds out,

277
00:24:56,341 --> 00:24:57,759
he will come kill you.

278
00:25:03,765 --> 00:25:06,602
Can he really kill me?

279
00:25:08,854 --> 00:25:13,525
He could kill you through social media
if he reveals your face

280
00:25:13,609 --> 00:25:16,194
and your bodily secrets
with a video on the internet.

281
00:25:20,741 --> 00:25:23,368
Keep a low profile for a while,
and let me do the probing.

282
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:26,496
Okay?

283
00:25:43,555 --> 00:25:44,514
Oh my...

284

is all about to go

This life of mine, seriously.

287
00:25:57,194 --> 00:25:58,695
It's like living in hell.

288
00:25:59,488 --> 00:26:01,823
There is nothing good. Oh, goodness.

The thing is, we don't know anything
about his identity either.

320
00:28:20,378 --> 00:28:23,089
There's the royalty issue about lyrics

321
00:28:23,173 --> 00:28:26,885
and the music so we really tried
to look for him, but we couldn't find him.

322
00:28:27,511 --> 00:28:31,348
I heard the copyright fee is going
straight to donation. That is my sound.

323
00:28:32,557 --> 00:28:37,896
Oh, that's a shame. I thought it would
be a perfect fit for our advertisement.

324
00:28:39,523 --> 00:28:43,443
A big corporation is amazed
by a nameless amateur.

325
00:28:43,527 --> 00:28:46,279
That's unbelievable, right?

326
00:28:46,363 --> 00:28:50,200
I think that's why I'm so drawn to him,
an artist who's not swayed by money.

327
00:28:50,575 --> 00:28:53,370
I mean, it even makes me feel happy.

328
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,636
So...

329
00:29:11,847 --> 00:29:17,102
Why are you after the eye patch man?

330
00:29:19,229 --> 00:29:20,897
I said I was just jogging.

331
00:29:23,817 --> 00:29:25,068
For diet.

332
00:29:25,151 --> 00:29:26,653
Enough of that bullshit.

333
00:29:28,071 --> 00:29:32,158
What, someone like you
who looks they loan out small amounts

334
00:29:32,242 --> 00:29:34,411
and take huge interests?

335
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:38,039
Huh? Huh?

336
00:29:48,466 --> 00:29:50,510
You're still doing this?

337
00:29:51,553 --> 00:29:52,679
Let him go.

338
00:29:53,597 --> 00:29:54,598
Detective.

339
00:29:55,098 --> 00:29:56,266
Let him go.

340
00:29:58,393 --> 00:29:59,686
Can I go?

341
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,528
Go.

342
00:30:08,612 --> 00:30:11,239
Go. And don't come back.

343
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:15,118
Get out!

344
00:30:19,122 --> 00:30:20,999
Let's do this the easy way.

345
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:25,003
First, keep that eye patch
man on a tight leash.

346
00:30:33,803 --> 00:30:35,305
It's me, Woojin, sir.

347
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:39,392
Why is it so difficult
to get a hold of you?

348
00:30:40,143 --> 00:30:44,189
You know how important
that money is to us, right?

349
00:30:44,606 --> 00:30:49,110
How about the guy
with the transplanted eye, huh? Woojin?

350
00:30:49,819 --> 00:30:51,321
"Woojin"?

351
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:55,992
Yes, he's doing the regular 9 to 5

352
00:30:56,076 --> 00:30:58,244
like a common office worker.

353
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:03,124
Yeah, okay, keep your eyes wide open
and watch carefully, okay?

354
00:31:06,294 --> 00:31:10,799
Damn it, he was about to die
any moment anyway,

355
00:31:10,882 --> 00:31:14,010
so why did we transplant
the eye to him, huh?

356
00:31:14,094 --> 00:31:15,512
Right?

357
00:31:15,595 --> 00:31:19,349
It's an eye that
can be sold for a high price,

358
00:31:19,432 --> 00:31:22,310
so we should take it
before he's cremated, right?

359
00:31:23,353 --> 00:31:27,190
-He's dying?
-My pretties, where... huh?

360
00:31:27,273 --> 00:31:28,483
What?

361
00:31:29,067 --> 00:31:31,361
The... the baby is gone.

362
00:31:32,946 --> 00:31:34,155
Both of them?

363
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:36,741
No, no, Sodom is here,
but Gomorrah is missing.

364
00:31:37,534 --> 00:31:38,785
Where did it go?

365
00:31:38,868 --> 00:31:40,078
Aw, come on...

366
00:31:40,745 --> 00:31:42,831
What are you doing? Find it!

367
00:31:45,917 --> 00:31:46,960
Ah...

368
00:31:47,043 --> 00:31:49,337
Damn it, where is it?

369
00:31:52,215 --> 00:31:53,466
Huh?

370
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:55,218
It's a tapping device.

371
00:31:55,301 --> 00:31:56,219
Who the fuck dared to...

372
00:31:56,302 --> 00:31:57,637
Come on.

373
00:32:03,476 --> 00:32:06,396
It's her, that novelist bitch.

374
00:32:06,479 --> 00:32:11,026
She said she didn't have enough battery
on her laptop and came over here.

375
00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:12,027
May I plug in to charge here?

376
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:14,988
So she wasn't looking for source material
to write a novel? That was a lie, too?

377
00:32:15,071 --> 00:32:17,949
We should beat that bitch up first, right?

378
00:32:19,576 --> 00:32:25,749
Maybe she knows more
about Connect than we do?

379
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:27,083
FUN, EXCITING, LOSE WEIGHT
DAILY LIFE PERSONAL DEFENSE

380

VIRTUAL TARGET PRACTICE
PICKLEBALL, SPORT FOCUSED EXERCISE

381
00:32:54,152 --> 00:32:56,321
One, two, three, four.

382
00:32:59,115 --> 00:33:01,910
This is where the culprit lives?

383
00:34:09,435 --> 00:34:10,770
WILL DO.
I WILL TURN THEM

384
00:34:10,854 --> 00:34:12,230
INTO MINE.
CLOSE YOUR EYES AND IMAGINE.

385
00:34:12,313 --> 00:34:13,815
FALLEN ANGEL.

386
00:34:13,898 --> 00:34:14,858
SEE
ME.

387
00:34:14,941 --> 00:34:15,984
AND SAY
THAT I'M BEAUTIFUL.

388
00:34:16,067 --> 00:34:18,194
WHY WAS I BORN INTO THIS WORLD?
WHAT WAS I MEANT TO DO IN THIS WORLD?

389
00:34:18,278 --> 00:34:22,949
HUBRIS, REASON ENOUGH TO BE ABANDONED.

390
00:34:35,837 --> 00:34:37,338
He's sick with an illness?

391
00:34:38,756 --> 00:34:41,134
Yeah, that's what they said.

392
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:44,137
That it wouldn't be surprising
if he died any moment.

393
00:34:44,971 --> 00:34:46,264
Then could that...

394
00:34:47,348 --> 00:34:49,017
have a connection with the murders?

395
00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:51,895
I heard your song.

396
00:34:52,645 --> 00:34:53,730
It was nice.

397
00:34:55,064 --> 00:34:57,025
Ah...

398
00:34:57,108 --> 00:35:01,362
Oh, not the original,
but Z's arranged version.

399
00:35:04,157 --> 00:35:05,533
I guessed so, too.

400
00:35:05,617 --> 00:35:07,994
Just kidding.

401
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:15,585
What's wrong?

402
00:35:16,169 --> 00:35:19,797
You don't have to be so dramatic.

403
00:35:19,881 --> 00:35:21,507
I said I was kidding.

404
00:35:31,059 --> 00:35:33,353
I can see myself.

405
00:35:33,436 --> 00:35:34,479
What?

406
00:35:38,983 --> 00:35:41,903
Me? What? Why?

407
00:35:58,878 --> 00:36:02,423
THIS TIME I WILL COME FIND YOU.

408
00:36:02,507 --> 00:36:06,344
YOU CAN LOOK FORWARD TO IT.

409
00:36:06,427 --> 00:36:08,805
That bastard...

410
00:36:08,888 --> 00:36:11,683
That bastard is toying with me.
That son of a bitch.

411
00:36:54,058 --> 00:36:56,436
He's even announcing
the next murder.

412
00:36:59,522 --> 00:37:01,441
He knows you're connected.
