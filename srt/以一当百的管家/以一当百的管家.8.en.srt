2020 FIRST HALF
OUTSTANDING RESIDENT AWARD CEREMONY

3
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,750
Here I go. Two, three!

4
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:45,546
One more time. One, two, three!

5
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,214
Okay.

6
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:50,593
-Again. I closed my eyes.
-It's better that way.

7
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,388
-Stop it, Mom. How many do you need?
-Oh, child.

8
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:58,476
How can we stop?
With a child like you in front of us.

9
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,936
We are so proud of you.

10
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:06,776
Your grandma has
no illness to worry about anymore.

11
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:10,529
-The doctor will treat me for everything.
-Of course.

12
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,240
Let's not go over the top, please.

13
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:18,162
There's no one else that took a day off
just to be here like us.

14
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:21,457
Same with you two.
Closing your shop just to be here?

15
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,000
"Outstanding Resident Award."

16
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,919
-First Half.
-"First Half."

17
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,797
I wouldn't complain
if I had as successful a son.

18
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,423
Mom, just get ready to move.

19
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:32,301
I'll buy you an apartment in <i>Gangnam </i>soon.

20
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,303
And about 10 billion won on top of that.

21
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:37,932
-Oh boy.
-All you do is talk.

22
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:42,019
You've haven't earned a single penny yet!

23
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,647
I'm sure Hyang-bok will come through soon.

24
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,901
-Mother, how about <i>Jeongabok </i>today?
-No, you two should go back to work.

25
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,569
We should eat together.

26
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:52,655
It's Bok-soon's favorite place.

27
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:55,032
As expected
of Bongsu District's Choi Su-jong.

28
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,284
No wonder they had a child this late.

29
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:02,706
Like mother, like daughter!

30
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:04,041
Mommy, I'm hungry.

31
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,586
Oh, my sweet little child.

32
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:12,258
You are such a blessing to us all.
You're growing up so fast!

33
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,178
Tae-hee<i>, </i>you'll keep
your promise this time, right?

34
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:19,139
-Yep.
-For real?

35
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:20,349
If you behave well.

36
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,184
Come on.

37
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:24,728
Okay. You got something on your face.

38
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:28,357
I guess this is my luck.
Let me just take pictures for you.

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,360
-The two of you. Mom, come over here.
-Okay.

40
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:34,446
-Here we go.
-How nice.

41
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,494
One, two three.

42
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,497
One more time.

43
00:02:43,873 --> 00:02:46,333
Smile! One, two, three!

44
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:52,590
EP 8.
THE BROKEN PROMISE

45
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:00,472
It's bigger, cleaner, and nicer
than I thought it would be.

46
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:05,394
You thought it would stink
because it's just men?

47
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,939
-Yes.
-We mop and wipe every single day.

48
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,654
-What is that?
-Macarons.

49
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:20,784
One second.

50
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,463
Should I kill him?

51
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:44,975
Should I kill him for you?

52
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,521
I'll kill him. Just say the word.

53
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:50,981
I'll go right now and--

54
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,617
Let's do this some other time.

55
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:37,778
I'm always uninvited, huh.

56
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,411
-It's not like that.
-What isn't like that?

57
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:48,330
Do you know that

58
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,334
you're really good
at driving people crazy?

59
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:55,004
It just doesn't make any sense to me.

60
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,840
Why do you have to be
the one carrying the cross?

61
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,676
Why did this have to happen to us?

62
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,556
-It's my problem.
-Why is that your problem?!

63
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,349
You didn't do anything!

64
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,659
<i>Your call could not be completed.</i>
<i>Please try again later.</i>

65
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,235
BONGSU MARKET

66
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,221
Tae-hee…

67
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:32,768
Tae-hee…

68
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,298
<i>I want him to die.</i>

69
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,009
I'll do it.

70
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:49,178
I'll go kill him right now.

71
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:51,263
You know that it's not hard.

72
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,224
Sure.

73
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:57,728
Go ahead.

74
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:01,565
Kill him.

75
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,234
If it'll undo what happened.

76
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:07,821
If it fixes everything
from start to finish,

77
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,616
go kill him.

78
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,661
Right now.

79
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,685
-Where are you--
-You're up early.

80
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,897
Where are you headed this early?

81
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,861
To exercise. I figured I needed to.

82
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:13,322
Good for you.

83
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:20,620
Dong-joo<i>.</i>

84
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:23,832
It's okay.

85
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,003
Never mind.

86
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,929
What's the occasion?
You usually never come.

87
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,973
You told me to exercise.

88
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,976
I'm going on a diet
to become super pretty.

89
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:44,311
Why so suddenly?

90
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:48,315
You wouldn't know these feelings
even if I told you.

91
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,818
Wonder if there really is something.

92
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,406
There's a guy I like. Don't tell anyone.

93
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,242
-Not you. Dong-joo.
-Oh.

94
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,788
It's not like that house
is the only house in Seoul.

95
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,623
Why would she go back to his house?

96
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,501
I don't know about Dong-joo,

97
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,336
but for me,

98
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:12,589
I would do anything for that man.

99
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:16,468
-I'm a lap ahead of you now.
-Wow.

100
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,055
Do you mean that though?

101
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,598
Mean what?

102
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,850
Really, anything for him?

103
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,143
Like…

104
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:26,937
<i>Should I kill him for you?</i>

105
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,398
I'll kill him.

106
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,525
Killing someone, maybe?

107
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:38,240
I don't know about killing,

108
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:43,078
but probably enough to die for him.
At least, I feel like it.

109
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,457
-Why? Is there someone like that?
-Not at all.

110
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,253
-You're being suspicious.
-I said there isn't.

111
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:57,175
Not sure who it is,
but it sounds like crazy love.

112
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:58,927
Huh?

113
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,972
Did you want to kill Byeong-su
when he broke up with you?

114
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:04,933
No, not at all.

115
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,228
Or would you be able to die for Byeong-su?

116
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,063
No, right?

117
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:15,026
It's not that simple. Not everyone
is able to live or die for love.

118
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,282
I told you. It's not like that.

119
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,242
Aren't you guys going to exercise?

120
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:25,245
She has "it's like that"
written all over her face.

121
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,207
I would've never guessed
you've never dated before.

122
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,169
I would've never guessed
you've never dated either.

123
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,309
What's the occasion? You're cleaning.

124
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,855
I saw macarons inside.
Where'd you get them?

125
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:56,776
Someone gave them to me.

126
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,321
Who? Who did?

127
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,824
Who could it be?

128
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:05,869
-Who could have given you macarons?
-Stop it.

129
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:09,998
-What is this? Stop that, you're weird.
-<i>Hey you two</i>, good morning.

130
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,791
-If it isn't Seo Hae-an!
-Hey.

131
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,085
-You look terrible!
-Did you just get off work?

132
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:16,338
Yeah. It's killing me.

133
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,882
Benjamin Franklin once said,

134
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,968
"In this world, nothing is certain
except death and taxes."

135
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:25,931
Always keep that in mind.
Your paycheck comes out of my taxes.

136
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,683
Man, I'm so sick and tired of that.

137
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,937
Don't you know that
civil officers hate hearing that the most?

138
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,691
I heard it twice last night.
Some old guy pissing on a power pole

139
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:41,446
and a drunk as he demanded
I drive him home in a police car.

140
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,032
I see. My bad!

141
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:47,953
He says he's tired, let him go rest.
What are you doing keeping him here?

142
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,580
Wow, Tae-hee is the best.

143
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:54,084
Yep, I'm going now.

144
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,669
-Alright. Rest well.
-Will do.

145
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,212
-Good work today.
-Thanks.

146
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:01,091
Oh, right.
You don't have much to do today, right?

147
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,096
Why a church?

148
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:09,933
-Tae-hee, do you remember?
-What?

149
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:15,647
The day I missed the last bus ending
my 15 years of studying for the bar exam.

150
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,234
The day I bombed the CPA exam due to
oriental nerve calming pill overdose.

151
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,569
Was it the appraiser exam?

152
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,031
The day I got sick from boiled squid and
was in the Bongsu Middle bathroom all day.

153
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:26,825
What else…

154
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:31,663
Anyways, on the days of despair,
the very difficult days,

155
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,250
I would always come here.

156
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,334
Get to the point.

157
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:37,460
It didn't do much.

158
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,590
My wishes are never granted.
Not even a considered.

159
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:46,177
Among the 8 billion humans on Earth,
I must be the last in line.

160
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:50,932
Grant everyone else's wishes first,
and then maybe mine.

161
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:54,978
Anyways, that's why
your uncle stopped going to church.

162
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:59,649
Did you bring me here in this heat
to have this meaningless monologue?

163
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,027
Tae-hee. This church is

164
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,029
not a place you come to pray.

165
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,584
The countdown has started.

166
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:20,211
There are nine people left.

167
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,172
The end is in sight.

168
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,132
It is.

169
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:27,677
Is first love

170
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:29,804
<i>that </i>amazing?

171
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:33,892
First love, you say?

172
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:43,151
"Faith, hope, and love.
But the greatest of these is first love."

173
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:46,279
It was the year 1995.

174
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,241
The day the HeoDongTaek trio
won the Basketball Festival.

175
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:54,079
I was on my way to study hall,
when a Kyeongshim Girl's High--

176
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:01,920
A Kyeongshim Girl's High School student
drops her bus ticket

177
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:05,131
and it lands right at my feet.
Just like fate.

178
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:10,804
It was a little different from the feeling
when I first met our heavenly father.

179
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,305
How do I say this?

180
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,768
That pink bus ticket was
flying in the wind like a flower petal--

181
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,979
Would first love returning sway hearts?

182
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:25,694
No! I will not be swayed.
I am married to God.

183
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:27,779
I would never.

184
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,448
-Not you, Father.
-Then who?

185
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,909
Which first love do you mean?

186
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:40,583
You have to ask properly
for me to answer properly.

187
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,921
What is it that
you want to ask and find out?

188
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:46,923
Nothing.

189
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,346
If you are curious
about a man's first love--

190
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,014
Why would I be curious about that?

191
00:16:56,182 --> 00:17:00,311
By chance, did someone's first love
suddenly come back--

192
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:01,896
I said it's not like that.

193
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,608
By any chance,

194
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,987
If you want to know
about a man's first love…

195
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,283
let it go.

196
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,452
Let it go, for him.

197
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,662
No reason to get into it.

198
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:19,914
It's a Pandora's box.

199
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:25,754
But then…

200
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:31,134
What should I do about my heart
that keeps wanting to know and open it?

201
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:35,138
This is killing me.

202
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,058
Alright.

203
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,603
Hey, Stella. Look.

204
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:45,190
Do not ever dig up a man's first love.

205
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,984
If you do, it hurts.

206
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,945
It hurts you, and it hurts that person.

207
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:53,031
You have to do this for him.

208
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,116
You don't know first love, right?

209
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,747
Let me tell you the rest of my story.

210
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,958
-He was better than I imagined.
-Who was?

211
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,378
Brother nephew that I saw the other day.

212
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:12,342
You said he gives you a hard time,
so I thought he was like a demon.

213
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,344
He was actually pretty decent.

214
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,304
Is he doing well?

215
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:17,889
Probably.

216
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:19,224
See you.

217
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,267
What about lunch?

218
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:24,854
-I don't have an appetite. It's too hot.
-It's a special meal today.

219
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,398
<i>Jeyuk ssambap.</i>

220
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:32,487
Why today?

221
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:44,457
My, I'm glad to see
you found some time to visit.

222
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,418
It is very nice to see you again here.

223
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,380
-Of course.
-Wow, Father.

224
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,507
This <i>jeyukbokkeum </i>is amazing!

225
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:56,177
This is truly a Godsend meal.
A magical dish!

226
00:18:56,928 --> 00:19:01,391
For a man from The Republic of Korea,
two bowls of rice is nothing with this.

227
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,269
Three bowls, easily!

228
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,980
Brother nephew, have a good meal.

229
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,357
-Thank you.
-Of course.

230
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,122
A bachelor, right?

231
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,292
Correct. I haven't married yet.

232
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:30,628
-Oh, it's not that I wasn't able to.
-Right.

233
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,841
Then how about a spouse prayer?

234
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,595
I don't need anything like that.

235
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:42,265
I actually declared non-maritalism.

236
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:44,851
I see.

237
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,520
Aren't you also reminded that

238
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,398
he always smells like soap?

239
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,817
Maybe it's the weather.

240
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:56,362
I'm reminded of my first love,
just like <i>A Young Zelkova</i>--

241
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,450
Wow. Father, did you have a first love?

242
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:05,246
Of course I did.
Even Sister over there had one.

243
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,833
Love is always good, isn't it?

244
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:12,921
Love is sharing.

245
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,633
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

246
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:23,181
Kid, eat like you mean it!

247
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,059
Put that meat on the rice.

248
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,608
Oh man, I'm so full.

249
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,861
Father, it was a great meal. Thank you.

250
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:40,698
I was always getting by with
<i>ramyeon </i>and delivery food.

251
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:44,494
I really feel revitalized
after that meal today.

252
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,373
You are so nice to say that.

253
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,588
You're leaving so soon.

254
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,302
Here it comes.

255
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:05,056
Father, who are these kids?

256
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:09,686
Oh. We are running an after-school program
for our church members' children.

257
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,230
Writing, calligraphy,

258
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,565
flute, violin, and more.

259
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:17,360
All by our brothers and sisters'
talent donations.

260
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,486
In that case,

261
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,781
-take and use me whenever you need to.
-Pardon?

262
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,033
I'm good at pretty much everything.

263
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,620
<i>Baduk, </i>ukulele, guitar, gaming.
And, of course,

264
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,957
-viral dances too.
-What are you doing?

265
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,333
-Stop it.
-I used to be

266
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,335
known as the <i>Nokdu </i>Street hermit.

267
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:37,755
Wow. So it is true that
when you study for a long time,

268
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,465
you become good at many things.

269
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:41,634
You know very well, Father.

270
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,928
Anyways, please call whenever.

271
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:47,765
As CEO of A Dime A Job,
I must also contribute to God's love.

272
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,935
We are blessed to have you.

273
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:52,228
Father!

274
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:54,772
Sister.
What brings you here at this time?

275
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:56,983
I brought some ice cream for the kids.

276
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,568
Such kindness every time.

277
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:02,905
John's mom bought pizza, Mary's mom
<i>Tteokbokki, </i>and Samuel's mom burgers.

278
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,366
I couldn't stand still.
This is all I can do.

279
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:07,827
-Thank you very much.
-No problem.

280
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,455
Children, ice cream is here!

281
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:17,253
-Wow, how nice.
-One at a time, guys.

282
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,172
Slow down. Pick one.

283
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,759
-Give it here!
-Joseph, aren't you getting some?

284
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:26,137
-Can Joseph have one too?
-Of course, here.

285
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,314
BONGRYEONG ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
BAEK DONG-JOO

286
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:38,316
BONGRYEONG ELEMENTARY FEMALE TABLE TENNIS

287
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:40,943
-Oh, welcome!
-Hello, Coach.

288
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:44,947
-What is all this?
-Ho-yeon.

289
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:46,699
-Mom!
-Girls, snack time.

290
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:00,880
Dong-joo!

291
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,381
YOO SO-RA

292
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:05,343
You have to pick fast.

293
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,435
I had this before when I went to
a water park with my dad.

294
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,270
I did while camping before.

295
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:19,982
You've gone camping before?
I will too, when dad gets a day off.

296
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,193
Putting up a tent is really hard.

297
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:26,322
Two hours, three hours,
four hours, five hours!

298
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:30,326
Oh, I saw an elk and a boar too.

299
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,537
-Really?
-They come out at night.

300
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,747
'Cause it's really dark at night.

301
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:37,166
Really? Maybe I'll see an elk then.

302
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,669
Lucky.

303
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:44,048
-Do mosquitoes come into the tent?
-Of course they do…

304
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:45,883
<i>I'll take you.</i>

305
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:48,594
<i>-Where?</i>
<i>-To see stars.</i>

306
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,430
<i>-For real this time.</i>
<i>-Really?</i>

307
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:54,350
<i>Promise.</i>

308
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:06,487
I had no idea, Il-seob.

309
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,825
There isn't
a better consolation than money.

310
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:13,077
I won't forget this favor.

311
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:18,541
When my baby is cured, I'll repay you

312
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,836
and pay back the credit card debt.

313
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:27,258
I'll repay everything to the last penny.

314
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:33,431
Where's the kid's dad?

315
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,853
He has to know his child is sick.

316
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,605
You still can't reach him?

317
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,776
Don't tell me he knows.

318
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,239
Give me his number.

319
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:52,408
Give me his contact.

320
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,077
-Give it to me, quickly!
-Il-seob…

321
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:58,372
Dad.

322
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:06,547
How dare you meet up with this
filthy undertaker when your baby is sick!

323
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:08,174
You.

324
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:10,593
What are your intentions?
Why are you here?!

325
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,511
It's nothing like that.

326
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:16,766
The baby getting sick without reason?
A baby that was born fine?

327
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:23,439
You took all of her fortune away from her.
Who do you think you are showing up again!

328
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,859
You are an abomination to our family--

329
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:32,698
Oh no! A mistake!

330
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:36,160
I'm sorry. I mistook you for someone else.

331
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:40,039
Your loud voice sounded like you were
the guy that stiffed us and ran away.

332
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:45,461
-See. This bad luck.
-Hey Ahjussi!

333
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:49,632
Where are you looking? I hit you, not him.
Fair and square, don't you know?

334
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:56,430
If your head hurts, go get it treated.

335
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,141
If you're still upset, sue me.

336
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:17,034
<i>Is your team leader really unmarried?</i>

337
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:18,995
<i>Oh, my dad wanted me to ask.</i>

338
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,079
<i>Ya.</i>

339
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:21,872
<i>Not even once?</i>

340
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,207
<i>Ya.</i>

341
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,001
<i>No kids, right?</i>

342
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:26,794
<i>Ya.</i>

343
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:33,968
Is this the start of a
life-and-death kind of love for me?

344
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:46,689
Life is sweet and savory.

345
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:51,444
<i>Jeyuk </i>and macaron.

346
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,239
What a combination. Am I right?

347
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,162
-This is a perfect little dessert.
-Don't eat that.

348
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,831
It's mine.

349
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:09,378
He's a little stingy.
You saying I can't have some of yours?

350
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,881
No, you can't.

351
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:17,636
You're eating a macaron?
What's the occasion?

352
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:31,192
Man, that one looked the most delicious.

353
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:37,281
<i>Dong-joo, are the task manuals for</i>
<i>the new trainees ready?</i>

354
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:39,158
Can I please get off here?

355
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:42,536
-Why?
-Work issues.

356
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:55,091
Thank you.

357
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,139
-Drive safe.
-See ya.

358
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,604
Isn't Dong-joo cute?

359
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:12,983
Not sure.

360
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:20,741
A positive personality is something you're
born with. She just lightens the mood.

361
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:23,994
She even eats well.

362
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:28,791
Was it good for you?

363
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:31,752
Yeah.

364
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,212
I see.

365
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:34,964
How about the macaron?

366
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:38,509
-Why are you carrying that around?
-Were they from Chung-ha?

367
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:46,642
-No.
-It's fine. I saw her leave that night.

368
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,064
Usually, as you live

369
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:56,485
you find out eventually,
"Oh, I see why that happened now."

370
00:28:57,403 --> 00:29:00,030
But sometimes you don't.

371
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,825
Chung-ha is probably like that.

372
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:06,203
Time is probably not healing her.

373
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,665
Wouldn't it get worse for her?

374
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:14,712
She probably can't understand why.
Because there was no reason to break up.

375
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:39,528
Doctor.

376
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:48,954
-Doctor?
-Huh?

377
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:58,130
-I'm going to get some fresh air.
-Sure.

378
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,565
Excuse me!

379
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,363
-Hello.
-It is you.

380
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:24,198
Do you remember me?

381
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:25,658
Of course I do.

382
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:29,370
You must be a doctor here.

383
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,205
Yes. In the ER.

384
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:33,332
How about you?

385
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:36,335
Why are you back here at the…

386
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:40,756
-Yes?
-Oh, nothing. What brings you here?

387
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:45,636
I work here too.

388
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,430
Oh. I see.

389
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,901
We were pretty close.

390
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:06,156
-That's why you had the chrysanthemums.
-Yes, that's right.

391
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:09,076
You're so considerate.

392
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:11,704
A kind and warm person.

393
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:16,500
You were from the first time we met.

394
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:20,671
Sorry about yesterday.

395
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:23,257
It's nothing.

396
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:27,136
I went overboard
not knowing there was a guest.

397
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:30,598
You don't have to worry about me.

398
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:32,600
That's great, thank you.

399
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:38,480
Because we kind of have a story.

400
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:46,155
Let's see each other more often.
My name is Tak Chung-ha.

401
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:48,073
I'm Baek Dong-joo.

402
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:06,008
<i>Because we kind of have a story.</i>

403
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:22,149
Good evening.

404
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:24,818
What brings you--

405
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,279
You had work here today?

406
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:31,325
-Yes.
-You're working hard into the night.

407
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,245
Is Dong-joo doing alright?

408
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:37,956
Yes, she's doing well.

409
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,045
And how is the backpack?

410
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,798
I was coming to see you about that.

411
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:49,385
It's great.
I'm being really careful with it.

412
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:54,515
Just use it for everything. I'll make you
another one with lambskin this time.

413
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:57,518
It's very soft. Great leather.

414
00:32:57,768 --> 00:33:00,437
-It's really okay.
-I want to.

415
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:05,567
First, though, I'll make something for him

416
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:07,986
and then make yours.

417
00:33:09,697 --> 00:33:10,989
He's a friend of mine.

418
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:14,618
He's the closest person I have
at this apartment complex.

419
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,830
He turns off
the playground lights every night.

420
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,500
He lost his father early,

421
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,712
and his mother works day and night.

422
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:26,296
Their lives

423
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:28,507
are harsh.

424
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:12,384
-Father.
-Yes?

425
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:15,637
Here are
the Sunday school students' journals.

426
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:18,182
-It's been a month already.
-Yes.

427
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:20,559
Thank you. Yes.

428
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:26,273
MICHAELA
I WOULD LIKE A NEW CONSOLE

429
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,108
ANNA
I WANT A DOG PLEASE

430
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,404
RITA
I WANT A PHONE

431
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,616
JOSEPH

432
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:41,955
<i>Disappointed.</i>

433
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,417
I'm a little disappointed these days.

434
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:53,759
I think God might be too.

435
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:58,388
You can have this one.

436
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:05,979
I think God is a bit sad because Joseph

437
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,482
isn't praying to Him anymore.

438
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:11,485
I just think so.

439
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:16,490
Joseph, do you not have
anything to pray about?

440
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:21,078
Something you wish for or want to do. Hm?

441
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,962
I would like to grant you one.

442
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,966
Don't tell your friends.

443
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:40,138
You can't tell the
other brothers or sisters either.

444
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,015
Promise.

445
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:48,689
Stamp.

446
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:56,613
Camping?

447
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:00,242
Most definitely, Father.

448
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:06,707
Of course, I, as the CEO of A Dime A Job,
should take care of this.

449
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,126
What day?

450
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:12,087
It's perfect. Yes.

451
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:15,716
No worries. Okay.

452
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:20,596
Let me see. What should I prepare?

453
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,973
There is a lot to buy.

454
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:25,684
Hey, Butler Kim!

455
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,185
Director.

456
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,354
Right, Director Kim!

457
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:33,775
The CEO's got a business trip on the 10th.

458
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,069
Please adjust your schedule accordingly.

459
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:42,492
On top of this,

460
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:45,078
I will have a backpack.

461
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:47,998
Then I will be ready to camp. Perfect.

462
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:57,883
<i>Uncle, can I see you today?</i>

463
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,302
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

464
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:06,391
Aren't you going?

465
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,318
Thank you for coming.

466
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:18,862
Brother Vincent said
he couldn't make it today.

467
00:37:18,946 --> 00:37:21,490
I was worried
we might have to postpone it.

468
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:23,742
Joseph really wanted to go.

469
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:27,621
I'm sure Joseph will have more fun with me
than my uncle.

470
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,247
Of course he will.

471
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:33,001
Joseph, this is the brother that will
go camping with you today.

472
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:34,836
Hello.

473
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:36,296
Nice to meet you.

474
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:38,507
Let us have fun for the two days.

475
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,591
Okay.

476
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,386
This is not quite everyone yet.

477
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,846
Here she comes.

478
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:54,606
Hi!

479
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,151
<i>Brother nephew is coming?</i>

480
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:01,488
I see.

481
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:03,657
<i>The kid from that time?</i>

482
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:07,285
<i>Yes. Brother nephew is going instead,</i>

483
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:09,371
<i>and I wish it could be fun.</i>

484
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:11,873
I'm afraid if he goes alone with him,

485
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:14,042
it'll be awkward for Joseph.

486
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:18,005
<i>Dong-joo, you are so good</i>
<i>with children, you know?</i>

487
00:38:24,011 --> 00:38:25,887
<i>Thanks for doing this, Dong-joo.</i>

488
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:28,765
<i>-Please let him have fun.</i>
<i>-I will.</i>

489
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:33,395
<i>And you have fun too, Dong-joo.</i>

490
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:39,192
Joseph, wanna play a game?

491
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:43,989
Which game should we play?

492
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:46,408
Good times.

493
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,618
Enjoy, Dong-joo.

494
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:54,583
-Father.
-Yes?

495
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:00,297
On the way to camping

496
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:03,550
there are mountains, there are birds,

497
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,510
there is a grandma with a stroller,

498
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:07,596
there is Cut-And-Perm Hair Salon,

499
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,306
there is Seon Ok-ja H<i>aejangguk.</i>

500
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:12,726
There are mountains, there are birds,

501
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,895
there is a grandma with a stroller,

502
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:17,105
there is Cut-And-Perm Hair Salon,

503
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:20,192
there is Seon Ok-ja H<i>aejangguk,</i>
there are traffic lights.

504
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:23,153
There are mountains, there are birds,

505
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:25,489
-there is Cut-And-Perm Hair Sal--
-Beep.

506
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:30,660
-Why?
-It's "Grandma with a stroller" first.

507
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:32,204
That's what I said.

508
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:33,413
You didn't.

509
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:35,707
-I did.
-Dong-joo <i>ssi.</i>

510
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,711
You didn't. Joseph is right.

511
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:49,471
Alright, Joseph. You win. When we're off,
you can flick my forehead hard.

512
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:51,181
Because

513
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:53,308
I only play fair.

514
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:56,561
Wanna play something else?

515
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:00,190
Why not? Should we play this
one again then?

516
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:01,525
No?

517
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:10,534
-Let's take a break at the next stop.
-Suddenly?

518
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:17,791
I forgot to have you go before the drive.
Sorry about that.

519
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:20,752
-Tell me if you need to go again later.
-Okay.

520
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,463
Let's wash our hands.

521
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:31,012
I'll take care of these, so head down
and look for a good tent spot.

522
00:40:31,972 --> 00:40:33,849
Joseph, go on ahead with Tae-hee.

523
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:41,857
Joseph, can you help carry this?

524
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,568
We have so much stuff here.
We need your help.

525
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,238
I can carry more.

526
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:49,406
Wow, really?

527
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:51,116
You're amazing.

528
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:55,203
-Then, can you carry this too?
-Yeah!

529
00:40:58,665 --> 00:40:59,916
He really liked that.

530
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,460
Kids that age
hate being treated like a baby.

531
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:05,881
Joseph, wait for me!

532
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,176
Hurry up.

533
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:11,469
Joseph, are you okay?

534
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,973
You gotta answer her properly.

535
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:18,185
This is beautiful.

536
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,505
You've never put one up before, huh?

537
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:52,677
-No.
-Hand it to me. I'll do it.

538
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:53,887
I'll figure it out.

539
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,013
I'll do it.

540
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:59,559
I think you should
start preparing for dinner with Joseph.

541
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:02,646
-I'll do that after this.
-Let me do it, please.

542
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:06,024
Oh, goodness, what the--

543
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:11,821
Oh man. How are you running
A Dime A Job like this?

544
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:13,657
Careful! Give it here.

545
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:23,541
Don't laugh at me.

546
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,669
Mom is better than the dad.

547
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:28,505
I'm not his mother.

548
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:31,549
See? I told you he's their nephew.

549
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:33,343
It's so obvious.

550
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:35,679
Did you come with your uncle?

551
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:37,889
He's my older brother<i>.</i>

552
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:43,353
Oh my. Your parents must be a very loving
couple. They had you really late.

553
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:46,564
You're lucky having
a nice brother like that.

554
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:49,818
But don't get in their way too much.

555
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,736
You brother's here for a good time.

556
00:42:52,279 --> 00:42:56,408
-He's on a date with his girlfriend.
-Oh no, it's nothing like that.

557
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:58,660
Please, we're not blind.

558
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:01,871
There's nothing wrong with
camping together these days.

559
00:43:01,955 --> 00:43:03,373
You look nice together!

560
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:05,792
It's not like that.

561
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:08,545
Honey, this reminds me of us.

562
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:28,356
Don't run.

563
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,191
You'll get hurt.

564
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:47,083
You're good at everything, Dong-joo<i>.</i>

565
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:52,672
I should recruit you.

566
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:04,184
Oh, a few days ago,

567
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:08,271
I met your friend from the hospital.

568
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:17,614
Did you?

569
00:44:19,908 --> 00:44:22,077
So I guess you were working together

570
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:23,578
when you met her.

571
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:28,083
Yes.

572
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,461
I see.

573
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,521
I'm really sorry about that night.

574
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:54,067
Well, how is it now?

575
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:55,443
With her.

576
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:04,035
It's all in the past.

577
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:35,775
-Go on ahead.
-Huh?

578
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:40,488
GOMCHON
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION

579
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,285
Mr. Owner!

580
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:47,370
Long time no see.

581
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:51,040
Why were you closed for so long?

582
00:45:51,124 --> 00:45:55,670
You'd be surprised if you knew
how many times I checked this place.

583
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:58,465
-Did you?
-Yes.

584
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,843
I wanted to see President Kim Dae-joong.

585
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:05,346
I need to get me one of these.

586
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:06,973
AWARD
FIREFIGHTER PARK CHEOL-MIN

587
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:11,519
Catch a big one,
get the two stars on my uniform,

588
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:13,938
and go straight to
the chief position is my dream.

589
00:46:14,022 --> 00:46:15,940
Where's that big one I can catch?

590
00:46:16,149 --> 00:46:17,275
You can do it.

591
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:20,278
You caught that hit-and-run from
Iam intersection,

592
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:22,947
and chased after a drunk driver
for 30km and got him.

593
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:25,366
I have no doubt you can.

594
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:30,413
I actually

595
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:34,083
came to cheer you up a little bit.

596
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:38,505
You saved so many lives

597
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:41,341
and even got an award
from the president himself.

598
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:43,176
You'll get what you deserve.

599
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:48,139
Your daughter will recover soon.

600
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:55,188
Yeah. You want a cold cup of coffee?

601
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:59,400
Sure. I'd appreciate it with some ice.

602
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:06,658
It gets cold at night. Cover yourself up.

603
00:47:09,536 --> 00:47:10,537
There you go.

604
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:15,291
Let's eat!

605
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:19,629
Joseph, you like meat, right?

606
00:47:30,265 --> 00:47:31,266
Eat up.

607
00:47:34,102 --> 00:47:35,103
You too.

608
00:47:35,562 --> 00:47:36,646
We'll wait.

609
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:38,106
I'm eating.

610
00:47:38,398 --> 00:47:40,608
-I'll grill.
-Eat first.

611
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:42,402
Jeez…

612
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:59,085
I make some really mean <i>ssam</i>.

613
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:04,591
Okay, I'll make you more <i>ssam.</i>
Joseph first though.

614
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:08,761
Joseph, why aren't you eating?

615
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:10,805
I am.

616
00:48:11,014 --> 00:48:12,223
You haven't had any.

617
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:14,225
I am eating.

618
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:21,190
Say, "ee."

619
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:24,819
Go on.

620
00:48:41,878 --> 00:48:44,589
Do we have to pull it out?

621
00:48:45,465 --> 00:48:46,507
I'm sorry.

622
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:48,843
Mommy told us to please pull it out.

623
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:50,470
It'll be done soon.

624
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:52,972
It'll be on three.

625
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:57,352
One…

626
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:00,563
two!

627
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:08,196
Stop crying and look.
Guess what this is.

628
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:12,116
Doesn't it feel good?
It was nothing, right?

629
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,369
-You're okay, right?
-Of course he is.

630
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:15,953
Say "ee." Let us see.

631
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:18,539
Come on, show us!

632
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:24,879
This is nothing. Why were you not eating
trying to hide it?

633
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:29,509
-We won't know if you don't say anything.
-That's right. Ask him for anything.

634
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:33,179
Excuse me.

635
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:37,475
So sorry, but can you help us?

636
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:40,311
My husband is not very good at it.

637
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:43,773
-Oh. Sure.
-No, not you.

638
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,441
Her.

639
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:49,237
-Me?
-Yes.

640
00:49:52,782 --> 00:49:54,867
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

641
00:49:58,162 --> 00:49:59,831
Thank you so much!

642
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:16,597
You got something you want?

643
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:20,393
Tell me if you wanna do anything.

644
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,272
What did you want to do while camping?

645
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:33,990
Joseph, you wanna see something cool?

646
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:36,868
Come here.

647
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:41,956
Right here.

648
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:44,625
Watch.

649
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:46,252
If you do…

650
00:50:50,757 --> 00:50:51,758
this to it,

651
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:55,178
you'll get your new tooth faster.
A strong one.

652
00:50:57,054 --> 00:51:00,308
Please give Joseph
a pretty and strong tooth!

653
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,546
Come here. Say "ee," right now.

654
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:36,135
Dude, you can run all you want,
but you'll have to pull it at some point.

655
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:38,930
What? What is that.

656
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:42,433
I'll make it painless. I promise.
Say "ahh."

657
00:52:30,398 --> 00:52:32,900
Joseph, open your eyes on three.

658
00:52:34,569 --> 00:52:37,613
One, two, three.

659
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:43,452
Wow.

660
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:49,750
Wow. So many stars.

661
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:53,212
You can see them so clearly.

662
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:03,723
Did you want something?

663
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:12,106
What is it?

664
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:13,774
You can tell me.

665
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:17,445
I want to see stars.

666
00:53:18,905 --> 00:53:19,906
Stars?

667
00:53:20,907 --> 00:53:25,286
I can't see them clearly
from home or the playground.

668
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:33,252
I heard you can see stars clearly
in the dark.

669
00:53:34,337 --> 00:53:38,215
They said if you go camping,
it gets really dark.

670
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:43,846
Is that why you wanted to go camping?

671
00:53:46,766 --> 00:53:47,767
Why?

672
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:50,686
-Huh?
-Why did you want to see stars?

673
00:53:53,314 --> 00:53:56,567
My dad became a star.

674
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:00,988
Mommy said so.

675
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:07,244
She said
he's always watching over us as a star.

676
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:11,582
She said

677
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:17,588
we can see him whenever we want to, but…

678
00:54:55,543 --> 00:54:56,794
Daddy.

679
00:55:05,386 --> 00:55:06,804
Daddy.

680
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:28,367
You must miss daddy a lot.

681
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,458
My mom is

682
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:36,959
also right there.

683
00:55:40,046 --> 00:55:41,088
My mom…

684
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:44,300
also became a star.

685
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:53,100
I bet she's there with your daddy.

686
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:59,398
I bet they are watching over us

687
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:03,527
so that we are doing well.

688
00:56:08,741 --> 00:56:10,284
Daddy.

689
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:11,846
Is Joseph asleep?

690
00:57:12,388 --> 00:57:13,806
Yes, he is.

691
00:57:14,974 --> 00:57:16,684
It must have been tiring today.

692
00:57:21,397 --> 00:57:23,274
Thank you for everything today.

693
00:57:24,817 --> 00:57:25,818
It was nothing.

694
00:57:28,988 --> 00:57:31,740
If it's okay with you,
do you want to go for a walk?

695
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:35,077
It's such a nice night out.

696
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:42,334
Thank you.

697
00:57:46,297 --> 00:57:47,548
Thanks to you,

698
00:57:48,757 --> 00:57:51,218
I think Joseph feels a lot better.

699
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:53,512
Nah, I haven't done anything.

700
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:57,975
It would have been nice if Joseph's mom
came with us to watch the stars.

701
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,187
The saying "they are
watching over us as stars"

702
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:05,191
was probably not a lie just for Joseph.

703
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:09,403
Joseph's mother probably thinks that too.

704
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:14,158
Many of the bereaved do.

705
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:20,789
Isn't it hard?

706
00:58:23,626 --> 00:58:25,878
Facing death at work every day.

707
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:31,217
It's not just death I'm facing.

708
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:33,928
There are the bereaved.

709
00:58:36,305 --> 00:58:38,140
There are people that must live

710
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:40,768
despite everything.

711
00:58:42,645 --> 00:58:45,522
I learned that
there isn't only death at funeral homes.

712
00:58:49,068 --> 00:58:52,988
I hope Joseph thinks about this night
whenever he misses his dad.

713
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:58,744
How are you so good
at taking care of kids?

714
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:02,665
You knew when he needed
to go to the bathroom,

715
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,875
and the kind of things he likes,

716
00:59:05,084 --> 00:59:06,877
and, right, the loose tooth.

717
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:09,838
People would think
you've raised kids before.

718
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:44,665
I have a little brother.

719
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:49,670
LET'S GO,
CONSTELLATION JOURNEY

720
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:52,631
I don't want to. I have to read this.

721
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:56,176
<i>You read that book so many times.</i>

722
00:59:57,011 --> 00:59:59,179
<i>You have it memorized already.</i>

723
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:01,473
Come on, kid.

724
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:04,727
-I'll take you there.
-<i>Where?</i>

725
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:09,148
<i>-</i>To watch the stars.
-For real?!

726
01:00:11,692 --> 01:00:15,904
Liar. You're going to say you're busy
and have no time and sleep instead.

727
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:19,491
I mean it. For real this time.

728
01:00:19,575 --> 01:00:22,202
-You mean it?!
-<i>Yep. Promise.</i>

729
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:24,913
Yes! I really want to go!

730
01:00:24,997 --> 01:00:25,998
But only if you

731
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:29,084
bring it to Bongsu Market.

732
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:30,377
<i>Yeah, I'll be there.</i>

733
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:34,631
Alright. I'll be there by eight.

734
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:35,716
<i>Okay.</i>

735
01:00:40,346 --> 01:00:43,140
Jeez. What's so good about stars?

736
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:49,938
BROTHER

737
01:00:51,482 --> 01:00:53,567
<i>The person you have…</i>

738
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:05,788
Yeah, Joon-ho. I'm about to lea--

739
01:01:19,218 --> 01:01:22,388
EMERGENCY CARE

740
01:01:34,108 --> 01:01:35,109
Doctor?

741
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:35,586
Joon-ho.

742
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:42,217
Joon-ho!

743
01:02:53,896 --> 01:02:54,938
<i>Because of me…</i>

744
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:08,410
Because of me…

745
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:14,666
he died.

746
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:42,921
Hey, can you open the door, please?

747
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:46,008
I left the ring in front of Bongsu Market.

748
01:04:46,425 --> 01:04:48,552
My brother won't be able to find it.

749
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:54,808
It's really important for him.

750
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,977
Please open the door.

751
01:04:58,186 --> 01:05:00,063
Find my brother's ring. Please?

752
01:05:00,689 --> 01:05:03,233
If you can't find it,
ask the policeman. Okay?

753
01:05:15,203 --> 01:05:22,127
BONGSU MARKET
DEMOLITION

754
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,557
Sir, please help me.

755
01:06:22,521 --> 01:06:24,981
<i>Thank you, for being next to me right now.</i>

756
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:29,069
<i>Dong-joo, I learned that</i>
<i>love doesn't come easily.</i>

757
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:30,445
<i>I'll leave in a few days.</i>

758
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:32,948
<i>What'll it take to go back to those days?</i>

759
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,701
<i>What's wrong? Why are you so angry?</i>

760
01:06:35,784 --> 01:06:38,120
<i>Why do I always make people miserable?</i>

761
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:41,123
<i>We're over. Over, I said.</i>

762
01:06:57,013 --> 01:07:00,016
