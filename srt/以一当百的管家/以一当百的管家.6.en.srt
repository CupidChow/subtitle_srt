1
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,080
Baek Dong-joo.

2
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,170
They're pretty.

3
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,300
They're great.

4
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,680
Your hands.

5
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,530
Wanna go get some beer?

6
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,200
Just one glass.

7
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,710
You always hold it in like that?

8
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,960
If you can't cuss at their faces,
try it on me.

9
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,710
You don't know how?

10
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,260
I'll teach you.

11
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,470
Choose one.

12
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,800
A satisfying one? A thick one?

13
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,060
-A feisty one?
-What would--

14
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,270
What would what?
It's better than just sitting there.

15
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,770
Okay, repeat after me.

16
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,100
<i>-Ssi</i>--
-What would that accomplish?

17
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,310
Change what my hands do?

18
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,950
No, it wouldn't.

19
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,410
But someone had the chance
to meet his son

20
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,910
and another person

21
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,670
was able to give his family
his secret stash of money.

22
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,550
Without your hands,

23
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,930
Apple mom's husband wouldn't have
made it back alive either.

24
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,680
What you do is amazing,

25
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:22,770
and I envy you.

26
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,730
Ridiculous.

27
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,400
You don't know what homework is? Jeez…

28
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,030
I'm really

29
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,700
just forcing myself to do it
because it's homework.

30
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,290
If it is, it's okay not to.

31
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,540
Why struggle so hard?

32
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,830
If you put it off and not finish,

33
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,170
all you'll have is
a lecture from the teacher.

34
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,000
Get a beating and move on.

35
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,010
Why do you try so hard
if it's just homework?

36
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,180
While holding in everything like that.

37
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,190
That's why it's hard.

38
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,820
You couldn't tell anyone.

39
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,370
I bet it was lonely.

40
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,600
That daughter-in-law lady
is so annoying.

41
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,520
Ditch their Departure tomorrow!

42
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,480
-Ditch it!
-Ditch it!

43
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,060
I give you the permission.

44
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,780
-You're terrible!
-Why did you hit me?!

45
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,240
I already don't wanna go,
why are you being a bad influence?

46
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,820
If I don't go, it's all your fault.

47
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,370
How dare you talk to me like that?

48
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,710
You said you were 25, I'm 30. 30!

49
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,460
-So annoying.
-What's annoying?

50
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,170
-Annoying!
-Annoying Shmannoying!

51
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,050
Man, never in my life have I…

52
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,350
From there to here

53
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,390

54
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,440

00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,110
Come on, wake up.

56
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,120
Wow, so many stairs.

57
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,790
I can't do this.

58
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,250
This place has too many stairs.

59
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,750
Wake up.

60
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,590
Stop the weird noise.
What's the pass code?

61
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,920
Huh? What did you say?

62
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,180
-One two three four…
-One two three four?

63
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,990
I'm so exhausted.

64
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,260

65
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,010

66
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,640
-Where am I? How did I get in here?
-This is my…

67

68
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,610
sleep together?

69
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,820
-No, we didn't sleep together.
-We didn't?

70
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,570
No. Nothing happened.

71

-Yeah.
-Not like they can hear us.

126
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,180
Ow, my back.

127
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:02,060
For Goodness sakes,

Then it reminded me of you.

181
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,030
I have

182
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,820
gone back to that house.

183
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,700
A Dime A Job.

184
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,490
Did the man move out?

185
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,870
Have I misheard?

186
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,580
Wasn't it the owner's house?

187
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,790
That's right.

188
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,540
He apologized.

189
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,920
Shockers.

190
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,460
-Right after going berserk on you?
-I know, right?

191
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,840
But then I found out that he

192
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,340
-went to the Incheon Bridge.
-What?

193
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,220
He said it was
weighing on his mind or whatever.

194
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,350
Anyways,

195
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,730
he saved our chief mourner.
I don't think he's that bad of a person.

196
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,900
What an unpredictable person.

197
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,440
"I couldn't hear it. Because of you."

198
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,990
That weighed on his mind
the most, apparently.

199
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,700
Maybe he can't handle self-blame.
Some people have it bad.

200
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,120
Why did that weigh on his mind?

201
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,670
Not sure.

202
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,250
Anything else he said?

203
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,710
<i>They're pretty.</i>

204
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,420
They're great.

205
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,640
Your hands.

206
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,350
You couldn't tell anyone.

207
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,850
I bet it was lonely.

208
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,690
Nope.

209
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,150
-Nothing.
-I see.

210
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,860
It's not great,
but at least it's better news.

211
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,490
At least you don't have to be anxious.

212
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,990
Now you can do your homework in peace.

213
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,530
If it is, it's okay not to do it.

214
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,370
-Yes.
-However,

215
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,870
if he's mean to you again next time

216
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,580
I will not let it slide.

217
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,210
Please let me know.

218
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,550
You've heard of my past life, right?

219
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,800
They said I was a warrior
that protected the king.

220
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,930
Slicing, stabbing, dicing. No joke.

221
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,600
-It's dad.
-Oh God.

222
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,060
Is he near?

223
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,850
-Is he watching us from somewhere?
-He said he was home on the phone earlier.

224
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,020
Hi, Dad.

225
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,860
I told you. The cram school.

226
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,610
Huh? Where are you, Dad?

227
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,530
-Right now?
-Oh, no.

228
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,160
Okay. Got it.

229
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,920
-Uncle!
-We don't have to both die!

230
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,040
No, he's at Noryangjin.

231
00:18:04,576 --> 00:18:06,780
Oh my God! Jesus Christ!

232
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,472
What the hell am I supposed to do?!

233
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,121
Oh shit.

234
00:18:10,229 --> 00:18:11,670
What about your clothes?

235
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,300
Dong-joo! clothes!

236
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,800
Just get me any clothes on the hangers.

237
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,100
Yes, bag too.

I'm so sorry,
but can you move forward, please?

00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,460
Sorry.

00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,470

Wait for me!

255
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:34,900
Dong-joo, take your bag. Your bag--

256
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,870
What am I doing here?

257
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,540
Oh, my heart.

00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,290
-Hey, your bag.
-Thank you.

00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,250
-I'll be going now.
-Yes, thank you.

260
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,340
Dong-joo!

261
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,010
Oh, Dad!

262
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,640
You didn't show up
so I was going to the--

263
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,020
Are you by chance…

264
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,070
Oh man!

265
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:22,570
Oh man.

266
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:23,950
Hello.

267
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,240
Hello!

268
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,500
How do you two…

269
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,000
How do <i>you </i>two…

270
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,460
Oh.

271
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,300
I went to

272
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
Your mom, and…

273
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,350
I can't believe how small this world is!

274
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,730
Who would have known you live
in the same building as Dong-joo?

275
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,900
I was really shocked too.

276
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,530
You two look really close to each other.

277
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,320
All the way in <i>Noryangjin </i>together?

278
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,700
I also started prepping for civil jobs.

279
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,250
Is that so?

280
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,620
Good for you!

281
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,630
Studying needs a friend
to not get burnt out.

282
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,800
Give him some information.
You said it's important.

283
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,300
-Of course!
-She's helping a lot.

284
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,800
I see.

285
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,890
But how did you two
recognize each other right away?

286
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,900
Didn't you meet just the one time
you went to see mom?

287
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,860
Actually, I have an ability.

288
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,150
I never forget someone I meet.

289
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,650
Oh man!

290
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:47,160
Why would I need to meet him more?
He's a tall and handsome guy.

291
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,370
Who's there, by the way?

292
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:03,050
Are this all the sides you get?
We should have ordered more.

293
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,760
-We eat like this here and become…
-There's nothing to eat.

294
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,680
…rank 9, rank 7, rank 5, police officers
and firefighters, and everything.

295
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:13,520
So don't come with all those fruits.
I'm eating well.

296
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,020
Good try, kid.

297
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:18,020
You don't even eat apples,
so you don't have to peel them.

298
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:21,280
-They come peeled and cut at stores now.
-That's not the same.

299
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,440
It's so much better.

300
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,650
-I'm gonna get sulky.
-Okay.

TEAM LEADER
IM IL-SEOB

302
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,210
Who's "Team leader Im Il-seob?"

303
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,920
-Huh?
-Why didn't you answer?

304
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,550
Who was that?

305
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,840
-I… It's--
-Do you know "Team leader Kim Mi-yeong?"

306
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:47,590
-Who?
-They spam call the heck out of you.

307
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,140
I think I've heard of it.

308
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,970
Kim Mi-yeong is gone

309
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,470
and now there's an Im Il-seob,
as they say.

310
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,730
Yes.

311
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,060
I also have it saved, so I don't answer.

312
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:00,020
-See? Im Il-seob.
-Right there.

313
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,070
Im Il-seob, huh…

314
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,370
Why don't you tell me stuff like this?

315
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,250
I also need to know
so I don't answer them.

316
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:21,170
-You should tell him.
-Okay, I'll let you know.

317
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,750
You always tell me late.

00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,270
Oh man, wrong pipe.

00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,940
It's the memorial park, right?

324
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,160
There's a promotion on
management fees right now.

325
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,780
They call and say 5% off if you do
five years' worth in one cash payment.

326
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,170
-No wonder I kept getting calls from them.
-That's correct.

327
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,750
I should call back later.

-Get along, you two.
-Yes, sir.

Thanks.

343
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,780
Why were you so scared?
You were almost shaking.

00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,910

How did you choose your job?

351
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,570
I don't have that many skills.

352
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,950
Everything other people have,
a university diploma

353
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,990
TOEIC scores, certificates.

requires no special skills,

357
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,790
gets me insurances,

358
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,880
is full time, and has no retirement.

359
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,880
So I was like, "Nice!" and started

360
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,720
I didn't know I had an ability like that.

361
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,510
This is so much different from the
Baek Dong-joo I imagined as a kid.

362
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,890
What did you imagine as a kid?

363
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,770
Getting a gold medal at the Olympics?

364
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,810
You played sports?

365
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,200
Table Tennis.

366
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,990
I would have never imagined. Wow.

367
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,580
How about you, how did you start
A Dime A Job?

368
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,080
Because my uncle was doing it.

369
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,420
How about before that?

370
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,720
I served in the military.

371
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,220
You went really late.

372
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:03,970
Somehow, yes.

373
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,370
This is <i>Omija </i>wine.

374
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,660
Bloody red, it looks nice.

375
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,080
It's good for you.

376
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,830
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

377
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,840
Man, that's strong!

378
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,630
You think you can fool me again?
You didn't drink any of that.

379
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:40,510
People would say Lee Tae-baek
came back to life.

380
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,100
I tell you time after time.

381
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,720
I have no tolerance limit,
and I've never been drunk.

382
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,520
So show me how you fare.

383
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,980
Maybe someday.

384
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,310
If only.

385
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,690
Our Dong-joo came back home,

386
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,650
so please let it slide. It's a great day.

387
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,400
And you should know.

388
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:05,330
I want to officially start, the Seo Hae-an
and Baek Dong-joo Hook-up Project.

389
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,500
Vincent, help me out here.

390
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,000
You're starting again.

391
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,960
-Why would I?
-What the…!

392
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:18,130
You're not gonna recognize the number one
contributor that filled that vacant room?

393
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,010
Don't you know that
she's back thanks to me?

394
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,640
-No idea.
-Wow.

395
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,220
I,

396
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,850
this Seo Hae-an,

397
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,140
didn't give up and
persistently convinced her to come back.

398
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,600
Sincerity pays off.

399
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,360
-Are you certain?
-Why wouldn't I be?

400
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,110
-Was that it?
-Yep.

401
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:42,660
I did think it was weird that
she just came back suddenly.

402
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:48,700
I heard she left
the day she met my nephew.

403
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:52,080
I wondered if something happened
between them? A fight?

404
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,710
And they made up and came back?

405
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,000
Vincent, for real!

406
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:01,050
Why would you even imagine such a thing!

407
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,970
Fights don't happen that easily.

408
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:11,020
It needs things like interest, love,
expectations for two people to fight.

409
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,770
They have none of that.

410
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:16,690
Why would they waste
their emotion and time like that?

411
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:20,240
What are you so riled up about?
Eat your <i>ramen</i>.

412
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,700
You say some
weird things sometimes, Vincent.

413
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,830
What's this?

414
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,750
Oh, that?

415
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,750
Tae-hee got that from working four hours
at the Bongsu Apartment gardens.

416
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,130
That idiot.

417
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,380
This is perfect.

418
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,420
Perfect, my butt!

419
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:45,470
He worked under the Sun
picking peppers, lettuces, spinach--

420
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:48,390
You know nothing.
Look at this.

421
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:49,850
How many is that?

422
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,480
Four, right?

423
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,100
How many live in this house?

424
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,600
Four.

425
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:59,190
This is perfect for
a resident get-together.

426
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,360
The four of us could
go see a movie together.

427
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:02,700
Right.

428
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,320
Better strike while the iron is hot.

429
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,870
Let's see. How's this Friday?

430
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:11,410
I think it'll work.

431
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,830
I will contact the group.

432
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,460
I wonder what stupid thing
Tae-hee is up to right now.

433
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,960
Tell me about it.

434
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,420
That kid's got a screw loose somewhere.

435
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,190
<i>"A Dime A Job house get-together</i>
<i>will be held this Friday.</i>

436
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:41,150
<i>Please join us for a group movie watching.</i>

437
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,360
<i>There will be a fine of 912.8 billion Won</i>

438
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,780

439
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,030
<i>Bongsu Cinema, at 2 p.m.</i>

440
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,290
<i>-Being late will get you 3621 gonjang's!</i>
-Jeez.

441
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,200
Can you go?

442
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,410
I'll have to see.

443
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,880
Excuse me.

444
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,090
-Hello?
<i>-Dude! Are you crazy?</i>

445
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:07,510
<i>You went back there?</i>
<i>Are you finally losing it?</i>

446
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:11,310
<i>You have something with that</i>
<i>"let's break up" guy, don't you?</i>

447
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:15,480
-<i>I knew it. I heard from Jung-hwa that--</i>
-Hey, So-ra, I, I'm working. Yeah. Bye!

448
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,980
Done with work?

449
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,870
Is it gonna rain soon?

450
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:44,300
My back hurts, and my knees hurt.

451
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:48,180
And still I go crazy over rain.

452
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,760
Maybe in my past life I was a dog.

453
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,560
I love the rain so much!

454
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:02,860
My mom used to say, "body and mind
not matching up is the saddest thing",

455
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,230
and she was absolutely right.

456
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,750
How nice.

457
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,470
What's up?

458
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,390
I was just thinking of what to do.

459
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,270
About what?

460
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,770
Whenever it rains,

461
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,530
I get anxious for no reason.

462
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,110
Reminds me of my childhood too.

463
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,740
Do I have to pray to mom again?

464
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,240
I wonder every time.

465
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:03,750
It's raining.

466
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:07,840
-When is your mom coming?
-Like, four, I think.

467
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,680
Oh man.

468
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:21,100
-Hey, Baek Dal-shik!
-Yes, sir.

469
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,130
<i>Mom.</i>

470
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,920
<i>Mom.</i>

471
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,170
<i>I have to go home and</i>
<i>save the laundry from the rain.</i>

472
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,220
<i>When I</i>

473
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:56,510
<i>say that like a magic chant,</i>

474
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,260
<i>the rain would stop.</i>

475
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:04,690
What chant?

476
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,060
It's a secret.

477
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:11,070
-I'll buy you KBBQ.
-Wow!

478
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,110
That hurts my pride.

479
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:23,160
Well, there were days it didn't work.

480
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,750
<i>On days like that…</i>

481
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,960
<i>-</i>Dong-joo!
-Little pumpkin!

482
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,760
Sora, Grandma!

483
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,680
Quickly.

484
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:43,390
Oh, my little puppy.
You must have waited long. Here.

485
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:48,110
-Thank you, Grandma.
-Yes.

486
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:55,320
<i>She would send So-ra's grandmother</i>
<i>who brought an umbrella for me.</i>

487
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,290
Grandma!

488
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,430
Here.

489
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,230
Grandma, you know Baek Dong-joo, right?

490
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:31,480
You know.

491
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,900
You used to bring her an umbrella.

492
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,070
Back in high school

493
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:40,120
You altered her school uniform,
fixed her gym suits,

494
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,120
sewed name tag and buttons on for her.

495
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:45,040
You made her a handkerchief
for our graduation.

496
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,540
That's not all.

497
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,830
You always made her meat sides and
freshly cooked rice when she was here.

498
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,250
You made her dried squid to take home,

499
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,210
and you really adored her.

500
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,170
She's got some senses, though.

501
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:00,050
She gets seasonal fruits for you

502
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,720
and gloves for your birthday.

503
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,180
She once went all the way to City Hall
to get you that famous Castella.

504
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:09,730
Grandma.

505
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,690
Dong-joo is such a fox.

506
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,900
Cunning.

507
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,230
She has a man.

508
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,900
I know she does!

509
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:19,200
Everybody knows it
but she acts dumb.

510
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,780
What do you think?

511
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:25,490
It'll come.

512
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:29,620
-Huh?
-"This is the guy."

513
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,040
The moment one realizes this.

514
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,750
If it's fate.

515
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,300
Really?

516
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,760
Would it come for me too?

517
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,220
-Of course.
-When?

518
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,100
Within a moon.

519
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,690
Who is this young maiden?

520
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,820
How beautiful.

521
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,030
-How old are you?
-25.

522
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,660
-Are you married?
-I want to.

523
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,540
Oh no, at that age?

524
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,870
Do you have a plan?

525
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,380
You should be having many babies by now.

526
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:17,130
There's no worse disrespect than this
to your parents.

527
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,090
It's raining, Grandma.

528
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,140
Please get some rest while
watching the rain fall.

529
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:33,150
Sewing seems to have
absolutely no positive effect on dementia.

530
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,460
It's me instead of grandma today.

531
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,630
Let's go.

532
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,310
I don't think it'll stop today.

533
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,280
Let's go.

534
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,960
Wait up.

535
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
What's wrong?
Did something happen?

536
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,430
Your friend's grandmother?

537
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,510
Is it…

538
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,720
the umbrella grandma--

539
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:22,110
That's why you even changed shifts.

540
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:43,000
EONJU UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
FUNERAL HOME

541
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,600
-Should we go that way instead?
-Why?

542
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,200
-That's him, isn't it?
-Who?

543
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:15,200
-Is that him?
-That's…

544
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,790
Kim Tae-hee.

545
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:24,830
That's right.
It's Dr. Kim Tae-hee.

546
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:37,970
<i>Baby.</i>

547
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:42,310
<i>I know it's painful and hard.</i>

548
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,230
It is for me too.
I'm about to lose my mind.

549
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,780
But why do we have to break up
because of this? Why?

550
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,700
I'll wait as long as you need it.

551
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:56,830
You'll be okay after some time.

552
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,000
Chung-ha.

553
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,340
I just can't stand myself.

554
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,970
Me, being alive and breathing

555
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,270
I'm disgusted by myself.

556
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:33,490
Struggling to form a family with you,

557
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,950
even this rain falling on me,

558
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,580
it's just all horrible.

559
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,210
I'm sorry.

560
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,980
TAE-HEE

561
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,580
So that you don't have
anything to worry about,

562
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,750
we will take great care of everything.

563
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:33,000
As you are also a friend of our employee,

564
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:36,630
we will be even more attentive.

565
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,680
Thank you. We will leave it to you.

566
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,220
How amazing.

567
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:44,850
Dong-joo.

568
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:51,770
I have never even imagined that
you would be sending my mother off.

569
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,150
We'll leave her to you.

570
00:44:58,450 --> 00:44:59,450
Yes, sir.

571
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,700
Look after

572
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,580
So-ra for us as well.

573
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:06,870
I will.

574
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:08,210
Thank you.

575
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:11,630
Dong-joo.

576
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:14,250
Go ahead to your friends.

577
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,300
Yes, go ahead.

578
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,060
What I regret the most is

579
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:34,980
every day

580
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:37,570
"Grandma,

581
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:39,950
who am I?"

582
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,740
I would ask her.

583
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:45,450
Trying to make sure

584
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,790
that she hasn't forgotten me.

585
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:55,630
Grandma struggled so hard every time.

586
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:01,090
What was so important
for her to recognize me

587
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,180
that I asked over and over again,
and eventually get disappointed?

588
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,770
I should have just said

589
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:15,150
"Grandma,

590
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,610
it's okay to forget everything."

591
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:20,820
I should have.

592
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:25,700
She even forgot about Dad who she loved
more than her own life.

593
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,790
She erased off yesterday,

594
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:33,960
and always only had today.

595
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:37,050
What was so important about that?

596
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,970
They say they take
all of the good memories.

597
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,470
She will remember everything.

598
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,770
Did you have

599
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:53,900
anything you

600
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:56,560
wanted to do for Grandma?

601
00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:57,940
Yesterday,

602
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:02,490
Grandma asked me

603
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,280
to clip her nails,

604
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:11,700
and I wasn't able to.

605
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:19,090
Hey! Bring another bottle of <i>Soju </i>here!

606
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,010
-Right away.
-What in the world…

607
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:25,590
Hey, lady.

608
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,890
What is wrong with him?

609
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:31,930
Who is that old guy?

610
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,140
I don't know. I guess Grandma knew him.

611
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:37,230
So annoying.

612
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,380
You did well today as always.

613
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:09,720
It's tomorrow, right?

614
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:11,810
The Coffining.

615
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:17,770
Yes.

616
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,980
So that you don't regret anything

617
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,910
Everything you wanted to say

618
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:29,320
or couldn't say,

619
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,830
you should go tell her.

620
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:38,880
She would be happy…

621
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,170
that until the very end

622
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,220
you were with her.

623
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,840
My little pumpkin.

624
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:30,930
When did you grow up so much?

625
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:40,020
Please don't leave, Grandma.

626
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:43,560
How can I not?

627
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:46,690
I'm blessed with you on my way.

628
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:51,280
I got to see you, Dong-joo.

629
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,280
Dong-joo.

630
00:49:56,540 --> 00:50:01,540
Thank you for taking good care
of this old grandma for this long.

631
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,460
So-ra has

632
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,840
also worked hard taking care of me.

633
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:16,890
How hard it must have been for her,
taking care of a broken grandma.

634
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,980
I should have left earlier so
my kids didn't have to struggle so much.

635
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:25,060
Though a part of me

636
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:28,690
wanted to go after I saw her get married.

637
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:33,660
To give So-ra as a wedding gift,

638
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:37,030
I prepared something with my bad skills.

639
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:41,870
My brain had become a rock
and I couldn't tell her.

640
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:47,210
You can tell So-ra to make sure
she takes it when she gets married, right?

641
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:49,340
Of course.

642
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:58,560
If I had a little more time,
I would have prepared one more.

643
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:03,020
I'm sorry.

644
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:07,520
No, I'm sorry.

645
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,030
And…

646
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:17,160
thank you so much for not taking
pity on me because I had no mother.

647
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,330
For being compassionate and loving to me.

648
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:31,090
Yes. I'll tell your mother
when I meet her.

649
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:36,930
I promise I'll tell her that
Dong-joo grew up beautiful and great.

650
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,010
Thank you.

651
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:42,230
Of course, I'm sure mom is
always watching over you.

652
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:48,900
Stop the crying, child.

653
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:56,910
Grandma is happy.
Happy that I got to see you before I go.

654
00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:01,790
Happy that I can talk to you
with a clear mind like this.

655
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:09,170
So-ra also, but Dong-joo,

656
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:12,130
find your match quickly.

657
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,340
Love is an amazing feeling.

658
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:21,600
There's nothing
more precious than that in this world.

659
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:23,890
When it's hard and tiring,

660
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:29,190
you remember those memories to endure
for the rest of your life.

661
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:34,530
The times I waited for So-ra's grandpa,
keeping the cooked rice warm.

662
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:38,410
Going past the town entrance

663
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,830
to greet So-ra's grandpa
coming home on a bicycle.

664
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:47,210
When he would pull out
roasted chestnuts from his clothes

665
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:51,170
that he kept in there just in case
it gets cold on the 10 <i>ri </i>way home.

666
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:55,380
When we would eat them together.

667
00:52:57,430 --> 00:53:00,510
You live thanks to those tiny moments.

668
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,640
Those memories will never, ever

669
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,350
be forgotten

670
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:09,150
or disappear.

671
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:16,110
Whether it rains or pours,

672
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,490
live your life loving.

673
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,280
Yes, ma'am.

674
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,120
Soon, there will be a day
you recognize him.

675
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:33,290
That miraculous moment will come to you.

676
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,920
Alright.

677
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,980
Grandma…

678
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:10,670
COFFIN ROOM
VIEWING ROOM

679
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:26,640
Grandma looked pretty.

680
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:28,640
What.

681
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:32,230
Thanks.

682
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,020
You're so amazing.

683
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:48,830
Why are you crying more than me?

684
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:02,050
-So-ra's mom, come out here.
-Yes.

685
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:08,010
Hey, girl! Get me some more of this.

686
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,480
<i>Ajeossi, </i>please leave.

687
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,940
-What?
-Please leave.

688
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,020
How many bottles did he have in two days?

689
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:20,150
You disrespectful bitch!

690
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:22,990
How dare you talk back to an adul--

691
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:24,820
Sir.

692
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,910
Sir, you must have had a lot to drink.

693
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,000
Who the hell are you?

694
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,380
The departure is
early morning tomorrow, and

695
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:40,800
the bereaved are cleaning up
and going home, so you should also go--

696
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:45,510
Sir, you shouldn't be doing this--

697
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,180
Sir!

698
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:53,680
-Should we go outside and have a smoke?
-Yeah?

699
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:57,400
Let us go then.

700
00:55:57,650 --> 00:55:58,650
Let go of me!

701
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:01,730
Sir, your shoes.

702
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,570
Cigarette. Give me cigarette.

703
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:05,530
Where's my cigarette?!

704
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:09,660
Let go of me!

705
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:13,000
Hey. Who do you think you are?

706
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Let go. Let go!

707
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,710
Leave.

708
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:26,630
Leave, I said.

709
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:30,640
Dad.

710
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:32,720
What do you think about that guy?

711
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,270
I'm fond of him.

712
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,560
Me too.

713
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,650
Did Grandma send him to me?

714
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:43,900
Why would she?

715
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,110
-Hm?
-Yeah.

716
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:52,660
Director.

717
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,210
Dong-joo. Thank you so much.

718
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:00,880
-It's nothing.
-Thank you, very much.

719
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,050
Thank you. We'll see you around.

720
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,520
Thank you.

721
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:27,530
By the way, Dong-joo.

722
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,030
I think Grandma

723
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:34,790
left me a gift.

724
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:38,960
I just feel that way.

725
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:43,000
You saw the gift?

726
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:47,170
Already?

727
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:50,220
Huh?

728
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,320
<i>Who would use this kind of blanket?</i>

729
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:20,540
This is for my granddaughter

730
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:23,630
when she gets married.

731
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,040
Grandma.

732
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:23,140
BONGSU CINEMA

733
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:37,200
I guess it's raining.

734
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:41,000
Yeah. I guess it's raining again.

735
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,580
Is that why others are late?
Traffic from the rain?

736
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:48,710
They'll be here.
They said they'd be on time.

737
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:53,720
Yes, Hae-an<i>.</i>

738
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,390
<i>-Dong-joo, what do I do?</i>
-What happened?

739
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,720
<i>You know the Sokyeong</i>
<i>arcade incident, right?</i>

740
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:02,350
<i>This has put</i>
<i>the entire department on edge.</i>

741
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:06,020
<i>They're telling all of us to do rounds.</i>
<i>Man, this sucks.</i>

742
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,230
Oh no. What do we do?

743
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:11,860
<i>I wanted to share a popcorn and watch</i>
<i>a movie at a multiplex theater with you.</i>

744
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:15,110
<i>Why did such a terrible crime have to</i>
<i>happen right now?</i>

745
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,660
<i>This really sucks.</i>

746
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,870
That's too bad.

747
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:21,450
Good luck. Bye.

748
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,540
<i>I don't think I can go.</i>

749
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:29,460
-Hae-an <i>ssi </i>says he can't make it.
-Neither can my uncle.

750
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:35,630
Then, we should leave too, right?

751
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:40,220
-Should we just watch it? The two of us?
-Huh?

752
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:44,770
-This is almost like we got ditched.
-It's whatever.

753
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:47,730
How about we do rock, paper, scissors?

754
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:53,480
-Do what the winner says.
-You want to watch the movie that bad?

755
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:56,200
-No.
-Then why?

756
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:01,700
It would be nice to say
we <i>chose </i>to go home.

757
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:09,290
Did you come here because you had
nothing to do? You made the time.

758
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:13,500
It sucks to just go home like this.
It's nice to feel good at least.

759
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:18,180
Okay, then.

760
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:20,720
-I'm gonna do rock.
-Huh?

761
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:23,560
Dong-joo <i>ssi, </i>you choose
however you want.

762
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:28,350
Rock, paper, scissors!

763
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:30,690
What?

764
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:32,770
-We're watching the movie.
-wha--

765
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:34,270
What I want.

766
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,610
I had some free time.

767
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:43,660
C'mon, let's go.

768
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:53,460
It's been a while.

769
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:03,970
Wow, it's been a while,
but they're all going in.

770
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:07,220
How is it for you?

771
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:12,310
Don't throw with both hands.
Left hand only holds, with a snap.

772
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,690
Like this.

773
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:24,240
I won't go easy.

774
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:28,790
I better defend.

775
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:41,340
Just you wait.

776
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:53,480
Please.

777
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:57,480
I did it!

778
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:01,200
Did you see that?

779
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:05,120
Amazing!
A stuffie worth 58000 Won!

780
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:16,290
-You're giving it to me?
-Yeah.

781
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,250
<i>-Did you go to the movies?</i>
-I didn't go.

782
01:03:56,830 --> 01:03:58,790
<i>Why? Why didn't you go?</i>

783
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:03,340
<i>You took the whole day off</i>
<i>to go with the girl next door.</i>

784
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,260
<i>You had an earful from</i>
<i>the station chief too.</i>

785
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:08,010
Just because.

786
01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:11,520
It's raining.

787
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:17,520
BONGSU CINEMA

788
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,670
Give me a minute.
I'll go get an umbrella.

789
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:41,130
Wait.

790
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:44,920
What's up?

791
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,520
Dong-joo!

792
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,560
Really?

793
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:53,780
There's no quiet day
with Baek Dong-joo.

794
01:05:54,830 --> 01:05:57,410
I was scared for no reason.
It's just nice and cool.

795
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:58,500
Huh?

796
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,500
The rain.

797
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:04,710
Every time it rained,

798
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:07,630
I always just waited for it to stop,

799
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:10,970
or waited for someone
to bring me an umbrella.

800
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:13,010
I didn't have to.

801
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:16,180
You just found out? At age 25?

802
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:23,770
Ever since I started the job,
I never thought to myself I was lonely.

803
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,400
Well,

804
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:31,990
I was about to for the first time,

805
01:06:36,370 --> 01:06:38,750
but then someone told me
not to chicken out.

806
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:55,760
Your eyes are all puffy.

807
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,810
It's nice out here today.

808
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:07,020
Just today?

809
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:10,150
Didn't you say you like rain?

810
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:12,820
It's a lie.

811
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:16,410
-Why would you lie about that?
-I wonder about that too.

812
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:19,660
I said something meaningless.

813
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:26,960
With that being said, it's raining,

814
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:29,170
so <i>Haemulpajeon?</i>

815
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:33,680
With <i>makgeolli?</i>

816
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:36,010
Sounds good.

817
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:39,430
Kim Tae-hee.

818
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:32,690
<i>Have you thought about me?</i>

819
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:34,190
<i>I want to move, too.</i>

820
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:35,360
<i>Do you guys know?</i>

821
01:08:35,610 --> 01:08:37,740
<i>Feeling concerned about someone.</i>

822
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:38,820
<i>First love?</i>

823
01:08:39,030 --> 01:08:40,030
<i>Yes.</i>

824
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:42,790
<i>-First love.</i>
<i>-Why are you lying?</i>

825
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:44,250
<i>It's true though.</i>

826
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:46,250
<i>-I'll get off here.</i>
<i>-Here?</i>
