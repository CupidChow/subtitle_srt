1
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,076
I'm sorry

2
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:38,414
for getting paid from a guy like that
and breaking your heart.

3
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:41,125
I'm sorry...

4
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,256
for not believing what you said.

5
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:50,426
I'm sorry

6
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,221
for lying to you
that you make me uncomfortable

7
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,974
and that I didn't like you.

8
00:00:58,184 --> 00:01:01,061
I'm sorry for not having the courage
to hold your hands when I wanted to

9
00:01:02,188 --> 00:01:04,315
and made you do it first.

10
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,110
I'm sorry for all that.

11
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:33,886
I like you.

12
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,482
Ouch.

13
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:30,234
Does that hurt?

14
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:32,570
I'm okay.

15
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:35,197
What do you mean?

16
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,324
Why are you like that?

17
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,577
I'm saying that because I really am okay.

18
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,912
Goodness. What am I gonna do with you?

19
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,206
What are you going to do?

20
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,585
What are you going to tell your boss?

21
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,297
Jeez. Your face is so scratched up.

22
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,091
It's going to leave a scar.

23
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,690
Nothing made me happy or sad.

24
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:15,988
I thought I had to live like that.

25
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,199
I wanted to become happy after I met you.

26
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,249
I'm never going...

27
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,629
to let go of your hands.

28
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:48,187
What was that?

29
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,066
-Look over there.
-Why?

30
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,154
I'm sorry.

31
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:01,700
After all,

32
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:05,245
isn't it all about looking at each other
between a man and a woman?

33
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,539
I think we're almost there.

34
00:04:07,957 --> 00:04:10,960
Goodness. Father, you know so much.

35
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,252
But Father,

36
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,380
I've always been curious...

37
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,841
What is it that you like about my nephew?

38
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,677
He's very reliable.

39
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,180
He knows Dong-joo very well
and he's very understanding.

40
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,015
Understanding?

41
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:27,643
How?

42
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,187
Why did you suddenly think of that?

43
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:31,897
Well...

44
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:36,902
I can say that his trust comes
from his appearance.

45
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:37,987
His appearance?

46
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,780
Jeez.

47
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,324
What are you mean all of a sudden?

48
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:48,372
So, since he is your nephew,
I have infinite trust.

49
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:54,753
Then, what about you, Brother?
Why are you cheering for the two of them?

50
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:57,047
You're even planning on the next plan.

51
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:02,177
You're acting as if your nephew
has to date because of some disease.

52
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,389
Well...

53
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:11,145
I'd glad to see Tae-hee move.

54
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:12,604
What?

55
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:14,148
Well...

56
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,942
It's fun to tease him with it.

57
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,363
Jeez. How mischievous of you.

58
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:33,167
Speaking of which,
I'll set up a meeting soon.

59
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,793
I'll set it up nicely.

60
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:38,047
Look forward to it, Father.

61
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:47,723
Does it hurt to hit you like this?

62
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,767
Or does hitting like this hurt?

63
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,186
Should I punch you down or up?

64
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,437
I'll get going.

65
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:54,772
Sure.

66
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,318
Jesus.

67
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,659
Shall we go to a movie
after work tomorrow?

68
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:10,662
Well...

69
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:11,914
Should I win you a doll?

70
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,041
Are you trying to pick up
another 50,000 won doll?

71
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,126
Goodness. What do you take me for?

72
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:18,462
But

73
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,881
I have a business trip tomorrow.

74
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,761
Business trip?

75
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,930
Why all of a sudden?

76
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:30,808
Where to?

77
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,477
To Cheonan. I'll be back in two days.

78
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,398
Two days?

79
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,318
I didn't know you go on business trips.

80
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,781
There are many elderly people
at the hospital in Seoul

81
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,992
but want to hold their funerals
in their hometown.

82
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,332
A grandmother died at a nursing hospital
and just one minute later

83
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:59,461
her husband died of a myocardial
infarction while picking persimmons.

84
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:00,754
Really?

85
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:02,673
Goodness.

86
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,219
-Have a safe trip.
-Okay.

87
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,763
Wait for me.

88
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:17,980
You said you wouldn't let go of my hands,
but you just did and looked at the sky.

89
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,232
I'll hold on to it tightly like this.

90
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:24,736
-Don't let go until we get home.
-Okay.

91
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:32,369
Let's eat.

92
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,956
Goodness. Goodness!

93
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,293
I've been cooking for you for 80 years.

94
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,879
Why did you follow me all the way here
to ask to cook for you more?

95
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,590
Then cook something simple

96
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:47,342
like noodles.

97
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,219
Easy for you to say!

98
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,054
It's not that simple to cook noodles.

99
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,056
-Excuse me...
-Miss.

100
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,642
You asked me for a wish earlier, right?

101
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:00,522
I want you to bury me separately
from this old man.

102
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:03,859
You have to tell my son to do so.

103
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,445
This old lady has gone senile.

104
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,906
Land is expensive,
so why bury us separately?

105
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:12,242
You're senile, you old man!

106
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:13,702
Goodness.

107
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:16,914
But miss,

108
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,708
did you tie up his clothes for him?

109
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:22,961
No, it wasn't me, but...

110
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,508
Goodness!

111
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:32,012
No matter how old you are,
you can't even tie your clothes!

112
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,681
Jeez.

113
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:37,559
You can't live without me.

114
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:40,187
Jeez. So frustrating.

115
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,439
That's why I followed you.

116
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:47,402
Goodness. You're not even well.

117
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,613
Why would you follow me here?

118
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,699
You said you want to eat it.

119
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:54,576
Goodness!

120
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,287
Jeez. You're such trouble!

121
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,122
Right, miss...

122
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,582
Could you...

00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:13,595

all of a sudden?

125
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,433
I heard she liked them.

00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:34,825

How'd you get here? It's far.

141
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,033
I came because I missed you.

You must be tired.

00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:10,754

Tae-hee.

148
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,352
If I ask you to pick persimmons,
can you pick them for me?

149
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:30,690
Not buying them, but actually climbing
the tree and picking them.

150
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:34,194
Persimmons?

151
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:36,446
You like persimmons?

152
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:41,368
Since you're tall,
can you just pick them?

153
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,122
Maybe not.
I guess the persimmon tree is taller.

154
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,207
Right.

155
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,167

Ta-da!

163
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,338
I picked a lot, right?

164
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,923
Goodness.

165
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,341

00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,242
Yes?

174
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:06,828
Something exciting?

175
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,039
-No.
-You sure?

176
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:17,589

179
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:31,853
Looks like you're surprised.

180
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,065
I didn't know you eat sweets things.

181
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,737
I, Seo Hae-an, would never
usually give this up.

182
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,781
But it's different for you.

183
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:45,033
It's fine. Take it.

184
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,077
Jeez. Just take it. It's fine.

185
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,372
Goodness. I'm so touched.

186
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:54,125
You're the only one who cares for me.

187
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:02,968
Jeez, we have similar taste.

188
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,600
This can be dangerous.

189
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,436
What? What is?

190
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,691
It comes out in criminal psychology.

191
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,901
The more similar you are

192
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,778
and the closer you are to someone,

193
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,072
the more chance
of betrayal by that person.

194
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:29,911
Jeez. I'm just joking.

195
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:32,414
Why are you so serious?

196
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,041
-Is that all for you?
-Yes.

197
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,126
I'll pay for you.

198
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,711
Are you serious?

199
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,212
-I'll pay together.
-Jeez.

200
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:41,381
-But different bags, please.
-Did you get paid?

201
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,550
Hold up, let me get rice too.

202
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,052
This is nice.

203
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,930
Five grain rice and black rice.
It's a party!

204
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:57,022
Not the rice, right?

205
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,155
Hey! Tae-hee!

206
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,573
We're in trouble!

207
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,284
Why? What is it?

208
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,536
The persimmons in the yard are gone!

209
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,371
They weren't even ripe.

210
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:17,584
No matter how bad the economy is,
how can someone steal raw persimmons?

211
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,169
They were red...

212
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,129
Very red...

213
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,548
-They weren't ripe?
-No, they weren't.

214
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,926
Jeez. There's a cop living in our house.

215
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,678
If he gets caught, he's dead.

216
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,556
-I'll get going.
-Hey, hold on.

217
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:34,476
You must come in by 7 o'clock today.

218
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,602
-Why?
-"Why?"

219
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,395
Stop talking back.

220
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,356
Do as I say so, you fool.

221
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,982
I'm your boss.

222
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,651
Okay.

223
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,861
-Come in at 7 o'clock.
-I said okay.

224
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,239
You don't need to be so aggressive.

225
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,450
I'll use martial arts.

226
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:54,871
Come in by 7 o'clock.

227
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,461
Anyway, those persimmons must be bitter.

228
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,177
Hello?

229
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,888
<i>Baek Dong-joo. Let's have lunch together.</i>

230
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:13,723
I'm at work.

231
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,100
<i>I'm at your work too.</i>

232
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:16,518
What?

233
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:22,023
-Why?
-I passed. I work at your hospital now.

234
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,193
So-ra.

235
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,655
Our hospital is hard to work at.

236
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:32,701
<i>All of the critically ill and emergency</i>
<i>patients in Bongsu district come here.</i>

237
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,536
Think carefully. Why do you think
you passed so easily?

238
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,912
I'm fine.

239
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,998
The team leader
will soothe my weary heart.

240
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,501
-Where are you now?
-Me? I'm at...

241
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:44,170
-Hey, I need to hang up.
-<i>Hey!</i>

242
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,508
Is this the pediatric cardiology ward?

243
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:51,678
May I know if the patient
has been discharged?

244
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,514
-The guardian's name is Kim Hyun-joo.
<i>-Sure.</i>

245
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,099
<i>What's the patient's name?</i>

246
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:59,978
I don't know the name of the patient.
I'm the guardian's friend.

247
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,065
<i>It is difficult to verify</i>
<i>the patient's personal information.</i>

248
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:05,233
<i>I apologize.</i>

249
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:08,903
I just need to know if the patient
has been discharged from the hospital.

250
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,281
<i>I apologize. That'd be hard.</i>

251
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,408
I see, okay.

252
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:16,828
I understand.

253
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,381
Goodness. You scared me!

254
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:29,966
Should I

255
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,718
look into it for you?

256
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,179
What? What do you mean?

257
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,515
You're the granddaughter.
What brings you here again?

258
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,642
No, I'm not "granddaughter".

259
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,146
-I'm Yoo So-ra.
-I see.

260
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:44,981
No, that's fine.

261
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,818
If you need anything, please tell me.
I work at this hospital now.

262
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:53,323
Are you a cardiac department nurse?

263
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,952
You said the guardian's name
was Kim Hyun-joo, right?

264
00:17:58,495 --> 00:17:59,662
I will contact you.

265
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,218
Thank you.

266
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,055
I want to have dinner with you.

267
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:19,682
The boss told you to come in early.

268
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,310
I want to watch a movie with you.

269
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:24,813
Shall we watch a movie late at night?

270
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,147
Shall we?

271
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,650
What time should we watch?

272
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:29,943
Well...

273
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,496
You scared me!

274
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,122
What's wrong with them, seriously?

275
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,833
What are you doing? Come in.

276
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:46,543
Come on in.

277
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:50,797
He's weird.

278
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,966
Come on in.

279
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,677
Wow, hyungnim.

280
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,846
You set up the place really well.

281
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,808
I should've
invited you over sooner, Father.

282
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:04,978
Let's eat first.

283
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:10,191
I've prepared the full course
from meals to recreation.

284
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,861
-Goodness.
-The dinner you mentioned...

285
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,070
-It was with my uncle?
-Thank you.

286
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,572
You didn't know Father was coming?

287
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:16,948
-Please sit.
-Sure.

288
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:18,491
Kim Tae-hee!

289
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,326
Come on. Set up the utensils.

290
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:21,703
Yes, of course.

291
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,079
Dong-joo, let's eat.

292
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,331
Please sit.

293
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,845
Now, let's dig in.

294
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,681
In the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,

295
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:42,765
amen.

296
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:43,850
Lord,

297
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,311
bless us with this food

298
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:48,438
you have graciously bestowed upon us.

299
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,273
Through Christ our Lord,

300
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,734
-amen.
-Amen.

301
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,819
-Shall we eat now?
-Yes.

302
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,946
Thank you for the food. Looks delicious.

303
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,574
We have to pair Chinese food
with Kaoliang liquor, aren't I right?

304
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,200
-Kaoliang liquor?
-Yes.

305
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,077
This one's alcohol percentage is low.

306
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:04,746
A DIME A JOB

307
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:07,999
On a day like this,

308
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,376
oriental games cannot be missed.

309
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:14,547
How about we simply bet
on the second round of beer, Father?

310
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,382
Since I'm a priest,

311
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,301
I'll sell out the "Gwang" card.

312
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,054
Okay, then.

313
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,682
Hyungnim, I'll do the dirty work.

314
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:26,684
Right, okay.

315
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,438
Whoever gets 15 points first.

316
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:33,608
-The rule is-
-The rules vary by region.

317
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,402
Today, we'll go with the national rule.

318
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:38,529
I see.

319
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,324
We'll go with "Jjok", "Tta-dak",
"Ppuk", "Ssueri".

320
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,742
There's also "mung-tung-goo-ri".

321
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,535
There's no "byung" and "sang-han-jeom".

322
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:52,460
As you know, "gwang-bak", "pi-bak",
and "go-bak" are considered to be double.

323
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:53,795
And "yuk-ggeu" is quadruple.

324
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,672
You're all familiar with
the unlimited liability, right?

325
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,590
Now, lastly,

326
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:59,509
if you're caught playing dirty...

327
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,260
That can't happen, okay?

328
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,224
Right, of course.

329
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,185
Brothers and sisters, play.

330
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,436
It's day and night.

331
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:11,980
I'll go first.

332
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,273
That's one,

333
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:15,775
eight, and ten.

334
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,610
Our Vincent Brother is in the lead.

335
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:18,695
Now, let's begin.

336
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,697
Then, I'll...

337
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:22,740
Go-do-ri.

338
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,742
Go!

339
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,452
Beginner's luck!

340
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:27,537
What?

341
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:32,917
Jeez.

342
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,794
What a loser.

343
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,587
You have to match
with the other card, you fool.

344
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:45,430
Father, what are you doing?

345
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:46,681
She is an amateur.

346
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:53,354
You already have two "gwang's".

347
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,029
-I'm trapped.
-You're trapped ugly.

348
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,489
Jeez. What are you going to do?

349
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,116
Peekaboo.

350
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,954
You're trapped again.

351
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:11,080
Goodness.

352
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,714
Give her two cards each.

353
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,300
-Two-go!
-It's two-go!

354
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,053
She has five "gwang's".

355
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:28,056
Tae-hee.

356
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:29,974
You're my only chance.
You have this card, right?

357
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:31,476
You have to take this, okay?

358
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:33,936
-I don't have it.
-You don't?

359
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:36,397
Take it.

360
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:38,316
Goodness.

361
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:40,193
You're such bad luck.

362
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,241
-Three-go!
-No.

363
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,452
James 1:15 verse.

364
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:52,455
"Then desire when it has conceived
gives birth to sin,

365
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,290
and sin when it is fully grown

366
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:57,919
brings forth death."
Stop.

367
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:03,674
Stop.

368
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:08,387
Shall we calculate the points now?

369
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,473
Five "gwang's," that's 15 points.

370
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,934
"Cho-dan," that's another three points.

371
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:14,435
"Ttee," another two points.

372
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,604
"Pi," another ten points.

373
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,523
And since you did two-go,
that's another two points.

374
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,233
That's 32 points.

375
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:23,319
Brothers, since you have
"gwang-bak" and "pi-bak,"

376
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,988
That's 64 points each
for a total of 128 points.

377
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,449
Do we all agree?

378
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:31,035
Yes, I admit my defeat.

379
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:33,830
Tae-hee, let's go.

380
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,581
Be generous and buy a lot.

381
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,750
-I'll buy a lot.
-Yes.

382
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:43,589
It's been a while
since I saw five "gwang's."

383
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,800
It's very rare.

384
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:53,432
It will be difficult
to carry all that alone, right?

385
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:55,017
I'll go to help.

386
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,811
What?

387
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:58,062
-Sure.
-Okay.

388
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:06,279
Here!

389
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:14,829
Let's go.

390
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:21,294
Wow.

391
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,379
That's fast paced.

392
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:25,339
He's doing well by himself.

393
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:27,341
By the way,

394
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:30,469
will there not be a 2nd round, then?

395
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,682
You said it'd be a full course today,
so I was really looking forward to it.

396
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:39,353
Of course there will be. Let's head out.

397
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:40,855
Okay.

398
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:48,613
Shouldn't we go in?

399
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,448
No, it's fine.

400
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,366
I feel like we should go back.

401
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,080
Look.

402
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:01,709
<i>We're now at Bongsu intersection bar,</i>

403
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:03,336
<i>in case you want to join.</i>

404
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,630
-You're right.
-I told you.

405
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:09,050
Then,

406
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:11,177
shall we watch a movie before we go back?

407
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,345
I'd love to.

408
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:17,058
What are you doing tomorrow?

409
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,727
Jeez. Are you planning on
going on a date everyday?

410
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:21,854
Yes.

411
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,107
Tomorrow...

412
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,818
Well, I have friends coming over.

413
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,445
-Your friends?
-Yes.

414
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:31,781
They're my closest friends.

415
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,700
So I'm going to tell them tomorrow

416
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:36,619
that I have a boyfriend.

417
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:38,621
Are you finally announcing it tomorrow?

418
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:40,539
How are you going to introduce me?

419
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:43,376
Should I appear in the middle
when you're introducing me?

420
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:44,961
Nope, you can't.

421
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:46,587
That can't happen.

422
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,382
-Why?
-Never. I'm serious.

423
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,634
You don't have to be so aggressive.

424
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,552
My friends are weird.

425
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:55,846
That can't happen.

426
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,892
Are your friends girls or guys?

427
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:07,358
<i>Hello?</i>

428
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,111
I'm here.

429
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:12,613
There was traffic.

430
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:14,949
I'm heading in now.

431
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:17,410
Take it out.

432
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:23,165
I'm holding your hands.

433
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:34,885
EONJU UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

434
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,602
Hey, what are you doing?

435
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:46,397
You look terrible.

436
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,107
Hey.

437
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,777
After being kicked out, are you living
in a cheap hotel room with nowhere to go?

438
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,281
Goodness. You're pathetic.

439
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:58,075
How are you still
not over someone like him?

440
00:26:58,284 --> 00:26:59,785
Kim Tae-hee, that bastard!

441
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:03,539
He was with some girl.

442
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:07,918
He was smiling
from ear to ear, laughing with joy!

443
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:16,260
So come to your senses, you fool.

444
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:19,513
You can't catch the heart
of a man who's already left you.

445
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:24,018
Are you worried for me?
Is that why you've chased me here?

446
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:25,978
To piss me off like this?

447
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:30,816
-Goodness.
-I don't understand what you're doing.

448
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,110
I can't understand you
with my common sense.

449
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,571
There's not a single thing
that I can understand!

450
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:38,949
If I were you, I wouldn't do this.

451
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:40,826
If you cared for me just a little.

452
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,287
If you worried for just a little.

453
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:46,457
I've been too easy on you.

454
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:48,125
How dare you yell at me?

455
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,462
Do you know why

456
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,674
I call you mother?

457
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,348
Because I feel sorry for you.

458
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,018
I have one regret.

459
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:08,813
But not anymore.

460
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:11,982
I don't pity you anymore.
And I never want to see you ever again.

461
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:19,865
Let's not see each other until we die.

462
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:30,876
Hey. Hey!

463
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:42,138
HERE IS A SELFIE

464
00:28:54,984 --> 00:28:56,318
-You happy?
-Goodness. You scared me.

465
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,906
How pretty.

466
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:02,283
Beautiful.

467
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:04,076
What?

468
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,579
-What is?
-The flowers.

469
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:08,289
Weren't you looking at the flowers?

470
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,791
-What's with the flowers, though?
-Well...

471
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,334
This is...

472
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,879
Was there a flower delivery request?

473
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:19,758
Yes, you're right.
I had a call to deliver flowers.

474
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:21,886
Stop messing around.

475
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:25,639
Hey, come to your senses and go to work.

476
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:27,308
It's Borang apartments'
recycling day, right?

477
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:29,560
Right! Yes, I almost forgot.

478
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,104
-Hurry up!
-I'll be back.

479
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:34,690
That fool.

480
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,030
Jeez.

481
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,499
Goodness. Time flies.

482
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:55,461
SCHEDULE FOR SEPTEMBER

483
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:11,894
SCHEDULE FOR OCTOBER

484
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,826
The sky's pretty.

485
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,161
The sky?

486
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,373
-It should be somewhere-
-It's here!

487
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,500
A Dime A Job...

488
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:38,003
High quality errand services...

489
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,263
Are you here for A Dime A Job?

490
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:49,056
How can I help you?

491
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,141
Kim Jip-sa?

492
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,644
Yes, that's me.

493
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:57,523
I see. You're Kim Jip-sa.

494
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:01,610
You don't look like a bad person.

495
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:03,112
Pardon?

496
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:04,488
Who are you?

497
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:08,742
Are you Dong-joo's friends?

498
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:11,662
How'd you know?

499
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:15,499
Well...That is...

500
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,209
Hey! What are you two doing?

501
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,671
-Hurry up!
-Okay, we'll go up.

502
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:24,758
-Well then, we'll get going.
-I'll see you next time.

503
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,512
You should look ahead when walking.

504
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:32,766
-Hurry up.
-Okay.

505
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:39,398
What? Hey!

506
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,609
Did you just say you two are dating?

507
00:31:41,692 --> 00:31:44,236
So those flowers are from...

508
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:47,072
When did this happen?

509
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:49,366
-Who asked who out first? How'd it happen?
-Hey.

510
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,410
-Ask me one at a time.
-Okay.

511
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,413
Did you sleep with him?

512
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,249
Let me just ask you this.
Did you sleep with him?

513
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:00,127
Mind your own business.

514
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:05,549
But how can you date the man
who said "Let's break up?" Seriously?

515
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:09,136
He's good-looking and tall.
That's all that matters.

516
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,596
He is good-looking, isn't he?

517
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,973
Jeez. Look at your smile.

518
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:16,101
You're lucky, Baek Dong-joo.

519
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,105
When will I start dating?

520
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:24,652
Now that you mention it, what will you do?
You even changed jobs.

521
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:26,862
What's an ex-girlfriend like?

522
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,572
Jeez. This is frustrating.

523
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,283
I'm so sick of it... No!

524
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:33,786
I have no choice but to endure.

525
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,829
I have to carry this burden with me.

526
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:37,790
What is she saying?

527
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:47,383
This is perfect match with tteokbokki.

528
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:50,678
Let's forget about ex-girlfriends
when we're eating.

529
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:53,972
You're eating a lot.

530
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:55,391
Weren't you on a diet?

531
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:57,726
Let's eat first, talk after.

532
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:00,562
Wow this is a new combo.

533
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:02,439
You should try it too. It's delicious.

534
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:08,737
How pretty.

535
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,330
Goodness.

536
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,709
Oh, hello.

537
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:23,919
I missed you!

538
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,176
I'm enjoying the kimchi.

539
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:32,594
Is that so?

540
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:34,722
-Does it fit your taste buds?
-Yes.

541
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:37,558
It's much more delicious than my mom's.

542
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,309
Jeez. You're kidding.

543
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:40,602
You're such a joker.

544
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:41,895
I'm serious.

545
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:43,731
Is Dong-joo doing well?

546
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,525
Right, Dong-joo.

547
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,861
Yes, she's doing just fine.

548
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,991
It's been several months since Dong-joo
left, but I still can't get used to it.

549
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:55,951
It's still awkward
coming into an empty house.

550
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,161
And depressing.

551
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,375
Buy me a drink next time.

552
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:05,711
Jeez. Yes, I'd love to.

553
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:07,504
How about before Autumn ends?

554
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,924
I've been craving a drink lately.

555
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:13,093
I needed a drinking buddy.

556
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:14,511
It's a promise, okay?

557
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:15,596
Yes, father.

558
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,431
Father?

559
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,308
Father?

560
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,935
That's really nice to hear.

561
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:28,025
For today, let's toast with this.

562
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,151
Yes, sir.

563
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,489
Father?

564
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,115
That's nice to hear.

Who is it?

574

It's Kim Tae-hee's friend's mother.

575
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:11,169
I see. The daughter
was the only chief mourner.

576
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,816
I'm your funeral director, Baek Dong-joo.

577
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,070
I'll be in charge of your mother.

I thought I should call you.

594
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:41,028
Thank you, Dong-joo.

595
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:44,573
Sure.

596
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,333
What's going on?

597
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,713
Chung-ha's mother passed away.

598
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:01,715
What? How?

599
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:03,884
From rupture of a cerebral aneurysm.

600
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,260
How'd that happen so suddenly?

601
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,721
She's a doctor herself.

602
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,347
Goodness.

603
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:13,685
Why did Dong-joo call?

604
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:16,480
No way...

605
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,398
Is she in charge?

606
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,901
Yes.

607
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,861
Jeez.

608
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:25,197
What the hell is this?

609
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:27,032
What are you going to do?

610
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:43,715
We're definitely

611
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:45,634
a karmic bond.

612
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:47,761
Excuse me?

613
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,514
I saw you

614
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:53,058
with Kim Tae-hee.

615
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:55,644
I see.

616
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,608
Can you make me a promise?

617
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:03,151
Will you

618
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:06,780
listen carefully to me?

619
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:10,951
Yes.

620
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:14,621
How can I trust you?

621
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:18,875
You're right.

622
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:21,628
Of course you'd feel that way.

623
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:23,130
But

624
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,465
you don't have much time.

625
00:40:30,554 --> 00:40:31,763
How does

626
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:35,851
my daughter look to you?

627
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:42,149
She looks lonely.

628
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,628
<i>I didn't want to pass on my luck to her,</i>

629
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:05,589
that loneliness.

630
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:09,134
Please let that loneliness go away.

631
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:12,429
Put my daughter

632
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,183
back to where she belongs.

633
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,025
Thank you for coming, Vincent.

634
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,236
Of course I would come.

635
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,950
Right, Tae-hee...

636
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:35,702
He had something else.

637
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:37,954
I see.

638
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,627
Contact me anytime if you need anything.

639
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:53,261
You didn't eat anything today.

640
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:59,309
You should eat while it's still warm.

641
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,193
You should get some sleep
after you finish eating.

642
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:06,042
Jeez.

643
00:43:06,293 --> 00:43:07,919
I was dying to see you.

644
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,088
How long have you been waiting?

645
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,381
Not too long.

646
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,049
Did you eat?

647
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:14,801
You should've called.

648
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,303
How long did you wait?

649
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,765
Let's go.

650
00:43:27,314 --> 00:43:29,441
Vincent came earlier.

651
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:34,195
I heard.

652
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:37,240
Why didn't you come?

653
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:39,534
If...

654
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:41,870
you didn't come because of me...

655
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:44,622
Don't do that.

656
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,260
It's not because of you.

657
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:01,890
If you don't go,

658
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:04,392
you'll regret it later on.

659
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:11,983
You two dated for so long,
so it's normal to care.

660
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:15,612
But...

661
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,784
I wish there's no more than that

662
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:22,410
for the two of you.

663
00:44:25,622 --> 00:44:27,165
So you should come.

664
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:29,626
Okay?

665
00:44:37,384 --> 00:44:38,385
Let's go.

669
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:26,474
I'm sorry,

670
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,436
but I can't grant you that.

671
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:33,648
I like Tae-hee too.

672
00:45:38,445 --> 00:45:39,779
He belonged to Chung-ha.

673
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,324
She had him first.

674
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:57,088
<i>If you don't come,</i>

675
00:45:57,797 --> 00:46:00,258
<i>you'll regret it later on.</i>

676
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:03,595
<i>So come and say good-bye.</i>

677
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:41,145
Wow. Kim Tae-hee came.

678
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:45,149
Chungha didn't cry once,
but she bursted out when she saw Taehee.

679
00:49:45,233 --> 00:49:47,026
Are they getting back together?

680
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:49,320
There's a high possibility.

681
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:50,697
Very high.

682
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:53,199
It's good to start over
after an incident like this.

683
00:49:53,408 --> 00:49:54,701
The fact that he came.

684
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:57,036
It's better to pretend
not to know when you break up.

685
00:49:57,954 --> 00:49:59,622
I didn't go to Yeon-ji's mother's funeral.

686
00:49:59,706 --> 00:50:00,707
That's different.

687
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:02,417
They dated for so long.

688
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,837
I'm telling you, they're different.
The two of them have something.

689
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,923
If he proposed and got married,
they would already have a child by now.

690
00:50:10,383 --> 00:50:12,552
That's a lot to worry about.

691
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:15,138
Don't you know that the more twists
and turns there are, the deeper it is?

692
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:16,514
No, I don't know.

693
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:43,583
I was looking for you earlier.

694
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,252
I wanted to see you before I left.

695
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:47,670
I see.

696
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:51,966
I was busy preparing
for the departure for tomorrow.

697
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:06,564
I felt bad all day...

698
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:12,069
because I went today

699
00:51:12,612 --> 00:51:15,114
and made you hear things
you shouldn't have.

700
00:51:18,618 --> 00:51:20,036
But those words...

701
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:23,790
There is no need to listen to them.

702
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:26,584
No need to worry.

703
00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:30,171
No need to be upset.

704
00:51:31,506 --> 00:51:33,633
Because you're all I need.

705
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:41,933
I will only make you smile.

706
00:51:43,893 --> 00:51:44,936

00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:22,658
-I feel bad.
-Grandma!

728
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:24,577
Jeez. My sweet boy.

729
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:26,871
You should've called me.

730
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:30,458
I came here because I missed you.

731
00:53:31,626 --> 00:53:32,710
Right, well...

732
00:53:33,002 --> 00:53:34,086
This is my grandma.

733
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:36,714
I see, hello.

734
00:53:37,173 --> 00:53:38,215
Hello.

735
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:42,094
Vincent?

736
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:44,639
-Mom, well...
-Hey.

737
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:48,267
Your dad worked so hard to help you study.

738
00:53:48,351 --> 00:53:50,061
Your name is just fine.

739
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:52,563
-What the hell is "Vincent"?
-Jeez.

740
00:53:52,647 --> 00:53:54,231
You should calm down.

741
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:57,526
So why did you name me Hyang-bok?

742
00:53:57,610 --> 00:54:00,112
Hyang-bok isn't a business worthy name.

743
00:54:00,196 --> 00:54:01,197
You fool!

744
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,282
If you were gonna do something foolish,
you should've done it alone.

745
00:54:03,366 --> 00:54:06,619
Why'd you take my nephew
and make him do hard work?

746
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,081
My sweet boy.

747
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:13,668
He's lost so much weight.

748
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,628
You look like you starved yourself.

749
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:17,254
No grandma, I'm really fine.

750
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:19,215
-I'm doing fine.
-Goodness.

751
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:23,469
This isn't a small errand.
It's a daily life service.

752
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:26,681
The world has changed a lot.
This is a business.

753
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:29,308
I'll paid off all the investment
my brother-in-law gave me.

754
00:54:29,392 --> 00:54:32,353
I'll get you an apartment
at Gang-nam with a Han River view.

755
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:33,729
Hey!

756
00:54:33,813 --> 00:54:35,731
Stop with Gang-nam!

757
00:54:35,815 --> 00:54:37,942
Gang-nam isn't all that good.

758
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:39,735
Now that I'm here,

759
00:54:39,819 --> 00:54:42,405
let me cut your hair.

760
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:45,825
What's wrong with you?

761
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:46,909
Goodness.

762
00:54:46,993 --> 00:54:49,245
Take those scissors away from her.

763
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:50,746
Goodness.

764
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:52,957
Take those scissors.

765

00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:20,252
Grandma.

776
00:56:21,754 --> 00:56:23,172
My sweet boy.

777
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:24,965
What's wrong? Can't sleep?

778
00:56:25,758 --> 00:56:27,468
And why aren't you sleeping?

779
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,846
I can't put myself to sleep.

780
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:35,059
The weather's so nice.

781
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:37,728
It's only a few days in a year.

782
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:41,774
Goodness. How bitter.

783
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:50,950
It will all pass.

784
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:53,994
But

785
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:55,663
people

786
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:58,165
should have a job.

787
00:57:00,793 --> 00:57:03,003
You should be a doctor again.

788
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:08,467
Don't let your mom wait so long.

789
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:13,597
For your mom,

790
00:57:14,515 --> 00:57:15,891
you're all she has.

791
00:57:17,977 --> 00:57:19,937
If you make your mom upset,

792
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:22,857
I'll be upset with you too.

793
00:57:31,282 --> 00:57:33,826
All mothers pity their children.

794
00:57:35,244 --> 00:57:36,328
You too,

795
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,914
your mother,

796
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:41,792
and my youngest sweet boy.

797
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:45,880
Except for your uncle,

798
00:57:46,589 --> 00:57:47,798
I feel bad for all.

799
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:26,962
I was waiting to go with you.

800
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:28,797
You did?

801
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:31,759
Hello, miss.

802
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,093
You're up early.

803
00:58:33,302 --> 00:58:34,470
Hello.

804
00:58:35,304 --> 00:58:37,181
-Are you going to exercise?
-Yes.

805
00:58:37,473 --> 00:58:38,766
Do you want to come with?

806
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,142
Shall I?

807
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:41,518
Let's go.

808
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:51,779
Where did it go?

809
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:55,532
Darn it. Does it have legs?

810
00:59:00,955 --> 00:59:02,456
<i>Yes, Seo Hae-an.</i>

811
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:04,917
Yes, good morning to you.

812
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,502
Not a good morning for me.

813
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:08,003
What's up?

814
00:59:08,087 --> 00:59:09,129
<i>Well...</i>

815
00:59:09,505 --> 00:59:11,382
<i>Do you have a screwdriver?</i>

816
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,385
<i>-I can't find it anywhere.</i>
-Screwdriver?

817
00:59:15,636 --> 00:59:16,679
Come on down.

818
00:59:18,806 --> 00:59:21,642
How are you so pretty?

819
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,439
You're just like my daughter
when she was younger.

820
00:59:27,523 --> 00:59:29,358
-Grandma, I need to take this call.
-Sure.

821
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:31,277
Please take care of my grandma.

822
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:34,697
-My daughter is Tae-hee's mother.
-I see.

823
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:37,449
She was pretty when she was younger.

824
00:59:37,533 --> 00:59:39,410
-Was she?
-Yes.

825
00:59:40,286 --> 00:59:42,454
You remind me of my daughter.

826
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:45,291
Hold on.

827
00:59:45,374 --> 00:59:47,501
What's that? I'll be back.

828
00:59:48,377 --> 00:59:49,503
Where's she going?

829
00:59:50,004 --> 00:59:51,005
Grandma!

830
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:52,715
Where's she going?

831
00:59:58,345 --> 01:00:01,473
Your grandma is cute.

832
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:04,768
Is your mom like her too?

833
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:07,062
My mom?

834
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,859
No, I don't think she's cute.

835
01:00:12,776 --> 01:00:15,612
-She'll be here in a few days.
-Your mother too?

836
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:18,907
It's the anniversary
of my brother's death.

837
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,285
I see.

838
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,247
When is it?

839
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:28,834
It's the ninth.

840
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:30,919
The ninth?

841
01:00:33,005 --> 01:00:34,006
Tae-hee.

842
01:00:35,174 --> 01:00:36,175
I need water.

843
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:37,926
Okay.

844
01:00:39,386 --> 01:00:41,805
-I'll go to the convenience store.
-Sure.

845
01:00:46,477 --> 01:00:47,478
Here.

846
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:52,191
Goodness. It's rare to find
younger people carrying this.

847
01:00:52,441 --> 01:00:55,152
You're so considerate.

848
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:57,613
Wait.

849
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,531
How old are you?

850
01:00:59,948 --> 01:01:01,950
I'm 25 years old.

851
01:01:02,618 --> 01:01:06,080
Goodness. That is such a good age.

852
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:07,456
Are you a student?

853
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,042
-No.
-I see...

854
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:12,461
Do you work in an office?

855
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:13,921
I'll try to guess.

856
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:17,758
You teach children in kindergarten.

857
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:19,134
Well...

858
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:21,595
I'm a funeral director.

859
01:01:23,263 --> 01:01:24,973
A funeral doctor.

860
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:31,397
How did such a pretty lady
do such a horrifying job?

861
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:33,941
Goodness.

862
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:37,986
You should find another job

863
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:39,905
with Tae-hee together.

864
01:01:40,489 --> 01:01:41,490
Excuse me?

865
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:45,869
Tae-hee

866
01:01:47,413 --> 01:01:48,622
was a doctor.

867
01:01:49,957 --> 01:01:50,999
Right.

868
01:01:52,084 --> 01:01:53,127
Yes.

869
01:01:58,006 --> 01:01:59,299
Wow.

870
01:01:59,508 --> 01:02:01,927
Vincent, I'm here.

871
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:03,303
Did you eat?

872
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:05,055
-Not yet.
-Good.

873
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:06,682
I've made Al tang and it's delicious.

874
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:08,183
Jeez, Al tang?

875
01:02:09,435 --> 01:02:11,687
Well... Where's the screwdriver?

876
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:13,480
I'll fix it quick and come back down.

877
01:02:13,564 --> 01:02:15,566
-Look in the toolbox over there.
-The toolbox.

878
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,101
<i>Sir.</i>

879
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:54,605
<i>Please save me.</i>

880
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:58,817
<i>Sir.</i>

881
01:03:00,068 --> 01:03:02,070
<i>Please save me.</i>

882
01:03:23,634 --> 01:03:24,718
Hyung.

883
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:28,597
<i>Hyung.</i>

884
01:03:34,102 --> 01:03:35,145
Hey!

885
01:03:38,065 --> 01:03:40,400
What's wrong with you?

886
01:03:42,611 --> 01:03:43,695
You forgot to take this.

887
01:03:46,365 --> 01:03:47,449
Right.

888
01:03:47,533 --> 01:03:49,535
Jeez. Here.

889
01:03:51,662 --> 01:03:55,165
Goodness. I must be out of my mind.

890
01:03:58,293 --> 01:04:00,671
-I'll get going.
-Seo Hae-an.

891
01:04:02,631 --> 01:04:03,632
Yes?

892
01:04:04,925 --> 01:04:06,051
You're okay, right?

893
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:11,181
Yes, of course.

894
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:13,809
-Go up.
-Okay.

895
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:29,199
Jeez. My heart swells
when I think of my grandchild.

896
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:30,826
Because of his younger brother...

897
01:04:32,077 --> 01:04:33,120
How pitiful.

898
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:36,164
That's why I came all the way here.

899
01:04:36,999 --> 01:04:40,210
What time is it now?

900
01:04:41,253 --> 01:04:42,254
Goodness.

901
01:04:47,676 --> 01:04:49,678
-Grandma.
-Yes?

902
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:51,513
This is my grandchild.

903
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:53,265
He's good-looking, right?

904
01:04:57,394 --> 01:04:58,437
Wait...

905
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:00,856
This boy...

906
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:02,816
Yes.

907
01:05:03,734 --> 01:05:05,193
Tae-hee's younger brother.

908
01:05:06,278 --> 01:05:07,362
Our youngest.

909
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:25,672
Grandma!

910
01:05:27,049 --> 01:05:28,508
<i>I have a younger brother.</i>

911
01:05:31,011 --> 01:05:32,220
<i>My younger brother...</i>

912
01:05:39,019 --> 01:05:40,270
Because of me...

913
01:05:44,733 --> 01:05:45,817
Because of me,

914
01:05:50,906 --> 01:05:52,074
he died.

915
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:30,195
<i>I'll get going first.</i>

916
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:32,406
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>you had such a young brother.</i>

917
01:06:32,823 --> 01:06:35,659
<i>I've heard that someone</i>
<i>was at the place of Jun-ho accident.</i>

918
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:37,828
<i>I think he should be punished</i>
<i>even if he dies.</i>

919
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:39,329
<i>Tae-hee, you need to live.</i>

920
01:06:39,621 --> 01:06:41,707
<i>You need to live and remember.</i>

921
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:45,585
<i>I met your younger brother.</i>
