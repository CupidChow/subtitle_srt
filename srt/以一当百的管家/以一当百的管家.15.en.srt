1
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,780
Well...

2
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,580
Can I ask you something first?

3
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,380
What?

4
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,630
You know, the cigarettes
that my older brother used to smoke.

5
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,260
How did you find that out?

6
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,650
Just tell me. I'm curious, that's all.

7
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:08,570
You can tell me, right?

8
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,120
I believe everything you say, Dong-joo.

9
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,450
I agree with everything you say.

10
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,100
Don't be like this.

11
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,150
Tell me.

12
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,530
Your older brother...

13
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,290
I met him.

14
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,410
Ouch.

15
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,040
Hurry and tell me.

16
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,010
How did you find out?

17
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,620
Stop it.

18
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,640
Dong-joo.

19
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,650
I'm sorry.

20
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,780
Dong-joo, are you okay?

21
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,570
Dong-joo

22
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,790
Dong-joo.

23
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,040
What happened?

24
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,370
Are you okay?

25
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,710
Tae-hee. Go.

26
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,300
Hurry.

27
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,430
I bought one pack of beer

28
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,760
Hey! Where are you going?

29
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,020

Take care of Dong-joo.

32
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,480

33
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,980

00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,740
Dong-joo, what's wrong? Are you okay?

37
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,910
Police...

38
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,620
Call the police please.

39
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,330

43
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,940

-Nice work, Hae-an.

45

Sir.

46
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,570
Please save me.

47
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:54,040
I'm going to get stronger
and catch all the bad guys.

48
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,340
I'm also going to catch all the people
who are rude to you.

49
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,690
I'm never going to forgive you.

50
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,770
Even if I re-think it a thousand times...

51
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,820
I can't forgive you.

52
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,150
Hurry and sleep.

53
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,980
Once you wake up,

54
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,570
your headache will go away

55
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,700

57
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,690
There was...

58
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,070
something I had
to tell your older brother.

59
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,910

60
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,870

00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,610

67
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,510
I just...

68
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,930
wanted to be like others

69
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,850
and have a normal life.

70
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,680
If I desire it earnestly,

71
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,440
then it should've been granted.

72
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,150
Don't try to reason yourself.

73
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,450
Everything's an excuse.

74
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,050

75
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,170
Everything's over now.

76
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:43,770
I'm sorry.

77
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,060
I should've protected you.

78
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,980
You've done enough.

79
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,660

He won't talk.

86
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,380
I'm sorry, sir.

87
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,090
We plan to re-investigate

88
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,760
the Bongsu market accident.

89
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,810
Sure.

90
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,020
I apologize.

00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,820
I'm sorry, Dong-joo.

93
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,000
I've done something I shouldn't have done.

94
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,380
I'm really...

95
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,460
really sorry.

96
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,850
I didn't come here
to hear that you're sorry.

97
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,400
I'm here because
I have something to tell you.

98
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,200
Your older brother...

99
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,790
asked me to tell you this.

100
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:57,130
I don't know if you're doing this because
you want to hear something from me.

101
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,130
I'm the one who hit him. It's me.

102
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,720
So stop with the questions.

103
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,840
And get me cigarettes.

104
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,680
Don't you feel bad for Hae-an?

105
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,480
Do you know my younger brother?

106
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:14,940
Jeez.

107
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,230
What a small world.

108
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,110
Goodness.

109
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,440
Then,

110
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,280
can you tell Hae-an something for me?

111
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,960
That the person who made me like this,

112
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,210
isn't you.

113
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,880
It's myself.

114
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,960
So,

115
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,800
to not think about me

116
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,720
nor our father.

117
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,300
And to not feel sorry.

118
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,220
To not be afraid. And just...

119
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,980
to do whatever you want to do.

120
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,060
And live happily

121
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,320
without any worries.

122
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,700
To not let my words

123
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,870
stay in your heart for long.

124
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,410
I'll take all the burden with me.

125
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,090
So just live normally like others.

126
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,960
Please tell him that.

127
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,680
I beg you.

128
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,940
I beg you.

129
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,240
He knew that...

130
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,830
you became a police officer

131
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,120
and that you moved.

132
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,960
The stuff you said at the ICU,

133
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,470
he heard everything.

134
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,060
I thought that

135
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,350
I'd be happy now.

136
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,770
But I guess not.

137
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,710
Please just go now.

138
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,800
Think about me.

139
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,400
That day,

140
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,030
he said he's the one who drove

141
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,330
and that he's the one
who caused the accident.

142
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,790
He kept repeating that.

143
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,890
I have a favor to ask.

144
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,250
On the day of the accident,

145
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,250
my older brother

146
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,920
had a chip inserted in the black box.

147
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,700
CERTIFICATE OF COMMENDATION

148
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,000
Right after the accident,

149
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,330
I had it

150
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,000
taken out.

151
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,670
I didn't have the courage
to turn myself in

152
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,680
nor the courage to throw it away.

153
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,760
So I kept it.

154
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,230
Dong-joo,

155
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,400
can you turn it in for me?

156
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,180
Driving under influence,
murder on the run under the Special Act,

157
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,760
two deaths,

158
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,680
changing drivers, interference with
police in the execution of his duties,

159
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,020
lack of accountability
under the police oath,

160
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,730
and destruction of evidence.

161
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,020
Do you have anything to say?

162
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,740
There's...

163
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,040
someone I'd like to meet.

164
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,190
Why did you do it?

165
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,910
I said, why did you do it?

166
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,500
I'm sorry.

167
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,980
I'll live.

168
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,310
I won't die.

169
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,740
I'll suffer from guilt.

170
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,660
And live no matter what...

171
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,830
for the rest of my life.

172
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:35,920
Tae-hee.

173
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,580
You should eat.

174
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,210
I'll leave it in front of your door.

175
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,020
Goodness.

176
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:09,990
Tae-hee.

177
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,660
I bought an amazing samgyetang.

178
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,330
Eat it, okay?

179
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,020
Hey.

180
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,110
I made pork rice bowl.

181
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,360
You better eat this time.

182
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,790
What a brat.

183
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,580
Hey! Open the door.

184
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,170
Open up.

185
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,960
Darn it.

186
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,560
Hey!

187
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,310
At least chew some gum!

188
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,310
Tae-hee.

189
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,570
I bought a lottery ticket.

190
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,200
I'll only let you know when I win.

191
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:16,490
Then, you'll be so jealous.

192
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,080
What?

193
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:20,910
What the...?

194
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,500
Oh my God. Hey!

195
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,380
Tae-hee. Come out!

196
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:26,840
Hey! Oh my God!

197
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,090
Hey! The lottery...

198
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,760
I lost. Darn it.

199
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,040
Hi Dong-joo.

200
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,170
How are you feeling?

201
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,840
I'm good.

202
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,510
-What's with the flowers?
-Right. Here.

203
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,760
What?

204
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,720
They're beautiful, aren't they?
Flowers have the power to calm the mind.

205
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,560
They reduce stress
and increase the happiness index.

206
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,140
Is that so?

207
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,730
Wow, they smell so good!

208
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,610
Just looking at them makes me feel better.

209
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,230
Thank you.

210
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,450
Right. Can you give them to Tae-hee?

211
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,740
Right. Well...

212
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,410
Oh, I thought they were for me.

213
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,620
Dong-joo.

214
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,080
Do you want to come in?

215
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,420
No, I'll wait.

216
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,330
Tae-hee.

217
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,540
Tae-hee.

218
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:56,780
I'm sorry.

219
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,150
Why?

220
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,040
It's not because of you.

221
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,590
It's not your fault.

222
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,930
Thank you, Tae-hee.

223
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,300
It's so nice to be here with you.

224
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,390
I'm glad we're watching it together.

225
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,770
Wow, look at the stars.

226
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:52,700
FINAL WORDS OF GOOD-BYE

227
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,880
The weather is pretty chilly now.

228
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,510
Jeez.

229
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,600
Those fools.
In front of the elderly living alone...

230
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,190
Never mind.

231
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,730
I've declared not to marry.

232
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,360
I am voluntarily not marrying.

233
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,370
Michael.

234
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,540
STOP BY

235
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,880
-Sam-sam.
-What?

236
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,300
Uncle. Uncle.

237
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,180
-Sam-sam.
-I see.

238
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:50,800
Uncle and uncle.

239
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,480
I wanted to see you soon.

240
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,360
You've suffered a lot from the incident.

241
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,690
Jeez.

242
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,150
More than me,

243
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,820
Tae-hee is having hard time.

244
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,240
Still, my nephew seems to be very lucky.

245
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,370
He has Dong-joo.

246
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,920
The more I see her,
she seems like a good person.

247
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,840
He's got good luck!

248
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,960
More than that.

249
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,460
He hit a grand slam.

250
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,970
He changed his life with a grand slam.

251
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,430
You're over complementing her.

252
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,430
She's still

253
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,520
got a lot to learn.

254
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,430
By the way,

255
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:41,100
is there really such a thing as fate?

256
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:45,190
Originally, I didn't believe
in such a fantasy.

257
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:47,650
Is that why

258
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,320
you declared your non-marriage?

259
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,410
It doesn't mean that I'll never withdraw.

260
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,320
I didn't say that.

261
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,780
But...

262
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,790
even so,

263
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,660
you should still believe.

264
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,710
That it's destiny.

265
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:02,370
That it's love.

266
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,500
That it recognizes each other.

267
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,300
Just like us, sam-sam's?

268
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,260
Let's go all the way

269
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,340
to Silvertown together, okay?

270
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,680
-No.
-What?

271
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:19,600
What a miser.

272
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:32,740
I've prepared it
in a larger portion for you.

273
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:35,320
I feel like a lot of things
have been resolved.

274
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,030
Even if you, Stella,

275
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,540
don't have 80%,

276
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,700
you have at least 50% stake.

277
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,370
No, not at all.

278
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,380
Those hands...

279
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,010
Do you still think

280
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,640
they aren't a gift?

281
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,900
Who could be the last person?

282
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,610
The person who is destined

283
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,240
to meet Stella's hands.

284
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,000
Will you tell me
after I meet the last person?

285
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,040
The secret behind my hands.

286
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,170
What?

287
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,440
LARGE-SCALE FIRE IN THE 4-STORY BUILDING
OF BONGSU ELECTRIC IN SEOUL

288
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:15,090
21 PEOPLE DIE
IN BONGSU ELECTRIC BUILDING FIRE ACCIDENT

289
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,510
Hey, where are you going?

290
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,890
To work. I'll be back.

291
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,310
Oh, right.

292
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,350
Be safe.

293
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,940
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

294
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,690
This week has been really tough.

295
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,820
Same here.

296
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,240
It's been so tough.

297
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,490
Let's eat and cheer up.

298
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,240
Wow.

299
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,540
-It's delicious.
-Here.

300
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,960
For you too.

301
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,130
It's tasty.

302
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,210
It's even better with the meat.

303
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,800
I...

304
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,590
This morning,

305
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,060
I sent a gifticon to the Il-seob.

306
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,650
You don't nag anymore.

307
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:12,060
Whatever. Do as you like.

308
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,900
Sure!

309
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,280
It's Il-seob.

310
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,660
Thank you so much.

311
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,170
Hey. Go to work.

312
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,670
What about you?

313
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:33,540
I'm off today.

314
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,250
I only have afternoon lessons today.

315
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,840
Shall we go watch a movie together?

316
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,590
Period. Period.

317
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:42,550
"Thank you so much."

318
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,430
"Thank you so much."

319
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,520
Wow.

320
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,600
What the?

321
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,020
-Hello.
-"Thank you so much?"

322
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,110
Excuse me?

323
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:55,440
What does it mean
when a guy says "thank you so much?"

324
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,530
-What?
-"Thank....

325
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:00,070
You... So...

326
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,030
Much."

327
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,410
"Thank you so much?"

328
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:08,790
Well...

329
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,040
That is...

330
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,750
That just means thank you.

331
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,670
That's it?

332
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,010
Then, what's with
the two period's in the end?

333
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,380
There are two periods.

334
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,340
What does it mean
when a guy uses two periods?

335
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,550
Let's grab food?

336
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,680
Or let's go drink?

337
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,850
He's hitting on me, right?

338
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,310
Should I go for it?

339
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,980
Go for it.

340
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,750
I'm here to fight head-on.

341
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,920
I think you've been doing it all along.

342
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,090
So you know.

343
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,550
That's worth the effort.

344
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,720
Well then, have a great day today.

345
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:14,850
Hey, granddaughter.

346
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,780
Have you had...

347
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,080
lunch?

348
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:39,880
Tae-hee!

349
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,550
Hey!

350
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:45,050
Oh my God. Oh my God!

351
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,760
What's with you? What is it?

352
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,760
1000 clients.

353
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,230
Hey, you brat.

354
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,190
What's with your reaction?

355
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,520
Aren't 100,000 people
the default these days?

356
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:04,440
We're in the Bongsu district.
These are all our actual customers.

357
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,360
That's exactly what I'm saying.

358
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,450
Jeez. I'm talking about
hiring more people.

359
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:14,750
What?

360
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,630
Why?

361
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,590
You're

362
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,420
staying here?

363
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,300
KIM HAE-YEON - CHEER

364
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,300
So, you're really

365
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,510
staying here, right?

366
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:36,560
Where else would I go?

367
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,190
Yeah, exactly.

368
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,190
Go ahead. Keep working.

369
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,780
Hey.

370
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,240
It's not time for us to be idle like this.

371
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,620
We've got a lot to do.

372
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,160
A DIME A JOB
CHAT

373
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,670
Anyway,

374
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,920
we should

375
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,430
focus on our VIP clients.

376
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,480
Jeez.

377
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,690
What the?

378
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,360
What...

379
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:34,410
Hi Dong-joo.

380
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,580
Why is everyone here?

381
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,840
Dad?

382
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,340
Jeez. My eyes are burning.

383
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,880
-Dad--
-I asked because I had to make kimchi!

384
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:53,180
-Why? What?
-Who makes kimchi nowadays?

385
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,430
I like making it myself.

386
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,310
Why do you make just kimchi every time?

387
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,730
Even if you run out of rice,
you should never run out of kimchi.

388
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,850
Are you trying to share it
with the whole neighborhood?

389
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,940
I wish he did.

390
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,770
I'll get some kimchi later too.

391
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,900
Yes, of course.

392
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:08,990
But where's the cabbage?

393
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:10,860
It's in the bathroom.

394
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:12,700
Bathroom. Tae-hee, let's go.

395
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,780
Okay.

396
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,500
Dad.

397
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:30,340
I made 70 bundles last year, but it wasn't
enough. So I'm making 200 this year.

398
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,470
Goodness.

399
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,590
Last year, I bought pickled cabbage,

400
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,050
but I couldn't eat it
because it was too bitter.

401
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,520
I don't think they used the right salt.

402
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,560
Squeeze the water out completely
and bring them out.

403
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,640
Yes, sir.

404
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:45,980
Goodness.

405
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,530
They look delicious.

406
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,150
Did you grind all the red pepper powder?

407
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,910
Don't you know how important
red pepper powder is when making kimchi?

408
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,160
No, and I don't care.

409
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:56,740
I wish you knew.

410
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:58,990
I cleaned them one by one.

411
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:01,500
There was so much dust in the peppers.

412
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:04,620
You never know where they come from
when you buy them in markets.

413
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:07,460
Why not plant pepper
and cabbages and farm?

414
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:09,880
Why couldn't I think of that?

415
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:20,270
Let's go.

416
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:21,470
You're really using everything, right?

417
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,350
Of course. We need to finish them today.

418
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,690
So we can eat them next year.

419
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,530
-They're heavy, right?
-No, not at all.

420
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,490
-I'm serious.
-Jeez.

421
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:37,620
Of course, I'm the only one working.

422
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:39,370
Did you come to play?

423
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,540
It's so unfair.

424
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,290
-What is?
-Where should I put this?

425
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:58,090
That's good.

426
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:00,430
Here.

427
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:06,350
That's tasty.

428
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,360
Now, for you.

429
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,240
Wow.

430
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:16,740
-That's delicious.
-I know, right?

431
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:27,290
Here is a big one for you, boss.

432
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,340
Wow.

433
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,960
Sir.

434
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:35,170
Do you have makgeolli?

435
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:38,010
Hey, I'm Baek Dong-joo's dad.

436
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:41,510
It's so delicious.

437
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,260
Cheers.

438
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,530
Even though I was worried that you
would get sick after making this kimchi,

439
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:56,400
knowing that I'm being greedy,

440
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:59,030
I can't stop
because I want to eat this together.

441
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:01,070
We are honored.

442
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:05,290
And since we're healthy young men,
we don't have to worry about body aches.

443
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:06,790
We don't even get the flu.

444
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,710
I was discharged as an army sergeant.

445
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:09,960
-I see.
-I see.

446
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,000
I'm from the 370th of the military.

447
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:13,380
I'm from the marines.

448
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:15,380
Of course!

449
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,920
You've passed as my son-in-law.

450
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,300
Excuse me?

451
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:22,140
What are you saying?

452
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,600
You can't fool me.

453
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:27,270
You fool.

454
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:32,400
How'd you find out?

455
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,570
Who knows?

456
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,700
-Here. Eat up, boss.
-Thank you.

457
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:42,740
I'm looking forward
to more good information in the future.

458
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,790
I see.

459
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,790
Eat up first.

460
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:53,330
You can take your call here.

461
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:04,890
Hello?

462
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:07,350
My daughter has fainted.

463
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,270
So I need to go now.

464
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,890
Can you take my shift?

465
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,980
I see.

466
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:15,400
Please take over for me.

467
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,030
My wife is in dialysis right now.
So it's just me.

468
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:19,860
I see.

469
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,410
Jeez. My friend is hurt.

470
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:26,660
I should go. What do you think?

471
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,700
What? Who?

472
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,000
Well...

473
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:34,670
-Seok-ho.
-I see.

474
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,250
Do you have to go?

475
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,550
He has a wife and four daughters.

476
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,050
His wife is ill.

477
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,260
Don't wait up.
I don't think I'll be back tonight.

478
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,590
-Dad.
-Yes?

479
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,510
You're not going to Seok-ho, are you?

480
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:53,600
Well...

481
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:55,190
Girlfriend?

482
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,480
Stop talking nonsense.

483
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,860
-I'll drop you off.
-Let's go together.

484
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:01,950
Goodness. There's no need to.

485
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:05,820
Since you're here,
I hope you just enjoy the food.

486
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,280
Go ahead and eat.

487
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:08,450
Well...

488
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:10,830
Jeez. He's in such a hurry.

489
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,920
-Go ahead and eat. I'll be back.
-Okay.

490
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,300
It's really fine.
You were in the middle of eating.

491
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:25,260
It's totally fine.

492
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,600
Well...

493
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,560
I should've told you sooner.

494
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:37,150
I'm sorry.

495
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:39,070
Jeez. Don't be sorry at all.

496
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,150
Since Dong-joo was a kid,

497
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:46,700
I've imagined it a countless times.

498
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:49,410
About what?

499
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,700
I wondered what kind of a guy she'd meet.

500
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,500
Would I get jealous?

501
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:58,420
I would get furious
and wake up in the middle of the night.

502
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:04,010
I've imagined that tens
of thousands of times,

503
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:08,090
but seeing you and Dong-joo together,

504
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:09,430
I like it.

505
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:13,350
I feel very relieved.

506
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:18,020
She's never showed her true feelings.

507
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,230
She's used to pretend she's okay,

508
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:22,650
even if she wasn't.

509
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:26,860
So I always had that in my mind.

510
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:32,120
A roof is not enough for me
to shelter her from the rain.

511
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:35,370
I can't be that cozy blanket
to keep her warm.

512
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:40,040
I want her to receive greater
love outside of my arms,

513
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,170
instead of being loved in my arms.

514
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:46,720
That being said,

515
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:50,180
I'm saying this to definitely burden you.

516
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:54,310
Please make Dong-joo laugh a lot,

517
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:56,350
and give her a lot of love.

518
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:58,480
That's all I ask.

519
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,020
I will keep that in mind.

520
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,520
Thank you.

521
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:07,450
Thank you today,
and thank you in the future too.

522
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,570
Oh, drop me off
right after that intersection.

523
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:12,370
Yes, sir.

524
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:17,120
Well...

525
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:20,420
Are you going to keep
working at the apartment

526
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,500
a secret?

527
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,750
Well, that...

528
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:27,670
I get greedy while doing it,

529
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,590
so I can't quit easily.

530
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,430
If Dongju knew about it,
I think she'd tell me to quit right away.

531
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:38,140
I made you feel awkward putting
you in the middle, right? I'm sorry.

532
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,980
No, not at all.

533
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:53,490
Jeez. You must be exhausted.

534
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,700
-Sir.
-Yes?

535
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:57,910
Just a minute.

536
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,500
Yes?

537
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:07,050
Well, here.

538
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,340
Goodness. You didn't have to.

539
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:12,890
Jeez. Thank you.

540
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,470
Thank you so much.

541
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:17,010
Thank you.

542
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,810
Hey, Mr. Baek. Hurry!

543
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,520
-I'm in a hurry.
-Go ahead.

544
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:22,100
-Hurry.
-Okay.

545
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:23,440
Hurry and go.

546
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,820
Jeez. It's cold. Hurry and go.

547
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,800
Oh.

548
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:56,140
Sir.

549
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:58,430
-Have some.
-No, it's fine.

550
00:50:58,510 --> 00:50:59,680
Have some.

551
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:01,850
Thank you.

552
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:05,230
-Thank you. Go in safely.
-Okay.

553
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:07,400
Jeez.

554
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:23,620
How come our baby always
wants to eat only roasted sweet potatoes?

555
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:25,210
I know, right?

556
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:27,590
Here. Have some.

557
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,920
She shouldn't
look like sweet potatoes, though.

558
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:48,400
MY SWEET DAUGHTER

559
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:49,940
Dad.

560
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,440
Is everything okay?

561
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,780
-What?
-Seok-ho.

562
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,070
Yes, of course. He's okay.

563
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:00,660
-What the...?
-Are you done eating already?

564
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:03,370
I got home a while ago.

565
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,080
Let's not make kimchi next year.

566
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:07,330
We need to again.

567
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:08,920
Jeez. You never listen.

568
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,970
The oysters are in the fridge,
and I left the bossam on the table.

569
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:16,590
Don't forget it.

570
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,930
Okay.

571
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:19,760
Okay.

572
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:34,280
A DIME A JOB

573
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,280
Goodness.

574
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:39,910
Hey, I bet all the kimchi
in this town tastes the same.

575
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,330
I know, right?

576
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:44,080
I think we made 1000 bundles
of kimchi these past few days.

577
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,160
Goodness. We were
basically a kimchi factory.

578
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:49,460
We didn't even have a day of rest.

579
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:50,540
Boss.

580
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,210
Seriously,

581
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,210
why don't we go on vacation
during the kimchi-making season?

582
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:07,480
Jeez. Hey.

583
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,560
Look. There's no way we can rest.

584
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:13,650
I know this was my idea

585
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:17,780
to give our customers love,
peace, and happiness.

586
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,870
It's too good to just stay like this.

587
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:26,040
Shouldn't more people enjoy our service?

588
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,290
How?

589
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:29,370
Expanding business.

590
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,630
So how do we do that?

591
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:32,590
-We need to get investments.
-From who?

592
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:34,420
Let's go

593
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,470
more global with a sense of ownership.

594
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,470
Does that half mean "help?"

595
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,350
-Then, what is that?
-That means half, like half of something.

596
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,440
This is help, you fool.

597
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:55,190
What did you study in Noryangjin?

598
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:56,360
It changed?

599
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,090
Can I see you for a second?

600
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:38,400
I wondered if the day would come
when we could see each other comfortably.

601
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,490
That's today.

602
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,450
I'm going to America.

603
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:49,620
So I can study more.

604
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,130
That's good for you.

605
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,460
You've always wanted to study abroad.

606
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,640
Here.

607
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:08,930
It's not a gift.

608
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:10,310
It belongs to you.

609
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:33,330
I found it while I was packing my things.

610
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,470
Aren't you thinking about coming back?

611
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:20,340
Yes.

612
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,670
I got on the wrong bus, so I'm waiting.

613
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:25,630
When will you be here?

614
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,970
Jeez. I'll be there quickly.

615
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,930
How'd you get on the wrong bus?

616
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,100
Why weren't you paying attention?

617
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:32,810
-Dad.
-Dad?

618
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,180
What do you mean "dad?"

619
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,690
-Hey, hold on. Hang up.
-Hey.

620
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,360
Dad!

621
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,650
Dad!

622
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:48,070
-I can't that day. I got an order.
-Dad!

623
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:51,080
I'm available the next day.

624
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,280
Yes, of course.

625
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:55,290
Why can't he hear me?

626
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,060
Jeez. Just leave it.

627
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:24,980
No, that's fine. I can do it.

628
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:27,440
No, I'll get it.

629
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:28,530
Thank you, sir.

630
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:29,740
When's your baby due?

631
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:31,370
It's one week late.

632
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:32,660
Goodness.

633
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:37,000
They say that if you exercise and move
your body, the baby will come out faster.

634
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:39,290
-So I'm moving a lot.
-I see.

635
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:42,460
-Fighting!
-Fighting!

636
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:44,630
-Thank you.
-Sure.

637
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:46,510
-Go in safely.
-Okay.

638
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,720
Goodness. Careful.

639
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:54,510
Sir, should I put a label on this?

640
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,850
Are you throwing it out?

641
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:58,430
-Yes.
-It still looks good, though.

642
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:01,100
Could I have it?

643
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,270
But it's been used a lot.

644
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,820
Jeez. This looks new to me.

645
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,820
-You can leave it. I'll do it.
-Sure.

646
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,700
-Thank you.
-Sure.

647
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:43,060
Dong-joo.

648
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,400
Dong-joo.

649
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:46,400
Dong-joo.

650
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:47,940
Dong-joo. Hey.

651
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:53,490
Well...

652
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,830
I was going to tell you.

653
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:03,830
I'm sorry.

654
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:29,780
Father, did you know about this?

655
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:31,360
No.

656
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,740
I really didn't know.

657
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:39,580
I'm not trying to blame you, Father.

658
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,540
I just feel so stupid.

659
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,120
I'm just upset.

660
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,550
He thinks I'm studying.

661
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:54,550
I had no idea he's been working
that small guard post to support me.

662
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:56,890
Stella.

663
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:58,600
I want to end this.

664
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:01,680
I want to stop lying to my dad.

665
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:06,440
I want to go back home to live with him.

666
01:00:10,270 --> 01:00:11,320
You should.

667
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,130
-Dal-shik.
-Yes.

668
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:43,890
I'm glad to see you so energetic.

669
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,940
I wonder why daughters worry so much.

670
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:51,650
She probably thinks
I'm doing this because of her.

671
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:53,360
I'm still young

672
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:54,780
and healthy.

673
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:55,860
Exactly.

674
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,070
Fifty isn't considered old anymore.

675
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,780
You still have a long way
to go to grow up.

676
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:04,240
Look at you being butt-hurt.

677
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:05,750
You're butt-hurt, aren't you?

678
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,120
Still,

679
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:09,830
don't overwork yourself.

680
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,000
You're still running the factory.

681
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:14,090
Jeez. The factory isn't a concern.

682
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:17,630
What are you going to do
with all that money?

683
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:27,270
Dongju, have you thought about
the altar design?

684
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,640
Right.

685
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:33,440
-Here.
-Okay.

686
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,610
Wow. Your idea is amazing.

687
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:45,240
Complaints came in
because of the ATM machine

688
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:47,370
and the location of the donation envelope.

689
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,620
So let's think about
where to change the location.

690
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:51,710
Yes, sir.

691
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:55,750
Also, you've accumulated
a lot of days off.

692
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:58,760
Use them before the end
of this year, or they go to waste.

693
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,140
-Sir.
-Yes?

694
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:11,560
I have something to tell you.

695
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:14,570
Sure.

696
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:16,730
Well...

697
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:23,370
I think I should quit.

698
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,120
I'm going to study.

699
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:36,090
Sure.

700
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:39,170
How long can you work until?

701
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:47,810
Thank you.

702
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:02,150
I'm going to do what my dad wants.

703
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:05,780
I registered for the course

704
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:08,580
and told our team leader.

705
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:13,120
He asked me to stay
until he hired someone new,

706
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:15,080
so I said yes.

707
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:19,840
There's only one person left,

708
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:22,300
so I'm just going to finish it

709
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:24,430
and then quit.

710
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:34,560
Also,

711
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,530
I'm planning on moving back home.

712
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,280
Well...

713
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:49,910
You can't.

714
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:52,700
This is what I want to say,

715
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:59,710
but I think it's better for you
to be by your father's side.

716
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:06,260
I'll just visit you more often.

717
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,480
Jeez. The wind is strong.

718
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,740
You must be coming back from the market.

719
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,620
-Yes.
-I hope to hear some good news today.

720
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:30,780
-I wish so too.
-Jeez.

721
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:32,330
-Fighting!
-Fighting!

722
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:36,460
Jeez.

723
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:00,230
Move!

724
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:35,850
A DIME A JOB

725
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:55,040
I wish you'd stop.

726
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,450
Stop worrying about me,
and take care of yourself.

727
01:05:57,540 --> 01:05:59,290
 You're all grown up now, Dong-joo.

728
01:05:59,370 --> 01:06:00,460
I got a reply.

729
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,830
I want to discuss
investing in your company.

730
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,710
Let's go to Pan-gyo!

731
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:08,050
I have an errand request for you too.

732
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,470
Dong-joo, you have to be happy.

733
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,430
Please take care of Dong-joo.

734
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:14,510
What should I do tomorrow?

735
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:18,020
I will do it. I must do it myself.
