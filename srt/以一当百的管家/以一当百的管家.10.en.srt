1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,961
You're home late.

2
00:00:58,851 --> 00:00:59,852
Don't go.

3
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:20,206
I like you.

00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:37,515
TAE-HEE
OUTGOING CALL

5
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:43,771
Tae-hee<i>.</i>

6
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:47,024
I like you.

7
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,623
Afraid I might pressure you,

8
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:05,835
I kept hiding my feelings

9
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:08,963
but it's getting too hard now.

10
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,923
You're always on my mind.

11
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,595
I don't know why I'm like this myself,

12
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:21,517
but just seeing that car on the road,

13
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:23,811
my heart would skip a beat.

14
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,773
And entering this street,

15
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:29,942
I'd think, "Are the lights on?"

16
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:32,987
"Will I bump into him today?"

17
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,617
Then on days I do,

18
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,453
my heart would flutter

19
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:43,289
and I liked it.

20
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:54,884
So please.

21
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,177
Don't go to her.

22
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:01,932
I really

23
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:05,352
like you a lot, Tae-hee<i>.</i>

24
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:43,599
Not me.

25
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,394
I never felt that way about you.

26
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:54,610
This makes me uncomfortable.
Please don't do it again, Dong-joo<i>.</i>

27
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:00,532
Really?

28
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,164
Do you really

29
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,291
feel that way?

30
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:46,286
{\an8}EPISODE 10
I CAN SEE YOUR LIES

31
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:09,643
{\an8}COMMERCIAL PROPERTY FOR RENT

32
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:20,612
How is it?

33
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:25,117
It looks decent enough for a clinic.

34
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:31,915
Good enough for giving out diet products
and doing some cosmetic procedures.

35
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,005
It's for you.

36
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,052
Chung-ha is at my place right now.

37
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,345
Please take her back.

38
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,102
She doesn't listen to you,
why would she listen to me?

39
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,187
Please.

40
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:57,316
-I only came here to say this.
-Tae-hee.

41
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:02,529
I raised my Chung-ha like royalty.

42
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:06,241
She grew up getting
everything she ever wanted.

43
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,871
She

44
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:15,584
cannot let anything go
unless she does it first. She won't.

45
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:20,964
That's right. Seeing her like this,
I see that she's a spitting image of me.

46
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:23,550
But she's oblivious.

47
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,679
So sick and tired of her own mother.

48
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:35,270
It's not like I'm so fond of you
that I fully understand your sorrows,

49
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:39,399
and offering you this clinic not knowing
about your pathetic situation right now.

50
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,573
It's over between us.

51
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:49,952
I also don't intend
to be a doctor ever again.

52
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,704
I wouldn't have come if I knew about this.

53
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,373
And as you say, Mother, I...

54
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:02,256
I will live my pathetic life doing
as I'm told, with no thoughts or emotions.

55
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,885
So please, never contact me
for something like this again.

56
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:15,269
Prick!

57
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,728
Is your brother's death

58
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,690
my Chung-ha's fault?

59
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:25,404
You got yourself a woman, didn't you?
That's why you're being so ridiculous.

60
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:36,707
Yes.

61
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,918
I like someone else.

62
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,923
So I would appreciate it
if you would take Chung-ha back.

63
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:54,808
Son of a bitch!

64
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,400
MOM

65
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,661
{\an8}<i>I met Kim Tae-hee, you foolish girl.</i>

66
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,921
-Why would you meet Tae-hee, Mom?
-<i>He said...</i>

67
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:25,964
<i>he doesn't want your sorry face.</i>

68
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:28,133
<i>To please take you with me.</i>

69
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:32,095
Idiotic girl, snap out of it already!
What's so good about him?

70
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:35,224
<i>What did you tell him?</i>

71
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:39,144
He wouldn't even take a clinic.

72
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:40,771
<i>He said he's done with you.</i>

73
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,732
<i>-Nothing works for him.</i>
-You offered him a clinic?!

74
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:44,816
-Are you crazy?
<i>-Hey.</i>

75
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,653
Do you only understand words
you want to understand?

76
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,655
He's <i>done </i>with you!

77
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,076
He said he likes someone else.

78
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,581
Stop lying.

79
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,876
-Tae-hee doesn't have another woman.
-<i>Fine.</i>

80
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,879
If you don't believe me,
just ask him yourself, okay?

81
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:07,714
Goodness. Do you have no pride?

82
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:09,383
<i>Look how foolish you are!</i>

83
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:10,926
<i>You</i>

84
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,304
<i>will get your crap together</i>
<i>and come back home.</i>

85
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,181
<i>What is so lacking that...</i>

86
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:19,935
<i>-...you'd cling to a man that's over you?</i>
-Stop it! Do you want to see me die?

87
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,895
Will it end only if I die?

88
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,417
Calling us over for soju?
What's the occasion?

89
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,210
-Something happen?
-Nothing.

90
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:48,880
I just felt like soju today.

91
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:50,632
You too?

92
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,011
-Me too.
-What's going on with you?

93
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,683
-What's wrong with both of you today?
-Team Leader Seo...

94
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:02,769
...leaves my texts read but unanswered

95
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:04,896
and ignores my calls.

96
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:08,942
That's why
I told you not to woo him so much.

97
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:10,360
Do you have no pride?

98
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,280
Baek Dong-joo!
Does he not talk about me at all?

99
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,366
-Would he?
-I'm just so frustrated.

100
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:23,790
-Was I too forward? Did I pressure him?
-Mm-hmm. You went too fast.

101
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:29,046
I remember this one time, when I came home
bawling after getting dumped,

102
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,549
my grandma told me this.

103
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:34,926
What did she say?

104
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,804
A person I like

105
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,682
liking me back

106
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,061
is a miracle.

107
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,272
It actually rarely happens.

108
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,275
Grandma was right.

109
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,654
So you should snap out of it now.

110
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,030
Not me.

111
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:25,704
This makes me uncomfortable.
Please don't do it again, Dong-joo<i>.</i>

112
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,811
I like you.

113
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:01,740
<i>Do you really</i>

114
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,783
feel that way?

115
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,004
Asshole.

116
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,751
What the--

117
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,169
D--

118
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,380
D-Dong-joo, what's--

119
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:44,968
What's going on here?

120
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,056
What's wrong--
Ah, yes. Please just pass by.

121
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,559
There is a story behind this.

122
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,109
Dong-joo<i>.</i>

123
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,404
Man...

124
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,700
Is something wrong? Hmm?

125
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:11,369
Dong-joo<i>.</i>

126
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,040
Dong-joo, watch where you're going.

127
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:18,918
Jeez, why are you staggering like that?
You're making me nervous.

128
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:20,295
Pull yourself together.

129
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,547
We're almost home-- Whoa whoa whoa.

130
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,634
Oh, my heart. Are you okay?

131
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:26,760
Ah, I'm okay.

132
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,305
What made you drink so much, huh?

133
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:32,515
What, did someone bully you?

134
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:36,353
Just say the word, this Seo Hae-an
will go and do something about it.

135
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:39,230
Be careful. Look ahead.

136
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,567
It's a left turn here. Left turn.

137
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,444
Hey, kiddo.

138
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,946
Did you sleep well?

139
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,322
What you up to?

140
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,116
<i>Oh, I'm just about to go out.</i>

141
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,992
Why do you sound so tired?

142
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,870
Are you eating well? And healthy?

143
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,124
Of course I eat well.

144
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,836
Dad, I have to go now.
I'll call you again later.

145
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,463
Ah, okay. Be careful out there.

146
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,881
<i>Okay.</i>

147
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,765
BONGSU STREET

148
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,533
Heading to work now?

149
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:16,703
Yes.

150
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,504
I hope...

151
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:34,345
I hope you don't feel awkward with me
because of yesterday.

152
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,433
And I'm sorry.

153
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,604
Rejecting someone is also difficult.

154
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,614
-Hi, Dong-joo!
-Hello.

155
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,657
-Going to work?
-Yes.

156
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:58,453
-Then I'll be going now.
-Wait, take the car.

157
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,706
Hey, give her a ride on the way
to the green mother job.

158
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,249
Oh, no, it's fine.

159
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,709
-Hmm? Why?
-Have a good day.

160
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:06,795
Wait, wait, get a ride from...

161
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,590
What's with her?

162
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,346
Hey.

163
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:19,557
Why's it so awkward between you two?
Something happen?

164
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,726
No.

165
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:24,312
What are these?

166
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,105
Huh? Hangover meds?

167
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:29,359
-Did you get drunk last night?
-It's not like that.

168
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:35,281
Hey, what happened to Chung-ha,
by the way? Her stuff is gone.

169
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:39,244
She left.

170
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,705
Hmm. I see.

171
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,627
About your work today.

172
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,045
Should I go instead?

173
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,840
Why would you do that?

174
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:55,802
Well, it's just... I just feel restless.

175
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:58,805
I'm okay.

176
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:03,351
It's better to be working. Too busy
to think, and time goes faster too.

177
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:08,857
Too busy to think, you say.
You always have to be thinking.

178
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,359
You're thinking about not thinking.

179
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,529
What do you not want to think about?

180
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:17,615
Dong-joo?

181
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,956
You can have them. Have them all you want!
Why shouldn't you?

182
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,333
What are you even saying?

183
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:31,504
How dare you try to lie. Did you forget
I'm the Nokdu Street hermit?

184
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:35,133
This kind of behavior is unfit for
the second in command at A Dime A Job.

185
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:37,719
I'm gonna demote you
back to Butler Kim, all right?

186
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:41,097
-I'm off to work.
-Hey, the owner is speaking right now--

187
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,683
Hey. He's not even answering. Hey!

188
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:47,729
Fine, go. Go work yourself to death!

189
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,278
Where's the beer?

190
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,822
You look like you had enough to drink.

191
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,034
Looks like... soju?

192
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,621
So.

193
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:08,625
What is the worldly thing
that is troubling you this time, Sister?

194
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,627
-I got dumped.
-Dumped?!

195
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,629
By Brother Tae-hee?

196
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,799
What the... For real?

197
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,635
Oh, Lord... My apologies.

198
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,846
-Please continue, Sister.
-I thought...

199
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:26,267
...I would be cool even if
he didn't accept my confession.

200
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,728
I just did it
so I wouldn't regret it later.

201
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:33,358
Whether I got rejected or not,
it wouldn't matter 'cause I told him.

202
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,693
But now that I got rejected,

203
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:38,237
that really isn't the case.

204
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,949
And weirdly enough,
after saying it out loud,

205
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,035
I like him even more.

206
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,289
This is weird for me too.

207
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,333
I can't be cool about it.

208
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,211
What do you think?

209
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:57,799
Why must you be cool about this?
If it's hot, you can just leave it hot.

210
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,259
Human afflictions

211
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:04,055
are the strongest
when they go against their instincts.

212
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:06,808
Do not try too hard to change your heart.

213
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:07,892
Just...

214
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,561
Just leave it be.

215
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:14,899
How dare he...

216
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,277
Brother Tae-hee...

217
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:20,154
Your face is puffy

218
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,657
but you look skinnier.

219
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:26,244
Really? I don't think so.
My weight didn't change.

220
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,621
A pretty girl like you.

221
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,999
You don't lack anything either.

222
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:34,752
Brother Tae-hee has no eye for a girl.
What a shame.

223
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,881
Please head inside. I have to go to work.

224
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:42,927
All right. Don't you dare starve yourself
for a broken heart.

225
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,929
Don't be ridiculous.

226
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,557
-Dong-joo.
-Yes?

227
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,683
Your charm is?

228
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:50,309
Fat cheeks.

229
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:51,561
Correct!

230
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:54,522
-Bye.
-See you.

231
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:56,983
Father.

232
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,737
-Hello.
-Oh, Sister Agnes. What brings you here?

233
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:04,240
I'm here to give you a wedding invitation.
Here it is.

234
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:08,077
Oh wow! Congratulations.
I will make sure to be there.

235
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,204
Glad to hear that. Thank you.

236
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,792
Is it possible
to have a confession right now?

237
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:16,377
Right now?

238
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,181
A Dime A Job!

239
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,851
Remember me?

240
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,645
You know, from before. Hmm?

241
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:36,022
<i>"What you do with your hands</i>

242
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,649
horrifies me to hold them."

243
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,654
...was the message that Yoo Byeong-su
asked us to deliver.

244
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:44,906
Oh...

245
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,200
So you remember me, right?

246
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:50,703
Wow, you really do your job well.

247
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,914
I don't know what you told her,

248
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:56,834
but she didn't do any of the tiring stuff,
like clinging or crying to me.

249
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,295
Maybe that's why

250
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,340
she pops in my mind
once in a while at night.

251
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:05,551
You really never know humans' hearts.

252
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:08,846
She did have a cute face, you know?

253
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,057
You wouldn't remember, of course.

254
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,811
Thing is, I'm feeling a bit lonely lately.

255
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:18,731
Do you by chance go on
group dates and act goofy too?

256
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:20,399
Like, support someone else.

257
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:25,321
You know, someone looking great
but then saying weird things and--

258
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:31,160
Anyways, I'll contact you. Bye!

259
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,711
EONJU UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
FUNERAL HOME

260
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:43,172
The result of the annual
customer satisfaction survey

261
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:46,884
of the top 10 Seoul hospital funeral homes
are back, and we received

262
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:50,263
staff service, first place.
Price satisfaction, first place.

263
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,849
Amenities and accessibility,
both first place,

264
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:56,894
resulting in first place
for overall satisfaction.

265
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:04,110
However, the food received a 91%,

266
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:09,407
getting second place
after Daesan Hospital Funeral Home's 93%.

267
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:16,956
It has been our pride for 43 years,
how could we, to Daesan of all places?

268
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,585
That's why they are
demanding a report on this right now.

269
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:23,129
Should we go to Daesan
for a reconnaissance?

270
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:27,383
They have Director Han,
who worked here for 20 years.

271
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:31,179
Wouldn't he recognize us
from the back of our heads right away?

272
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:32,763
We would get busted.

273
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:34,432
That's true.

274
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:39,604
Then how about we send Baek Dong-joo?

275
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,690
Huh? Me?

276
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:46,027
Yeah. Baek Dong-joo
started a few months ago,

277
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,904
so Daesan wouldn't know her.

278
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:49,280
It's perfect!

279
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:56,495
Dong-joo. Do us a favor, please.

280
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:02,627
-You go, Uncle.
-They asked for you personally.

281
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:05,546
Punk, I'm the owner!

282
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,715
This mere employee...

283
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:10,843
Just this once, please?
I'll do everything next time.

284
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,054
Jeez. Put some effort into your excuses.

285
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:16,140
Just put up a neon sign
that says, "I'm avoiding you."

286
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:25,233
There won't be a next time.
Just this once. Okay?

287
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:27,026
Don't you dare go back on it.

288
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,320
Yeah.

289
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:38,412
I had no idea
my team leader had contacted you.

290
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:43,209
I guess this team leader
is really close to Tae-hee.

291
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,545
He pointed out Tae-hee
and asked him to do this job.

292
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:50,299
He must have had a good impression
of our Tae-hee, thanks to you.

293
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:51,676
Sorry?

294
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:57,848
Hmm? Oh, it's nothing.
What am I even saying.

295
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,771
You look super tired today, by the way.

296
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:07,775
-You can take a nap on the way.
-Oh, no, no. It's fine. I, uh...

297
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:10,027
...drank too much last night.

298
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:11,696
Alcohol? I see.

299
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:16,242
Let's get going.

300
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:18,786
What's this?

301
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:23,499
HANGOVER RELIEF

302
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:32,633
-Did something happen? Why'd you drink?
-Nothing happened.

303
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,552
Oh, open that right there.

304
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:41,309
What is it?

305
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:42,935
Take one. Bought 'em today.

306
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:44,437
Did you drink?

307
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:48,316
No. They are for emergency use.
Have one, Dong-joo.

308
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,693
I see. Thank you.

309
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:59,702
DAESAN FUNERAL HOME

310
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:02,580
For whom have you come for?

311
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:06,042
Greetings. My name is Vincent.

312
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:12,631
I am in search of a place
for the finale of my life,

313
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:17,928
as us humans are all on
a journey called death.

314
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:24,101
Funeral directors like yourself
work so closely with this death.

315
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:27,229
I, from the deepest part of my heart,

316
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,106
greatly respect you.

317
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:31,275
Oh, I see...

318
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:35,488
A funeral is the celebration of reaching
the final destination of the journey.

319
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:39,658
What we need at a celebration
are a good location, good people,

320
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:40,868
and

321
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:41,952
good

322
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:43,037
food.

323
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,332
Which is why I want to ask...

324
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:51,003
Could I taste the yukgaejang
that will be served at my funeral?

325
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:55,216
I'm not supposed to,

326
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:58,761
but there were some leftovers
at one of the completed funerals.

327
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:02,848
This was probably too much to ask.
Thank you very much.

328
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:07,061
I have to attend to a room for a moment.
Let me know when you are finished.

329
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:09,021
-Yes.
-Thank you.

330
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:10,815
Of course.

331
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,321
Good.

332
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:26,038
Wow. This is the real deal.

333
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:28,666
-Real deal? Wow.
-It's throat-scratchy spicy.

334
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:30,042
And thick and heavy.

335
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,044
-What's the secret?
-Secret?

336
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:34,130
-The meat.
-Meat?

337
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,674
It's brisket, but not tough.

338
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:40,052
It's hand-pulled for the softness.
What's more...

339
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:41,929
-...this is hanu.
-How do you know?

340
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:45,224
Yukgaejang is seasoned heavily
so you don't need high quality meat.

341
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:48,018
-The broth has marrow bone, brisket--
-Shank?

342
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:49,353
-That's right.
-That's right.

343
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:52,106
Probably boiled for 14 hours straight.

344
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:54,817
Fiddleheads probably
seasoned with salt by itself.

345
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,488
Oyster mushrooms and sprouts were cooked,
separated, cooled quickly, then added.

346
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:00,948
How do you know all this?

347
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:03,617
I was a sysop
for the FreeChal Epicurism club.

348
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:05,953
-What is that?
-Biggest power of the time.

349
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:09,540
I have Computer Knowledge rank 1,
ITQ and MOS.

350
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:12,710
If you need to write a report,
please hire me.

351
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:16,338
Wow, that's crazy.

352
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,717
I will also give you a Baek Dong-joo
free pass. Use it whenever.

353
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,178
I would love that. Nice!

354
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,638
Here. Have some too, Dong-joo.

355
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,686
<i>Where you at? I'm at your workplace.</i>

356
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:31,937
Excuse me.

357
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,441
What "nefarious intentions"?

358
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,485
I'm an NA. A nursing assistant.

359
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:40,321
Do I need your permission
to find a new hospital?

360
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:45,159
-And report to you my job interviews?
-You barely moved to the one you're at.

361
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,995
You're moving jobs for <i>those </i>reasons?

362
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:53,125
Do you think I'm crazy for a man?
I can't say it's not at all like that,

363
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:55,211
but it's good if I get it. You know?

364
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,463
I get to see you more often.

365
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:00,966
And I get to see our team leader
more often in a natural way.

366
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,051
<i>Hey.</i>

367
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,720
Don't you dare get close
to our funeral home.

368
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,847
You're causing my team leader--

369
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,934
<i>You're good if I'm good, aren't you?</i>

370
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:12,311
<i>Huh? Hello?</i>

371
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:14,188
<i>Hey!</i>

372
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:22,404
<i>-</i>Excuse me.
-Hello, this is A Dime A Job.

373
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,157
Yes, uh.

374
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:31,247
-Hello.
-How have you been?

375
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:35,000
Ah man, I was worried on the way,
thinking what if Kim isn't here.

376
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:38,045
-I would have come by if you just called.
-No way!

377
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:41,173
Not for someone as busy as you,
working and studying.

378
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:44,802
How may I help you?

379
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:49,139
Oh. I had a favor to ask of you.

380
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:51,433
On your way home,

381
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,144
can you deliver these to Dong-joo?

382
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,146
Oh...

383
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:03,153
I want to go and check out how she lives
and put those in her fridge myself,

384
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:05,614
but she makes a fuss when I tell her that.

385
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:09,326
Since you live in the same building,

386
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,704
please do me that favor.

387
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,249
Of course. I'll deliver them to her.

388
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:18,919
Oh, and these are
kimchi and some sides I made.

389
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:22,673
They'll taste great for you.
I copied Baek Jong-won completely.

390
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,551
-Oh no, it's okay.
-Take them!

391
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:32,683
-You're looking after me all the time.
-Don't mention it.

392
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:33,892
Thank you very much.

393
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:36,520
Oh, and...

394
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:38,814
Studying is hard, right?

395
00:31:42,151 --> 00:31:43,402
-It's fine.
-No way.

396
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:46,530
I'm sure it's really hard.
How could it not be?

397
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,950
Dong-joo also seems
to struggle a lot lately.

398
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:55,456
I'm not sure but it looks like it.
I would take care of her if I was with her

399
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:57,499
but I can't right now.

400
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:02,963
So Tae-hee<i>, </i>since you're next to her,
please take care of her for me.

401
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:05,174
I know I'm shameless, but please.

402
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:07,718
Well, I'm off.

403
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:09,928
My break is almost over.

404
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:11,764
Let me give you a ride.

405
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:14,183
No, no, you're busy.

406
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:19,396
-Let's go.
-Hey, I said it's okay. Oh, man.

407
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,207
I thought I was busted earlier.

408
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:42,628
If I said the name of the hospital,
it would have been over. Thank goodness.

409
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:45,631
I thought something happened,
seeing your white face.

410
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:47,633
-Something did happen!
-What?

411
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,219
I didn't lie once today.

412
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:54,348
I really did plan to take a look
at my funeral location before I die.

413
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:59,311
Can't go without a rehearsal
to my last party.

414
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:04,233
-Thank you for today.
-Mm-hmm. Rest well, Dong-joo.

415
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,776
-You too.
-Okay.

416
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:12,449
Are you visiting A Dime A Job?

417
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:15,744
You could have asked through the app.

418
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:18,706
I received a business card
from a Bongsu Church priest.

419
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:20,791
Oh, Father Michael?

420
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,335
-Yes.
-I see.

421
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:26,046
I'm...

422
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:30,801
We grant you everything, so don't hesitate
to tell us, whatever it is.

423
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:35,639
I'm sorry. I really have no one else
around me, so I had no choice.

424
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:37,182
-By chance...
-Oh jeez!

425
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,601
Da-min<i>?</i>

426
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:42,312
Yes, but how...

427
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,191
Funeral Director?

428
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:51,864
-Thank you so much for that time.
-Please, it's fine.

429
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:55,325
Thanks to you, I sent my brother in peace.

430
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:59,788
But what might be of your concern today?

431
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,250
I'm getting married soon, and...

432
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,753
Wow! Congratulations!

433
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:08,505
This is great news!

434
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:11,884
But, I need a friend.

435
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,513
What a heart-wrenching story.

436
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:18,974
No parents, no friends.

437
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:22,060
-Would have been hard, being alone.
-I agree.

438
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:23,896
I blame weddings.

439
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:27,191
I will get married
at a quiet Buddhist temple.

440
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:30,277
Weren't you practicing non-maritalism?

441
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:33,489
In my next life.
I believe in reincarnation.

442
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:37,075
But you go to a Catholic church.

443
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:39,912
So, how's the Father doing?

444
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,749
-Oh, we'll meet him at the wedding.
-Mm-hmm.

445
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:45,793
Anyways, good work today.

446
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:48,378
-Thank you for the work.
-Yeah. Go ahead.

447
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,718
-Dong-joo.
-Yes?

448
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:58,889
Are you sure? About the wedding.

449
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:02,935
I'll be going with you anyways.

450
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:05,062
I'm just grateful is all.

451
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:07,648
-Go on ahead.
-Good night.

452
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,052
Who is it?

453
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:45,185
Sorry, it's late.

454
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:49,106
Here.

455
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:52,234
What are these?

456
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,279
Your father was here earlier.

457
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:57,114
He was here?

458
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:59,283
Yes, he asked me
to deliver these on my way home.

459
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,076
He came to the office.

460
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:04,746
Thank you.

461
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,164
Sure.

462
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:08,250
Then...

463
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:27,394
Yum! So delicious.

464
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:31,899
You just got home?

465
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:34,234
What's this kimchi? It's so good.

466
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:38,280
Earlier today, Dong-joo's father came by.

467
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:40,449
He brought some for us too.

468
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:44,870
I'm so grateful. He even gave us japchae.
That is a lot of work.

469
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:48,248
Guess I won't have to make dinner tonight.

470
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,334
Kid. Let's eat.

471
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:53,337
Nah, I'm good. Eat alone today, Uncle.

472
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:55,923
Hey, you have a job next Sunday.

473
00:36:56,924 --> 00:36:58,926
-Where?
-An acting wedding guest.

474
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:00,552
Okay.

475
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:02,554
You're going with Dong-joo.

476
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:09,978
-Huh?
-Hmm? What.

477
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:12,940
You

478
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:16,109
promised to do
anything you're told. Right?

479
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,615
Can I please not go?

480
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:25,661
This kid. Hey.

481
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:28,121
Why are you refusing to do anything today?

482
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:30,248
Is Dong-joo an A Dime A Job employee?

483
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:33,293
Why're you refusing to do a job
she's willing to help out with?

484
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:37,714
If you continue this behavior,
I'm going to fire you and hire Dong-joo.

485
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,467
Who's my employee, here?!

486
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,016
Kid!

487
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:50,769
Do you have anything to wear for it?

488
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:52,938
Should I buy you something?

489
00:37:57,567 --> 00:38:00,487
You didn't have to pack all these.

490
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:03,073
<i>You see the apple and melon pieces?</i>

491
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:05,867
<i>If you don't want to eat,</i>
<i>at least eat your fruits.</i>

492
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:07,661
Dad, you are something.

493
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:14,209
-What's with the toothpaste?
<i>-You have to buy them.</i>

494
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:19,381
I can afford kitchen gloves, you know.

495
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:22,092
You'll see you'll have
places to use them soon.

496
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:23,969
<i>I hate pink.</i>

497
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:26,388
They were cute!

498
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:30,017
Oh, right.
You see the laundry soap in there?

499
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:31,935
They're handmade.

500
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,021
Give some to Kim too.

501
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:35,814
Who uses laundry soap these days?

502
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:37,774
Dad.

503
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,986
You didn't hand out stuff
at A Dime A Job, did you?

504
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:45,657
-Can I not share my kimchi?
-Dad, why would you?

505
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:50,037
There's plenty of people
that don't eat other people's kimchi.

506
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,165
It's troublesome to throw it away.
It makes them uncomfortable.

507
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,750
<i>Why would you throw kimchi away?</i>

508
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,835
You would make a fuss about it.

509
00:38:57,711 --> 00:38:59,129
Kim isn't like that.

510
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,883
He's well put-together and polite.

511
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,177
He even gave me a ride home.

512
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:07,220
A ride?

513
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:09,723
-Home?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

514
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:13,310
Because I carried everything
all the way there,

515
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:19,316
I said no,
but he insisted on driving me home.

516
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:21,860
<i>It was nice, thanks to him.</i>

517
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:30,535
-Dong-joo.
<i>-Yeah.</i>

518
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:32,996
If you wanna come home,

519
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,540
you can, whenever you want.

520
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,794
If you want your dad's food,

521
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,171
come home whenever.

522
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:43,507
<i>Got it?</i>

523
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,551
Yeah.

524
00:39:57,646 --> 00:39:58,730
Ah, for real...

525
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:43,191
Whoa, Dong-joo<i>.</i>

526
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,781
Going to exercise?

527
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:51,700
Yes.

528
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:59,583
So, I'm also about to get some air
through these nostrils. Can I join you?

529
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:02,043
Sure.

530
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:08,675
When I was in sixth grade,
we had a school trip to Seoul.

531
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,304
Oh man, it was a shock.

532
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:15,473
A fort of a subway station,

533
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,768
24-hour cafés,
Han river and Nam mountain, man.

534
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:22,522
It was so shiny,
I fell in love at first sight.

535
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:25,150
So I

536
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:27,402
told my friends,

537
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:32,282
"I'm going to live in Seoul when I'm 20."

538
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:35,452
One of them told me,

539
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,079
"Stop being ridiculous."

540
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,041
But look.

541
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:42,834
This Seo Hae-an

542
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,295
at the A Dime A Job house

543
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:47,839
living next door to Dong-joo<i>.</i>

544
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:51,426
So how is Seoul? Is it all you dreamed of?

545
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,470
Yep. I like it.

546
00:41:57,557 --> 00:41:58,558
And

547
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:06,149
I like you too, Dong-joo<i>.</i>

548
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:13,573
I really like you a lot, Dong-joo<i>.</i>

549
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,203
You're like a cure-all for me, you know?

550
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:22,165
Even my headache goes away when I see you.

551
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:27,128
You're like my mom.

552
00:42:27,963 --> 00:42:28,964
I like that

553
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:31,383
you're like my mom.

554
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,058
If there is a chance,

555
00:42:40,976 --> 00:42:42,143
would you be willing

556
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,020
to accept my feelings?

557
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:52,612
Man, I wanted to tell you this
at a nicer place, cutting some steaks.

558
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:55,490
Sorry for doing this
in such a shabby place.

559
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,118
Don't be. There is no such thing.

560
00:43:02,831 --> 00:43:04,249
-Hae-an<i>.</i>
-Yes?

561
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:06,459
Thank you.

562
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:10,338
Being this honest with your feelings...

563
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:12,757
I know it's really difficult to do.

564
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:18,179
Thank you for liking me.

565
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:24,311
-Oh man. Then does that mean--
-But...

566
00:43:28,565 --> 00:43:30,275
there is someone I like.

567
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:35,780
I'm sorry, Hae-an<i>.</i>

568
00:43:40,577 --> 00:43:45,206
Oh man! It's fine.
W-what's there to be sorry about?

569
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,543
It's okay, really.

570
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:53,381
So there is someone you like. I see...

571
00:43:53,757 --> 00:43:56,551
Man, I envy that person. Yeah.

572
00:43:58,011 --> 00:43:59,512
It's okay.

573
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:01,931
It's fine. Yeah.

574
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,648
Sh-she, she likes someone else.

575
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:14,778
Aw man, it's all over.

576
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:18,490
Poor Dong-joo too, for going through this
so early in the morning.

577
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:21,868
Hey, move on now.

578
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:23,995
Besides,

579
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,664
my grandpa wouldn't
confess like that either.

580
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:31,294
You like her because she's like your mom--
I'm embarrassed for you.

581
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:34,923
I mean, is that an issue?

582
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:38,176
You didn't know
that women hate hearing that?

583
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:41,596
Put yourself in her shoes.
A girl confesses her love to you,

584
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,848
saying you're like her dad.
How would you feel?

585
00:44:44,224 --> 00:44:49,104
-Aw man, it's really all over.
-See? Now you understand.

586
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:54,359
B-but, wouldn't it be different to be mom?

587
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:58,238
What should I do with him?
Where do I have to start--

588
00:44:59,656 --> 00:45:00,657
Never mind.

589
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:02,951
What's the point?

590
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:06,496
Dong-joo apparently
gave her heart to someone else.

591
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:12,043
You a barista or something?

592
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,880
This idiot...

593
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:17,715
I understand.

594
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:21,177
This is shocking, even for you, right?

595
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:24,889
But, man...

596
00:45:26,975 --> 00:45:30,812
I wonder who the bastard is
that Dong-joo likes.

597
00:45:32,856 --> 00:45:35,442
Even if you knew,
what would you do about it?

598
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:39,112
Who cares about the police badge
and whatnot at this point.

599
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:42,073
I'm just going to kill him and sink him.

600
00:45:42,449 --> 00:45:44,075
Good sir, get ready.

601
00:45:46,995 --> 00:45:49,414
-Don't start thinking so extreme.
-It's fine.

602
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:51,666
I'm just gonna do it.

603
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:01,426
Man, on <i>Home of Legends,</i>

604
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:05,054
I saw people become bedridden
and eventually die from love sickness.

605
00:46:05,138 --> 00:46:06,598
I finally understand now.

606
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:09,225
My mouth is all rough

607
00:46:09,893 --> 00:46:11,102
and tastes bitter.

608
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:12,896
I might die soon.

609
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:16,399
You have to eat well
during times like these, okay?

610
00:46:16,483 --> 00:46:18,193
You always get headaches too.

611
00:46:19,152 --> 00:46:21,738
You know nothing. You don't know love!

612
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,785
Yes, this is Seo Hae-an.

613
00:46:29,746 --> 00:46:31,289
Yes, I am Officer Seo.

614
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:35,043
Oh man! From Bongsu Police Department?

615
00:46:37,754 --> 00:46:38,755
Wow, y-yes.

616
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,716
No, thank <i>you.</i>

617
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:43,551
Yes, yes.

618
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:47,096
Bless you, sir. I will be there soon.

619
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:52,101
-What?
-Oh man, my legs feel like jelly.

620
00:46:54,521 --> 00:46:58,191
I've been appointed
to the Bongsu Police Department.

621
00:46:59,901 --> 00:47:04,656
I'm a detective now. Detective! Oh man!

622
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:09,202
I heard they don't accept newbies,
so I worked hard for two years. Finally!

623
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:14,082
Mother, your son Seo Hae-an
is finally going places!

624
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:17,627
I'm going places, Mother.

625
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:21,589
You deserve it.

626
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:25,218

00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:38,022
-Who?
-Oh!

629
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,609
Hello. My name is Seo Hae-an.

630
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,736
Oh, our new investigator?

631
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:47,949
Aw, man, investigator...

632
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:50,285
Yes. Investigator is correct.

633
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:56,082
Wow, this is embarrassing.
Please just casually call me Hae-an.

634
00:47:57,667 --> 00:48:01,087
Why are you wiping down desks
your first day? It really doesn't matter.

635
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:06,217
Man. You have not seen
a shiny desk before then, huh.

636
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:11,222
I will be cleaning the area from now on,
so just watch.

637
00:48:11,306 --> 00:48:12,890
You'll soon notice things.

638
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:15,852
Hello.

639
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:18,771
You've come.
You can leave after transitioning him.

640
00:48:18,855 --> 00:48:20,607
Aw man, so,

641
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:23,484
is he my senior?

642
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:24,986
'Sup.

643
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:26,946
Aw man.

644
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:30,408
Your face shines. What a handsome man!

645
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,410
What does he want from me?

646
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:36,956
Have we met before?

647
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:41,252
Oh, I hear that all the time.

648
00:48:41,628 --> 00:48:45,089
Just look. A very common face.
The Republic of Korea's average!

649
00:48:45,173 --> 00:48:46,382
Oh, I see.

650
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,801
-Pull up a chair next to me.
-Yes, sir.

651
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,264
Let's see.

652
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:55,558
If you look here,

653
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:58,019

-Okay.

657
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:06,861
-Lead, I'll be leaving now.
-Good work.

658
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:08,613
Wait, hold on.

659
00:49:10,073 --> 00:49:11,074
That's it?

660
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:13,201
Yep. You can figure out
the rest as you go.

661
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,620
-Call if you have questions. See ya.
-Okay.

662
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,955
-Ah, well, goodbye.
-Bye.

663
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:22,085
Man...

664
00:49:23,795 --> 00:49:25,588
How is it so simple?

665
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:27,507
Catching a bug would be harder.

666
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:44,774
KIM SEONG-HAN CHEON DA-MIN

667
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:13,386
-Da-min!
-Oh, Su-yeong.

668
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:16,639
You look beautiful.

669
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,016
Thank you for coming.

670
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:20,435
Of course I'd be here.

671
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:24,856
Babe.

672
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:27,567
Oh, Su-yeong?

673
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:30,319
-Is that you?
-That's correct.

674
00:50:30,737 --> 00:50:33,906
-You study fashion at Parson's?
-Yes, nice to meet you.

675
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:36,492
I've wanted to meet you for so long!

676
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:39,746
-I've heard so much about you.
-Likewise.

677
00:50:41,456 --> 00:50:43,750
What do you think? You picked this for me.

678
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,085
Wow. It looks great on you.

679
00:50:46,169 --> 00:50:49,088
I never thought I would wear
a watch like this in my lifetime.

680
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:50,590
This is totally my style.

681
00:50:52,175 --> 00:50:54,677
You came all the way here for our wedding.

682
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:56,554
You landed this morning, right?

683
00:50:57,138 --> 00:50:59,390
-Yes.
-You must be jet-lagged.

684
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:01,934
Oh, by the way,

685
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:03,853
did you come alone?

686
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:07,023
Oh, that's...

687
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:09,400
I heard you were coming
with your boyfriend.

688
00:51:09,484 --> 00:51:11,486
Oh. Uh...

689
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:36,093
I was late. Sorry.

690
00:51:50,817 --> 00:51:52,026
Thanks to you, Father,

691
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,654
we get to see something like this.

692
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:56,614
All thanks to you, Brother.

693
00:51:59,534 --> 00:52:00,576
-Father.
-Yes.

694
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:03,830
-Do you have a meal ticket?
-Oh, I only have...

695
00:52:04,914 --> 00:52:06,541
-...one meal ticket.
-Ah.

696
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:10,253
-Me too.
-Oh my.

697
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:14,799
I've heard it's Western-style buffet.

698
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:17,969
Then shall we enjoy the buffet,

699
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:21,764
while having a very deep conversation
about our nephew and niece?

700
00:52:21,848 --> 00:52:24,058
That would be a meaningful time together.

701
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:25,726
-Let us go.
-Yes.

702
00:52:26,853 --> 00:52:29,897
So then, what are we to become?

703
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:34,527
Are we going to become
what they call the in-laws?

704
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:39,115
Let us not rush things too much.

705
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:46,747
Brother Vincent, seeing you now,
your name must mean "wise."

706
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:54,589
-Hello.
-We were just waiting for you.

707
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:57,925
I actually was more curious about you.

708
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:00,720
I'm Kim Seong-han.

709
00:53:01,137 --> 00:53:02,138
I'm Lee Jae-ha.

710
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,725
I've heard so much about you.
Great to finally meet you.

711
00:53:07,435 --> 00:53:08,436
By the way...

712
00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:12,231
you're much more

713
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:14,525
handsome than I imagined.

714
00:53:16,569 --> 00:53:19,906
Not as much as us,
but you two look great together.

715
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:22,366
Would've been nice to have met earlier.

716
00:53:22,742 --> 00:53:25,828
You two should also marry, you know?
I highly recommend it.

717
00:53:25,912 --> 00:53:28,080
It's really great.

718
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:40,134
-Hey, did you see the watch?
-Was that a wedding present?

719
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:44,388
-Is it more than 10,000,000 won?
-Way more. It's got diamonds all over it.

720
00:53:44,472 --> 00:53:46,515
You can't get
something like that in Korea.

721
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:48,976
-Isn't it fake?
-Jeez, you scared me.

722
00:53:49,352 --> 00:53:50,394
Fake, my ass.

723
00:53:50,478 --> 00:53:53,397
Not after him getting
the special civil police position.

724
00:53:53,648 --> 00:53:56,359
What a life. He passed
the rank 5 exam on the first try.

725
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:58,069
Now a pretty and rich wife.

726
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:00,071
This is called the virtuous cycle.

727
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:02,073
He was born rich, there's no other way.

728
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:03,908
We are struggling even for rank 9.

729
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:06,452
Hey. I'm pretty close this time.

730
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:08,663
-This guy always says this.
-Idiot. I am.

731
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:09,997
You are, huh?

732
00:54:16,671 --> 00:54:19,799
-Sorry I'm late.
-No, you were right on time.

733
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:33,145
I thought the owner was coming today.

734
00:54:34,355 --> 00:54:35,356
We'll talk later.

735
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,651
Should we head in?

736
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:42,613
Oh, go ahead.
I'll stay with the bride a little longer.

737
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:44,448
Okay.

738
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:55,292
Get out of my way.

739
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,420
What's wrong with him?

740
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:10,725
-Uncomfortable, right?
-It's fine.

741
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,310
-You should head inside.
-Nah.

742
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:16,063
You're so pretty.

743
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:30,536
-Hey. What are you doing?
-Huh?

744
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:34,874
-Does she know the bride?
-Who?

745
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:38,127
-Oh, Su-yeong?
-Su-yeong?

746
00:55:39,295 --> 00:55:40,713
Yeah, Da-min's best friend.

747
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:43,174
She studies in the US. Just flew in today.

748
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:50,264
Did you fall in love? You're too late.
She came with a super handsome boyfriend.

749
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:53,350
-Boyfriend, for real?
-Yeah, they're getting married.

750
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,021
-Seong-han.
-Yes.

751
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:01,400
See ya. Make sure
you eat the food here. It's amazing. Bye!

752
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:25,883
MAY HE REST IN PEACE

753
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:28,010
Brother...

754
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:34,350
Brother.

755
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:37,520
Do you have

756
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:41,023
any last words or wishes

757
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:43,275
you want to tell me?

758
00:56:51,951 --> 00:56:52,952
Not me, but...

759
00:56:55,830 --> 00:57:01,502
if by chance you meet my sister again,

760
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:06,465
please listen to her story.

761
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:09,385
That is my last wish.

762
00:57:12,138 --> 00:57:14,598
I hoped to see Da-min's wedding...

763
00:57:18,144 --> 00:57:19,395
but my feet won't budge.

764
00:57:21,272 --> 00:57:22,606
I need a friend

765
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:26,277
that will receive my bouquet.

766
00:57:27,987 --> 00:57:30,114
Oh, well in that case... Darn.

767
00:57:31,282 --> 00:57:34,952
-A Dime A Job doesn't have a female empl--
-I will go.

768
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:37,830
-You will, Dong-joo?
-Yes.

769
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,208
Thank you so much.

770
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:43,460
Thank you.

771
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:11,447
One, two, three!

772
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:51,028
4_TIME OUT

773
00:58:52,321 --> 00:58:53,948
{\an8}BONGSU MARKET KIM JOON-HO INCIDENT

774
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:01,956
Wow, on the first day?

775
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:06,585
-Let's go.
-Huh? Where?

776
00:59:06,669 --> 00:59:09,797
-Just come for now.
-Yes, sir.

777
00:59:15,678 --> 00:59:18,931
Lee Jae-ha<i>. </i>Lee Jae-ha!

778
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:31,360
I thought you were Butler Kim.
Why is your name Lee Jae-ha?

779
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:33,988
I heard you're from the US. Since when?

780
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:37,241
I thought I saw you
a few days ago at an intersection.

781
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:40,369
Oh, a doppleganger?
Or do you have a twin brother?

782
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:45,916
I wasn't going to come
if it wasn't for the food,

783
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:47,835
but man, this is good.

784
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:52,881
Seong-han's from
a wealthy family, so, you know

785
00:59:52,965 --> 00:59:57,636
the rumor was that he's getting married
to a woman of similar caliber.

786
00:59:57,845 --> 00:59:59,763
All my friends think that too.

787
01:00:00,723 --> 01:00:02,349
What a shocker.

788
01:00:04,018 --> 01:00:05,185
But this is a little

789
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:08,022
unprofessional, A Dime A Job.

790
01:00:09,481 --> 01:00:13,110
In college, I worked part-time
at a wedding hall for a while.

791
01:00:13,193 --> 01:00:17,364
So I know there are some regulars
that act as parents and officiators.

792
01:00:17,448 --> 01:00:21,827
I recognized the bride's parents.
They come here regularly, as a package.

793
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:23,287
You didn't know?

794
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:29,418
Man, if you work like this,
Seong-han will find out sooner or later.

795
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:32,838
I'm sorry. I apologize.

796
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:34,590
Sorry? Why be sorry to me?

797
01:00:35,924 --> 01:00:37,593
I heard they have a story.

798
01:00:37,676 --> 01:00:41,013
I'm very sorry. But if you could
let this go quietly just this once--

799
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:44,516
By the way,
are you and Baek Dong-joo really dating?

800
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:54,234
What, you two are dating, for real?

801
01:00:55,444 --> 01:00:57,821
You broke up with her for me,
then asked her out?

802
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:04,661
What, did you see each other that day
and felt a spark?

803
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:09,083
That girl though. Would she want
to date someone who broke up with her?

804
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:12,669
Look. Dong-joo is

805
01:01:12,753 --> 01:01:15,297
using you because
she can't move on from me.

806
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:21,053
Oh! That must be why
she didn't even contact me. That cutie.

807
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,353
Do you even know her occupation?

808
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:38,404
You know and you're still dating her?
You can hold her hands and stuff?

809
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:42,491
Admirable.

810
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:47,955
Now that I think about it,
she does have a pretty face.

811
01:01:48,914 --> 01:01:52,793
I was just creeped out by the fact
that she's a funeral director.

812
01:01:53,419 --> 01:01:54,461
Besides that, well,

813
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:56,964
she has a pretty face.

814
01:01:57,923 --> 01:02:01,593
I guess you two get along
because you both do some rough work.

815
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:07,808
Oh, come on. What if I go over there
and blabber everything?

816
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:09,309
I'm gonna go do it!

817
01:02:11,437 --> 01:02:12,646
Loosen up, bro.

818
01:02:13,021 --> 01:02:18,026
You want to ruin everything, don't you?
It's pretty easy to cancel a wedding.

819
01:02:21,864 --> 01:02:25,451
I'm trying really hard
to keep my mouth shut right now.

820
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:29,371
Because I had
a good impression of you last time.

821
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:34,376
That's why
I'm letting it slide this time, okay?

822
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:44,678
Hey, let's go eat.
What's taking you so long?

823
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:47,055
You brought this on yourself.

824
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:49,683
Hey, come in for a sec.

825
01:02:51,894 --> 01:02:53,770
What. I'm hungry.

826
01:02:54,605 --> 01:02:56,523
Remember the girl I dated before?

827
01:02:57,649 --> 01:03:01,111
You know, the undertaker that lied
about prepping for the civil exam.

828
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:04,198
Apparently now she's scamming people too.

829
01:03:05,574 --> 01:03:07,618
She teamed up with this son of a bitch.

830
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:09,912
-Huh?
-I mean...

831
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:13,123
Even if she's that desperate for money,

832
01:03:13,207 --> 01:03:15,375
she shouldn't have come to a wedding,

833
01:03:15,876 --> 01:03:18,212
spreading her undertaker
misfortune everywhere--

834
01:03:18,587 --> 01:03:20,172
Oh God, you okay?

835
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:25,093
Stop them. Quick!

836
01:03:28,931 --> 01:03:34,394
Hey, Kim Seong-han!
This is a marriage scam!

837
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:38,398
Let go. Let me go! You bastard.

838
01:03:40,776 --> 01:03:43,278
-Come at me.
-Stop it!

839
01:03:47,366 --> 01:03:51,328
Nice! Very nice.

840
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:54,540
-There's a fist fight outside.
-Who is it?

841
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:56,792
I don't know, the bride's guest?

842
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:58,168
It's crazy over there.

843
01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:01,922
-They're saying this is a marriage scam.
-What?

844
01:04:02,923 --> 01:04:04,883
Hey, let's go.

845
01:04:12,975 --> 01:04:14,101
-Hello.
-Hello.

846
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:18,897
We're Bongsu Traffic Investigations, here
for yesterday's traffic accident patient.

847
01:04:18,981 --> 01:04:20,190
Name please.

848
01:04:20,274 --> 01:04:24,861
Choi Gi-joon, 27, male.
We need to see his status.

849
01:04:24,945 --> 01:04:26,863
-Let me check.
-Okay.

850
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:35,539
-What time did he get here last night?
-It was 9:50 p.m.

851
01:04:39,418 --> 01:04:40,502
His status?

852
01:04:46,258 --> 01:04:48,135
BONGSU CATHEDRAL PRIEST
SISTER AGNES' HAPPINESS

853
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:49,761
What is wrong with you?

854
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,723
I feel so humiliated!

855
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:07,029
I apologize. I'm so sorry.

856
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:10,532
It's my fault.

857
01:05:16,038 --> 01:05:17,789
I deserve it.

858
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:21,001
I shouldn't have lied.

859
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:23,754
I'm so sorry.

860
01:05:26,632 --> 01:05:27,758
Don't be.

861
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:32,471
Thank you very much for coming, Dong-joo<i>.</i>

862

864
01:05:54,576 --> 01:05:55,577
My apologies.

865
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,205
I'm very sorry.

866
01:06:00,624 --> 01:06:02,626
I can't pay your hospital expenses.

867
01:06:05,087 --> 01:06:06,088
Sorry.

868
01:06:09,049 --> 01:06:10,759
Byeong-su was being careless.

869
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:13,887
Don't worry.

870
01:06:14,262 --> 01:06:16,765
Our wedding won't get canceled
because of this.

871
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:20,602
Thank you

872
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:23,647
for being Da-min's friend today.

873
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:27,109
Please send my thanks to Dong-joo as well.

874
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:30,946
It wasn't good, but...

875
01:06:32,072 --> 01:06:34,741
I thought this would protect Da-min.

876
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:39,621
Well, now we'll have to go at it head-on.

877
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:44,668
I regret not doing that
from the beginning.

878
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:53,343
Oh, right.

879
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:57,639
Was dating Dong-joo also an act?

880
01:07:01,226 --> 01:07:02,227
Yes.

881
01:07:03,562 --> 01:07:05,605
I thought that one would be real.

882
01:07:12,279 --> 01:07:15,574
Tae-hee<i>, </i>don't do something
you'll regret later.

883
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:17,534
Like me.

884
01:07:19,828 --> 01:07:20,829
Then...

885
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:39,181
Let's go to the hospital.

886
01:07:43,143 --> 01:07:44,144
I'm fine.

887
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:48,523
I'm sorry.

888
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:55,113
You have nothing to be sorry about.

889
01:07:56,364 --> 01:07:57,365
But

890
01:07:57,949 --> 01:07:59,201
because of me...

891
01:08:21,973 --> 01:08:22,974
I'm sorry...

892
01:08:25,936 --> 01:08:28,355
for hurting you
to get that bastard's money.

893
01:08:34,486 --> 01:08:35,487
Sorry...

894
01:08:38,156 --> 01:08:39,991
for not believing your words.

895
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:45,997
Sorry...

896
01:08:50,961 --> 01:08:52,796
for lying that you make me uncomfortable.

897
01:08:55,257 --> 01:08:57,133
For lying that I don't like you.

898
01:08:58,426 --> 01:09:01,346
For wanting to hold your hands
but not having the courage to.

899
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:04,724
For making you do it for me. All of it.

900
01:09:07,102 --> 01:09:08,395
I'm sorry for everything.

901
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:34,754
I like you.
