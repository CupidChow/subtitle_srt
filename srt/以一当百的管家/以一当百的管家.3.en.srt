1
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:33,951
14

2
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,288
I can't just leave like this.

3
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:41,041
I need to pay for Yu-mi's student loans.

4
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,044
I need to get implants for my mother.

5
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:47,298
-Ouch!
-Goodness!

6
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,258
-I'm sorry.
-And the money!

7
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:50,342
Money?

8
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:53,179
-What money?
-Well...

9
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:54,972
Can you

10
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,141
help me?

11
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,726
-Me?
-Yes.

12
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:00,352
Okay, sure.

13
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:01,854
How much...

14
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:05,775
Well, it's one and eight zeros following.

15
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,820
-Well...
-Yes?

16
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:13,032
Oh, no.

17
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:15,326
I meant my apartment passcode.

18
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,077
It's 1-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.

19
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:18,788
-I see.
-Yes.

20
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:58,077
<i>If you look inside</i>
<i>my room's middle wardrobe...</i>

21
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,393
-Come on in.
-Thank you.

22
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:29,525
Give it to me.

23
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,111
The house is a bit messy.

24
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:34,321
Suk-chul wasn't a housekeeper.

25
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,871
Do you recognize him?

26
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,039
<i>Ding-Dong!</i>

27
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:48,085
I am a zodiac, born in 1974.

28
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,212
Yes.

29
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:52,298
I drove him home before.

30
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:55,593
Not too long ago.

31
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:57,970
It was only a few days ago.

32
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,806
This is all because of me.

33
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:06,604
I should've worked
to earn at least a dime.

34
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,481
All I did

35
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:13,485
was nag him to make more money.

36
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,280
It's because of me.

37
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,825
He had a wife
who was incapable of doing anything.

38
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,119
Hey.

39
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,080
Did you just sit around at home?

40
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:28,584
Or did he leave a large fortune?

41
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,671
There's not even a penny left for you.

42
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,925
<i>I have</i>

43
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,218
100,000,000 won here.

44
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:42,473
100,000,000 won.

45
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:49,939
He said he had a 100,000,000 won check.

46
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,568
That man...

47
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,153
He's talking nonsense.

48
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,241
-Come here.
-Okay.

49
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,791
You should throw out
his clothes and belongings.

50
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,001
-Okay.
-Everything's in this cabinet here...

51
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:15,422
And here... No, it's here.

52
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:16,966
-Here?
-Yes.

53
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:19,009
Let me get the trash bag.

54
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,223
He really said he had 100,000,000 won.

55
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:40,698
Why? What happened?

56
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,951
Are you hurt?

57
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,873
I guess the diffuser stain
wasn't entirely wiped.

58
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,711
-I'm so sorry.
-No, it's fine.

59
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,547
I should mop this with water. Hold on.

60
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,095
What are you doing?

61
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:05,097
No.

62
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,391
I can't find the mop.

63
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:14,982
I'm not doing anything bad.

64
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,234
So what are you doing here?

65
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,698
I'm going to use this as a mop.

66
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,409
TRUST ME ONCE

67
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,994
Trust you, for what? And why?

68
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,671
What is it? Did you get hurt again?

69
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:40,049
No, I'm fine.

70
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,176
You should be careful.

71
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,303
-Let me wipe it.
-No, it's fine. I'll do it.

72
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,597
You should clean out this side.

73
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,517
-Here?
-Yes.

74
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:58,150
Right now?

75
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:00,819
Yes.

76
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:11,205
-Should I open it?
-Jeez. Yes.

77
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:13,582
I'm opening it now.

78
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,293
I'm really going to open it.

79
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,853
What are you doing?

80
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,021
HERE TO FIND 100,000,000 WON

81
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:39,650
Trust me.

82
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,237
Hey.

83
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,281
Let's go for a walk.

84
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:48,325
It's too dusty in here.

85
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,246
I don't want to do anything.

86
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,123
Come on. Let's go out.

87
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,127
Let's go outside.

88
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,382
We can't just leave him here.

89
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,218
Jeez.

90
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,512
It's not like
there's anything to steal here.

91
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,639
He wouldn't take anything here.

92
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:14,768
What are you doing here?

93
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,274
How'd you get in?

94
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,153
Answer me.

95
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,488
-Hey.
-Yes?

96
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:28,782
Is it okay if we head out for a bit?

97
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,660
Well...

98
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,294
Yes, go ahead.

99
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,378
Thank you.

100
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,009
Is this funny?

101
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:56,101
What do you mean Eur-Wang-Ri?

102
00:07:56,643 --> 00:08:00,105
Okay, then let's at least go
for a drive near here.

103
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,983
No, last year...

104
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:07,446
Goodness.

105
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,282
That scared the crap out of me.

106
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:12,784
Right, thank you!

107
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:16,830
What are you doing?

108
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:18,916
Jeez.

109
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,586
You owe me 50,000 won, right?
I'll use that for a favor.

110
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,380
There's a white shirt box here. And...

111
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,799
100,000,000 won is in there.
Let's find it.

112
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:32,137
-No.
-Then pretend you didn't see me.

113
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:35,265
I said, I don't want to.

114
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,433
Jeez.

115
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,729
You should be grateful.

116
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,110
At least I was.

117
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,030
I was grateful when someone let it slide.

118
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:52,741
Anyway,

119
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,370
explain how you found out about the money.

120
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:57,829
Right, about that.

121
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,624
I'll explain after I find it.

122
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:06,922
It's the white shirt box.

123
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,050
Damn it. Where is it?

124
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:13,804
Jeez. Please.

125
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,348
What's wrong with you?

126
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:19,559
Why do you keep following me around
and bugging me?

127
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,562
Jeez. Let's just find that check first.

128
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:27,192
So how'd you know about the check?

129
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:31,154
Suk-chul told me to find the check
and give it to his wife.

130
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,199
And you're doing this in secret?

131
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:35,742
Like a robber?

132
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,913
Jeez. You're driving me crazy.

133
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:45,377
Who is it?

134
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,172
I beg you. Just once, please?

135
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:51,717
This is frustrating.

136
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:55,429
Hello, Vincent?

137
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,055
-I see.
<i>-Are you working?</i>

138
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,809
What? Yes.

139
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:03,395
<i>Any problems?</i>

140
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,689
Nothing, of course.

141
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,107
Just wing it.

142
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,984
-Just do the minimal.
<i>-What's wrong?</i>

143
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:11,778
I can just file for bankruptcy.

144
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,613
I always go out of business.

145
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,867
<i>I am</i>

146
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,036
<i>very happy.</i>

147
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,330
I am

148
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,541
very happy.

149
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,462
I'm very, very happy.

150
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,635
Goodness.

151
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:40,140
Jeez. Was he sure
about the white shirt box? Where is it?

152
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:50,067
Baek Dong-joo!

153
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:53,612
Whoa!

154
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:55,614
Thank you.

155
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:06,375
Listen.

156
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,419
I won't tell anyone you were here.
So can you stop now?

157
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,171
Look for it when I'm not here.

158
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,800
Our company, A Dime A Job,
is going out of business thanks to you.

159
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:16,968
How about this?

160
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:20,138
If you leave now,
something great is going to happen.

161
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,393
Nothing great ever happens to me anyway.

162
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:27,938
I'm going to let go, okay?

163
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,439
I said I'm letting go.

164
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:32,317
Three, two, one.

165
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:36,822
Thank you!

166
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:46,373
Dal-shik.

167
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,381
Keep in touch more.

168
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,426
I was busy getting God's love.

169
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:02,389
What's new with you?

170
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,266
Nothing in particular.

171
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,561
Something should happen.
You shouldn't be like me.

172
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,106
How long are you going to be alone?

173
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,859
You've got a whole life ahead of you.

174
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,486
Goodness. Stop talking nonsense.

175
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:18,530
Perhaps...

176
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:23,368
you're not over my sister yet?

177
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,414
I'm curious, though.

178
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,250
I wonder about her thirties,

179
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,171
her forties, and her fifties.

180
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,339
How will she be aging?

181
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,926
Would her fingers have gotten chubbier?

182
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:43,388
How about her white hair and wrinkles?

183
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,191
My sister is really lucky.

184
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,195
I guess you only remember
her blooming, beautiful side.

185
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:05,118
Nowadays, Dong-joo reminds me
a lot of my older sister.

186
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,455
She's becoming like her more
as the days go by.

187
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:10,665
She scares me every time I see her.

188
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,335
-You met Dong-joo?
-Yes, I see her often.

189
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,170
Where?

190
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,215
-Where?
-Yes.

191
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:22,260
Can you look for the white shirt box,
please? I'll leave once we find it.

192
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:31,978
Oh my God!

193
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,024
See, I told you it's here!

194
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:38,985
Hurry and open it.

195
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:41,780
If we open it...

196
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:45,742
There's nothing.

197
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:47,536
Leave now.

198
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,412
Wait, hold on.

199
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,250
I'll leave after I check one last time.

200
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,253
It should be here.

201
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:00,006
-Leave.
-I have a feeling it's in here.

202
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,634
You're not leaving?

203
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:05,428
It has to be in here.
This is driving me crazy.

204
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,847
Leave on the count of three.

205
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,017
Three,

206
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:12,727
two,

207
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:15,105
one.

208
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:21,611
Yes, ma'am.

209
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,074
I think you should come back.

210
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:30,996
I'm on my way back now
because I forgot my car keys.

211
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,372
Why? What happened?

212
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:38,670
What's wrong with you?

213
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,422
You shouldn't have come.

214
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,132
I won't do it again so let me go.

215
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,508
-Please, just once.
-Too late.

216
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,741
What...

217
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:09,784
What is all this?

218
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,997
But, why...

219
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,885
I didn't need...

220
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,555
I didn't need your help with this.

221
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,768
I only asked for your help
with Suk-chul's belongings!

222
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:38,063
Is this how you do your job?
I really don't understand.

223
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:42,275
I apologize.

224
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:45,070
I should have asked on Mom's Café.

225
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:50,158
I shouldn't have gotten
the business card in Suk-chul's pocket.

226
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,452
I shouldn't have made myself do that.

227
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,163
I should've figured out
something was off in the first place.

228
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,501
I'm sorry.

229
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:02,253
I'll compensate this
and leave after I clean.

230
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,047
I'm truly sorry.

231
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,593
Jeez, seriously.

232
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:11,763
Did you cut your finger?

233
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,140
No, I'm fine.

234
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,396
I'll get the bandages.

235
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:30,323
Goodness. What happened here?

236
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:32,826
Damn it.

237
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:34,703
I'm sorry.

238
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,001
What was that?

239
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,339
Did you hear that?

240
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:55,682
Hear what?

241
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,227
I heard something.

242
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:03,898
-I'll go check it out.
-No, you should stay there.

243
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,614
You'll break more things.

244
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,063
-Hello?
<i>-I don't want to go out.</i>

245
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,357
<i>I'm heading up, so don't come down.</i>

246
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,819
No, I'm on my way out already.

247
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,075
Clean everything up.

248
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,368
Okay, I'm sorry.

249
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:01,790
-Damn it.
-I'm sorry.

250
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:04,250
Don't come in. Let's go!

251
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:07,086
I want to rest at home
and not go to Eur-Wang-Ri.

252
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,339
You can rest in the car.

253
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,674
I'll drive you. Let's go.

254
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:19,724
You'll feel better once you get out.
Come on, let's get some fresh air.

255
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,027
Jeez. Hey!

256
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,367
It's 100,000,000 won.

257
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,162
I found the check for 100,000,000 won.

258
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,668
Whoa. We almost lost
100,000,000 won, thanks to you.

259
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,127
Look at it.

260
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,630
I told you it's here and I'd find it!

261
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,511
One, two, three, four...

262
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:59,097
It says 100,000,000.
No need to count the zeros.

263
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:08,439
-What are you doing?
-Stop.

264
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:09,732
I'll give it to you.

265
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,318
Only if...

266
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:17,824
you promise me you'd keep
what happened today a secret.

267
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:35,884
100,000,000 WON CHECK

268
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,345
I found it inside a trash bag.

269
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:43,474
Goodness.

270
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:45,351
I ripped this up.

271
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,104
It almost became trash.

272
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,523
It's too dusty in here.

273
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,485
That was a close call.

274
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,739
Thank you so much for finding it for us.

275
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:00,325
Also,

276
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:03,369
I'm sorry for what I said earlier.

277
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:06,414
Thank you so much.

278
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:10,960
I want to return the favor.

279
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,463
How can I repay you for this?

280
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:17,258
No, you really don't have to.

281
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:18,885
No, I should.

282
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,179
I'm just glad you found it.

283
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:28,519
I almost forgot about this.

284
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,441
Last time, Suk-chul mentioned that...

285
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:42,492
Please tell her

286
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:44,702
that he said he owes her.

287
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,706
He was too late.

288
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,877
And he's sorry for not repaying sooner.

289
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:03,096
I think Suk-chul really sent it.

290
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:18,528
I think Suk-chul really sent it.

291
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:25,535
You're going to be bald
if you pluck this much.

292
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:29,789
This is nothing compared to my friends.

293
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:34,335
Yong-kyu is already balding right now.

294
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:37,547
That's not what I'm saying.

295
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:40,341
What is it?

296
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:44,303
I'd be happy to pluck for you
if I got paid.

297
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:47,140
I always get your hair oil on my hands.

298
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,685
Fine, I'll pay you.

299
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,979
How much?

300
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:56,441
100,000,000 won.

301
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:03,031
100,000,000 won?
Then, is it valid until I die?

302
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:08,119
Not just until you die.
I'll do it for you in the afterlife too.

303
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,997
I heard it feels good
to have your wallet full of cash.

304
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,082
Let me know how that feels before I die.

305
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:18,421
What are you going to use it for?

306
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,720
First, I'm going to buy a piano for Yu-mi.

307
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,891
I'm going to throw away
your ragged white shirts.

308
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:31,017
And buy you new ones.

309
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:34,228
And buy 50,000 won worth of strawberries.

310
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,732
No, I'll buy 100,000 won worth
that's not on sale.

311
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:42,361
We'll enjoy the 100,000 won
of strawberries together. How's that?

312
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:52,580
Never mind, we need to pay for our loans.

313
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:59,921
You're acting like you don't know
what I'm talking about, aren't you?

314
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:02,757
Okay, fine. I'll give you 100,000,000 won.

315
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,552
When? When are you going to give it to me?

316
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,681
Honey.

317
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,018
For now,

318
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:18,773
I'll put this money on a tab.
It's more exciting that way.

319
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,442
You're not going to pay it back, are you?

320
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:23,027
No, I'm going to pay you!

321
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,743
<i>I think Suk-chul really sent it.</i>

322
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:38,543
I think Suk-chul really sent it.

323
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:44,132
I think Suk-chul really sent it.

324
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:46,509
Hey.

325
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:53,057
I think Suk-chul really sent it.

326
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:54,142
Hey.

327
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:59,480
Where'd he go?

328
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:07,238
Where is he?

329
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:17,206
I feel so bad for him.

330
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:20,710
Hey.

331
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,757
Where is he?

332
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:53,910
Why are you so serious?

333
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:57,580
Why are you looking at me like that?

334
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:00,416
Why'd you run off after finding the check?

335
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,293
Also, how'd you get inside the house?

336
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:04,879
How'd you know the passcode?

337
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,256
How'd you know about the check?

338
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:09,842
How many times did we meet?

339
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:13,179
-There was never a time it was normal--
-How old are you?

340
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,390
-Me?
-Thirty...

341
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:18,643
You're not in your forties, are you?

342
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:22,647
My dad once told me

343
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,774
men are mindless until their forties.

344
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,902
There are many things in life
you can't understand.

345
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,362
-And you don't know that, do you?
-So.

346
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,822
Can you please explain that to me?

347
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:33,699
Next time.

348
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:35,743
Next time, when I get a chance.

349
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:36,869
Next time?

350
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:38,496
No, thank you.

351
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,249
Hey! Kim Geon-woo.

352
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,042
Kim Geon-woo...

353
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:45,169
My name is Kim Tae-hee.

354
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:03,354
13

355
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,575
Ding-dong!

356
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:50,693
There's a strange girl.

357
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,239
She's really strange.

358
00:26:57,533 --> 00:27:01,078
-I don't know where it got messed up--
-More messed up than me?

359
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:02,538
Is she stranger than my fate?

360
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:05,499
Do you know what's really odd?

361
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:09,628
It's you thinking about that strange girl.

362
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,717
I'm the only one anxious.

363
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,969
You're too busy wondering about a girl.

364
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,974
Right, 50,000 won! Where's the girl?

365
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:23,309
Did you hear from her yet?

366
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:28,731
Hey!

367
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:39,742
I wonder who you took after.

368
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,203
They say I take after my mom.

369
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:46,332
Right?

370
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,919
I heard you went to the factory earlier?

371
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,670
-What?
-The factory.

372
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,965
-Yes.
-Why? You're making me nervous.

373
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:58,260
What is it?

374
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:02,932
I accidently said I meet you often.

375
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:06,060
It just came out.

376
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:09,271
Hey, you know me! I know what I'm doing!

377
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,816
I'm really quick at things.

378
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:15,778
He has no idea.
You know, he can be dull at times.

379
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:18,197
He knows me inside and out.

380
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,048
Dad, what are you doing?

381
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,885
Get out, I have to study.

382
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:41,679
-What is--
-Get out!

383
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:50,271
You know, right?
He's going to kill me if I get caught.

384
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,606
I'll be guiding you on your way.

385
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:59,196
-Should I live alone until the Fall?
-Is that possible?

386
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:00,614
No, it's impossible.

387
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:08,914
NO APPOINTMENTS TODAY

388
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,680
<i>A Dime A Job helped me find</i>
<i>my 100,000,000 won.</i>

389
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:26,390
What?

390
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:30,019
<i>Goodness. That's a huge amount of money.</i>

391
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,980
<i>Is it true that he didn't get</i>
<i>anything in return?</i>

392
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:35,649
<i>Yes, that's true. Anyway, it's a relief.</i>

393
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:38,944
<i>But what's that rumor</i>
<i>about him taking off with the money?</i>

394
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:42,490
<i>That girl asked him</i>
<i>to beat his ex-boyfriend.</i>

395
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:44,992
<i>A Dime A Job said</i>
<i>that they don't tolerate violence.</i>

396
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:47,369
<i>His belief in his work is very strong.</i>

397
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:51,040
<i>They say you are what you look like.</i>
<i>He didn't look like a fraud.</i>

398
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,375
<i>Shouldn't we help him get his favor?</i>

399
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:58,464
This is a high-quality errand-running
company, A Dime A Job. How can I help you?

400
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,675
Bedding and laundry? Okay.

401
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:08,098
Your dog needs
to poop while it's on a walk?

402
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:11,060
We have a 20-minute limit
for our dog walking services.

403
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:14,104
Hold on a moment.
I'm going to check our schedule.

404
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:18,776
There's an extra 2,000 won fee
every 10 minutes. Is that okay?

405
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:19,902
Let me see.

406
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:22,404
Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.

407
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,825
Hello?

408
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,995
Yes, this is A Dime A Job.

409
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:33,666
The 3rd? Just one moment, please.

410
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,878
You just need a ride
to the senior institute?

411
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:40,047
Do you need anything else?

412
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:52,142
<i>-I am happy</i>
-Happy!

413
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:55,437
<i>-I am happy</i>
-Happy!

414
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:58,190
Sir, can we get one soju and two udons?

415
00:30:58,274 --> 00:31:02,861
We made 800,000 won today.
Sir, please add eel and chicken feet too.

416
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,072
Adding eed and chicken feet!

417
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:07,700
Anything else for you, Director Kim?

418
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,577
-I'm a director?
-Yes.

419
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,329
You're the star
of A Dime A Job. You deserve it.

420
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:15,499
I have high hopes for you.

421
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,209
We're going to make a fortune!

422
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:19,962
Vincent.

423
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:21,839
What do you want to do with the money?

424
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:25,384
Well...

425
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:31,682
I should give my parents an allowance.
I'm thinking 150,000 won a month.

426
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,227
You should pay them more.

427
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:39,064
It's my first time making money.
Cut me some slack.

428
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:43,193
We're going to make a fortune anyway.
I'll give them a raise later on.

429
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:49,867
<i>I am happy</i>

430
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,204
Hurry up and answer.

431
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:00,461
-Yes, Mom?
-<i>You moron!</i>

432
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:04,131
<i>Why are you fooling around?</i>
<i>And don't drag Tae-hee into it!</i>

433
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:07,968
No, Mom. This is a start-up--

434
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:11,430
<i>Start-up, my ass! Cut it out!</i>

435
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,432
What do you mean?

436
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,768
Why are you cursing?

437
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:20,439
Thank you.

438
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:57,935
<i>Hello?</i>

439
00:33:07,695 --> 00:33:08,696
<i>Say something.</i>

440
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,158
I called the wrong number.

441
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,828
-Hang up--
<i>-No!</i>

442
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:20,874
Do you like samgyupsal?

443
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,043
<i>I want to buy you food.</i>

444
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:25,713
Since I found the check thanks to you.

445
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:27,965
Never mind.

446
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:34,722
Who wouldn't

447
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,306
like samgyupsal.

448
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:38,851
You see this? That's not me.

449
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,272
Then why'd you pretend
like you were his son?

450
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,483
-I did?
-Well, then, did I?

451
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:47,943
Yes.

452
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:49,403
Anyways, I'm glad.

453
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,240
His real son came
and got the insurance money.

454
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,325
I'm so grateful that you trusted me.

455
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:00,998
Here. Let me give you a new bandage.

456
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,171
It's not here.

457
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,299
Do you carry them every day?

458
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,010
Yes, I get a lot of cuts on my hands
when I'm working.

459
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:16,013
When did you start doing your job?

460
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,681
How'd you know?

461
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:19,099
Know what?

462
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:21,477
I got my third paycheck today.

463
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,561
Enjoy your meal.

464
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,605
I told you, I'll buy!

465
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,942
So.

466
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:30,652
How's work going?

467
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:32,905
I'm quitting in the Fall.

468
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:34,490
Why?

469
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:37,951
I'm preparing for the civil service exam.

470
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:41,455
Is this how you earn a living?

471
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:43,165
Well, that too.

472
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:45,584
I have bad luck.

473
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,337
Remember, I told you.

474
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,589
Nothing good ever happens to me.

475
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,926
So,

476
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,512
I decided to bear it until the Fall.

477
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:00,974
My dad thinks I'm studying
for the exam at an academy.

478
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:04,520
Do you trust me not to tell?

479
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,563
I could tell your dad on you.

480
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:08,273
I see.

481
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:09,608
To my dad?

482
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:11,944
You're right.

483
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:13,862
You should keep it a secret.

484
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:21,662
We... know a lot of each other's secrets,

485
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,288
considering how we're not that close.

486
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:38,512
But I have more secrets than that.

487
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:40,764
Aren't you curious?

488
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,432
No, not at all.

489
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:45,185
Should we order one more?

490
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:51,441
My grandma

491
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,528
used to always tell my uncle,

492
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:58,323
"I'd rather raise a cow than raise you."

493
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:00,284
This.

494
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,078
Are you talking about me?

495
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:09,877
Where are you going?

496
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:13,964
I got a phone call.

497
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:17,259
Hello?

498
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,055
Sir, can we get three more of this?

499
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:23,432
Okay.

500
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:44,328
What's this?

501
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:45,454
Is this for me?

502
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:48,707
It's just something I picked up.

503
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:52,502
Okay!

504
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:53,587
I'll use it well.

505
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:55,339
Thank you.

506
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,801
I'll pick it up for you next time too.

507
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,837
Dad!

508
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:39,174
Dad, where's all my clothes?

509
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:43,845
Where's my black shirt and black pants!

510
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,765
My T-shirt, jacket,
and cardigan are gone too!

511
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:49,851
-I threw them out. Move!
-Why?

512
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:52,104
I hate how it reminds me
of a funeral director.

513
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:56,525
That doesn't mean you could trash
the suit. It was a designer's.

514
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:58,443
I have nothing to wear for interviews.

515
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:00,654
You don't have to wear all black.

516
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,823
I said, let's go shopping!

517
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:05,158
No!

518
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:07,911
Okay, then.

519
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:09,454
Fine by me.

520
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,331
-Good morning, sir.
-You too.

521
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:17,462
-Dong-joo.
-Yes?

522
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,506
Did you buy new clothes?

523
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:21,299
How'd you know?

524
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,972
I wanted to look good
in front of the new interns.

525
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:35,397
This is the average size.

526
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,650
It's 2,490 square feet
and can fit about 60 people.

527
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:42,279
We have a larger room
on the third floor, but it's in use now.

528
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:43,655
I'll show you next time.

529
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:44,990
Okay.

530
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,158
Please, come this way.

531
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:52,497
We'll be coming here very often.

532
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,876
Simply put,

533
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:57,669
it's our secret passage.

534
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,465
-Hello, sir.
-Take it easy.

535
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,095
This is the resting area.

536
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:10,098
This is where we take breaks and eat food.

537
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:13,018
This way, please.

538
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:16,229
And in here...

539
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:22,110
This is the funeral parlor.

540
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:26,281
There's a resting area
right next to the parlor?

541
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,242
That's where we eat lunch?

542
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:30,994
You sleep there too.

543
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:33,121
But only when it gets busy.

544
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:34,372
You will get used to it.

545
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:36,917
There's no sign.

546
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:41,797
Because we're the only ones
who should know about the place.

547
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,133
Bereaved families sometimes come
while we're preparing inside.

548
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:50,013
At times, they barge in to see
the deceased for at least another minute.

549
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,015
They really come here?

550
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,101
How?

551
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:01,066
Superpowers?

552
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:13,620
Hey! Jeez.

553
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:16,373
Hello, sir.

554
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:18,792
I wondered where you were.
I haven't seen you lately.

555
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:19,918
I see.

556
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:23,004
I almost forgot. Come, follow me.

557
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:24,339
Follow you, where?

558
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,966
Leave that there. Come on.

559
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,052
This is Gochang watermelon.

560
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:30,720
Isn't this for you?

561
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:32,931
No, it's fine. Here.

562
00:40:33,974 --> 00:40:35,142
Thank you.

563
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:36,434
Thank you for the cake.

564
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:37,936
No problem.

565
00:40:38,562 --> 00:40:41,565
That day was
my daughter's birthday.

566
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,568
My daughter doesn't enjoy cake.

567
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,238
But she devoured that cake.

568
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:51,116
I was really grateful.

569
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,243
I wanted to come thank you for it.

570
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:54,703
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

571
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:56,913
Goodness.

572
00:40:56,997 --> 00:40:59,416
You should be busy. See you again.

573
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:02,210
-Yes. Thank you for the watermelon.
-No problem.

574
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:07,591
-Mr. Baek.
-Yes.

575
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,886
You're on night shift
starting next week, right?

576
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,012
Well...

577
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:14,222
Yes.

578
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:16,766
You haven't told your daughter yet?

579
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,688
I'm home.

580
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:24,774
Goodness.

581
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:27,903
What the...

582
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:29,696
Are you crying?

583
00:41:30,197 --> 00:41:31,323
Why are you crying?

584
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:35,202
What's wrong?
Are you going through menopause?

585
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:39,080
Be quiet. Eun-joo only has
half a year to live.

586
00:41:39,748 --> 00:41:42,667
Jeez. Is that really that sad?

587
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:44,586
She just met her mother.

588
00:41:45,212 --> 00:41:47,631
She even got engaged to the CEO's son.

589
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:49,674
But she's terminally ill.

590
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:51,885
I'm hungry.

591
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:57,015
Are those the same clothes
you wore earlier?

592
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:02,896
I told him I had to buy it
before the job interview.

593
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:05,357
I must've been out of my mind
because I was hungry.

594
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,902
How are you going
to last six months that way?

595
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:10,904
Why's it six months?

596
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:13,281
I'm going to put an end to what I started.

597
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:16,326
-What?
-Why's it the end after six months?

598
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:17,827
Don't try to understand.

599
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:19,955
You know how stubborn she gets.

600
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,874
I'm sure she's going to get caught.

601
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:24,709
-No doubt.
-What should I do?

602
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:27,587
You should get caught and get beat up.

603
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:29,839
Whatever. Damn it.

604
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:31,549
I'm leaving.

605
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,597
Grandma, I'll get going!

606
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,100
Dong-joo.

607
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,768
Take an umbrella with you.

608
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,938
Jeez. You're doing this again.

609
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:46,356
Look outside.

610
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:47,607
It's not raining, right?

611
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:48,817
It's not raining today.

612
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,151
-It's not?
-Yes.

613
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,113
-It should be.
-It's not.

614
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,156
-I'll get going.
-Okay.

615
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:57,450
I'm going to head out now. Bye.

616
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,620
Grandma.

617
00:43:00,704 --> 00:43:02,414
-I'm your granddaughter.
-What?

618
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:04,291
You're my granddaughter?

619
00:43:04,374 --> 00:43:06,001
Okay, you're my granddaughter.

620
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:07,168
No, I am.

621
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:13,300
Hey, you said you'd bring it.

622
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:16,928
Why don't you keep your promise?

623
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:20,307
If you can't even keep this,

624
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:22,142
what should we do with you?

625
00:43:22,726 --> 00:43:24,602
Hey, answer me.

626
00:43:25,395 --> 00:43:26,813
Answer me!

627
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:29,274
I'll bring it by tomorrow.

628
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:33,903
Tomorrow? You said that yesterday.

629
00:43:34,571 --> 00:43:35,947
How long do I have to wait?

630
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:37,907
Those bastards.

631
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:44,539
Do you want to keep getting beat up?

632
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:56,885
Who is that?

633
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:57,969
Me!

634
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:02,432
Crazy bastard.

635
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:06,061
Crazy? Is that how you talk to an adult?

636
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:07,270
Those idiots.

637
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:09,773
What a fool.

638
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:10,857
Hey, come here.

639
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:12,484
Come here!

640
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:15,070
I'm going to kick your ass.
I said, come here!

641
00:44:30,085 --> 00:44:31,086
What?

642
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:41,846
Let go of me! What's wrong with you?

643
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:46,226
Damn. Look at those eyes.

644
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:50,397
I'm going to let you two get a taste
of what it's like at the station.

645
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,481
Let's go.

646
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:52,899
That lady started it!

647
00:44:55,652 --> 00:44:59,155
Jeez. Look at these fools
lying to adults already.

648
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:02,117
Look.

649
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:04,285
How many eyes do I have?

650
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:06,037
How many?

651
00:45:07,664 --> 00:45:09,207
One, two. I have two, right?

652
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:11,251
With my own two eyes,

653
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:14,796
I saw you two bully a friend.

654
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:18,133
You should take her. My head
almost cracked by the stone she threw.

655
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:24,431
Where are you going?

656
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:26,057
Hold up.

657
00:45:26,141 --> 00:45:28,768
Hold up, justice citizen!

658
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:32,981
Damn. She's really fast.

659
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:35,066
She's a strong character.

660
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:37,193
She's totally my type.

661
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:39,696
You two, let's go to the police.

662
00:45:56,004 --> 00:45:57,005
500,000 won a month?

663
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,925
LEASE! SPACIOUS ROOM
RENOVATED

664
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:03,094
Only until my exam.

665
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:04,637
Okay?

666
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:06,473
Only until the Fall.

667
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,809
It'll help me concentrate
before the exam.

668
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:12,562
You can't even sleep until I get home.

669
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:14,355
That bothers me.

670
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:16,900
<i>You haven't told your daughter yet?</i>

671
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:21,404
I can't keep on cutting you some slack.

672
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:27,911
Do you have to live away from home?

673
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:31,289
Yes, I have to live on my own.

674
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,793
I hope you don't leave.

675
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:40,840
Dad, in your day,
everyone went to the temple to study.

676
00:46:40,924 --> 00:46:42,509
Do you know why it's different nowadays?

677
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,303
Information is key to passing the exam.

678
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:49,224
In dormitories, people share information
and are each other's competition.

679
00:46:53,895 --> 00:46:54,938
Yes?

680
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:58,149
It's just until my exam.

681
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,151
I'm really going to study hard.

682
00:47:00,235 --> 00:47:01,236
Trust me.

683
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:08,868
Yes!

684
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,558
The person should be here anytime.

685
00:47:32,684 --> 00:47:33,810
Who?

686
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:35,979
Our new neighbor moving into unit 201.

687
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:37,063
Is it a boy or girl?

688
00:47:38,106 --> 00:47:39,482
A girl.

689
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:43,987
Why are you telling me this now?

690
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,031
Is she pretty? Is she cute?

691
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,410
What's your type?

692
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:51,869
I like both pretty and cute.

693
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:53,538
Our types overlap.

694
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:58,042
I wonder when she'll arrive.

695
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:00,795
Can you take my shift today?

696
00:48:01,254 --> 00:48:02,255
You can take my pay.

697
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:03,798
Should I?

698
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:06,134
You wish! Jeez.

699
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:14,851
Your beef bone soup is
the best out there.

700
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:18,688
No matter how many times I go to those
100-year-old traditional restaurants,

701
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:20,481
none of them can compete with yours.

702
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:21,566
-Hurry and eat.
-Okay.

703
00:48:26,446 --> 00:48:28,906
Whoa. This is delicious.

704
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:33,661
You have to eat breakfast to study.
Why would you leave--

705
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:36,164
The decision has been made already.

706
00:48:36,623 --> 00:48:37,707
I'm not going far.

707
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:40,501
It only takes 15 minutes to Noryangjin
if you ride bus number 300.

708
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:42,378
I doubt you'd visit me often.

709
00:48:42,462 --> 00:48:44,631
This is like a forever goodbye.

710
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:46,966
Dad, just wait for me.

711
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:50,261
I will come back as soon as I pass.

712
00:48:51,304 --> 00:48:52,305
Okay?

713
00:48:53,181 --> 00:48:55,266
Put this in the fridge
as soon as you arrive.

714
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,643
Okay.

715
00:48:56,726 --> 00:48:58,728
Don't think it's a waste
and throw them out once they go bad.

716
00:48:58,811 --> 00:48:59,979
Okay.

717
00:49:00,063 --> 00:49:01,648
Whoa. This is so good.

718
00:49:02,065 --> 00:49:03,316
-Finish everything.
-Okay.

719
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,068
Have some of this too.

720
00:49:06,903 --> 00:49:07,945
Whoa.

721
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:19,582
Welcome!

722
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:21,334
Hello, sir.

723
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:24,420
-I'm sorry, I'm late.
-No, you're here at the perfect time.

724
00:49:24,504 --> 00:49:25,630
Welcome!

725
00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:27,131
Do you live here?

726
00:49:27,215 --> 00:49:28,883
Not as my house.

727
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,678
My nephew and I run a small company.

728
00:49:31,761 --> 00:49:32,804
What the...

729
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:34,055
What the...

730
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:36,265
What's going on?

731
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:37,975
Damn.

732
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:39,686
Why?

733
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:41,187
So...

734
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:42,689
The house next door...

735
00:49:42,772 --> 00:49:44,148
Right? My neighbour...

736
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:46,275
Yes.

737
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:47,610
Goodness.

738
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:49,237
It's me!

739
00:49:50,822 --> 00:49:52,949
The police! Don't you remember?

740
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:58,037
Remember the stone?

741
00:50:00,415 --> 00:50:01,624
Let go of me!

742
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:04,502
Damn. Look at those eyes.

743
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:05,670
Right!

744
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:07,296
The police officer!

745
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,381
Yes!

746
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:11,592
You had amazing hands!

747
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:13,720
I was so surprised!

748
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:15,972
You have talent in throwing.

749
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:17,807
You reminded me of Hyun Jung-hwa.

750
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:21,018
I used to play ping-pong.

751
00:50:21,102 --> 00:50:24,522
No wonder. That wasn't normal.

752
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:26,315
What's your name?

753
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:29,819
It's Baek Dong-joo.

754
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,529
Baek Dong-joo.

755
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:33,740
Even your name is pretty.

756
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:35,533
Dong-joo.

757
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:38,244
Don't step up like that anymore.

758
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:42,290
Nowadays, those bullies
cause the most trouble.

759
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:43,583
They don't listen at all.

760
00:50:45,168 --> 00:50:49,046
Let me officially introduce myself.

761
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:51,549
Far over there,
there's a city called Yeosu.

762
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:54,469
I'm Seo Hae-an from there.

763
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:57,805
Simply put, I'm from the Southern sea.

764
00:51:24,791 --> 00:51:25,792
Whoa.

765
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,465
It's nice.

766
00:51:34,884 --> 00:51:35,885
It's really nice.

767
00:51:37,053 --> 00:51:38,221
Is she pretty?

768
00:51:39,222 --> 00:51:40,640
She's just nice.

769
00:51:41,057 --> 00:51:42,183
She's not nice.

770
00:51:43,935 --> 00:51:46,479
She has arrived... in my heart.

771
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,107
Are you that happy?

772
00:51:52,777 --> 00:51:54,612
It should be on television.

773
00:51:55,488 --> 00:51:56,656
Listen.

774
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,867
It was love at first sight with that girl.

775
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:05,706
She made my heart bounce like this.

776
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:07,583
Where is she now?

777
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:09,335
Goodness.

778
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:11,462
She came next door.

779
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:14,507
Do you know what they call this? Destiny.

780
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:16,175
Is she that pretty?

781
00:52:16,926 --> 00:52:19,262
Back off.

782
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:23,349
You two should be my wingmen.

783
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:29,689
What I'm saying is... help me come up
with a strategy to do well with unit 202.

784
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:33,985
Hey. I should stay out of this. My mom
would kill me if she knew I'm doing that.

785
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,361
Vincent.

786
00:52:35,987 --> 00:52:38,322
This isn't just for me.

787
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:39,740
Think about it.

788
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:42,243
If the matchmaking
becomes a success in this building,

789
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:43,578
what does that tell us?

790
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:46,664
This place has good luck.

791
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:49,166
All the historical meanings,
the structure, the architecture...

792
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:50,710
What's all this?

793
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:53,254
This could be your marketing strategy.

794
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:56,799
This is good for everyone.

795
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:00,386
Goodness.

796
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:39,634
-Good night.
-You too, Vincent.

797
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,677
-Sweet dreams.
-You too.

798
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:55,126
My phone...

799
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:06,721
It's empty.

800
00:55:08,014 --> 00:55:09,265
I thought there was one left.

801
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:10,891
I forgot to buy it yesterday.

802
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:12,977
I can buy it real quick.

803
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,689
Our baby's being picky already.

804
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,901
Our Tteng-sam.

805
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:25,031
You should like something that's more
filling like samgyupsal or chicken.

806
00:55:25,114 --> 00:55:26,866
-Honey...
-I'm sorry!

807
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:28,993
Is there anything else you need?

808
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:32,663
A watch.

809
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:36,917
-Why?
-This is so worn out.

810
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:38,502
It's time to get a new one.

811
00:55:39,003 --> 00:55:40,337
It works perfectly fine.

812
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:41,964
I'll be back.

813
00:55:42,423 --> 00:55:43,424
Honey.

814
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:44,925
Hug me.

815
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:52,099
I'll be quick.

816
00:55:52,183 --> 00:55:53,225
Hurry.

817
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:27,134
Honey, did you forget something?

818
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,221
You should've told me.
I would've gotten it for you.

819
00:56:31,222 --> 00:56:32,306
What is--

820
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:02,336
<i>A 20-year-old pregnant lady</i>
<i>was found dead in her apartment in Seoul.</i>

821
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,171
<i>According to the husband's allegations,</i>

822
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,715
<i>the police believe it</i>
<i>to be murder by robbery,</i>

823
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:08,384
<i>and the police are investigating.</i>

824
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:11,220
<i>They are identifying the suspect</i>

825
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:14,056
<i>according to the surveillance cameras</i>
<i>and neighbors' testimonies.</i>

826
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:17,184
<i>Depending on the investigation,</i>
<i>the case will be publicized...</i>

827
00:57:18,144 --> 00:57:20,938
The case is just brutal.

828
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:23,941
And the husband is
blaming himself too much.

829
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,737
I asked that you please
take good care of this.

830
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:31,782
I understand what you're saying.

831
00:57:31,866 --> 00:57:32,992
If...

832
00:57:36,412 --> 00:57:37,997
I'll contact you right away.

833
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:02,188
Stop crying.

834
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:03,689
Yes, sir.

835
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:04,857
We shouldn't cry.

836
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:07,276
Funeral directors shouldn't.

837
00:58:08,444 --> 00:58:09,486
Yes, sir.

838
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:11,488
Dong-joo.

839
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:15,951
Do you believe in God?

840
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:30,758
I hope there is.

841
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:37,181
Director, may I step out for a bit?

842
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:38,307
Where to?

843
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:40,726
I want to prepare a gift.

844
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:41,936
For who?

845
00:58:45,064 --> 00:58:47,566
For the mom who's left her baby?

846
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:51,904
Or to the baby who was
to be born in four days?

847
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:58,410
Or to the husband...
who is alone now?

848
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:02,623
I heard they met at an orphanage.

849
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:05,292
They probably don't have anyone.

850
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:11,006
I don't believe in God.

851
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:40,577
Can I help you?

852
00:59:41,704 --> 00:59:42,746
Well,

853
00:59:43,414 --> 00:59:44,957
I'm trying to buy a gift.

854
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:46,625
How old is the baby?

855
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,380
The baby is about to be born.

856
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:56,593
How's this?

857
00:59:57,052 --> 00:59:58,762
So the baby can have a happy life.

858
01:00:19,575 --> 01:00:20,576
I am

859
01:00:21,869 --> 01:00:24,288
Baek Dong-joo, your funeral director.

860
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:28,959
Where am I?

861
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,295
Well,

862
01:00:31,378 --> 01:00:32,880
this is a powder room.

863
01:00:34,006 --> 01:00:36,467
It was a funeral parlor
just a few moments ago.

864
01:00:37,092 --> 01:00:39,011
Funeral parlor...

865
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:42,848
What are you talking about?

866
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:44,808
You are

867
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:46,852
spending the last few moments,

868
01:00:47,478 --> 01:00:49,104
before you pass away,

869
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,607
with me.

870
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:55,611
I'm...

871
01:00:56,362 --> 01:00:57,905
I'm dead?

872
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:00,574
Um...

873
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:04,745
Then, what about my baby?

874
01:01:05,371 --> 01:01:08,040
What's happening to Tteng-sam?

875
01:01:10,918 --> 01:01:11,919
I'm sorry.

876
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:13,379
My baby

877
01:01:13,921 --> 01:01:15,214
will be born

878
01:01:15,923 --> 01:01:17,049
in two days...

879
01:01:17,132 --> 01:01:18,926
That's 48 hours.

880
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:22,429
But I'm... dead?

881
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,401
Are you okay?

882
01:01:36,652 --> 01:01:38,237
Thank you.

883
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,239
-That's fine.
-Thank you.

884
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:41,990
No problem at all.

885
01:01:43,826 --> 01:01:45,202
This is quite heavy.

886
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,538
What's the address? I can deliver it.

887
01:01:48,247 --> 01:01:53,043
<i>The pregnant woman was murdered</i>
<i>when her husband went out to buy an apple.</i>

888
01:01:53,127 --> 01:01:56,588
<i>His wife had been having</i>
<i>bad morning sickness.</i>

889
01:01:56,672 --> 01:01:59,550
<i>People are in despair and in rage.</i>

890
01:02:00,175 --> 01:02:05,931
<i>Civilians and politicians</i>
<i>are mourning in the mortuary.</i>

891
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:09,726
<i>And Prime Minister Kang</i>
<i>has canceled all his plans</i>

892
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:11,270
<i>and paid a visit to...</i>

893
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:14,982
Then I'll give birth right now.

894
01:02:15,524 --> 01:02:17,734
Ma'am, please. I can give birth right now.

895
01:02:18,527 --> 01:02:19,695
I can give birth.

896
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:23,699
My baby will still be healthy.

897
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:25,534
The doctor told me.

898
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:27,619
My baby will be more than three kilograms.

899
01:02:27,703 --> 01:02:30,456
They even said
the head size will be 9.6 centimeters.

900
01:02:30,539 --> 01:02:33,542
I'll give birth right now.
Can you let me, please?

901
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:35,669
I'm so sorry.

902
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:39,256
No.

903
01:02:39,882 --> 01:02:41,592
No, why are you sorry?

904
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:43,594
Ma'am.

905
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:45,304
Ma'am.

906
01:02:45,804 --> 01:02:47,598
I can feel the movements.

907
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:49,266
Ma'am.

908
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:53,103
Tteng-sam doesn't deserve to die!

909
01:02:54,021 --> 01:02:56,273
Ma'am, the baby should be born.

910
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:58,442
The baby should at least be born!

911
01:03:15,626 --> 01:03:17,211
<i>Can I at least make a phone call?</i>

912
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:18,754
I need to call my husband.

913
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:22,758
Can I make one phone call
to my husband, please?

914
01:03:24,218 --> 01:03:26,428
It will be my last time, please.

915
01:03:35,854 --> 01:03:37,064
This...

916
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:38,774
This isn't working.

917
01:03:40,192 --> 01:03:41,527
Why...

918
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:45,155
Why isn't this working, ma'am?

919
01:03:57,125 --> 01:04:00,754
CHIEF MOURNER LEE WON-HO

920
01:04:01,797 --> 01:04:04,508
<i>The number you have dialed</i>
<i>is not available. Please leave a message.</i>

921
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:08,929
Can you dial it one more time?

922
01:04:09,388 --> 01:04:10,639
I...

923
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:12,766
I really have to hear my husband's voice.

924
01:04:13,392 --> 01:04:15,018
Ma'am, just once more, please?

925
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:16,812
-My husband. Please--
-Okay.

926
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,772
It's not hard dialing...

CHIEF MOURNER LEE WON-HO

930
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:51,638
Ma'am.

931
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:55,225
Ma'am.

932
01:04:56,935 --> 01:04:57,978
My husband...

933
01:05:00,022 --> 01:05:02,399
He's going to try to die with me.

934
01:05:02,858 --> 01:05:04,234
I'm sure he will.

935
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:08,614
Then, Tteng-sam's legs...

936
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:18,915
Mrs. Kang.

937
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,126
Mrs. Kang.

938
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:23,587
Mrs. Kang, wake up!

939
01:05:24,004 --> 01:05:26,298
Mrs. Kang!

940
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:27,507
Mrs. Kang, wake up!

941
01:05:27,591 --> 01:05:28,592
Mrs. Kang!
