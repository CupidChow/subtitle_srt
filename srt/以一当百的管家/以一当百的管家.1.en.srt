1
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:47,840
<i>She sheds a lot of tears.</i>

2
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:51,844
<i>She’s probably crying right now.</i>

3
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,183
EPISODE 1

4
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:32,218
I know her the best.
We’ve known each other for a long time.

5
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:40,226
Thirty years together and we never once
fought. Not even one curse word.

6
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,437
It seems like you two were best friends.

7
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:48,984
We couldn’t live without each other.
We’d laugh over nothing.

8
00:01:56,033 --> 00:02:00,788
I don’t know what was so funny...

9
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,172
That bitch.

10
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,876
Are you out of your mind?

11
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:54,341
Hey, are you out of your mind?
She’s my daughter’s friend.

12
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,845
She’s like a daughter to me too.
How dare you!

13
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:02,224
Who is she? Does she know Yeon-hee?

14
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:09,899
Ham...

15
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:23,037
There’s nobody to trust in this world.
Fucking bastards...

16
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,509
Fuck!

17
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:43,515
I hope you all
get fucked up and go to hell!

18
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,853
Hey... Um...

19
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,692
What are you doing at a place like--

20
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:55,653
How dare you have an affair
in a place like this?

21
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:59,198
-What?
-How dare you have a love affair.

22
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:00,491
What? I didn't!

23
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,826
What are you talking about?

24
00:04:03,369 --> 00:04:05,204
I have no idea.

25
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:08,624
Him and her!

26
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:11,877
They're having an affair.

27
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,465
What the hell are you rambling about?

28
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,717
Hey!

29
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:21,178
Darling, my ass.

30
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:39,530
You’re not fucking human.

31
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,241
I can’t believe you two.

32
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:56,255
How can you do something like that?

33
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:13,689
FUNERAL DIRECTOR - BAEK DONG-JOO

34
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,025
Slap on the face isn’t enough.

35
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:23,323
I feel bad for my mom, my sister,
and the rest of my family.

36
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,748
It's still better than doing nothing.

37
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:33,584
Thank you.

38
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:38,255
I never thought
I'd be blessed with friendly people.

39
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,632
I feel bad for Yeon-hee.

40
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,845
Cheer up, Yeon-hee.

41
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:48,640
You can't give up, okay?

42
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:53,687
That's right.
I'm never giving up on you, honey.

43
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:03,781
You're my savior.

44
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,617
And I met my savior after I died.

45
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,584
Thank you for touching my heart.

46
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,547
And thank you for listening to me.

47
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:27,012
I think I can
finally close my eyes in peace.

48
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,209
<i>Lilacs should be blooming.</i>

49
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,671
<i>Do know how special that is?</i>

50
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:06,552
<i>The summer that starts with Lilac’s scent</i>
<i>is really precious, you know?</i>

51
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,596
Yeon-hee.

52
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,101
Yeon-hee.

53
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,870
When will you get used to this?

54
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:38,458
I’ve never seen anyone slap
a bereaved family member’s face.

55
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:42,671
I can't believe you had those pictures.

56
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,761
His in-laws own
a famous galbee restaurant.

57
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:52,931
Only in Gangnam. They have branches
in Sinsa, Dogok, Apgujeong, and Nonhyeon.

58
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,476
Just the parking lot is 3,558 square feet.
The son-in-law is managing them all!

59
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,063
And why do you care
whether he took over all that?

60
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:02,482
Right, it’s none of my business.

61
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:05,027
Or not.

62
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:06,945
What?

63
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:08,780
Who are we?

64
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,992
Our job is to send our clients in peace.

65
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:17,623
You might be doing a good job
fighting for a rightful cause.

66
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:25,047
Her rage will disappear on her way.

67
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:59,748
15

68
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,879
We have sent one more away.

69
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:56,013
It’s interesting to hear
someone’s last words, you know?

70
00:09:56,847 --> 00:10:00,350
I don’t find any other job
to be as prideful as this one.

71
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,229
My heart is fluttering with joy.

72
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:12,612
Do you think I thought that? No.
There are so many crazy bastards.

73
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:15,324
Crazy bastards.
Let’s take another deep breath.

74
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,371
I should’ve gotten a talent
for ping-pong, or just a better brain.

75
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:24,541
Why keep bothering me?

76
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,544
Let's meet exactly 15 more times.

77
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,714
It should end at least in Fall.

78
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:34,509
We should visit Naesosa temple together
to see the Fall leaves.

79
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,262
Buseogsa is another option.

80
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:38,889
With you, Father?

81
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,932
-Is there a problem?
-No. Not at all.

82
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,226
I'm actually excited for the day to come.

83
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,981
I have no money or luck. There’s no way
of saving my pathetic life, so I’ll try.

84
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,360
Father, you know my dream, right?

85
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:52,694
It's to be a public official.

86
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,822
After this ends,
you have to let me be one.

87
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,824
That's out of God's hands.

88
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:03,330
Passing the civil service exam is on you.

89
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,919
Here. I’m always cheering you on.

90
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:14,091
Drink up and go study.

91
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,718
The sun's up. It's 7:00 a.m.

92
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:18,512
What's better than day drinking?

93
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:23,141
Nothing makes a person
more happier than this.

94
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,715
Hey, kid! No!

95
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,728
Hey! Do you want to get yourself killed?

96
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,356
I'm so sorry!

97
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,233
That must've been surprising! Sorry!

98
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,110
Are you okay?

99
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:20,657
Are you okay?
Why were you in such a hurry?

100
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,908
Han Sung-ah!

101
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,954
Goodness. I can't believe you!

102
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,999
Thank you so much. Are you okay?

103
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,375
Yes, I'm totally fine.

104
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:33,170
He looks okay,
but he's probably really shook-up.

105
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:38,091
He might have trouble at night. He might
have nightmares, diarrhea, or throw up.

106
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:43,805
They’re all common symptoms,
so please don’t scold him.

107
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,767
If he can’t sleep at night,
give him warm water or milk.

108
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:52,939
If the symptoms worsen,
please take him to the nearby hospital.

109
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,567
Okay, thank you.

110
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,737
Did you say, “Sir, thank you”? Or no?

111
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,156
Hurry and say thank you.

112
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,324
Thank you, sir.

113
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:04,743
It's fine. It's my job.

114
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:06,745
Thank you.

115
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,587
Are you... Ro-wun’s father?

116
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,048
No, I'm not.

117
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:22,219
Lee Ro-wun...
or was Min-chae on duty today?

118
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,597
Are you Min-chae’s father?

119
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:29,434
I mean, uncle?

120
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,396
I’m Il Dang Baek.

121
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:35,815
Dang-baek’s dad?

122
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,486
Call me whenever you need me.

123
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,280
There’s a grand opening discount.

124
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,700
WE GRANT YOU EVERYTHING

125
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,647
<i>We are listening.</i>

126
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:18,942
<i>Wherever it is or whoever it is.</i>

127
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,945
<i>To the first 15 people.</i>

128
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,698
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

129
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,659
<i>Yes, we’ll grant you whatever you need.</i>

130
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:41,464
<i>Did anyone see a lady in green</i>
<i>in front of Nokseak Elementary?</i>

131
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,675
<i>I was really surprised!</i>

132
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,178
<i>It was pure eye candy today.</i>

133
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:50,473
<i>It's an errand-running shop.</i>
<i>It opened last week.</i>

134
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:53,727
<i>Wow. That's a thing? That's amazing.</i>

135
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,521
<i>The store is called A Dime A Job.</i>

136
00:14:56,605 --> 00:15:00,483
<i>They need to look good in front of us.</i>
<i>Moms’ rules are everyone’s rules.</i>

137
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,277
Hey!

138
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:29,679
A DIME A JOB

139
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:48,073
Let's go.

140
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:02,003
You can't park here! Hurry and move it.

141
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,630
I'm sorry.

142
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,845
A Dime A Job is open! Take this.

143
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:15,266
Come on in!
Ma’am! Hey, beautiful, you’re here too!

144
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,354
Come and take noodles!

145
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:23,358
We have trash bags too! Everything’s free!

146
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:25,527
Free?

147
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:29,280
Yes, you just have to download
our A Dime A Job application.

148
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,032
What's that?

149
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:34,786
With just a dime, you’d be able
to get daily necessity services.

150
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,915
Just a dime.

151
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:39,999
A dime?

152
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,419
You’re too young to know.

153
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,337
Who pays to throw away trash?

154
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:48,133
That’s right.
Money doesn’t grow on trees.

155
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,969
You’re not just spending the dime,
you’re investing it.

156
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,347
To the precious lives of our housewives.

157
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:57,892

from an expert who has
tested for strabismus,

165
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,761
appraisal, accounting, et cetera.

166
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:18,181
We also take responsibility
to fight injustice.

167
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,685
TRUST US WITH ANYTHING

168
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:27,273
Trust us with anything.
We'll solve everything.

169
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:31,820
Oh! But no murder, crime,
or any illegal activities.

170

will take care of all of you who came!

Could we get some trash bags?

Of course. You all are so clever.

174
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,594

00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,150
Wow. I'm so exhausted.

178
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:20,034
Today was such an eye-opener.

179
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:25,665
I realized something at our grand opening.

180
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:29,043
-What was that?
-Working isn't tiring at all.

181
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:33,172
And that we can make
our 24 hours so worth it.

182
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:35,675
I had sudden enlightenment.

183
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:39,637
How about samgyupsal on this historic day?

184
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,681
Shall we?

185
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:45,184
Let's do it. What's the difference between
2,000,000 and 2,020,000 won in debt?

186
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:46,769
Let's drink somaek.

187
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:47,896
Okay.

188
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,402
Enlightenment has come.

189
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:00,909
Excuse me.

190
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:07,040
Today's event ended. I know it's hectic,
but we'll be back next week.

191
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:10,209
I mean, I'm interested in that.

192
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:12,420
A DIME A JOB
A DIME FOR EVERY JOB - HOW MAY I HELP
YOU?

193
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,923
Right! Yes, how may I help you?

194
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:19,093
I don't know if it's possible...

195
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:22,055
It is. Anything is possible.

196
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:28,144
It's for my girlfriend.

197
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,396
A surprise?

198
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:01,552
I'M OFF TO WORK

199
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,022
Dong-joo.

200
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,413
Manager.

201
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,497
Yes?

202
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:34,127
-My closest friend...
-Yes.

203
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:37,547
It's her and her bf's 100th day
anniversary, but he's not contacting her.

204
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:39,424
Why do you think that is?

205
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:43,803
So he can't be reached...

206
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,722
Can't be reached...

207
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,765
Does your boyfriend know
where you're working?

208
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:48,850
What?

209
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:53,354
Yes, I told him recently.

210
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,315
-That you're a funeral director?
-Yes.

211
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:57,358
And what did he say?

212
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:01,946
He didn't know what it was,
so I explained and he said that's great.

213
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,573
And that it's an amazing job to do.

214
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:04,824
I see.

215
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:09,370
-There's someone named Jolie.
-Jolie?

216
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:13,166
Yes. And I'm Brad. She's Jolie
and I'm Brad. You know what I mean?

217
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:17,420
-They met about 20 years ago.
-Wow, 20 years.

218
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,672
I wonder how she's doing. She got married.

219
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:23,801
-What?
-You have to have good nicknames.

220
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:27,972
Who ever thought Angelina Jolie
and Brad Pitt would break up?

221
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:29,849
I see.

222
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,860
-Get out!
-Fill it up, please.

223
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,279
-Leave.
-Why?

224
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,491
A hearse this early?
Get out, it's bad luck.

225
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,120
-Sorry. I apologize.
-Get your car out.

226
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:52,205
Yes, sir.

227
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:53,956
He's so rude.

228
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,968
Jeez. He's such a rude person.

229
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:09,138
It's okay. We don't have to go there.

230
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:10,973
That's not the only
gas station around here.

231
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:13,601
It's not like we'll ever see him again.

232
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,311
Would there be a problem?

233
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,940
-No. Not at all.
-Yes. Not at all.

234
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:22,360
-The problem is the person next to him.
-Next to him?

235
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:23,528
Yes.

236
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:27,156
Jolie's dad...

237
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:31,119
He really disliked me as well.

238
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:35,164
I've always wanted to

239
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,876
pour him

240
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:41,295
some alcohol.

241
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:48,928
<i>Sorry for the late reply.</i>

242
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:51,222
<i>I was so busy. Should we meet tomorrow?</i>

243
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,475
YES LET'S DO THAT

244
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,082
"Let's..."

245
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,627
"Let's break up."

246
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:26,299
Yoo Byeong-su asked me to say this to you.

247
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,511
Jeez.

248
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,352
I'm from A Dime A Job.

249
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,193
Also.

250
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,824
"The reason for our break up..."

251
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,245
"We're breaking up because

252
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,167
I don't want to hold your hand anymore."

253
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:14,013
"It's frightening to hold your hand,
considering what you're doing now."

254
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:25,566
Yoo Byeong-su asked me to say this.

255
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,694
Well, I'll get going then.

256
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:42,833
Excuse me.

257
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,837
There’s a grand opening discount.

258
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,131
Please give us a call.

259
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:17,034
Excuse me.

260
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,040
Kim Jipsa?

261
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,459
-Yes?
-How much is it?

262
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,129
How much did you get paid?

263
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:29,880
Well...

264
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:32,300
50,000 won.

265
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:42,643
What are you doing?

266
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:44,895
My name is Baek Dong-joo.

267
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:46,939
Ouch!

268
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,818
"I'm the one breaking up with you.
You bastard!"

269
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:52,862
Please tell him this.

270
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:57,074
Baek Dong-joo!

271
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:05,916
Did you call me?

272
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:08,586
Why are you taking it out
on the wrong person?

273
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,339
Did I say I didn't like you?
It's your boyfriend.

274
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:13,758
No. Ex-boyfriend now, right?

275
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:18,512
I just did what your ex-boyfriend
told me to do and say.

276
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:23,726
Okay.

277
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:28,689
I understand, but you can't do this.

278
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:31,650
And I think there's a misunderstanding.

279
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:35,488
We run a different errand service
than other shops.

280
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:37,198
We don't offer violent
and illegal services--

281
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:38,282
Murderer.

282
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:43,245
You're not a murderer
just by using violence and killing people.

283
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,247
You don't think this isn't?

284
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:49,210
Well, I'm not completely satisfied
with my hand either. No wait.

285
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,380
I hate it so much it's killing me.

286
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:55,257
But the reason why I'm enduring it

287
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:58,386
is because my hand...

288
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:00,221
My hand doesn't do that.

289
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,558
Giggling over a couple bucks.

290
00:28:05,393 --> 00:28:07,812
And putting people in misery.
My hands don't do that.

291
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,943
How shameful. It's pathetic.

292
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:23,702
Hey! Take your money back!

293
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:43,097
Goodness.

294
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,016
-Does that hurt?
-Yes!

295
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:48,811
I have to get hospitalized
for at least two weeks.

296
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:52,898
Article 260 states, "A person
who uses violence against another

297
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:54,316
shall be punished by imprisonment
for not more than two years,

298
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,278
a fine not exceeding five million won,
detention, or a minor fine."

299
00:28:57,361 --> 00:29:00,614
Goodness. What happened? If you want,
file a police report at our station.

300
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:01,866
-You're here.
-Yes.

301
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,703
Haven't I introduced myself yet?

302
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:08,456
You live on the second floor, right?

303
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:11,459
That's right. I'm from the south coast,
Jeonnam Yeosu. My name is Seo Hae-an.

304
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:15,004
Of course. I know you. I didn't
recognize you because of your uniform.

305
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,798
I didn't know you were a police officer.

306
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:22,720
The clothes make the man. Our station
is in front of Eonju University Hospital.

307
00:29:23,304 --> 00:29:27,766
Goodness. What happened?
This isn't a small cut.

308
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:29,310
Did someone kick you?

309
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,605
-Yes.
-Someone kicked you?

310
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,941
Goodness. I should investigate this.

311
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,236
Let's investigate this immediately!

312
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,948
So you're saying you got beat up
after you sent over a break-up message.

313
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:47,953
You should've made up an excuse
instead of provoking the girl.

314
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:51,415
Then do I tell her your boyfriend loves
you so much that he wants to break up?

315
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,919
You're right! That's not right.

316
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:57,296
This isn't your fault.

317
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:01,050
He doesn't have the guts
to break up with her in person.

318
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,761
She can't control her anger
and let's it out on the wrong person.

319
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:05,179
They're the ones who are at fault.

320
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,306
I'm curious now.

321
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,100
What's wrong with her? What does she do
that she doesn't like her hands?

322
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:11,936
-Hands?
-Is she into gambling?

323
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:13,812
Or kills dogs?

324
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:15,314
How would I know?

325
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:18,776
I figured it out.

326
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:22,321
Her hands are just an excuse.

327
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,990
Am I right?

328
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,785
If you really want
to end the relationship,

329
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:30,454
you have to be heartbroken.

330
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:33,123
If you totally lost feelings
for the person,

331
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:37,211
it's really hard
to see them crying over you.

332
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:40,297
He just lost feelings for no reason.

333
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,634
I could understand why he did that.

334
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,845
I could imagine
what kind of person she is.

335
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:50,307
She is...

336
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,520
-...a strong character.
-Strong character?

337
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:57,773
She's the type to get sick of easily.

338
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,069
<i>She used to play ping-pong.</i>

339
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:49,199
Yes, I played for about 12 years,
since the third grade.

340
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:55,914
<i>Were you good at it?</i>

341
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,667
I tried my best.

342
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:10,721
<i>But this place is a lot different.</i>

343
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:15,851
What made you apply here?

344
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:19,688
First, everyone dies.

345
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:23,192
Second, there's a higher rate
of people dying nowadays.

346
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:26,862
Third, I wanted to find a place
I can work for at least 30 years.

347
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:30,908
Last, funeral director was a perfect fit
because it has no retirement.

348
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:36,997
It's not easy to find a job
when you are an athlete.

349
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:40,417
I want to work here until I grow old.

350
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:47,758
Isn't it frightening?

351
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:49,593
Why would it be?

352
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:53,889
FUNERAL PARLOR

353
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:55,492
What the...

354
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:15,220
Dong-joo.

355
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:19,475
What's wrong?

356
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,192
Where are we?

357
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:34,740
Dong-joo.

358
00:34:36,617 --> 00:34:37,618
<i>Noona!</i>

359
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:40,454
<i>Noona!</i>

360
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:42,289
<i>Noona!</i>

361
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:45,626
<i>Noona!</i>

362
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,503
<i>It was a strange day.</i>

363
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:50,005
<i>The weather was so nice.</i>

364
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:52,216
<i>It was really strange.</i>

365
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:54,885
Dad.

366
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:55,969
<i>Dong-joo.</i>

367
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:59,014
Dad, please save me!

368
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,307
<i>Noona!</i>

369
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,391
Dad!

370
00:35:01,475 --> 00:35:02,476
<i>Noona!</i>

371
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,769
Dad, do you hear this?

372
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:04,853
<i>Noona!</i>

373
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:05,938
Dad!

374
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:24,998
<i>That I just took a nap</i>...

375
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:30,170
<i>That it was just a nightmare</i>...
<i>I wished someone would tell me that.</i>

376
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:37,845
Hey, who told you
to go somewhere like that?

377
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:39,429
How can you go somewhere like that?

378
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:42,140
I never told you to make money!
Aren't you too bold?

379
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:44,184
A funeral director? That's ridiculous!

380
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:47,104
How am I supposed to live in peace?
Or face your mother?

381
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:10,127
Don't even pee in that direction.

382
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:12,504
Don't go near that area.

383
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:23,682
It was just a scare.

384
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,100
Just surprised, that's all.

385
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,729
It's normal to be scared
after seeing a corpse.

386
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:32,983
It'll be okay.

387
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:35,819
Everything will be okay.

388
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:56,590
<i>Whenever I tried to forget about it</i>...

389
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:58,800
<i>Dong-joo.</i>

390
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,094
<i>Dong-joo.</i>

391
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,305
<i>Noona!</i>

392
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:05,349
<i>Noona!</i>

393
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:14,566
<i>Whenever I acted like nothing happened...</i>

394
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,531
Noona, why'd you leave me alone?

395
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:39,174
<i>Whenever I'd go on to live my life</i>
<i>normally and not think about it...</i>

396
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,511
<i>Left side of the stadium!</i>

397
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:08,370
<i>I felt like I had</i>
<i>all the bad luck in this world.</i>

398
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,127
<i>Did the devil come to visit me?</i>

399
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:18,130
I'm in so much pain, Father.

400
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:22,259
I'm scared to open my eyes,
or even breathe.

401
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:24,970
Please save me.

402
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:27,764
I beg you.

403
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:31,852
Father.

404
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:34,688
Perhaps...

405
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:36,815
Perhaps?

406
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:41,445
There are people waiting.

407
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,948
-What?
-I think...

408
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:48,201
...it'll be a good idea to go back

409
00:38:49,703 --> 00:38:51,121
to that place again.

410
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:52,664
You mean back to...

411
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:55,584
Back to the funeral parlor.

412
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,713
Don't you want to find out

413
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,050
who that kid is

414
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:09,097
and why he came to you, Stella?

415
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:12,559
And what kind of secrets your hands hold?

416
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:14,478
And what kind of talents you have?

417
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:16,063
No. I'm not curious at all.

418
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:18,148
-Stella.
-Father, why are you doing this?

419
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:21,359
Are you saying
I have the ability to see ghosts?

420
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:24,154
That's not true, is it?
It's because I was just scared.

421
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:27,032
This never happened to me
before or after the incident.

422
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:30,535
Right?

423
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:32,788
Why aren't you saying anything?

424
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:35,415
You have to scold me to pray harder.

425
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:40,962
You have to tell me that time will pass
and that I'm just talking nonsense.

426
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:45,050
You acted like you weren't aware
this whole time, didn't you?

427
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:49,554
I'm saying this because
this is the only way to solve the problem.

428
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:51,556
But still, how can I go back there?

429
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:55,102
No. I'm never going back.

430
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,978
I don't want to. Never!

431
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,280
Stella.

432
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,576
Stella.

433
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:17,541
Dong-joo! Goodness.

434
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:22,796
Dong-joo, are you okay?

435
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:23,880
I can't move.

436
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:25,715
-Where?
-My neck.

437
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,008
Your neck?

438
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:29,761
My goodness. God, please.

439
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:33,723
Father, do you know?

440
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,685
That you're so cruel and evil.

441
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,771
Why did you make me come into this world?

442
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,108
Why was I born? Why me?

443
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:46,903
Why? Why was I the chosen one?

444
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:49,030
Why did I go to a place like that--

445
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:52,993
You got a job there and met that kid.

446
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:55,954
It wasn't just for no reason.

447
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,081
Everything happens for a reason?

448
00:40:58,582 --> 00:40:59,833
Bingo!

449
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,960
Do you know what I'm scared of the most?

450
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:03,378
It's dying.

451
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:07,716
Leaving my dad alone in this world
and dying. I don't want to die.

452
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,304
But I think I'm really close
to dying at this rate.

453
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:14,472
There's no other choice.

454
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,943
I'll go.

455
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:30,030
I'll go back.

456
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:40,665
<i>God, I'll go back,</i>
<i>but can you promise me one thing?</i>

457
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,960
<i>When I meet them</i>

458
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,213
<i>and don't run away--</i>

459
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:47,839
My husband

460
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:50,300
is coming here soon, right?

461
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:53,637
Yes.

462
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:56,806
I have one favor.

463
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:11,947
<i>If I meet them diligently,</i>

464
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:17,911
<i>please let me leave this place.</i>

465
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:39,307
Do you like it?

466
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:44,062
Thank you.

467
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:18,555
20

468
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:20,348
<i>God, that's how many I'll do.</i>

469
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,518
<i>Just that many.</i>

470
00:43:25,312 --> 00:43:28,857
<i>So please keep your promise.</i>

471
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:33,820
<i>Please. I beg you.</i>

472
00:43:43,747 --> 00:43:45,373
<i>There's only 15 people left.</i>

473
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:47,834
<i>Let it be over.</i>

474
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:52,339
<i>My bad luck or a curse or whatever.</i>

475
00:43:57,594 --> 00:44:01,056
<i>How shameful. It's pathetic.</i>

476
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:14,611
Why? Does it taste bad?

477
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:18,823
-What?
-You look like you don't like it.

478
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:21,326
No, I really like it.

479
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:29,542
Wow, that's a big one.

480
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:36,299
Sir, here.

481
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,137
-Good for you!
-I'll get going!

482
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:43,264
Okay, have a great day!

483
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:45,266
Jeez.

484
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,229
DESIGNATED DRIVER SERVICE

485
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,981
You can leave yours here too.

486
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,902
-Would that be okay?
-Yes, of course.

487
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,071
Thank you.

488
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:17,882
Is there a good Chinese restaurant nearby?

489
00:45:18,675 --> 00:45:21,428
I'm sorry. I'm not too sure.

490
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:24,264
I don't usually eat Chinese food.

491
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:28,893
-Should I drop you off here?
-Yes, please.

492
00:45:37,152 --> 00:45:39,612
Here you go, sir.
Thank you so much. Take care!

493
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,806
-Wrap it up.
-Yes, sir.

494
00:46:29,496 --> 00:46:33,458
I'm Baek Dong-joo, your funeral director.

495
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:39,881
This was a funeral parlor,
but now changed to a make-up room.

496
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:43,009
Our manager will be here shortly.

497
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:46,346
Then, this place will
change back to a funeral parlor.

498
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:47,430
So...

499
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:51,768
you will be spending
the last couple minutes

500
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,229
with me.

501
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:56,606
I have plans today at Euljiro.

502
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:02,237
I was supposed
to drink makgeolli with my son.

503
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:07,283
I've postponed this plan two times.
Am I supposed to bail on him again?

504
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:10,662
Ma'am.

505
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:13,498
Please don't do this.

506
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:16,584
Can you please save me?

507
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:22,465
I'm so sorry.

508
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:27,637
Can I go home real quick?

509
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,223
I couldn't finish my laundry.

510
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:35,937
I have to water my plants.
And I think I left the stove on.

511
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:42,402
It's recycling day.
And I have payments due too. Goodness.

512
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:45,488
I'm sorry, sir. But...

513
00:47:46,823 --> 00:47:48,992
we're running out of time.

514
00:47:53,288 --> 00:47:54,497
No.

515
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,584
No, this can't happen.

516
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:00,545
I still have so much to do.

517
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:07,302
My son...

518
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:10,680
I have to find my son.

519
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:14,267
My son...

520
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:19,063
I have to meet my son.

521
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:26,529
REST IN PEACE

522
00:48:26,613 --> 00:48:27,947
<i>Your son?</i>

523
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:31,618
You have a son?

524
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:35,121
I want to meet my son.

525
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:42,253
I'm leaving too soon.
I have to at least see my son.

526
00:48:42,337 --> 00:48:45,340
If you give me his number,
I'll contact him.

527
00:48:49,344 --> 00:48:50,345
I'm...

528
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:54,599
I'm a bad person.

529
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:58,353
<i>We will be filing for bankruptcy.</i>

530
00:48:58,436 --> 00:48:59,812
<i>It was a while back.</i>

531
00:49:05,777 --> 00:49:08,988
Just for three months, please?

532
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:13,117
Stop the nonsense!
How am I supposed to babysit your son?

533
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:16,204
I can't take him with me
to my sailing work.

534
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:20,625
I can't take him to his dead mother.
You are my last resort.

535
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,169
Hey, I don't think we should
be asking each other for favors.

536
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:30,218
Here, I got an advance. Take this.

537
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:39,310
Please, I beg you.
Just for three months, okay?

538
00:49:49,404 --> 00:49:53,533
Damn it. Excuse me, ma'am!

539
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:56,953
-Yes, sir.
-Is this hand-made?

540
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:01,124
This tastes amazing!

541
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,918
I ordered it from the Internet.

542
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,963
I see.

543
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:10,758
Cutie-pie!

544
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:12,719
Yes, honey!

545
00:50:13,136 --> 00:50:16,889
-Find this on the Internet.
-Okay, hold on.

546
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,183
What are you doing?

547
00:50:20,143 --> 00:50:22,395
One, two, three!

548
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:27,483
<i>He was my step-brother,</i>

549
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,613
<i>but I had nobody else to go to.</i>

550
00:50:56,596 --> 00:50:57,597
Does it taste good?

551
00:50:58,014 --> 00:50:59,056
Yes.

552
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:01,142
Goodness. Come here.

553
00:51:02,894 --> 00:51:04,479
You got everything on your face.

554
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:10,860
I'll buy you jjajangmyeon again soon.

555
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,780
Really? When? Promise me.

556
00:51:14,197 --> 00:51:15,198
I promise.

557
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:17,992
But...

558
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:23,164
you have to stay
with your uncle for three days.

559
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:25,917
I'll pick you up after three nights.

560
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:30,880
-Let's eat this again after three nights.
-No, I don't want to.

561
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:34,425
My son, you're good at listening, right?

562
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:39,347
No, I want to be with you.

563
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:44,894
I'll buy you jjajangmyeon again
after just three nights.

564
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:47,939
No, I want to go with you.

565
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:54,028
Goodness. Why aren't you listening to me,
my son?

566
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,117
I'll be back real soon.

567
00:52:02,245 --> 00:52:04,288
Dad!

568
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:12,255
Dad!

569
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:14,715
Okay!

570
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:18,344
Are you okay?

571
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:20,388
-Dad!
-My son!

572
00:52:58,509 --> 00:53:01,762
<i>It probably left a huge scar.</i>

573
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:07,643
<i>So your son</i>...

574
00:53:07,977 --> 00:53:08,978
Stay here.

575
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,314
I'm going to use the restroom.

576
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:25,661
<i>I came looking for him after three months.</i>

577
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:28,998
But he disappeared.

578
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:34,545
It's all my fault.

579
00:53:36,339 --> 00:53:38,925
It's my mistake leaving my son to him.

580
00:53:44,096 --> 00:53:46,849
I've always carried around a cross.

581
00:53:46,933 --> 00:53:48,517
There's not a place I didn't go.

582
00:53:50,478 --> 00:53:54,023
I even went to the end of the village,
Baekryungdo and Manjaedo.

583
00:53:54,941 --> 00:53:56,817
I've looked around everywhere.

584
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:58,986
Where could he be?

585
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:03,074
I want to know if he's even alive.

586
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:05,618
I've waited for so long...

587
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:10,706
I thought I'd see him before I die.

588
00:54:29,517 --> 00:54:31,185
I think there's a possibility with you.

589
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:36,482
You're capable of finding my son.

590
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:39,443
Me?

591
00:54:40,236 --> 00:54:42,530
No, there's no way I can.

592
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,865
I know it's nonsense.

593
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:46,909
But you...

594
00:54:48,411 --> 00:54:49,745
came to me like this.

595
00:54:50,246 --> 00:54:51,455
Does this make sense?

596
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:54,000
It's a miracle.

597
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:56,085
Miracle...

598
00:54:58,295 --> 00:54:59,672
It's happening right now!

599
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:13,352
<i>Am I quick to give up?</i>

600
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,021
<i>Yes.</i>

601
00:55:15,563 --> 00:55:16,605
<i>Am I realistic?</i>

602
00:55:17,023 --> 00:55:18,065
<i>Yes, extremely.</i>

603
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:23,320
<i>Sir, you couldn't find him for 25 years.</i>
<i>Who am I to...</i>

604
00:55:24,113 --> 00:55:26,615
<i>How will I be able to find your son?</i>

605
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:33,873
<i>Do I work hard?</i>

606
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:35,374
<i>Definitely, yes.</i>

607
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:38,794
<i>I'm more desperate than anyone!</i>
<i>Every one person is important to me!</i>

608
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:42,006
<i>No, what's not possible is not possible.</i>

609
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:44,759
<i>I don't think I'll be able to do it.</i>

610
00:55:45,176 --> 00:55:47,094
<i>But I still have to find him...</i>

611
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:51,849
<i>No, I can't find him. Never!</i>

612
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:55,311
<i>This is driving me crazy!</i>

613
00:55:56,771 --> 00:56:01,650
Hey, I don't think you're ready to mourn.

614
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:05,154
That's why we're breaking up for a while.

615
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:07,406
Yeon-jae.

616
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:10,409
-Yes, honey.
-Bring more medicine.

617
00:56:10,493 --> 00:56:12,244
-Director.
-Hold on.

618
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:20,294
It's so empty here.
Funerals should be more crowded.

619
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:24,381
This belongs to Joon-ho.
Should I contact the person in here?

620
00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:29,220
Let's just keep quiet.

621
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:34,225
This funeral is for me.
Why make it more bothersome?

622
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:39,730
You never know what's going to happen.
Let's just not risk anything.

623
00:56:40,648 --> 00:56:44,860
-You're talking about your nephew, right?
-Nephew, my ass.

624
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:46,987
Didn't you say he had a son?

625
00:56:47,655 --> 00:56:48,823
Shh.

626
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:58,958
I feel guilty taking the insurance money.

627
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:03,379
Your heart is so weak.

628
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:04,463
I know, right?

629
00:57:06,132 --> 00:57:10,845
Are you flying to Hawaii
with the insurance money?

630
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:12,638
I want to fly business.

631
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:13,806
Not just business class.

632
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:16,642
We'll also rent a private jet,
the one the President rides.

633
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:18,894
You're so amazing!

634
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:25,526
So don't even look at this stuff, okay?

635
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:28,154
Okay.

636
00:57:28,237 --> 00:57:29,363
Where's my medicine?

637
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,532
I'll bring it to you.

638
00:57:31,991 --> 00:57:34,368
Okay. Thank you, Miss Baek.

639
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:03,189
It's probably not in here.

640
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:06,901
<i>What should I do?</i>

641
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:21,790
KIM JOON-HO'S FUNERAL
EONJU UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL FUNERAL

642
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:41,018
KIM JOON-HO'S FUNERAL
LOOKING FOR HIS SON KIM GEON-WOO

643
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:07,002
SON MISSING AT BONGJU STATION

644
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:38,075
-Dong-ju.
-Yes.

645
00:59:39,285 --> 00:59:40,911
-Are you waiting for someone?
-No.

646
01:00:08,397 --> 01:00:09,398
<i>He can't be...</i>

647
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:18,073
No way...

648
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:49,355
-I'm sorry.
-You're supposed to pay in cash.

649
01:00:49,772 --> 01:00:52,733
I was supposed to go to room nine,
but I was in shock so...

650
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:55,277
This...

651
01:00:59,907 --> 01:01:02,201
-This one?
-No, the one next to that.

652
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:06,705
Thank you.

653
01:01:13,212 --> 01:01:14,463
I thought that was his son.

654
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:22,679
-Honey.
-Yes?

655
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:26,850
Can we just leave like this?
Your dead brother's alone.

656
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:28,852
What's the problem with that?

657
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,773
I'll pay for our second,
third, and fourth rounds! Let's go.

658
01:01:34,233 --> 01:01:36,151
Okay, let's go!

659
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:40,864
Goodness.

660
01:01:40,948 --> 01:01:42,658
Let's go home too!

661
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:44,785
Yes, sir.

662
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:51,375
Manager.

663
01:01:53,669 --> 01:01:57,423
I think I left something inside.
I should go back and get it.

664
01:01:57,881 --> 01:01:59,550
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

665
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:01,260
See you tomorrow.

666
01:02:13,772 --> 01:02:15,357
You're not giving me beer today?

667
01:02:17,151 --> 01:02:19,194
-Do you want it?
-No.

668
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:26,034
I want to go home and sleep.
It's not like the son's going to show up.

669
01:02:27,035 --> 01:02:28,537
Who knows?

670
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:30,998
Didn't God say...

671
01:02:32,124 --> 01:02:38,672
do not doubt oneself.
Once you believe, it will come true.

672
01:03:58,794 --> 01:03:59,962
Kim Jip-sa?

673
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:01,838
Yes.

674
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:13,267
<i>It probably left a huge scar.</i>

675
01:04:29,908 --> 01:04:32,160
Your son is here.

676
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,858
<i>He was going to be lonely</i>
<i>if you hadn't come.</i>

677
01:05:03,859 --> 01:05:07,321
<i>I know you're resentful.</i>
<i>I understand you don't want to see him.</i>

678
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:08,822
<i>You think you know everything?</i>

679
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,699
<i>Right, you probably don't know.</i>

680
01:05:10,782 --> 01:05:13,285
You need to get paid
to go to your own father's funeral.

681
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:16,455
You shouldn't be the one to talk.
Who's the one who paid me to hit someone?

682
01:05:16,538 --> 01:05:19,499
-Baek Dong-joo.
-Who the hell are you?

683
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:23,420
<i>We're really about to close down!</i>

684
01:05:23,503 --> 01:05:27,007
<i>There's a lot of things</i>
<i>you can't solve with money.</i>

685
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,134
Why'd you take the money?

686
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:52,699
You really broke up?

687
01:05:52,783 --> 01:05:57,537
Think about it. How can I hold her hand
when she touches corpses.

688
01:05:57,788 --> 01:05:59,456
Yes, that's a bit disgusting.

689
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:02,209
I get goosebumps just thinking about it.

690
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:08,382
Wow I just got the chills.
It's so horrible.

691
01:06:09,216 --> 01:06:10,217
What the...

692
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,843
Hey, isn't this bird poop?

693
01:06:13,762 --> 01:06:15,555
Now your hands are more disgusting!

694
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:18,850
It's funny, isn't it?

695
01:06:20,102 --> 01:06:21,436
Stop it!
