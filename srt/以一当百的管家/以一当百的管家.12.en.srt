Grandma.

2
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:35,494
Yes?

3
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:38,789
This is my grandchild.
He's good-looking, right?

4
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:44,628
Wait…

5
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:46,922
This boy…

6
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,008
Yes.

7
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:51,719
Tae-hee's younger brother.

8
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:53,888
Our youngest.

9
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:07,902
Grandma!

10
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,406
<i>I have a younger brother.</i>

11
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:14,450
<i>My younger brother…</i>

12
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:20,706
He died…

13
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,377
He died

14
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:29,340
because of me…

15
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:44,230
I'll get going first.

16
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:47,900
Dong-joo <i>ssi!</i>

17
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:52,404
Oh my… She must have
remembered something urgent.

18
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,282
-Huh?
-What kind of fate

19
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:59,703
was such a beautiful young lady born with
to be in such a rough occupation?

20
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:02,915
Well, I guess
no one can go against their fate.

21
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,466
A DIME A JOB

22
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,815
-Try it.
-I used a date I'd never forget.

23
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,529
It's the anniversary of my brother's death.

24
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,030
When is it?

25
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,241
It's the ninth.

26
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:53,674
TAE-HEE

27
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,765
<i>I left the ring in front of Bongsu Market.</i>

28
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,934
<i>I have to bring it to my hyeong!</i>

29
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,729
<i>If you were there at that time…</i>

30
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:12,902
<i>If you were by my side.</i>
<i>Only if…</i>

31
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,868
<i>I understand now.</i>

32
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,254
I'm so sorry.

33
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,593
For taking this long to realize.

34
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:41,639
I'm so sorry.

35
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,569
TAE-HEE

36
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,960
<i>Let's meet up later.</i>

37
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,253
<i>I have something to tell you.</i>

A DIME A JOB

39
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,623
Is that you, Mom?

40
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,376
The TV show ended earlier.

41
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,294
It's Hae-an.

42
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,088
Oh, it was you, Hae-an.

43
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,216
-Is your mother visiting?
-Yeah.

44
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:03,345
Where is she?
I better give her a deep bow.

45
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:06,515
Who knows.
Well, I don't recommend it either way.

46
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,518
You might end up
bleeding out of your ears.

47
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,896
-Oh, you can put that back over there.
-Okay. Thank you.

48
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,981
No prob.

49
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:47,181
Whoa, what are these?

50
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,224
Hey!

51
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,692
-What is it?
-It's nothing.

52
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,195
I saw it all already.

53
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:05,449
Wasn't that a lab coat
Tae-hee <i>seong-nim </i>was wearing? Hm?

54
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,744
A doctor, or something like that?

55
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:12,956
Yeah…

56
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:19,421
Oh man, for real?

57
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,885
Then what's he
wasting his life away here for?

58
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,847
Hey! You calling
A Dime A Job a waste of life?

59
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,518
You little punk,
tell me how you really feel!

60
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,019
That's not what I meant.

61
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:42,111
By the way, I saw that

62
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:44,863
there was also a kid.

63
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,743
Who's that?
Is he from the hospital?

64
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,038
Just pretend you didn't notice.

65
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:54,498
Well,

66
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:58,001
he can't be something like,
a secret child, right?

67
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:03,173
Oh man, why you staying silent?
Was I right?

68
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,259
You.

69
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,053
Don't say anything in front of Tae-hee.

70
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,680
What would I say?

71
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,433
You haven't told me
anything to not say, yet!

72
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,816
Little brother.

73
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,069
Huh?

74
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,197
That's Tae-hee's little brother.

75
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:34,288
L… Little brother…

76
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:40,127
He… had a brother that young?

77
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,671
Yeah…

78
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,465
But…

79
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,177
He left this world.

80
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,641
-Hey.
-Yes.

81
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:58,270
So you better not act like
you know anything about this, alright?

82
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,022
Don't tell Tae-hee anything!

83
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:02,316
Okay…

84
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,819
Why did you have to
bring these pictures out?!

85
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,537
Do you know
how worried I was about you all day?

86
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:21,877
I wondered, "Did something happen,
is she getting sick," you know?

87
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:34,181
-Uh… If my Grandma--
-Tae-hee <i>ssi.</i>

88
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:50,530
I saw the picture
on your grandmother's phone.

89
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,705
Your little brother.

90
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,544
I…

91
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,844
met your little brother.

92
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,939
I'm so sorry. I…

93
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,484
I was so scared, I ran away from him.

94
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:31,780
I'm…

95
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,157
I'm so sorry…

96
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,034
<i>While working this job</i>

97
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:41,039
<i>I met a child, exactly once.</i>

98
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,627
-You've even met a child?
-Yeah.

99
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:50,048
He was considerate.

100
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,677
<i>A child who worry about others</i>

101
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,013
<i>more than himself…</i>

102
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,307
The child I met that one time

103
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,227
was Joon-ho.

104
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,998
I'm so sorry.

105
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,668
I left Joon-ho alone and ran away.

106
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:29,963
I'm… I'm so sorry.

107
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:38,930
Joon-ho…

108
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,143
How was he?

109
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,106
He would have been so scared.

110
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,443
He would have been in so much pain.

111
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,116
What did Joon-ho say?

112
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,789
I should have delivered these back then…

113
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:09,544
Joon-ho…

114
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:12,506
asked me to deliver this to you.

115
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,128
Please help me…

116
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:30,977
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

117
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,981
<i>I was too late on the delivery.</i>

118
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:40,737
<i>And…</i>

119
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,536
<i>Also for leaving Joon-ho</i>
<i>alone in the room…</i>

120
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,373
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

121
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:56,503
<i>No.</i>

122
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,006
<i>Don't say such a thing.</i>

123
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:04,803
<i>You don't have to be sorry.</i>

124
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:52,934
A DIME A JOB

125
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:54,811
Why don't you stay a few more nights?

126
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,231
I would rather leave
than continue looking at you.

127
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,025
you don't want to see N<i>oona?</i>

128
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,988
Your sister is so festered inside,

129
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,407
I don't want to see her like that.

130
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,870
Alright. Let me
give you a ride home, then.

131
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:16,374
No, thanks! Not in a car like that.
I'd rather take a taxi.

132
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:18,460
We insist.

133
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,086
You do?

134
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:24,549
I can't refuse my little puppy insisting.

135
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:30,388
I will, then. Make sure you eat well,
and take care of yourself.

136
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,058
You need to gain some weight.

137
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,561
Obey your moth…

138
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:42,817
You don't have to obey your uncle.
<i>Don't </i>obey your uncle!

139
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:44,736
He doesn't, to begin with!

140
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:48,573
Mom, there is no order and discipline
in the household because of you!

141
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:50,283
You little… Come over here.

142
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:53,244
You cut your ridiculous hair right now.
Cut your hair!

143
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:55,288
Mom, ancestors said
"Body parts come from parents,"

144
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,082
 and "You may cut off my head
but not my hair!"

145
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,292
"Body parts" my butt.
Come over here!

146
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:02,796
-I'll kill you and kill myself too!
-Ow, ow!

147
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:23,733
<i>Make this for your sister when she</i>
<i>gets here. Don't eat it all by yourself!</i>

148
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:25,402
Psh.

149
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,613
And she would run away
before her daughter gets here.

150
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:47,465
This kid, picking pictures
without me in it.

151
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,636
Everyone always leaves me out.

152
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,336
-Oh.
-Hello.

153
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,173
-Are you getting off work now?
-Yes.

154
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,388
-Mom!
-I told you not to come here.

155
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,600
-Didn't I tell you to stay home?
-But I'm hungry.

156
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:41,019
-There's nothing to eat at home.
-Shush.

157
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,814
Go home and eat this.

158
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,567
-When will you be home?
-I'll be late today.

159
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:52,405
Go home now.
Be safe. Get home quickly!

Baek Dong-joo.

161
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,424
By the way, why did Grandma leave early?

162
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:17,639
Day after tomorrow
is the death anniversary.

163
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,853
Grandma really adored my brother.

164
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:30,360
She must not be ready yet.

165
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,488
Same with seeing my mother.

166
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,990
Oh, then your parents are…

167
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,244
They are coming tomorrow.

168
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:45,250
Where are they coming from?

169
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:49,754
-<i>Goheung.</i>
-I see… They moved really far.

170
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,550
I've been to their previous home.

171
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,344
To deliver the ring
as soon as possible.

172
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:02,767
If it was a police officer rather than me
that found the ring

173
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,270
would you have gotten it on time?

174
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:07,856
Huh?

175
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,109
Oh, because Joon-ho told me

176
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:15,113
to ask a police officer
if I can't find the ring.

177
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,156
A police officer?

178
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,451
Mhm.

184
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:03,912
Hey there.

185
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:09,167
You come here every time you drink.
Send in a complaint to take him.

186
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,878
-I'm in the Civil Complaints Division.
-Good for you!

187
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,004
How've you been?

188
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:17,258
Seo Hae-an, you were top
of the class at the police academy?

189
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,053
Huh? That makes no sense.

190
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:23,431
-Yes, Traffic Incident Investigations.
-Yes.

191
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,558
Must be why you looked familiar.

192
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:29,479
-I go there every year to give a lecture.
-I see. I understand.

193
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,189
-This is pretty good.
-I see.

194

Let's go.

195
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,525
-Huh?
-Eonju Uni Hospital.

196
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,028
-Yessir.
-Not you. Come on!

197
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:39,530
See ya.

198
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:01,052
Oh, I'm sorry.

199
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,596
It's nothing.

200
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:05,974
One sec.
Excuse me!

201
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,645
You dropped this.

202
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:13,690
Oh.

203
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:16,359
Thank you.

204
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:21,114
Why else would I call?

205
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,908
I'm reporting that I got
into the ICU. Where you at?

206
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:27,829
Oh. I'm on my way home.
Hey, the bus is here. I'm hanging up.

207
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:32,500
<i>The bus? No way, what bus at this hour?</i>
<i>I bet you're with your boyfriend.</i>

208
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,712
<i>Are you on a date?</i>
<i>What are you doing out this late!</i>

209
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:39,465
Express buses these days
extended its hours to run this late.

210
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,593
-I'm hanging up.
-<i>Stop saying that. Put him on the phone!</i>

211
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:45,346
I'm hanging up for real.
Yeah, I'll talk to you later!

212
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,350
It's fine.

213
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,730
-Oh, the bus is here. Let's go.
-Oh, okay.

214
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:05,116
Oh, the friend from the call…

215
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:08,077
She was there that one time,
visiting home.

216
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:13,207
-Ohh.
-Her name is So-ra. She's a nurse.

217
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:16,252
She moved to my hospital.
She says she got into the ICU.

218
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,798
She tells me everything like that
all the time.

219
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:51,496
Sleep well.

220
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:53,664
Good night.

221
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:04,842
Tae-hee <i>ssi.</i>

222
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,223
Is something the matter?

223
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:40,753
Sleep well.

224
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,424
Good night.

225
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,527
Okay, okay.

226
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:37,310
<i>Oh, because Joon-ho told me</i>

227
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:41,063
<i>to ask a police officer</i>
<i>if I can't find the ring.</i>

-Yes?

230
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,336
-Have a good lunch.
-You too!

231
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:16,766
I told you not to come here.
Didn't I tell you to stay home?

232
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:20,394
But I'm hungry.
There's nothing to eat at home.

233
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:21,604
Oh…

234
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:37,078
-You're here to see your mom.
-Who are you?

235
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,705
Oh, I'm…

Ohh…

239
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:57,723
Then please buy me some <i>tteokbokki.</i>

240
00:25:58,766 --> 00:25:59,809
<i>Tteokbokki</i>?

242
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:07,024
-Why aren't you eating, E<i>onni</i>?
-Hm? I am eating.

243
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:09,277
Here.

244
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:14,240
Try dipping this in here.

245
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:25,251
-Wow, this is good. The cheese is so rich.
-Right?

246
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:34,135
Why <i>tteokbokki </i>though?
Don't you have it often with your friends?

247
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,430
I don't get allowances to.

248
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:42,560
It's okay. I don't have time to, anyways.
I have to practice dancing.

249
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,521
-Dance?
-I'm gonna become a K-pop star.

250
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:51,485
Welcome to A Dime A Job!

251
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:54,947
-You made it! Must have been a long trip.
-Nah, it was fine.

252
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,831
How've you been, my dear son?

253
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,712
Give me a hug, it's been a while.

254
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,724
What a tear-jerking mother-son reunion.

255
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:25,102
Hyang-bok, is this your office?

256
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:27,605
Yes. Office is here,
and residence at the back.

257
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:33,402
Hey, what's wrong
with your hair this time?

258
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:36,655
What do you have against my hair?
You jealous?

259
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:39,492
-Let's head in.
-Sure.

260
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:42,119
-That little…
-Let's go, Mom.

261
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:43,204
Okay.

262
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,380
Wow, so this is what this tastes like.

263
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:57,760
What should we do?
I better head inside soon.

264
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:03,724
Thank you for the meal, <i>Eonni.</i>
Can you keep this a secret from my mom?

265
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:07,561
You got it. Don't worry about it.

266
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:13,317
-Oh, <i>Eonni</i>.
-Yes?

267
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:15,319
What's your phone model?

268
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,530
-My phone?
-Yeah.

269
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:22,284
Hello. I'm Yoon Seol-a from Bongcheong
Elementary, third year, third class.

270
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:23,494
One second.

271
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:28,916
Hmm. Should we
tuck your hair behind your ears?

272
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,796
Nah, it was better before.
Let's try it again.

273
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:35,840
Please introduce yourself.

274
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:40,094
Hello. I'm Yoon Seol-a from Bongcheon
Elementary, third year, third class.

275
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:42,346
Yoon Seol-a <i>yang,</i>
why do you want to be a singer?

276
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:44,765
Um…

277
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:49,228
CANCER HOSPITAL
HEART AND BRAIN HOSPITAL

278
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:05,119
How dare you meet up with this
filthy undertaker when your baby is sick!

279
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,666
I'll take care of the baby.

280
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,627
Thank you, I'll only take a moment.

281
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:33,022
How do you dance so well, by the way?
Where'd you learn?

282
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,482
K-pop star fancams.

283
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:38,819
My classmates only get to watch if they
get a good grade on the English test

284
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:40,946
but my mom knows nothing other than money.

285
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:44,617
Money, money, money.
But still complains about not having any.

286
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:47,995
Is this your phone number?

287
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:51,332
Yeah. Call me if you need to
take videos of anything else.

288
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:52,958
I'll think about it.

289
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,629
We're here. I live right there.

290
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:00,841
Go ahead inside.

291
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,805
-Hey, <i>Eonni</i>.
-Yeah.

292
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:10,643
-I'm good at singing, too.
-Whoa, really?

293
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,354
I have to take a video
of the singing as well.

294
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,440
Can you help me with that, too?

295
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:23,864
Oh… But what do I do?
I have to head back to work for now.

296
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:28,244
Um… Would it be okay to
meet up next week again to do that?

297
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:32,122
I'd like that!
I should practice until then.

298
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,083
Thank you, <i>Eonni.</i>

299
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:36,252
Take care.

300
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:51,850
<i>Oh, because Joon-ho told me</i>

301
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,646
<i>to ask a police officer</i>
<i>if I can't find the ring.</i>

302
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,195
What's up?

303
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:19,837
By chance… Do you know of anyone that was
at Joon-ho's accident at the time?

304
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:23,591
-Who?
-Maybe like a police officer.

305
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:29,305
Hm… There must have been.

306
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:32,391
A first responder.

307
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:35,394
Right, first responder…

308
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:39,940
Why do you ask?

309
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,652
Just curious about the incident.

310
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:47,531
-Anything else from the investigation?
-Well…

311
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,327
You must know that
it was dark and had no passerby's

312
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:54,788
so they weren't transported
to the hospital right away.

313
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,460
You must also know that
a man living nearby reported it.

314
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:04,673
Also that he got caught at the scene
so there's nothing else to investigate.

315
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:12,014
-Is something wrong?
-Oh, no.

316

HANGEUL PROCLAMATION DAY
9

317
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:59,645
My goodness, until when do I have to
look after this idiot…

318
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:11,782
MAKE THIS FOR YOUR SISTER 
WHEN SHE GETS HERE.

319
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:42,479
Mom…

320
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,581
Wow.

321
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:02,374
Starting with handmade <i>mandu</i>

322
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,376
Mother prepared everything.

323
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,462
Everything you like. Right?

324
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:10,174
You saw, I didn't touch a single dumpling.

325
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:12,092
So please tell our mom that, <i>Noona</i>.

326
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,220
-Now then, shall we dig in?
-Yes.

327
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:17,473
Thank you for the meal.

328
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:33,030
You should have this.

329
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:43,123
What is this, conveyor belt sushi?!
Just serve yourselves!

330
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,085
Uncle.

331
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,130
Thank you, my nephew.

332
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:59,515
-Mm. The ribs are amazing.
-Are they?

333
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:12,528
<i>I…</i>

334
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:16,406
<i>I-I think I got top grade in the class.</i>

335
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:20,244
-First place in the police academy!
-Oh man! You did?

336
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:25,040
Top of the class are promised assignment
to the department of their choice…

337
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:28,961
Oh man, we're done struggling, <i>Hyeong.</i>
Good job!

338
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:33,090
I thought, for once in my life

339
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:39,471
something called "happiness" was coming.

340
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,933
I uh, can't let today go by.

341
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:47,396
-Hey, let's drink.
-I wish you would stop drinking

342
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:49,523
<i>and just get married.</i>

343
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:52,317
W<i>hat do I own that I</i>
<i>would find love and get married?</i>

344
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:55,487
I'm a mess with a rap sheet 
instead of a high school diploma,

345
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:58,740
<i>an alcoholic father</i>
<i>who kicked the bucket in prison,</i>

346
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:01,702
and a mom that was
on the news when she passed.

347
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,377
<i>I'm done for,</i>

348
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:12,754
so just worry about yourself.

349
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,092
Man, how are you our father's son?

350
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:20,762
Is there a mistake somewhere?

351
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:25,642
I think I'm also done for.

352
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,758
Are your parents here?

353
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:04,681
I bet they were very happy
to see you for the first time in a while.

354
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,146
It must have been two years.

355
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,909
A parent who have lost their child

356
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,331
are alive, but not alive at all.

357
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:36,672
Their insides empty, about to crumble away

358
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,466
even if they are alive, they are dead.

359
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:43,220
I…

360
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:51,436
I must have done that to my parents, too.

361
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:57,859
But even then,
just because I'm their child

362
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:06,743
they are so sorry that I am hurt.

363
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,374
Even though they're dead, themselves.

364
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:24,886
Compared to that

365
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:30,642
I'm really going through nothing.

366
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:33,061
I felt so terrible about that

367
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,526
I couldn't endure it.

368
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,660
You said, sorry
that you ran away, right?

369
00:38:57,836 --> 00:39:00,338
I couldn't even
keep him company on his way.

370
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,260
Neither could I keep my parents company.

<i>It's me that ran away.</i>

373
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:20,817
Do you know

374
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:24,696
what one hears the most
at a funeral?

375
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:28,366
"If you're alive, you should live."

376
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:35,791
I thought that was
such a cruel thing to say.

377
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:39,628
But

378
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:46,218
The Deceased's tell me the same thing.

379
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:50,972
To keep those left behind alive.

380
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:54,267
To make it less painful for them.

381
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:02,234
So…

382
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:08,323

385

and remember him.

386
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:28,468
People say that if someone is remembered

387
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:34,432
they are not completely gone,
even if they pass.

388
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,817

How come you're out in the cold?

392
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,507
I'm so full, I had to digest a bit.

393
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,803
It's great eating Mom's food
for the first time in so long.

394
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:17,559
I asked you to visit us so many times.
How could you not come once?

395
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:19,102
I'm sorry.

396
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,492
Mom.

397
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,161
Hm?

398
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:48,006
What's the occasion?
Holding your mom's hand like that.

399
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:51,343
Was my food that good?

400
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,310

Yeah, let's.

<i>It went well. I'm back now.</i>
<i>Thought you might be worried.</i>

It'll be a long trip
driving all the way down there again.

-Yes, we should.
-Oh, the bag.

Don't worry about me. Okay?

414
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:06,246
Come on, families aren't supposed to be
like this.

-Stop it, stop. Stop I say.

Where in <i>Yeosu?</i>

-G-Gwangmu District.

-Heading to work?
-Yes.

Wanted to give you this.

You should, uh, dress warmer.

436
00:46:57,565 --> 00:46:59,150
You'll catch cold like that.

437
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:06,491
What's with the silence?

438
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:08,701
Are you blown away?

439

We're dating.

Oh… It must have been you
that Dong-joo <i>ssi </i>likes.

Letting days go by without telling you

felt like a mistake to me.
That's why I'm telling you.

448
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:18,980
I bet you'll feel betrayed

Oh… Hello.

465
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:39,018
You know, back when I used to
get dispatched to ER every other day

466
00:49:39,102 --> 00:49:42,188
All other doctors
gave me the cold shoulder

467
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:44,273
but you alone were friendly to me.

468
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:45,900
I remember you.

469
00:49:47,527 --> 00:49:49,028
I heard the news.

470
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,864
That you left the hospital
after the incident.

471
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:56,369
I was assigned your brother's case.

472
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:58,746
What?

473
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:01,874
There was no time to say hi.

474
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:04,001
Your father came for statements

475
00:50:04,711 --> 00:50:07,505
I actually did see you at the ER that day.

476
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:10,007
You were probably not yourself.

477
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:13,052
-Did you by chance go to the site, too?
-The site?

478
00:50:13,261 --> 00:50:16,347
First responder was
dispatched from the police box. Why?

479
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:19,350
I'm wondering
if there were any words from them.

480
00:50:19,434 --> 00:50:23,730
When he got there, they were on their way
to the ER already despite the late report.

481
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:28,359
The bastard's still in hospital, right?

482
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:36,367
-Yes.
-Man, he better not die like that.

483
00:50:36,868 --> 00:50:39,162
Drunk drivers need to be punished hard.

484
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:40,830
If he dies…

485
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:47,170
-Will the case close?
-Yeah.

486
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:50,631
If he dies, it all ends.

487
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:08,900

-Excuse me.
-Yes.

Is it… Possible to
do the coffining at night?

491
00:52:21,264 --> 00:52:25,935
I mean, it's just… I think it'd be better
to get it over with sooner than later.

492
00:52:26,686 --> 00:52:29,856
I see. Well, I will take a look at
our schedule and let you know.

493
00:52:32,942 --> 00:52:34,110
And, uh…

494
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:40,908
If you could…
hide the marks…

495
00:52:42,577 --> 00:52:45,288
Of course. We will keep our eyes on them.

496
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:55,464

with Team Leader Seo.

-Alright.

00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:10,229

00:53:27,914 --> 00:53:29,624
Am I going to dance now?

503
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:36,631
Are you going to do my make-up?

504
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:46,807
Wow… These clothes are so pretty, too.

505
00:53:48,768 --> 00:53:51,979
See? I told you I'll only eat
a little bit of the tteokbokki.

506
00:53:52,188 --> 00:53:53,648
I probably gained weight…

507
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:56,525
Not at all. You're fine.

508
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,907
Is this really not a dream?

509
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:05,034
What if it is?

510
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:09,080
I fell asleep watching
the video you took of me.

511
00:54:10,623 --> 00:54:12,708
I'm afraid that this will be a dream.

512
00:54:18,506 --> 00:54:20,633
Because this place is so amazing.

513
00:54:21,968 --> 00:54:23,636

522
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:13,519
<i>Such is the most extreme case of</i>

523
00:55:15,146 --> 00:55:17,690
I'm… Dead, you say?

524
00:55:19,442 --> 00:55:21,777
-Seol-a…
-You're lying, right?

525
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:25,364
There's no way my mom would do that to me.
Why would she?

526
00:55:29,577 --> 00:55:31,078
I don't want to die.

527
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:34,915
I want to live.
Please let me live, E<i>onni.</i>

528
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:37,960
You promised to 
take video of me singing.

529
00:55:39,754 --> 00:55:41,088
I'm sorry, Seol-a.

530
00:55:45,134 --> 00:55:46,635
I don't want to die.

531
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:49,847
I want to try dyeing my hair,

532
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:52,349
fly on an airplane,

533
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:55,144
have a boyfriend,

534
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:58,481
Uh, drink Boba tea one more time…

535
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,818
I have so many things I want to do, E<i>onni.</i>

536
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:07,782
I don't care if I'm poor,
I don't care if I'm hungry.

537
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:14,622
Please save me, <i>Eonni.</i>

538
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:19,502
Please, save me and my mom, <i>Eonni…</i>

539
00:57:11,804 --> 00:57:12,805
Huh?

540
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:22,064
Why…

541
00:57:37,872 --> 00:57:39,290
I just can't believe it…

542
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:43,169
How could she do that? Her own daughter…

543
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:48,174
I was gonna make her pay
when she woke up. I was--

544
00:57:48,257 --> 00:57:51,135
-gonna slap her or something, but--
-Is that enough for you?

545
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:52,636
But she didn't wake up.

546
00:57:54,346 --> 00:57:58,809
It wasn't like the last time where someone
suddenly came in or I left the room

547
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:01,979
but she didn't wake up.
Why, I wonder?

548
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:03,522
Hm…

549
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:08,068
Maybe she didn't deserve the gift.

550
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:10,446
You once said a deceased told you,

551
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:13,365
that having met you, Stella, is a miracle.

552
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:17,912
But that mother
has committed two big crimes.

553
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:22,416
She took her daughter's life,
and ended her own.

554
00:58:23,209 --> 00:58:27,087
Just because she is her mother, no,
under any circumstance,

555
00:58:27,922 --> 00:58:32,384
taking one's life is a huge sin,
and to live one's life is not a choice.

556
00:58:32,885 --> 00:58:36,597
She does not deserve the
big blessing of meeting Stella.

557
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:39,767
Is it a blessing?

558
00:58:42,478 --> 00:58:47,608
For Seol-a…
Was it a blessing to have met me?

559
00:58:48,943 --> 00:58:51,570
There was nothing I could do for her.

560
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:58,869
On that day, she asked me
to take a video of her singing.

561
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:00,955
I should have…

562
00:59:06,627 --> 00:59:10,047
It's not like I can revive a dead person.
What's the point?

563
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:12,549
-Who is it a blessing to?
-Stella.

564
00:59:13,092 --> 00:59:15,344
I couldn't do anything for Joon-ho.

565
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:18,597
"Don't be afraid.

566
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:24,979
Tell me anything, everything you want to
say, then I'll… deliver it all."

567
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:30,276
That's all I can ever say or do…

568
00:59:32,945 --> 00:59:34,822
I couldn't even do that for him.

569
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:37,866
You found and delivered
the ring in the end.

570
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:38,951
If I…

571
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:44,081
listened to, even one more word from
Joon-ho instead of running away that day…

572
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:50,212
I would have had
something to deliver to Tae-hee <i>ssi…</i>

573
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:57,219
The person I love is in so much pain,

574
01:00:00,431 --> 01:00:02,641
and there's nothing I can do about it.

575
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,773
Could someone like me…

576
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:16,739
Be a blessing,
and a miracle to someone else, Father?

"Forever?"

588
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:43,575
<i>Yes. People say dances last forever.</i>

<i>Things like that are said to last forever,</i>
