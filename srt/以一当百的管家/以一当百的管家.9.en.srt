1
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,252
{\an8}CLOSED DUE TO PERSONAL BUSINESS

2
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,426
{\an8}Is the boss's daughter at the hospital?

3
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,596
{\an8}Are you the Bang Jeong-hwan of Bongsu?

4
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,474
{\an8}You seem to care a lot about children.

5
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:58,893
Especially with that bully.

6
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,395
Why do you sympathize so much with them?

7
00:01:02,188 --> 00:01:03,522
Do I really?

8
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,358
You feel for them too much.

9
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:09,111
Maybe it's time to get some of your own.

10
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,071
You should get married.

11
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:12,406
Goodness.

12
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:17,787
That is my dream though.
To be the father of a harmonious family.

13
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:19,872
Jeez.

14
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:29,548
They kicked everyone out.

15
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:32,134
I wonder when
the redevelopment will start.

16
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:34,220
Seriously.

17
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:00,454
Please save me.

18
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:38,701
Are you giving this to Chung-ha?

19
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:40,870
Yes.

20
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:49,879
<i>-Only if...</i>
-Hello?

21
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:53,173
I'll be right there.

22
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:54,884
Yes, sir.

23
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,388
<i>I hadn't left in a hurry that day...</i>

24
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,558
<i>We're really going to go see the stars?</i>
<i>You're serious, right?</i>

25
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:03,642
Yes.

26
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,520
Come to Bongsu market with that ring.

27
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,564
I'll be there by 8 o'clock.

28
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:12,985
Okay.

29
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,656
Jeez. He really likes the stars.

30
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:21,994
How adorable.

31
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,245
<i>Only if I hadn't made that promise...</i>

32
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:24,538
PROFESSOR PARK YONG

33
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:26,415
Yes, professor.

34
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,168
Okay, I'll be right there.

35
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,631
BROTHER

36
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:39,929
Wow. Lecture at
the fall academic conference.

37
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:43,349
The chairman selected you specifically.

38
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,186
-I'll do my best to prepare.
-Okay.

39
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,396
The topic will be decided gradually.

40
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,817
Email me all your research first.

41
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,152
Yes, sir.

42
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,864
<i>Only if I had answered</i>
<i>his last phone call.</i>

43
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:21,971
Joon-ho, I'm on my way.

44
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,943
It was already late when I had arrived.

45
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,615
There was nothing I could've done.

46
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:46,787
I miss him.

47
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:51,041
I just wish...

48
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:54,420
I want to see him just once.

49
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,506
If you meet you brother,

50
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,843
what do you want to tell him the most?

51
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,141
That I'm sorry.

52
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,394
That everything is my fault.

53
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,651
He probably resents me a lot.

54
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,698
After I started this job,

55
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:27,453
there was only one time I met a kid.

56
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,248
You met a kid before?

57
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:32,916
Yes.

58
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,670
I have to go.

59
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,383
The ring. I left the ring
in front of Bongsu market.

60
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,637
He was a worried child.

61
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:49,475
He cared for people other than himself.

62
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:51,894
He was that kind of a kid.

63
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,613
I didn't know then,

64
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,241
but now that I think about it,

65
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:10,954
it hurts.

66
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:17,002
Like that child, I'm sure
your brother won't resent you.

67
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:21,840
Because it's not your fault.

68
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:26,970
Don't blame yourself.

69
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:40,901
If you were there.

70
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:52,913
If you were there besides me,
it would've been better.

71
00:06:58,127 --> 00:06:59,128
Thank you...

72
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:05,425
for being next to me now.

73
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:27,281
THE LETTER THAT I CAN'T SEND

74
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:03,942
LOBBY

75
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:25,964
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

76
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,768
I was going to pull an all-nighter.

77
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,651
I wanted to keep watching.

78
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,037
Joseph.

79
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,456
Get up real quick.

80
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:09,967
This right here.

81
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,470
Give your strength to it.

82
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,847
-Why?
-Hurry.

83
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,185
More.

84
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,312
More.

85
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,692
Give your strength to it.

86
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,987
And you can be sad.

87
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:32,447
You don't have to hold it in.

88
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:34,283
When you miss your dad,

89
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,327
you can say you miss him.

90
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,664
And you're allowed to cry.

91
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,043
You can cry like you did yesterday.

92
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,004
Okay?

93
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,017
Joseph, say "Ee."

94
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,353
Let me see if your tooth came out.

95
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:07,607
Where are you going? Come here.

96
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:09,735
Let me see your teeth.

97
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,863
You're not going to show me?

98
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:18,368
Show me.

99
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,454
Hurry and show me your teeth.

100
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,080
Come on.

101
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,208
You're so heavy.

102
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,502
What did you eat?

103
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:31,173
You ate something
while we were sleeping, huh?

104
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:33,842
Joseph, did you sleep well?

105
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,263
You're awake.

106
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,266
-Did you have a good night sleep?
-Yes.

107
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,353
When did you cook all this?

108
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,355
I woke up early.

109
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,483
I thought you'd be hungry.

110
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,109
I woke up early.

111
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,529
Who eats meat for breakfast?

112
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,789
-That looks delicious.
-That looks delicious.

113
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:04,873
Here.

114
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,250
Let's dig in.

115
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,545
Joseph, say "ah."

116
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,673
How is it? It's good, right?

117
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,806
Michelin can't compare, right?

118
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:24,017
I haven't been to one, so I don't know.

119
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,645
I admit you're good at grilling.

120
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,819
Oh, yeah. I woke up early today

121
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:38,448
and looked around this place.
People here...

122
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,118
They stay here for at least two nights.

123
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,413
Maybe to get their money's worth...

124
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,705
I see.

125
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:46,915
Is that so?

126
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:49,709
Joseph.

127
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,045
Should we stay another night?

128
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:55,298
Didn't you say you want
to see the stars more?

129
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,883
You did?

130
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:58,677
Shall we?

131
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,929
We can fish and swim too.

132
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:04,141
-And we have so much food left.
-That's right.

133
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,436
No, I have to go see my mom.

134
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:10,772
-I see.
-I see.

135
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,816
Sure.

136
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:14,526
Okay.

137
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:17,404
That's a waste, right?

138
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:18,989
Yes, it is.

139
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:20,782
Eat more meat.

140
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:24,035
Be careful.

141
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:31,001
-Joseph, should we see flowers?
-Yes.

142
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,670
Have you seen this many flowers?

143
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:38,258
There's so much over there and here too.

144
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,483

00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:55,567

Joseph.

147
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,575
Use this.

148
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,998
This will help you
find your dad faster at the playground.

149
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,667
Thank you.

150
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:15,587
How adorable.

151
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,342
Is there anything you like, Dong-joo?

152
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,636
Yes, try this on.

Joseph, did you have fun?

156
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,642
-Yes, I had so much fun.
-That's good.

157
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:14,437
Good job. It must've been exhausting.

158
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:15,730
No. Not at all.

159
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:17,440
We had fun too.

160
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:19,317
Right.

161
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:22,988
Joseph lost a tooth.

162
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,615
Wow, Joseph, you lost a tooth?

163
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,325
-Yes!
-That's amazing.

164
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,786
-Let's brag to mom when she comes.
-Okay.

165
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:31,496
Okay, she's here.

166
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,164
Mom!

167
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,209
-Did you have fun?
-Yes.

168
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,380
Dong-joo and Tae-hee showed me
the stars and bought me this.

169
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:41,464
That's good.

170
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:43,967
Hello.

171
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,761
I don't know how to thank you two.

172
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:50,056
It must've been tiring
taking care of a young boy.

173
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,182
No, ma'am.

174
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:54,311
He's so kind and listens very well.

175
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:56,646
Mom, were you scared?

176
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,733
-Why would I be?
-Because you were alone at night.

177
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:03,069
He cares for you a lot.

178
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,239
You do? I wasn't scared at all.

179
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:08,825
Is that right?

180
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,744
Then, I should've called you.

181
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:14,205
Dong-joo and Tae-hee wanted
to stay for another night.

182
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,333
They begged.

183
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,834
They did?

184
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,090
Right. Here.

185
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:25,925

You did a great job.

188
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:47,781
I had fun, thanks to you.

189
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:49,616
Me too.

190
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,287
And thank you

191
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:56,956
for a lot of things.

192
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:00,919
Thank you, too,

193
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,380
for telling me.

194
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:08,551
Also,

195
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:13,348
if you don't have anyone to talk to,
you can always come to me.

196
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,892
It's better to let things out.

197
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,396
So come to me when you feel frustrated.

198
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,314
I'm here for you now.

199
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,735
My lips are sealed.

200
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:34,536
Would you like to have dinner with me?

201
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,585
-Are you down for chi-maek?
-Well...

202
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:46,923
That scared me!

203
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,304
-What are you doing? Come in.
-Hello.

204
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,931
I'm coming!

205
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:57,809
You scared me.

206
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,813
Father called to go together.

207
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,984
She was good with the kid.

208
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:07,861
Also, with the tent.

209
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,904
There's nothing she can't do.

210
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:15,535
I see.

211
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,957
That's why you're so happy.

212
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,001
-What?
-Goodness.

213
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,381
Hey,

214
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,801
I never saw you smile like that.

215
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:36,473
You're always frowning at me,
so I almost forgot.

216
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,099
But...

217
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:41,936
I wonder who turned my nephew into this.

218
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:43,980
Could it be Baek Dong-joo?

219
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,274
What are you saying?

220
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:47,942
It's not like that.

221
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,073
Damn it. I should've gone.

222
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:56,409
It seems like it was fun.

223
00:17:57,786 --> 00:18:01,748
Seeing other people having fun
makes me jealous.

224
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,334
Even if it's my nephew.

225
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,418
Jeez.

226
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,212
Goodness, my stomach.

227
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,881
How much did you drink
to be this hungover?

228
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,469
My hangovers last
for 48 hours now that I'm old.

229
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,554
Who did you drink with?

230
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,935
-What?
-You didn't even go camping.

231
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,603
You were excited to go.

232
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:26,147
I'm sure it's not just anyone.

233
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,069
-Myeong-chul.
-What?

234
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,405
He recently broke up with his girlfriend.

235
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,282
He was having a hard time.

236
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:40,453
He's was looking for a way
to get back together or whatever...

237
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,580
But why would he ask you?

238
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,374
Seriously, I don't know.

239
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:47,961
But...

240
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:50,672
What would you tell him?

241
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:52,423
What would you do?

242
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,428
If it's over, what could I do?

243
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,139
Right.

244
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,772
-Clean up the rest.
-What?

245
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,484
That jerk... You clean it up!

246
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:22,453
<i>Dong-joo, I was worried,</i>
<i>but it looks like you had a lot of fun.</i>

247
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,839
<i>One night, two days.</i>

248
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:34,799
<i>-Next time,</i>
-Send it at once.

249
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,009
<i>Two nights, three days!</i>

250
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,517
<i>Good night.</i>

251
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:13,504
What are you doing alone
in the middle of the night?

252
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:16,883
You're here.

253
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:26,517
Hey, you have a headache everyday.

254
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:31,606
Hold up.

255
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,321
Here.

256
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:44,911
What is this?

257
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:49,207
Are you doing this to make me feel weak?

258
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,541
What do you mean?

259
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,168
I was actually

260
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,463
going to live here temporarily

261
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,841
and move to the famous Gang-nam.

262
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,551
And?

263
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,472
But you're taking such good care of me.

264
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:06,683
I want to be with you.

265
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,394
And settle down in this
A Dime A Job house.

266
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,771
Jeez. Don't say something so scary.

267
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:19,404
Don't you know how good it is
to eat here with you guys?

268
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:21,155
I feel like I have a real family.

269
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:23,116
I feel like I received

270
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,785
a Christmas gift I've never gotten before.

271
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,497
Also...

272
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,291
with Dong-joo too!

273
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:35,753
Tae-hee.

274
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,130
I

275
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:39,632
really like Dong-joo.

276
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:42,468
I can't even swim,

277
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:45,346
but I'm drowning in Dongju's eyes.

278
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,766
Her cute walk.

279
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,227
And her cool personality.

280
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,603
-Hurry and sleep.
-And...

281
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,439
Jeez. You're the one driving.

282
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,149
Especially, when she smiles,

283
00:21:56,774 --> 00:22:00,111
she's so beautiful.

284
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:04,323
There's not a single thing she lacks.

285
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:06,617
I'm probably...

286
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:10,580
in love with her.

287
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,959
-In love?
-Yes.

288
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:17,628
Love is a cure for everything, isn't it?

289
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:20,965
Even when I have a bad headache,

290
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:23,885
it goes away as soon as I see Dong-joo.

291
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:26,220
If that isn't love, then what is?

292
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:27,722
I'm sure it's love.

293
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:38,566
Why aren't you dating? You're so handsome.

294
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:41,778
-What?
-Are you just not interested?

295
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:45,281
Or are you against it or something?

296
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,034
You didn't take your medicine.
Hurry and take it.

297
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:51,662
Talking too much
isn't good for your headache.

298
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:54,665
I did talk a lot, didn't I?

299
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:09,222
<i>Love is a cure for everything, isn't it?</i>

300
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,975
<i>Even when I have a bad headache,</i>

301
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,561
<i>it goes away as soon as I see Dong-joo.</i>

302
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,606
<i>If that isn't love, then what is?</i>

303
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:19,690
<i>I'm sure it's love.</i>

304
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:53,891
Jeez.

305
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:15,580
-Off to work?
-Yes.

306
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,834
Good choice. I'd rather be at work
on a summer day like this.

307
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:24,172
But I don't know why the air conditioner
at home isn't cooler than the one at work.

308
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,341
Isn't that because
you keep turning it on and off?

309
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:29,427
You're right. How smart.

310
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:35,016
-How pretty. It's grown so much.
-Vincent.

311
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:36,309
Yes, are you leaving?

312
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:45,693
Dong-joo, where are you going?

313
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:46,986
I'm going to work.

314
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:48,696
I see.

315
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,157
Let's go together. I'll drop you off.

316
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,410
-Isn't that going too far?
-No, it's not.

317
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:55,661
It's on the way.

318
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,080
Let's go.

319
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,251
-Drive safely.
-Okay.

320
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:17,516
Did you rest yesterday?

321
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:19,143
Yes.

322
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,104
Right.

323
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:25,191
I'll put this here.

324
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,026
What is it?

325
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:28,110
Vitamins.

326
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:32,114
I got canker sores on my tongue
and I got better after taking these.

327
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:36,494
Thank you.

328
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:38,829
Take some later.

329
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:40,915
Okay.

330
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:53,970
Thank you.

331
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:00,768
Drive safely.

332
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:04,355
-I'll get going.
-Okay, go first.

333
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:06,482
Okay.

334
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:27,753
LET'S OBEY THE STOP SIGN

335
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:38,973
You're Tae-hee, right?

336
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:45,146
Who is it?

337
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:56,032
It was worth seeing.

338
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:58,576
Jeez. How pathetic.

339
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:07,668
Hey.

340
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:09,712
Go take a look yourself.

341
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,089
You'd get rid of your feelings.

342
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:14,967
Who does he think he is?

343
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,094
How rude too.

344
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,473
How dare he just nod?

345
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:21,766
That's enough.

346
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:27,021
You don't think you're pathetic yourself?

347
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,567
What feelings do you have left
for someone like him?

348
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:39,075
You look like someone who's suffering.

349
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,786
But he looked like
he was having a great time.

350
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:43,954
Does he have a girlfriend?

351
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,214
Do you think he's like you?

352
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:55,674
He does have a girlfriend, doesn't he?

353
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:57,802
That son of a bitch.

354
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:02,056
-That bastard--
-No, it's not like that!

355
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:04,809
Leave please.

356
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:06,811
Just leave.

357
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:08,312
It's better that way.

358
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:11,148
Everyone seems to be good at leaving me.
Why can't you?

359
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:13,901
Why are you chasing me around
and making me miserable?

360
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:15,444
Chung-ha.

361
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,240
I'm your mother.
Do you think I'm the same as that jerk?

362
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:21,575
Do you think I'm the same
as that bastard who blames a woman

363
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,369
for the death of his younger brother?

364
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:25,871
Just choose one!

365
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:30,167
Why does a woman
who's crazy about men need maternal love?

366
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:32,420
Or a woman dragging a man into her house
where her daughter lives?

367
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:33,879
Or a woman who's crazy over men?

368
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:11,125
A DIME A JOB

369
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:21,427
What are you looking at?

370
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,387
Oh my God!

371
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,098
You scared me!

372
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:28,726
-You get scared so easily.
-That scared me.

373
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:31,270
Why did you leave work so early today?

374
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,938
Well...

375
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:36,775
the team leader wanted to ditch work.

376
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,611
Really?

377
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,321
I've never seen such a boss.

378
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:42,490
He's so cool.

379
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:43,824
Your boss is cool too.

380
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:45,743
You don't know him.

381
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:51,415
Did you have dinner yet?

382
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:53,751
No, not yet.

383
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:56,879
Then,

384
00:29:57,213 --> 00:30:00,090
shall we have dinner tonight?

385
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:27,409
I'll be here for a few days.

386
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:36,794
What are you doing?

387
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:38,504
Don't say no.

388
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:40,506
You know you met my mom.

389
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:40,107
I won't be here long.

390
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,859
Just until I find a house.

391
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:43,861
I'll sleep in the hospital when I can.

392
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:46,822
But I feel bad for you. What do I do?

393
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:48,574
No, I--

394
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:49,658
Go to a hotel.

395
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,121
I'll leave in a few days.

396
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:57,916
Yes, man.

397
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:01,170
How can you send a woman
to a hotel this late at night?

398
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,298
-Do you want to use my room?
-Living room is fine.

399
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:07,092
-Jeez. The living room--
-Just stay in my room.

400
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,308
His room is clean.

401
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:31,617
Kim Tae-hee.

402
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:34,953
Where are you going?

403
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:42,252
Chung-ha.

404
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:46,548
It's over between us.

405
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:52,971
It's over.

406
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:54,264
No.

407
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,475
How can we just end it?

408
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,644
We dated for ten years.

409
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:01,730
Your smell, your behavior,
your way of speaking, your habit...

410
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:03,357
I didn't forget any of it.

411
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:05,943
Have you already forgotten?

412
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,612
Is it that easy for you to end it?

413
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,036
Do you still

414
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,123
hate me that much?

415
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,126
Can't you forgive me?

416
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,927
This patient has
a 55% better oxygen saturation,

417
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,721
so he is wearing a high flow.

418
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:35,639
He'll be moved to the ward later,

419
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:37,599
-so check later.
-Yes, ma'am.

420
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:39,435
That's it.

421
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,021
I heard you're going
someplace nice with doctor Tae-hee later.

422
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:45,607
Sky lounge.

423
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:49,361
How did you meet again after ten years?
It's impressive.

424
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,363
Well...

425
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,325
Maybe, fate?

426
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:56,994
Goodness.

427
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:02,124
-Take it easy.
-Okay, take care.

428
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,500
-I'll get going.
-Okay.

429
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:10,299
Hi, this is
Eonju University Hospital emergency room.

430
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:16,722
-Doctor.
-A 38-year-old male.

431
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:19,016
He's in a state of mental change
after suffering a head trauma.

432
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,476
And a boy,
estimated to be under 10 years old,

433
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:24,021
has abdominal trauma, multiple trauma,
and the vitals are said to be unstable.

434
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:26,106
-Call Tak Chung-ha.
-Yes, sir.

435
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:37,576
-TA patient?
-Yes.

436
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:38,869
The patient was the driver.

437
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:40,204
He's currently unconscious.

438
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:43,874
Saturation continues to fall,
suggesting a cervical spine injury.

439
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,626
Move him
to the treatment room immediately.

440
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:02,684
Move. One, two, three. Shoot!

441
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:05,979
-Give me LP and Altro.
-I'll prepare it.

442
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:15,864
Does he have a pulse?

443
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:17,533
No, not yet.

444
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:19,993
-It's ready.
-Good.

445
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:33,799
Joon-ho.

446
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:38,595
Joon-ho.

447
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:41,265
Joon-ho!

448
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,018
-Tae-hee, let's stop.
-Hold on.

449
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:51,191
Why isn't anyone doing anything?

450
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,111
Can someone please help? Please.

451
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:57,155
Please help me!

452
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:36,570
What about now?

453
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:38,530
-I can't do it myself.
-What about the CT room?

454
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:39,907
-It's ready.
-Let's go.

455
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,123
October 5, 2020

456
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:49,917
at 20:18,

457
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,669
patient Kim Joon-ho has died.

458
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:05,724
Doctor.

459
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,809
How is the driver's condition?

460
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:11,605
He's passed the dangerous part,
but I think we need to keep an eye on him.

461
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,273
I see, okay.

462
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:19,821
Joon-ho.

463
00:37:21,365 --> 00:37:22,532
Joon-ho.

464
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:31,875
Joon-ho.

465
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:34,878
<i>Was the child in the accident</i>
<i>Tae-hee's younger brother?</i>

466
00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:37,339
<i>That's right. How sad.</i>

467
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:00,862
No.

468
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:04,282
It's not a matter of forgiving or hating.

469
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,660
You did your job as a doctor.

470
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:09,037
I would've done the same if I were you.

471
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,791
So there's no need
for you to feel any guilt

472
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:14,751
or be sorry.

473
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:21,758
-It's my problem.
-"My problem..."

474
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:24,553
What is your problem exactly?

475
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,437
What else

476
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:35,814
do I not know?

477
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:45,991
If it's not my fault,

478
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:49,077
we don't need to break up.

479
00:38:58,253 --> 00:38:59,296
I'll wait

480
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:02,674
until you're okay.

481
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:04,926
No matter how long it takes. I'll wait.

482
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:10,098
Don't wait for me.

483
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:13,477
I'm never coming back.

484
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,190
Just because we're over,

485
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:21,026
doesn't mean it never happened.

486
00:39:57,646 --> 00:39:58,688
It's cold.

487
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:07,572
Why do I make people so pitiful?

488
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:11,034
Why do I make a sad person

489
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,954
more sad?

490
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:19,584
What about you?

491
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:23,505
Aren't you sad too?

492
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:24,923
Why would I be?

493
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:27,551
Hey.

494
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:30,595
Keeping your mouth shut
doesn't mean it's wise.

495
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:33,390
Chung-ha doesn't know yet, does she?

496
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:34,850
That happened

497
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:37,811
when Joon-ho came out
with the ring that day.

498
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,400
Just go and tell Chung-ha.

499
00:40:43,817 --> 00:40:46,111
Seeing Chung-ha coming home like that--

500
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:47,529
But that's my fault.

501
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:00,542
I don't want to blame Chung-ha.

502
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:09,301
I feel sorry for you the most.

503
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:11,052
You live like you're trapped somewhere.

504
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:14,472
I feel most pity for you
keeping everything inside.

505
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,644
<i>Let's have dinner next time.</i>

506
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,438
<i>You don't have to worry about me.</i>

507
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:05,732
<i>Good night.</i>

508
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:11,404
GOOD NIGHT

509
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,511
KIM TAE-HEE

510
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:47,148
STOP BY

511
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:53,071
Do you know
when I was most happy recently?

512
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:57,075
It's the day you went camping with Joseph.

513
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,121
I sent you because you wanted to go,

514
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:02,956
but I was extremely worried.

515
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,001
He's the same age as Joon-ho.

516
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:10,171
I was afraid you might feel
uncomfortable and upset.

517
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:13,300
You came back with a smile.

518
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:16,052
And that made me happy too.

519
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:20,473
I heard from Father
that the three of you had a lot of fun.

520
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:21,975
And you even saw the stars.

521
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:27,939
So I thought...

522
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:33,862
As much as a tortoise
or as much as a chest of drawers,

523
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,948
you've started to move.

524
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:43,538
And that you're slowly getting better.

525
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,380
I shouldn't be though, right?

526
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:55,342
What? What do you mean?

527
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:58,803
I shouldn't be getting better.

528
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:05,060
Forgetting all my mistakes
and feeling comfortable...

529
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,899
I shouldn't want to be happy.

530
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:14,235
You should, okay?

531
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:16,071
You should be happy.

532
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:20,325
You've been living with your arms
and legs shackled since that day.

533
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:24,162
But you'll really die then.

534
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,623
I'm alive and well though,

535
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:34,172
after making everyone miserable.

536
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,096
I'm afraid...

537
00:44:43,098 --> 00:44:45,392
that I might feel at ease
without even knowing it.

538
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,358
That's what I'm afraid of.

539
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:22,053
Dal-shik!

540
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:25,515
-How have you been?
-Good.

541
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:26,766
What's this?

542
00:45:27,267 --> 00:45:28,393
Something you like.

543
00:45:30,854 --> 00:45:32,147
It's hot though.

544
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,941
Exactly. I know you like it.

545
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:38,987
You should've told me
to come and take it. It's heavy.

546
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:42,532
-Bong.
-Yes.

547
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:48,705
It was around this time when Dong-joo
lost her mind over that job, right?

548
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:51,124
Yes. What about it?

549
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:53,501
I feel anxious.

550
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,087
Is there something going on with Dong-joo?

551
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:58,339
-Do you know?
-Me?

552
00:45:59,007 --> 00:46:01,217
Jeez. I barely even see her.

553
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:03,678
Why don't you call her?

554
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:07,098
She's probably busy with her studies.

555
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,225
Pray for her.

556
00:46:09,893 --> 00:46:12,395
So she doesn't get tired of studying

557
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:14,189
and pass the exam.

558
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:16,274
Dal-shik.

559
00:46:17,192 --> 00:46:18,234
You're Buddhist.

560
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,779
You don't believe in God.
You believe in Buddha.

561
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:23,156
Just do it.

562
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:25,158
Should I bow 108 times?

563
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:32,207
Why don't you visit Dong-joo
in her new home.

564
00:46:32,499 --> 00:46:36,294
She'll go crazy if I go
saying I'm watching her.

565
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:39,297
-Should I visit?
-Yes.

566
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,424
Never mind. She'll freak out.

567
00:46:49,933 --> 00:46:52,143
COME SLEEP AT HOME TODAY

568
00:46:56,773 --> 00:46:59,192
-Hello.
-Hello.

569
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:03,154
Are you going to work?

570
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:18,545
You didn't have to do this.

571
00:47:19,254 --> 00:47:21,005
I'm more comfortable walking.

572
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:22,799
It's hot today.

573
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:31,182
-Tae-hee's a good person, isn't he?
-What?

574
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:35,687
He's nice to everyone.

575
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:40,525
How long is your lease?

576
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:44,320
I need a house close to the hospital,
and it seems to be just right.

577
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:48,032
-Until the Fall.
-What?

578
00:47:48,575 --> 00:47:51,661
Really? I should be on standby.

579
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,877
<i>Hello, this is Restaurant Lubrio.</i>

580
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:02,547
<i>-I'd like to confirm your reservation.</i>
-Sure.

581
00:48:03,006 --> 00:48:06,801
<i>Reservation for two under the name</i>
<i>Kim Tae-hee on August 26th.</i>

582
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:09,512
-That's correct.
<i>-Thank you for confirming.</i>

583
00:48:09,596 --> 00:48:10,680
<i>Have a great day.</i>

584
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,059
I'm here to get back together
with Kim Tae-hee.

585
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,398
We've dated for ten years.

586
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,340
<i>Tomorrow at 7pm, Lubrio.</i>

587
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:47,634
<i>The reservation is under your name.</i>

588
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:51,220
<i>You told me not to wait.</i>

589
00:48:52,055 --> 00:48:54,015
<i>But I'll wait anyway.</i>

590
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:56,893
<i>I'm going to do everything I can.</i>

591
00:48:56,976 --> 00:48:58,436
<i>I'm going to try my best.</i>

592
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,378
Hello, sir!

593
00:49:23,795 --> 00:49:25,713
Yes, hello.

594
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:30,843
I couldn't make it on Bok-nal.
I thought you'd need some tonicking.

595
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:33,221
So-ra, if you keep doing this...

596
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:35,390
You remember my name.

597
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:37,642
This helps calm your nerves.

598
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:40,478
You really can't keep doing this.

599
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,730
I'm going to keep doing this.

600
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:45,191
This is heavy. Bon appetite.

601
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:46,693
Hey.

602
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:55,076
Jeez. Gomtang and now this...

603
00:49:59,372 --> 00:50:00,373
Yoo So-ra.

604
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:02,500
What are you doing?

605
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:06,379
-What are you up to?
-Nothing.

606
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:09,215
-Are you insane?
-No, I'm not.

607
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:12,093
No, you can't, okay?

608
00:50:12,385 --> 00:50:13,594
Why?

609
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:16,264
-I can't even like someone freely?
-Listen.

610
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:19,100
He dated his ex-girlfriend
for a long time--

611
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:20,893
I like a guy with a past.

612
00:50:20,977 --> 00:50:23,271
They dated for 20 years.

613
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:26,691
-He's so pure.
-His first love is back.

614
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:31,446
I'm finally going
to be in a love triangle.

615
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:33,406
Hey! Why can't you understand?

616
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:37,535
She married another man,
had a child, and then reappeared!

617
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:39,579
That's how serious their relationship is.

618
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:43,082
Our team leader is having
a hard time because of that,

619
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:44,375
and it's complicated.

620
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:46,502
I see.

621
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:48,379
Right?

622
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:50,715
It's not where you belong.

623
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:52,425
What's wrong with you?

624
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:54,969
Why are you so angry?

625
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:06,063
Don't do something that will hurt you.

626
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:09,817
Do you think our team leader
will like you? No, never.

627
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:12,653
They're deeply involved with each other.

628
00:51:13,446 --> 00:51:16,240
So don't do anything useless.

629
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:22,747
EONJU UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL FUNERAL HOME

630
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:51,943
Seo-rin.

631
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:55,154
I'm sorry...

632
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:03,871
for not being able
to raise you more healthy.

633
00:52:10,545 --> 00:52:11,546
I...

634
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:14,465
am sorry.

635
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:20,638
Don't be sick there.

636
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:23,057
I...

637
00:52:27,103 --> 00:52:28,104
love you.

638
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:33,484
Goodness. This is amazing.

639
00:52:45,955 --> 00:52:46,956
I'm pretty, aren't I?

640
00:52:50,543 --> 00:52:51,586
Why are you staring?

641
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:53,337
Am I pitiful?

642
00:52:54,964 --> 00:52:56,090
You don't have to be.

643
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:58,634
I'm good right now.

644
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:06,517
I'm going to grow out my hair
all the way to here.

645
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:10,313
Jeez. I was really sick of losing my hair

646
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:11,731
and wearing a wig.

647
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:15,359
And why are there
so many things I can't eat?

648
00:53:15,735 --> 00:53:18,988
You don't know how painful the
bone marrow injection is, do you?

649
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:21,991
Now that I don't have
to be sick, I feel alive.

650
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:29,874
I can kiss the hospital instead of school
and health room instead of class goodbye.

651
00:53:32,168 --> 00:53:36,881
Being stuck in the hallway alone without
a friend to go to the bathroom with...

652
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:40,426
Guarding the classroom
like an idiot during gym...

653
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:42,386
I don't need to do all that now.

654
00:53:44,305 --> 00:53:45,848
Best of all,

655
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:55,316
my parents don't need
to worry about my hospital bills anymore.

656
00:53:57,902 --> 00:54:01,364
My dad quit his job as a firefighter

657
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:03,574
in order to take care
of me in the hospital.

658
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,328
He cried everyday,

659
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:11,415
and worried about hospital bills.

660
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:15,127
He doesn't need to anymore.

661
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:19,799
I hope my parents

662
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:22,718
live more comfortably now.

663
00:54:33,688 --> 00:54:34,981
Then,

664
00:54:35,523 --> 00:54:38,526
there's nothing you want to ask me?

665
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:46,951
I'm fine.

666
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:49,328
Everything's fine,

667
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:53,666
but there is one thing I regret.

668
00:54:56,836 --> 00:54:57,837
Sixteen.

669
00:54:58,879 --> 00:54:59,880
What?

670
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:02,299
That's the locker number

671
00:55:04,677 --> 00:55:06,387
of the guy I like.

672
00:55:08,264 --> 00:55:10,057
Tae-hyung's locker number!

673
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:15,896
BAEK MOK HIGH SCHOOL

674
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,113
<i>My locker number is</i>

675
00:55:24,864 --> 00:55:26,240
<i>52.</i>

676
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:30,870
<i>There should be a letter inside.</i>

677
00:55:31,704 --> 00:55:35,041
<i>Can you put that in Tae-hyung's locker?</i>

678
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,461
LOVE PARK SEO-RIN

679
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,010
<i>Hello, Tae-hyung.</i>

680
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:32,598
<i>I don't know if you were surprised</i>

681
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:35,226
<i>by the sudden letter</i>
<i>from someone you don't even know.</i>

682
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:39,355
<i>My name is Park Seo-rin,</i>
<i>freshman in class 2.</i>

683
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:43,901
<i>Even if I introduce myself,</i>
<i>of course, you wouldn't know.</i>

684
00:56:45,194 --> 00:56:48,531
<i>Does Jandee doll</i>

685
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:50,491
<i>sound familiar to you?</i>

686
00:56:53,536 --> 00:56:55,704
Why are you wearing this with a wig?

687
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:58,916
-Give it back.
-Try taking off your wig.

688
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:02,128
That's right, Jandee. I'll give it back
if you take off your wig.

689
00:57:02,545 --> 00:57:03,879
-Give it back.
-Come on.

690
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:07,341
Take off your wig, Jandee doll!

691
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:08,551
What are you doing?

692
00:57:13,389 --> 00:57:14,849
I said, what are you doing?

693
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,063
Let's go.

694
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:23,482
Let's go. That was lame.

695
00:57:26,902 --> 00:57:28,612
<i>I think it was from that day...</i>

696
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:32,366
Hey, behind you! Pass it!

697
00:57:43,002 --> 00:57:45,087
<i>Your happy face...</i>

698
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:47,923
Can I have a band-aid?

699
00:57:48,007 --> 00:57:49,842
-Why? Are you hurt?
-Here.

700
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:51,135
Goodness.

701
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:54,221
<i>Watching your daily life,</i>

702
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:56,265
<i>became everything to me.</i>

NURSE ROOM (FEMALE STUDENTS)

704
00:58:01,437 --> 00:58:04,023
<i>Just watching you gave me strength.</i>

705
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:06,150
<i>Thank you.</i>

706
00:58:07,193 --> 00:58:08,194
<i>And...</i>

707
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:12,114
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if this letter can be delivered.</i>

708
00:58:13,032 --> 00:58:16,911
<i>Well... I don't have that kind of courage.</i>

709
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:22,833
<i>I don't know if I can dare</i>
<i>to have feelings.</i>

710
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,170
<i>I liked you.</i>

711
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:28,923
<i>A lot.</i>

712
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,512
<i>Right, I'm moving to the US.</i>

713
00:58:36,305 --> 00:58:38,432
<i>A new drug has been developed there.</i>

714
00:58:38,766 --> 00:58:42,228
<i>Well, I'm going to get treatment</i>
<i>and go to college in the US.</i>

715
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:45,898
<i>It will be difficult</i>

716
00:58:46,649 --> 00:58:47,858
<i>to see you again,</i>

717
00:58:48,943 --> 00:58:50,694
<i>but I will always support you.</i>

718
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:53,447
<i>I will never forget you.</i>

719
00:58:58,494 --> 00:59:00,412
He was popular

720
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:02,790
and had a lot of friends.

721
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:06,001
There's no way he likes me.

722
00:59:07,378 --> 00:59:08,671
I'm sick.

723
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:11,257
And I have no friends.

724
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,718
And I'm not pretty either.

725
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:18,889
Well, now I am.

726
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:22,351
But

727
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:24,144
now that I died,

728
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:26,480
I do regret it.

729
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,234
My feelings are more important.

730
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:34,697
Who cares if he pities me?

731
00:59:35,406 --> 00:59:37,241
And who cares if he doesn't like me?

732
00:59:38,117 --> 00:59:39,118
I should've

733
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:42,204
told him the truth.

734
00:59:45,499 --> 00:59:47,376
I should've told him.

735
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:51,463
I figured that out too late.

736
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:55,968
I shouldn't have hid my feelings.

737
01:00:00,389 --> 01:00:01,390
<i>I realized it</i>

738
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:03,600
<i>then.</i>

739
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:09,648
<i>We met in a strange way.</i>

740
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:11,400
Let's...

741
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:14,695
Let's break up.

742
01:00:17,698 --> 01:00:21,035
Yoo Byeong-su asked me to tell you.

743
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,831
I'm the one breaking up with you.

744
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:27,708
Please tell him that.

745
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:28,792
Gang-hee.

746
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:30,878
Gang-hee, wake up.

747
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:34,173
<i>You probably thought I was weird.</i>

748
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,179
No, it's not that.

749
01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:45,309
Are you out of your mind?

750
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:48,103
What did you tell him?

751
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:51,565
<i>When I knew it was a misunderstanding,</i>

752
01:00:52,483 --> 01:00:55,444
<i>I thought you would just pity me.</i>

753
01:00:56,028 --> 01:00:57,404
My younger brother

754
01:00:58,781 --> 01:00:59,990
died...

755
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:06,080
because of me.

756
01:01:06,372 --> 01:01:09,458
<i>Hearing that, I wanted to be by your side.</i>

757
01:01:12,753 --> 01:01:13,754
Kim Tae-hee.

758
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:22,971
<i>Your first love?</i>

759
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:24,598
<i>Yes.</i>

760
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:28,310
<i>Your first love,</i>
<i>who seemed to still remain in your heart,</i>

761
01:01:28,394 --> 01:01:29,978
<i>made me hesitate.</i>

762
01:01:32,981 --> 01:01:36,026
<i>No. I couldn't be honest.</i>

763
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,488
<i>"He wouldn't like me."</i>

764
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:42,199
<i>"He probably likes someone else."</i>

765
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:45,702
<i>My mind</i>

766
01:01:46,787 --> 01:01:49,331
<i>made so many excuses.</i>

767
01:02:06,515 --> 01:02:09,351
<i>You're coming tonight, right?</i>
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

768
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:45,971
<i>That's right,</i>

769
01:02:47,097 --> 01:02:51,518
<i>I wasn't the most honest with myself.</i>

770
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:11,663
Welcome.

771
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:15,417
-What's the name for your reservation?
-Kim Tae-hee.

772
01:03:16,335 --> 01:03:17,461
This way, please.

773
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:36,021
You're home late.

774
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:38,273
<i>If</i>

775
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,984
<i>it's not too late...</i>

776
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:53,455
Don't go.

777
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:11,765
I like you.

778
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:43,797
EPILOGUE

779
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,091
-Can I have a band-aid, please?
-Again?

780
01:05:04,192 --> 01:05:05,861
TO SEO-RIN

781
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:13,285
Tae-hyung, let's go! Hurry!

782
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:34,825
TO SEO-RIN
