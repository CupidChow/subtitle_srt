What was the name of the person
who passed away again?

5
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:05,274
Ugh, Babe!

6
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:09,361
Why is this empty head of his
so heavy?

7
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:13,407
CUTIE'S REQUEST
CHIEF MOURNER IS KIM SANG-DEUK!

00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:42,812
-Where you at?
<i>-Me? On the way to Gangjin.</i>

00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:45,940
<i>-</i>Gangjin? What for?
<i>-Apparently,</i>

12
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,025
"A man of nature" wants me to

13
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,986
take care of their dog
while they're streaming in Seoul.

14
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,405
<i>Man. What a world we live in.</i>

15
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,033
How close are you?

16
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,117
<i>Let's see…</i>

17
00:01:58,244 --> 00:01:59,245
<i>I just passed Mokpo.</i>

18
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:03,374
<i>What's wrong?</i>

19
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,835
It's nothing.

20
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,921
You don't want to go?

21
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,468
Guess whose funeral it is.

22
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:16,554
<i>Whose is it?</i>

23
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:21,725
-Kim Jun-ho.
-<i>Huh?</i>

24
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,066
Who?

25
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:30,442
A hundred…

26
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,361
HOW MUCH WOULD YOU LIKE
TO PAY A DIME A JOB?

27
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:33,737
…A thousand, ten thousand…

28
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,364
100 thousand…

29
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,493
I'm in a good mood, so…

30
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,788
Another 10,000 won!

31
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:43,873

00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,000

33
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,836
It's fine, you don't have to go.

34
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,969
1,000,000 WON RECEIVED
NIGHT SNACK'S ON ME.

35
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,637
<i>On second thought…</i>

36
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,932
I think they made a typo.

37
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,017
<i>Probably.</i>

38
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,477
Still.

39
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,063
You have to go at this point.

40
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:09,732
We just opened!

41
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,151
Okay.

ROOM SEVEN
KIM JUN-HO

44
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:00,426
Hello.

45
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:02,803
Hello.

46
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:08,851
-You're visiting room seven, right?
-Yes.

47
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,520
Uh…

48
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,981
Are you…

49
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,317
by chance the son?

50
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,112
<i>She should know</i>
<i>I'm from A Dime A Job.</i>

51
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:21,280
Yes.

52
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:28,912
But how are you...?

53
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:32,416
Oh, pardon me.
I'm taking care of Mr. Kim Jun-ho.

54
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,334
My name is Baek Dong-joo.

55
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:35,836
A funeral director.

56
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,339
<i>"The reason we're breaking up is…</i>

57
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,509
I don't want to hold your hand anymore.

58
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,970
What you do with your hands

59
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,723
at your new job horrifies me."

60
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,558
Is the… Uh…

61
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:54,521
Message that Mr. Yoo Byeong-su
has asked me to deliver.

62
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:02,821
So, how did you find out?
I really didn't expect you to come.

63
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:04,740
Didn't you send the message to me?

64
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:08,494
{\an8}OBITUARY
KIM JUN-HO

65
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,871
That's how you found out?

66
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,793
Yes. But what was
the meaning of that prank?

67
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,044
1,000,000 WON DEPOSITED

68
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,337
A prank?

69
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,631
-The message was not a prank.
-Huh?

70
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:24,802
I understand this may be a bit abrupt.

71
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,471
I really hoped you would come.

72
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,891
If you didn't come,
he would have been very lonely.

73
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,144
He would be extremely happy right now.

74
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:36,772
Hey…

75
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,858
It's good now that you're here, right?

76
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:42,194
it was a good idea to come,
no doubt about it.

77
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,530
Thank you so much for coming.

78
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,406
I'm not joking when I say

79
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,327
I've never been happier
in the 25 years I've lived.

80
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,746
I can't believe
we met here like this. Wow.

81
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:58,794
Well, anyways,
I really appreciate it.

82
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:01,588
Of course, Ms. Cutie.

83
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:03,549
What?

84
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:09,555
-Oh, right. Should we head in first?
-Sure.

85
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,195
Enjoy!

86
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:33,662
A WEIRD WOMAN

87
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,375
-Should I make you another one?
-Oh, no. It's okay.

88
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,919
Please, let me take care of it.

89
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,647
You may now head over to the other side.

90
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,691
All right.

91
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,276
Thank you for the food.

92
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:08,322
MR. BAEK'S
BAG FACTORY

93
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,218
Hey, kiddo, where are you?

94
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,180
I'm at the study hall, as always.

95
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:35,933
You haven't gone home yet?

96
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:38,393
It's so late!

97
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,605
It's not like you can cram
for a civil service exam.

98
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,775
You have to sleep
for your brain to function.

99
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,902
I'm just in the zone right now.

100
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,905
I'll be home soon, Dad.
You should go ahead to bed.

101
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,784
No, don't wait for me.

102
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,077
Yep, okay.

103
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,379
My goodness, what are we supposed to
do with the departure?

104
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,808
Did you sleep well?

105
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,311
Yes. I fell asleep at some point.

106
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:30,148
-Well, did <i>you </i>sleep well?
-Yes, of course. It was great.

107
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:33,860
I must have had too much <i>Jjajang ramyeon</i>
last night, falling asleep like that…

108
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:37,155
I'm really good at making <i>Jjajang ramyeon.</i>

109
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:38,573
-I see--
-Dong-joo.

110
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:39,866
Yes.

111
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,665
-Who is it?
-The chief mourner.

112
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,083
The chief mourner?

113
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,212
How is he related?

114
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:53,547
No idea.

115
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,132
"No idea?"
And he's the chief mourner?

116
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,301
How did you even know
he's the chief mourner?

117
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,345
He put on the armband like it's his.

118
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:04,307
This is very odd. I couldn't
reach the chief mourner today and panicked

119
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,102
thinking the transport schedule
was going to get messed up.

120
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,186
That guy…

121
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:10,814
I knew he would do something like that.

122
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,316
Good thing we have him now.

123
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,652
Right.

124
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:21,616
Good morning. Please, come inside.

125
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,494
-I'll be right back. Bathroom.
-Okay.

126
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,339
Where are you going?

127
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,175
Wait up!

128
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,552
You requested that I fill in until 7 a.m.

129
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,971
I'm leaving because I'm done.
Is there a problem?

130
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,514
What are you talking about?

131
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,184
I thought you said you sent this.

132
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,603
A DIME A JOB
WE GRANT YOU EVERYTHING

133
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,691
-You requested a chief mourner fill-in.
-I did?

134
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,902
-Aren't you Cutie?
-Cutie?

135
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,695
-You said you were.
-When?

136
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,030
What the…

137
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,783
Either way, I'm done with my job.
I'm going home!

138
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,786
Okay, I admit.
This was a good idea!

139
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,040
I understand. I bet
you resent him, even hate him.

140
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,584
You don't want to see him.

141
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,337
It was really hard for you
to come here. I know--

142
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,130
You just know everything, huh?

143
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:28,308
This? It's a burn mark
from when I was little.

144
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,311
Yeah, I know.

145
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,355
So what exactly do you know so well?

146
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,277
-The son.
-The son?

147
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:41,488
What about it?

148
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,741
The son…

149
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:47,327
Whose son are you talking about?

150
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:52,040
-I know Mr. Kim Jun-ho's son.
-Who is it?

151
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,588
Me? Suddenly?

152
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:00,423
-I'm not.
-You're not?

153
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,508
No. Absolutely not.

154
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,053
I'm a chief mourner fill-in from
A Dime A Job. That's ridiculous.

155
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:07,556
I saw it, though.

156
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:11,893
A teardrop.

157
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:15,939
I saw it.

158
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:17,941
A chief mourner fill-in

159
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:19,526
going this far?

160
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,319
That was…

161
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,363
a yawn!

162
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,531
It was a yawn.

163
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,449
That is so childish.

164
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,868
-Hey, Miss Baek Dong-joo.
-Yes, Mr. Kim Geon-woo?

165
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,453
Me?

166
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,830
My name is Kim Tae-hee.

167
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,292
My name would be Jung Woo-sung then.

168
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,377
For real, man.

169
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:40,839
BROTHER KIM SANG-DEUK

170
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,757
You said Kim Geon-woo, right?

171
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,926
No one's listed by that name.

172
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,220
He doesn't have a son.

173
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,808
Must have been left out!

174
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,935
Man, how long was it like this?

175
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,398
-Don't worry about it. It's just missing.
-I'm telling you it's not me.

176
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,526
Just help us 'till transport, please?

177
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,529
Just until the placement.
You're the fill-in, right?

178
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:07,657
Hey!

179
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,619
I have to tell you something.

180
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,662
It's your loss if you leave now!

181
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,957
What put him in a bad mood?

182
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,793
Come back if you change your mind!

183
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:26,760
<i>So?</i>

184
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,555
What kind of person was Mr. Kim Jun-ho?

185
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:32,182
An old man.

186
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,517
That I've never seen before.

187
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:36,394
<i>Yeah, well.</i>

188
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,023
The name is pretty common
in the Republic of Korea.

189
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,359
There's at least a few
at each school, for sure.

190
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,611
By the way,
nothing happened, right?

191
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,112
Something did.

192
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,281
What happened?

193
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:49,949
I met a weird woman, and…

194
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,665
DURING LEFT TURNS
DURING WALKING SIGNALS

195
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:57,791
I think I'm screwed.

196
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,847
I wonder why someone who left
without hesitation

197
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:15,183
when we begged him
to stay just until transport

198
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,352
came back out of the blue.

199
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:20,939
Destiny?

200
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,148
A miracle?

201
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:23,358
Yeah, right.

202
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,735
He's just a chief mourner fill-in.

203
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,696
He probably just wants some cash.

204
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,708
You're filling in for the chief mourner?

205
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,460
You've never met Mr. Kim in person, right?

206
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:44,629
Right.

207
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,674
TAXI DRIVER'S LICENSE
KIM JUN-HO

208
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:49,843
What was he like?

209
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,263
An unfortunate person.

210
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:57,016
But since he was a good man,

211
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,978
he must have earned these
valuable people after passing.

212
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:04,858
He looked so hard for his son.
Too bad he passed without finding him.

213
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:08,153
Son, you say?

214
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,240
Yeah. Open that glove compartment,
will you?

215
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,287
I placed it there while cleaning his car.

216
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,371
LOOKING FOR
KIM GEON-WOO

217
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:20,707
He had that taped
to the back seat at all times.

218
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,294
He's probably around your age now.

219
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:30,884
He should be under this same sky.

220
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:34,679
I wonder what he's doing,
unaware that his father is gone.

221
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:52,530
Excuse me.

222
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:54,824
Yes?

223
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,873
It's from my team leader.

224
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,792
No, it's okay.

225
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,127
Oh. Okay.

226
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,757
Anything else I can help you with?

227
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,013
I…

228
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:22,560
When I open my eyes in the morning,
on my way to work,

229
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:24,979
eating or working,

230
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,273
or at home.

231
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:31,903
In all of those moments
I think that my mother watches over me.

232
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:32,946
-Pardon?

233
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,240
So when I'm struggling really hard

234
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:38,618
I sometimes pray to my mom for some help.

235
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:41,538
And…

236
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,336
-Do you like <i>Kongnamul gukbap?</i>
<i>-</i>Huh?

237
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,505
There's apparently
a great place on the way back.

238
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:53,091
Taxi drivers know
all the great restaurants, you know?

239
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,968
Come with us even if you're not hungry.

240
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:57,595
I'll take the bus home.

241
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,473
-Why? Buses are uncomfortable.
-Beats being with you.

242
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:02,934
Dong-joo.

243
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,480
Go on.

244
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:16,197
So…

245
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,493
I was going to tell you
at the restaurant, but…

246
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:28,918
Forever Life.

247
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:32,046
-Excuse me?
-Life insurance.

248
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:35,133
What life insurance?

249
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:38,177
I feel bad talking about this stuff
at this time.

250
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:40,471
I'm afraid the old man
might take all of it.

251
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:42,098
You know, your supposed uncle.

252
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:47,395
He was only there for the food. He got
so drunk he didn't even show up today.

253
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:51,608
What if he went
to get the insurance money?

254
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,110
But don't worry, you're first priority.

255
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:55,653
Look here.

256
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,156
Do you still think I'm the son?

257
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,284
I saw the stuff in the cab. I did.

258
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,955
I can see how you misunderstood,
but it's not me.

259
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:07,540
-For real?
-Yes.

260
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,876
Then why are you back?

261
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,843
I'm not sure.

262
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,223
-Dong-joo.
-Coming.

263
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,309
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

264
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:01,427
BONGSU STATION

265
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,373
I am the acting chief mourner.

266
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:44,929
This was in the cab.

267
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,566
Stay put. I need to take a leak.

268
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:01,863
Uncle…

269
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,493
It's been exactly three nights, right?

270
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:11,122
Dad's not here, is he?

271
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:16,127
Who abandoned you?

272
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:19,756
Your dad.

273
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:23,634
<i>I wanted my dad</i>

274
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:26,596
<i>to be unfortunate.</i>

275
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:28,931
<i>Like me who was abandoned,</i>

276
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,100
<i>adopted,</i>

277
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:33,770
<i>and then sent back.</i>

278
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:35,897
<i>I thought that</i>

279
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:39,400
<i>he should be as unfortunate as me…</i>

280
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:41,486
LOOKING FOR KIM GEON-WOO
PLEASE CALL

281
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,571
<i>…until I'm satisfied.</i>

282
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:48,201
Oh, that's my son.

283
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,162
Please take a close look,
and give me a call

284
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,456
if you see anyone that looks like him.

285
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,168
You see Bongsu Station right there?

286
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,463
My son went missing there.

287
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:08,638
Young man,
do you believe in miracles?

288
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:11,974
I know it sounds random, but…

289
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:15,394
I bring it up because you were studying
my son's picture so closely.

290
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:17,647
I believe in miracles.

291
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,360
People tell me
I won't be able to find my son.

292
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,531
A connection between father and child
is not that weak.

293
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:30,409
I have a feeling I'll be able to meet him.

294
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:31,869
I <i>will </i>meet him, for sure.

295
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:36,082
I better meet him before I'm dead

296
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,334
since miracles exist.

297
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:53,808
Is there…

298
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:58,521
a good Chinese restaurant nearby?

299
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:02,441
I was rambling like a fool, wasn't I?

300
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:05,695
I'm sorry, I don't really know.

301
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,446
I don't eat <i>Jjajangmyeon</i>.

302
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,993
I'm only going to have it with my son
when I find him.

303
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:18,499
I promised him I would buy him some.

304
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:30,178
Here you go.

305
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,722
Thanks for riding. Have a good day.

306
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:42,607
<i>The last farewell.</i>

307
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:48,237
<i>I wanted to pretend I didn't recognize</i>
<i>that miraculous encounter.</i>

308
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:53,451
<i>I wanted to leave scratches on you</i>
<i>as much as I could.</i>

309
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:55,203
KIM JUN-HO DECEASED

310
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:56,704
<i>Please forgive me for that day.</i>

311
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,163
Dad…

312
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:44,460
<i>I made a mistake.</i>

313
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:46,712
<i>Dad.</i>

314
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,384
Dad!

315
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:01,579
DAD

316
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:05,124
<i>Just had this with your mom.</i>
<i>It really hits the spot.</i>

317
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:09,587
<i>Tae-hee, come home sometime</i>
<i>to have it together. Enjoy your lunch!</i>

318
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:21,515
Enjoy!

319
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:36,447
<i>Oh, by the way, you would need a DNA test.</i>

320
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:39,742
<i>Don't forget, it's Forever Life Insurance!</i>

321
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,625
Seriously, why are you doing this to me?

322
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,210
It's not me. Okay?

323
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:53,672
My name is Kim Tae-hee,
and my father's name is Kim Min-seok.

324
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:56,550
He used to be a champion
of the Sogongdong Badminton club.

325
00:27:56,634 --> 00:28:00,471
My father's alive and healthy enough
to swim in the ocean. Stop this nonsense.

326
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:06,143
Actually, that's not important right now.

327
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,438
The real son has appeared.

328
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,736
I'm not trying to sell you anything!

329
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:19,281
Yes. That's exactly what I mean.

330
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:24,286
I also don't know why I'm here.
I think I'm possessed by something.

331
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:31,127
The son. I told you multiple times
that I am not the son.

332
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:33,546
Should I start over?
My name is Kim Tae-hee…

333
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,132
8 YEARS AGO

334
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,259
JJANGWON KIMBAP

335
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:48,561
Check, please!

336
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:54,859
-It'll be 4,000 won.
-One sec.

337
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,953
I think I left my wallet at home.
I'll wire it.

338
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,163
Excuse me?

339
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,374
Then I'll run home and back quickly.

340
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:13,377
-Oh, this is ridiculous.
-I'm so sorry.

341
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:14,628
-I'll pay for him.
-What?

342
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:17,089
Run our checks together.
I had <i>kimchi jjigae</i>.

343
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:18,174
Okay.

344
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:22,595
Thank you.

345
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:25,389
I'm not sure how I can repay you for this.

346
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,558
If you could give me a number…

347
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,269
If we meet again, you can repay me then.

348
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:33,981
You just remind me of my son.

349
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:41,447
Thank you!

350
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,485
KIM JUN-HO
5/9/2011 - 10/9/2020

351
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:54,979
This will probably work better.

352
00:31:02,236 --> 00:31:03,112
Thank you.

353
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,293
A DIME A JOB

354
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:22,715
Where are you headed to?

355
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,679
My wife loves the mountains,

356
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:32,516
so I built her a home
in the middle of all this nature,

357
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:35,060
but that made it hard for me to visit.

358
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,397
I'm causing other people trouble.

359
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,858
Not at all. It's on the way anyways.

360
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:45,279
Who were you visiting?

361
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,909
I saw the graduation date earlier.
They were rather new.

362
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,331
Gets on your mind, right?

363
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:58,876
It did for me too.

364
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,171
Don't you worry about them, though.

365
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:07,676
Tomorrow makes it exactly 25 years
since my wife went over.

366
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:09,970
She must be a master at

367
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:14,642
taking care of the newcomers over there
and stuff like that by now.

368
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:19,021
She'll make sure they eat
and go on walks together.

369
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:23,567
Speaking of which, they're probably
enjoying a nice cold watermelon right now.

370
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:29,698
She's got a heart of gold like that.

371
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:33,327
Thank you.

372
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,793
By the way, what is A Dime A Job?

373
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,796
Oh, it's an errand company.

374
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:46,965
Oh, I think I've seen on the news

375
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:49,343
that there's a new career

376
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:52,763
that does stuff like
shopping and laundry for other people.

377
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:54,473
That's correct.

378
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:56,975
Man.

379
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,477
Young people like you

380
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:00,688
live such hard lives.

381
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:04,191
You must be around my daughter's age.

382
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:07,986
She's working hard preparing for
the civil service exam too.

383
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,115
Studying with no guarantee.

384
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:15,452
Way too hard.

385
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,427
Excuse me,
can you get us some more <i>pyeonyuk?</i>

386
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,553
Right away.

387
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,600
MR. BAEK'S BAG FACTORY

388
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:46,859
You could have just dropped me off
at the closest main road.

389
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,444
I owe you big today.

390
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,779
-It's really not a problem at all.
-Thank you!

391
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:54,533
-Have a good evening.
-You too.

392
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:04,918
In my experience, nothing beats company
when going through a loss.

393
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,213
This is a purse shop I run.

394
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,550
It's a bit shabby,
but come visit whenever you want.

395
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,262
-Okay.
-Great.

396
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,848
-See you.
-Take care.

397
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,154
YOU'RE JUST GONNA LEAVE?

398
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:36,033
-Hi. I'll just have a bottle of soju.
-You got it.

399
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,460
-You want some <i>dakttongjip</i>?
-Sure. Thank you.

400
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:57,930
-Are you okay?
-He doesn't usually drink!

401
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,643
-You're completely wasted!
-Oh, I'm sorr--

402
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:04,770
Who...?

403
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:08,816
-Better call a driver.
-Oh, I'm the driver.

404
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:11,985
During the day,
an assistant manager for eternity.

405
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:14,363
At night, a surrogate driver.
Nice to meet you!

406
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:17,783
He's a salesman working two jobs.
He waits for driver jobs here at night.

407
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:20,160
-Mister, let me drive you home tonight.
-Okay.

408
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:22,496
-Weren't you drinking?
-Not a drop yet.

409
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,414
-That's good.
-Sir, where do you live?

410
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:30,420
A DIME A JOB

411
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,181
Ding dong.

412
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,268
Yes, do you need something?

413
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:45,936
Oh.

414
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,730
This ding dong.

415
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,358
I'm sorry. Sorry!

416
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:57,197
I was born in '74, year of tiger.

417
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:00,742
I thought you were in your 30s.

418
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:03,370
Ding dong!

419
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,289
A sales comment?

420
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:08,458
Not at all.
Your hair is completely black.

421
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:10,377
That's thanks to my wife.

422
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:15,591
She goes through my head
and pulls the gray all out for me.

423
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:21,680
Oh, my dear wife.
If only she didn't like money so much.

424
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:29,688
There's…

425
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:33,275
100,000,000 won in here!

426
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:36,904
-Okay.
-Oh, you don't believe it? Look.

427
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:41,325
-I'll show you. It's right here.
-Careful, that's a lot of money!

428
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:46,538
It's fine. It's safe.
As long as you keep it quiet.

429
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:48,206
Of course. I won't tell anyone.

430
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:52,336
Then it's fine. No one will know.

431
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:56,173
I'm going to give it

432
00:36:58,467 --> 00:37:00,719
to my wife on our anniversary.

433
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,056
What a good plan.

434
00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:06,975
Keep it safe until then.

435
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:12,147
Don't even worry about that.

436
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:17,778
I'm exhausted.

437
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,747
HYUN JUNG-HWA
TABLE TENNIS CLUB

438
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:33,251
Why do you ask for trouble?
Your dad even let you study.

439
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:36,546
What's with
all the secrets and double life?

440
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:39,174
It's not for long.
I just need to do it until the fall.

441
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:43,303
You crawled back in there for that?
What for? Money?

442
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:46,181
Yes. I need money.

443
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,683
-I need to go.
-Huh?

444
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:54,356
I hear funeral directors get paid a lot.

445
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:57,067
Why didn't you tell us?
Take us out to dinner! How's tomorrow?

446
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,944
Something simple. <i>Samgyeopsal?</i>
It's perfect!

447
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:01,905
What's this?

448
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:06,201
You said your hands
got all dry from your job.

449
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:14,126
They're the only pretty part of your body.
You should take care of them.

450
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:19,089
Someone gave it to me.
I had no use for it.

451
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:22,426
Thank you. See ya.

452
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:24,386
Bye.

453
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:29,683
What was that about?
Was it so hard to just say happy birthday?

454
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:31,518
-Stupid.
-Speak for yourself.

455
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:52,414
It took long for you
to get to that first glass.

456
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:56,251
Yeah, what a long day.

457
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:41,421
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

458
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:47,094
-Come on out!
-Okay.

459
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:09,699
This is for the baby,
and this is the mother's.

460
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:17,707

Can I…

464
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,209
try calling you mom?

465
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:04,629
Mom.

466
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:11,219
Mom.

467
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:15,765
I'm sorry.

468
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,020
I'm sorry…

469
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:27,903
that you died…

470
00:41:30,614 --> 00:41:32,032
because of me.

471
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:49,841
Oh no, Dad. I have to get going.

472
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:51,384
Just take this with you.

473
00:41:52,052 --> 00:41:56,681
-I was gonna get a burger today.
-Nonsense! Here, it's all done.

474
00:41:58,058 --> 00:42:00,936
-Take it.
-You didn't have to do this much work.

475
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:04,272
Geez, kid, you have to eat well.

476
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:07,067
-You need to eat well to study well.
-Whatever.

477
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,070
I'm getting worried about you.

478
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:13,531
Take a day off sometime.
Let's go shopping together.

479
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:16,076
I'll buy you clothes, shoes, everything.
Top quality stuff.

480
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,870
You've been at that study hall every day.
You need a break!

481
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:21,790
How are you going to afford that, Dad?
You have no money.

482
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,417
Baek Dal-shik is nothing without money.

483
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:27,712
Okay. Baek Dal-shik is super rich.
The best!

484
00:42:27,796 --> 00:42:29,464
Your dad is working hard.

485
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,758
Feeding one more mouth is
not even a problem!

486
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:34,052
Don't you worry about that,
just do your thing.

487
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:36,179
And don't even think about
going back there!

488
00:42:36,263 --> 00:42:37,555
Sir, yes, sir!

489
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:39,933
-I'll be going now.
-Have a good day.

490
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,126
Jung-ran.

491
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:08,795
Thanks for giving us Dong-joo.

492
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:15,844
Isn't our daughter beautiful?

493
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:18,179
She's already 25.

494
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,598
Her eyes, the way she walks,

495
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:23,518
even her laugh is
a splitting image of you.

496
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:26,062
She looks more like you every day.

497
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:29,607
I'm sure you're already working on it,

498
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:31,693
but please take care of Dong-joo.

499
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:34,779
Help her to not struggle so much.

500
00:43:35,155 --> 00:43:37,532
Maybe even help her pass
that civil service exam.

501
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:40,035
Please watch over her.

502
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:43,538
But I guess…

503
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:48,126
our daughter is not going to
have her <i>miyeokguk </i>again this year.

504
00:44:14,194 --> 00:44:16,321
-Oh, hello.
-Hi.

505
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:21,409
I didn't know you were married.
You're a good father.

506
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,454
I'm not married. I'm just working.

507
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:27,499
Working, huh?

508
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:30,502
You have so many different jobs.

509
00:44:31,628 --> 00:44:34,798
-I want to say the same to you.
-Me?

510
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:38,218
You were so worried about
the insurance money.

511
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:41,096
-That's not a part of your job, is it?
-Oh, right.

512
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,515
-So did you take the DNA test?
-Wh--?

513
00:44:44,391 --> 00:44:46,684
I'm sure I told you on the phone.

514
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:48,186
I'm not the son.

515
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:51,189
-You're lying.
-How many times do I have to tell you?

516
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,324
-Oh no!
-I'm sorry.

517
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,576
Sorry.

518
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:10,708
What should I…

519
00:45:24,848 --> 00:45:27,725
Sorry, please stop!

520
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,822
I'm sorry. Really sorry.

521
00:45:42,282 --> 00:45:43,324
It's fine.

522
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:44,701
Is this your lunch?

523
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:46,578
So sorry about this.

524
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:51,040
This is my fault.
I'll pay for your lunch today.

525
00:45:53,001 --> 00:45:55,336
-You don't have to.
-I don't have cash right now.

526
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,881
-If you give me your bank account number--
-It's fine!

527
00:45:59,466 --> 00:46:01,134
This isn't fine for me.

528
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:03,845
-Please let me, even if it's not a lot.
-Geon-woo.

529
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:06,514
How much, then?

530
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:09,642
-Huh?
-How much can you pay me?

531
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:13,646
How much?

532
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:16,816
In this world, there are
many things that money can't do.

533
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:20,528
Oh, I guess
you don't know much about that

534
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:23,781
since you deliver break-up messages
for money

535
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:27,160
and need payment to go
to your own father's funeral.

536
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:28,995
But that's not me.

537
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:34,792
Look here.

538
00:46:35,919 --> 00:46:39,422
This was an accident. Don't you think
that's a little uncalled for?

539
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:43,551
And don't look so high and mighty
when you also paid me to beat someone up.

540
00:46:43,635 --> 00:46:45,470
-Well, did you?
-Of course not!

541
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:49,182
-We don't ever do violent or illegal acts!
-But you took my money!

542
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:50,266
Come on!

543
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:55,730
How is you forcing it in my pocket
accepting the money? Huh?

544
00:46:56,648 --> 00:47:00,360
I'll give it back, so stop making me
into his weird person.

545
00:47:04,072 --> 00:47:07,367
Hey, a green mother is supposed to be
guiding traffic, not disrupting it!

546
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,827
I'm so sorry!

547
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:11,162
Whose parent are you?

548
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:14,958
I'm not actually a parent.
I'm really sorry.

549
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:18,336
Dong-joo!

550
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,130
Oh, sorry!

551
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,466
Sorry about that.

552
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:27,262
All right, go ahead!

553
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,598
Let's see what
the moms in the area are up to.

554
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:39,190
"Just moments ago,
in front of Bongmoon Elementary?"

555
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:42,986
{\an8}<i>Just now, did anyone witness</i>
<i>the green mother?</i>

556
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:46,614
{\an8}<i>"</i>A witness… It was a big shock."

557
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:51,911
{\an8}"<i>Apparently, he's from A Dime A Job.</i>
<i>He threw the flag on the ground</i>

558
00:47:51,995 --> 00:47:55,415
{\an8}<i>and was arguing with someone in the</i>
<i>middle of the crossroad at a red light!"</i>

559
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,500
{\an8}-Arguing?
"<i>They spilled miyeokguk too."</i>

560
00:47:57,584 --> 00:47:59,002
{\an8}<i>Almost slipped and got hurt…</i>

561
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:00,587
{\an8}-What is this?
-<i>Looked like an ex-girlfriend.</i>

562
00:48:01,087 --> 00:48:03,172
{\an8}<i>-</i>Ex-girlfriend…
-<i>It looked like a money issue.</i>

563
00:48:03,256 --> 00:48:04,424
{\an8}<i>Did she lend him money?</i>

564
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:07,176
{\an8}<i>Having a lover's quarrel</i>
<i>while working as a green mother.</i>

565
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,928
{\an8}<i>This company won't do.</i>

566
00:48:09,012 --> 00:48:11,389
{\an8}<i>I'm canceling my reservations.</i>

567
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:14,225
<i>-I'm starting a boycott today.</i>
<i>-I'm joining the boycott.</i>

568
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:18,438
<i>-Me too!</i>
<i>-</i>Oh no, please. I'm sorry.

569
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:22,150
Are you kidding me?

570
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:25,320
Why in the world would I pay
for service like this?

571
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:27,322
SEOUL BONGMOON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

572
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,658
I'm sorry.

573
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:40,627
REQUEST HAS BEEN CANCELED.

574
00:48:47,884 --> 00:48:50,762
No way, our employee…
There must be some kind of a mistake.

575
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:53,181
Yes, of course we will cancel.

576
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:56,392
Hello? Yes, we will refund it
through your bank acc--

577
00:48:56,476 --> 00:48:57,727
-Hello?
-A Dime A Job.

578
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:00,688
No, of course we'll refund your money.
We always do.

579
00:49:00,772 --> 00:49:04,025
-Certainly, we will right now. Apologies.
-No Bullshit Seoul Headquarters?

580
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:07,528
Yes, I apologize.
We'll be careful next time.

581
00:49:11,074 --> 00:49:12,158
-Hello.
-A Dime A Job.

582
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:16,329
-Yes of course we will…
-If you can give us a little more time…

583
00:49:29,509 --> 00:49:30,510
Hey, man.

584
00:49:30,843 --> 00:49:32,553
What the hell is wrong with you?

585
00:49:34,389 --> 00:49:35,765
Did you spill the <i>miyeokguk?</i>

586
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:38,017
Answer me, did you?!

587
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:40,812
-All over the road?!
-He spilled it all over.

588
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:42,480
Did the kids almost slip on it?

589
00:49:42,772 --> 00:49:45,483
-Was it dangerous or not?!
-It definitely was.

590
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:46,943
And who is that girl?

591
00:49:47,777 --> 00:49:48,820
Was it her <i>miyeokguk</i>?

592
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:50,988
Yeah. She's the girl from before.

593
00:49:51,072 --> 00:49:53,491
The girl that asked me
to kick her ex's shin.

594
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:55,326
You got money from her too?

595
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,707
-You should have given it back right away!
-You just bounced.

596
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:03,292
And you argue with her
like you did anything right?

597
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:05,670
-In front of all those people!
-He'll get fired.

598
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:08,673
You think you can get away
with everything because I like you?!

599
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:10,383
Do you really want to see me dead?

600
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:13,344
If this one goes under too,
your uncle's really going to die!

601
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:14,762
You're his uncle?!

602
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:16,264
I'm his uncle.

603
00:50:19,726 --> 00:50:23,062
Well, then, I guess he won't get fired.
Uncle, huh?

604
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:27,817
You. Go find her right now.

605
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:30,695
Find her, give her a refund,
and beg for forgiveness.

606
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:32,321
Take care of it, all right?

607
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:38,369
Yes, sir.

608
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:42,373
KIM JUN-HO'S SON KIM GEON-WOO

609
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:54,844
<i>I'll return your 50,000 won.</i>
<i>I would like to properly apologize too.</i>

610
00:50:55,136 --> 00:50:57,472
<i>I'm in trouble. Please call back.</i>

611
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:03,770
This sucks.

612
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:09,525
Did you talk to her?

613
00:51:11,319 --> 00:51:12,487
No answer. I sent a text.

614
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:17,325
How is giving money so hard to do?

615
00:51:21,204 --> 00:51:22,205
Going somewhere?

616
00:51:22,622 --> 00:51:25,082
Work. The one job
that didn't get canceled.

617
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,168
-I'll go.
-No thanks.

618
00:51:29,796 --> 00:51:30,797
-Hey!
-I'll be back.

619
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,591
You better do your job right!

620
00:51:41,641 --> 00:51:42,642
Hey, guard.

621
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:46,479
Please park it close to the 1302 building.
It takes too long otherwise.

622
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:50,149
And there's some groceries in the back.
Can you bring those up?

623
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:54,987
Yes, ma'am.

624
00:52:09,961 --> 00:52:11,170
Oh, man.

625
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:17,510
Why is it so… This spot is…

626
00:52:24,267 --> 00:52:25,434
My goodness.

627
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:43,619
Oh no!

628
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:02,054
Ma'am.

629
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,728
Please accept this as an apology.

630
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:09,896
No, thank you.

631
00:53:09,979 --> 00:53:12,857
-You said you'll take care of it.
-Of course, I will, but…

632
00:53:13,149 --> 00:53:15,902
You won't have a car for a while
because of me.

633
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:20,114
You should've been careful if you know.
It'll be listed when I sell it!

634
00:53:20,907 --> 00:53:22,074
I don't need the juice.

635
00:53:22,158 --> 00:53:24,368
Just throw this away for me
on your way down.

636
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,207
Okay.

637
00:53:32,919 --> 00:53:35,922
Don't tape those on our doors!
They fill up our trash bags.

638
00:53:36,005 --> 00:53:38,549
Guard, what is the security office
doing about this?

639
00:53:38,633 --> 00:53:40,593
I believe they have permission,

640
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:41,802
but the leasing office…

641
00:53:42,345 --> 00:53:43,638
I'm sorry.

642
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:56,859
Hello.

643
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:13,876
-Please give it back.
-It's fine. I'll toss it on my way out.

644
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:16,337
Oh, man.

645
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:21,759
They didn't attach this straight.

646
00:54:24,387 --> 00:54:27,932
I'm working here to kill some time.

647
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:31,936
-Really, I'll take that ba--
-I think you're getting a call.

648
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:33,020
Oh.

649
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:40,945
Hey, Dong-joo.

650
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:42,780
Me?

651
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:48,369
I'm at the shop, of course.

652
00:54:49,245 --> 00:54:50,246
Are you in class?

653
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:53,040
Oh, break time. I see.

654
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:56,168
<i>You must be around my daughter's age.</i>

655
00:54:56,252 --> 00:54:59,005
she works hard preparing for
the civil service exam too.

656
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:00,798
<i>Works too hard.</i>

657
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:07,763
I made that <i>miyeokguk</i>
with everything I had this morning.

658
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:12,018
I wonder if you ate it or not?

659
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:16,272
You could have taken
a break on a day like this.

660
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:19,400
What do you mean?
It's a really good day.

661
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:22,278
It's the day you were born.

662
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:23,612
Hey, kiddo, one sec.

663
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:33,873
There's no better day than today.

664
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,506
Okay. You don't have to worry about me.

665
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:45,634
Yeah, you too, Dad.

666
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:03,694
<i>Did you find her yet?</i>

667
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:05,404
Nope.

668
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,656
I'll find her soon.

669
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:08,783
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

670
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:11,660
You haven't done anything right all day.

671
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:14,955
-What are you gonna do with the flyers?
-<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

672
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:17,583
-<i>You wor--</i>
-You would too if you were me!

673
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:22,004
I have a hidden move.

674
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,380
<i>A hidden move?</i>

675
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,027
Hi, Dad.

676
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:28,904
<i>Hey, kid, where are you?</i>

677
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:34,577
I was planning on grabbing dinner
with So-ra and Jung-hwa today.

678
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:38,831
Yeah, sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

679
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:42,793
Yep. Enjoy your dinner, Dad.

680
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:44,795
Okay.

681
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:54,597
Please take this.

682
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:56,515
Thank you.

683
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:00,394
I hope you have a great evening!

684
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:04,231
Please, here.

685
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:08,360
What is this?

686
00:58:10,196 --> 00:58:11,780
Got your tail!

687
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:22,166
Stop.

688
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:25,961
{\an8}<i>What's everyone's dinner?</i>
<i>What should I have? Samgyeopsal? Agujjim?</i>

689
00:58:26,045 --> 00:58:28,380
<i>I have a lesson, so just a kimbap.</i>

690
00:58:28,464 --> 00:58:31,926
<i>How about Dong-joo? What are you having</i>
<i>instead of samgyeopsal with me?</i>

691
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:33,594
<i>Have steak, Dong-joo.</i>

692
00:58:43,354 --> 00:58:45,898
Hey, I told you to stop.
Yeah, you, bubbles.

693
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:03,499
-No more.
-Kids, stop that. Let's go.

694
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:05,000
Sorry about that.

695
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:10,631
Where did my tail go?

696
00:59:12,383 --> 00:59:14,176
I can't see anything through this.

697
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:15,719
Here it is.

698
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:34,280
<i>What do you mean?</i>
<i>It's a really good day.</i>

699
00:59:34,822 --> 00:59:36,782
<i>It's the day you were born.</i>

700
01:00:33,005 --> 01:00:34,757
You must be getting proposed to.

701
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,217
-Congratulations!
-You're so lucky.

702
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:09,333
Holy crap!

703
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:15,714
Can I help you…?

704
01:02:09,268 --> 01:02:11,103
Hey, Uncle, when did you get here?

705
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,021
What is wrong with you!

706
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:15,524
This is it?

707
01:02:15,983 --> 01:02:19,987
You said you were handing out flyers.
Why are you dancing all of a sudden?

708
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:23,490
-So you saw.
-You feel like dancing, huh?

709
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:27,077
You're happy, huh? So happy
that you just can't help yourself?

710
01:02:29,121 --> 01:02:31,832
I was trying to get people's attention.

711
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:33,667
Just a way to get attention.

712
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,960
I see.

713
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:39,715
So you caught people's attention like that
and still have all these flyers left?

714
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:42,259
Who was that girl? You know her?

715
01:02:43,635 --> 01:02:46,096
-Who?
-You were just with her.

716
01:02:46,847 --> 01:02:50,225
-Was that the girl from this morning?
-Oh, no.

717
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:53,937
I went over to check because that's what
I thought too, but it wasn't her.

718
01:02:55,898 --> 01:02:57,733
I'm going to lose it!

719
01:02:58,317 --> 01:02:59,318
Listen.

720
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:01,111
We have zero orders. Zero!

721
01:03:01,195 --> 01:03:03,614
At this rate we're really gonna go under.

722
01:03:04,573 --> 01:03:07,242
-Give me her phone number, I'll call her--
-No!

723
01:03:07,326 --> 01:03:08,911
I'll do it.

724
01:03:13,499 --> 01:03:14,374
I beg you,

725
01:03:15,209 --> 01:03:16,752
please give me a call.

726
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:20,672
50,000 won.

727
01:03:20,756 --> 01:03:22,466
I REALLY WANT TO RETURN IT TO YOU.

728
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,055
Hurry up with this.

729
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,810
Dad, there was a construction site.
I broke those passing by it.

730
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:36,772
Wow, you finished the soup!

731
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,566
Huh? Yeah.

732
01:03:40,108 --> 01:03:42,778
How was it? You finished the rice too!

733
01:03:43,654 --> 01:03:44,988
Yeah it was good.

734
01:03:45,531 --> 01:03:48,450
-Dad, let me go change.
-Okay, hurry up.

735
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:50,536
Wow, she finished everything.

736
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:15,894
{\an8}WHAT A HAPPY DAY!
WHO ARE YOU WITH RIGHT NOW?

737
01:04:32,828 --> 01:04:37,541
{\an8}YOUR LOVED ONE. CAN'T LEAVE OUT BREAD
ON A DAY LIKE THIS! BREAD MAKES US HAPPIER

738
01:04:55,142 --> 01:04:57,102
Dad, can we have cake?

739
01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:00,272
-For real?
-Yeah!

740
01:05:05,027 --> 01:05:06,111
We don't have

741
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,572
many months left.

742
01:05:10,073 --> 01:05:11,325
Before this year passes,

743
01:05:12,117 --> 01:05:14,995
please give me a man to sleep with.

744
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:18,874
-I'm pleading.
-You're so desperate.

745
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:21,918
You should be desperate too.
Pray you get a kiss, at least.

746
01:05:22,002 --> 01:05:24,338
Forget it.
Why are you making a wish, suddenly?

747
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:27,090
Is it because it's Dong-joo's birthday?
-Look.

748
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:28,675
The moon is up.

749
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:37,517
-You can see that?
-Look with your inner mind's eye.

750
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:54,034
-Are you making a wish?
-Yep.

751
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,162
What did you wish for?

752
01:05:58,664 --> 01:05:59,748
For my dad

753
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,000
to get a girlfriend!

754
01:06:03,335 --> 01:06:04,711
You're silly.

755
01:06:15,806 --> 01:06:17,015
<i>I'll pretend I received it.</i>

756
01:06:19,267 --> 01:06:20,352
What you waiting for?

757
01:06:21,937 --> 01:06:23,188
I was just about to type.

758
01:06:26,858 --> 01:06:29,069
<i>Please, I really want to return it.</i>

759
01:06:33,407 --> 01:06:36,743
<i>-Sure, if we happen to meet again.</i>
-"Again?"

760
01:06:38,286 --> 01:06:42,207
-You met her? Where?
-Oh, you know, at the crossroads just no…

761
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:45,293
What is this? Are you pranking me?

762
01:06:45,377 --> 01:06:48,880
-Give me her number.
-Uncle, calm down.

763
01:06:50,716 --> 01:06:54,469
I'll take care of it. I promise.
Don't you worry about it.

764
01:07:01,977 --> 01:07:05,188
-It must be really heavy. Thank you.
-Not a problem.

765
01:07:07,274 --> 01:07:10,152
I saw your name tag on
my brother-in-law's jacket pocket.

766
01:07:10,402 --> 01:07:12,195
I really appreciate the call.

767
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:16,825
My sister's been
really struggling since he passed.

768
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:22,205
I thought we should
get rid of his stuff as soon as possible.

769
01:07:23,123 --> 01:07:25,083
I did some of it, but…

770
01:07:27,878 --> 01:07:31,423
You'll probably have to just
toss all of his stuff.

771
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:35,719
This is his drawer. And…

772
01:07:36,303 --> 01:07:37,804
Oh, not this one. This one then.

773
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:41,224
-This one?
-Yes. Oh, I forgot the trash bags.

774
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:00,368
EPILOGUE

775
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:04,539
This one, please.

776
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:07,250
This one? How many candles would you like?

777
01:08:07,793 --> 01:08:08,919
Twenty five.

778
01:08:11,505 --> 01:08:13,465
-Just one, please.
-Okay.

779
01:08:17,385 --> 01:08:18,929
{\an8}TODAY'S GUARD: BAEK DAL-SHIK

780
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:25,811
At this time?

781
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:27,604
I have some sweets.

782
01:08:58,426 --> 01:09:00,762
{\an8}-What are you doing here?
-There is a box in this room.

783
01:09:00,846 --> 01:09:03,014
{\an8}There's 100,000,000 won in there.
Help me find it.

784
01:09:03,431 --> 01:09:04,975
{\an8}Why are you like this?

785
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:08,019
{\an8}Because of you,
A Dime A Job might close down.

786
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:09,604
{\an8}What? You're scaring me.

787
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:11,815
{\an8}Were you wearing that
when you left earlier?

788
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,234
{\an8}Should I move out until fall?

789
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:15,235
{\an8}Wow.

790
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:19,114
{\an8}A lady I fell in love with at first sight
moved into the apartment next door.

791
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:20,115
{\an8}What do you think?

792
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:21,074
{\an8}Fate?

793
01:09:21,491 --> 01:09:22,409
{\an8}Destiny?
