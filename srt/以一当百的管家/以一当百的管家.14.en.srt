1
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:40,583
{\an8}I can't even smoke
a cigarette before I go.

2
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:45,004
{\an8}It would've been nice
if I had a shot of soju.

3
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:48,048
{\an8}I couldn't even say goodbye
to my younger brother.

4
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,887
{\an8}I couldn't see Mi-young.

5
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,015
{\an8}I wonder if she got married.

6
00:00:56,557 --> 00:01:00,519
Do you remember the accident
you caused two years ago?

7
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:03,314
I said, do you remember?

8
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:08,194
Is the kid alive?

9
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,741
No.

10
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:22,792
I feel so bad for that kid.

11
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:26,378
But I can't do anything. I'm dead too.

12
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,175
You didn't kill him.

13
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,477
Who killed him?

14
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,771
That kid?

15
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:55,157
It was me that killed him.

16
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:57,952
I was drunk driving.

17
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:00,246
-And ran over him--
-You're lying.

18
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,040
If you did,
I shouldn't be able to see you right now.

19
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,586
My goodness!

20
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:08,879
That night,

21
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,382
what exactly happened?

22
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,429
I already told you,
I ran over him while driving drunk!

23
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:21,141
Joon-ho's family lives in hell
every day after they sent him off.

24
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,020
Resenting you, when you're lying in bed,
not paying for your crime.

25
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:31,151
Why get resentment when you didn't do it?

26
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,028
Don't you feel mistreated?

27
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:37,074
I'll deliver it.
I'll deliver your message, so--

28
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,368
Let them resent me if they want to!

29
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,288
I've always been like this.

30
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:45,791
I don't give a crap
about what other people think of me,

31
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,294
I always did whatever the hell I wanted!

32
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,715
I'm a wretch
that tried to kill my own father.

33
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:57,803
Just because I hit and killed a kid,
you thought I would just beg for mercy?

34
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,390
"Please forgive me?"

35
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,269
This is really the last chance.

36
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:09,523
There won't be another to correct this.
Please, tell me the truth.

37
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,446
I don't know
what you want to hear from me,

38
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,323
but it was me. I hit him!

39
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,534
So stop asking useless questions like that

40
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,290
and get me some cigarettes
if you're gonna be back.

43
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,562
I met...

44
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:34,775
Seo Young-chul.

45
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:55,921
What did Seo Young-chul tell you?

46
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,467
<i>I've always been like this.</i>

47
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:03,178
I'm a wretch
that tried to kill my own father.

48
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:08,350
Just because I hit and killed a kid,
you thought I would just beg for mercy?

49
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,729
"Please forgive me?"

50
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:22,406
That he will apologize...
as many times as he needs to.

51
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:27,661
That he will pay for what he's done,
even after death.

52
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,338
I thought you wouldn't
be able to meet him.

53
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:44,428
Thank you.

54
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,765
You must have been able to meet him

55
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:55,773
to hear those words
and let Joon-ho rest in peace.

56
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,410
Were you able to check the surveillance
cameras that you were going to look into?

57
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:10,704
The ones at the incident location.

58
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,211
No, not yet.

59
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:18,962
Oh...

60
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,281
Brother!

61
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:54,289
<i>Young-chul, sorry for the late text.</i>
<i>Can you send me your truck registration?</i>

62
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:57,209
-<i>I need to send it.</i>
<i>-</i>What's this... Huh?

63
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,347
My God, you're insane!

64
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,474
-Get out.
-Let go!

65
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:16,103
-Get out right now!
-I said let go!

66
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:21,233
You have a death wish, don't you?

67
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:24,736
Come on, it's raining.
There's no way anyone's out patrolling.

68
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,072
You're a cop and you don't even know that?

69
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:29,783
Pull yourself together, man!

70
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:30,993
Son of a...

71
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,540
How dare you, huh? To me?

72
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,382
Let's go then. Let's go.

-Wear your seat belt!
-Jeez, so scary.

76
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:18,415
Mr. Police Officer, I envy you.

77
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:24,004
I wanted to be one too,
but it's all messed up now.

78
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:27,174
It got all screwed up because of you.

79
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:35,933
Why do you always become like that person
whenever you get drunk?

80
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,559
You bastard.

81
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:40,562
You calling Father "that person?"
Our father?!

82
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:50,447
All right. It's all my fault. Everything.

83
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,422
Hey.

84
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,967
Bastard.

85
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:12,928
You must not know

86
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,513
how much at fault you are.

87
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,848
It's all your fault.

88
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:20,352
You made me into this!

89
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,396
Come on, enough is enough!

90
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:25,232
How long are you going to keep doing this?

91
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:29,152
Isn't 20 years of blaming me enough?
Stop it, just stop!

93
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,261
I'm so sorry.

94
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:57,139
My brother is not a person like this.

95
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,685
I'm so sorry,
but can you please show clemency?

96
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,313
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

97
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,815
No words would justify what happened.

98
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:10,819
-By the way, have we met before?
-Oh, I hear that all the time.

99
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,738
Just look. A very common face.

100
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,043
Where's Seo Hae-an?

101
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,337
-Hmm? He's on leave.
-What for?

102
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,215
What am I, a school teacher?
Why would I ask him that?

103
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,134
He's probably on a vacation!

SEO HAE-AN - BROTHER
TO THE ACCUSED SEO YOUNG-CHUL

107
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,940
I see now. I knew he looked familiar.

108
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,651
What are you doing?

109
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:57,824
-Where's Seo Hae-an's leave request form?
-What? What is it? Why so curious?

110
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:01,328
-Did he say anything about the leave?
-Like what?

111
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,413
You know, like Seo--

112
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:08,543
Never mind.

113
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:12,422
What? What's wrong with him
this early in the morning?

114
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:15,050
That person woke up?

115
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:16,885
-Yes.
-Oh, Lord.

116
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,762
How could he wake up?

117
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:20,680
Father, you said that

118
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:24,601
it is a sin to take someone's life,
or to take your own.

119
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,604
Because those that have sinned
do not deserve the blessing,

120
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,481
that that's why I can't meet them.

121
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,316
Yes, I did.

122
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,568
-Could it be that you're wrong, Father?
-Huh?

123
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:36,405
Maybe I can meet people
that killed someone.

124
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:39,574
There's no way. Absolutely not.

125
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:43,120
Seol-a's mother. You couldn't meet her.

126
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:45,872
Right...

127
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,336
Then how did this person wake up?

128
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:54,756
That's...

129
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,717
That is...

130
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,264
-You don't know, right?
-Huh?

131
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,975
-You don't know.
-That's not true.

132
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:09,062
If you don't know, please just say so.

133
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:11,815
Ah! I came for nothing, jeez.

134
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:14,818

135
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,362
Yeah, I don't know.

136
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:20,490
I have no idea
how that person could wake up.

137
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,076
How?

I don't know
what you want to hear from me,

00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:43,555
but it was me. I hit him!

143
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:47,976
Excuse me.
Is this by chance Seo Young-chul's<i>...</i>

144
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,144

<i>Noona</i>... You're here.

149
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,473
Long time no see.
What a place for a reunion.

150
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,204
Life seems so futile.

151
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:53,625
They said he woke up
after two years in a coma.

152
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:56,920
I thought he would recover soon...

153
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:01,716
I never thought he would go
as soon as he opened his eyes like that.

154
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,678
You must have been close to him.

155
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:10,517
We were co-workers,
but yes, we were pretty close.

156
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,607
That day, something really great
happened to his little brother.

157
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:23,280
He even ordered a turtle-shaped
gold necklace from the jewelers

158
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:27,534
and got off work all excited to see him.

159
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:34,291
It might be... It might be my fault.

160
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,293
Sorry?

161
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:39,713
That night... I was working overtime

162
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:46,845
and I texted Young-chul
for a picture of his vehicle registration.

163
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:53,018
His replies had a bunch of typos,
like a drunk person, but I thought,

164
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,146
"Nah, no way."

165
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:58,940
Like an idiot...

166
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:02,152
I never even began to think

167
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,779
that he would be driving.

168
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:10,910
I should have told him
just once more not to drive.

169
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:15,624
Then none of this would have happened.

170
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:22,130
The little boy that died was tragic,
but Young-chul is also unfortunate.

171
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:34,017
You drank a lot, huh.

172
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,062
Oh, <i>dongsaeng!</i>

173
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,985
<i>Dongsaeng, </i>I'm sorry.

174
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:49,074
I'm just... upset.

00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,912
So very distraught.

176
00:15:56,373 --> 00:16:00,293
Probably not as much as <i>dongsaeng</i>, but...

177
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,630
Thinking about Young-chul<i>...</i>

178
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,804
Please, don't cry.

179
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,809
He isn't worth all these tears.

180
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:33,493
<i>...and I texted Young-chul</i>
<i>for a picture of his vehicle registration.</i>

181
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:37,580
A picture?

182
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,097
Tae-hee, it's all over for real now, okay?

183
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:59,436
What's the use of resenting and hating
someone who isn't a part of this world?

184
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,354
It just makes it harder for us.

185
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:04,774
Let's move on, hmm?

186
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,860
Let us move on, Tae-hee!

187
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:13,616
Oh, right,

188
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,287
I think <i>Maehyeong </i>and Noona should
also know about this. Should I tell them?

189
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,039
<i>When was this?</i>

190
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,751
Yesterday.

191
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,545
<i>Were there no words he left behind?</i>

192
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,630
He said he was sorry.

193
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,343
That he will die
to pay for what he's done.

194
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,348
Those were his last words, I heard.

195
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,939
<i>Your mother would feel worse</i>
<i>if she knew, right?</i>

196
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:51,196
Give it some time.

197
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,073
You can tell her slowly, Dad.

198
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:58,453
<i>All right. Thanks for delivering</i>
<i>such a difficult message.</i>

199
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:03,875
<i>I hope that now Joon-ho can rest in peace.</i>

200
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:11,382
FATHER

201
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,203
You waited for me?

202
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:43,414
To drive you to work.

203
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:45,959
I could have gone alone.

204
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,212
Yesterday was probably really tough.

205
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,840
I wanted to make this
at least comfortable.

206
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:07,021
Good times, good times.

207
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,489
Sir?

208
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,243
Are you by chance
looking for A Dime A Job?

209
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:25,039
No, I'm the father
of Baek Dong-joo over there.

210
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:26,416
Excuse me?

211
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,128
Oh boy! Nice to meet you, sir!

212
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,922
Uh, who are...? Do you know my Dong-joo?

213
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,382
Of course I do!

214
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,512
Ah, right. I'm the CEO of A Dime A Job
and Kim Tae-hee's maternal uncle,

215
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,973
Vincent. Nice to meet you.

216
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,975
Vincent, I see. Hello.

217
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,978
Oh, but Dong-joo just left.

218
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,317
Why would my Dong-joo leave from here?

219
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:53,902
Huh?

220
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:55,904
-Huh?
-Huh?

221
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,822
I mean, uh... Huh?

222
00:19:58,698 --> 00:19:59,782
Here you go.

223
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,120
Why would a kid that should be studying
in Noryangjin come out of here?

224
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:09,208
I see, Dong-joo was preparing
for the civil service exam.

225
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:14,923
Oh, just now, Dong-joo was visiting
for a moment for something--

226
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,090
What thing?

227
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,052
That is, uh...

228
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:23,389
Oh, this house is known
for its good omens.

229
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:28,978
Those that have passed by this place
have been hired to civil officer positions

230
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,689
so now everyone comes by
to get the good energy.

231
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:34,609
In other words,
a popular place for all sorts for students.

232
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:38,029
-Does Dong-joo live here?
-No, not really live, but, more like...

233
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,114
stopping by. Yes.

234
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:43,493
Uh, so, she said
just being here clears up her mind,

235
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,036
or something like that.

236
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:49,666
But she's not the type to believe
something like that. She's Catholic.

237
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,084
Right. Ah...

238
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,836
Right, Dong-joo... goes to church.

239
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,509
-Sir.
-Yes.

240
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,345
Actually, there is
something you should know.

241
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:08,059
So, Dong-joo and Tae-hee...

242
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:13,439
-...have recently begun a relationship.
-Excuse me?

243
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:17,694
Therefore, inevitably,
Dong-joo has been in and out pretty...

244
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,321
<i>not, </i>often...

245
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:24,117
She just came by
to see Tae-hee this morning.

246
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:29,080
Oh, man. To be young
is a great thing. Right, sir?

247
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:31,874
Coming all the way here from Noryangjin.

248
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,460
But then again, there are plenty

249
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:37,714
that love across Seoul and Busan,
even across international seas.

250
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,674
How long have they been together?

251
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:43,219
I'm not sure. How long has it been?

252
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:45,763
Hmm. Maybe, like, a week?

253
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,058
Or was it ten days...

254
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:53,730
No, maybe it's been a month
since they really started dating.

255
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,485
Sir.

256
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:04,490
Our Tae-hee is a pretty decent guy.

257
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:06,784
So please,
you don't have to be too worried.

258
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:11,039
-Um...
-Yes? Yes, yes.

259
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:15,376
It's not that my child came here
last night and left this morning, right?

260
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,881
No, no, not at all, don't you worry!

261
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:23,760
As long as I'm with them,
anything you may be concerned about

262
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,637
will never, ever happen.

it's tragic.

he might have wanted a smoke.

that he liked before passing?

-Even I've forgotten about it.
-Is that so? That's a relief.

Oh.

I don't think so.

348
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:14,438
It tastes totally different
from the <i>kimchi jjim </i>I'm used to.

349
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:15,523
Completely different.

350
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:17,775
"Different," my ass, kid!

351
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:21,612
I added a little too much sugar earlier.
It's the same!

352
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:25,950
By the way, Dong-joo...

353
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:30,496
did you tell your father
that you and Tae-hee are together?

354
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:35,793
Are you okay?

355
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:38,754
-Drink some of this.
-Okay.

356
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:45,386
But wait, did I ever tell you that, Uncle?

357
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:47,137
You think I'm an idiot? Hmm?

358
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:49,682
Who do you think you're fooling?

359
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,393
Anyways, uh...

360
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:56,397
If your father found out,
I think he would be overjoyed.

361
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:00,859
Stop being nosy and let's just eat.

362
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:04,947
I mean, what if you're
walking down the street hand-in-hand

363
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,741
and Dong-joo's father sees that?

364
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:08,826
For--

365
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:13,581
Just eat your food.
It's our problem, what's wrong with you?

366
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:18,168
What I mean is, before something like that
happens and makes it awkward for everyone,

367
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:23,382
I'm merely suggesting that you tell him
beforehand to prevent such an event.

368
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:27,428
-Eat up, eat up.
-I'm sorry.

369
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:34,059
-But Father would be so happy to find out!
-Let's just eat, for real!

370
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:36,437
Hey, Dad.

371
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:38,314
Did you eat dinner?

372
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,399
<i>I finished eating a long time ago.</i>

373
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:43,319
-<i>How about you, kiddo?</i>
-Yep, I ate.

374
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:44,570
What did you have?

375
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:46,655
Kimchi jjim!

376
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,116
Oh, did you now?

377
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:54,580
Dong-joo, make sure you get
proper breaks from studying.

378
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:58,792
Go out once in a while.
Meet people and rest your mind.

379
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:03,631
What's gotten into you?
You used to scold me for drinking.

380
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:05,215
<i>That was because</i>

381
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:08,802
<i>you would be out drinking at night</i>
<i>all by yourself.</i>

382
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:13,057
But if someone's there to protect you,
then it's fine.

383
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:19,104
I don't drink that much anymore.
Don't worry.

384
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:24,151
<i>Hey, Dong-joo.</i>
<i>You know you can tell your dad anything.</i>

385
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:29,114
<i>If you want to drink, then drink.</i>
<i>If you want to play around, then do that.</i>

386
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:33,702
If you don't do what you want
and keep what you want to say inside,

387
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:36,413
it'll end up causing stress.

388
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:39,333
You know, right?
The source of all disease.

389
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:42,836
When I was dating your mom,
we said the same thing.

390
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,631
To be honest with each other
about everything.

391
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:48,425
There's supposed to be no secrets

392
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:50,511
<i>between two people that love each other.</i>

393
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,556
<i>Once you start hiding</i>
<i>tiny things from each other,</i>

394
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:58,435
<i>you start having a hard time</i>
<i>seeing that person because of guilt.</i>

395
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:01,647
<i>All right, Dad, get to bed soon.</i>

396
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,733
Okay. Good night, kiddo.

397
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:11,490
This fox won't fess up until the very end.

398
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:14,993
Jung-ran.

399
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:16,578
My goodness!

400
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:19,790
Our Dong-joo is apparently in love!

401
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:24,503
No wonder she wouldn't come home,

402
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,839
she was busy dating.

403
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,426
What happened to studying like I told her?

404
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:37,808
I know the person that Dong-joo is with.

405
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:41,770
He's tall and good-looking,

406
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:44,440
and well-behaved on top of that.

407
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:48,569
Hard-working, polite, and well-mannered.

408
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,363
A great man for Dong-joo.

409
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:55,451
I feel reassured and can worry less now.

410
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:59,455
Hmm, I probably should invite him over
to our house next time.

411
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,711
Should I change
the curtains to nicer ones beforehand?

412
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:10,758
Maybe I should take the opportunity
to change all of them... Nah, nah.

413
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,177
He's not even my son-in-law yet.

414
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:16,013
It would be over-the-top.

415
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:32,362
{\an8}JEON MI-YOUNG NIM

416
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,287
JEON MI-YOUNG NIM

417
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:52,508
<i>This is the photo.</i>

418
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:01,183
<i>Hello?</i>

419
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:06,063
Hello, I just had a quick question.

420
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:09,274
<i>Oh, okay. What is it?</i>

421
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:10,359
So...

422
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:15,864
You said earlier that the police said
they can't accept this as evidence.

423
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:16,990
<i>Well,</i>

424
00:35:17,074 --> 00:35:22,579
I didn't submit the photo
to the police myself, I gave it to Hae-an.

425
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,123
To Hae-an?

426
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:28,210
<i>Yes, he was graduating</i>
<i>from the Police Academy</i>

427
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,879
<i>and he's been out on cases for training,</i>

428
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:33,465
<i>so I gave him the photo</i>
<i>to submit it himself,</i>

429
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:35,926
but they told him that
it can't be used as evidence.

430
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,095
<i>-Why not?</i>
-Exactly.

431
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:41,640
Hae-an also couldn't figure that out.

432
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:48,981
<i>I just accepted it as is</i>
<i>because the police said so.</i>

433
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:53,527
I understand. Thank you.

434
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:03,203
-Oh, Owner!
-Oh, Dong-joo. Where you going?

435
00:36:03,287 --> 00:36:06,331
-Are you going for some beer, by chance?
-Oh, no, um...

436
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:09,418
Can I see your car keys for a minute?

437
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,169
Car keys?

438
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:35,777
What are you doing?

439
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,870
Dong-joo<i>.</i>

440
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:48,457
You don't even have a driver's license,
why did you...?

441
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:56,882
What's the matter?

442
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,764
To tell you the truth, I met a co-worker
of Seo Young-chul at the funeral.

443
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:09,937
About an hour before the accident,
she got this photo from him.

444
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:14,775
No matter how she looked at it,
it didn't look like the driver's seat,

445
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:18,654
so she told Hae-an about it,

446
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:22,240
and he said
that the police can't use it as evidence.

447
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:24,159
Why not?

448
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,203
We don't know.

449
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,751
There's something stuck in my mind,

450
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,212
but it's not for certain.

451
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:38,382
So I couldn't tell you.

452
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:47,933
So that's why you were all tense, hmm?

453
00:37:49,977 --> 00:37:51,561
I'll look into it tomorrow.

454
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:54,147
Don't let it bother you too much.

455
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,145
Hey. Hmm?

456
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:37,482
What's this? Why do you look so tired
when you just got back from a nice leave?

457
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,370
Seo Hae-an. Let's talk for a sec.

458
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:56,918
Hey, lift it just a little bit.
Good, keep it level.

459
00:38:57,002 --> 00:39:00,756
I'm gonna let go now, okay?
Okay, now you lift it. Lift it!

460
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,091
Hey, hey, hey! Ouch.

461
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:04,885
Kid, you gotta lift it--

462
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,511
Where'd he go?

463
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:08,638
Huh? Hey, kid!

464
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:12,809
What are you doing over there?!
Ow, ow, my back.

465
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,607
I said, what are you doing, kid!

466
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,444
Uncle. About Seo Young-chul.

467
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,780
Seo Young-chul? What about him?

468
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,907
He had no passengers at the time, right?

469
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,868
Yeah, as far as I know.

470
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:37,751
If he did, could the police not know that?

471
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:40,962
How would they not? They had
surveillance cameras and dashcams too.

472
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:43,173
Right?

473
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:47,636
Jeez, why are you
asking me that all of a sudden?

474
00:39:50,097 --> 00:39:51,098
It's nothing.

475
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:54,434
Hey, it's all over.
What's the use of thinking about it?

476
00:39:54,518 --> 00:39:57,312
Let's carry that upstairs quickly
and get some lunch.

477
00:39:57,813 --> 00:39:59,731
-Let's do it fast.
-You can eat alone.

478
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:02,192
Alone? Hey, how should I do that alo--

479
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,568
Hey! Punk!

480
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:12,536
How was your brother's funeral?

481
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:19,668
Don't you remember me?
You even gave me your witness statement.

482
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:25,048
Oh, that inspector...

483
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:27,968
That was you?

484
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:32,305
Wow, they say it's a small world, but how
could we be in the same department?

485
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:35,725
Tell me about it.

486
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:39,312
But why didn't you tell them about it?
You should have at least told the team.

487
00:40:42,566 --> 00:40:44,401
I just wanted to keep it quiet.

488
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:49,990
Having a murderer brother
is not something to be proud of.

489
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:54,327
-I didn't want to tell anyone.
-I can understand.

490
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,454
I'll keep it quiet too.

491
00:40:58,248 --> 00:40:59,249
Okay.

492
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01,626
Must have been tough
to take care of alone.

493
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:04,171
Not to mention the emotional struggles.

494
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:06,339
It's fine.

495
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:10,927
Seo Hae-an. A Hit-and-Run. Let's go.

496
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,721
Yes, sir.

497
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,681
Go ahead.

498
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:32,365
<i>Inspector, can I talk to you for a moment?</i>

499
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:43,668
You've endured well, Doctor.

500
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:50,008
-Um, Inspector...
-Yes.

501
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,635
At the time of the accident,

502
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,680
was there no one else
in Seo Young-chul's car?

503
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:58,892
No, there wasn't. But why?

504
00:42:03,063 --> 00:42:05,315
Then the dashcam didn't have anything.

505
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:07,525
Well, the truck didn't have one.

506
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:12,364
It didn't?

507
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:18,787
At the time, the memory chip was removed
for a different, car-theft incident.

508
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:22,749
We have verified
that information on our end.

509
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:26,002
Then there is no evidence
that there were no other passengers.

510
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:28,463
The request has been made to recover

511
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:31,216
the surveillance camera footage
you asked for.

512
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:35,428
Not sure how long it'll take,
but we'll get a call soon.

513
00:42:36,263 --> 00:42:39,266
I'll give you a call
as soon as they contact us, Doctor.

514
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:41,226
Thank you.

515
00:42:49,693 --> 00:42:50,694
Hey there.

516
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:57,158
Hey.

517
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,005
Did the funeral go well?

518
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:13,758
Yes.

519
00:43:18,305 --> 00:43:19,472
Hey, Hae-an?

520
00:43:22,017 --> 00:43:26,187
Have you by chance seen the surveillance
camera footage on the day of the accident?

521
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:28,732
Surveillance camera?

522
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:32,152
Yes, at the witness statement.

523
00:43:33,737 --> 00:43:38,283
Did you see any other passengers in
the truck? Or see someone get out of it.

524
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:43,246
Passengers? There weren't any.

525
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:48,585
There is no way since he didn't call
for a designated driver or anything.

526
00:43:49,336 --> 00:43:51,796
It was just my brother
and Joon-ho, two people.

527
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:54,966
I see.

528
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:59,721
But, why?

529
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:06,227
Your brother might not be
the real culprit.

530
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:14,569
Wha... What do you mean by that?

531
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,074
Was there new evidence?
Or did they find a witness?

532
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:22,410
Nothing like that,
but I just have a weird feeling.

533
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:27,832
Hey, Hae-an?

534
00:44:32,045 --> 00:44:33,588
Can you help me out?

535
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:36,758
With what?

536
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:40,428
-Can I see the case files?
-What?

537
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:42,972
I thought maybe there's
some kind of a clue there.

538
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:47,435
You're in traffic incident investigations.
Shouldn't you be able to see them?

539
00:44:48,937 --> 00:44:50,605
Of course I can.

540
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:54,442
But I'm not really allowed
to show them to anyone.

541
00:44:55,402 --> 00:44:56,945
I have my own reasons,

542
00:44:58,822 --> 00:45:00,907
but if there is a real culprit out there,

543
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:04,577
your brother needs to clear his name too.

544
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:10,667
Right...

545
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:14,254
If there is one.

546
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:20,051
If I can clear his name, I should!

547
00:45:20,844 --> 00:45:22,262
Okay, I'll look into it.

548
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:47,120

Sir...

555
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,348
Please help me...

556
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:06,986
Brother...

557
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:16,931
We'll wrap up the witness statement after
watching the surveillance camera footage.

558
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,015
You may go home.

559
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:20,643
Okay.

560
00:50:21,394 --> 00:50:23,563
Let's see, the footage...

561
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:29,360
There isn't much to see
because it's a 360-degree camera, but...

562
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:34,240
Yes, yes. We'll be on our way.

563
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:36,868
Look at the kid run.

564
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,330
-Inspector Seol.
-Yes, sir.

565
00:50:41,414 --> 00:50:44,000
When this is done,
come to Bongsu intersection right away.

566
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,460
Okay, I'll be there.

567
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:47,545
-Good work.
-Thank you.

568
00:50:51,424 --> 00:50:53,134
Nothing else to state, right?

569
00:50:54,594 --> 00:50:55,595
Right.

570
00:50:56,179 --> 00:50:57,263
You may leave now.

571
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:00,850
Okay.

572
00:51:04,854 --> 00:51:05,897
Thanks for your time.

YES

00:52:03,955 --> 00:52:06,040
Wow, on the first day?

577
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:08,626
Let's go.

578
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:11,045
Huh? Where?

579
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:12,505
Just come for now.

580
00:52:13,923 --> 00:52:14,924
Yes, sir.

581
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:36,779
It's fine.

582
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,323
I deleted it.

583
00:52:41,868 --> 00:52:42,910
It's gone.

584
00:53:16,277 --> 00:53:20,406

589
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:30,017
Seo Hae-an, for the Hit-and-Run in front
of the cathedral a couple days ago,

590
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:33,312
go watch the cathedral's surveillance
footage with their cooperation.

591
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:35,856
Yes, sir.

592
00:54:55,418 --> 00:54:57,336
Have some of these while you work.

593
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:59,714
Goodness, you prepared these for me?

594
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:02,341
Thank you.

595
00:55:02,425 --> 00:55:04,468
It's a little noisy outside, right?

596
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:06,762
Our cathedral is a bit aged,

597
00:55:06,846 --> 00:55:09,682
so we are planning to refurbish
the main sanctuary next week.

598
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:12,435
The inspection is taking up
all our attention.

599
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:13,519
It's all good.

600
00:55:13,853 --> 00:55:15,187
-Enjoy.
-Yes, thank you.

601
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:21,277
I have checked all the footage,
so there will be a call from us soon.

602
00:55:40,463 --> 00:55:43,174
I thought you weren't coming back
after you left angry.

603
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:44,967
When did I do that?

604
00:55:45,051 --> 00:55:46,052
Hmm.

605
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:48,345
-Are you sulking?
-Yes.

606
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:51,515
Oh, come on, look at me, Father.

607
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:52,600
No.

608
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:55,352
-Look at me!
-Just tell me, sister.

609
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:57,688
-I must ask you something.
-What is it?

610
00:55:58,314 --> 00:56:00,399
Okay, fine. He woke up,

611
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:03,235
and he also asked me for a favor.

612
00:56:03,319 --> 00:56:07,198
Favor? What kind of favor?
You didn't tell me any of this that day.

613
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:09,700
Oh, I was a bit out of it that day.

614
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:13,454
Anyways, he asked me to deliver a message.

615
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:17,792
But none of that is important.

616
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:23,964
I think you were right, Father.

617
00:56:26,634 --> 00:56:31,097
<i>The photo submitted by Seo Young-chul's</i>
<i>little brother, why was it not accepted?</i>

618
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,890
What photo?

619
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:40,856
This one.

620
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:45,152
What is this?
I've never seen this photo before.

621
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:49,657
This was submitted by his little brother?

622
00:56:53,661 --> 00:56:57,123
I suspect that...
Seo Young-chul is not the real culprit.

623
00:56:57,206 --> 00:57:00,000
Huh? Then there is
someone else that did it?

624
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:06,006
I think, that day, Seo Young-chul was in
the passenger seat, not the driver seat.

625
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:12,179
But there's no dashcam
or surveillance footage.

626
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:16,684
-I think it's someone I know that did it.
-Who is that?

627
00:57:18,394 --> 00:57:19,395
Who is it?

628
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:21,272
Oh, come on, tell me!

629
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:24,567
I'll tell you when I'm certain of it.
-Hmm.

630
00:57:25,234 --> 00:57:26,902
You're sulking again?

631
00:57:29,822 --> 00:57:33,617
Here. I brought it because I thought
he might have wanted a smoke.

632
00:57:33,701 --> 00:57:37,538
How did you know the cigarette brand
that he liked before passing?

633
00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:40,666
Is that so? That's a relief.

Goodness...

639
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:43,646
Goodness.
Your body and your heart work together.

640
00:58:44,313 --> 00:58:47,149
You worry too much.

641
00:58:48,317 --> 00:58:50,986
I want to be a police officer.

642
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:55,991
I want to be stronger
and catch all the bad guys.

643
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:59,703
I'm also going to catch
everyone who's mean to you.

644
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:05,918
Sure. Come here.

645
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:07,836
Lie down.

646
00:59:09,255 --> 00:59:10,256
Jeez.

647
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:12,049
Now, sleep.

648
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:14,093
After you wake up,

649
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:18,138
your headache will go away
and you'll be a police officer.

Go over there, go.

658
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:06,353
I wonder how
you just suddenly got knocked up?

659
01:00:06,437 --> 01:00:08,147
You don't know, huh?

660
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:12,443
Why must you say such terrible things
whenever you drink?

661
01:00:13,152 --> 01:00:17,239
How many bloody tears must you see
from your child's eyes?

662
01:00:17,323 --> 01:00:21,327
Die, you whore!

663
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,874
Was it Yoon-shik from the oil shop?
Or that raccoon Dong-ho?

Say it, bitch!

666
01:00:32,588 --> 01:00:33,589
Listen to me.

667
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:36,925
I'm not the father of that brat.

668
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:40,012
I ain't it!

669
01:00:40,095 --> 01:00:42,473

670
01:00:43,432 --> 01:00:44,433
Do you know it?!

671
01:01:03,452 --> 01:01:07,081
It's your fault. It's all because of you!

672
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:10,834
You made this happen. You!

673
01:01:10,918 --> 01:01:13,587
I'm so sorry!

674
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,422
Bastards like you need to die.

675
01:01:16,632 --> 01:01:19,593
I'll kill you and kill myself.
I'll kill everybody!

01:01:21,303 --> 01:01:23,597
-Stop!
-Brother!

677
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,681
What?

678
01:01:24,973 --> 01:01:28,227
-My kid's not supposed to do this!
-Stop, please stop!

679
01:02:05,848 --> 01:02:08,434
I looked more closely
and found something weird.

680
01:02:08,851 --> 01:02:09,852

Yes, I must have.

685
01:03:11,663 --> 01:03:14,875
I called earlier today.
I had something to ask.

686
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:18,754
What is it? Ask away.

687
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:25,302
Uh...

688
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:31,183
Can I ask you something first?

689
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:34,061
Huh?

690
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:39,816
The cigarette brand
that my brother used to smoke...

691
01:03:42,444 --> 01:03:46,156
How did you know what it was, Dong-joo?

692
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:55,332
You can tell me, I'm just curious.

693
01:03:56,291 --> 01:04:00,254
Aren't I close enough to you
to know, no? Am I not?

694
01:04:02,923 --> 01:04:05,842
I'm saying
I'll believe whatever you tell me.

695
01:04:05,926 --> 01:04:08,428
Everything you say is all good with me--

696
01:04:32,995 --> 01:04:34,329
Come on.

697
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,418
You can tell me.

698
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:52,222
I met...

699
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:55,058
your brother.

700
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:41,438
Stop joking around and tell me the truth.

701
01:05:44,066 --> 01:05:45,859
How the hell did you find out?!

702
01:06:11,009 --> 01:06:13,970
MAY I HELP YOU?

703
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,734
{\an8}Dong-joo, what's wrong? Are you okay?

704
01:06:28,276 --> 01:06:29,444
{\an8}<i>Seo Hae-an!</i>

705
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,322
{\an8}<i>I'm here to deliver a message.</i>

706
01:06:32,406 --> 01:06:35,325
{\an8}<i>Dong-joo, I'm sorry. It's all over.</i>

707
01:06:35,409 --> 01:06:38,995
{\an8}<i>Those hands of yours,</i>
<i>do you still not consider them a gift?</i>

708
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:40,997
{\an8}<i>You better not die, Seo Hae-an.</i>

709
01:06:41,415 --> 01:06:44,418
{\an8}<i>I just wanted to live like everyone else.</i>
