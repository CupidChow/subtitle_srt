1
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,041
{\an8}Jeez.

2
00:00:59,185 --> 00:01:02,772
{\an8}A DIME A JOB

3
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:14,617
Why'd you kill me?

4
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,634
Tae-hee?

5
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,803
He's sleeping.

6
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:38,474
I fed him kimchi stew with pork leg broth.

7
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,184
And he fell asleep after.

8
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,271
He has nothing to worry about nowadays.

9
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,315
<i>You think I don't know him?</i>

10
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,319
<i>You don't think I know</i>
<i>the person I gave birth to?</i>

11
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:55,908
Just because you gave birth to him
doesn't mean you know everything.

12
00:01:56,492 --> 00:01:57,576
<i>I do know everything.</i>

13
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,620
<i>It's my karma.</i>

14
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,209
It was an accident.

15
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:07,503
Okay?

16
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,839
Don't ever forget.

17
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,882
It was an accident.

Joon-ho.

Joon-ho!

23
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,872
Wake up, please.

24
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,418
You should stop now.

25
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:49,420
Hold up.

26
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:09,148
Joon-ho. Goodness.

27
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:22,661

{\an8}KIM JOON-HO
ADMISSION OCT. 10TH 11:00 A.M.

32
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:13,212
Is this your first coffining
since you were an intern?

33
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,505
Yes, sir.

34
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,048
-Thank you.
-Sure.

35
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,303
Let's see.

36
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,141
Well…

37
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:29,979
I'm sorry…

38
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,023
These are the most difficult…

39
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,859
Clients to send off.

40
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,487
Who is it?

41
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,241
A little boy.

42
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,038

00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,297
That's right next to my house.

45
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,342
We could've passed by each other.

46
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:14,606
You try doing the finishing touches.

47
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:17,359
Yes, sir. I'll do my best.

50
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:53,789
Hey.

51
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,210
What's wrong?

52
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:06,718
Where am I?

53
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,516
My ring.

54
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:13,642
I forgot my ring.

55
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,070
Why isn't the door opening?

56
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:29,867
I have to go.

57
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:35,539
My ring.

58
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,666
Hey.

59
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,127
Can you open the door?

60
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,463
I left my ring in front of Bongsu Market.

61
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,966
Hey.

62
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,551
Can you open the door?

63
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:48,760
Hey!

64
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:53,599
Hey!

65
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:59,938
Open the door for me, please! Hey!

66
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,691
<i>Hey!</i>

67
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:05,277
<i>Hey!</i>

68
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,697
<i>-Dong-joo.</i>
<i>-Hey!</i>

69
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,158
<i>Hey!</i>

70
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:13,577
Dong-joo.

71
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,706
Dong-joo.

72
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:38,894
Dong-joo.

73
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,854
Open the door.

74
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:42,940
Dong-joo.

75
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,902
-Open the door. What's wrong?
<i>-My ring.</i>

76
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,613
I left my ring at Bongsu Market.

77
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:51,365
Dong-joo.

78
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,959
BONGSU MARKET

BONGSU MARKET
0.75 MI

80
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,219
Dong-joo.

81
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,929
Where are you going? Dong-joo!

82
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,685
Dong-joo! Where are you going?

83
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,104
Hey, Dong-joo!

84
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:25,107
Dong-joo!

85
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,360
Jeez. Dong-joo!

86
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:31,446
Honey…

87
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,824
What should I do with her?

88
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,425
BONGSU MARKET

89
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,927
<i>I left my ring in front of Bongsu Market.</i>

90
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:29,546
That makes no sense.

91
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,174
There's no way it's really here.

92
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:10,522
"79-3 Myeongbyeong-ro."
That's right next to my house.

93
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,650
We could've passed by each other.

94
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,734
79-9 MYEONGBYEONG-RO

95
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,086
79-1 TO 7 MYEONGBYEONG-RO

96
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:08,538
Who are you?

97
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:15,212
-Are you looking for someone?
-A little boy.

98
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:20,842
Well, did a little boy live here?

99
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,427
Uh…

100
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,721
He's ten years old.

101
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,933
He's about this tall.

102
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:32,854
He has big eyes with chestnut-shaped hair.

103
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:35,315
He's a bit tanned.

104
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,444
-His family all left.
-What?

105
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,571
They moved a couple days ago.

106
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,952
Do you know where?

107
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,996
Well, I think it's somewhere
in the countryside.

108
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:51,748
I'm not too sure.

109
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,340
Do you have their phone number?

110
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,262
Well…

111
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:07,389
I'm not a strange person.

112
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:13,603
I have something to give them.

113
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,991
<i>The number you have dialed</i>
<i>is no longer in service.</i>

114
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:27,909
They changed their number.

115
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,710
Here you go!

116
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,714
Hey, what's with the long face?

117
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:28,678
Apple Mom's husband is safely back
and you've cleared the mission.

118
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,264
Because

119
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,475
I'm going to get fired.

120
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:34,643
Why?

121
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:36,603
That guy.

122
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:40,649
He said he's going to tell my team leader
everything once the chief mourner returns.

123
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,442
Once he tells the team leader,

124
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,027
I'll get fired.

125
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:46,988
But it's fine.

126
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,282
I wasn't fond of this job anyway.

127
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:53,244
I'm getting fired, not quitting.
There's nothing I can do.

128
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:57,749
I'll stop deceiving my dad
and actually study for the examination.

129
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,459
It's for the best.

130
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,801
So what's with that long face then?

131
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:12,889
That boy.

132
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:15,809
My first client, the kid.

133
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,020
I couldn't finish that job.

134
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,360
It's fine. You've tried your best.

135
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:29,406
You asked around his friends
and waited in front of his school.

136
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:33,535
You even went to the community center
and the moving companies.

137
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:35,578
It was just bad timing.

138
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,664
It just wasn't the right time.

139
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,749
-"The right time"?
-Yes.

140
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,961
There was only one chance.

141
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:44,838
And I missed it.

142
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,219
Dong-joo.

143
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:52,929
God

144
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,390
will definitely help you.

145
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:57,851
I'm a 100% sure, no 200%.

146
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:58,935
No matter what.

147
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,230
Just like how He parted the Red Sea.

148
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:06,901
He's going to open up your path too.

149
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:09,404
Majestically.

150
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,823
And I'll walk on through that road.

151
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,742
But what if it's a dead end?

152
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,035
What should we do with you?

153
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:17,996
This is why we don't get along.

154
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,707
Leave after that drink. Jeez.

155
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,174
YOU'RE JUST GONNA LEAVE?

156
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,135
Do you want some odolbbyeo?

157
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,769
<i>I have 100,000,000 won.</i>

158
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:44,147
I'm going to give it
to my wife on our anniversary.

159
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,858
Suk-chul asked me
to find the money and give it to her.

160
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,778
I met with the wife and talked with her.

161
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:53,323
She said that the husband will find her.
She even mentioned Tteng-sam-i's bridge…

162
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,407
No!

163
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:56,618
Let go.

164
00:17:58,453 --> 00:17:59,579
Gang.

165
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:00,747
Wake up.

166
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,915
I see ghosts.

167
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,042
I'm serious.
They wake up when I touch them.

168
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:27,774
Excuse me?

169
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:30,568
Baek Dong-joo.

170
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:39,577
When did you start working?

171
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:43,414
You said you got
your third paycheck last time.

172
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:44,749
Has it been three months?

173
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,002
Jeez.

174
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:50,338
You said they wake up
by the touch of your hands.

175
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:51,631
And if you don't?

176
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,550
What happens if you don't touch them?

177
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:54,843
Is it just in the coffin room?

178
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,553
Or does it happen regularly?

179
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,514
Do you see anything right now?

180
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,015
Jeez.

181
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:05,520
-Do you see anything--
-What do you want to hear?

182
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,564
You're right.

183
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,524
I see ghosts. Are you satisfied?

184
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:11,901
How many did you meet?

185
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:16,030
How about the other funeral directors?
Does your team leader know?

186
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:19,325
-Baek Dong-joo.
-Jeez. Enough with Baek Dong-joo!

187
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,996
Just go tell my team leader then!

188
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:26,165
Never mind. I'll go tell him.

189
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:30,587
I'll tell him that I'll quit.
So stop bothering me.

190
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:36,217
I'll tell him tomorrow! Tomorrow!

191
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:40,638
EPISODE 5
MISUNDERSTANDING AND PREJUDICE

192
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,286
<i>Never mind</i>.

193
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:07,040
I'll tell him that I'll quit.

194
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,542
So stop bothering me, okay?

195
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:15,214
I'll tell him tomorrow! Tomorrow!

196
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,603
I must've been crazy.

197
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:34,901
Why did I do that?

198
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,280
What should I do now?

199
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,214
FULL-OPTION DORMITORY
SUCCESS IS THE MOTHER OF FAILURE

200
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:58,257
NO PARKING

201
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:05,056
That is serious. How can there be a rat?

202
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:08,977
It won't fall on my face, right?

203
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,396
I heard that happened

204
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:14,524
to my aunt when she was in elementary.
She's over 60 years old.

205
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,610
Whoa. Yes, I could totally
see that happening there.

206
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:20,571
You shouldn't have left
the previous place.

207
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:24,200
I don't know what's going on,
but isn't it better to go back?

208
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:28,121
It's better than worrying
about a rat falling on your face.

209
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:32,333
There's something worse
than a rat at that place.

210
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,211
What's that?

211
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:39,757
Your place is so secluded
and filled with weird people.

212
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:43,511
That place has a lot of criminals.
What if you get kidnapped?

213
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:44,846
-Really?
-Yes.

214
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,475
But that's not what's important…

215
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:52,770
Team leader…

216
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,858
Honestly…

217
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:00,778
Well…

218
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,741
-I wanted to work for a long time--
-Hold up.

219
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:09,037
Yes, Team Leader Seo?

220
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,914
We're right in front.

221
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:14,834
Okay, I'll be right there.

222
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:18,004
Dong-joo, the bereaved family arrived.

223
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:19,297
Let's get ready.

224
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,923
Let's talk after work.

225
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:22,300
Let's go.

226
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,805
-Baek Dong-joo, hurry up.
-Yes, sir.

227
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:33,186
You don't have to worry about security.
There's a police officer right next door.

228
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,938
We'll come back after we look around.

229
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,107
There's no place cleaner than here.

230
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:40,651
Of course, that's right!

231
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,445
-We'll call you.
-Yes, ma'am!

232
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,380
APPOINTMENTS

233
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:03,132
I wonder why she moved out.

234
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:06,803
I wonder why she moved out so suddenly.

235
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,265
I think it's you.

236
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,727
There's nobody else.

237
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:16,562
You two fought, right?

238
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:19,690
-You and Dong-joo from the 2nd floor!
-Why are you blaming me?

239
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,944
Then why'd she leave suddenly
the same day I introduced you.

240
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,780
-Isn't it weird?
-Goodness. Hold up!

241
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,118
Is it true?

242
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,453
Did Dong-joo move out?

243
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:35,289
-Yes.
-Goodness. What's going on?

244
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:41,170
Dong-joo is like a hamburger to my fries.

245
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:44,048
I'm here, so where would she go?
This is invalid!

246
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:45,758
Stop talking nonsense.

247
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,136
I already gave back her deposit.

248
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:54,308
Already? Why, what happened?

249
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:58,729
-Something probably came up.
-What do you mean?

250
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:01,274
Dong-joo really liked this place.

251
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:04,735
She was so happy. She said she couldn't
find a better house in Seoul.

252
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:07,155
Something's definitely up!

253
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,782
Where did she go?

254
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,368
I'm heading to work.

255
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:18,291
Goodness. He doesn't even care.

256
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,294
He's so cold!

257
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,004
We're not happy either.

258
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:24,964
A vacancy is our loss too.

259
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:26,799
Goodness. You too…

260
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:31,387
You don't care
where she went and why she left?

261
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,931
It's all about the money, right?

262
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:39,270
There's nothing more beautiful
than caring and loving for neighbors.

263
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:41,397
There's nothing you can do.

264
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,817
I can.

265
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:48,154
I'll bring Dong-joo back no matter what.

266
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:49,447
How?

267
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:53,492
BAEK DONG-JOO

268
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:55,244
A DIME A JOB

269
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:07,506
BAEK DONG-JOO

00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:15,473
KIM JUN-HO'S SON KIM GEON-WOO

271
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:21,437
The mortuary is finalized.
You just have to decide on the flowers.

272
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:25,900
Take a look here.

273
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:29,570
This is commonly used
for room number three.

274
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,530
What about this?

275
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:33,574
Sure, that's common too.

276
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,535
Also, this one.

277
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:40,206
Which one is better?

278
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:42,375
For a grandma,

279
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,963
I think this one is better.
It's beautiful and cozy.

280
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:54,011
My mother-in-law really liked
yellow flowers.

281
00:25:55,930 --> 00:26:00,810
What's the one you recommended earlier?

282
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:04,563
-This one.
-Yes, we'll do this one.

283
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,899
Honey.

284
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,193
-Should we decide on this?
-Sure.

285
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:11,862
Please sign here.

286
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:15,408
I'm her daughter-in-law,
so you can talk to me from now on.

287
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:16,826
Yes, ma'am.

288
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:20,746
The mortuary will be ready…

289
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:41,392
Hello, sir.

290
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,061
Hey, long time no see.

291
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,855
Whoa. The flowers are beautiful.

292
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,025
Yes, I'm sending pictures to my daughter.

293
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,652
She should take breaks while studying.

294
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:54,196
-She's preparing for the exam, right?
-Yes.

295
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:59,744
She's studying really hard at Noryangjin.

296
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:01,787
She never comes home.

297
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,124
She said she'd visit
this weekend, but she didn't.

298
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,208
Even yesterday?

299
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,335
And the day before?

300
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,672
-That's right.
-So she's at Noryangjin right now?

301
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:16,093
You must be upset.

302
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:19,847
Yes, it does feel empty.

303
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:23,100
But what can I do? They say
there are no easy shortcuts to learning.

304
00:27:23,184 --> 00:27:24,268
Yes, you're right.

305
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:25,811
Jeez.

306
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:28,606
Do you want iced plum tea?

307
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:29,857
I made some.

308
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,942
That's okay, sir.

309
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,903
-Good seeing you.
-You too, sir.

310
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,911
I'll go tell him that I quit.

311
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,372
So quit bothering me, okay?

312
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:48,584
I'll go tell him tomorrow!

313
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:50,711
<i>Tomorrow</i>!

314
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:58,719
-Director.
-Yes?

315
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:03,224
Well, we already had Yukgaejang
for two meals today…

316
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,102
Then should I prepare
beef radish soup for dinner?

317
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:09,188
Yes, please.
Then how about for the rice cakes.

318
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:13,067
We already had Songpyeon and Jeolpyeon.
So how about Chal-tteok and Du-tteok?

319
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:14,860
That'd be great.

320
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:16,654
About the kids--

321
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:23,202
You're so considerate
thinking about the kids too.

322
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:26,705
I couldn't have done this without you.

323
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,290
No problem at all.

324
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:31,210
There's a bakery in the main building.
Should I get you some?

325
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,045
No, that's fine. I should buy it.

326
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:34,213
-No, I--
-Mom.

327
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,924
-I want pizza.
-Jeez. Be quiet.

328
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,553
Director.

329
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:43,806
Yes?

330
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:50,980
No, that's really fine.

331
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,441
I haven't seen you eat all day.

332
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,110
I should've taken care of your meals.

333
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:59,989
-No, it's really fine. I'm not hungry.
-There's no way.

334
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:03,033
I saw you starving.

335
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:06,078
-You don't have to care about me.
-Hurry and eat.

336
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,747
Please don't do this. I'll get in trouble.

337
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:13,002
Jeez. Who would scold you for eating?

338
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:14,587
Yes, that's right.

339
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:17,590
You're completely right.
Thank you for the food.

340
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:20,468
-Sure, please enjoy.
-Yes, ma'am.

341
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:24,597
Let's sit.

342
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,022
Can we eat?

343
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,649
This is the first time
something like this has happened.

344
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:37,067
This rarely happens.

345
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:41,280
Usually people don't know
who we are until the funeral admission.

346
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:43,657
Right.

347
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:46,452
EONJU UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL FUNERAL HOME

348
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,329
Dong-joo, you've contacted
the limousine driver, right?

349
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:51,207
Yes, I told him the time
and the location of Jangmoo crematorium.

350
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:52,333
Good job.

351
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,792
Oh, yeah.

352
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:55,961
What did you have to tell me?

353
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:57,046
Well…

354
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,259
I…

355
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:03,969
Jeez.

356
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:07,556
What is it?

357
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:10,434
-Team Leader, I--
-Director.

358
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,147
I'll wait for you outside.

359
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:16,273
Yes, sir.

360
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:20,694
WRIST PROTECTION BAND

361
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:24,406
I saw your wrist earlier
and thought you might need this.

362
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:26,200
I see.

363
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:29,286
I know well
because I'm a preschool teacher.

364
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,539
As I was going to the bakery,

365
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:33,999
I saw a convenience store and bought it.

366
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:36,877
Is this…

367
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:39,380
Is this really for me?

368
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:41,549
Of course.

369
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:44,843
Thank you.

370
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:49,431
Even with kids, five-year olds
and six-year-olds don't weigh the same.

371
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,850
You're making such an effort.

372
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:55,563
It must be really exhausting for you.

373
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:57,940
To take care of my mother-in-law tomorrow.

374
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:06,657
I was going to contact you…

375
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,618
I couldn't ask you
for an errand right away…

376
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:12,496
No, that's okay. It's fine.

Team Leader!

379
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:17,835
You can talk to me.

380
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:19,169
What?

381
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:20,337
Dong-joo.

382
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,464
I told you that I'd tell him.

383
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:25,801
-Tell me what?
-No--

384
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,262
-You can talk to me.
-No, you should talk to me.

385
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,723
I'll talk to him.

386
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:32,057
No, I will.

387
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:36,979
I said, I would…

388
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,399
I said, I would…

389
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,483
Why?

390
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:45,863
Why wouldn't he let me?

391
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:48,365
I don't understand.

392
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:51,118
What is it?

393
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,536
Why's he so dedicated?

394
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:54,496
Why…

395
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:56,415
Why's he doing this to me?

396
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:59,585
What did I do that was so wrong?

00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,923
RESIGNATION

398
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,177
I'm sorry, Team Leader.

399
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:11,722
I was going to tell you.

BAEK DONG-JOO FUNERAL DIRECTOR

402
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:18,479
Goodbye, sir.

403
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,078
Did something happen to Dong-joo?

404
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,789
What happened to you both?

405
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:38,082
Huh?

406
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,256
Dong-joo will tell you she will quit.

407
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:49,927
She will?

408
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:52,513
It's my fault.

409
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:57,643
I had a misunderstanding
and made a mistake.

410
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,273
It's hard to tell you in detail.

411
00:33:03,524 --> 00:33:07,528
Please tell her she can't quit
because it's all my fault.

412
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:12,324
I don't understand anything
you're saying, Tae-hee.

413
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:14,743
It's all my fault.

414
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:17,663
I apologize, sir.

415
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:20,999
Why are you apologizing to me?

416
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:26,880
I don't know
what happened between you two.

417
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,258
If you made a mistake,

418
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,635
you should apologize to Dong-joo.

419
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:39,143
Have you tried apologizing sincerely?

420
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:47,651
I don't think you should be here.

<i>The person you have dialed</i>

424
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:38,786
Yes, Vincent.

425
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,498
Really? I'll be right there.

426
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:53,967
Just somewhere…

427
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:58,180
<i>Goodness. So where is it?</i>

428
00:34:58,514 --> 00:34:59,515
Dong-joo.

429
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:02,100
Can you make time for me, please?

430
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,562
I'd like to talk to you in person.

431
00:35:05,646 --> 00:35:08,816
And have a cold iced coffee with you.

432
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:13,570
You know…

433
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:17,908
My next door unit is reserved
only for you, Dong-joo.

434
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:20,828
<i>I'm worried someone might move in.</i>

435
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:22,704
<i>-I'm just really worried.</i>
-Well.

436
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:25,541
I'm never moving back in there.

437
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:28,710
<i>Jeez. Why are you saying</i>
<i>such hurtful things?</i>

438
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:30,420
Dong-joo.

439
00:35:31,255 --> 00:35:35,008
Can you think about it
a little longer, please?

440
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:39,513
<i>If you can just do me that favor,</i>
<i>I'd really appreciate it.</i>

441
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:45,060
I lost my appetite
as soon as you moved out.

442
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:48,438
Nothing gives me an appetite.
I'm burning inside.

443
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:51,400
Goodness. Never mind.

444
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:55,112
<i>I'm talking nonsense. I don't want</i>
<i>to add any emotional pressure.</i>

445
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:56,446
Okay.

446
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,449
<i>We were living so close to each other.</i>

447
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:02,160
<i>How can you just leave without a word?</i>

448
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:04,705
<i>How can you do that?</i>

449
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:06,999
<i>Don't do this.</i>

450
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:09,877
<i>Please tell me your address.</i>

451
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,546
<i>I'll head right over.</i>

452
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:17,092
I'm at Ho-gok 2nd Street.

453
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:18,677
What?

454
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,095
Hold up.

455
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:21,305
I'm right there.

456
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:22,556
Oh, really?

457
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:24,308
Where, exactly?

458
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:28,312
Where are you?

459
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:32,274
I'm sorry, honey.

460
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,109
You must've been surprised.

461
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:38,071
Who were you talking to on the phone?
I couldn't reach you.

462
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:50,042
Shit. A cop!

463
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:53,587
Ouch. Seriously!

464
00:36:53,754 --> 00:36:56,089
-Seriously!
-You have no loyalty, leaving your friend.

465
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:59,885
Do you want to cut off smoking first
or cut off your hands first?

466
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:03,847
Goodness. You are real trouble.

467
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:04,932
Let go of me.

468
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:06,266
"Let go," my ass.

469
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:07,768
Come here.

470
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:10,103
Call Chang-wan
and tell that bastard to come.

471
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:12,481
Come here.

472
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,653
Well.

473
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:19,821
I was nearby.

474
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:22,658
I saw you when I was passing by.

475
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:27,412
I'm serious.

476
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:29,081
I was just passing by.

477
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,583

You're not staying here, are you?

481
00:37:43,637 --> 00:37:45,180
You should move somewhere else.

482
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:20,924
Where are you headed?

483
00:38:33,729 --> 00:38:34,771
Let's go.

484
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,816
The room is still empty.

485
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:41,570
Am I someone you can
just kick out and invite back in?

486
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,239
I'm sorry.

487
00:38:44,698 --> 00:38:46,074
I shouldn't have done that.

488
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:51,955
I misunderstood.

489
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:55,876

493
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,567
What did you tell my team leader?

494
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:22,444
What?

495
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:24,696
Well…

496
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:27,449
That you'd work really hard.

497
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:30,911
What the…

498
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:33,872
The bus is arriving.

499
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,376
Let's go.

500
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,295
We'll have to wait if we miss this one.

501
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:42,255
You'll catch a cold here.

502
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,591
Let's hurry.

503
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:46,218

00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,721
You have to go to work! Hurry!

505
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:53,517
Hurry, get on.

506
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,026
Did you eat dinner?

507
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,780
-Yes.
-I see.

508
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:54,077
I'm a bit hungry.
Should we have udon before we head home?

509
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:55,328
No.

510
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:00,959
What did you have for dinner?

511
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:02,836
Can we just go quietly?

512
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,674

00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:36,953
Goodness. She's always overthinking.

516
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:43,835

Why don't you pick up your calls?

522
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:29,631
I thought you changed your number.

523
00:42:32,926 --> 00:42:34,552
You still use the same number.

524
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:37,222
My number's still the same too.

525
00:42:43,103 --> 00:42:44,104
What do you want?

526
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:48,441
Il-seob, can you lend me 300,000 won?

527
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:52,237
My baby's sick.

528
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:54,406
I have to take her to the hospital.

529
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:08,670
Give it to me.

530
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:26,563
<i>I'll tell him tomorrow!</i>

531
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:27,689
Tomorrow!

532
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:33,695
Can you just answer me this?

533
00:43:34,154 --> 00:43:35,447
Have you met a kid before?

534
00:43:45,165 --> 00:43:46,207
I'm sorry.

535
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,919
I think you're right.

536
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,592
I wondered where Tteng-sam-i bridge is.

537
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:57,552
So I went to the Incheon bridge.

538
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:02,015
I met the husband,

539
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:04,142
and I had a realization.

540
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,228
I don't believe you.

541
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:10,023
I believe you, Dong-joo.

542
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:13,610
Sincerely.

543
00:44:18,448 --> 00:44:19,449
You finally realized?

544
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,754
Did you say you went
to the Incheon bridge?

545
00:44:35,507 --> 00:44:36,508
Did I?

546
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:38,343
Didn't you?

547
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,679
You don't remember?

548
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:44,974
I do.

549
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,226
I don't think so.

550
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:51,689
Did you drink?

551
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:55,068
I did just a little bit.

552
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:57,946
That's not important.

553
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:01,282
Why'd you go to the Incheon bridge?

554
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:08,581
Because I couldn't stop thinking…

555
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:10,583
Thinking about what?

556
00:45:14,421 --> 00:45:16,381
You said you couldn't hear because of me.

557
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,593
I had to go.

559
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:32,689

Excuse me? Do you have more of these?

Sir.

570
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:22,734
Sir, look at me.

571
00:48:27,697 --> 00:48:28,865
Sir, look at me now.

572
00:48:32,702 --> 00:48:33,953
Sir.

573
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:37,832
Can you get up?

574
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,251
Sir, get up.

575
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,003
Please stand up.

00:48:45,048 --> 00:48:46,507
-Let me help you.
-Okay.

577
00:48:49,344 --> 00:48:50,928
Sir, try walking.

578
00:48:58,686 --> 00:48:59,979
Can you call 911?

579
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:04,776
Yes, that's right. We're on the bridge
in front of the intersection.

580
00:49:05,777 --> 00:49:07,403
Yes, it's above the post office.

Please get here quickly.

-Are you a doctor?
-Yes.

-You must go fast.

00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:33,429
Here you go.

588
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:36,891
Thank you for earlier.

589
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:39,143
No, I didn't really do anything.

590
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:41,104
You called 911 fast.

591
00:49:41,521 --> 00:49:43,606
It would've been worse
if it weren't for you.

00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:22,603
{\an8}I wonder if you slept well.

597
00:50:23,396 --> 00:50:24,731
{\an8}It's none of your business.

598
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:27,358
Can I be in your business?

599
00:50:27,567 --> 00:50:28,609
We're neighbors.

600
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:32,697
I slept well.

601
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:37,452
{\an8}-What are the flowers for?
-They're a gift.

602
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:38,703

603
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:42,665

615
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:04,121
You're so considerate.

616
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:07,542
I've met an angel on my way.

617
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:11,045
-No problem at all.
-How pretty.

618
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:13,714
Thank you.

619
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:17,051
My daughter-in-law
is really caring, isn't she?

620
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,761
Yes.

621
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:21,722
She was like a daughter to me.

622
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:24,267
Thanks to her,

623
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,478
I received such a lovely gift on my way.

624
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:32,191
Is there anything else I can do for you?

625
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:34,485
Goodness. This is enough.

626
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:37,947
I couldn't go empty-handed

627
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:40,825

628
00:52:41,826 --> 00:52:44,036
Can I give this to my mother?

629
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,371
Yes, of course.

630
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:49,709
I can imagine her smiling face.

631
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:54,171
I really missed my mother.

632
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,967
Now that I'm seeing her,

633
00:52:58,551 --> 00:52:59,927
it's like a dream come true.

634
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:04,932
I'm going to ask my mother for a warm hug.

635
00:53:05,892 --> 00:53:09,145
I'm going to take a nap
in my mother's arms.

636
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,733
I wonder if she'll be waiting
for me in floral shoes.

637
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:17,069
Or if she'll be wearing
a pink silk jacket.

638
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:20,990
I wonder if she'll say,
"When did you age so much?"

639
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:24,076
or, "When did you get those wrinkles?"

640
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,845
-Director.
-Yes.

641
00:53:44,597 --> 00:53:46,223

No problem.

645
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:55,107
Her last moments

646
00:53:55,775 --> 00:53:57,485
looked really peaceful.

647
00:53:59,779 --> 00:54:01,989
You've done more
than a family could ever do.

648
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:04,283
I don't know how to thank you.

649
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:08,245
The flowers were really beautiful.

650
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,836
You even decorated
her casket with yellow flowers.

651
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,922
I was really touched.

652
00:54:20,049 --> 00:54:25,221
-I heard you used your own money. I--
-No, not at all. It's fine.

653
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:28,140
I wanted to do it for her.

654
00:54:28,641 --> 00:54:29,892
I just followed my heart.

655
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:31,686
Goodness.

656
00:54:32,228 --> 00:54:33,980
I think I'm really blessed

657
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:35,815
to have met you.

658
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,444
Wait a minute.

659
00:54:45,992 --> 00:54:48,953
These are some of the flowers
I gave your mother-in-law.

660
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:51,998
There were some left over,
so I wanted to give them to you.

661
00:54:55,668 --> 00:54:56,794
You didn't have to.

662
00:54:57,128 --> 00:54:59,630
You really don't have to care for me.

663
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:01,257
Take it.

664
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:11,684
Thank you.

665
00:55:13,269 --> 00:55:14,270
No problem.

666
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:28,701
Nice work, Dong-joo.

667
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:32,538
It's been weighing
on your mind a lot, right?

668
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:35,875
Yes.

669
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:16,499
I saw Kim Tae-hee's doppelganger
at the funeral home earlier.

670
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:18,709
-The errand-running company?
-Yes.

671
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:20,044
That's him.

672
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:21,962
-He started working there.
-Really?

673
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:23,589
-He's not coming back?
-Hey.

674
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:26,217
He turned in his resignation and went
to the army. Do you think he would?

675
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,384
I thought he would.

676
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:29,678
Do you think he has still not recovered?

677
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:31,388
I don't think he ever will.

678
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:35,768
But that's not his fault.
Why does he think he killed him?

679
00:56:36,644 --> 00:56:39,605
You know, he was going
to propose to Chung-ha that day.

680
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:41,107
Really?

681
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:51,826
Are you all right?

682
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:54,954
Goodness. I'm so sorry.

683
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:56,831
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

684
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:58,249
Goodness.

685
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:00,376
Sun Il-woo!

686
00:57:04,797 --> 00:57:07,383
-I'm sorry. I should've been more careful.
-No, it's fine.

687
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:09,510
My kid fools around too much.

688
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:11,554
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's okay.

689
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:15,850
The pizza is here
for the kids. I should go. Let's go.

690
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:27,319
I told you not to touch her hands.

691
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:28,904
I told you not to.

692
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:30,197
They're dirty.

693
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:31,782
Why are they dirty?

694
00:57:31,866 --> 00:57:34,493
Because she always touches dead people.

695
00:57:34,577 --> 00:57:36,370
Dead people are dirty?

696
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:38,414
What? Yes.

697
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:40,082
They're really dirty.

698
00:57:40,749 --> 00:57:43,210
Don't ever touch her hands.

699
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,462
-They're dirty.
-Okay.

700
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:51,510
-Why are you trashing it?
-It's dirty.

701
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,813
-You got here so quick.
-Whoa, it's pizza!

702
00:58:02,897 --> 00:58:03,939
It looks delicious.

703
00:58:09,737 --> 00:58:10,821
You left this.

704
00:58:11,447 --> 00:58:13,574
She threw them away.

705
00:58:13,741 --> 00:58:14,742
It's dirty.

706
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:16,619
Stop it!

707
00:58:17,036 --> 00:58:18,245
Dad.

708
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,415
Grandma is dirty, right?

709
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:23,751
What? Who said that?

710
00:58:23,918 --> 00:58:25,002
Mom.

711
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:27,588
Grandma is dirty
because she's dead, right?

712
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:29,006
Goodness.

713
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:32,134
-What's he saying?
-What is she telling the kid?

714
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,140
Honey.

715
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:42,061
That's not it…

716
00:59:24,228 --> 00:59:25,521
Dong-joo.

717
00:59:44,707 --> 00:59:46,083
What about this one?

718
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:48,002
That one is popular too.

719
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:53,173
-Hurry and eat.
-Don't do this. I'll get in trouble.

720
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:59,763
Jeez. Who'd scold you for eating?

721
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:29,626
-Are you off work?
-Yes.

722
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:41,805
Don't you want samgyupsal?

723
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:47,311
I have to leave early tomorrow.

724
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:49,313
We have to take the body to the cemetery.

725
01:00:49,772 --> 01:00:52,107
I see. Then,
what about black bean noodles?

726
01:00:58,489 --> 01:00:59,573
I want to be alone.

727
01:01:02,201 --> 01:01:03,202
Okay.

728
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:13,379
I won't bother you.

729
01:01:15,798 --> 01:01:16,924
Let's go home together.

730

731
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:34,691
Let's go.

732
01:01:39,113 --> 01:01:40,155
Hold on to me.

733
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:51,875
Hold on to me tightly.

734
01:01:56,797 --> 01:01:58,298
Hold on to me tightly, okay?

735
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:01,260
Let's go now.

736
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:30,891
Thank you.

A DIME A JOB

738
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:42,486
Dong-joo.

739
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:00,754
They're pretty.

740
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,013
They're great.

741
01:04:12,224 --> 01:04:13,225
Your hands.

742
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:51,573
{\an8}<i>Did we sleep together?</i>

743
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:55,994
{\an8}<i>It's not time for you to be giggling.</i>

744
01:05:56,078 --> 01:05:58,455
{\an8}<i>Where were you</i>
<i>and what were you doing, not coming home?</i>

745
01:05:58,538 --> 01:06:00,207
{\an8}<i>Should just the two of us watch it?</i>

746
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,792
{\an8}<i>I don't think this is the right way.</i>

747
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:03,752
{\an8}<i>My dad's at Noryangjin right now!</i>

748
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:05,295
{\an8}<i>Fast and accurately!</i>
<i>Perfect and meticulously!</i>

749
01:06:05,671 --> 01:06:06,922
{\an8}<i>-What should we do?</i>
<i>-How would I know?</i>

750
01:06:07,005 --> 01:06:08,090
Dong-joo.

751
01:06:09,049 --> 01:06:10,175
What the…?

752
01:06:10,258 --> 01:06:11,677
Aren't you…
