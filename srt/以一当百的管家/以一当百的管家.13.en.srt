Yes?

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,701
Well…

00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:18,829
If…

9
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,084
If Seo Young-chul wakes up,
could you let me know?

10
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:25,878
Excuse me?

11
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:28,589
Well, that'd be hard.

12
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:31,884
There's something I need to tell him.

13
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:35,638
Please.

14
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,350

-Give me the car keys.
-Car keys?

for about 10 minutes to see him.

00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:25,706
-Okay.
-Okay.

29
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,458

00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,468
Why are you here?

43
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,365
He's the kid your brother had killed.

44
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,497
He's my younger brother.

45
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,504
What do you mean your younger brother?

46
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,673

He lived with his grandma for a long time.

Hey! Where have you been?

59
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:28,574
We didn't have any errands today.

60
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,619
What's wrong?

61
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,413
Did something happen?

62
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:36,498
Did you and Dong-joo fight?

63
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,209

Jeez.

67
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:14,786
So you're saying,

68
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:19,708
Seo Young-chul is your older brother?

69
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,419
Yes.

70
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:23,795
Jeez.

71
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:32,554
You asked him yourself

72
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,224
why he's wasting energy
on useless things, right?

73
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,643
That's all because of your older brother.

74
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,394
When that happened, out of the blue,

75
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:42,439
our whole family
was scattered and devastated.

76
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,191
You saw for yourself, right?

77
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,193
My older sister, brother-in-law,
and his whole family…

78
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,570
We couldn't see each other for two years!

79
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,616
I'm sorry.

80
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:54,534
I'm so sorry.

81
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,161
I…

82
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,289
I have nothing to say.

83
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,542
I felt so bad for the kid.

84
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,255
I wanted to go to his funeral

85
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:09,049
and ask for forgiveness.

86
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,302
I really wanted to…

87
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:13,971
I…

88
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:15,931
I didn't have the courage.

89
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,768
I felt too shameless to even go there.

90
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,319
I should've have let him go that day.

91
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:31,989
Then,

92
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:34,908
that wouldn't have happened to the kid.

93
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,577
I'm at fault.

94
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:38,662
What?

95
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,747
On the day of the accident,

96
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,041
you were with Seo Young-chul?

97
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,169
Yes.

98
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,008
Tell me.

99
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,345
Tell me everything in detail…

100
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,559
about what happened from the start.

101
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,568
2020 POLICE OFFICER RECRUITMENT

102
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:10,902
Here look at this.

103
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:16,700
Jeez. Stop bragging about it so much.
It's not something to brag about.

104
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:20,120
I'm just happy to see my younger brother
become a police officer.

105
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,706
People are rude because of the fact
that I do labor work.

106
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,417
Jeez. Why would anyone do that?

107
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,461
If people find out

108
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:31,214
that I caught a hit-and-run culprit,
everyone will be surprised.

109
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,799
Goodness. You did?

110
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,259
It's not a big deal.

111
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:37,346
At the Iam Intersection,

112
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,348
there was a hit-and-run on a old lady.

113
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:42,392
And I caught him during my training.

114
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,394
Whoa! Goodness!

115
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:47,230
The chief wants

116
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:50,192
to reward me for it
after my training is over.

117
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,903
What for?

118
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,113
We should throw a big party!

119
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:03,372
-Yes?
<i>-This is the Joong-ang Police Academy.</i>

120
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,165
<i>Is this Seo Hae-an trainee?</i>

121
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,125
Yes, this is he.

122
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:11,546
<i>You've been chosen to represent your class</i>
<i>at the graduation ceremony next week.</i>

123
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:14,758
Excuse me?

124
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,428
-Me?
<i>-Please check in the day before</i>

125
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:19,679
<i>for the rehearsal.</i>

126
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:21,139
Rehearsal?

127
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,767
You're telling me
to come in earlier, right?

128
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,352
Okay, sure.

129
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,396
What's going on?

130
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:28,814
I…

131
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:33,235
I think I got valedictorian.

132
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,404
The top student at the academy.

133
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,406
Goodness. You?

134
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:40,700
They said I could go to the station
of my choice if I got valedictorian.

135
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:43,995
Jeez. I've made it!

136
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,164
It must've been hard for you.

137
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,584
You've done all the work!
I'm so proud of you.

138
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:53,171
Will the President be there?

139
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:54,714
Will you be in the newspaper?

140
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,926
I'll go there and take 100 pictures
of you with the President.

141
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,929
No, I'll take 1,000. 10,000 pictures!

142
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:02,639
We have to show Mom.

143
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,685
Jeez. Mom would've loved that, right?

144
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,689
We need to celebrate.

145
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:12,315
Sir!

146
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,818
Can I get bottle each of <i>soju </i>and beer?

147
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:17,279
And one <i>galbi-jjim</i>, please.

148
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,406
You can't. You drove here.

149
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:23,118
I can leave it here. I have to stay
a night at your place anyway.

150
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,829
We should be drinking on a day like this.

151
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,541
Here, wear this. Let's drink.

152
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:35,005
Just for today.

153
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,966
We're only going to have good days now.

154
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:39,551
Suffering's over!

155
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:41,887
Shall we drink?

156
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,472
That suits you.

157
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:47,142
Sir, bring us the drinks first, please.

158
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:50,937
-Cheers to your bright future!
-Cheers!

159
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,234
Goodness.

160
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:57,777
I feel great.

161
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,322
I broke my 87th day of sobriety.

162
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:01,615
Take it slow.

163
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,575
I will.

164
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:08,830
I've been enduring it for a day like this.

165
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,128
I hope you can quit drinking

166
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:17,464
and get married.

167
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:22,344
Well…

168
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,137
Are you and Mi-young

169
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:26,348
talking about marriage yet?

170
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:28,517
Marriage?

171
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:34,105
Where are you going?

172
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,732
I'm getting more drinks.

173
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,406
Just bring a bottle.

174
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,117
Jeez. Four is too many.

175
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,577
Let's just drink.

176
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,332
What's wrong?

177
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,417
What's going on?

178
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,798
I have nothing to offer
in dating nor marriage.

179
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:04,135
I don't even have a high school diploma.
All I have is criminal record.

180
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,639
Our alcoholic father
passed away in prison.

181
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:11,351
And when our mother died,
I made a mess in our house.

182
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,146
What good would it be
to be involved with a guy like me?

183
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,263
It's too late for me.

184
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,599
You should focus on your success.

185
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:57,397
I will take good care of myself.

186
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,650
-You should--
-Goodness. That's all that matters.

187
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,992
You are always so kind
and never complain.

188
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:12,203
You studied so hard
and didn't use money hastily.

189
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:13,872
Even when we lived in an orphanage,

190
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,957
you never once complained.

191
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:20,920
How did someone like our father
give birth to someone like you?

192
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,007
Maybe his your step-father.

193
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,347
Jeez. I'm just joking.

194
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,431
Here.

195
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:32,932
Drink up.

196
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:49,240
<i>When we went out to eat,</i>
<i>he drank seven bottles of soju.</i>

197
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,743
<i>He was really drunk.</i>

198
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:54,704
<i>I tried hard to control him.</i>

199
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,039
Young-chul!

200
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,290
<i>After I paid and went out,</i>

201
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,501
<i>-his car was gone.</i>
-Goodness.

202
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,755
<i>I walked towards the car that was parked.</i>

203
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,217
<i>I just kept on going.</i>

204
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,012
<i>When I ran towards the alley…</i>

205
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:14,724
<i>he had already…</i>

206
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,896
Seo Young-chul's blood alcohol level
was over 0.2.

207
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:22,107
I'm sorry.

208
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:24,734
No words can justify his action.

209
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:27,737
I will apologize

210
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,157
to the kids' parents

211
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,118
and live like a sinner everyday.

212
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,955
Can you give me
the guardian's contact information?

213
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,416
Please, I beg you.

214
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,084
I can't do that.

215
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,502
Let me explain.

216
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:46,089
Since Seo Young-chul is unconscious,
indictment is suspended for time being.

217
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,049
Once he passes, the case will be closed.

218
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:51,845
Right.

219
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,138
Check the surveillance camera.

220
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:56,057
That's the end of witness investigation.
You should go home.

221
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:59,644
-Okay.
-The surveillance camera…

222
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,023
is rotatable 360 degrees.

223
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,317
So there's nothing much.

224
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:09,571
Look at the kid running.

225
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,666
Even if you kill me a hundred times,
a thousand times,

226
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,545
I have nothing to say.

227
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,134
What my brother did

228
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,012
is basically on me.

229
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:37,932
I'm so sorry.

230
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:43,396
This is my fault.

231
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,357
What happened to your older brother,

232
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,359
is all my fault.

233
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:51,946
I'm sorry.

234
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,491
I am to blame.

235
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,167
Everything is my fault.

236
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:06,711
Everything.

237
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:11,216
I'm the sinner.

238
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:20,475
<i>What my brother did</i>

239
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:23,102
<i>is basically on me.</i>

240
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,190
<i>I'm the sinner.</i>

DAD

248
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,336
Yes, Dad.

249
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,339
<i>Why aren't you</i>
<i>picking up your phone all day?</i>

250
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:35,800
<i>Are you busy studying?</i>

251
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,594
Yes.

252
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,345
<i>Are you having a hard time?</i>

253
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:40,430
Not at all.

254
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:43,725
Dong-joo…

255
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:46,102
<i>Why do you want to last forever?</i>

256
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:47,729
Never mind.

257
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:52,108
<i>-What the…</i>
-Jeez. Come home to eat.

258
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:55,320
I'll cook you
soybean paste stew with crab in it.

259
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:57,655
Okay, I will.

260
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,241
<i>You should go out and get fresh air.</i>

261
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:04,329
<i>The breeze of fresh air is really nice.</i>

262
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:09,417
I don't know why
good things end so quickly.

263
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:19,552
I know, right?

264
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:37,028
SAMYOOK SEOUL HOSPITAL MEMORIAL HALL

265
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,154
Dong-joo!

266
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:16,484
Why did Tae-hee go
to the intensive care unit?

267
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:17,735
I don't know.

268
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,363
Maybe he went to work.

269
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:22,448
No, I think he came to see a patient.

270
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,325
What patient?

271
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:26,869
He killed a man when driving drunk.

272
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,788
After the accident, he was unconscious

273
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,498
for about two years.

274
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,834
But he gained consciousness today.

275
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:39,173
So, did Tae-hee leave
after he saw the patient?

276
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,592
No, he only saw the patient's guardian.

277
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:43,511
But Tae-hee

278
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:47,056
stared at the guardian.

279
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:48,683
They seemed to know each other.

280
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:54,105
Jeez.

281
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:57,442
Tae-hee.

282
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,027
Where are you?

283
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:11,831
What the?

284
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:13,708
It's Baek Dong-joo.

285
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:16,335
I missed you.

286
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,546
We see each other everyday.

287
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:22,467
I missed you slightly more today.

288
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,929
Even if I tell him to stop drinking,
he won't listen.

289
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,389
Did something happen today?

290
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:29,807
Well…

291
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,977
Let's go home. I'll call taxi.

292
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:37,398
Not right now.

293
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,027
Let's stay a little bit longer.

294
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:58,127
Jeez. Do you have a headache again?

295
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:02,423
Goodness.

296
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:06,594
Your body and your heart work together.

297
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,473
You worry too much.

298
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,893
I want to be a police officer.

299
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,813
I want to be stronger

300
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,273
and catch all the bad guys.

301
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,944
I'm also going to catch
everyone who's mean to you.

302
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,199
Sure.

303
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:29,450
Come here.

304
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,119
Lie down.

305
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:33,538
Jeez.

306
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,248
Here.

307
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,250
After you wake up,

308
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,129
your headache will go away
and you'll be a police officer.

309
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:46,050
<i>When Mom</i>

310
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:50,638
<i>Goes to pick oysters</i>

311
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:57,979
<i>In the shade of the island</i>

312
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,066
<i>The baby</i>

313
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:06,028
<i>Is left all alone.</i>

314
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,325
The baby is pitiful.

315
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:19,208
Goodness. I'm working so hard.

316
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,837
If you're watching from above,

317
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:27,800
please help me.

318
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:44,275
I heard you went to the ICU.

319
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:49,572
Did you go to meet him?

320
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:54,243
There's was something
I really wanted to say.

321
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,336
That's why I went for the first time.

322
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:05,922
But…

323
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,676
I met Hae-an there.

324
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:13,679
Hae-an?

325
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:16,224
Yes, Hae-an.

326
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:21,562
<i>But Tae-hee stared at the guardian.</i>
<i>They seemed to know each other.</i>

327
00:25:21,646 --> 00:25:23,522
<i>The guardian's a police officer.</i>

328
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:26,234
Apparently, he was
the guy's younger brother.

329
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:30,988
We saw each other everyday,

330
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:33,824
joked around,

331
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:36,118
and ate together.

332
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:43,626
Hae-an, who liked me and listened so well,

333
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:50,007
was the guy's younger brother.

334
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:28,879
Goodness. Let's lie him down.

335
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:30,548
I'll open the door.

336
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,261
Goodness.

337
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:38,431
Careful.

338
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:50,776
You must be exhausted.
Go up and rest.

339
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:51,986
Okay.

340
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:39,241
<i>I'm sorry I couldn't even say my goodbye.</i>

341
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,244
<i>Thank you for everything.</i>

342
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:52,713
<i>I</i>

343
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:54,840
<i>really like you.</i>

344
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:57,802
I'm always on your side.

345
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:04,016
Thank you for the clothes.

346
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:16,654
Can you hear me?

347
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:19,824
Can you even see me?

348
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,327
Jeez. Your eyes are wide open.

349
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:26,163
Young-chul.

350
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:27,998
Can you…

351
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,460
Can you feel this?

352
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:35,297
Goodness. Respond in some way.

353
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:37,508
If you can feel this,

354
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:40,052
blink your eye.

355
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:51,772
The surveillance camera?

356
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:53,357
Why all of a sudden?

357
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:54,859
Well…

358
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:56,986
I want to check something.

359
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,237
I see.

360
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,364
I can show you,

361
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:03,993
but unfortunately,
there wasn't anything in particular.

362
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:11,542
ACCIDENT SCENE
INVESTIGATION REPORT

363
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,253
What the…

364
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:15,546
Hey, why isn't it here?

365
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:16,714
What?

366
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,966
There's no video
of the Bongsu Market incident.

367
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,427
Some files went missing
after a server problem the other day.

368
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,762
I applied for restoration, but it seems
that it has not been completed yet.

369
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,222
I see.

370
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:27,725
Is there a problem?

371
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:28,809
Well…

372
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:30,561
It seems difficult

373
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:33,230
to view the CCTV footage now,
what should I do?

374
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:36,775
Would it be okay if we get back
to you when we recover it?

375
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:38,444
Is that okay?

376
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:39,904
I apologize.

377
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,531
I see. That's fine.

378
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:44,158
Okay.

379
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,416
Il-seob?

380
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,338
Il-seob?

381
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:58,422
Yes.

382
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,341
Yes.

383
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,343
What's wrong?

384
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:08,182
Nothing. I had a nightmare yesterday
and I didn't sleep well.

385
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:09,558
I see.

386
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:25,282
Hello?

387
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:32,456
Goodness. My poor little baby.

388
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,874
PARK SEO-HA
DATE OF DEATH 10/19/2022

389
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:39,463
What should I do?
I feel so bad for my baby.

390
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:45,135
It's too cold.

391
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:48,264
I want to stay with my baby
for just a little bit longer.

392
00:30:49,223 --> 00:30:50,349
Just one minute.

393
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:51,892
Even just one second.

394
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:56,272
What can I do to stay with my baby?

395
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:58,816
Will there

396
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:01,485
be a tiny mortuary?

397
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:13,706
Dad.

398
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:20,087
Did you make

399
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:22,423
her bring Seo-ha here?

400
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:26,719
How dare you -bring Seo-ha here.

401
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,053
Dad.

402
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:30,347
This happened to Seo-ha because of you.

403
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:33,225
It all happened because
you've got bad luck on your hands!

404
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:36,645
After all,

405
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:40,524
you approached us to open up
this business, aren't I right?

406
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:45,195
That's why you didn't listen to me
when I told you not to come near us again!

407
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,865
For you, dead people

408
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:49,325
seem like money, right? You bastard!

409
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,035
Chief mourner, please calm down.

410
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:52,745
For who, huh?

411
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:54,788
I'm not the chief mourner!

412
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:56,665
Dad, stop it!

413
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,253
Where's Seo-ha?

414
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:02,671
Bring me my child!

415
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,340
-Dad…
-I said, where is she?

416
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:07,509
Bring me back my child!

417
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:09,637
Bring me back my child!

418
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:15,434
Love your enemy?

419
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:19,563
Did God love His enemy too?

420
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:22,441
What's wrong?

421
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,152
No, I mean…

422
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:26,987
Hate the sin

423
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:30,115
and not the sinner…
Isn't there a saying like that?

424
00:32:31,492 --> 00:32:33,619
But he's not the one who has sinned.

425
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,955
Well, in a broader sense,

426
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,750
there are people
who should be seen as enemies.

427
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,460
That's what I'm saying.

428
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,672
At times, I have a grudge against him,

429
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:46,840
then, at other times,
I feel sorry for him.

430
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:50,010
Jeez. Father, I don't know what to do.

431
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:53,514
Do you remember Proverbs 25:21?

432
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:56,308
"If your enemy is hungry,
give him food to eat."

433
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,519
"If he is thirsty,
give him water to drink."

434
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:02,314
I fed him food and even beer.

435
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:05,609
It's like putting coals on your head.

436
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:07,903
God will

437
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,322
repay you for that.

438
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:12,950
Coal?

439
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:16,912
I asked if I should love my enemy.

440
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,080
What do you mean coal?

441
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,624
Embrace your enemies
with a welcoming heart

442
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:22,167
is what I'm saying.

443
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:25,629
Do it until
you realize it yourself and repent.

444
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:28,298
Let go of the hatred
that torments oneself,

445
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:31,719
and earn peace on one's mind.
God has always emphasized this.

446
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:34,138
You said to let go of hatred

447
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:37,307
and to put coal on my head.

448
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:39,143
Isn't that too contradictory?

449
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,855
-Brother.
-Yes.

450
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:45,357
Well, I think this will become
a long conversation.

451
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:49,319
Why don't we first
light a charcoal fire and talk?

452
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,155
Let's go.

453
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:54,324
What? Well… Father!

454
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,035
Jeez.

455
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,204
I drove here.

456
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:15,012
Thank you.

457
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,061
Why did you

458
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,690
come back that other time?

459
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:28,567
Excuse me?

460
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:30,736
The time when you quit.

461
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,781
I thought you'd never return.

462
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:35,908
Right.

463
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:38,911
I felt uneasy.

464
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:43,582
I made you do your first coffining
at a young age.

465
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,085
So I wondered
if that was the reason you left.

466
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:53,509
Did you ever regret coming back?

467
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:59,848
I can't say no.

468
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,726
How about you?

469
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:05,854
Do you ever regret doing this job?

470
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,524
Of course, there are many times.

471
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:13,237
I thought maybe I should've just gotten
an office job like everyone else.

472
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:18,200
Then, why do you keep doing it?

473
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:21,036
Well…

474
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,082
After coffining,

475
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:30,295
the deceased seemed
to be saying thank you to me.

476
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,423
Every time.

477
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:41,056
I'm there at the end of their lives.

478
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,684
Helping with closure in their lives

479
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:45,769
is my job.

480
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:47,604
That's what I thought.

481
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:56,572
But it's still too hard
to finish a short life

482
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:00,158
that hasn't had a chance to bloom.

483
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,789
So I understand why
he's behaving like that.

484
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:10,460
The knot I make
is the end for the deceased.

485
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:14,590
But for the remaining people,

486
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,260
it's the beginning of their suffering.

487
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,056
<i>I bought two glasses of persimmon juice.</i>

488
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:05,724
<i>One for Il-seob and one for you.</i>

489
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,476
<i>I'll leave after I bring them to you.</i>

490
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:10,103
<i>Not right now. I'm serious.</i>

491
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:12,856
<i>Why?</i>

492
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,881
Hyun-joo.

493
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,842
How terrifying would it be?

494
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:46,306
How cold would it be?

495
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,728
To go out in the dark all alone.

496
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:04,741
I bought padded jacket.

497
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:10,455
Let's put it on.

498
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:55,083
Can you go inside?

499
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,050
Let's go in.

500
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:29,493
You can't be here.

501
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:31,703
I'll leave.

502
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:33,872
Hey, So-ra!

503
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:43,298
Seo Hae-an.

504
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,218
Check how the request
for CCTV video restoration went.

505
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:48,512
-Yes, sir.
-Goodness.

506
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:50,722
Why would this happen
when I'm training someone new.

507
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:53,016
Why? Was it something important?

508
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,811
There was an incident
at Bongsu Market two years ago.

509
00:39:55,894 --> 00:40:00,232
The guardian came to see the CCTV footage,
and the footage got erased after.

510
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,526
Jeez. It was frustrating.

511
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:05,320
But why do you need
the video from two years ago?

512
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:06,988
I don't know.

513
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:09,658
Anyway, someone who claims to be
his older brother came,

514
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,368
but I couldn't show it.

515
00:40:25,674 --> 00:40:26,758
Dong-joo.

516
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:33,890
Did you hear that I left the house?

517
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:36,226
Jeez.

518
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,896
I'm sorry that I couldn't say my goodbye.

519
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:42,941
No, you don't have to apologize to me.

520
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:48,697
Did you find a new home?

521
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:51,449
No, not yet.

522
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:55,912
Are Tae-hee and Vincent doing well?

523
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:04,087
Never mind. Of course,
they wouldn't be okay.

524
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,216
Everything is my fault.

525
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:10,510
I'm the sinner.

526
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:18,018
I'm sorry for keeping such a busy person.
You should get going. I have to go too.

527
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:19,603
-Go safely.
-Okay.

528
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:23,106
Hey…

529
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:29,112
Do you

530
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:31,948
know why Tae-hee

531
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:35,285
came to the hospital…

532
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,330
that day?

533
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:39,998
Excuse me?

534
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,129
I mean… Never mind.

535
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:48,256
I'm so out of it right now.

536
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,966
I keep saying nonsense.

537
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,636
I should leave. You should go too.

538
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:06,358
Jeez. There must've been an accident.

539
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:09,152
Why aren't they more careful
in the kids' zone.

540
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,447
I think it's a big accident.

541
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,449
They need to be careful.

542
00:42:14,783 --> 00:42:16,826
Goodness. How scary.

543
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:24,751
Ma'am, you didn't turn on your signal!

544
00:42:25,085 --> 00:42:27,504
-Stop lying!
-Listen to me.

545
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,896
Direct signals take precedence.

546
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:42,662
Your older brother…

547
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:52,589
I wished for your brother
to wake up and live.

548
00:43:56,718 --> 00:43:59,387
I didn't think there would be
a bigger pain than that.

549
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:06,019
I wished for him
to suffer for a long time.

550
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:10,565
I will never forgive.

551
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:15,487
Even when I think over it
for the 100th or 1,000th times,

552
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:18,782
I can't forigve.

553
00:44:26,456 --> 00:44:28,166
Everything you say is right.

554
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:33,421
I lived my life thinking that I had
no such thing as an older brother.

555
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:35,799
When someone asks,

556
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:38,426
I'd think

557
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:40,970
that I had no parents,

558
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:46,184
no siblings,
and that I was just left alone.

559
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:50,688
I was greedy.

560
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:55,485
In a ridiculous life like mine,

561
00:44:56,528 --> 00:44:58,446
I met you who were like a family.

562
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:01,908
I was just happy.

563
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:06,955
It was all a dream.

564
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:11,376
I was so into the dream,

565
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:14,754
I forgot about my life.

566
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:21,094
Now,

567
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:24,931
I'll never go near you.

568
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,936
I'll just hide

569
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,105
like a shadow.

570
00:45:42,115 --> 00:45:43,450
Did you hear…

571
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:47,829
what Joon-ho said that day?

572
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:52,250
Excuse me?

573
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:54,252
Did Joon-ho say anything to you?

574
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:58,506
<i>Sir.</i>

575
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:00,884
Please save me.

576
00:46:04,554 --> 00:46:05,680
That day,

577
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,310
if only I had arrived earlier,

578
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:12,312
I would've heard something.

579
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:19,277
I'm sorry I can't even help with this.

580
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:23,656
Why…

581
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:27,327
is Joon-ho your younger brother…

582
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:28,745
And why

583
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:31,581
is Seo Young-chul

584
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:33,458
my older brother?

585
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:40,590
If it wasn't for that,

586
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,135
it would've been better

587
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:46,262
for you and me.

588
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:49,724
It would've been so much better.

589
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:00,235
I'll get going.

590
00:47:09,202 --> 00:47:10,203
Hae-an.

591
00:47:32,267 --> 00:47:35,603
You told him to come back?

592
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,694
-Hey, you fool!
-Yes?

593
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:44,946
What's with your outfit!

594
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:47,365
You work for the government!
You should have more dignity.

595
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:48,658
Hurry and go wash up.

596
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:52,078
-Wash thoroughly!
-Yes, sir.

597
00:48:01,129 --> 00:48:02,255
You're okay, right?

598
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:11,723
STOP BY

599
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:12,974
You did good.

600
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:16,269
You think so?

601
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:20,481
Actually, it's what I'm supposed to do.

602
00:48:22,734 --> 00:48:25,069
I think Vincent and I were
too mean to him.

603
00:48:25,153 --> 00:48:26,154
What?

604
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,364
How so?

605
00:48:29,032 --> 00:48:30,408
You weren't at all.

606
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:32,368
Don't think that way.

607
00:48:32,994 --> 00:48:34,078
I mean,

608
00:48:34,162 --> 00:48:36,539
you're not God nor Buddha.

609
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:39,751
It's a natural feeling to have.

610
00:48:40,043 --> 00:48:41,294
So

611
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:43,921
don't think you've behaved badly.

612
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:46,049
Not at all.

613
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:48,676
You don't have to
feel sorry for Hae-an either.

614
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:51,471
It's not Hae-an's fault.

615
00:48:52,472 --> 00:48:53,473
Jeez.

616
00:48:54,891 --> 00:48:56,851
He was crying saying that he was sorry.

617
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:57,977
Right!

618
00:48:58,478 --> 00:49:01,898
It could be that
he's just someone who cries a lot.

619
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:03,566
Remember last time?

620
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:05,777
After he got rejected by me,

621
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:08,655
he was crying.

622
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:11,032
That's right.

623
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:12,825
He's just someone who cries a lot.

624
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:18,748
So you don't need to feel guilty, okay?

625
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:20,124
Okay?

626
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:24,379
Why are you laughing?

627
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:29,342
How did I meet someone like you?

628
00:49:30,927 --> 00:49:33,721
I know, right?
How'd you meet a girl like me?

629
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:37,517
You're charming.

630
00:49:43,815 --> 00:49:45,608
When I'm talking with you,

631
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:49,278
I feel like I can breathe.

632
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:56,452
Thank you…

633
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:00,373
for helping me move on.

634
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:08,506
Cheers.

636
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:55,511
Why?

637
00:51:05,438 --> 00:51:06,522
Hello.

638
00:51:07,023 --> 00:51:08,024
Hello.

639
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,402
I'm here to ask you for a favor.

640
00:51:11,486 --> 00:51:12,779
Yes?

641
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:16,574
You're not a big mouth, right?

642
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:18,451
Could you keep this from Dong-joo?l

643
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:20,495
Could you do that for me?

644
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:23,915
What's this about?

645
00:51:35,218 --> 00:51:36,302
Go ahead first.

646
00:52:19,846 --> 00:52:21,138

Thank you so much.

650
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,362
I won't forget.

651
00:53:25,453 --> 00:53:26,495
Sure.

652
00:53:36,172 --> 00:53:37,173
Excuse me…

653
00:53:40,635 --> 00:53:41,677
Here.

654
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:45,431
Il-seob prepared this for you.

655
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,023
Seo-ha

656
00:53:55,608 --> 00:53:57,693
will always be by your side.

657
00:54:00,196 --> 00:54:02,365
Seo-ha is a jewel.

658
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:06,994
The jewel and Seo-ha

659
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:09,372
are so good together.

660
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:14,794
Thank you

661
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:18,506
for safely sending Seo-ha.

662
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:38,401

KIM TAE-HEE

664
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:19,358
Hello?

665
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:24,530
You didn't tell Dong-joo, right?

666
00:55:26,866 --> 00:55:28,367
No. What brings you here?

667
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:29,660
Well…

668
00:55:30,036 --> 00:55:32,121
Yoo So-ra asked me to deliver this.

669
00:55:57,772 --> 00:55:59,231
BP is dropping.

670
00:55:59,315 --> 00:56:01,358
-Give me protoporphyrin.
-Yes, sir.

671
00:56:01,442 --> 00:56:03,360
Contact the guardian
and ask what he's going to do.

672
00:56:03,444 --> 00:56:05,946
Last time, he wrote a memorandum
to give up life-sustaining treatment,

673
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,698
-Shall I still contact him?
-Yes.

674
00:56:07,782 --> 00:56:09,992
He might want to see his last moments.

675
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:14,413
The patient's in arrest.

676
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:27,093
October 22nd.

677
00:56:27,343 --> 00:56:28,636
4:01 p.m.

678
00:56:29,095 --> 00:56:30,805
Seo Young-chul has passed.

679
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:33,933
Stop the treatment.

680
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:36,435
Yoo So-ra, get to your senses.

681
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:40,439
Call the police. They will have procedures
to move him to the funeral home.

682
00:56:40,523 --> 00:56:42,066
-Go ahead.
-Yes, ma'am.

683
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:56,664
Yes, Tae-hee.

684
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:03,754
My older brother

685
00:57:05,214 --> 00:57:06,382
has passed.

686
00:57:11,387 --> 00:57:12,805
They said he has passed.

687
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:19,395
What do I do?

688
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:48,132
Jeez.

689
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,926
Hey, the new errand request…

690
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,221
What's wrong?

691
00:57:55,014 --> 00:57:56,307
What happened?

692
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:00,811
He passed.

693
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:02,271
Who?

694
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:04,398
Seo Young-chul.

695
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,725
DONG-JOO

696
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:52,780
Yes, Dong-joo.

CHIEF MOURNER : SEO HAE-AN

699
00:59:54,008 --> 00:59:55,134
Dong-joo.

700
00:59:55,426 --> 00:59:57,303
Yes, Tae-hee.

701
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:02,599
Well…

702
01:00:06,729 --> 01:00:07,730
The coffining…

703
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,482
Are you…

704
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:12,276
Right.

705
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:13,861
Yes.

706
01:00:17,865 --> 01:00:18,866
Well…

707
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:24,371
I mean…

708
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:25,914
Tae-hee.

709
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:31,795
But this time,

710
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:36,342
I don't think I'd be able to meet him.

711
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:40,721
There's something I didn't tell you.

712
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:43,349
I can't meet anyone

713
01:00:44,183 --> 01:00:46,101
who has killed someone

714
01:00:47,603 --> 01:00:49,396
or committed suicide.

715
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:54,651
I'm sorry.

COFFIN ROOM

717
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:38,737
How was

718
01:01:40,406 --> 01:01:41,532
Joon-ho?

719
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:46,286
He would've been scared all by himself.

720
01:01:47,496 --> 01:01:49,540
He would've been in a lot of pain.

721
01:02:43,218 --> 01:02:44,386
Who are you?

722
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:47,681
Where am I?

723
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:50,809
Seo Young-chul.

724
01:02:53,187 --> 01:02:54,605
How do you know my name?

725
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,192
Where am I?

726
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:20,422
You've had it so tough.

727
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,096
Rest in peace.

728
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:30,307
In peace…

729
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:40,234
Seo Young-chul…

730
01:03:42,194 --> 01:03:43,445
you have passed away.

731
01:03:49,076 --> 01:03:50,160
I…

732
01:03:52,663 --> 01:03:53,789
am dead?

733
01:04:03,674 --> 01:04:05,551
My life is so unfair.

734
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:08,554
Do you have any cigarettes?

735
01:04:18,146 --> 01:04:20,274
I can't even smoke
a cigarette before I go.

736
01:04:20,816 --> 01:04:23,318
It would've been nice
if I had a shot of <i>soju</i>.

737
01:04:24,987 --> 01:04:28,031
Jeez. I couldn't even say goodbye
to my younger brother.

738
01:04:30,409 --> 01:04:32,452
I couldn't even see Mi-young.

739
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:36,999
I wonder if she got married.

740
01:04:41,003 --> 01:04:44,256
Do you remember the accident
you caused two years ago?

741
01:04:45,591 --> 01:04:46,925
Is the kid alive?

742
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:52,806
No.

743
01:04:56,935 --> 01:04:59,104
I feel so bad for that kid.

744
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:02,107
But I can't do anything. I'm dead too.

745
01:05:03,275 --> 01:05:04,818
You didn't kill him.

746
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:15,621
Who killed him?

747
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:17,914
That kid.

748
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:09,633
A DIME A JOB

749
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:26,024
{\an8}<i>There's no chance to make it right again.</i>

750
01:06:26,108 --> 01:06:27,275
{\an8}<i>Tell the truth.</i>

751
01:06:27,442 --> 01:06:30,028
{\an8}<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>you want to hear from me.</i>

752
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:32,239
{\an8}<i>It was me who hit him! Me!</i>

753
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:33,782
{\an8}<i>What did Seo Young-chul say?</i>

754
01:06:33,865 --> 01:06:36,993
{\an8}<i>That he will apologize</i>
<i>a hundred times, a thousand times.</i>

755
01:06:37,077 --> 01:06:39,287
{\an8}<i>Tae-hee, let's forget about it.</i>

756
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:42,374
{\an8}<i>If you start hiding</i>
<i>even a trivial thing for no reason,</i>

757
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:44,793
{\an8}<i>it's hard to see the other person.</i>

758
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,462
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>Seo Young-chul is the culprit.</i>
