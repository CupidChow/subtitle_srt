<i>While a full-term pregnant woman has been</i>
<i>found dead in a public housing in Seoul,</i>

2
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:43,085
<i>the murder suspect was</i>
<i>arrested without a warrant by the police.</i>

3
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:47,465
{\an8}<i>The police specified the target by legwork</i>
<i>and surveillance camera analysis</i>

4
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:50,926
{\an8}<i>and arrested suspect Jeon-ssi</i>
<i>15 hours after the incident was reported.</i>

5
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,764
<i>The police are planning to interrogate</i>

6
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:57,099
<i>And then request a bench warrant for him.</i>

7
00:00:58,142 --> 00:01:02,438
<i>Also, the fact that this incident occurred</i>
<i>while the victim's husband left the house</i>

8
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:05,441
<i>to buy apples for his wife's</i>

9
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:08,778

10
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:13,199

11
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:16,869

14
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:39,892
Are you okay?

15
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:46,232
-Thank you!
-No problem.

16
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,904
It's pretty heavy. Where do you live?
Would you like them delivered?

17
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:53,072
No, it's fi...

There is a promotion right now,

21
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,552
-Actually, I will just--
-Eonju University Funeral Home, please.

22
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:17,346
Funeral home, you say?

23
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:19,098
Excuse me.

24
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:27,356
-Yes, mother.
-<i>You're going where?</i>

25
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,818
<i>I'm not even sure if I would let you</i>

26
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,529
<i>Where are you? I will be right there!</i>

27
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,072
No...

28
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:37,449
Yes, mother...

00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:42,621
WITH THE COUNTRY PARTY REP HONG HAN-SU

{\an8}EPISODE 4

31
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:12,902
{\an8}What's going on here?

32
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:14,612
{\an8}PRIME MINISTER KANG
MAY SHE REST IN PEACE

33
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,410
{\an8}Who is that man that brought
all those other people?

34
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,080
{\an8}Prime minister of Republic of Korea,
Kang Jae-geun.

35
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:29,585
{\an8}District legislators, members of
National Assembly, now the prime minister.

36
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,086
{\an8}It's a party.

37
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:38,469
Time for food isn't coming but all the
other unexpected things are, huh.

38
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,930
You haven't had
anything yet either, right?

39
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,891
I'm fine.
I'm more worried about the chief mourner.

40
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,809
He hasn't had a drop of water yet.

41
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,562
Your excellency, this way, please.

42
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:50,064
You didn't call the reporters?

43
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,148
Apologies.

44
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,110
Truly amazing.

45
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:59,949
-Why are they even here?
-You're doing it again. Calm down.

46
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,703
-Go get ready.
-Yes, sir. Wait, how about you?

47
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:09,667
Team leader Seo has agreed to help out.
It concerns me to leave the room.

48
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:13,253
When the body is ready to coffin
I'll bring the chief mourner.

49
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:15,547
Yes, sir. I understand.

00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,742
DECEASED MS. SEO GANG
CHIEF MOURNER HUSBAND LEE WON-HYO

51
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,784
We will serve you
to the best of our abilities.

52
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,512
-2 <i>juk, </i>right?
-Thank you.

53
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:46,805
-Enjoy the food.
-Will do.

54
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:52,061
-I'll be going now.
-Okay.

55
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,856
-Tae-hee <i>ssi</i>!
-Yes?

56
00:05:55,939 --> 00:06:01,320
I'm so sorry,
but can I ask you a favor, please?

57
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:05,240
-Sure.
-You know Dong-joo, right? From before.

58
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:12,039
-Yes.
-Can you deliver this to her, please?

59
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:13,999
Okay.

60
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:17,461
It concerns me to leave the room.
I'll leave this to you.

61
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,004
Where do you want it?

62
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:23,967
If you just leave it in front of the
room downstairs, I'll text Dong-joo.

63
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,011
-Understood.
-Thank you.

64
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,722
-Of course. Take care.
-You too.

65
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,778
Please eat, at least a little bit.

66
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:53,956
You still have...

67
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,501
The coffining to attend.

68
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:35,455
-Take care of the rest, Dong-joo ssi.
-Yes. Thank you for the help.

69
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:26,924
Miss! What did my Ddaeng-sam do
that he must die?

70
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:32,221
A baby should at least be born!

71
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,225
Miss.

72
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:43,148
Miss, I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

73
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:48,987
I complained that I couldn't eat,
sleep, or even sit down.

74
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:54,868
I was being too picky because of
the morning sickness. I'm sorry, so...

75
00:08:56,912 --> 00:09:02,918
Please, just let my baby live.
I'll do anything. Please!

76
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,216
Gang-i <i>ssi</i>.

77
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,928
You don't have a lot of time.

78
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:17,975
If you have anything to deliver
to your husband, I will do it.

79
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:22,729
My husband. Where is he?

80
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,038
100th-day?

81
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:48,046
You don't have to share
with the other foster kids anymore.

82
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,757
It's yours. Yours only.

83
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:59,975
Sorry. I didn't know I was supposed
to prepare something like this.

84
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,853
It's okay.

85
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:08,984
But you have to know
the meaning of this watch.

86
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:13,613
"I wish

87
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,533
to be with you

88
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:18,702
forever."

89
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:30,130
Wait. Are you crying?

90
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,092
I'm going to wear this until I die!

91
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:38,138
-You weren't gonna break up till you die?
-You were going to?!

92
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,850
Until death, no, even after death,
I'm not breaking up with you.

93
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,687
-Really?
-Really.

94
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:48,940
Promise!

95
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,278
Promise.

96
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:57,384
COFFIN ROOM
(WITNESSING ROOM)

97
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:24,828
COFFIN ROOM
(WITNESSING ROOM)

98
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,510
<i>It's not hard to do that, but...</i>

99
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:01,656
My husband

100
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,952
will try to follow me to death.

101
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,246
I know he will.

102
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,377
If that happens, Ddaeng-sam-i's leg...

103
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:20,759
Gang-i <i>ssi</i>!

104
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:26,848
Gang-i <i>ssi</i>, are you okay?

105
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,477
Gang-i <i>ssi</i>, please wake up!

106
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:02,801
Hey, please wait.

107
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,307
I know what it looks like,
but it's really nothing like it.

108
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,443
She said she wanted to

109
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,531
have one last call with her husband.

110
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,661
Who did?

111
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,543
I said, who said something like that?

112
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,379
The dead body?

113
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:43,133
Did a dead person really say that to you?

114
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,180
You're a complete nut job.

115
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:52,225
Dong-joo!

116
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:54,394
-Il-seob--
-Wait!

117
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:55,687
I can see ghosts.

118
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,981
It's true! They wake up when I touch them.

119
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,232
What the hell.

120
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,778
Dong-joo. Did our chief mourner
come down here by chance?

121
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,990
-No.
-He disappeared.

122
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:08,992
-What?!
-You go look for him too.

123
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,180
Why isn't it working? This can't be.

124
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,224
Oh no.

125
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,190
You're not done yet? What is all this?

126
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:44,110
Why are you all spaced out?
I heard the chief mourner disappeared.

127
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,528
We have to delay the coffining.

128
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:47,864
What do we do, then?

129
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,076
Take her back to the morgue.
We're on a schedule.

130
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:54,079
-You can't.
-Why not?

131
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,126
-Never mind.
-What's wrong with you?

132
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,095
What do I do?

133
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:14,599
EONJU UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
FUNERAL HOME

134
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:22,982
Where could he be?

135
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,526
<i>My husband</i>

136
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,154
<i>will try to follow me to death.</i>

137
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,990
<i>I know he will.</i>

138
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:33,284
Yes, detective.

139
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,871
He left the hospital?

140
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,292
But he left his wallet and phone here.

141
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:44,295
Is it a possibility that he just
stepped out briefly?

142
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,507
Oh, I see.

143
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,511
We're still just standing by.

144
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:54,764
Yes.

145
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,354
I understand.

146
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,572
Dong-joo,
let's wrap up the funeral for now.

147
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,628
FUNERAL HALL

148
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:33,386
10 HOURS SINCE APPLE MOM'S HUSBAND "A <i>SSI</i>"
HAS GONE MISSING

149
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:49,527
Have you seen the news?
That woman's husband disappeared.

150
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:53,740
-What if he's having bad thoughts?
-Obviously he is. Why wouldn't he?

151
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:56,075
I would, too, if I were him.

152
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,412
I've heard they're both orphans
with no parents or siblings.

153
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:01,039
Really?

154
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,847
<i>The police have dispatched task forces</i>
<i>to search the area around the funeral home</i>

155
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:21,518
<i>and are tracing his movements through</i>
<i>surveillance cameras and dash cams.</i>

156
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:25,980
<i>Also, upon a witness's statement that</i>
<i>he was seen exiting the funeral home</i>

157
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:29,108
<i>they are widening the search</i>
<i>to the entire Bongsu District</i>

158
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:32,237
<i>-and as location tracking is impossible...</i>
-You haven't left yet?

159
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,198
<i>...active citizen participation is needed.</i>

160
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,951
<i>-Officials have stated that Mr. A was...</i>
-Floor repairing.

161
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,245
-...<i>taking blame for his wife's death...</i>
-Yeah, I'm going.

162
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,873
<i>...and for the fact that he left all of</i>
<i>his belongings including his smartphone</i>

163
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:49,963
<i>the police will speed up the search</i>
<i>as to prevent any unspeakable situation.</i>

164
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:51,881
Yep. I'm leaving right now.

165
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,510
You got nothing this morning, right?
We have to put that up.

166
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,471
All right.

167
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:20,910
Hi!

168
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,579
Good morning.

169
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:24,330
Where did all your energy go?

170
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:26,624
Did you just get off work?

171
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:27,834
Yeah.

172
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,670
An all-nighter? Oh man.

173
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:34,340
It's that hard to get a penny
out of someone else's pocket.

174
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:35,550
I agree.

175
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:37,427
How's the place?

176
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,220
It is <i>so </i>nice.

177
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,764
Don't hesitate to let me know
if you need anything.

178
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,475
Right, you haven't
seen my nephew yet, right?

179
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,687
-The one you work with?
-Yeah.

180
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:49,272
Hey!

181
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,901
Come out for a sec.

182
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:58,531
Come on.

183
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,243
-A nephew...?
-Yep.

184
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:06,915
He's a little old, right?
My sister and I are pretty far apart.

185
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:09,542
Out, I said!

186
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,628
Then this must be...

187
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:15,298
Yes, it's called A Dime A Job,
a quality of life service company.

188
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:19,052
It opened only a few days ago.
We don't even have a sign up.

189
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,974
-Why aren't you out yet?!
-He looks busy. I'll introduce myself la--

190
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,517
Can you move any slower?

191
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:29,395
This is her?

192
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,191
You know each other?

193
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:37,904
<i>A man I know.</i>

194
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:41,824
No.

195
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:46,996
This is Baek Dong-joo <i>ssi</i>, apartment 202.

196
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,083
Good morning.

197
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,835
<i>A man that thinks I'm a nut job.</i>

198
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,549
He's kind of shy.

199
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:00,468
Welcome.

200
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:03,930
Let's shake hands.

201
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,350
Hey, you listening?

202
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,314
Nice to meet you.

203
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,653
<i>A man who knows</i>
<i>how terrifying my hands are.</i>

204
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:24,242
EP. 04
A MAN I KNOW

205
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,791
The two of you finally met.

206
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,836
I know Vincent here's
been wanting to see this happen.

207
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,465
When are you going to put up a sign?

208
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:43,177
Dong-joo <i>ssi.</i>
This house may look small and cute,

209
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:44,804
but it's actually a mixed-use building.

210
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,807
Let me explain. A Dime A Job

211
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,017
does everything.

212
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:51,102
Taking out the trash, recycling,

213
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,229
errands to convenience stores
and pharmacies.

214
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,107
On top of that, they kill bugs
and hammers nails for you, and...

215
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:59,360
Dong-joo <i>ssi</i>, you'll be shocked
when you hear this.

216
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:03,364
Holy moly,
they even deliver break-up messages.

217
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:05,658
Real capitalists here.

218
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:07,952
My goodness, it's crazy!

219
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:09,537
For real.

220
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:15,168
-Don't you need to go?
-Huh? Oh, right.

221
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,671
-I'm late.
-Give me a ride!

222
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:21,507
-Can you drop me off at the intersection?
-Get on, quick.

223
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:25,720
I'm going to start planning
a resident get-together soon,

224
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:29,182
so let's party hard sometime. Bye!

225
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:39,942
Leave.

226
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:51,829
Reason number one.

227
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:55,208
I don't like you.

228
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,087
Reason number two.

229
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,507
I <i>really </i>don't like you.

230
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,176
Reason number three.

231
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:08,805
I absolutely horrifyingly hate you.

232
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,060
If you hate me so much, you leave.

233
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:16,813
Didn't you sign the contract
with the CEO here?

234
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:20,024
My uncle just introduced me, didn't he?
That I'm his nephew.

235
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,738
Do I need to elaborate?

236
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:34,413
Alright. I'll leave.
I'll move out right now.

237
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:36,916
One more thing.

238
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:44,298
I really hope you'll stop
following me around.

239
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,426
I can always find another place to live.

240
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,887
It's warm.
I can just sleep on the streets.

241
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:33,639
Stingy, old man.

242
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,062
I can see where you're coming from.

243
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:43,608
Whatever. Can I please just know
where our chief mourner is?

244
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:47,278
-That's--
-Within God's will?

245
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:53,034
-Right. He's in--
-In good hands?

246
00:24:55,995 --> 00:25:00,124
-So all we--
-We can do is pray?

247
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,459
Exactly.

248
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:06,088
-So while you're here--
-Say the Lord's Prayer five times?

249
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:15,181
Our father, who art in heaven.

250
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:18,184
Where did our chief mourner go?

251
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:19,894
Where...

252
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:25,733
Why did she mention Ddaeng-sam-i's leg?
Why?

253
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,069
Is he kicking or something?

254
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,363
Just what is it?

255
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:35,284
This is driving me insane.

256
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:42,083
WITH MY CHILD MATERNITY HOSPITAL

257
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,835
I didn't get a wink of sleep last night.

258
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,672
She was due tomorrow.

259
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:50,925
How can something like this happen?

260
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:55,972
-They were so beautiful together.
-Tell me about it.

261
00:25:56,389 --> 00:26:00,268
I can still see them sobbing
in each other's arms

262
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:02,353
when they found out about the pregnancy.

263
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:06,065
I also heard it took a long time
to have that baby.

264
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:09,026
I can't count how many they lost.

265
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,073
They apparently got married at 19
because they wanted a baby.

266
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,868
I have no appetite.
Let's get something simple.

267
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:20,830
Okay. So-ra, let's go.

268
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:22,456
I have a friend visiting.

269
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:29,130
-Enjoy your lunch.
-Thanks.

270
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:37,596
Hey, did you find it? Did you?

271
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:42,518
Who are you to demand a mother's records?

272
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,603
-I'm a funeral director.
-So how is this your job?

273
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:48,607
I led her funeral. You should know,
you've seen her. How can I ignore this?

274
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:51,027
Please give a friend some attention!

275
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:54,363
I've been here less than ten days.
I've never met her.

276
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,325
Is that so? Okay great.
Can I have the records now?

277
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:02,371
Why are you curious about the baby's legs?

278
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,419
The chief mourner, the baby's father,
gave me the information.

279
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,714
Why? Why would he?

280
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:18,346
I'm curious too. Here, take this.

281
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:21,599
-What I'm curious about is...
-Yes?

282
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:24,560
Why are you all secretive about this?

283
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:29,398
Because I could've misheard it.
I'm just not certain.

284
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:42,161
You've misheard it.
The baby had straight, normal length legs.

285
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:46,582
There's plenty of cases where
the baby's legs are too short or too long.

286
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,666
But not this one.

287
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:49,293
You sure about that?

288
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:52,213
-Do you even know how to read charts?
-Hey!

289
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,467
I was called a genius in NNA,
National Nursing Assistant community.

290
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,512
I even got an 84 on the exam,
passing on the first try.

291
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:03,641
I am pretty offended.
I will not cooperate anymore.

292
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:08,145
-Who is that?
-Your boyfriend.

293
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,607
How old is he?
Where does he live? Is he tall?

294
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:13,317
Hand it over.

295
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:19,281
Giving patient's personal info like...
Why would you go here?

296
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:21,992
-Here. I'm going because...
-Yeah?

297
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:25,371
Hey, Kim Dong-joo!

298
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:29,083
You promised! Set me up with him!

299
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,943
Excuse me, ma'am.
You're not supposed to be here.

300
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,113
Oh, I'm...

301
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:02,867
Aren't you the funeral director lady?

302
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,076
Yes, that's correct.

303
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:07,788
-Oh, I remember now.
-But what brings you here?

304
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,793
I was just passing by.

305
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:14,336
Passing by, then came here?

306
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:21,510
-Whoa, Dong-joo <i>ssi</i>?
-Hae-an <i>ssi!</i>

307
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:32,188
Complaints from everywhere.
I'm stuck on that street thanks to that.

308
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:33,939
Thank you.

309
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:39,904
Anyway, the entire neighborhood is on edge
because it's such a big incident.

310
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:42,615
You have no fear, Dong-joo <i>ssi</i>.

311
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:49,538
I know I shouldn't,
but I thought, just in case.

312
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:53,209
I was curious and worried.

313
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:57,254
I overheard earlier
that you work at a funeral home.

314
00:29:57,922 --> 00:29:59,590
Eonju University Hospital, right?

315
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:01,842
Yes.

316
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:04,887
I feel sorry for you. It's harsh work.

317
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:08,474
-Nah, it's fine.
-Your face says it all.

318
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:12,728
And, seeing you come all the way here,
you really care about your clients.

319
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:17,399
-Did you a call from Norway yet?
-Norway?

320
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:19,818
To give you a Nobel Peace Prize.

321
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:28,244
I have to lecture you this one time.

322
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:31,872
I told you last time that
it's dangerous outside your bed, right?

323
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:36,418
They even dispatched task forces
to comb through the area.

324
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:39,338
All you have to do is just crack open
a watermelon and wait for the news.

325
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:41,632
Where do you think this is
coming out here?

326
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:43,259
I'm sorry.

327
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,177
Don't do it anymore, okay?

328
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:50,099
Dong-joo <i>ssi.</i>

329
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:55,563
I have this saying
that I always carve deeply in my heart.

330
00:30:57,815 --> 00:31:00,359
If you're sincere enough,
your wish will be granted.

331
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:05,239
Look at how concerned you are.
There's no reason not to grant your wish.

332
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:09,868
That person will no doubt come back.
Don't you worry.

333
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:12,746
He will, right?

334
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:14,582
Of course.

335
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:20,754
So for now, let's light a candle
in our hearts and trust in the police.

336
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,340
Right now, there's nothing else we can do.

337

340
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:46,030
I know he will.

341
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:50,242
If that happens on Ddaeng-sam-i's leg--

342
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:55,080
Ddaeng-sam-i's leg...

343
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,542
What about his leg?

344
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:19,938
-Good evening.
-Welcome.

345
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:21,690
-Can I have some <i>odolbbyeo?</i>
-Sure.

346
00:32:37,373 --> 00:32:38,374
Hey.

347
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:41,085
Hey!

348
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:43,170
Look at this.

349
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:46,215
I said, look.

350
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:53,097
If you think I'll let this slide because
your team leader is too busy to talk,

351
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,723
you're wrong.

352
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:58,143
Sure. Go right ahead.
Tell him about the nut job Baek Dong-joo.

353
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:01,063
I will. Once the chief mourner is found.
-Great.

354
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,857
Actually, none of that's important to me.

355
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:05,859
This is.

356
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:10,406
Take a look.

357
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,747
Our chief mourner is still missing.

358
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:22,334
I told you I see ghosts.

359
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:25,921
I definitely met the wife yesterday
and spoke to her.

360
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:30,008
She said he will follow her,
and was just getting to Ddaeng-sam-i's leg

361
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:31,677
-but you--
-What leg? Ddaeng-sam--

362
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,762
The baby's fetal name was Ddaeng-sam-i!

363
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:35,597
And she was just getting to his leg.

364
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:37,307
-You expect me to belie--
-I don't care.

365
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:40,227
I don't give a shit if you think
I'm a crazy bitch or not.

366
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:44,106
But you opened the door at that moment
and I couldn't hear the rest of it.

367
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,317
-Only if you didn't...
-How is this related to--

368
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:51,572
If you didn't open that door,
I could have heard the rest.

369
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:54,032
And if I did, we'd have found him already.

370
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,707
Don't you know how urgent this is?

371
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:05,210
This is life or death, and I missed it.

372
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:06,712
The most important thing!

373
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:08,797
Because of you.

374
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:15,554
Wait.

375
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:18,932
Are you saying this is all me? My fault?

376
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:21,143
No.

377
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:23,771
You're the one

378
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:25,731
that's following me around.

379
00:35:09,525 --> 00:35:10,984
Nice, cold beer.

380
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:16,031
<i>Would you like a drink?</i>
<i>Would you like a beer?</i>

381
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:20,369
Hey, why are you empty handed?
Where's my <i>odolbbyeo?</i>

382
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,912
Remember the weird woman?

383
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,665
I thought she was just weird.
No, she's insane.

384
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,084
What about my <i>odolbbyeo?</i>

385
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:30,671
She was insane.
Completely gone. A nut job!

386
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:34,383
-Don't you see my neck falling out?
-She was insane and even proud of it.

387
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:36,760
Too confident. Even shameless!

388
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:40,430
The most absurd thing is
apparently it's my fault she is!

389
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:42,140
<i>Odolbbyeo!</i>

390
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:46,270
Be right back with it.

391
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,449
-You're really staying here?
-Yep.

392
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,579
Why do you need my blanket?

393
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:07,165
-Did you really go to that house?
-Whose house?

394
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,293
-Apple mom.
-What?

395
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:11,712
Apple mom!

396
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:17,968
-She came over to the hospital today and--
-Shut up so I can sleep.

397
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:20,804
Why? Why sleep so uncomfortably?

398
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:22,973
I just feel like
sleeping uncomfortably sometimes.

399
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:27,436
Smells like grandma. I miss her.

400
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:30,188
I would've thought she was your grandma
If I didn't know any better.

401
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:34,443
He didn't disappear because of you,
and you're not the police.

402
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,320
Why are you running
around looking for him?

403
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:39,698
And why do you feel like sleeping
uncomfortably at someone else's workplace?

404
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:41,909
She's being weirdly stubborn again.

405
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,201
Is that it?

406
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,078
He wanted me out.

407
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:48,916
-What?
-I got kicked out by the owner.

408
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:52,669
-Why so sudden?
-I thought he was an angel, super nice.

409
00:36:53,337 --> 00:36:57,257
Hey, get up. What's wrong with him?

410
00:36:57,341 --> 00:36:59,092
-Stop it.
-I can't take it!

411
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:00,260
I can.

412
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:03,347
How dare he go off
on a power trip like that?

413
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,431
"Let's break up."

414
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:09,770
It was the jerk that
delivered that message to me.

415
00:37:15,776 --> 00:37:18,528
Hey. There's gonna be
construction tomorrow, though.

416
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:24,076

Oh, her!

430
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:09,246
Right, so in the midst of everything
her mother got scammed.

00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:13,625
<i>It's costing her an arm and a leg</i>
<i>to make up for that.</i>

432

Are you doing okay alone?
You're not scared?

433
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,633
What's there to be scared about?

434
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:25,387
It's quiet and comfy.

Wow, it's so good. Did they get
the strawberries from a department store?

443
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,104
I just taste sugar.

Your aunt? Why?

448
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:11,284
She's always suddenly happy, suddenly sad

449
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:14,287
suddenly angry, suddenly hot,
and then suddenly menopause.

450
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:19,209
You went from bad mood to
strawberry smoothie in <i>Cheongdam </i>so fast.

451

It's no use being in a bad mood by myself.

It's better to go outside.
Get some fresh air, you know?

I always came up on top

Let's see. "My name is Seo Gang."

505
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:56,361
"That's right. I was found
under the Seogang Bridge."

506
00:44:56,778 --> 00:45:01,324
"My husband's name is Won-hyo because
he was found under the Wonhyo Bridge."

507
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:05,829
"Considering there's Dong-ho, Seong-su,
Yang-hwa, and Yeong-dong too

508
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:12,585
it might be just that our foster mom was
just looking for a naming scheme. Yes."

509
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:17,924
<i>Won-hyo and I were siblings</i>
<i>that grew up in the same foster care</i>

510
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:21,177
<i>then friends, then lovers,</i>

511
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:24,347
<i>and now comrades as a married couple.</i>

512
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:32,647
<i>A great place for ramyeon, chimaek,</i>
<i>dates, and bicycle rides.</i>

513
00:45:33,148 --> 00:45:35,942
<i>A place loved by all Seoul citizens,</i>
<i>the Han river.</i>

514
00:45:36,568 --> 00:45:39,988
<i>For me, it was a place I feared.</i>

515
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:46,161
<i>It was only natural to want to avoid it</i>
<i>since I was abandoned there,</i>

516
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:48,037
<i>but I learned</i>

517
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:51,291
<i>something scarier at that place.</i>

518
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:54,794
<i>Family.</i>

519
00:45:56,463 --> 00:45:58,715
-Whatcha doing?
-Won-hyo.

520
00:46:00,717 --> 00:46:01,718
Do you know

521
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,554
what a family is?

522
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:07,974
<i>Something I never even</i>
<i>imagined in my life.</i>

523
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:12,687
There's a mom and a dad,

524
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:15,648
and then there's a child in the middle.

525
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:17,859
<i>Something that never existed for me.</i>

526
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:20,904
<i>Something I never had.</i>

527
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:29,454
<i>A family.</i>

528
00:46:30,163 --> 00:46:34,584
<i>"</i>But Kkyu-D, I really want to be
congratulated today."

529
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:40,465
<i>June 10th. I get a family today.</i>

530
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:44,219
<i>-I become a "mother"...</i>
-Look, it'll look so good on him.

531
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:46,513
-...<i>something I've never been called...</i>
<i>-</i>Yes, it will.

532
00:46:46,596 --> 00:46:49,682
-...<i>and my husband will become a "father".</i>
<i>-</i>So cute!

533
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:52,352
-<i>Something he's never been called before.</i>
-How does it look?

534
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:55,230
<i>Yes. Today, our baby</i>

535
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,690
<i>Ddaeng-sam-i will be born.</i>

536
00:46:58,942 --> 00:47:01,819
<i>-What did you say?</i>
<i>-The baby's fetal name was Ddaeng-sam-i!</i>

537
00:47:01,903 --> 00:47:03,446
<i>And she was just getting to his leg.</i>

538
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:06,324
<i>Oh! The baby's fetal name is Ddaeng-sam-i.</i>

539
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:09,077
<i>First of all, congratulations!</i>

540
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,913
Wow, what a beautiful story.

541
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:17,418
I am also reminded of the days
that my sons came to me.

542
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:21,756
Can we maybe do blessings first,
childbirth after? Can we put her on call?

543
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:23,758
Great.

544
00:47:24,217 --> 00:47:27,178
Ddaeng-sam-i. What an adorable fetal name.

545
00:47:27,262 --> 00:47:28,680
But where did it come from?

546
00:47:29,264 --> 00:47:32,225
<i>Oh, she explained it right here.</i>

547
00:48:08,595 --> 00:48:10,930
<i>The place we had our first kiss</i>

548
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:15,893
<i>was at the Ddaeng-sam-i Bridge.</i>

549
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:26,279
<i>I definitely met the wife yesterday</i>
<i>and spoke to her.</i>

550
00:48:26,738 --> 00:48:30,241
<i>She said he will follow her, and was</i>
<i>just getting to Ddaeng-sam-i Bridge</i>

551
00:48:30,325 --> 00:48:31,326
<i>but you...</i>

552
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:37,707
<i>"We don't have to be afraid</i>
<i>of bridges anymore."</i>

553
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:43,296
<i>"We were born again here</i>
<i>with that bridge."</i>

554
00:48:44,297 --> 00:48:47,550
<i>"Let's die together on this bridge someday</i>
<i>or whatever."</i>

555
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,428
<i>"He must have gotten that</i>
<i>from a movie or something."</i>

556
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:55,016
<i>"The start of history!</i>
<i>Thus, "Ddaeng-sam-i."</i>

557
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,227
<i>But where could this</i>
<i>Daeng-sam-i Bridge be?</i>

558
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:00,438
<i>It sounds like a secret code for them.</i>

559
00:49:01,022 --> 00:49:04,984
Daeng-sam-i.

563
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,730
<i>I presented him a watch.</i>

564

<i>I spent all the money I earned</i>
<i>from working at a fast food restaurant.</i>

565

I'm going to wear this until I die!

<i>My goodness. I had no idea</i>
<i>he really keeps his word.</i>

567
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:08,005
<i>He still wears it to this day.</i>

568
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:10,633
<i>I'm surprised it still works.</i>

569
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:19,100
"Kkyu-D, did you get the hint?
I think it's time I got him a new watch."

570
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:23,312
Of course! We're definitely
sending you some items.

571
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:26,482
First of all, for Ddaeng-sam-i's father,

572
00:50:26,566 --> 00:50:30,820

Lastly, username "Ddaeng-sam-i mom"
has left this message.

576
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:52,341
Honey, did you forget something?

577
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,887
You should have called me.
I could have gotten it for you.

578
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,089
No!

579
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:39,514
Let me go.

580
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:43,100
Let me go!

581
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:49,232
I said let me go. Please!

582
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:51,859
Your wife has left you a letter.

583
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:54,487
Just for a little bit.

584
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,241
Please.

585
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:02,119
Let go.

586
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,997
Let go!

587
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,584
Let me go!

588
00:52:11,546 --> 00:52:14,590
Let go of me!

589
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,855

<i>And I'll</i>

593
00:52:43,828 --> 00:52:45,288
<i>meet Won-hyo again.</i>

594
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:51,878
<i>That is so sweet. You're such a romantic.</i>

595
00:52:52,962 --> 00:52:55,673
<i>I'm starting to feel all fluffy inside.</i>

596
00:52:55,923 --> 00:53:01,137
<i>If you have anything to deliver</i>
<i>to your husband, I will do it.</i>

597

<i>I think I did.</i>

598
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:08,603
I never thought it would be my last...

599
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:13,441
I sent a story to a radio station.

600
00:53:17,153 --> 00:53:18,154
I really hope

601
00:53:18,446 --> 00:53:20,281
it gets read

602
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:23,159
and my husband hears it.

It's better to go outside.
Get some fresh air, you know?

"Even a broken clock is right

-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

but I don't make the calls.

624
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,390
It's usually the writers that do.

625
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:12,309
I already sent an email to the writers.

626
00:55:14,145 --> 00:55:16,313

00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,154
No, I didn't.

630
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,031
Then who wrote it?

631
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:30,786
A friend.

632
00:55:32,288 --> 00:55:33,789
A special friend of mine.

633
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:39,211
Are we on call with her yet?

634
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:45,968
What a shame. Apparently
the phone is turned off at the moment.

635
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:48,804
I wonder if she went into labor.

636
00:55:48,888 --> 00:55:53,142
Either way, I pray for
the mother to have an easy delivery

637
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:56,687
and for Ddaeng-sam-i to be
brought into the world safe and sound.

638
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:59,315
To the special friend
who sent us this story,

639
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:02,234
it would be great if you let us know
of any good news about them.

640
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:12,203
Great. Shall we listen to a song?

641

00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:07,276
<i>doubled.</i>

644
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,989
She couldn't eat anything except
for that hand squeezed juice.

645
00:58:56,242 --> 00:58:57,952
Not cut into pieces,

646
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,329
not refrigerated,

647
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:04,458
not blended because of the metallic smell.

648
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:08,254
Every single meal like that...

649
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:15,469
He must have been sent
in place of her mother.

650
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:24,478
By the God that you wished existed.

651
01:00:52,483 --> 01:00:53,567
Let's meet again.

652
01:01:00,449 --> 01:01:01,533
Meet again.

653
01:01:04,787 --> 01:01:05,788
We'll...

654
01:01:08,457 --> 01:01:09,500
meet again.

655
01:01:15,047 --> 01:01:16,048

656
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:21,136
This family

657
01:01:21,637 --> 01:01:22,971
will meet each other again.

658
01:01:26,225 --> 01:01:27,226
Really?

659
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:30,604
Really.

660
01:01:36,902 --> 01:01:37,903
Promise!

661
01:01:40,823 --> 01:01:41,824
Promise.

662
01:02:30,205 --> 01:02:31,540
My phone!

663
01:02:32,124 --> 01:02:33,125
Here it is.

664
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:38,672
My wallet!

665
01:02:40,299 --> 01:02:41,300
There it is.

666
01:02:51,852 --> 01:02:53,270
What is it this time?

667
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:16,668
Joon-ho.

668
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:30,349
I came to ask you something.

669
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,242
Why did you do it?

670
01:03:57,459 --> 01:03:58,460
Joon-ho.

671
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:00,754
Why did you kill me?

672
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:51,555
{\an8}Why the long face?

673
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:52,889
{\an8}I'm about to get fired.

674
01:04:52,973 --> 01:04:54,975
{\an8}Baek Dong-joo <i>ssi </i>is going to resign.

675
01:04:55,434 --> 01:04:56,935
{\an8}I said I'll say it.

676
01:04:57,019 --> 01:04:59,021
{\an8}I'll tell him I'll quit

677
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:00,897
{\an8}Please stop bothering me.

678
01:05:01,732 --> 01:05:04,026
{\an8}You haven't eaten in days.
You're worrying me.

679
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:06,403
{\an8}I can't think of anything else.
You two had a fight, didn't you?

680
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:10,699
{\an8}-Dong-joo from 2nd floor.
-I'm never going back there again.

681
01:05:10,782 --> 01:05:12,659
Let's go. The house is still empty.

682
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:14,494
Baek Dong-joo <i>ssi!</i>

683
01:05:14,745 --> 01:05:17,039
I can't stop thinking about you.
Genuinely.

684
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:23,003
<i>Next story is on Lee-ssi,</i>
<i>the husband of a pregnant woman</i>

685
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:26,632
<i>whose life was tragically taken</i>
<i>three days before she was due.</i>

686
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,343
<i>He had been missing for two days,</i>
<i>but later found</i>

687
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:31,887
<i>and rescued by a brave citizen</i>
<i>on the Incheon Bridge.</i>

688
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:35,766
<i>In the pressing moment that Lee-ssi had</i>
<i>climbed up the railing,</i>

689
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:39,394
<i>a citizen passing by noticed</i>
<i>and stopped his car.</i>

690
01:05:39,728 --> 01:05:43,273
<i>Without hesitation, he dashed</i>
<i>toward Lee-ssi and held his legs tightly.</i>

691
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:46,860
<i>One wrong move</i>
<i>and they both could've been in danger.</i>

692
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:51,198
<i>Eventually, he was able to hold Lee-ssi</i>
<i>with everything he had and rescue him.</i>

693
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:54,576
<i>The man, who insisted on</i>
<i>not revealing his identity,</i>

694
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:57,996
<i>left the site after giving his statement.</i>

695
01:05:59,206 --> 01:06:00,791
<i>I just wanted to give him a hug.</i>
