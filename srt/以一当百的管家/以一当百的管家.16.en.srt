Don't worry about that.
It didn't hurt one bit.

76
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,315
But, kiddo...

77
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,570
How did you handle all this hardship?

78
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,780
It must have been so hard.

How...

00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,707

But I got to meet you.

83
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:35,380
I... I got to see you like this, Dad.

84
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:38,925
Just once...

85
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:44,639
Just for... one minute...

86
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:48,810
I prayed and hoped

87
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,105
to see you again.

88
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,735
I prayed to let me

89
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,946
touch an eyebrow hair,
or even a little fuzz on you

90
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,574
before I leave

91
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,160
because I thought

92
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:10,624
I wouldn't be able to say goodbye.

93
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,168
I prayed and prayed...

94
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,966
I forgot for a short while

95
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:22,802
that my daughter

96
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,680
was a miracle.

100
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,111

101

-Dad.
-Hmm?

107
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,631
Just do a ponytail.

108
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:02,342
-Oh, should I?
-Yeah.

109
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:03,593
Okay, okay, got it.

110
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,692
Ugh... it tastes funny.

111
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:23,029
It's because you brushed your teeth.
That's why I didn't brush my teeth yet.

112
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:24,948
-Can I have one more?
-One more?

113
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,992
It'll taste fine now after the first one.

114
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,203
It's fine now, right?

115

-How'd it go?
-I bombed it.

118
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,545
Hey, it's fine! You're not hurt, right?

119
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:41,464
First place!!

120
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,091
Wow! Wow!

121
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,010
Yeah!

122
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,637

-You got it. Go wash up and wait a little.

125
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,437
I'll get it ready in no time. Wait, wait.

126
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,525
My precious daughter.

127
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:04,237
You're so young and full of life.

128
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:10,702
It feels like a waste
to even lay my eyes on you.

129
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:15,332
Dad, Dad, don't leave, please?

130

-Dong-joo.
-Hmm?

142
00:16:54,597 --> 00:17:01,271
This is the best I've done in 25 years!

143
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,189
You're right.

144
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,485
I wonder who you took this beauty from?

145
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,864
My daughter,
how could you be so beautiful?

146
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,993
I'm afraid you will wear out or disappear.

147
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,080
How beautiful you are, my baby.

148
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,750
So beautiful, I'm scared.

149
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:36,222
I should get going now.

150
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:42,187
No, please? Dad, don't go.

151
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,063
I want to stay too.

152
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,649
Yeah, so don't go.

153
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,359
I want to stay.

154
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:55,200
I want to have nice conversations
with my daughter every day,

155
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,244
and burst into laughter watching TV.

156
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:02,415
Get fried chicken delivered
on your paydays,

157
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,796
and eat tangerines
until our fingertips turn yellow.

158
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,923
And stay longer...

159
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:16,179
Kiddo, I want to see you get married,

160
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:19,390
watch you give birth and raise a child.

161
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,937
I even wanted to watch you
slowly become a grandma.

162
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:29,359
I know. So please don't leave me, Dad.

163
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,152
Just like you are

164
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:34,155
Baek Dal-shik's daughter,

165
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:39,536
me leaving is only natural,
the circle of life.

166
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:43,873
-There's no way to go against it.
-I don't believe that!

167
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:49,003
Please just once, just once...

168
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,425
Everyone has to send off their parents
before themselves.

169
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,638
Your dad experienced it,
and your uncle experienced it.

170
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,934
It is just a matter of time,
depending on the person.

171
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:04,978
It's a natural thing,

172
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,730
just like the seasons changing,
or days becoming nights.

173
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:11,484
But...

174
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,363
it was

175
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:17,866
a bit early for you, kiddo.

176
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,160
My poor baby.

177
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:23,746
But that doesn't mean

178
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,749
you should live with a bitter heart.

179
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,002
Don't let this

180
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,629
affect you too much after I leave.

181
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:36,676
No, I...
Then take me. I'm gonna follow you.

182
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,013
Your mother would never forgive me.

183
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,599
Your mom's Dad's pair, you know?

184
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:48,897
I was going to go and brag
about how beautifully I raised our child,

185
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,025
and ask if she was watching us.

186
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,405
-Dong-joo.
-Yes.

187
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:01,576
You have to go
to that amazing person next to you.

188
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:05,622
You have to live well, live happily.

189
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,249
That's all I want from you.

190
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,002
Just that one thing.

191
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:15,882
Let's

192
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:18,176
meet again.

193
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,596
Let's meet again

194
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,307
in the next world.

195
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:29,646
Meet again as my daughter. Let us.

196
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,399
Next time,

197
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,319
I won't make it as hard.

198
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,672
COFFIN ROOM

199
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:13,314
Dad!

200
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:15,650
No!

201
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,325
You can't come.

202
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:27,328
Stay there.

203
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:38,881
Daddy...

204
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,197
I love you, kiddo.

205
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,867
More than anything in the world.

206
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:09,579
Me too.

207
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,249
I love you too, Dad.

208
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:20,965
Goodbye.

209
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:00,273
Brother-in-law.

210
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,441
Have a shot.

211
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:14,787
I went to seminary from <i>Maehyeong</i>'s house.

212
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:20,251
It was shortly after <i>Noona </i>passed
and Dong-joo was just born.

213
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:25,047
It was probably hard enough
taking care of a newborn baby.

214
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:32,930
I wonder why he wanted to take care of
his bereaved wife's smelly little brother.

215
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,184
I eat <i>a lot</i>, you know.

216
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:39,937
I would eat an entire bale of rice a month

217
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:42,690
but he never once so much as glared.

218
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:45,651
It was actually the opposite.

219
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:52,200
He was sobbing at the ordination,
asking me, "Don't leave, don't go."

220
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:58,247
The senior priest commented
that he thought the cathedral had flooded.

221
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:08,633
He was a brother

222
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,427
and a father to me too.

223
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:15,264
He was shade from a tree for me.

224
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:18,309
He is gone so suddenly.

225
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,775
Instead of taking care of me,

226
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,653
he should have gone out on dates.

227
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:33,032
He should have
found himself a girlfriend, man.

228
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,117
Speaking of...

229
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,286
Why didn't Dong-joo's father

230
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,163
get remarried?

231
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,251
He thought it would be
a bad omen for Dong-joo's marriage.

232
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:59,225
Now, should we clean up
the visitors' room?

233
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:02,186
-Sure.
-Let's go.

234
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:40,933
Excuse me.

235
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:48,357
If I may ask,
how are you related to my brother-in-law?

236
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:51,944
I'm sorry.

237
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,532
I'm so sorry.

238
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,618
I am...

239
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:01,871
That is, I am...

240
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,806
I'm her mother.

241
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:25,603
I knew it would be rude of me to come.

242
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,191
I knew that no one would welcome me.

243
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:32,526
But I couldn't just sit around.

244
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:36,197
I've come because
I just had to do something.

245
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:42,203
I will stay and leave like air,
invisible and unnoticeable.

246
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,081
I'm sorry.

247
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,876
I'm so sorry.

248
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:55,966
He should be

249
00:27:58,052 --> 00:27:59,303
in heaven, right?

250
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:03,015
He would have gone

251
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:04,809
to a better place, right?

252
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,144
Of course.

253
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,189
Thank you very much for coming.

254
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:15,653
Thank you. And I'm so very sorry.

255
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,696
I'm so, so sorry.

256
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:23,786
I'm so sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

257
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:25,246
Thank you.

258
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:30,876
Thank you, thank you. I'm sorry.

259
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,462
What a noble death.

260
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,718
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

261
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:46,642
Mr. Baek made us
all kinds of purses and bags.

262
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:47,935
I know, right?

263
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:52,773
He made us leather purses
and shoulder bags.

264
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:56,694
Occasionally some knockoffs just for fun.

265
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:59,196
Yeah, but wasn't it way too obvious?

266
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:02,199
He probably used better leather
than the real ones.

267
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:05,327
I still carry it around.

268
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,746
Me too.

269
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:40,112
Now we say our farewell
to Mr. Baek Dal-shik.

270
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:45,284
But we are consoled
in the hopes for the joy

271
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:49,455
of meeting each other again someday
within God.

272
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:55,794
Therefore, the farewell we say
here and now is...

273
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:57,880
love,

274
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:01,467
and to lessen our pain.

275
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:07,097
Now we must let the deceased...

276
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:11,060
The deceased...

277
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:16,732
Brother-in-law...

278
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:19,652
Brother.

279
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:24,532
Brother...

280
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:29,828
Goodbye.

281
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,500
Thank you for being my brother-in-law.

282
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:39,964
Please rest in peace
with no worries about Dong-joo<i>.</i>

283
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,300
You're home now, kiddo?

284
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,678
What took you so long?

285
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,599
I grilled some hairtails,
they've all gone cold.

286
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:34,977
Dad.

287
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,979
It tastes better warm.

288
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:10,179
Just eat this one.

289
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:13,641
-I brushed my teeth already.
-You can brush 'em again after.

290
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:15,142
I'll have it tomorrow.

291
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:19,104
Man, what a hard life I live.

292
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:22,107
It's so hard to please my dear daughter.

293
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,615
<i>On a lonely day</i>

294
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:33,118
<i>You were left alone</i>

295
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:36,872
<i>I'm sorry</i>

296
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:44,129
<i>By your side</i>
<i>When you have no one to lean on</i>

297
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:49,301
<i>As a small consolation</i>

298
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:52,680
<i>Please let me stay...</i>

299
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:53,764
That's tasty.

300
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,725
<i>After that long night</i>

301
00:32:57,768 --> 00:33:02,147
<i>When your tears stop flowing</i>
<i>Then again</i>

302
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:04,483
<i>Goodbye</i>

303
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:37,141
I thought Brother-in-law might get jealous
if he finds out you two are here alone

304
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:39,143
so I brought company.

305
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:42,646
Let's head inside.

306
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:48,318
-I'm the guest, so...
-Ouch!

307
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,990
-I said I'm going first.
-Go ahead, go ahead.

308
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,915
He piggybacked her home that night
and was bedridden for like ten days.

309
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:04,752
No way it was ten days, it was like two!

310
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:06,044
It was ten.

311
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:07,796
Brother-in-law called crying

312
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,508
that after piggybacking you,
there was not a body part that was okay.

313
00:34:11,592 --> 00:34:14,178
How drunk were you,
to be carried home by your father?

314
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:18,932
Oh, that was the first time
I drank, when I was 20.

315
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:21,143
I drank with Jung-hwa with no awareness

316
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:22,936
and wow... I thought I was gonna die.

317
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,355
It was fortunate your father found you.

318
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:26,815
Apparently I called him.

319
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:29,777
He was saying that on the hill
on his way home

320
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,821
that he wanted to throw
his own daughter on the ground.

321
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:35,032
I know that feeling very well.

322
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:37,576
Right, he said something else...

323
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:40,329
It was like, "I'm disowning you
if you drink again!"

324
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:43,290
Wow, what an exaggeration!
He didn't say that.

325
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:44,374
What was it then?

326
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:48,212
I don't think he said anything particular.

327
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:52,090
I think I just
went out drinking with Dad more,

328
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:54,092
saying I need to learn from an adult.

329
00:34:54,468 --> 00:34:57,763
I went to street bars and pubs with Dad.

330
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,519
Brother-in-law was such a great father
when you think about that.

331
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:06,480
If it were me,
I would have broken your leg.

332
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:12,402
Of course,

333
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:14,071
he's a really cool dad.

334
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:17,282
My friends are all jealous.

335
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:30,587
Oh, speaking of,
should we go buy more beer?

336
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,297
Oh, sure.

337
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,138
Thank you, Brother Cousin.

338
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:44,142
-It's nothing.
-I'm glad...

339
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,938
that brother-in-law
got to see you before passing.

340
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:57,281
Please take care of our Dong-joo.

341
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:25,559
Oh, my Lord!

342
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:26,935
Oh, man, what is that?

343
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:29,104
Oh, my heart!

344
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:32,024
Goodness.

345
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:52,502
Jeez, he collected all these.

346
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:10,145
WISH-GRANTING COUPON

347
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,779
DAD
THANK YOU!

348
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:23,742
Whatcha doin'?

349
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,126
Guess what this is.

350
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,253
What is it?

351
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,759
<i>But, brother, what are you</i>
<i>going to do with all that money?</i>

352
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:44,680
I want to get her a nice set of furniture
when she gets married.

353
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,099
Man, Dong-joo is so lucky.

354
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:49,601
Right? If I do this for another few years,

355
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:52,229
I think I can even get her
a nice car on her way.

356
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:58,527
But... I think she found someone.

357
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,155
-Someone?
-Yeah.

358
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,825
How did you...

359
00:38:32,436 --> 00:38:33,437
Dong-joo...

360
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,772
You need to be happy.

361
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,234
Your dad lived only for that.

362
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:54,226
Ugh.

363
00:39:56,394 --> 00:40:00,816
Brother-in-law's legs were way too short.
My feet were so cold all night.

364
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:03,401
Uncle, don't you have to go to church?

365
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:04,486
Of course I do.

366
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,279
Did you sleep well?

367
00:40:06,822 --> 00:40:07,823
Yes.

368
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,449
Uncle?

369
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:11,743
Yeah, I'm done.

370
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,830
Man, it was like a storm,
so early in the morning.

371
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,456
Dong-joo, you're up.

372
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,916
-Good morning.
-Morning.

373
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,710
-You should've gone home.
-It was an emergency.

374
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,796
-Let's get going.
-Hmm? Where?

375
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:23,880
Let's just go.

376
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,969
Oh, yeah. We also have work to do.

377
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,888
-Let's go.
-I also...

378
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:35,851
want to request a job.

379
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,671
<i>This kimchi was made by my father.</i>

380
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:06,590
<i>Please keep him in your hearts.</i>

381
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,967
<i>Baek Dal-shik's daughter, Baek Dong-joo.</i>

382
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:11,428
Thank you, Father.

383
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:17,475
Thank you.

384
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:35,619
-Ye-seo.
-Yes?

385
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,455
The glint in your eyes is
just like Dong-joo's.

386
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:41,166
Who is Dong-joo?

387
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,836
-It means you're doing well.
-Okay.

388
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:47,547
Here you go.

389
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,133
Enjoy.

390
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:52,052
Yes, thank you.

391
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:53,553
Have a good one.

392
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:01,186
-Is Dong-joo well?
-Yes.

393
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,396
Did she start the exam prep?

394
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:05,649
I think she's debating.

395
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:09,527
Office position?

396
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:13,448
Yeah, he asked me
to offer you this for the time being

397
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:18,411
since you can also prepare
for the civil exam simultaneously.

398
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:22,916
Office position...

399
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:28,004
Would it remind you of your father?

400
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,840
No, it's not that...

401
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:34,094
And it's good to be reminded of Dad.

402
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:49,109
Isn't Dad amazing?

403
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:51,820
CERTIFICATE OF APPRECIATION

404
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:53,530
He saved four lives.

405
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:58,576
To rescue a person,

406
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:01,746
to save their life,

407
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,499
is such a meaningful thing to me.

408
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:10,505
You're also capable of it.

409
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:44,080

410
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:51,755
Tae-hee.

411
00:43:52,714 --> 00:43:53,715
What?

412
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:56,676
I got a reply.

413
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,679
-Huh?
-Come, fast, fast, fast.

414
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:02,390
Sit down.

415
00:44:04,017 --> 00:44:05,560
What does it say, Director Kim?

416
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,397
"Hello, Vincent."

417
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:13,818
"Your words, 'May I help You,'
touched my heart."

418
00:44:13,902 --> 00:44:16,863
-Touched their heart!
-"I would like to discuss investment...

419
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:19,908
...seriously. Let's have a meeting.
Please come to Pangyo."

420
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:21,826
Pangyo?

421
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:23,953
Pangyo?!

422
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:30,543
Of course, of course!

423
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:33,421
-Hurry, tell them I'll be there.
-Wow, is this possible?

424
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,550
But Uncle, do you have something to wear?
Don't you only have joggers?

425
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:38,968
This kid!

426
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:43,139
I may not look like it
but I even have a custom-made suit!

427
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:47,936
Your hair, your hair! Your hair right now
is very business unfriendly.

428
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:49,562
You may need a little hair cut.

429
00:44:49,646 --> 00:44:53,775
Of course!
Come on, send it fast. 'O,' 'b,' yeah?

433
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:28,726
Hello, Eonju University Hospital
Funeral Home.

434
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:32,689
<i>How much does it cost for a funeral?</i>
<i>It's pretty urgent.</i>

435
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:36,985
I see. Who might it be that has passed?

436
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:41,865
<i>Not yet, but I think I'm pretty close.</i>

437
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,743
<i>I was diagnosed</i>
<i>terminally ill a few years ago.</i>

438
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,873
<i>But I don't think I will last much longer.</i>

439
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:55,879
<i>I called to ask about the funeral costs</i>
<i>for my son who'll be left alone.</i>

440
00:45:56,463 --> 00:45:58,256
I see...

441
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:03,803
<i>I only have 1,000,000 won.</i>
<i>Will it be enough for a funeral?</i>

442
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:05,263
BUDGET PLAN A: 3,000,000 WON

443
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:09,809
Yes, of course.

444
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:14,898
Um, my name is Baek Dong-joo.
I would like to give you my number.

445
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:16,399
Are you able to take notes?

446
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:24,699
Wait, wait, wait!

447
00:46:25,158 --> 00:46:26,743
Huh? What's wrong?

448
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,786
How are you so audacious? Huh?

449
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:30,497
Only cut a little bit.

450
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:33,791
-Okay.
-One millimeter.

451
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:35,543
-One millimeter--
-Only cut one millimeter, please.

452
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:37,587
Are you cutting your hair or not?

453
00:46:38,505 --> 00:46:40,924
I... I will, but...

454
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:47,055
Now that I'm here, let me cut your hair.

455
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:49,641
You cut your ridiculous hair
right now. Cut your hair!

456
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:57,815
Okay, Mom! Let's live in Gangnam!

457
00:46:57,899 --> 00:47:00,401
-Cut it off!
-Okay.

458
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:03,446
Wait, wait, five millimeters.
Just five millimeters!

459
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:08,785
-Just cut it off, please. All of it.
-What do you mean all of it?!

460
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:09,994
Look forward.

461
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:13,831
I'll make you look refreshing.

462
00:47:13,915 --> 00:47:15,375
-Okay.
-No, not refreshing--

463
00:48:57,894 --> 00:48:59,479
Let's go, Pangyo branch!

464
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:05,943
Depart!

This is a notice from Kim Tae-hee from ER.

Male, 35, fallen from

internal bleeding by stomach inflation.

Low blood pressure as well. Yes.

471

Make way for the patient!

472
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:19,934
He needs a sonogram
and 3 milligrams of oxygen.

473
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,686
-A lot of blood packs too.
-Yes.

474
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:23,688
Let's put him in the ICU for now.

When is your day off?

478
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:56,220
Today.

479
00:50:59,307 --> 00:51:00,308
Huh?

480
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:04,520

I'm here to see you. How's the work going?

494
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,838
It's good, but a little boring.
I want to go back to funeral directing.

495
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,718
I guess we have the same fate.

496
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:02,847
We can have two or three weddings,

497
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:06,058
but there is
only one funeral in someone's life.

498
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:11,397
I really love that moment
where everyone becomes equals.

499
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:17,737
And we get to spend
their last three days with them.

500
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:23,993
I wonder if it's been
decided by a higher power?

00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:30,708

00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:45,486
Jung-ran! Goodness, are you okay?

530
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:58,374
<i>A security guard who delayed</i>
<i>his own escape for the rescue of another.</i>

531
00:56:58,874 --> 00:57:00,126
Here's a wet handkerchief.

532
00:57:05,673 --> 00:57:08,551
-Help us!
-Help us!

533
00:57:08,634 --> 00:57:10,928
-Help us!
-Help us!

534
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:12,096
There's a child over there.

535
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:14,640
Can you change my funeral portrait?

536
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,273
<i>A factory worker</i>
<i>that reported the location of survivors.</i>

537
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:24,817
I'll go in, so take these people outside!

538
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:40,374
Are you okay, ma'am?

539
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:43,544
Are you okay? Let's get out of here.

540
00:57:48,007 --> 00:57:49,008
One moment.

541
00:57:50,301 --> 00:57:53,095
<i>A firefighter who</i>
<i>gave away his own oxygen mask.</i>

542
00:57:53,179 --> 00:57:54,180
Breathe.

543
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:55,890
<i>My dad</i>

544
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:59,894
<i>quit his job as a firefighter in order</i>
<i>to take care of me in the hospital.</i>

545
00:58:01,604 --> 00:58:02,605
I'm sorry.

546
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,526
<i>Don't be sick there.</i>

547
00:58:11,906 --> 00:58:14,700
Are you all right?
Let's get out of here. Let's go.

548
00:58:26,295 --> 00:58:27,838
It's okay.

549
00:58:40,226 --> 00:58:44,104
FROM EMPLOYEES OF BONGSU ELECTRIC
MAY THE DECEASED REST IN PEACE

550
00:58:44,772 --> 00:58:45,898
Yes, yes, Tae-hee.

551
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:48,317
It'll all be fine.

552
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,444
It's all right, Grandma's here now.

553
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:06,919
At this rate, the baby is also at risk.

554
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:09,672
Send her in for a C-section.

WITHIN THE TRAGEDY THAT KILLED 21 LIVES
A PRECIOUS NEW LIFE IS BORN

561
01:00:04,977 --> 01:00:06,270
<i>The good deeds of many</i>

562
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:09,815
<i>and the kind</i>
<i>and beautiful nature of humanity</i>

563

<i>have all created a miracle.</i>

564
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:51,982
-Chief Mourner, sir.
-Yes.

565
01:00:53,442 --> 01:00:56,945
Is there a song
that your mother liked in her life?

566
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:01,617
I thought it would be good
to have it play during the departure.

567
01:01:03,035 --> 01:01:04,203
You do things like that?

568
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:13,337
My mother really loved Lee Moon-sae.

569
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:16,715
Which song would you like?

570
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:19,885
"A Poem for a Poem."

571
01:01:30,396 --> 01:01:32,606
Then the rest is...

572
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:35,192
Yes, I'll take care of it.

573
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,873
<i>Your heart, as soft and smooth as skin,</i>

574
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:35,002
<i>though it may be</i>
<i>a harsh and overwhelming life,</i>

575
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:39,590
<i>if you embrace that beautiful heart</i>
<i>and live through the day...</i>

576
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:43,677
This is the perfect medium size room.

577
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,805
It's about 2,500 square feet
and allows up to 60 guests.

578
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:49,808
Oh, I would've liked you to see
the VIP room on third floor,

579
01:02:49,892 --> 01:02:51,935
but it's in use,
so we'll do that next time.

580
01:02:52,019 --> 01:02:53,729
-Okay.
-Let's head over this way.

581
01:03:01,153 --> 01:03:04,531
Um... This is the coffin room.

582
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:07,993
It's in use by a funeral director
at the moment,

583
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:09,953
so we'll come back to this room.

584
01:03:16,877 --> 01:03:19,880
<i>...you can meet Dong-joo.</i>

585
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:29,890
I...

586
01:03:34,353 --> 01:03:36,438
I think I'm seeing ghosts.

587
01:03:38,065 --> 01:03:39,525
For more than 15 years...

588
01:03:43,904 --> 01:03:46,532
...15 years I've worked,
nothing like this happened!

589
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:52,371
I touched the deceased,
and they just... woke up.

590
01:03:57,292 --> 01:03:58,919
What should I do about this?

591
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:03,423
What do I do?

592
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,051
Did you see the number?

593
01:04:09,137 --> 01:04:10,138
Huh?

594
01:04:16,937 --> 01:04:17,938
Father?

595
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:20,732
Yes.

596
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:27,864
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>Miracles are always by our side.</i>

597
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:34,162
Respiration is back.

598
01:04:45,257 --> 01:04:46,258
<i>Are you alive?</i>

599
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:48,176
<i>Are you dead?</i>

600
01:04:51,722 --> 01:04:53,765
<i>How may I help you?</i>
