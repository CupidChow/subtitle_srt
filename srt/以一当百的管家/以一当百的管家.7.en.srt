1
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:32,283
A DIME A JOB

2
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:35,035
It’s breezy and nice today.

3
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:37,288
It is?

4
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,374
Didn't you say you like the rain?

5
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:43,419
I lied.

6
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:45,963
Why would you lie about that?

7
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:48,924
I don't know.

8
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:51,677
It was nonsense.

9
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:01,729
Since it’s raining,
are you down for a seafood pancake?

10
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:06,734
Yes, with makgeolli?

11
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,069
I’m down.

12
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,531
Kim Tae-hee!

13
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:31,759
<i>Sir, look at me.</i>

14
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,471
It’s acute stroke. Go fast.

15
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:37,807
-Are you a doctor?
-Yes, please go as fast as possible.

16
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:45,940
Hello.

17
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,240
I should leave now.

18
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,453
Have we met before?

19
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,288
I think I’ve seen you before.

20
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:04,041
Um...

21
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,751
Last time...

22
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,419
at the bridge.

23
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:10,297
Yes! With your flowers?

24
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:11,465
Yes.

25
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:58,637
Since when did you like the rain?

26
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:02,558
Who’s that girl?

27
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:06,103
2nd floor.

28
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:07,563
I see.

29
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,231
Do you have more vacant rooms?

30
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,358
I want to move in too.

31
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,120
Vincent’s so cute.

32
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,000
How’d you get here?

33
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,711
I saw at the hospital.

34
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,009
How have you been?

35
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:38,719
How are you?

36
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:43,390
Don’t you care to ask those questions?

37
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,354
I assumed you’d be well.

38
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,397
You thought about me?

39
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:29,561
Are you a red ginseng? An energy booster?

40
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,481
Two hot Americanos, please.

41
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,567
How can someone take this many shifts?

42
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,488
How can someone’s wish
be five hours of sleep?

43
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,949
Please put ice in one of them.

44
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,534
-Just one?
-Yes.

45
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:45,536
I’m not good with hot drinks.

46
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,329
Thank you.

47
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,957
Babe, why do you keep ordering it hot?

48
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,584
-Just order it with ice.
-No.

49
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,629
No, okay. Drink it hot.

50
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,631
Fine.

51
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:05,389
Why can’t you be like this?

52
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:08,600
You have no in-between.

53
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,353
There's no cooling down.

54
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,564
Why’s it either too hot...

55
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:15,399
Or too cold for you?

56
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,280
You just have to wait.

57
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:24,992
It’ll become warm.

58
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:27,327
It'll cool down.

59
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,168
Just give it some time.

60
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,423
Do you still think

61
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,134
it’s your fault?

62
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:58,734
Is it because of me?

63
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:00,778
-No.
-See.

64
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,156
Time doesn’t heal everything.

65
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:08,619
Time has passed and you’re still not okay.

66
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:13,749
Do you need more time?

67
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:11,890
SHE HAS APPEARED

68
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:28,949
Oh my God, my stomach.

69
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,326
I’ve had too much makgeolli.

70
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,371
I need hangover food.

71
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:41,753
Hey.

72
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,672
What are you doing?

73
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,008
It’s hot. I’m just trying to cool off.

74
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:49,720
Hey, you idiot, move!

75
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:53,056
Polar bears are suffering
because of fools like you.

76
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:08,488
COLD MEDICINE

77
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,117
Are you insane? You’re underage.

78
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:14,578
-It’s not for me.
-Whatever.

79
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,414
-Just give it to me.
-It's not for you.

80
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,125
-Damn it. Just give it to me.
-I said leave.

81
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,294
Next, please.

82
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,091
There are customers waiting.

83
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:48,111
A DIME A JOB

84
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,407
What? Father?

85
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,117
Goodness. Brother!

86
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,329
-What brings you here?
-What about you, Brother?

87
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,791
This is a small company I’m running.

88
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,501
And I live on the 2nd floor.

89
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:04,795
A Dime A Job?

90
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,421
Kim Jip-sa?

91
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,675
-Are you looking for Kim Jip-sa?
-Yes.

92
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,512
Hey! Come here!

93
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,681
Hurry.

94
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:20,269
This is Kim Jip-sa. He’s also my nephew.

95
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:22,896
Nice to meet you.

96
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,273
That’s a relief.

97
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:25,857
-A relief?
-What?

98
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:30,779
What I’m saying is, I’m glad to meet you.

99
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,531
Nice to meet you.

100
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,324
Yes, nice to meet you too.

101
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,993
Hey, he says he knows you.

102
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,453
-He knows me?
-Yes.

103
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:42,541
Um... I got your business card before.

104
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,669
And I thought it was creative.
I couldn’t forget it.

105
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:47,546
Thank you.

106
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:51,091
See, I told you.
We need to put more effort in marketing.

107
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,262
Father, do you need anything?
What brings you here?

108
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,346
Well...

109
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,850
-Uncle.
-I’m here to see my niece.

110
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,188
Niece?

111
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:11,361
I ask for your blessings
over our children of A Dime A Job.

112
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,113
Please be the shelter.

113
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:17,409
Please let A Dime A Job thrive
and help the children to love

114
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,412
and to be happy.

115
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:25,375
Almighty Lord, the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

116
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:29,004
Please bless all those
who are gathered here.

117
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,923
Prayer of repentance. Amen.

118
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:33,925
Thank you all.

119
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,178
Father, thank you so much.

120
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:40,223
I wanted a blessing especially
because it’s my first business.

121
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,184
It’s been too long
since I’ve visited the chapel.

122
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,061
So I didn't have the courage.

123
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,522
But I received a great blessing,
thanks to Dong-joo.

124
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:49,691
Goodness. I’m rather grateful

125
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:52,361
that Dong-joo has great neighbors.

126
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,570
I’m relieved.

127
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,530
Of course, put your mind at ease.

128
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:56,865
Thank you.

129
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:57,991
I’ll see you--

130
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,535
-Father.
-Are you okay?

131
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,288
Yes, here. I can do it.

132
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,210
Father, are you okay?

133
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:12,172
I’m fine, but I’m afraid
Dong-joo would hit me.

134
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:32,192
Father, since you’re here already,
feel free to look around our office.

135
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,944
I’d love to,

136
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,322
but I have plans
with Sister Director. Next time.

137
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:41,034
Sure, we’ll have everything ready
and invite you over soon.

138
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:45,163
That’s wonderful.
But, why don’t you visit the chapel first?

139
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,541
Come with your nephew, Brother.

140
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,502
There’s no pressure, just come to eat.

141
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:55,006
Our chapel is famous for the food
in the Bongsu district.

142
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,261
Then I’ll make sure
to drag this fool with me.

143
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,388
-What?
-Are you going to the chapel?

144
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:02,556
-Yes.
-I'll drop you off.

145
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,640
No, that’s fine.

146
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,227
I’m heading to Bongsu Park anyway
for a dog-walking errand.

147
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,020
I'll drop you off on the way.

148
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:10,856
-No.
-Come on.

149
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:11,982
It’s fine.

150
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,109
-It’ll be quick.
-Go by yourself.

151
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,119
-I’ll get going.
-Okay.

152
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,246
I’ll see you again, nephew Brother.

153
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,595
I didn’t know your uncle was a priest.

154
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,054
I see.

155
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:46,892
Cold?

156
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:48,643
No.

157
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,520
Is it because
you got hit by rain yesterday?

158
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:53,982
Please go to the hospital.
You’re making me feel bad.

159
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,194
You don’t need to feel bad.

160
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,654
Let’s grab jjamppong later.

161
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,366
Don’t you want to do
anything else than eat with me?

162
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,535
So, are you down? Or no?

163
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,915
I know you want to go.

164
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:14,544
Isn’t it that way?

165
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,088
Come here real quick.

166
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:24,429
Are you serious? 1234?

167
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,598
It’s simple and nice.

168
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,059
That’s too easy.

169
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:34,397
Pick another one.

170
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,029
And not 5678.

171
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,156
How’d you know?

172
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,700
Come on, put more thought into it.

173
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:47,869
Use eight numbers.

174
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,875
And not 12345678.

175
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,715
-Goodness. And no birthdays.
-Whoa.

176
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,094
Again.

177
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,771
I'm done.

178
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:21,653
Try it.

179
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,947
Do you think I’m an idiot?

180
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,658
I used a date I’d never forget.

181
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,243
Okay, so try it.

182
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,792
I said it's fine.

183
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,130
One more thing.

184
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,968
I know, I’m considerate.

185
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:50,974
So cool...

186
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:53,893
I know, I am.

187
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:55,854
What the...

188
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,189
I’m talking about the doctor.

189
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,360
I saw the doctor at the bridge.

190
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,946
A man was in a critical situation,

191
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:08,575
and she just ran over and handled it.

192
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:12,370
She was speaking English
to the paramedic, telling him to hurry.

193
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:16,458
Oh! And she just threw her bag
that looked very expensive.

194
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,084
That’s who she is.

195
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,295
She has that side to her.

196
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:23,590
Is she your friend?

197
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:25,050
Yes.

198
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,221
How do you have a friend like her?

199
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:31,723
She’s an alumni.

200
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:37,896
-Your first love?
-Yes.

201
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,564
Yes?

202
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:43,485
Oh, your first love?

203
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,447
No wonder she looked like
the type to be someone’s first love.

204
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,116
If I were a boy, I’d like her too.

205
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:52,702
First love.

206
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:57,916
It's done.

207
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,217
<i>I’m Dong-joo’s dad.</i>

208
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,762
<i>Can I see you?</i>
<i>Wherever is more convenient for you.</i>

209
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,641
We’re going to eat jjamppong, right?

210
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,935
I’ll call you after work.

211
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:25,985
First love...

212
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:30,657
Goodness.

213
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:34,202
I said I'd go. You didn’t have
to come here in this hot weather.

214
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,413
It’s fine. I had plans nearby.

215
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,580
I see.

216
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:40,291
I wanted to thank you for that day.

217
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,128
You saved my life.

218
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,422
I almost died.

219
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,674
You haven’t told Dong-joo, right?

220
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,300
I haven’t said a word.

221
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:54,055
No wonder. If she knew,
then she would’ve killed me.

222
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,015
Okay.

223
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,226
I wanted to thank you.

224
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,896
I know I can’t repay you with this,

225
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:04,274
but this is all I can give.

226
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:09,237
I heard you started studying again,
but I saw you with a paper bag.

227
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,573
I hope you like it.

228
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,827
Thank you. I like it a lot.

229
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,580
I don’t know if I should take this...

230
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:21,374
I’m bribing you.

231
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,170
-Excuse me?
-She asked to give her time until Fall.

232
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,882
So if she doesn’t pass the exam,

233
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,177
I’m going to tell her
to come back after the Fall.

234
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:36,097
You two are neighbors, so I hope
you can take good care of her.

235
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:38,850
Oh, no.

236
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,603
I’m not trying to pressure you.

237
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:45,982
I just wanted to you to watch out for her.

238
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:48,067
No, it’s not that either.

239
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,738
Well, honestly...

240
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:57,494
I’m just worried because she got a job
at a bad place before.

241
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:00,538
I see.

242
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:13,134
<i>-Your first love?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

243
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:35,907
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

244
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,408
My mom’s inside, right?

245
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:38,827
Oh...

246
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,037
Yes.

247
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,626
TREATMENT ROOM

248
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:54,133
It was ridiculous.

249
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:55,718
Oh, you're here.

250
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:01,683
-Dr. Choi, I must bring my car out.
-Okay, I’ll be right there.

251
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,936
Chung-ha, join us for lunch.

252
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,688
We’ve never had a proper meal together.

253
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,690
I don’t have free time.

254
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:12,193
Right, you’re busy. See you around.

255
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:22,579
Stuck with him again?

256
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:26,499
Watch what you say.

257
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,962
Don’t act like a kid
who’s never gotten love from her parents.

258
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:36,384
I’ve had stepfathers probably more than
there are players on a soccer team.

259
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,970
When will I have a chance
to learn anything?

260
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,764
You seem busy. Why’d you need me?

261
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,227
Here.

262
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:48,187
Do-ah furniture's third son.

263
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:51,816
He studied abroad in the States
and it's not been long since he flew back.

264
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,818
Does he gets physical with girls?

265
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,069
Or does he do drugs?

266
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:59,365
-What?
-Why would he meet someone like me?

267
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:00,909
It's obvious.

268
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:03,745
I don’t need a guy.

269
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,371
I’m not like you.

270
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:14,464
Is this because of that bastard?

271
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,717
You’re still not over him, are you?

272
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,761
Stop holding onto someone who left you.

273
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,680
You’re better than that.

274
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,101
What do I have?

275
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,438
I don’t have anything

276
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:33,691
or anyone who’s on my side.
I don’t even have normal parents.

277
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,193
I don't have anything.

278
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,945
He was always on my side.

279
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,364
He was all I had.

280
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:44,327
Chung-ha.

281
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:46,079
Chung-ha!

282
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,596
CHUNG-HA

283
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:15,692
{\an8}A DIME A JOB

284
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,537
REQUEST TO EAT LUNCH

285
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,628
Can I have medicine for the flu?
For coughing.

286
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,383
Yes, where are you?

287
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:43,052
<i>I’ll have to take</i>
<i>a rain check for jjamppong.</i>

288
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,179
<i>I’m sorry, something came up.</i>

289
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,808
I see. Okay, that’s fine.

290
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,940
COLD MEDICINE

291
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:42,862
Eat.

292
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:48,451
Why aren’t you eating?
You can’t live without jjamppong.

293
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:53,748
And it rained yesterday.
You should eat when you’re feeling down.

294
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,503
Don’t do this ever again.

295
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:04,217
My mom has a new boyfriend again.

296
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:13,601
You know I have nobody else to talk to.

297
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,272
I couldn’t think of anyone else.

298
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,234
Just you...

299
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,239
So...

300
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:29,325
Can't you just feel bad for me?

301
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:49,345
<i>Dong-joo. I was wondering</i>
<i>if you can make time for me today.</i>

302
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,514
<i>I want to have lunch with you.</i>

303
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:14,996
<i>Il-seob, our baby has heart disease.</i>

304
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:17,373
<i>The heart is larger than normal.</i>

305
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:20,793
<i>And the lungs, liver,</i>
<i>and kidneys aren’t functioning.</i>

306
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:25,298
<i>Transplant is the only solution,</i>
<i>but it’s hard to find a newborn donor.</i>

307
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:28,342
<i>Il-seob, can you lend me 30,000,000 won?</i>

308
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:30,428
<i>There’s a shaman ritual</i>
<i>in Gampo that can help.</i>

309
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,388
<i>A Sea God can save our baby.</i>

310
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:36,017
<i>Just 50,000,000 won.</i>
<i>I’ll pay you back. I’m serious.</i>

311
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:39,687
<i>I'll do anything. I’d even sell my organs.</i>

312
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,314
<i>I'll pay it back.</i>

313
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:45,776
<i>Please leave a voicemail...</i>

314
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,910
-Hello!
-Goodness. You scared me.

315
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,621
You remember me, right?
You haven’t forgotten?

316
00:24:57,246 --> 00:25:00,249
Right. You're the granddaughter.

317
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,753
I'm Yoo So-ra.

318
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,380
Can you take this? It’s heavy.

319
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,508
What is this?

320
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,928
I’m not telling you.

321
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:14,096
Presents should be a surprise.

322
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,225
A present? You didn’t have to--

323
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:18,309
Please take it.

324
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,978
You’ve sent my grandma to heaven.

325
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:24,232
So-ra...

326
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:28,194
I’m sure she went to heaven,
but it’s not because of me.

327
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,696
-I can’t take this.
-It’s nothing bad.

328
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,740
I'm

329
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:35,660
far and square, Yoo So-ra.

330
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:38,246
I’ll back off for today.

331
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:39,914
Hey.

332
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,667
Don’t tell Baek Dong-joo. I trust you.

333
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,336
Hey!

334
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:51,467
What is it?

335
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:00,184
<i>You’re always busy</i>
<i>taking care of other people.</i>

336
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:02,311
<i>But not yourself.</i>

337
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:07,233
<i>That’s why I’m trying to take care of you.</i>
<i>Please don’t skip meals.</i>

338
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,026
<i>Love, Yoo So-ra.</i>

339
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:17,702
What the?

340
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:18,995
What is it?

341
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:20,788
Who ate all this?

342
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:23,124
Your daughter, who else?

343
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,001
This much?

344
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,421
Is this leaking?

345
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:35,303
It's nothing much, but take it.
It's vitamins.

346
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,722
It’ll give you strength.

347
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:40,683
That’s fine, you should eat it.

348
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:42,893
I don’t need this.

349
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:44,687
Here.

350
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:48,733
Your body and your heart work together.

351
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:52,153
If your body aches,
then your heart aches and vice versa.

352
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:55,990
That’s why you must
take care of your body.

353
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,120
Even if that’s for me.

354
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:05,249
Dong-joo,

355
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:07,460
I like it when you smile.

356
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:13,299
All my problems go away
when I imagine your smile.

357
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,217
Thank you.

358
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:19,513
No need to thank me.
I couldn’t even make it to our movie plan.

359
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:21,057
I'm a bad person.

360
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:35,613
REQUEST TO EAT LUNCH

361
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:53,631
Jeez. The ramen looks even more delicious
when I’m with you, Dong-joo.

362
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:58,302
Wait.

363
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:00,179
Isn’t that...

364
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:06,477
Yes, the bully.

365
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,979
Goodness. He must’ve ditched class.

366
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,316
Officer, can you catch him?

367
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:15,903
He always buys cigarettes
in his school uniform. How shameless.

368
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:20,991
He could’ve at least changed out
of his school uniform before he buys it.

369
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:23,119
I should teach him a lesson.

370
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:26,789
Wait.

371
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:28,916
Isn’t that Tae-hee?

372
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:35,965
Did you order the cigarettes?

373
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,426
Did a man call you?

374
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,138
I think I saw you
at the convenience store earlier.

375
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:43,722
What about the cigarettes?

376
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,227
Isn't Tae-hee getting beat up by him?

377
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,479
He'll figure it out.

378
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,898
I should step up.

379
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:55,484
Hae-an.

380
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,154
Well...

381
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:01,574
I should get going.

382
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:06,579
You haven't eaten anything.

383
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,331
I'm sorry.

384
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,625
Goodness...

385
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,338
I'm really sorry.

386
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:18,174
I'll buy you food next time.

387
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:22,219
That's too bad, but it's fine.

388
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:24,263
-You should go.
-Okay.

389
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,056
You said you grant anything.

390
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,766
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

391
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,311
Get there safe!

392
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:35,649
Jeez. What should I do with that kid?

393
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:42,281
Hey, Tae-hee!

394
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:45,409
What the?

395
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:47,828
I'm so happy to see you here.

396
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:49,497
Hello to you too, bully.

397
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:53,834
Don't waste your time here.

398
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:56,420
Drop off Dong-joo.
She says that she's busy.

399
00:29:58,047 --> 00:30:01,467
I'll take care of him.
Hurry and go. She's busy.

400
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:04,970
She's over there! Please take care of her.

401
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:13,729
How about lunch?

402
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,065
Did you eat lunch?

403
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:19,235
Yes.

404
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:22,196
I couldn't eat.

405
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:25,324
Why are you lying?

406
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:29,537
I'm serious.

407
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,290
Drop me off here.

408
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,794
-Here?
-Hurry.

409
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:58,566
<i>The person you have reached...</i>

410
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:00,484
Why isn't she picking up?

411
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,572
Family members should eat first.

412
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:06,615
Visitors should be here anytime.

413
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,866
Sure.

414
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:22,715
Her granddaughter's not picking up.
I hear she cared for her the most.

415
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:25,968
Dong-joo.

416
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:28,637
Yes. Is she here?

417
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:30,639
Who?

418
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:34,101
Oh...

419
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:35,352
Hey.

420
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,647
Choose one.

421
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:41,442
Either eat that jjajangmyeon.

422
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:43,652
Or answer your phone.

423
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:46,488
Goodness. You're driving me nuts!

424
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:49,116
It's been ringing non-stop.

425
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,119
Jeez.

426
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:56,165
Do you think I'm your secretary
who answers your phone?

427
00:31:57,333 --> 00:32:00,961
Goodness. A little kid bossing me around.

428
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:03,505
-Hello--
<i>-You idiot!</i>

429
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,341
<i>-Where are you?</i>
-What the?

430
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:08,761
This is the police station.

431
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:17,686
What's wrong with you?

432
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:25,736
I'm Chang-wan's uncle.

433
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,947
Thank you for bringing him here with you.

434
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:31,825
Show the officer some respect.

435
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:34,411
That kid.

436
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:37,164
I apologize.

437
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:40,501
That's fine.
I was like that at his age too.

438
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,881
I'll get him, so you should stay here.

439
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:50,803
Hey, kid.

440
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,054
Chang-wan.

441
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:55,474
That stubborn kid...

442
00:32:58,352 --> 00:32:59,520
Dong-joo.

443
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:01,480
You must be
having a hard time because of him.

444
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:03,315
No, it's fine.

445
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:09,071
You're blinded by love.

446
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:13,409
Dong-joo and I have a strong relationship.

447
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,161
That bully is the cupid for our love.

448
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:18,247
He's helped us get involved again.

449
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:20,874
I can see right through you, man.

450
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:25,754
You can't follow her to work,
even if you like her that much.

451
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:28,257
Girls hate that the most.

452
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:30,592
How burdensome and uncharming.

453
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:33,595
You're frustrating.
I'm telling you, it's not that.

454
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,098
I really went there to see the bully.

455
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:38,559
I saw Dong-joo there by coincidence.

456
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:41,103
Why do you care about that bully anyway?

457
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:43,564
Just...

458
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:45,691
He reminds me of me.

459
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:49,445
He has no parents and no friends.

460
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,447
He lived with his grandma for a long time.

461
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,992
Since he moved into his uncle's house
after graduating elementary school,

462
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,536
he's been having a hard time.

463
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,664
He should be
more thoughtful of his grandma.

464
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,125
He gave her a really hard time.

465
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:04,710
So frustrating...

466
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:11,383
Back in my heyday, I was pretty too.

467
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:15,220
People said I was like a Narcissus.

468
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:17,556
And a deer too.

469
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,601
Men would stand in line to see me.

470
00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:23,353
You saw my funeral portrait, right?

471
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:25,314
Yes, you were so beautiful.

472
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:26,815
-Right?
-Yes!

473
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:30,360
You have a good eye.

474
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:33,238
It's a bit awkward to say this,

475
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,408
but it's the best funeral portrait
I've ever seen.

476
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,452
-Is that so?
-Yes.

477
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:41,914
But...

478
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:45,334
-Can...
-Yes?

479
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,339
Can you change my funeral portrait?

480
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,549
What?

481
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:56,553
I've chosen the one
she looked the best in.

482
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:59,181
And we already put her in a coffin.

483
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:03,143
We're moving you
to the grave tomorrow morning.

484
00:35:03,227 --> 00:35:06,355
Goodness. Can you just change it, please?

485
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:10,275
Don't you know good skin
is all a girl can ever want?

486
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:11,360
But...

487
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:14,279
Your freckles are too visible.

488
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:15,989
This is more than enough.

489
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:19,117
We've already photoshopped it once.

490
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,078
My eyes aren't even...

491
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:23,580
She has aged beautifully.

492
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:25,874
My face looks unbalanced...

493
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:28,961
You're funny.

494
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,255
Sir.

495
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:34,508
I apologize. She's still new.

496
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:37,135
She made a mistake. I'm sorry.

497
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:38,846
I was just wondering.

498
00:35:39,388 --> 00:35:40,681
Wondering if it was possible...

499
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,224
What do you mean?

500
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:46,478
Change it.

501
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,359
Please change my grandmother's portrait.

502
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:58,323
Please change it.

503
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:01,493
I beg you.

504
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,415
Just this one time.

505
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:26,643
Goodness.

506
00:36:26,727 --> 00:36:30,355
I've worked as a director for 20 years.
It's the first time changing the portrait.

507
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:31,565
I'm sorry.

508
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:34,443
I'll take the bus and come back quickly.

509
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,236
You can't take a bus there.

510
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:39,156
Gapyeong is basically in the countryside.

511
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,866
Then I'll take a taxi.

512
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:43,577
I've called A Dime A Job.

513
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:44,995
So go with them.

514
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,538
What?

515
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:48,123
The boss is coming.

516
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:49,625
I see.

517
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:52,002
Send the picture right away.

518
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,171
I'll change the portrait fast.

519
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:55,422
Yes, sir.

520
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:56,673
I'll get going.

521
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,008
Okay.

522
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,306
A DIME A JOB

523
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:36,713
I thought the boss was coming.

524
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,423
Well,

525
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,885
our boss has a hard time driving at night.

526
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:44,680
I see.

527
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:10,247
<i>Dongnam rest area 600 meters ahead.</i>

528
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:13,959
Should we stop by the rest area?

529
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,293
No, that's fine.

530
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:20,424
Aren't you hungry?

531
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,094
I haven't had lunch today.

532
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:28,598
You did.

533
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:30,976
What?

534
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,811
I saw it.

535
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:36,231
-See what?
-You eating lunch.

536
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,441
I saw it.

537
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:39,735
With that friend.

538
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:53,081
I was working.

539
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:55,167
I didn't eat.

540
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:56,793
I see.

541
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:02,799
I'm sorry I couldn't make it.

542
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:09,139
But I didn't lie to you.

543
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:10,515
I'm serious.

544
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:16,688
Wait, there's one thing.

545
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:21,234
Earlier,

546
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:24,071
when I said our boss
has a hard time driving at night,

547
00:39:25,072 --> 00:39:26,073
I lied.

548
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,116
I said that I'd go.

549
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:30,077
I wanted to.

550
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:36,249
Why?

551
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:39,878
You don't need to know.

552
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,755
Is it because of me or something?

553
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:43,173
It's not that.

554
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:50,889
Wait.

555
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:53,058
There's a house.

556
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:57,813
I think that's it.

557
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:01,650
Should we go?

558
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:03,151
Sure.

559
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:21,253
Whoa.

560
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:35,809
What are you doing?

561
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:43,441
Give this to Chang-wan.

562
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:47,279
DORAGEE
HERBAL CIGARETTES

563
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:49,865
REQUEST TO BRING DORAGEE CIGARETTES

564
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:51,074
Doragee?

565
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:53,869
Where are the cigarettes?

566
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,120
No.

567
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:56,538
It's for my grandma.

568
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,790
You're using your grandma, seriously?

569
00:40:58,874 --> 00:41:01,084
I'm not lying. Why would I smoke that?

570
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:04,171
I want to give it
to my grandma. It's urgent.

571
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:07,090
-Kids these days...
-I don't have time.

572
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:12,220
I think she's going to pass away soon.

573
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:27,569
My baby.
He's probably going to blame himself.

574
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,654
He's going to feel bad.

575
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:32,199
DIPLOMA

576
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:33,950
You smell like cigarettes.

577
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:36,411
Let's take the picture.

578
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:38,038
Please look here.

579
00:41:38,622 --> 00:41:40,707
One, two, three!

580
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,417
I'm sure of it.

581
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,379
So could you please
change my funeral portrait?

582
00:42:51,695 --> 00:42:53,238
This is flipped.

583
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:54,239
KIM CHANG-WAN
1ST GRADE

584
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:00,620
Please look here. One, two, three!

585
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:12,132
9

586
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:17,387
<i>Please be happy.</i>

587
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:20,765
<i>My precious baby.</i>

588
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:48,460
I'm sure she'll like it.

589
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:53,048
I think Chang-wan will like it too.

590
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:59,429
Look ahead. The road is dark too.

591
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:02,265
Don't worry. This is my job.

592
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:03,850
I'm good at driving.

593
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:05,518
Jeez, seriously.

594
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:16,488
Wait. I think we're stuck.

595
00:44:18,782 --> 00:44:21,493
-I think you should go this way.
-Let me back up first.

596
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:26,706
Do something.

597
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:37,967
Oh my God!

598
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:39,302
Are you okay?

599
00:44:39,386 --> 00:44:40,720
Yes!

600
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:43,264
Are you hurt? Are you really okay?

601
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:45,433
Do you think I'd be fine?

602
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:49,437
Goodness. Do something!

603
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:52,941
Jeez. This is driving me crazy.

604
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:55,318
Hold on.

605
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:07,372
Please!

606
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:09,249
I'm sorry, hold on.

607
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:11,501
Wait, I can't do anything.

608
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:14,295
It's too dark here.

609
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:15,380
We're at...

610
00:45:15,505 --> 00:45:18,091
-I can't see anything.
-It's north of Daeryeongrin, Gapyeong-ri.

611
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:22,011
<i>Below the Soduk mountains?</i>
<i>Jeez. We can't go there now.</i>

612
00:45:22,095 --> 00:45:24,264
-I can't see anything.
-I thought so.

613
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:28,768
But we have to go back
to Seoul immediately. Isn't there a way?

614
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,854
I'll compensate however much you want.

615
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:33,606
<i>Even if you give me double, it'll be hard.</i>

616
00:45:39,279 --> 00:45:43,783
I'm sorry, sir.
I think it'll take a while.

617
00:45:43,992 --> 00:45:47,203
Okay. Please come
as soon as possible tomorrow morning.

618
00:45:48,163 --> 00:45:51,207
-Yes, sir. I'll call you.
-Okay.

619
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,296
Goodness.

620
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,339
What should we do?

621
00:45:59,466 --> 00:46:00,758
We're in trouble.

622
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:02,969
What's wrong?

623
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:05,972
-Are you hurt?
-No, I'm fine.

624
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:11,019
-What should we do?
-Seriously, what should we do?

625
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:17,984
<i>Even if it's uncomfortable,</i>
<i>you two should stay at my mother's place.</i>

626
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:19,986
<i>And come back tomorrow.</i>

627
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,655
<i>-I've made it clear.</i>
-Okay.

628
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:24,824
I'm so sorry.

629
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:27,410
And thank you.

630
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:31,998
What'd he say? Is he okay with it?

631
00:46:32,332 --> 00:46:34,834
Yes, he said not to worry and to rest.

632
00:46:35,502 --> 00:46:36,794
Does it hurt a lot?

633
00:46:37,629 --> 00:46:38,630
I'm fine.

634
00:46:41,508 --> 00:46:43,426
You're more brave than I thought.

635
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:45,929
I thought you'd be more scared.

636
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:54,812
What's wrong?

637
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:59,234
Why? Does it hurt? Where?

638
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:01,986
Why do you drive like that?

639
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:08,284
I told you it's dark here,
but you don't listen to me.

640
00:47:08,368 --> 00:47:10,161
I was surprised!

641
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:11,871
I was scared too!

642
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:15,333
Is that right?

643
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:17,919
I'm sorry. Lighten up.

644
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:19,337
-Okay?
-Whatever.

645
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:21,673
Let's hurry and go.

646
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:24,467
How can I go fast?

647
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:29,305
I'm hurt.

648
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:37,522
But...

649
00:47:38,982 --> 00:47:40,608
how are we leaving tomorrow?

650
00:47:41,693 --> 00:47:43,695
Do you think I'd make you walk?

651
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,114
Don't worry, okay?

652
00:47:46,698 --> 00:47:48,533
I'd piggyback you if I have to.

653
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:51,160
-You're joking again.
-"Joking"?

654
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:54,539
Why would I joke around
with you at this age?

655
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,085
Put more strength in your arms.

656
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:00,962
I'm getting tired.

657
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:02,922
I'm putting all my strength.

658
00:48:03,006 --> 00:48:04,007
-You are?
-Yes.

659
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,967
-Put more.
-I'm heavy, right?

660
00:48:06,676 --> 00:48:07,677
No, not really.

661
00:48:08,845 --> 00:48:09,846
I'm hungry.

662
00:48:10,597 --> 00:48:12,515
I told you
we should've eaten jjamppong earlier.

663
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:13,766
We should've...

664
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:18,313
Are you okay? Do you need help?

665
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:20,231
No, it's fine. I can do it.

666
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:21,524
It's no big deal.

667
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:23,776
Yes, it is.

668
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:28,031
I'm used to it. It doesn't even hurt.

669
00:48:31,034 --> 00:48:34,078
Well, this is why I quit.

670
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:36,456
Ping-pong.

671
00:48:44,297 --> 00:48:45,590
It must've hurt a lot.

672
00:48:46,341 --> 00:48:47,925
It's all over anyway.

673
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:49,552
It's done.

674
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:53,014
You have to take it easy.

675
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:57,602
The nerves around the injury
are weakened, so you can get hurt again.

676
00:48:57,894 --> 00:49:00,271
-So for two weeks, rest--
-Rest.

677
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:04,359
-And ice--
-Ice the area.

678
00:49:06,486 --> 00:49:09,113
What the? You talk exactly like my doctor.

679
00:49:09,197 --> 00:49:10,657
Are you a doctor or what?

680
00:49:19,499 --> 00:49:20,625
What's wrong?

681
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:26,839
Right, the classmate of yours...

682
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:29,717
You're really a doctor?

683
00:49:39,852 --> 00:49:40,853
A long time ago

684
00:49:41,688 --> 00:49:42,897
I was for a bit.

685
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:49,028
I'm not anymore.

686
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,281
You don't have to tell me.

687
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:58,413
But were you a quack?

688
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,627
You were getting a fever earlier.

689
00:50:05,795 --> 00:50:07,672
You don't even know you're sick.

690
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:32,572
TRADITIONAL SIKHYE

691
00:50:34,824 --> 00:50:35,825
Here.

692
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:39,162
It's made out of rice.
So think of it as a meal.

693
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:40,705
Conman.

694
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:43,124
It's better than running
on an empty stomach.

695
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:44,375
Drink it.

696
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:49,046
Hurry.

697
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,264
Here, take this.

698
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:02,602
I bought it because you looked ill.

699
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:06,022
I was supposed to
give it to you yesterday.

700
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:09,650
Thank you.

701
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:19,118
Drink it.

702
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:23,623
I'm glad I came today.

703
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:26,417
I doubt it,
especially with your driving skills.

704
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:27,960
Hurry and take them.

705
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:30,296
Okay.

706
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:38,805
Here.

707
00:51:40,181 --> 00:51:41,557
You should sleep now.

708
00:51:41,808 --> 00:51:43,643
-Here?
-Yes.

709
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:46,145
You should stay here. I'll sleep outside.

710
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:49,440
Goodness. Just sleep here, okay?

711
00:51:49,899 --> 00:51:52,777
Just get some sleep
so you can drive tomorrow.

712
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:55,696
-I can't.
-Jeez. I'm not the one driving.

713
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:57,949
Just sleep, okay?

714
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:01,327
Don't wake up.

715
00:52:06,249 --> 00:52:07,375
Jeez.

716
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:08,835
Here.

717
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,170
Sleep tight.

718
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:15,132
I'll get going.

719
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:17,510
Sleep.

720
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:57,049
<i>There's a clinic at the retirement home...</i>

721
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:01,345
What is it?

722
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:06,851
CHUNG-HA

723
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:20,406
Hello?

724
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:21,741
<i>Vincent.</i>

725
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:23,451
<i>It's me, Chung-ha.</i>

726
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:26,120
<i>-How've you been?</i>
-Chung-ha.

727
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:29,081
I've been good.

728
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:31,500
How about you?

729
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:35,254
Same for me.

730
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:39,383
Vincent.

731
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:41,886
Are you working these days?

732
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:43,346
Yes, well,

733
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:46,933
I've started an errand-running company
with Tae-hee.

734
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:52,355
Tae-hee...

735
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:54,941
Is he doing okay?

736
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:57,068
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

737
00:53:57,944 --> 00:54:01,113
<i>He's busy with work.</i>
<i>He's on a business trip right now.</i>

738
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:03,824
Business trip?

739
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:05,159
<i>Yes.</i>

740
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:08,454
I see.

741
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:11,082
Alone?

742
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:12,458
No, well,

743
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:14,460
he's not alone.

744
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:19,590
I was supposed to go, but he insisted.

745
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:22,218
I should've just went.

746
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:25,012
Want me to tell Tae-hee?

747
00:54:25,096 --> 00:54:26,305
<i>No, not at all.</i>

748
00:54:26,514 --> 00:54:27,515
It's fine.

749
00:54:30,518 --> 00:54:31,519
Okay, then.

750
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:00,464
Why aren't you asking?

751
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:03,759
Sleep.

752
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:09,140
Everyone else asks.

753
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:14,353
I'm like that too.

754
00:55:22,153 --> 00:55:23,237
Everyone

755
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:24,989
asks me too.

756
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:28,868
They ask why I quit ping-pong.

757
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:38,461
I've been playing ping-pong
since I was ten years old.

758
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:43,549
I played ping-pong
while everyone was studying,

759
00:55:44,133 --> 00:55:46,343
while they went on school field trips...

760
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:49,346
I've played ping-pong my whole life.

761
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:52,058
Why would I quit?

762
00:55:53,476 --> 00:55:55,519
It wouldn't have been for the good.

763
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,981
I had my reasons.

764
00:56:03,069 --> 00:56:05,196
That's why you don't have to tell me.

765
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:25,925
I'm not going to.

766
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,662
Even if I don't say...

767
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:03,546
What if I tell everything
to the girl who understands,

768
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:09,176
and makes me want to depend on her?

769
00:57:13,222 --> 00:57:15,558
What happens if I want to lean on her?

770
00:57:24,817 --> 00:57:26,152
Then what will I do?

771
00:58:25,878 --> 00:58:26,879
What the?

772
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:33,302
Where is he?

773
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:39,099
Goodness.

774
00:58:44,313 --> 00:58:45,439
Where is he?

775
00:58:47,233 --> 00:58:48,817
Where did he go?

776
00:58:55,366 --> 00:58:56,492
Did you sleep well?

777
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,121
How do you feel?

778
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:03,874
I'm good, thanks to you.

779
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:08,712
-How's your leg?
-I'm good, thanks to you.

780
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:22,768
When did you wake up and fix the car?

781
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:24,311
I need to hurry

782
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:26,021
before you start nagging me.

783
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:30,985
I just got promoted, so I might
get in trouble if I get any complaints.

784
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:32,820
Jeez. What do you take me for?

785
00:59:33,404 --> 00:59:36,323
I told you I'd piggyback you
if I had to and not to worry.

786
00:59:36,699 --> 00:59:37,950
Just don't get sick.

787
00:59:42,288 --> 00:59:45,291
Your body aches if your heart is aching.

788
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:51,505
You can lean on me
when you're having a hard time.

789
00:59:58,053 --> 01:00:00,973
You're doing it again. Look ahead.
We're going to get into another accident.

790
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:02,224
Right, okay.

791
01:00:39,595 --> 01:00:40,846
Goodbye, Grandma.

792
01:00:49,897 --> 01:00:53,609
DORAGEE
HERBAL CIGARETTES

HYUN JUNG-HWA
TABLE TENNIS CLUB

794
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:08,332
Why aren't you eating?

795
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:09,958
I don't need it.

796
01:01:10,042 --> 01:01:11,043
What?

797
01:01:11,543 --> 01:01:13,212
-Why?
-Well...

798
01:01:13,295 --> 01:01:16,298
She's gonna talk nonsense
about her prince or whatever.

799
01:01:16,882 --> 01:01:18,509
Why's that nonsense?

800
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:20,135
Can't a girl love a man?

801
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:24,807
I wonder who he is. Poor guy.

802
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:27,226
Hey, friend.

803
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:28,519
That's harsh.

804
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:29,978
Why do you pity him?

805
01:01:30,062 --> 01:01:33,273
I'm going to make him
the happiest man alive.

806
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:35,317
My grandma gave me a gift.

807
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:39,696
-She's gotten worse.
-Yes.

808
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:43,826
Do you two know

809
01:01:44,785 --> 01:01:46,954
how it feels to be concerned
about someone?

810
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:49,289
No.

811
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:53,877
Kim Tae-hee.

812
01:01:56,547 --> 01:01:59,007
<i>-Your first love?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

813
01:02:02,553 --> 01:02:04,596
You were getting a fever earlier.

814
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:07,141
You don't even know you're sick.

815
01:02:08,434 --> 01:02:10,686
<i>You want to take care of him...</i>

816
01:02:13,856 --> 01:02:15,190
More than anything.

817
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:17,568
You get butterflies.

818
01:02:18,569 --> 01:02:19,862
<i>Your heart beats fast.</i>

819
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:25,159
<i>Is it me instead of the grandma?</i>

820
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,454
<i>Don't worry, okay?</i>

821
01:02:28,996 --> 01:02:30,873
I'll piggyback you if I have to.

822
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:41,008
It's when you like someone.

823
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:48,640
You can have this.

824
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:51,101
I'm not even hungry.

825
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:35,604
WHERE ARE YOU?

826
01:03:42,069 --> 01:03:46,698
A DIME A JOB

827
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:08,512
Knock knock.

828
01:04:09,137 --> 01:04:10,138
Hello.

829
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:13,183
What brings you to our office?

830
01:04:13,267 --> 01:04:15,727
Well, I wanted to eat this with you.

831
01:04:16,228 --> 01:04:17,229
Sure.

832
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:19,648
-Would you like some coffee?
-Yes.

833
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:21,775
-Would you like it hot?
-I'd love it.

834
01:04:22,276 --> 01:04:23,318
You can sit there.

835
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:33,036
The place is bigger
and cleaner than I thought. It's nice.

836
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:37,165
You thought it'd smell
because it's just men?

837
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:40,961
We clean every night.

838
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:46,550
What is this?

839
01:04:46,633 --> 01:04:47,634
Macaroons.

840
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:52,681
Hold on.

841
01:04:57,686 --> 01:04:58,895
Should we kill?

842
01:05:15,287 --> 01:05:16,288
Should I kill?

843
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:18,582
I'll kill.

844
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:23,689
{\an8}<i>Yes, go kill. Now.</i>

845
01:06:23,772 --> 01:06:25,065
{\an8}<i>You</i>

846
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:26,566
{\an8}<i>really make me crazy.</i>

847
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,402
{\an8}<i>I'm the one not wanted.</i>

848
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:30,862
{\an8}<i>If you're curious</i>
<i>about a man's first love,</i>

849
01:06:30,946 --> 01:06:31,947
{\an8}<i>we need to cover it up.</i>

850
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:34,282
{\an8}<i>I don't know who it is,</i>

851
01:06:34,366 --> 01:06:36,660
{\an8}<i>but you must really love him.</i>

852
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:40,497
{\an8}<i>Let's meet often.</i>
<i>You don't need to worry about me.</i>

853
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:42,582
{\an8}<i>In that case, thank you.</i>
