=Episode 19=

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,960
With Bai Jiangbo's shares,

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,360
your stake has already exceeded 20%.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,840
At this point,

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,600
as long as you initiate the process
to impeach the CEO,

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,480
you can likely have the shareholders
to vote for you.

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,520
Now Bai Jiangbo has agreed to transfer
the shares to you,

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,280
but the contract hasn't been signed yet.

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,640
I'll push for it in the next couple of days.

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,620
(Hanxing)

15
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,200
Zhong Sihuai.

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,620
Zhong Sihuai!

17
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,460
Huh?

18
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,310
What are you doing?

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,160
Don't let Shen Hanxing affect you.

20
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,560
Didn't I tell you before?

21
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,680
- Oh.
- Are you not listening to me now?

22
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,600
No, no.

23
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,200
I...

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,600
I've always been listening to you.

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,320
How is that possible?

26
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,960
He's seriously injured,

27
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,360
won't wake up in a short time.

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,560
And

29
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,760
I don't understand,

30
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,080
whether he wakes up or not,

31
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,040
whether he goes back or not,

32
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,640
the will still take effect.

33
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,960
How can that work?

34
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,280
If the real He Chen goes back, of course
it won't work.

35
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,840
What about a fake one?

36
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,480
Very good,

37
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,030
you've grown.

38
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,480
Remember,

39
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,240
this car accident was arranged by me,

40
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,400
and you had no idea about it.

41
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,800
Okay?

42
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,440
Okay.

43
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,680
Whether you get Xinglan doesn't matter.

44
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,080
But He Can must stay.

45
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,520
We need him to play the role of He Can

46
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,160
in Heshi Group and manage it well

47
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,560
until the shareholders' meeting.

48
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,960
He will be our trump card at that time.

49
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,840
But he ruined my big plan.

50
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,200
What big plan?

51
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,080
Is it Shen Hanxing?

52
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,520
What is it?

53
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,520
Tell me!

54
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,560
It's

55
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,520
becoming the new owner

56
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,680
of the Heshi Group.

57
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,280
Remember that.

58
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,000
I don't want to say it a third time.

59
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,640
The previous address was exposed,

60
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,280
where did you move He Chen to?

61
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,120
You don't need to know that.

62
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,520
Your task now is to prepare well for the
shareholders' meeting,

63
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,760
and make sure you get the votes
from the shareholders.

64
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,640
Okay.

65
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,000
Shen Weixi has something on Zhong Sihuai?

66
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,520
It's a video.

67
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,720
No wonder Zhong Sihuai is helping her.

68
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,920
A video?

69
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,400
Hello?

70
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,080
- How's it going?
- We've figured it out.

71
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,880
The café is owned by Zhong Sihuai
and Liu Jingyao.

72
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,080
Do you know the café at the corner
of Xiaohe Street?

73
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,120
Yes.

74
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,640
Zhong Sihuai took me there before.

75
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,880
The owners of that café

76
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,640
are Zhong Sihuai

77
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,080
and Liu Jingyao.

78
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,000
That woman told me the same lie.

79
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,720
She wanted to kill me.

80
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,080
It's her.

81
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,320
Baby, you're awake.

82
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,680
Oh, you almost scared me to death.

83
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,480
Are you feeling any discomfort?

84
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,360
Don't be afraid.

85
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,800
The police have already filed a case.

86
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,560
Do you know who wanted to hurt you?

87
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,160
(It must be Zhong Sihuai.)

88
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,560
(But why did he keep He Chen there?)

89
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,400
(He said he's in a hospital.)

90
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,800
(He came to save me.)

91
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,320
(I knew he still cared about me.)

92
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,800
This was really too dangerous.

93
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,520
You dad and I will take you

94
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,280
and go pray at the temple.

95
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,280
Okay.

96
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,880
Mom, get me discharged.

97
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,040
Huh?

98
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,720
Jingyao,

99
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,760
I heard you were fired.

100
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,760
Sorry,

101
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,160
you helped me with the Xinglan acquisition,

102
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,000
but it got you fired.

103
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,000
It's fine.

104
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,440
I had been wanting to quit anyway.

105
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,000
So what's your plan now?

106
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,280
Have you found a job?

107
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,920
Not yet.

108
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,360
Hey,

109
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,320
why not fulfill your original dream

110
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,520
and open a café?

111
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,440
I think this café's location is great.

112
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,320
If you can rent it,

113
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,160
I can come here every day for free coffee.

114
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,200
Oh,

115
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,080
dreams should stay in the yearbook.

116
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,100
I'll just be an office lady.

117
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,440
Hot water, is it?

118
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,880
Let me pour it for you.

119
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,480
Thank you.

125
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,680
so no food this week.

126
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,080
After you finish it,

127
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,960
I'll bring you new food next week.

Also,

129
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,480
the shares and the votes are almost ready.

130
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,680
Don't rush,

131
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,320
wait a little longer.

132
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,280
Once I'm done with my tasks,

133
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,520
I'll bring you gifts.

did you miss me?

Have you been reflecting every day?

138

Why does it always heal so quickly?
