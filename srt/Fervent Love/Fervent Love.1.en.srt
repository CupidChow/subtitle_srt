Hanxing,

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,400
what are you doing?

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,020
(He Chen

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,060
(He Chen)

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,040
Hanxing!

6
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,680
Zhong Sihuai,

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,560
pay for what you did to He Chen!

10
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,340
(Three months ago)

11
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,200
Mr. He,

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,600
do we still return all the documents sent
from Mr. Bai?

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,020
(He Chen, CEO of Heshi Group)

14
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,570
Miss.

15
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,880
Miss, you can't go in.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,840
Miss,

17
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,440
you can't enter without an appointment.

18
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,320
Miss, Mr. He is busy right now.

19
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,520
Hey, Miss!

20
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,520
Miss!

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,480
He Chen!

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,920
We agreed to get married next year.

23
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,360
What is going on now?

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,760
I've already told you, it's over between us.

25
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,840
You must have a good reason, right?

26
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,400
(Heshi Group)

27
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,480
My reason

28
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,240
is the future of Heshi Group.

29
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,080
You're not fit to be the lady of the house.

30
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,570
Since that's the case,

31
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,320
let's do this with dignity.

32
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,040
Sign it,

33
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,160
and we'll break up.

34
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,020

The great heiress of Xinglan

36

asking for a breakup fee with her lover
right after coming home.

37
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,920
Five million,

38
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,600
it's worth it.

39

(Signature: He Chen)
(The handwriting is the same.)

40
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,480
Thank you for the five million,

41
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,920
cute little limper.

42
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,320
Take this hair and have it tested.

43
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,400
I want to expose him.

44
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,600
He can't be He Chen.

45
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,360
You are home.

46
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,640
Uncle,

47
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,240
your engagement is really sudden.

48
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,400
Are you afraid she might run off?

49
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,020
(Zhong Sihuai, COO of Heshi Group)
Mr. Bai

50
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,260
and the others said a few days ago
did have some points.

51
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,290
You need to listen to everyone's opinion more.

52
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,080
You weren't

53
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,320
like this before.

54
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,520
Go change into something more formal.

55
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,520
Okay.

56
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,000
No problem, Uncle.

57
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,280
Go on.

58
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,920
Let me formally introduce.

59
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,360
This is my fiancée,

60
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
Shen Hanxing.

61
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,480
Hanxing,

62
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,840
since university,

63
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,840
I've been looking forward to this moment.

64
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,000
Sorry,

65
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,280
back then, I didn't understand your feelings.

66
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,200
It's still not too late.

67
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,040
Although I know,

68
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,000
you got engaged to me to resolve

69
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,400
Xinglan's crisis,

70
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,920
but

71
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,160
I don't mind.

72
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,080
Hanxing,

73
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,560
marry me.

74
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,280
(Shen Hanxing,)

75
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,960
(what are you doing?)

76
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,840
You're something else,

77
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,400
Aunty Hanxing.

78
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,600
Aren't you afraid I'll tell Uncle

79
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,000
how you were trying to seduce me
in the room just now?

80
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,480
Hanxing,

81
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,120
you must be tired.

82
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,240
Change your shoes.

83
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,800
Hmm.

84
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,040
I'm not tired.

85
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,440
Let's go upstairs. The guests are waiting.

86
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,960
Mr. Zhong, may I speak with you?

87
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,000
Wait for me.

88
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,000
Can!

89
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,560
My boy!

90
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,640
How you been?

91
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,120
You miss me?

92
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,440
You've got the wrong person.

93
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,240
He Chen's father passed away long ago,
didn't he?

94
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,200
Who is he?

95
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,960
I am his father.

96
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,520
This is my boy,

97
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,960
He Can.

98
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,320
- Huh? He Can?
- He Can?

99
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,940
He Chen's twin brother?

100
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,780
How could this be?

101
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,000
Wasn't he kicked out by his father long ago?

102
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,200
Back in the day,

103
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,440
you and your mother were kicked out
of the house.

104
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,160
If it weren't for me,

105
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,600
how could you have survived until today?

106
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,920
Now you've become the CEO,

107
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,760
and you're unwilling to take care
of your father?

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,680
I've told you, you've got the wrong person.

109
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,840
I am He Chen.

110
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,480
What He Chen?

111
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,320
You have

112
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,840
a violin mark

113
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,600
left from

114
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,840
practicing.

115
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,080
This is impossible.

116
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,680
What did you do?

117
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,640
About that car accident,

118
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,800
I don't want to remember it anymore.

119
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,480
Please show some respect.

120
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,760
He doesn't know what he's doing.

121
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,720
Ridiculous.

122
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,120
Shut up!

123
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,520
I have evidence.

124
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,960
This is your old phone.

125
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,960
Dare to unlock it and see?

126
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,710
