6
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,320
Uncle,

7
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,120
today is the mid-term report
for the resort project.

8
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,520
Aren't we going to meet Mr. Kang?

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,520
Hanxing is busy today,

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,920
she'll be a bit late.

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,880
No rush,

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,800
let's wait for her.

13
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,440
This horse ranch

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,600
is one of the highlight projects
for the resort.

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,480
Mr. Kang loves horseback riding.

16
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,880
In the past,

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,800
you two often did it together.

18
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:03,760
I'm He Can.

19
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,600
Uncle,

20
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,440
did you forget?

21
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,720
I've never been to a horse ranch,

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,760
I don't know how to ride.

23
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,200
Yes,

24
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,280
I know,

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,840
but if Mr. Kang gets excited,

26
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,960
you have to keep up,

27
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,960
just give it a try.

28
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,880
Don't worry, it's not hard.

29
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,920
I'll arrange the gentlest horse for you.

30
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,080
You must be joking, Uncle,

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,550
this isn't as easy as memorizing something.

32
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,040
Previously,

33
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,880
you were in a wheelchair,

34
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,800
so Mr. Kang wouldn't bring up horseback riding.

35
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,680
But now that your leg is healed,

36
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,400
what do you think?

37
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,400
Here's the deal, Uncle,

38
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,520
I'll go arrange some equestrian training.

39
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,720
Maybe in a year...

40
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,440
Three months,

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,040
I can learn it in three months.

42
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,960
- But today...
- It has to be today.

43
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,680
No, Uncle.

44
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,160
This could be dangerous.

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,080
From what I know about Mr. Kang,

46
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,760
if he wants to invite us for a horse ride,

47
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,960
he won't talk about business.

48
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,120
Also, Shen Hanxing,

49
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,200
I mean, Aunt Hanxing told me that...

50
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,520
Tell me

51
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,840
who you are!

52
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,320
I...

53
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,560
I'm He Can.

54
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,600
You saved me and asked me

55
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,920
to pretend to be He Chen.

56
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,080
He Can is a cripple,

57
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,960
and he wouldn't call Shen Hanxing by her name.

58
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,480
My leg is just healed.

59
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,760
The doctor told you, didn't he?

60
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,040
I can't breathe.

61
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,480
Charles gave it to me.

62
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,840
Your suit is all wrinkled.

63
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,240
Go change.

64
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,840
(I'll find you,)

65
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,480
(He Can.)

66
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,880
Mr. Kang.

67
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,480
Hmm?

68
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,280
He Chen?

69
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,520
What's this?

70
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,000
How long has it been since you saw me
in riding gear?

71
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,800
It's been a long time indeed.

72
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,960
What's up,

73
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,960
feeling itchy today?

74
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,600
How about we have a little competition?

75
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,760
He Chen's leg is just healed,

76
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,800
the doctor advised

77
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,160
no intense exercise for now,

78
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,240
right?

79
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,440
You have to listen to the doctor.

80
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,480
Uncle is right,

81
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,480
I need to fully recover from this injury.

82
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,480
I'm just wearing this outfit

83
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,320
for fun today.

84
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,880
Maybe our competition

85
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,760
will have to be postponed.

86
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,040
Alright,

87
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,480
health comes first.

88
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,680
As for the resort's business negotiations,

89
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,920
I'll leave it entirely to my uncle.

90
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,400
You two talk, I'll go take a stroll.

91
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,600
Mr. Kang, please sit down.

92
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,220
Why are you here alone?

93
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,360
They're going over the contracts.

94
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,920
Your meeting is tomorrow,

95
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,960
and you came this early,

96
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,390
but didn't tell me?

97
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,200
Uncle arranged it.

98
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,200
You can ride too?

99
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,320
I never had the chance.

100
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,320
He Chen used to say,

101
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,800
learning equestrian skills requires time,
perseverance, and love.

102
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,880
You want to try it.

103
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,760
Equestrianism is a conversation of the soul,

104
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,120
from getting familiar with each other's scent
to running together.

105
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,480
It takes time.

106
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,440
Looks like you learned quite a bit
from my brother.

107
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,160
I looked over the art gallery proposal.

108
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,200
With you at Xinglan,

109
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,400
its future is bright.

110
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,240
We'll definitely put our heart
into your project.

111
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,480
Mr. Kang.

112
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,680
Ah, you've arrived!

113
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,160
Please,

114
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,000
you two lovebirds sit together.

115
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,760
Mr. Kang,

116
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,550
you may not know since you just returned
to the country,

117
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,760
but Mr. Zhong and I are engaged now.

118
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,000
Um...

119
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,000
That's right.

120
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,040
You're engaged?

121
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,890
Good news, good news!

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,960
Mr. Zhong is a capable man,

123
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,520
you're both fortunate.

124
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,080
Uh,

125
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,240
then, about this seat...

126
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,760
No worries, Mr. Kang,

127
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,520
the project is important.

128
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,040
We're all family,

129
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,360
we'll follow your arrangements.

130
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,640
Sit down.

131
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,480
Sit, sit, sit.

132
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,600
Alright,

133
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,000
let's eat and talk.

134
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,320
Should we decide the rough plan

135
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,120
based on what you and Uncle discussed

136
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,960
this afternoon?

137
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,600
Alright, no problem.

138
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,040
Mr. Kang,

139
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,720
last time, I wasn't feeling well,

140
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,640
and I ruined your mood.

141
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,440
Blind wine tasting?

142
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,840
Same old tradition,

143
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,040
we guess the grape variety.

144
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,880
This one,

145
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,520
the grape variety is

146
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,760
Pinot Noir.

147
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,600
Mazys-Chambertin.

148
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,400
This vineyard only produces Pinot Noir grapes.

149
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,240
Mr. Kang, you're amazing!

150
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,880
Mr. Kang, try this one too.

151
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,600
This one is...

152
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,200
Merlot.

153
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,240
Merlot?

154
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,000
The taste of Merlot

155
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,720
can be so special?

156
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,760
Everyone thinks

157
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,800
Merlot grapes

158
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,440
don't have much character,

159
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,600
and are just used as a blend.

160
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,240
But I think Merlot isn't without character.

161
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,120
With a careful and strict production process,

162
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,040
Merlot can shine

163
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,040
in its own way.

164
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,720
This wine is mostly Merlot,

165
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,040
but it should also have some

166
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,640
Cabernet Sauvignon blended in.

167
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,560
Cabernet Sauvignon, the king of red grapes,

168
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,120
can perfectly complements

169
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,880
Merlot's shortcomings.

170
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,640
So Merlot always needs the strong presence
of Cabernet Sauvignon.

171
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,000
Together, they're the best.

172
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,240
Tomorrow morning,

173
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,960
I'll have them transfer the third-phase funds
to you.

174
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,120
Also,

175
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,640
next year, the project

176
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,800
for the Winding Mountain Villa

177
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,720
is reserved for you,

178
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,000
my brother.

179
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,200
Mr. Kang,

180
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,960
Winding Mountain Villa is a big project,

181
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,960
we'll do our best.

182
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,080
You can count on us.

183
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,160
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

184
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,920
By the way,

185
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,680
remember when we first met,

186
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,320
you often went to that little tavern,

187
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,520
the one you recommended to me?

188
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,560
What was it called?

189
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,720
The little tavern?

190
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,040
I remember it had

191
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,440
