6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,640
I finally turned things around for Xinglan,

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,160
and now you want to give this money
to Shen Weixi?

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,040
Weixi is your own sister,

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,200
she's not an outsider.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,880
And she is looking for new opportunities
abroad.

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,040
Besides,

12
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,600
I'm the general manager of Xinglan.

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,880
Do I need to report to you

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,320
at every project I invest?

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,960
Exactly, Hanxing,

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,880
we're all family.

17
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,280
Stop nitpicking.

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,320
Family?

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,680
When did you ever treat me as family?

20
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,040
Have you ever supported me?

21
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,160
You're just worried that I won't give you money
if Xinglan is managed by me.

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,080
You're using my mother's hard work

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,320
to support a bunch of parasites.

24
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,440
Shen Hanxing,

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,560
what's with this attitude?

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,840
Investment?

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,040
Mr. Shen, do you mean the MX Streetwear Factory

28
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,320
that Shen Weixi started up abroad
with Flagfish?

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,200
Mr. He?

30
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,280
Yes, yes.

31
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,320
That is it.

32
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,920
Flagfish is a subsidiary invested
by Heshi Group.

33
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,240
From what I know,

34
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,640
the MX Streetwear Factory project had failed
six months ago.

35
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,280
What happened?

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,960
Flagfish's semi-annual report looked
really bad.

37
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,480
As for why the project failed,

38
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,200
it should be because Shen Weixi

39
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,680
signed the contract

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,880
but didn't do her job.

41
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,920
She just squandered

42
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,760
her money,

43
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,240
buying luxury stuff.

44
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,440
When she got abroad, she was still the same.

45
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,760
He Chen,

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,720
why didn't you tell me all this before?

47
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,120
Telling you this would only cause you
more trouble.

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,840
When starting a business,

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,280
everybody faces obstacles.

50
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,520
Weixi

51
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,880
is trying hard.

52
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,520
It looks like I need to talk to
some industry friends.

53
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,000
Our Heshi Group suffered a loss from Flagfish,

54
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,640
and I don't want my friends to follow
the same path.

55
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,160
Companies with an unprofessional

56
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,600
family-run management style

57
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,680
carry too much risk.

58
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,320
No, no, no, Mr. He,

59
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,600
please calm down!

60
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,600
Cheng Qiuyu,

61
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,000
look at what your daughter has done.

62
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,400
Call her back now.

63
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,600
Also, starting today,

64
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,840
you stop being Xinglan's manager.

65
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,240
About today,

66
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,400

I'm fine.

and now you are sleeping.

Oh.

87
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,080
Ah,

88
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,080
I'm so tired.

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,920
Oh.

00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,360
I'm not eating anything.

91
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,960
Next week, many media will attend

92
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,200
Xinglan's art exhibition,

93
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,480
Shen Hanxing will also be there.

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,840
Find some people

95
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,120
to cause a scene there.

96
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,480
Lu.

97
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,560
Yeah, Miss Shen.

98
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,080
Here, this one just arrived.

99
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,000
Take a look.

100
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,120
This one.

101
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,560
We're really interested in this painting.

102
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,560
If The Sea Under the Mist is still available,

103
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,840
it should also appear here.

104
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,960
Are you regretting it?

105
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,800
No.

106
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,720
Selling it saved Xinglan, which was worth it.

107
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,400
Mr. He,

108
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,120
actually, I've never really understood.

109
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,040
Why would you auction it,

110
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,680
increase the price, then buy it yourself,

111
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,280
and then give it to Miss Shen?

112
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,280
The auction will increase its value,

113
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,880
making it worth more.

114
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,720
So you're trying to help Miss Shen?

115
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,040
No,

116
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,880
purely for fun.

117
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,800
Another art exhibition?

118
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,440
Everything here is fake.

119
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,200
Hey, film me!

120
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,400
Hey, hey, hey!

121
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,160
I bought something here,

122
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,600
but ended up losing a lot, you know?

123
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,520
The person in charge is Shen Hanxing.

124
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,760
Shen Hanxing, come out

125
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,680
and explain!

126
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,000
That is me.

127
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,280
What do you want?

128
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,320
Do you have

129
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,720
any receipts for the paintings

130
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,960
you bought from us?

131
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,560
I'm not listening to your nonsense,

132
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,720
give me a straight answer.

133
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,360
- Let go!
- Will you pay me or not?

134
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,600

142
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,160
When did

143
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,160
his leg heal?

144
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,520
The school has been exposed.

145
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,360
Has he been moved?

146
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,040
Don't worry, he's been moved.

147
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,800
But there's no clue about the man in

148
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,280
the surveillance footage.

149
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,560
There's new progress on the resort project.

150
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,440
Mr. Kang specifically requested

151
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,000
for Shen Hanxing to help.

152
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,200
I didn't expect

153
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,480
Mr. Kang always

154
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,040
thought so highly of Shen Hanxing.

155
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,360
He's been wanting to give her

156
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,480
the responsibility of the

157
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,320
resort's art gallery section.

158
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,520
I know the resort project is important to you,

159
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,480
so I had to go along with Mr. Kang's wishes

160
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,920
and ask Hanxing to help.

161
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,240
Originally, with this puppet helping, the task

162
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,400
of buying back the shares from
the shareholders

163
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,400
should be much easier than expected.

164
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,520
But now it seems,

165
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,080
he might be hiding something from you.

166
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,400
Will he be out of control?

167
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,480
Do you want me to investigate?

168
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,440
Not for now.

169
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,040
Why?

170
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,080
His father might wake up any minute.

171
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,280
Time waits for no one.

172
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,520
You take care of the share acquisition first.

173
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,400
Okay.

174
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,400
(He Can,)

175
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,880
(could it be you're He Chen?)

176
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,320
Why did you save me?

177
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,520
Just doing the right thing.

178
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,880
You don't think I'm worried

179
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,480
about you, do you?

180
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,080
Anyway,

181
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,400
thank you.

182
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,280
The condition of my leg got exposed.

183
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,880
One thank you isn't enough.

184
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,320
Last time I helped you,

185
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,800
so now we're even.

186
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,000
That's unfair.

187
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,960
Sihuai,

188
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,080
you don't know,

189
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,160
today, it was all thanks to...

190
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,480
It's all thanks to He Chen.

191
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,560
I know.

192
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,880
Thank you.

193
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,760
No problem.

194
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,840
Why didn't you tell me

195
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,240
you leg's healed?

196
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,880
I've only just been able to stand on my feet.

197
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,800
I just haven't told anyone yet.

198
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,160
The CT results show that

199
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
your leg needs to be observed.

200
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,600
For the next few weeks,

201
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,320
stay in the hospital and rest well.

202
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,200
No matter what,

203
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,760
your leg is healed,

204
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,120
that's the best news.
