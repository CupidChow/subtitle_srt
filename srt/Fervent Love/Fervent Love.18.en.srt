He Chen,

7
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,720
do you know what I named it?

8
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,480
I just remembered,

9
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,920
I never told you.

10
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,680
I left the name of this wine

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,160
It's called Fervent Kiss.

21
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,320
You are drunk.

22
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,320
Then why did you give me Xinglan?

23
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,520
You said you'd give me freedom,

24
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,240
give me Xinglan.

When I said I'd give you freedom,
I meant to let you go.

29

I didn't think that much.

30
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,680
