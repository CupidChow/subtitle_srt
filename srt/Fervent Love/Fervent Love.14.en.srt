(Dr. Huang be here?)

8
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:39,930
He Can,

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,120
I saw you.

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,880
Didn't you went to Xinglan?

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,960
I thought you went to the company.

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,280
Dr. Huang is a fugitive.

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,280
How could you come alone?

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,160
Aren't you here alone too?

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,640
Are you here?

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,520
Cash on delivery.

17
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,720
I'll be there soon.

18
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,960
Who is he dealing with?

19
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,000
Zhong Sihuai.

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,440
I'll go check upstairs.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,840
Wait for me here.

22
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,920
I'll go with you.

23
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,600
Don't worry,

24
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,520
it's easier for me to act alone.

25
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,400
Hello?

26
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,680
Didn't we agree to...

27
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,320
What are you doing?

28
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,320
Stop!

29
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,350
Stop!

30
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,200

Hand over your phone!

32
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,940
Give it to me!

33
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,280
Don't touch her.

34
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,200
Don't come any closer.

35
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,840
Calm down.

We're not here to catch you.

Do you think I'm a fool?

38
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,560
Let go of her. We'll ask you a few questions.

39
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,760
If it's money you want,

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
we can offer double.

41
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,080
- I keep my promises.
- That woman told me the same lie.

42
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,000
She wanted to kill me.

43

Why?

84
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,400
Is it because

85
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,080
you're uncomfortable seeing
the other two people

86
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,160
at home together?

87
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,640
You know Cheng Qiuyu hit me.

88
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,040
Then you should know that my relationship

89
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,520
with Shen Weixi is not good.

90
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,040
Actually, from the moment you agreed
to let her move in,

91
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,960
I wasn't happy.

92
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,320
I've endured it for a long time.

93
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,320
I don't want to endure it anymore.

94
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,120
And Xinglan is getting on track now,

95
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,840
so there's more work to be done.

96
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,170
I'll move out

97
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,390
so I can focus on my work.

98
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,520
After all,

99
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,080
my future focus is on Xinglan.

100
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,760
Sihuai.

101
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,800
Okay.

102
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,760
We've been trying marriage for a while.

103
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,360
Maybe you should move out

104
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,520
and prepare.

105
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,800
Then let's get married.

106
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,280
Anyway,

107
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,640
you'll be moving back in.

108
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,920
How have things been with He Can recently?

109
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,480
What's his attitude toward you now?

110
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,880
You still have the nerve to ask me?

111
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,120
You said you'd help me,

112
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,040
but what did you do?

113
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,080
I allowed you to move in,

114
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,080
but you failed to do your job.

115
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,520
He cares about you less than he does
about Hanxing.

116
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,120
You really are

117
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,920
always losing to your sister.

118
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,000
What do you mean by that?

119
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,200
Did you forget

120
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,520
what I have in my hands?

121
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,760
Don't misunderstand.

122
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,400
I'm just being anxious for you,

123
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,960
wanting to stoke the fire.

124
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,160
If I let He Can

125
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,640
agree to let Cheng Qiuyu

126
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,440
bring Xinglan as your dowry...

127
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,620
Then Shen Hanxing will be furious.

128
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,800
I get it now.

129
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,850
