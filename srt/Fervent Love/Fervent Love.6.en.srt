=Episode 6=

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,000
(It's a dream.)

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,440
Hanxing,

8
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,320
come have breakfast.

9
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,600
I came back late last night.

10
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,400
I went to your room to check on you

11
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,680
and smelt alcohol there.

12
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,360
Did you drink last night?

13
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,560
Yes.

14
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,560
I had a drink with Lawyer Liu.

15
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,200
We haven't seen each other in years.

16
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,800
Hanxing,

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,800
Lawyer Liu isn't much for small talk.

18
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,160
She never mentioned it to me.

19
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,200
Did anything happen

20
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,640
later last night?

21
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,880
Nothing.

22
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,520
Last night,

23
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,280
after drinking, I took a taxi home,

24
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,480
and went straight to sleep.

25
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,360
But, Hanxing,

26
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,320
you must tell me

27
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,000
next time when you drink.

28
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,960
Okay.

29
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,600
Then I'll call you after drinking.

30
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,440
You have to be ready to answer.

31
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,880
Of course.

32
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,520
I'll head to the company.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,960
The fingerstall with

34
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,160
the fingerprint is done.

35
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,160
(The fingerstall is ready.)

36
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,120
(Now I just need that key.)

37
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,440
(I need to go to)

38
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,720
(Zhong Sihuai's room again.)

39
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,880
You are alone?

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,840
It's so late,

41
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,720
aren't you scared?

42
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,880
We are heading to KTV.

43
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,040
Come with us.

44
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,480
Don't touch me.

45
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,840
Come have fun with us.

46
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,240
What are you pretending for?

47
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,640
Leave, or I'll call the police.

48
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,480
Go ahead.

49
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,330
Let me go!

50
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,880
Help!

51
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,240
Help!

52
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
Help!

53
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,520
Let her go!

54
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,160
Who are you?

55
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,320
He Chen?

56
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,000
So you do want to find my brother's shadow
in me, huh?

57
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,520
So every day, you're facing me

58
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,720
with this thought?

59
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,520
Shut up.

60
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,320
If you don't mind,

61
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,520
I can act as your He Chen for a day.

62
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,640
Don't think you can scare me like this.

63
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,360
Yeah,

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,400
you're fearless.

65
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,680
You even dare to play tricks
in front of my uncle.

66
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,520
If you really want to find He Chen,

67
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,520
then stick to our agreement.

68
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,680
You're so loyal.

69
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,200
Does your uncle know you are faking

70
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,360
your leg problem?

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,120
Looks like you've got plenty of

72
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,600
secrets you're hiding from your uncle.

73
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,680
You're quite

74
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,280
an incompetent puppet.

75
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,560
Tell me,

76
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,640
why are you pretending to be lame?

77
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,800
Is this how you treat the person

78
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,040
who saved your life?

79
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,720
So, are you here

80
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,680
just to save me?

81
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,880
How boring.

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,920
You were not like this last night.

83
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,120
You're quite

84
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,880
an incompetent puppet.

85
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,040
What are you doing in my room?

86
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,040
I never expected

87
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,080
that when you were with my brother,

88
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,000
you were so happy every day.

89
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,040
Do you think

90
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,920
we could become like that too?

91
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,640
I already made myself very clear.

92
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,680
Leave.

93
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,080
Are you angry?

94
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,560
Are you thinking about what happened
last night?

95
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,480
I just drank too much last night

96
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,560
and can't remember clearly.

97
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,160
You wouldn't want me to take responsibility.

98
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,760
But you,

99
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,840
scheming to pretend to be lame,

100
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,080
what's your real goal?

101
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,240
I didn't pretend to be lame.

102
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,160
My leg's just healed,

103
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,400
I just haven't told anyone yet.

104
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,880
You expect me to believe that?

105
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,520
No matter your purpose,

106
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,440
don't forget our agreement.

107
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,360
Hanxing?

108
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,560
Did you sleep yet?

109
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,480
I bought your favorite chestnut cake.

110
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,720
Aren't you leaving?

111
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,000
Do you want me to tell your uncle

112
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,360
your leg is healed?

113
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,840
Okay.

114
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:06,800
Then I'll show this

115
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,560
to my uncle.

116
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,840
Hanxing,

117
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,760
are you asleep?

118
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,360
Hanxing?

119
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,760
I'm coming in.

120
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,000
Sihuai,

121
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,280
you are home.

122
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,040
Why are you sleeping

123
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,480
so early today?

124
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,160
I'm so tired.

125
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,760
Alright,

126
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,080
then sleep well.

127
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,280
I bought you a cake.

128
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,480
Eat it tomorrow morning.

129
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,720
Mm.

130
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,560
Okay.

131
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,760
Get up!

132
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,400
Looks like you have already picked a side.

133
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,320
Get off!

134
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,080
I came to remind you not to

135
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,480
make unnecessary moves.

136
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,880
If my uncle finds out,

137
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,160
all your carefully prepared wedding plans

138
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,880
will be wasted.

139
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,600
Good night.

140
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,520
He Chen,

141
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,040
I will find you, no matter what.

142
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,600
- Ms. Zhang.
- Madam.

143
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,720
Zhaozhao is back?

144
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,120
Yes, his illness is almost gone.

145
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,720
I just brought him back from the pet hospital.

146
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,160
Oh, where is he now?

147
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll go feed him.

148
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,360
He's playing outside with Mr. He.

149
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,440
