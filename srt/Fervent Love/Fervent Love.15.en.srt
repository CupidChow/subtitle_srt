6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,180
(Morning Glory)

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,880
You're moving out?

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,880
Do you remember that day

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,960
when we went to the art gallery
to pick out paintings?

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,200
I liked number 9,

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,640
you liked number 13.

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,520
Although we had differences,

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,480
I later found out

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,840
you chose the painting I liked, number 9.

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,720
So, I placed your favorite number 13 here.

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,080
Why are you moving out?

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,400
I've fulfilled my promise to you.

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,440
Now, it's your turn to keep your promise.

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,120
Tell me,

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,560
where is He Chen?

21
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,800
I don't know.

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,640
Then, I have nothing more to gain from you.

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,720
The art gallery is finished,

24
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,240
and Mr. Kang's project is over.

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,360
I won't return to Heshi Group.

26
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,920
We

27
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,320
should never meet again.

28
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,040
You still haven't told me
why you're moving out.

29
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,600
Because

30
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,440
I can't continue like this.

31
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,000
Hanxing,

32
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,240
why are you here?

33
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,480
Xinglan is going to be sold to Heshi as part
of Shen Weixi's dowry?

34
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,720
Yes.

35
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,240
Even if Cheng Qiuyu wants to sell it,

36
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,320
how could you agree to acquiring Xinglan?

37
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,640
You know how important Xinglan is to me.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,240
You decided to marry me

39
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,240
to solve the problem with Xinglan, right?

40
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,960
Now I'm helping you.

41
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,400
We get married,

42
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,280
you'll be Mrs. Zhong,

43
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,280
and you won't need to work so hard anymore.

44
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,960
Once Heshi Group acquires Xinglan,

45
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,200
I'll hire professionals to manage it.

46
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,400
If you still care about it,

47
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,840
you can oversee it anytime.

48
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,120
None of this will change.

49
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,760
You've put too much into Xinglan,

50
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,720
but after marriage,
I don't want you to be so tired.

51
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,160
You can sleep in every day,

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,560
do whatever you want.

53
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,880
If we have children in the future,

54
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,160
you can spend time with them.

55
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,760
Isn't that good?

56
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,360
Stop Heshi Group from acquiring Xinglan?

57
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,600
Yes.

58
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,480
Xinglan is my mother's life's work,

59
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,320
I can't let it be sold.

60
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,720
Jingyao,

61
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,240
you're the one I trust the most.

62
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,560
Could you

63
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,680
please help me?

64
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,760
But Heshi is a major client of our law firm,

65
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,320
and I'll be in charge of the contract
for the acquisition.

66
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,400
I know it's hard for you,

67
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,960
but I'm really out of options.

68
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,040
You don't have to help me directly,

69
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,760
just give me some advice.

70
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,600
Okay?

71
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,800
The quickest way right now is to persuade
your father,

72
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,720
because

73
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,280
if all of Xinglan's shareholders agree

74
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,640
to sell their shares to Heshi Group,

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,760
the acquisition will be successful.

76
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,240
But...

77
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,360
But Dad, you're

78
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,200
the largest shareholder of Xinglan.

79
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,600
As long as you stand up
on the day of the acquisition

80
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,200
and show that you don't agree
to sell the shares...

81
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,080
There will be a turning point.

82
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,880
Why let Shen Minghai do it on the day
of the acquisition?

83
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,440
If he does it in advance,

84
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,160
are you sure your stepmother won't whisper
in his ear?

85
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,080
But Shen Minghai and Cheng Qiuy
are in cahoots.

86
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,120
I'm not sure he will choose me.

87
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,680
Persuasion is about

88
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,840
playing the cards of interest
and emotion together.

89
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,040
It's not difficult.

90
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,400
For example...

91
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,760
Dad,

92
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,360
I know you want to
use this money for retirement,

93
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,960
but I hope you'll consider

94
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,360
whether you want to use this money

95
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,920
for yourself, Shen Weixi and Cheng Qiuyu,

96
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,080
or keep Xinglan and hand it over to me,

97
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,160
making your shares even more valuable.

98
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,480
Which option gives you more security?

99
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,640
Also, I want to tell you

100
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,360
that I have always been your daughter.

101
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,880
I just want you to live better.

102
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,720
You still haven't told me
why you're moving out.

103
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
Because

104
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,880
I can't continue like this.

105
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,120
(Hanxing, I'm sorry.)

106
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,640
(I made you fall in love)

107
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,480
(both with me and with the He Can I play.)

108
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,360
(How guilty and sad should you feel?)

109
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,240
(I wish I could tell you everything,)

110
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,280
(but I can't do that.)

111
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,320
He Can,

112
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,160
if you want to drink,

113
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,080
you can come find me.

114
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,200
Get ready for your wedding with Shen Weixi.

115
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,080
I'm not ready yet, Uncle.

116
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,040
The Shen family proposed

117
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,040
to use Xinglan as part of Shen Weixi's dowry.

118
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,680
Heshi Group will acquire it.

119
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,600
This concerns the interests of the group,

120
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,600
and you

121
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,120
have no right to disagree.

122
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,680
Alright.

123
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,200
(Heshi Group)
The documents here

124
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,960
are the full terms of this agreement.

125
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,920
Since everyone has reached a consensus,

126
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,200
you may sign now.

127
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,200
What do you mean by a consensus?

128
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,680
Did I agree to this?

129
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,280
Every term favors Heshi Group!

130
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,760
Shut up.

131
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,320
I am Xinglan's representative.

132
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,760
We've already reviewed the terms,

133
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,600
there's no problem.

134
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,360
Where is the largest shareholder,

135
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,200
Shen Minghai?

136
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,800
We've already confirmed the information.

137
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,640
Shen Minghai is my father.

138
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,320
I asked him before coming here.

139
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,920
He also disagrees with this acquisition.

140
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,440
You can forget about signing this contract.

141
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,920
He should be on his way here by now.

142
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,000
What a joke.

143
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,040
He entrusted me to handle this matter.

144
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,200
He doesn't even want to see you,

145
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,200
and you expect him to show up today?

146
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,150
This is a big deal.

147
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,010
I think we should

148
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,320
wait for the key decision-maker to arrive

149
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,840
to avoid any future disputes

150
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,120
after the contract is signed.

151
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,240
But we can't keep dragging this out.

152
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,280
Let's wait another half hour.

153
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,960
If he hasn't arrived by then,

154
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,280
we'll renegotiate

155
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,320
the contract.

156
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,840
Why renegotiate?

157
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,360
It's clearly written here.

158
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,960
And I have Shen Minghai's power of attorney.

159
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,840
We'll sign the contract today.

160
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,920
Qiuyu.

161
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,080
Minghai, what are you doing here?

162
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,120
Dad.

163
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,080
I'm Shen Minghai.

164
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,280
I'm...

165
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,360
I'm here to sign.

166
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,240
I agree to the contract.

167
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,200
Then, let's sign the contract.
