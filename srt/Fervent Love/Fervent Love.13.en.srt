I'm about to get married.

Bless me.

8
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,200
He Chen,

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,160
happy birthday.

(Shen Hanxing,)

(he is He Chen's younger brother.)

12
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,480
Whose birthday is it?

13
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,760
Why are you crying?

14
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,120
Is it because of He Chen?

15
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
Tell me!

16
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,960
You can't forget him, right?

17
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,360
Am I right?

18
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,080
Hanxing, I'm sorry, I...

19
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,440
Wear the necklace I gave you, okay?

20
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,720
Okay?

21
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,480
Okay?

22
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,440
Okay.

23
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,360
It looks so nice.

24
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,880
Have some rest.

25
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,760
Honey,

26
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,160
eat some fruit.

27
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,880
Why so cold?

28
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,400
I'm your fiancée.

29
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,920
I never said I was going to marry you.

30
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,280
Uncle already agreed.

31
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,040
Then you can marry him.

32
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,720
What are you listening to?

33
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,600
You can have it.

34
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,600
I just dumped you once,

35
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,600
what's the big deal?

36
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,360
Does it still hurt?

37
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,760
It really looks good.

38
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,000
It suits you well.

39
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,040
Sorry.

40
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,160
Hanxing.

41
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,140
(He Chen
Husband of Shen Hanxing)

42
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,640
What are you doing?

43
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,680
Hanxing,

44
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,760
what are you doing?

45
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,850
Zhong Sihuai,

46
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,960
pay for what you did!

47
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,120
Even if we have to

48
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,040
kill someone,

49
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,120
it should be done by me.

50
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,280
This is my business.

51
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,680
Why are you interfering?

52
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,480
Because I love you.

53
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,040
My love

54
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,600
is worth more than your hatred.

55
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,720
He Can, know your place.

56
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,120
We're family.

57
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,080
Family?

58
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,640
But Aunt Hanxing

59
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,640
I don't want to be your family.

60
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,280
You're crazy!

61
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,640
You became crazy first,

62
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,560
so I'll go crazy with you!

63
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,580
(He Chen
Husband of Shen Hanxing)

64
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,180
(He Chen)

65
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,120
Zhong Sihuai,

66
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,040
what do you mean by this?

67
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,320
Ten percent of the shares? That's robbery!

68
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,080
I could be asking for more.

69
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,800
Once these photos are made public,

70
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,480
your thirty years of reputation

71
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,720
may be ruined.

72
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,520
I never did this.

73
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,200
Whether you did it or not is one thing,

74
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,520
but whether others believe it is another.

75
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,800
Uncle Bai, it's only 10%.

76
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,120
You will still have a seat

77
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,920
on the BOD of Heshi Group.

78
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,880
Chairman He is still in a coma.

79
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,840
And you are already so eager to step out

80
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,240
and fight with He Chen for the position?

81
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,840
Does he know about this?

82
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,880
Uncle Bai,

83
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,200
you'd better understand the situation.

84
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,240
He Chen has already

85
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,480
signed the contract, transferring

86
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,240
your business line in Jiangbei

87
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,000
to my hands.

88
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,800
What?

89
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,040
What's He Chen doing?

90
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,640
He Chen has seen

91
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,400
all the little moves you've made in the company

92
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,880
over the years.

93
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,760
Even if I and He Chen fight in the future,

94
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,040
for now,

95
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,480
he and I are

96
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,160
family.

97
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,000
(Art Gallery Curating)
Based on the proposal,

98
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,880
I've selected a batch of paintings
around the theme.

99
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,600
These paintings emphasize light and shadow.

100
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,880
Under natural light,

101
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,200
they will show different visual effects

102
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,520
depending on the time and angle.

103
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,800
I think

104
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,800
this can be a point for publicity when we
open the gallery.

105
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,200
It can encourage people

106
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,480
to visit multiple times

107
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,560
or to stay longer each time they visit.

108
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,640
Anything else to add?

109
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,160
Mr. He?

110
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,560
You're injured?

111
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,880
No.

112
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,680
