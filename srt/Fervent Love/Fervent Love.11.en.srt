Why is it raining?

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,640
It's fine, Mr. Kang,

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,000
let's go inside and keep drinking.

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,040
I can see you are so happy today,

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,080
I'll make sure you have enough fun.

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,400
Let me tell you,

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,880
today,

13
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:42,960
you'll all have to

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,960
get drunk

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,040
and stay here.

16
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,880
I'll make arrangements.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,840
Alright, alright.

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,480
Come on.

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,310
He Can, come.

20
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,540
(Egret Restaurant)

21
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,560
Good morning.

22
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,640
Good morning.

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,000
You performed well last night.

24
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,000
You taught me well.

25
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,520
Thank you.

26
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,400
So can you tell me where He Chen is?

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,280
The resort project is only halfway done,

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,120
it's not finished yet,

29
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,080
why the rush?

30
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,880
Well then,

31
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,160
help me out, my ally.

32
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,720
What do you need?

33
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,360
This Dr. Huang

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,280
was the attending doctor for you
after the car accident.

35
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,520
I've noticed something strange about him.

36
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,080
After you and He Chen had the accident,

37
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,040
he mysteriously resigned. Then he suddenly

38
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,360
(Investigation Report: Huang Ren)
disappeared.

39
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,800
I've recently received news that he's back
in the country.

40
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,960
I want you to help me

41
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,120
find him.

42
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,720
I suspect he knows something.

43
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,080
Send it to me, I'll try.

44
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,960
Hmm.

45
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,640
Thanks.

46
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,320
Hanxing.

47
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,650
- Good morning.
- Morning.

48
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,720
Good morning, Uncle.

49
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,640
He Can,

50
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,880
I've been meaning to ask you something.

51
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,920
What is it, Uncle?

52
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,200
Have you ever wanted

53
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,880
to become the real He Chen?

54
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,760
My dream has always been violin and Vienna,

55
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,240
you know that, Uncle.

56
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,200
Sometimes, I just want to be myself,

57
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,280
not anyone else.

58
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,840
To remember who you are,

59
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,000
that's great.

60
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,600
You go ahead.

61
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,080
- Hello.
- Mr. Zhong.

62
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,000
How have you been?

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,840
It's me.

64
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,040
Huang Ren from St. Cross Hospital
in Los Angeles.

65
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,880
You promised me if I came back,

66
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,320
you'd give me money.

67
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,440
Why aren't you keeping your word?

68
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,760
You wanna deny it?

69
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,400
Then let me give you a little surprise.

70
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,200
The moment he is gone,

71
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,080
the will takes effect.

72
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,600
And you know,

73
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,120
the will clearly states everything is left
to He Chen.

74
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,600
(The school has been exposed.)

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,640
(Zhong Sihuai must be prepared.)

76
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,080
(For now,)

77
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,560
(finding the doctor might be easier.)

78
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,920
(Why am I thinking of him?)

79
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,240
(Where is the necklace?)

80
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,840
I'll help you put it on.

81
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,640

95
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,560
has become the heir to the Heshi Group.

96
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,840

Uncle,

101
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,000
you came at the right time.

102
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,640
Help me settle this,

103
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,000
we were in a good relationship in the U.S.,

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,360
now that I'm here to reconcile,

105
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,520
he turned his back on me.

106
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,720
Let's go talk in my place.

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,040
The accident was arranged by me.

108
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,360
Now, the old man could...

109
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,240
Once he leaves...

110
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,160
Where did you

111
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,840
get this video?

112
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,680
How about your boyfriend?

113
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,200
How about your boyfriend?

114
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,720
Correction:

115
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,160
ex-boyfriend, okay?

116
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,720
Why?

117
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,520
Didn't you tell me he was born in a
super wealthy family?

118
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,080
Just drop it.

119
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,680
I found him as poor as a church mouse.

120
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,560
Okay, fine.

121
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,920
It's a gift from God.

122
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,920
Speak up,

123
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,680
what do you want?

124
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,480
I've said it,

125
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,440
I just want to get back with He Can

126
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,800
and marry him.

127
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,640
Alright, I can help you with that.

128
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,960
Wow,

129
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,040
that is easier than I thought.

130
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,440
But,

131
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,840
are you sure you want to marry him
just like that?

132
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,600
Shouldn't you develop feelings first?

133
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,760
Hmm,

134
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,960
you're right, Uncle.

135
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,080
So, what about this video?

136
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,440
As long as I marry He Can,

137
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,200
I'll destroy the video.

138
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,520
Before that,

139
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,920
I won't show it to anyone else,

140
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,160
including He Can.

141
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,160
Don't worry,

142
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,280
my lifelong happiness depends on you.

143
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,720
