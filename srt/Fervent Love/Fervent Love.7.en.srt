6
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,240
(Zhaozhao used to be an abused stray cat.)

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,320
(Except for He Chen, it never lets anyone else
hold it)

8
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,680
(He Chen.)

9
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,840
(He Can.)

10
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,520
How's King?

11
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,480
He's fine.

12
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,600
He's been playing with me.

13
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,400
How do you know he's called "King"?

14
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,360
That was the name

15
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,120
He Chen gave him before.

16
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,920
After He Chen and I adopted it,

17
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,480
I changed its name

18
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,600
to Zhaozhao.

19
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,880
You...

20
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,040
Who exactly are you?

21
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,560
It's written clearly here.

22
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,260
(King, happy 1st birthday.)
I'm not blind.

23
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,760
You call me He Can one minute,

24
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,000
and He Chen the next.

25
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,080
Are you paranoid or something?

26
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,360
You're too much.

27
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,800
(Sorry, Hanxing.)

28
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,000
Get lost.

29
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,760
Bother me again and I'll teach you a lesson.

30
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,300
(Santa Barbara, America)

31
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,560
Can.

32
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,200
Why did you come all the way here?

33
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,160
Grandfather is ill.

34
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,600
Come back with me.

35
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,760
That's your grandfather,

36
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,640
not mine.

37
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,920
What?

38
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,680
Can't lift the coffin by yourself?

39
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,200
My leg is lame.

40
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,160
I can't help you.

41
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,280
We're family.

42
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,120
Family?

43
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,480
When my mom remarried,

44
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,920
you all abandoned us.

45
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,240
Where were you when she died?

46
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,240
Where were you when Charles forced me
to learn the piano

47
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
to earn performance fees?

48
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,880
Huh?

49
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,280
I didn't know you were living this hard.

50
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,480
They all said you...

51
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,320
What did they say?

52
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,920
They said every time I called, it was
to ask for money?

53
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,680
That was all Charles forcing me to call.

54
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,280
You talk about family,

55
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,320
but if you had thought of me earlier,

56
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,320
my leg wouldn't be like this now.

57
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,560
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,960
Sorry doesn't solve anything, does it?

59
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,200
Ahoge,

60
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,840
give me one more chance, okay?

61
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,680
When we were kids,

62
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,400
I promised I'd protect you.

63
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,000
This time, I won't go back on my word.

64
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,800
Ahoge,

65
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,600
come home with me.

66
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,320
You look better with new clothes.

67
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,960
I feel uncomfortable in this suit.

68
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,600
By the way,

69
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,880
take this.

70
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,200
Dad left it for you.

71
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,520
He said it could bring you good luck.

72
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,720
I was afraid of losing it,

73
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,000
so I always wore it on my hand.

74
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,720
When we get back,

75
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,600
I plan to explain your situation
to the family.

76
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960
If you don't mind,

77
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,040
stay at the company and help me out.

78
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,360
No wonder they keep coming to me lately.

79
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,520
Who else came to you?

80
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,240
Uncle,

81
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,880
Zhong Sihuai.

82
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,240
It's too late.

83
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,920
Move and hide him.

84
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,880
Keep the domestic address a secret.

85
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,000
Remember, the person who was severely injured
is He Can,

86
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,000
and the person with minor injuries is He Chen.

87
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:03,100
(Name: He Can)

88
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,080
He Can,

89
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,280
you're awake.

90
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,520
I've informed Shen Hanxing about
the car accident.

91
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,640
You tell her face to face tomorrow.

92
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,600
Okay.

93
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,640
Uncle,

94
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,960
where is my brother?

95
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,240
That's something you don't need to know.

96
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,960
Just remember, your leg

97
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,680
was severely injured in the car accident.

98
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,200
From now on,

99
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,240
you're no longer He Can,

100
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,440
but your brother,

101
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,880
He Chen.

102
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,440
I'll do as you say.

103
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,880
(I'll fix everything as soon as possible.)

104
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,840
(Give me a little more time,)

105
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,040
(Hanxing.)

106
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,080
