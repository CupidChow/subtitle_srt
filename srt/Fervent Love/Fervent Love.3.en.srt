Who did you offend this time?

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,360
There's not much money left
in the Xinglan account, and now

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,640
it's being attacked by short sellers.

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,840
When my mom was around,

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,520
Xinglan was one of the top art investment
companies in the country.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,840
Xinglan was always a mess.

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,920
Can you blame me for that?

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,880
What are you shouting about?

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,880
Why are you fighting again?

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,160
Minghai,

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,080
look at Hanxing.

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,640
I've been married to you for so many years,

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,240
and she still refuses to call me "Mom".

19
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,640
And every time she comes, she yells at me.

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,720
Hanxing, I know you're anxious,

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,360
but you can't blame her entirely

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,880
for what happened to Xinglan.

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,720
Dad,

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,720
are you just going to let her ruin Xinglan?

25
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:03,880
You ungrateful wretch!

26
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,200
Stop trying to stir up trouble.

27
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,520
I agreed to your dad sending you abroad,

28
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,360
what else do you want?

29
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,760
You sent me abroad

30
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,560
without giving me a single cent, and still

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,680
have the nerve to say that?

32
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,960
If it weren't for me sending you abroad,

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,160
would you have met He Chen?

34
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,070
Hmph.

35
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,800
You were just too useless to keep him,

36
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,480
otherwise, this little issue with Xinglan

37
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,480
could be easily solved by Heshi Group.

38
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,960
Oh, enough! Enough!

39
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,120
The most important thing right now

40
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,920
is to solve Xinglan's funding shortage.

41
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,480
Hanxing,

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,320
you've already been engaged.

43
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,880
You are part of the He family now.

44
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,640
As the future Mrs. Zhong,

45
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,600
just

46
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,200
ask them for help.

47
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,320
Dad,

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,520
I'm neither part of He family

49
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,960
nor Mrs. Zhong.

50
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,160
I'm Shen Hanxing.

51
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,480
I'll solve this crisis for Xinglan

52
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,160
in the name of Shen Hanxing.

53
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,440
Mr. Kang's resort is really nice.

54
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,880
Did you look at the information I gave you?

55
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,640
Don't worry, Uncle,

56
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,480
I've memorized it all.

57
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,440
This resort project

58
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,360
is Heshi Group's biggest cooperation this year.

59
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,880
They've been delaying the signing process
for the contract.

60
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,840
You're his long-time friend.

61
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,760
I understand. I'll convince him

62
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,800
and get this project.

63
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,280
Did you find out?

64
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,160
Who did this?

65
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,240
The institution shorting Xinglan
has ties to Heshi Group.

66
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,760
He Can.

67
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,400
He Chen,

68
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,520
I heard about

69
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,400
your accident abroad recently.

70
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,480
I didn't expect it to be so serious.

71
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,800
I'm much better now.

72
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,000
Thanks for your concern, Mr. Kang.

73
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,120
Mr. Kang,

74
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,560
about this project...

75
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,640
We haven't seen each other for long,

76
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,040
and I've just received two bottles
of good wine.

77
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,160
He Chen,

78
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,440
let's put away

79
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,480
those troubles.

80
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,920
Come on, blind taste it.

81
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,720
This is your strong suit.

82
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,720
These two bottles

83
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,560
are both sweet white.

84
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,120
Try to tell which one is late harvest

85
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,360
and which one is noble rot.

86
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,080
Mr. Kang,

87
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,680
He Chen caught a cold days ago,

88
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,520
so his taste isn't good.

89
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,080
He might disappoint you.

90
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,800
Oh, why didn't you say so earlier?

91
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,080
Don't drink when you are sick.

92
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,920
- Give it to me.
- Ah.

93
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,000
Let's

94
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,920
have some tea.

95
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,720
Have some tea.

96
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,080
Today, we'll just catch up.

97
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,320
This accident was really sudden.

98
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,960
My uncle took care of

99
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,160
both the family and the company.

100
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,440
You can always trust your family.

101
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,800
Go get that contract on my table.

102
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,360
Mr. Kang, may we have

103
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,520
a nice cooperation.

104
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,200
He Chen knows about wine?

105
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,840
He Chen is very good at wine tasting,

106
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,640
but his alcohol tolerance isn't great.

107
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,280
Got it.

108
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,280
I'll be on a business trip next week.

109
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,400
You be careful,

110
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,280
don't make any mistakes.

111
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,840
Okay.

112
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,400
Once we get the No. 6 item,

113
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,600
Xinglan will be saved.

114
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,800
No. 6?

115
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,600
You mean The Sea Under the Mist?

116
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,760
I checked,

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,640
this Polish artist's works are average,

118
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,680
and he's not considered a promising
emerging artist.

119
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,520
What's valuable is not his painting,

120
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,040
but the materials used.

121
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,580
Some of the materials for this painting

122
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,080
come from the Polish local brand Anya.

123
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,800
This brand isn't great for making pigments,

124
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,880
sometimes they even add blue crystal minerals.

125
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,120
A few days ago, it was recognized worldwide
as a rare mineral.

126
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,080
And for this The Sea Under the Mist,

127
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,600

Don't you want to know where He Chen is?

166

You must know Mr. Kang from Huanyu Group,
right?

He only cooperates with He Chen.

168

I can't let any flaws show.

169
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,680
If I help you become He Chen,

170
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,120
