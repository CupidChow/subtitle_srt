Sihuai,

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,560
you said you'd wait until I was ready.

Aren't you worried

29
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,120
she might find out that the contract
has issues?

30
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,040
If you're not at ease,

31
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,360
go and test the waters yourself.

32
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,320
Okay.

I'm not sure if you'll like it.

35
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,280
As long as it's made by you,

36
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,400
I'll like it.

Nothing.

You go ahead and eat.

00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,320
I'll go back to work.

Number 13?

49
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,640
Number 13 won't work.

50
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,520
Number 9 is more suitable.

51
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,960
Besides, Sihuai mentioned

52
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,220
that he prefers that one.

53
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,240
And I believe that He Chen might...

54
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,320
Shen Hanxing,

55
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,360
I don't understand what you're doing.

56
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,080
Are you looking for your beloved He Chen,

57
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,680
or have you fallen for my uncle?

58
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,920
Or

59
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,200
are you trying to find He Chen's shadow in me?

60
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,680
You have no trace of him in you.

61
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,800
You're far from him.

62
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,200
You can't even handle such a small thing!

63
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,320
What a waste of time!

64
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,760
Sorry.

65
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,600
I still remember when we were in middle school,

66
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,280
you said your dream was to be the owner
of a coffee shop.

67
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,960
You wanted to get up every afternoon
and start working.

68
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,000
Dreams are things we have when we're young.

69
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,200
But when you grow up...

70
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,040
Growing up is great.

71
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,840
Now, you're a top lawyer who can work
with Heshi Group.

72
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,560
So many people are envious of you.

73
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,200
What's so great about that?

74
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,440
I envy you.

75
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,000
You're about to become

76
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,000
Mrs. Zhong and start enjoying life.

77
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,480
Oh, by the way,

78
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,400
I heard from Heshi Group's employees recently

79
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,840
that you were with Mr. He for quite a long time

80
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,920
and have been working together

81
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,080
on the same project.

82
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,440
He Chen and I

83
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,000
are just work colleagues.

84
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,920
Sihuai knows about this too.

85
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,880
Oh, woman,

86
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,200
don't be so moralistic.

87
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,080
I'm just asking,

88
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,240
a lot of employees said

89
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,640
they feel

90
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,760
Mr. He is different than before.

91
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,120
No.

92
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,520
Who was scolding you earlier?

93
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,840
Did you have any issues with your work?

94
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,880
Let's not talk about that.

95
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,920
Let's drink.

96
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,800
Okay.

97
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,120
Tonight, we drink until we drop.

98
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
He Chen,

99
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,000
I miss you so much.

100
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,110
You're drunk.

101
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,480

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,040
I don't believe you don't love me anymore.
