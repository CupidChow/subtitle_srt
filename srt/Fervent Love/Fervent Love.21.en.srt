00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,880
What?

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,600
I know he's He Can.

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,040
The day of the car accident,

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,160
Zhong Sihuai switched their identities,

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,880
making He Can play the role of He Chen.

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,000
I've known it all along.

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,000
And I also know about

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,320
your deal with him.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,040
So what?

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,400
By telling me your trump card,

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,840
are you not afraid I'll tell Zhong Sihuai

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,480
that you knew his true color all along?

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,760
He might not love you anymore.

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,120
You won't.

20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,520
Because Zhong Sihuai can't help you,

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,720
but I can.

22
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,080
Yes,

23
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,960
Zhong Sihuai promised

24
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,080
to help you marry He Can,

25
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,920
but

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,560
what he wants is Heshi,

27
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,400
he won't let He Can rise to the top.

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,840
So what good is it for you to marry He Can?

29
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,440
He's still the same,

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,480
the poor guy you despise.

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,750
Unless you've

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,640
fallen in love with him.

33
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,800
I'm a straightforward person.

34
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,840
If you want money,

35
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,680
I can give it to you.

36
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,360
Now that I'm managing Xinglan,

37
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,400
I can guarantee you'll have a good life.

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,000
All you need to do

39
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,000
is tell me his secrets.

40
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,880
(So that car accident wasn't an accident.)

41
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,800
I can't give it to you right now.

42
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,440
How do you plan

43
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,640
to deal with Zhong Sihuai?

44
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,120
At the shareholder meeting,

45
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,960
I've already planned it.

46
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,280
Alright,

47
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,960
then I'll uncover this

48
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,960
at that time,

49
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,840
but I can't give it to you now.

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,720
You might throw me under the bus.

51
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,950
When the time comes,

52
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,400
you take what you want,

53
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,920
and I'll take what I want.

54
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,400
Don't go back on your word.

55
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,800
Okay.

56
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,880
I need to go to Melbourne.

57
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,800
Why?

58
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,760
To meet with Mr. Liu, a shareholder of Heshi.

59
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,520
Mr. Liu?

60
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,440
Though his shares are on par
with Bai Jiangbo's,

61
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,920
he's an old friend of He Zhao.

62
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,560
We didn't approach him before

63
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,120
because we thought it was hopeless.

64
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,120
But he contacted me yesterday, saying he's

65
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,640
interested in cooperating with you.

66
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,080
If we get him,

67
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,880
your shares will surpass He Chen's.

68
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,200
No matter what,

69
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,200
since he reached out,

70
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,480
I'll definitely make an effort to try.

71
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll be back

72
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,840
in at most ten days.

73
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,680
Don't act rashly.

74
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,040
Okay, be safe.

75
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,800
(Guard)
Don't worry,

76
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,520
I'm keeping an eye on him.

77
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,290
Everything will be fine.

78
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,320
The PR department told me they've arranged

79
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,920
an interview for you in two days.

80
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,320
Just be careful what you say,

81
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,680
don't mess it up.

82
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,720
Okay.

83
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,880
Don't worry, Uncle,

84
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,120
I'll prepare well for the interview.

85
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,860
(Conversation with Hanxing)

86
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,440
Hello?

87
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,560
Mr. Zhong,

88
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,280
this is the Manya Wedding Dress Store.

89
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,960
Your wife has an appointment tomorrow at 7 pm,

90
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,760
but we haven't been able to reach her.

91
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,520
Would you like us to prepare a few suits
for the groom,

92
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,200
so we can match them for you tomorrow?

93
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,400
Oh,

94
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,880
my wife, Shen Hanxing,

95
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,360
is trying on wedding dresses tomorrow?

96
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,680
No problem,

97
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,520
prepare a few suits for the groom,

98
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,360
I'll go with my wife

99
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,560
to check them out.

100
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,680
That'll be good.

101
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,360
Tomorrow I'll go with Hanxing to try on
wedding dresses.

102
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,680
Prepare for the interview.

103
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,480
- Hello.
- Hello.

104
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,200
Mr. Zhong, the 7 o'clock appointment.

105
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,040
Seven o'clock.

106
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,200
Mr. Zhong and Miss Shen

107
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,400
just went in.

108
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,480
What are you doing?

109
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,800
Have you forgotten whose woman she is?

110
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,160
She's not married to anyone,

111
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,480
she's not anyone's aunt

112
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,480
or wife,

113
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,080
she's just Shen Hanxing,

114
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,080
the one

115
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,120
I love.

116
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,560
Go ahead, hit me.

117
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,400
He left you so easily,

118
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,560
don't you remember?

119
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,360
Do you know who he is?

120
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,680
I don't care who he is,

121
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,280
he is the man I love.

122
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,280
Since that day when I made him see

123
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,520
the messages we exchanged,

124
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,400
we've been planning this day.

125
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,080
The road ahead will get harder.

126
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,160
Are you afraid?

127
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,600
Isn't this the result we wanted?

128
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,960
He should be coming soon.

129
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,400
In his eyes,

130
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,680
I've fallen for my ex's younger brother.

131
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,160
And I've fallen for my brother's ex-girlfriend.

132
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,800
With his personality,

133
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,160
he'll definitely go crazy.

134
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,760
He must be eager to discard He Can as a pawn,

135
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,800
so he must be

136
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,240
very anxious to call

137
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,080
the shareholder meeting.

138
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,040
He should be unable to wait for

139
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,280
Liu Jingyao to come back.

140
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,840
He Can is already back with us.

141
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,160
Shen Weixi

142
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,320
has agreed to expose Zhong Sihuai's doing

143
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,840
at the shareholder meeting.

144
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,080
Even so,

145
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,960
there's still no 100% guarantee,

146
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,360
because Zhong Sihuai has more shares

147
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,200
than you.

148
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,720
Don't worry,

149
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,120
I've asked Grandpa's friend,

150
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,960
Mr. Liu, to help.

151
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,160
He promised to temporarily transfer
the shares to me

152
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,600
to help me through this.

153
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,320
Mr. Zhong, the hospital said

154
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,680
that Mr. He has suddenly improved,

155
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,680
and he might wake up soon.

156
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,400
It's such an important matter,

157
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,600
why didn't you

158
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,640
tell me

159
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,720
earlier?

160
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,000
