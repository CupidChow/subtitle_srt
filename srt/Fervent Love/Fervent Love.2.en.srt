6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,200
Try it!

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,760
Why should I listen to a mad dog?

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,120
What did you say?

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,960
What did you just say to me?

10
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,640
Look at me!

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,080
Get your hands off me!

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,720
He Can, tell them to let go of me!

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,600
What are you doing?

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,440
This is the He family,

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,560
not a place where you can run wild.

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,640
Your stepson, He Can, is in the hospital
receiving post-surgery treatment.

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,680
If you want to see him,

18
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,200
wait until he wakes up.

19
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,440
You can't do this to me!

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,640
He Can! He Can!

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,680
Sorry, everyone.

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,640
I'll handle this.

23
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,040
Please continue.

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,120
You lied to me!

25
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,800
Mr. Charles,

26
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,960
he really is He Can.

27
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,000
There's no violin mark on him.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,520
But he didn't try to unlock the phone.

29
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,480
Where are you now?

30
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,120
It's all your fault.

31
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,040
It looks like you are really behind

32
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,080
what happened tonight.

33
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,760
Yes.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,840
So what?

35
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,480
How come I never knew

36
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,160
you dance so well?

37
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,520
There are a lot of things

38
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,840
you don't know

39
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,720
about me.

40
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,080
Has Uncle seen you like this?

41
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,960
What?

42
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,200
Jealous?

43
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,920
If he knew you were so distracted

44
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,240
while holding him just now,

45
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,480
do you think he'd go crazy?

46
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,600
Sihuai is very gentle,

47
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,800
the one going crazy

48
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,720
seems to be someone else.

49
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,320
When did you find out

50
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,840
someone was going to test your identity?

51
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,640
From the moment you took my hair.

52
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,640
Now it's my turn to ask.

53
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,600
Why did you suspect

54
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,920
I'm not He Chen?

55
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,940
(DNA Identity Test Report)

56
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,260
(DNA match rate is 100%)

57
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,520
So what?

58
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,400
Is there a problem with the DNA match?

59
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,680
Of course, there's a problem.

60
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,800
Because the hair I sent for comparison

61
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,520
was mine.

62
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,400
Your assistant is too stupid.

63
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,400
He just swapped the documents

64
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,920
without knowing anything.

65
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,480
If you hadn't been afraid,

66
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,280
would you have done this?

67
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,880
When did you start suspecting I'm not He Chen?

68
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,680
The moment He Chen told me we were breaking up.

69
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,780
(Santa Barbara, America)

70
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,240
He Chen!

71
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,720
What happened?

72
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,520
Why are you in a wheelchair?

73
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,920
An accident happened,

74
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
and it ended up like this.

75
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,600
It's okay.

76
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,840
Don't worry.

77
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,320
You'll get better.

78
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,560
I'll always be with you.

79
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,520
If you want to go to Paris for treatment,

80
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,520
I'll go with you.

81
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,360
Let's break up.

82
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,280
What?

83
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,600
I don't love you anymore.

84
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,480
I don't believe it.

85
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,520
I don't believe it.

86
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,320
He Chen!

87
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,680
You didn't believe

88
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,000
I'd be so cold to tell you we're breaking up?

89
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,920
You don't want to give up?

90
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,040
No, I don't.

91
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,280
I met Charles at the hospital,

92
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,160
he said you're He Can.

93
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,200
He's mistaken.

94
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,960
Then where's He Chen's red bracelet?

95
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,080
He's never taken it off.

96
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,480
You suspect me

97
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,560
just for an bracelet?

98
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,560
He Can,

99
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,000
where is He Chen?

100
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,360
Right in front of you.

101
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,200
Who says I'm not He Chen?

102
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,880
Charles,

103
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,480
or your baseless DNA report?

104
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,280
Or,

105
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,040
is it the scar from appendectomy

106
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,200
you've been trying to see

107
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,320
in my room?

108
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,920
It's just a scar.

109
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,760
It's easy to fake.

110
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,480
The key is, are you satisfied with the result?

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,080
Do you want it to be there,

112
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,080
or not?

113
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,440
Get lost!

114
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,720
I'll do everything I can

115
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,200
to destroy your disguise.

116
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,440
Hanxing,

117
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,640
I've ordered a custom wedding dress in Paris.

118
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,160
Next week we can fly over and try it on,

119
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,480
then pick a good day

120
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,680
to get married.

121
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,540
Sihuai,

122
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,280
you know Xinglan was left to me by my mother,

123
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,560
it's very important to me.

124
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,120
So I want to wait...

125
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,680
Are you still unable to forget him?

126
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,520
No, I…

127
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,400
It's fine,

128
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,520
I can wait.

129
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,840
It was He Chen who dumped me.

130
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,000
From the moment he did that,

131
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,680
this relationship was over.

132
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,040
Now,

133
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,440
we must look forward,

134
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,280
and continue living.

135
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,280
Okay.

136
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,400
You are right.

137
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,920
First, we'll solve the issue with Xinglan.

138
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,240
Hey,

139
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,560
I want a lot of flowers at the wedding.

140
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,560
Anything you say.

141
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,680
How is He Can now?

142
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,560
Wasn't he in the accident with He Chen?

143
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,600
He's

144
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,800
still unconscious,

145
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,520
recovering abroad.

146
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,400
Oh.

147
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,480
Which hospital?

148
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,560
Should we go visit him?

149
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,120
I haven't met him yet.

150
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,600
He Can's father never liked him
before he fell ill.

151
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,560
Given the current situation, it's not
appropriate for us to visit him.

152
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,840
Let's do it later.

153
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,560
Hey,

154
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,080
what happened with that
troublemaking foreigner?

155
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,480
How did you settle it?

156
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,920
Thank you for taking care of He Can

157
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,880
all these years.

158
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,320
You,

159
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,160
you know I've been taking care of him.

160
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,240
I know exactly how you've taken care of him.

161
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,020
Leave!

162
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,080
I won't leave.

163
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,400
He is my son, He Can.

164
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,840
Please believe me.

165
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,080
You've all been fooled by him.

166
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,240
If one more person knows this secret,

167
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,480
I'll send someone

168
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,120
to take care of you,

169
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,720
just like you've taken care of He Can.

170
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,240
Leave this country!

171
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,240
I gave him some money to send him away.

172
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,920
I see.

173
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,440
(Charles didn't expose He Can,)

174
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,680
(and Zhong Sihuai refuses to disclose
the hospital address.)

175
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,520
(He Chen,)

176
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,080
(how should I find you?)

177
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,720
Are you the relative the we called just now?

178
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,620
Yes, I am.

179
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,000
We need you to identify them
and do the registration.

180
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,680
Who is the right one?

181
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,480
The moment he is gone,

182
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,160
the will takes effect.

183
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,400
You're Heshi Group's lawyer, so you know,

184
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,360
the will clearly states everything is left
to He Chen.

185
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,200
Then what chance do I have?

186
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,040
I have to think of something soon.

187
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,480
You don't need to worry about the rest.

188
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,440
I'll arrange it.

189
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,200
What are you planning?

190
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,400
Let He Chen go back safely.

191
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,200
How is that possible?

192
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,480
He's seriously injured,

193
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,960
won't wake up in a short time.

194
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,160
And I don't understand,

195
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,360
whether he wakes up or not,

196
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,320
whether he goes back or not,

197
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,000
the will will still take effect.

198
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,280
How can that work?

199
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,680
If the real He Chen goes back, of course
it won't work.

200
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,240
What about a fake one?

201
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,200
You mean

202
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,960
He Can?
