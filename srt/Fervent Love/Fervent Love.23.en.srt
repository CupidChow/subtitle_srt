The group's problems are obvious,

so don't keep your thoughts to yourselves.

- Let's vote.

Come on.

10

If you think He Chen should step down,

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,000
raise your hand.

(General Meeting of Shareholders
of Heshi Group)

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,000
Mr. Bai, you...

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,840
Mr. Bai,

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,480
the one with the most complaints is you.

16
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,640
But why are you...

17
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,560
What's wrong with me?

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,760
I'm doing this for the company.

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,760
A young man just made a mistake,

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,200
and we are forcing him to step down?

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,800
How will they ever handle

22
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,840
the responsibility if they don't have
the chance to grow?

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,120
Mr. Bai, look.

24
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,600
This...

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,040
This is...

26
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,360
The photo Zhong Sihuai used to threaten you

27
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,800
is an AI face-swap.

28
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,680
This is the original video.

29
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,040
It can clear your name.

30
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,320
You're helping me,

31
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,280
but what's your motive?

32
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,920
Very simple.

33
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,280
Mr. Bai's shares

34
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,640
have been sold to me.

35
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,880
So, technically,

36
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,960
he no longer has voting rights.

37
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,720
Actually, it doesn't matter anyway,

38
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,120
because the person sitting here

39
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,280
isn't He Chen.

40
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,160
Not He Chen?

41
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,040
What does that mean?

42
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,760
Then who is it?

43
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,200
This powerless CEO

44
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,560
is actually an imposter.

45
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,440
He's He Chen's twin brother,

46
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,160
He Can.

47
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,680
How is this possible?

48
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,520
Actually,

49
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,400
I already know the truth.

50
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,760
Since the day of the car accident,

51
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,960
you've been lying to me,

52
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,960
pretending to be He Chen.

53
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,680
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

54
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,440
but I am He Chen.

55
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,280
Who can prove that?

56
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,000
I can prove it,

57
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,400
because I'm the real He Can.

58
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,600
The accident was arranged by me.

59
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,520
Now, the old man

60
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,480
could...

61
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,760
The moment he is gone,

62
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,040
the will takes effect.

63
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,040
You know,

64
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,680
the will clearly states...

65
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,040
And you and Liu Jingyao

66
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,280
are just two lunatics,

67
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,120
criminals.

68
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,240
Here's the video evidence of your crime.

69
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,440
You want the shares?

70
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,640
You want to drag me down?

71
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,640
Dream on.

72
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,200
I'm not like you,

73
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,000
you'll go to prison.

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You asked me to help me become CEO,

75
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,960
but you didn't say you've done these things.

76
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,880
Are you crazy?

77
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes,

78
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,560
I did it. The murder,

79
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,720
the car accident, all of it was me.

80
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,560
What now?

81
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
I did it all by myself.

82
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,440
He knew nothing,

83
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,720
he was forced by me.

84
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,080
It's all your fault,

85
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,520
it's all your He family's fault.

86
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,200
You not only ruined our father's life,

87
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,960
but now you want to ruin our future too.

88
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,320
Don't blame your greed

89
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,040
on others.

90
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,800
President He, you're awake.

91
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,480
Grandpa woke up two days ago.

92
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,000
We didn't tell anyone

93
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,760
because someone might have ill intentions.

94
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,240
Lawyer Liu,

95
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,360
I should've figured it out

96
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,760
that you're

97
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,440
the girl from years ago,

98
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,640
Zhong Jingyao.

99
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,640
Your have your father's eyes.

100
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
Shut up.

101
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,520
You have no right to mention my father's name!

102
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,520
It's my fault,

103
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,840
it's all my fault.

104
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,360
I hope for him

105
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,800
to always be the perfect father

106
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,800
in your hearts.

107
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,800
This is the letter your father gave me.

108
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,960
Mr. He,

109
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,040
I was blinded by greed.

110
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,080
I just wanted my kids

111
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,960
to live better lives.

112
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,200
Now it's all over.

113
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,480
How could this be?

114
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,720
I don't believe it.

115
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,000
I don't believe it. Sis,

116
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,640
do you believe it?

117
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,880
Liu Jingyao, Zhong Sihuai,

118
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,280
you're suspected of kidnapping, intimidation,

119
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,000
unfair competition, and other
criminal activities.

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,040
Please come with us.

121
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,480
Zhong Sihuai.

122
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,440
The He family has never wronged you.

123
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,120
Never.

124
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
I'm here.

125
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,960
He Can has already gone to Vienna.

126
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,000
Why do you come here every day?

127
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,680
I'm not here for him.

128
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,080
Then who are you here for?

129
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,880
I'm here for you.

130
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,520
Then why did you block me last time?

131
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,440
But I still came to help you.

132
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,680
Do you have to bring it up every week?

133
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,920
Then,

134
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,280
why did you

135
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,960
come help me last time?

136
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,160
Why do you care?

137
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,600
By the way,

138
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,560
I need money, give me some quickly.

139
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,000
You promised me a worry-free life,

140
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,280
you can't go back on your word,

141
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,480
right, He Chen?

142
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,520
Honey.

143
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,160
Thank you.

144
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,000
Have some tea.

145
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,360
This feels like a scene from my dream.

146
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,800
Dream?

147
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,840
What did you dream about?

148
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,040
There were flowers,

149
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,480
and snow.

150
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,840
You kissed me.

151
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,880
But it was a nightmare.

152
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,320
Why?

153
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,960
Because

154
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,640
that kiss hurt.

155
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,320
Let's break up.

156
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,960
I don't love you anymore.

157
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,680

00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,520
