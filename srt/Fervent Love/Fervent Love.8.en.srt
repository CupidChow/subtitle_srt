Hanxing,

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,240
what are you doing in my room?

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,280
I...

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,240
Did you check my phone?

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,440
What do you want to do?

11
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,320
What do you want to know?

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,160
Tell me!

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,120
I just want to know you better.

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,760
We've been together for so long,

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,520
and even though you're so gentle with me,

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,960
I always feel like I can't see through you.

17
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,640
You said you'd give me a sense of security,

18
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,160
but I feel like I have none at all.

19
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,360
I feel like you're not honest with me.

20
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,880
I haven't been honest with you?

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,760
I'll be honest with you now!

22
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll give you everything now.

23
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,240
I asked you before

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,560
what it means when you come at night.

25
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,640
I won't ask you again.

26
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,600
What happened?

27
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,600
Sorry to interrupt you..

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,200
Zhaozhao is a mischievous cat.

29
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,800
He scratched me and ran off.

30
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,320
He even knocked over...

31
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,520
Be careful next time.

32
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,960
Cats are animals, they have

33
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,360
their wild instincts.

34
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,760
Got it,

35
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,600
I won't bother him again.

36
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,800
Go back and get some rest.

41
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,060

43
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,960
(This place is abandoned.)

44
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,800
Who is he hiding?

45
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,520
Could it be...

46
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,160
(He Chen?)

47
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,120
Someone went upstairs.

48
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,320
Quick, go, go, go!

49
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,560
Hey!

50
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,880
He's upstairs, catch him!

51
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,960
Shh.

52
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,720
I hear something.

53
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,080
You two, come with me.

54
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,920
Okay.

55
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,000
Stop! Don't run!

56
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,650
- Don't run!
- Stop right there!

57
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,000
You two go check over there.

58
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,400
Alright, let's go.

59
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,680
Hey,

60
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,520
what are you doing here?

61
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,140
(Sihuai)

62
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,440
(Zhong Sihuai)
Hanxing, are you home?

63
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,480
He's back.

64
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,640
Ms. Zhang.

65
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,640
Yeah, Mr. Zhong.

66
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,600
Is Hanxing at home?

67
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,040
He hasn't returned yet.

68
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,400
- What about He Chen?
- Mr. He is at home.

69
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,040
I think he is in his room.

70
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,200
You snuck out after going home?

71
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,320
How will you get in later?

72
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,600
What, are you worried about me?

73
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,160
I'm not an ungrateful person.

74
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,680
Boss,

75
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,120
two suspicious people came just now.

76
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,240
Did you recognize them?

77
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,720
I sent the surveillance footage to you.

78
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,670
The footage is unclear though.

79
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,600
(This person looks like...)

80
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,400
Hanxing,

81
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,920
where did you go just now?

82
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,320
Why didn't you answer my call?

83
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,600
I went for a spa.

84
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,080
I was so tired I fell asleep.

85
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,380
Next time, please...

86
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,400
I'm too tired.

87
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,840
I can't keep my eyes open now.

88
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,320
I'll go rest now, Sihuai.

89
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,920
Alright, get some rest.

90
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,760
Hmm.

91
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,200
Why don't you check the top floor?

92
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,720
Mr. He likes to take a bath there.

93
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,080
I'll take off my clothes.

94
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,480
Huh?

95
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,160
What's wrong?

96
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,800
Nothing.

97
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,380
I was just worried about you.

98
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,560
What could happen to me?

99
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
Do you need help?

100
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,800
No,

101
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,520
I'm just lame.

102
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,600
I can still move.

103
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,960
It's too stuffy here.

104
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,520
Don't stay there for long.

105
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,960
Okay.

106
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,800
You still haven't told me,

107
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,880
why were you there?

108
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,240
Were you following me?

109
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,200
I found out that school might have

110
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,320
Zhong Sihuai's secret.

111
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,160
I need something on him,

112
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,440
just in case.

113
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's rare that you trust me.

114
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,720
Not exactly,

115
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,160
it's just that you've saved me so many times.

116
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,240
That proves

117
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,960
you and Zhong Sihuai are not the same type
of person.

118
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,920
Although I don't know what your struggles are,

119
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,920
from now on,

120
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,240
you and I

121
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,480
are no longer enemies.

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,960

Yes.

125
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,040
