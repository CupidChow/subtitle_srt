(Heshi Group)

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,320
Who did the background check for Xinglan?

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,520
Mr. He,

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,640
why are you here?

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,030
Since our last meeting,

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,000
has Xinglan's operating model been optimized?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,840
Oh, yes,

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,960
it has.

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,760
The money in the account

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,920
is less than when Shen Hanxing
sold the painting.

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,280
Has Xinglan not done any business

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,320
since then?

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,640
Mr. He, actually...

19
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,840
I can marry Shen Weixi.

20
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,150
Really?

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,320
But Heshi Group doesn't take on bad assets.

22
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,640
Xinglan can only make money if it's
in Shen Hanxing's hands.

23
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,600
If you want me to marry your daughter,

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,800
the legal representative

25
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,840
of Xinglan must be Shen Hanxing.

26
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,920
Honey.

27
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,000
Why are you here again?

28
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,560
To accompany you to work.

29
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,480
Accompany me to work?

30
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,640
Yes.

31
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,480
As the future Mrs. He,

32
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,600
I have to make an appearance at Heshi Group.

33
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,130
Plus, we're getting married soon,

34
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,800
we need to get to know each other better.

35
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,760
I believe you know better than I do

36
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,840
why we are getting married.

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,520
He Can,

38
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,720
you agreed to this marriage on your own.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,840
No one forced you.

40
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,080
I advise you to prepare for the wedding.

41
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,400
Since I had ways

42
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,720
to make Zhong Sihuai agree to let me move in,

43
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,160
I can definitely make him deal with you.

44
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,160
(So it wasn't Zhong Sihuai who got her here.)

45
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,920
(And)

46
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,760
(she has something on Zhong Sihuai.)

47
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,680
(I need to know what it is.)

48
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,960
Come in.

49
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,120
Uncle,

50
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,160
about the acquisition of Xinglan, I think...

51
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,000
It's fine.

52
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,640
You're not angry?

53
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,640
(He Can has lost his value.)

54
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,720
Whether you get Xinglan doesn't matter.

55
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,960
But He Can must stay.

56
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,760
We need him to play the role of He Can

57
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,320
in Heshi Group and manage it well

58
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,680
until the shareholders' meeting.

59
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,200
He will be our trump card at that time.

60
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,360
Anyway, you've agreed to marry Shen Weixi.

61
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,680
Not acquiring it

62
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,600
saves us some money.

63
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,640
When will get married and hold the wedding?

64
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,960
Miss Shen,

65
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,040
I'm not your personal butler.

66
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,840
I don't care how you do it,

67
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,080
but in two weeks, get him to register
for marriage with me.

68
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,920
And within a month, hold the wedding.

69
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,040
Otherwise, I can't guarantee this video
won't leak.

70
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,200
Understood, Miss Shen.

71
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,960
However,

72
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,760
it's best not to be too greedy.

73
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,680
Video?

74
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,320
Zhong Sihuai, you really have a lot of secrets.

75
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,720
Shen Hanxing.

76
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,960
Sign it.

77
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,620
(Xinglan
Legal Representative Change Agreement)

78
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,260
(Xinglan)
Legal Representative Change?

79
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,160
Aren't you selling Xinglan to Heshi Group?

80
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,520
How could this...

81
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,320
Your father and I don't have time
to handle this.

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,400
Haven't you always wanted Xinglan?

83
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,280
Why didn't my dad come to talk to me himself?

84
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,840
He's busy preparing for Weixi's wedding.

85
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,080
Mr. He personally promised it.

86
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,760
He needs to oversee it himself

87
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,120
to ensure nothing goes wrong.

88
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,640
Shen Weixi

89
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,960
is getting married?

90
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,360
I didn't expect it,

91
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,840
but she managed to secure

92
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,440
what you couldn't.

93
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,280
She's going to be the future Mrs. He.

94
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
It's indeed a joyous occasion.

95
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,800
It's worth celebrating.

96
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,100
(Morning Glory)

97
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,060
(Eucalyptus and Morning Glory)

98
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,980
(When two people in love lock eyes,
tears may fall.)

99
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,620
(Morning Glory)

100
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,480
I'm sorry, Hanxing,

101
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,280
I can't give you love,

102
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,000
but I can give you freedom.

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,960
Do you know what my freedom means?

104
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,240
Heshi Group heir He Chen's big scandal.

105
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,960
A few days ago, He Chen just announced

106
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,320
his engagement to Shen Weixi.

107
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,720
But today,

108
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,600
Shen Weixi's scandalous video,

109
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,160
taken abroad, was leaked online.

110
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,560
(Shen Weixi's scandalous photos)
Even with the blur, the explicit content

111
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,920
is still obvious.

112
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,660
This caused Heshi Group

113
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,440
(Mom)
to fall into a media whirlpool,

114
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,960
with stocks plummeting.

115
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,520
Shen Weixi, what's going on?

116
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,600
Are you trying to kill me?

117
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,840
Mom, let me explain, it's not like that.

118
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
I don't want to hear it.

119
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,160
Heshi Group already called to cancel
the engagement.

120
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,840
I don't care what methods you use,

121
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,400
you must get He Chen back.

122
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,480
Don't worry,

123
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,520
I'll call He Chen right now.

124
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,440
I'll handle it.

125
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,280
I didn't agree to the cancellation

126
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
of the engagement.

127
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,120
Miss Shen,

128
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,440
your personal behavior has caused huge damage
to Heshi Group.

129
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,760
That is a decision by the board of directors.

130
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,760
I'm powerless to stop it.

131
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,200
I...

132
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,520
(How could this video...)

133
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,040
(Who did this?)

134
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,040
(Could it be Shen Hanxing?)

135
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,100
(Shen Hanxing)

136
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,000
Was this video leakage your doing?

137
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,400
You're angry because I'm marrying He Chen,
right?

138
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,920
He's already your ex-boyfriend.

139
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,200
Do you have to stand in my way?

140
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,240
Yes,

141
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,560
I do want to stand in your way.

142
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,720
But sorry,

143
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,080
this wasn't me.

144
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,920
Because relying on a rich man

145
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,680
is nothing special to me.

146
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,000
I don't need to go to such lengths.

147
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,960
I'm busy enough with Xinglan.

148
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,280
Yes,

149
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,840
I rely on men,

150
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,040
but I dare to admit it.

151
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,240
What about you?

152
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,720
Aren't you also relying on men?

153
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,520
You just don't admit it!

154
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,640
You even pretend to be independent and strong.

155
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
Do you know why our parents gave Xinglan
to you?

156
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,800
It's because He Chen talked to us.

157
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,200
He promised to marry me,

158
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,120
but only if Xinglan's legal representative
was you.
