6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,160
You look really beautiful today.

7
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,360
When will we start?

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,880
Now.

9
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,720
Memorize this.

10
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,060
(Interactions Summary
Table of Contents)

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,840
When dining with Mr. Kang,

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,880
you must eat spicy food.

13
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,860
Sweet, dry, off-dry

14
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,480
are the differences in the sweetness of wine,

15
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,960
which is decided by sugar content.

16
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,400
The sweet white Mr. Kang mentioned

17
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,000
refers to sweet white wine.

18
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,180
(London, the UK)

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,160
Late harvest and noble rot

20
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,320
are two winemaking methods to increase
sugar content.

21
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,080
The former is literally as it sounds.

22
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,560
What does that mean?

23
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,560
It means harvesting the grapes later,

24
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,680
letting them dry out,

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,800
losing moisture,

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,040
and concentrating the sugar.

27
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,800
The latter is based on the former,

28
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,880
using grapes infected with noble rot
to make wine.

29
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,720
Noble rot?

30
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,600
Yes,

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,120
a non-toxic fungus,

32
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,160
which can enhance sweetness and flavor.

33
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,160
Mhm.

34
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,760
See if you can tell the difference
between the front and aftertaste.

35
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,600
Aftertaste?

36
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,040
Where's the aftertaste?

37
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,240
The front taste is here?

38
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,360
The front taste is the flavor as soon as
it enters your mouth.

39
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,280
Did you taste it?

40
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,520
It's

41
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,480
just alcohol.

42
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,760
How's that?

43
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,960
I

44
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,040
really can only taste the alcohol.

45
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,960
Try to savor it in your mouth.

46
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,800
There's

47
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,800
a taste of honey.

48
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,720
Very sweet, right?

49
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,560
Yes.

50
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,960
Noble rot's sweetness is more intense
than late harvest.

51
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,320
Honey and almonds are the main flavors.

52
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,200
Here.

53
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,320
This is late harvest.

54
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,400
These wines are weak.

55
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,280
Remember,

56
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,000
He Chen's alcohol tolerance

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,960
isn't that good.

58
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,160
Like

59
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,720
this?

60
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,760
Go

61
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,760
play a song for me.

62
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,200
I learned the violin,

63
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
so I'm not too good at the piano.

64
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,040
Not too good means you can still play.

65
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,560
He Can,

66
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,760
where is He Chen?

67
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,440
He's abroad.

68
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,560
Still in the US?

69
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,160
Which hospital?

70
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,360
How is Hanxing working at Heshi Group?

71
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,760
This isn't appropriate.

72
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,120
I couldn't do anything about it,

73
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,960
Uncle.

74
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,040
She is your fiancée.

75
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,520
She's right next to me.

76
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,400
You can talk to her.

77
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,280
Sihuai,

78
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,560
you know about Xinglan's situation now.

79
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,040
Joining Heshi Group is a learning opportunity
for me.

80
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,240
If you want to learn, you can always
come work beside me.

81
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,800
We've just gotten engaged,

82
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,280
it's not appropriate.

83
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,920
Hanxing,

84
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,080
I'm not complaining about you.

85
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,960
How about this,

86
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,400
let's talk after I come back.

87
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,750
Okay.

88
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,920
You rest well.

89
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,040
You're getting bolder now.

90
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,840
I'm only gone for a few days

91
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,760
and you dare touch my woman.

92
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,400
If you like her so much, why did you

93
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,080
short-sell Xinglan and make things difficult
for her?

94
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,120
You are a son of a gambler,

95
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,840
do you know what liking someone means?

96
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,200
Hanxing is the kind of woman

97
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,280
who only comes to me

98
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,320
when she has nothing left.

99
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,840
Only when Xinglan is at a dead end
and I help her

100
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,880
will she truly belong to me.

101
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,840
Originally, if I just continued
shorting Xinglan,

102
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,440
she would have accepted Heshi Group's
investment,

103
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,960
accepted my help.

104
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,480
But you

105
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,440
messed up my plan.

106
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,680
He Can,

107
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,320
have you been pretending to be He Chen
for so long

108
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,880
that you've forgotten who you are?

109
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,280
No.

110
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,200
You saved me.

111
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,680
You are my savior.

112
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,320
I'm glad you know that.

113
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,280
Don't forget

114
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,520
what you promised me.

115
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,240
To help you get Heshi Group.

116
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,840
Remember,

117
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,040
don't do things you shouldn't do,

118
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,200
don't touch people you shouldn't touch.

119
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,040
For example, Shen Hanxing.

120
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,400
I understand.

121
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,000
Uncle,

122
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,680
there's new progress on the resort project.

123
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,520
Mr. Kang specifically requested

124
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,080
for Shen Hanxing to help.

125
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,440
I didn't expect

126
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,480
Mr. Kang always

127
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,240
thought so highly of Shen Hanxing.

128
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,840
He's been wanting to give her
the responsibility

129
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,640
of the resort's art gallery section.

130
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,440
I know the resort project is important to you,

131
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,480
so I had to go along with Mr. Kang's wishes

132
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,160
and ask Hanxing to help.

133
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,920
Don't take matters into your own hands again.

134
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,080
Otherwise,

135
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,120
I'll make you go back to where you came from.

136
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,280
(Zhong Sihuai,)

137
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,720
(so it was you.)

138
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,380
Madam, Mr. He Can was indeed sent
to our hospital

139
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,040
after that traffic accident,

140
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,240
but he has been transferred.

141
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,840
Currently, his attending physician, Dr. Huang,
has departed.

142
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,480
Besides, his relative has already taken
the transfer records.

143
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,400
You can directly contact him.

144
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,160
Thank you.

145
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,480
Relative?

146
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,000
The coffee here is pretty good.

147
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,220
I used to come here often.

148
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,250
I'm bringing you to try it today.

149
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,550
What's wrong?

150
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,160
It's just that my stepmother has a bad temper.

151
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,400
It's fine.

152
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,400
I've gotten used to it.

153
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,760
What's wrong?

154
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,600
Come with me.

155
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,560
Starting today,

156
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,120
Hanxing will move in here.

157
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,360
Uncle, you are really impatient.

158
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,680
Now that Hanxing is living with us,

159
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,280
mind your manners.

160
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,400
Is it still hurting?

161
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,640
It's fine. It's just a slap mark.

162
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,120
It'll disappear soon.

163
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,880
Hanxing, you won't

164
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,800
blame me for being impatient, will you?

165
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,120
How could I?

166
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,840
I think,

167
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,640
since you'll have to move in after the wedding
anyway,

168
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,280
might as well do it earlier.

169
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,160
Moreover,

170
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,400
I want to see you every day.

171
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,400
When I open my eyes in the morning

172
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,720
and before I sleep at night,

173
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,600
I want you to be there.

174
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,520
Sihuai,

175
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,080
how about we treat this as a trial marriage?

176
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,320
Trial marriage?

177
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,800
Although we've known each other
for a long time,

178
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,640
we were never like a normal couple.

179
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,960
We never experienced what a normal couple
should experience.

180
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,960
We should take this opportunity

181
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,400
to understand each other better.

182
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,360
Okay?

183
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,520
I don't want everything to move too fast.

184
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,070
Don't worry,

185
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,520
I'll wait for you to be ready,

186
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,120
to trust me completely.

187
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,720
I'll give you he sense of security

188
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,750
you're missing.

189
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,370
Thank you,

190
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,380
Sihuai.

191
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,190
Sorry to interrupt.

192
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,280
Uncle,

193
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,520
I need to confirm some things about
the art gallery with her.

194
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,500
Don't talk about work at home.

195
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,180
I'll show you to your room.

196
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,380
Rest well today.

197
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,380
Call me anytime.

198
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,940
Okay.

199
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,940
(Zhong Sihuai,)

200
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,620
(where would you keep)

201
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,780
(that transfer record?)

202
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,340
Sihuai.

203
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,660
Come in.

204
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,020
What's wrong?

205
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,900
This is the dessert I made.

206
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,580
I brought it to you to try,

207
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,980
see if you like it.

208
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,100
I also want to see your room.

209
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,660
Sit down.

210
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,700
Try it.

211
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,300
Sihuai,

212
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,420
we've been together for so long, but

213
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,660
we've never taken a picture together.

214
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,420
How about we take one,

215
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,220
to celebrate this new beginning?

216
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,500
Okay.

217
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,260
