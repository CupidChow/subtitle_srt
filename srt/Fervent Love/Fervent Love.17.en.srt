=Episode 17=

6
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,400
Young lady, if you don't understand wine,

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,480
please don't say so perfunctorily.

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,560
Where is your manager?

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,440
Sorry, sir.

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,520
She's new.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,680
You can tell me your needs.

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,920
How can I help you?

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,760
Okay.

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,480
Could you recommend me the white wine?

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,960
I want

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,880
sweet

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,360
but not overly sweet.

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,520
And my wife

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,880
prefers fruit flavor.

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,400
So

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,520
I advise you to choose No. 5.

22
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,640
It's made by Pinot Gris

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,240
from Domaine Zind-Humbrecht in 2007.

24
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,840
This winery in Alsace

25
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,280
is known for SGN Pinot Gris.

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,920
Its acidity perfectly balances
its high sweetness.

27
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,280
Yeah. How do you think?

28
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,280
Yeah, it's okay for me.

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,240
So that's the one.

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,720
It's 210 pounds per bottle.

31
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,600
I hope you'll enjoy it.

32
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,440
Okay.

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,080
Go get the wine now.

34
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,000
Thank you, sir.

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,080
Thank you so much.

36
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,600
Thank you.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,920
It's you.

38
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,550
Ah.

39
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,480
Thanks for today.

40
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,160
No need to thank me.

41
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,120
Shen Hanxing.

42
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,960
He...

43
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,840
He Chen?

44
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,600
You finally recognized me.

45
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,000
We haven't seen each other since
college graduation.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,800
You came to the UK for your master's degree?

47
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,910
Yes.

48
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,760
And you?

49
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,360
I came to work part-time,

50
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,660
to earn tuition and living expenses.

51
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,880
I really appreciate what you did for me today.

52
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,920
That was my first big deal since I started
working here.

53
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,440
Just the service charge for
that bottle of wine alone is £30.

54
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,600
It's enough to cover my meals for a week.

55
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,040
What did you put in the wine earlier?

56
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,320
Why did it suddenly turn purple?

57
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,280
Butterfly pea flower tea.

58
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,140
Because the red in the wine was too dark,

59
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,840
I added a little lemon juice

60
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,880
and cobalt blue butterfly pea flower tea.

61
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,920
That's why the purple turned out so perfect.

62
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,400
I think

63
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,280
it looks beautiful and tastes great.

64
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,880
It's just

65
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,160
a bit sweet,

66
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,120
but I didn't want to add bitters.

67
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,440
Because the bitterness of bitters

68
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,040
is just too industrial.

69
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,560
Can I come in?

70
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,880
Yeah.

71
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,200
Try it.

72
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,520
It's good!

73
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,320
This bitterness

74
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,310
is a warm kind of bitterness.

75
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,280
Warm bitterness?

76
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,120
Yes.

77
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,040
You try it too.

78
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,960
Sweet and bitter,

79
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
mysterious and intense,

80
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
with a little sourness.

81
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
Let's give it a name.

82
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,840
Okay,

83
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,880
I'll have to think about it.

84
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,000
Hey,

85
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,160
it's already this late.

86
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,080
Aren't you going home?

87
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,960
Oh,

88
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,360
I'll go home now.

89
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,080
By the way, He Chen,

90
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,520
you really know a lot about wine.

91
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,040
Did you study it on purpose?

92
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,280
These bottles and jars are so difficult for me.

93
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,400
It's way harder than studying art history.

94
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,240
You...

95
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,960
I am free on Wednesday, Friday,
and Sunday afternoons.

96
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,360
Pick a time.

97
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,560
Huh?

98
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,960
Do you want to learn it?

99
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,840
I mean these bottles and jars.

100
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,200
Shen Hanxing,

101
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,440
how can you

102
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,160
love He Chen

103
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,960
and also have feelings for He Can?

104
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,400
You're so selfish.

105
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,000
You're a selfish woman.

106
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,470
You

107
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,280
don't

108
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,960
deserve

109
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,240
to have love.

110
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,200
But

111
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,120
it's okay.

112
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,160
From today on,

113
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,760
Xinglan

114
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,880
is yours.

115
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,360
It's just yours, Shen Hanxing.

116
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,200
Shen Hanxing,

117
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,690
you're free now.

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,400
This Christmas holiday is a month long,

119
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,720
let's travel.

120
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,360
Sure.

121
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,320
Is there anywhere you want to go?

122
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,080
I'm fine with anywhere.

123
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,120
How about you?

124
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,520
Well,

125
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,840
let's go see windmills, okay?

126
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,680
Why windmills?

127
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,160
It feels so free.

128
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,840
Alright.

129
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,240
I also want to take you to

130
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,520
our Xinglan's

131
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,800
art gallery.

132
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,160
Why?

133
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,200
Because Xinglan

134
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,760
is the place I think is the most free.

135
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,720
My freedom

136
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,600
is Xinglan.

137
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,920
Alright.

138
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,200

00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,840
You're He Chen?

00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,160
