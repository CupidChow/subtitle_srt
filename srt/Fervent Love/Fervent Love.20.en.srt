Don't worry,

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,080
I'll keep an eye on him,

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,720
I'll make sure nothing gets out.

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,080
Get him back.

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,680
Mr. He,

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,000
Mr. Zhong has already acquired

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,520
5% of the shares from the small shareholders,

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,240
so now you're on par with him.

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,320
I heard he also

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,440
went to see Mr. Bai recently.

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,280
He Can.

18
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,800
If we don't act soon...

19
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,920
I got it.

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,240
What's the matter?

21
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,920
Thank you for coming to save me.

22
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,640
When you saw I was in danger,

23
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,720
you got worried, didn't you?

24
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,120
I knew where you were.

25
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,440
I couldn't just do nothing.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,680
What's going on between you and Zhong Sihuai?

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,680
Why did you hide He Chen

28
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,200
in that shabby place?

29
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,320
What are you trying to do?

30
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,720
Mind your own business.

31
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,520
Pretend you don't know some things.

32
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,200
Zhong Sihuai wanted to harm me,

33
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,560
but you saved me,

34
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,400
so you two

35
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,880
are having a conflict?

36
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,480
We are not engaged anymore,

37
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,400
don't come to my room again.

38
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,240
He Can,

39
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,920
how could you cancel the engagement?

40
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,040
Didn't you already know about

41
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,040
everything that happened?

42
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,440
Is it because of Shen Hanxing?

43
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,760
I noticed it on your birthday.

44
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,200
Zhong Sihuai

45
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,640
doesn't know you had feelings for her, huh?

46
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,840
Shen Hanxing

47
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,720
is with Zhong Sihuai

48
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,720
while keeping you dangling.

49
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,880
Everyone scolds me,

50
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,080
but I don't think she's any more virtuous
than me.

51
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,560
How dare you say that?

52
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,360
Shen Hanxing did two part-time jobs
to support herself

53
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,520
while studying abroad.

54
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,000
But you spent your family's money recklessly,

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,400
living a lavish life of excess.

56
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,520
In the end, Shen Hanxing sold her paintings
to cover your losses.

57
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,680
What do you think?

58
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,880
(How does he know about Shen Hanxing's time
in the UK?)

59
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,360
(He didn't even know her back then.)

60
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,760
(Could it be...)

61
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,960
If you want to break off the engagement,

62
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,880
then the joint bank card we share in the US

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,840
should belong to me.

64
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,160
Fine.

65
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,600
No wonder you have no attachment to me.

66
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,960
It turns out

67
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,680
you're not He Can.

68
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,920
Check on Xinglan,

69
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,760
see what Shen Hanxing is up to lately.

70
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,840
Why can't I reach you?

71
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,800
What are you hiding here for?

72
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,520
Shen Weixi,

73
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,640
I advise you to get lost while I still

74
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,200
have patience. Otherwise,

75
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,440
next time you won't be so lucky to escape.

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,080
I knew it was you.

77
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,520
You idiot, you didn't even

78
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,000
realize that the He Can in front of you
is a fake,

79
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,480
and you dared to kidnap me.

80
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,280
Say it again.

81
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,240
I said,

82
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,680
he didn't want to marry me

83
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,640
because he isn't He Can.

84
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,620
He's He Chen.

85
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,120
Are you sure?

86
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,040
Of course.

87
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,720
He doesn't even know that we never shared

88
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,560
a bank card in the US.

89
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,760
Uncle,

90
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,760
you believe Shen Weixi's nonsense?

91
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,560
What I believe doesn't matter,

92
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,080
what's important is the truth.

93
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,080
Since she's so certain,

94
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,320
why don't you prove her wrong

95
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,600
so she can give up?

96
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,760
Shen Weixi,

97
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,920
you were so heartless when you broke up
with me,

98
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,280
and now you expect me to come back to you?

99
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,680
If you're not He Chen,

100
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,360
why do you care so much about Shen Hanxing?

101
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,240
I care about Shen Hanxing?

102
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,360
What do you mean? Do you have evidence?

103
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,720
Don't be in such a hurry to argue.

104
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,560
You're just relying on having the same face
as He Can.

105
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,200
Do you dare to face

106
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,280
our shared history?

107
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,440
Whatever I say, you'll just deny it.

108
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,640
So

109
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,000
I have written down the answers.

110
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,160
Uncle, please be the judge for us.

111
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,400
Alright.

112
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,360
What do you think?

113
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,600
He Can, where did we first meet?

114
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,760
Who suggested breaking up?

115
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,360
What was the first gift I gave you?

116
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,160
Giant Sequoia Road in California,

117
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,160
you suggested breaking up.

118
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,400
What was the first gift I gave you?

119
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,360
Say it.

120
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,480
You don't know, do you?

121
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,680
If that cheap kiss doesn't count,

122
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,320
you never gave me any gift.

123
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,240
Shen Weixi,

124
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,320
this is the last time

125
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,120
I'll play this silly game with you.

126
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,080
How is that possible?

127
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,900
(Giant Sequoia Road, Me, Kiss)

128
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,080
Your turn, Chen.

129
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,440
Good job, Can.

130
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,580
(West Garden Cemetery)

131
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,680
Staying at the cemetery this late?

132
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,600
Could He Can be...

133
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,880
He is not dead.

134
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,560
Could it be

135
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,160
they hid him here?

136
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,720
How could they hide him in a cemetery?

137
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,000
He Can.

138
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,200
From now on, you'll be my boss.

139
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,760
I'll do whatever you tell me.

140
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,720
I'll listen to you.

141
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,840
Hello?

142
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,960
I need an ambulance.

143
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,920
West Garden Cemetery.

144
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,160
Yes.

145
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,880
With Zhong Sihuai's personality,

146
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,080
he trusts you now,

147
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,320
but he won't trust you completely.

148
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
He's been buying Heshi's shares

149
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,760
from the shareholders.

150
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,000
This game should be over soon.

151
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,840
Chen,

152
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,680
what if he finds out I'm not there?

153
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,480
Don't worry,

154
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,800
he doesn't know where you are.

155
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,000
What about Liu Jingyao?

156
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,240
I've arranged some other matters for her:

157
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,040
the share acquisition she cares about most.

158
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,800
She won't be back for ten days.

159
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,840
So we must stop them within the next ten days.
