00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,700
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

7
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,800
Get up.

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,610
The shareholder meeting is

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,800
moved forward. Notify all shareholders,

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,280
it'll be held

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,720
in five days,

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,240
at 1 pm sharp.

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,320
Mr. Zhong, won't you wait for Lawyer Liu?

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,360
Yes, yes.

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,760
(He Can,)

16
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,640
(the mask game)

17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,560
(is about to end.)

18
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,860
Can, what do you want for dinner?

19
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,540
(He Chen: Can, what do you want for dinner?)

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,040
Hello, Hanxing.

21
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,400
He Chen,

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,640
the hotel called.

23
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,720
He Can checked out this morning.

24
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,960
Huh?

25
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,920
Sorry, the user you are calling is unavailable.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,040
(He Can)
Chen,

27
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,600
stop calling me.

28
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,480
I've been thinking it.

29
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,400
I just want a peaceful life.

30
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,280
I don't want to get involved with
He family matters.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,880
I'm leaving, don't look for me.

32
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,680
I wish you happiness.

33
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,260
(Your account 3433 has received $2,000,000.)

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,680
(He Chen)
Go to your favorite Vienna,

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,480
live the life you want.

36
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,480
Don't worry,

37
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,760
don't feel guilty.

38
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,720
This will always be your home.

39
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,400
Why are you back so soon?

40
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,760
If I didn't come back,

41
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,640
you'd be causing trouble.

42
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,720
Who allowed you to move the meeting forward?

43
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,040
He Zhao is probably waking up soon.

44
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,160
I don't have a choice.

45
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,480
By the way,

46
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,760
how did it go?

47
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,400
Mr. Liu has decided to transfer his shares
to Zhong Sihuai.

48
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,440
Why did Mr. Liu change sides?

49
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,010
Did Liu Jingyao manage to win him over?

50
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,840
But Mr. Liu is Grandpa's good friend.

51
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,280
No matter what,

52
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,120
we've lost a trump card.

53
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,760
Why do you keep coming to this café lately?

54
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,960
Is the coffee that good?

55
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,640
You're

56
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,000
the one from the video.

57
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,360
Zhong Sihuai

58
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,880
would never kidnap anyone.

59
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,520
So you kidnapped me.

60
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,720
What's your relationship with Zhong Sihuai?

61
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,760
That's none of your business.

62
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,760
What you need to know is,

63
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,400
I want to play a game with you now.

64
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,040
You have two choices:

65
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,440
One, give me the video

66
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,760
and go back to America.

67
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,760
Two,

68
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,960
I can kidnap you again,

69
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,960
but this time,

70
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,960
I might kill you.

71
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,640
The meeting is at 1 pm tomorrow,

72
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,200
be sure to bring the stuff and show up on time.

73
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,240
(Shen Hanxing: The message has been rejected.)

74
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,200
(She blocked me.)

75
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,040
(This is bad.)

76
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,460
(Western Garden Cemetery)

77
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,290
- Can.
- Chen.

78
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,080
That woman has gone to the cemetery again.

79
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,680
Should I go back there?

80
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,720
No,

81
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,640
I can't let you get into danger again.

82
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,840
I'm going there now,

83
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,360
she won't go into that room in front of me.

84
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,580
(Memorial to Father Zhong Songde,
Mother Liu Ling)

85
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,480
I was on a business trip a few days ago,

86
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,840
just came back yesterday.

87
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,640
I'm bringing you food today.

88
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,280
Sorry I'm a bit late.

89
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
You won't blame me, will you?

90
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,240
So this is how it is.

91
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,440
You followed me?

92
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,920
As a pawn, I can't be unprepared.

93
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,040
Apart from Sihuai,

94
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,920
I never allow anyone else here.

95
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,800
But recently, you've helped us a lot,

96
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,960
so I'll treat you as a guest.

97
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,360
I didn't expect that

98
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,480
he actually has a sister.

99
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,360
We ended up like this

100
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,160
because of your He family.

101
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,320
You made me play my brother's role,

102
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,520
helping you seize Heshi.

103
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,800
Why?

104
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,760
I'm just taking back what belongs to me.

105
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,320
Back then,

106
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,400
He Zhao embezzled,

107
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,000
but made my father take the blame,

108
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,720
that's why he committed suicide.

109
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,520
Look.

110
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,420
(May 13, 2006, July 6, 2006)
Every year on your birthday,

111
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,200
it's also my father's death anniversary.

112
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,000
Don't you afraid I'll run away?

113
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,800
The shareholder meeting is in the afternoon.

114
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,760
Whether you run or not doesn't matter.

115
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,960
If you don't show up,

116
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,320
I'll have another reason to impeach He Chen.

117
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,000
I'll be there.

118
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:24,740
(General Meeting of Shareholders
of Heshi Group)

119
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,480
Looks like the bad guy

120
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,120
has to be me.

121
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,480
All the shareholders are busy people,

122
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,000
gathered here

123
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,920
for the most important matter.

124
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,760
If you ask me,

125
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,280
He Chen is still a bit inexperienced.

126
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,640
That round of layoffs,

127
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,720
they called it reform,

128
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,280
but it hurt the old employees' hearts.

129
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,480
But the performance is evident.

130
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,880
Mr. Kang's project kept being delayed,

131
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,600
seriously affecting our cash flow.

132
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,720
If it weren't for Mr. He,

133
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,960
we wouldn't have gotten the final payment.

134
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,800
And there's the Winding Mountain Villa project.

135
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,840
I heard Mr. Zhong secured that project, right?

136
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,920
The group's problems are obvious,

137
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,000
so don't keep your thoughts to yourselves.

138
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,560
Let's vote.

139
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,520
Let's vote.

140
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,640
Come on.

141
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,240
If you think He Chen should step down,

142
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,200
