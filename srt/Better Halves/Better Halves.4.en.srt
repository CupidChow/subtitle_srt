I guess
Qi Shaoheng doesn't want to get married.

for his own amusement.

8
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,180
Not necessarily.

00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,700
I won't be satisfied today unless I eat

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,170

Do you think

the incense Qi Shaoheng is using today

17
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,520
smelt kind of familiar?

18
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,350
It had a refreshing scent like tea.

19
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,910
I noticed it too.

She raised Qi Shaoheng on her own.

00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,159
I had decided

130
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,790
to part from him early,

131
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,310
so he could marry someone more suitable.

to help them become husband and wife.

142

All Qi Shaoheng does
is spread rumors about himself

143
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,600
and delay the wedding.

144
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,580
What can she possibly do?

145
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,090
Then tell me,

146
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,010
what brilliant plan do you have

147
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,470
that can put Mrs. Qi at ease

148
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,460
and won't break his lover's heart?

149
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
A real man could just elope,

150

just for...

151
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,390
Luan'er, don't listen to his nonsense.

152
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,140
With betrothal gifts, you'll be his wife.
If you elope, you'll just be a concubine.

153
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,740
As a matchmaker,
I don't encourage elopement.

154
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,020
Meeting me is your lucky break.

155
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,640
Since Mrs. Qi wants
a daughter-in-law from a noble family,

156
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,100
we'll just give her what she wants.

The fewer people know about this,
the better.

We can't let Ms. Deng find out.

00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,630
My family
has been running a tea stall for years.

188
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,650
So I know a little.

189
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,390
Miss Liu,
the way you did it is a bit improper.

190
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,920
In noble households in the capital,

191
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,530
after a young lady serves tea to an elder,

192
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,720
she must take a step back,

193
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,880
listen to the elder's advice,
and then serve the next cup.

194
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,480
Lu.

195
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,060
Luan'er, don't be discouraged.

196
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,870
Those are just formalities.

197
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,310
But since we're presenting you to Mrs. Qi,

198
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,740
we do need to be strict with etiquette.

199
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,670
Girls from noble families in the capital
all learn tea arts.

200
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,160
Luan'er, brewing and preparing tea
is your strength.

201
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,560
Plus proper etiquette,

202
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,230
Mrs. Qi will surely see you
as a noble lady.

203
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,970
And with the help of me, a matchmaker,

204
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,100
I guarantee Mrs. Qi will be satisfied.

205
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,350
I see.

206
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,000
For Shaoheng's sake, I'm willing to learn.

207
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,720
Ms. Li.

208
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,460
What can I do for you?

209
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,680
Take Miss Liu to pick some nice outfits.

210
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,470
Miss, come with me.

211
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,040
This way, please.

212
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:25,620
Lu,

213
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,250
did you cast a spell on Pan'er?

214
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,290
She's been so calculating about money,

215
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,050
yet she didn't even ask how you'd pay.

216
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,310
Ke, you guessed right.

217
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,760
Lu,

218
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,770
have you lost your mind?

219
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,450
You want to know?

220
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,420
Once you complete this matchmaking case,

221
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,220
I'll reward you with the answer.

222
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,900
It's a deal.

223
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,440
Deal.

224
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:58,030
Last time's pinky promise
was for the engagement.

225
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,090
That was exclusive to the little boy.

226
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,160
Why not complete the pinky promise?

227
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,590
I trust you,

228
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,150
so there's no need for that.

229
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,490
Come on, let's go get changed too.

230
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,430
Lu.

231
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,970
I still feel like something's missing.

232
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:22,980
What's missing?

233
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,750
A father.

234
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,060
That's really not necessary.

235
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,720
Don't get the wrong idea.

236
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,550
I mean Luan'er
still lacks a decent father.

237
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,890
I think you're the one
getting the wrong idea.

238
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,150
Shouldn't you marriage brokers

239
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,600
act with honesty and integrity?

240
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,870
I came up with this plan

241
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,160
to rescue my parents from prison.

242
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,910
You know how difficult my position is

243
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,970
in the Official Matchmaking Agency.

244
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,240
Just pretend I didn't hear that.

245
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,120
Lu,

246
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,550
why won't you help me?

247
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,870
You don't want to help me?

248
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,820
Because...

249
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:58,990
I have dignity.

250
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,610
I really can't think of another way.

251
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,630
I...

252
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:18,810
Young Master,

253
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,900
I want to ask you for a favor.

254
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,000
Will you help me or not?

255
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,080
Yeah.

256
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:29,370
Yes... or no?

257
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,680
Since she's asking for your help,

258
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,570
just say yes.

259
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,070
Yes. Yes.

260
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:46,970
My Lord.

261
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,970
Has Qi Shaoheng agreed to marry

262
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,810
the Grand Tutor's daughter?

263
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,100
Qi Shaoheng

264
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,160
truly has a strange temper.

265
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,020
I found out he's in love with someone.

266
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,200
That's why he won't marry
the Grand Tutor's daughter.

267
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,340
But don't worry, My Lord.

268
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,600
Shi Fa'ke has arranged a blind date
for that woman,

269
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,050
but I'm sure I can break them up.

270
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,840
Can you really

271
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,890
influence Qi Shaoheng?

272
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,150
That damned Shi Fa'ke.

273
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,610
She's made me lose all face.

274
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,840
Just you wait.

275
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,570
I won't let you succeed.

276
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,270
Even I must get changed to receive them?

277
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,000
Right now, only you
can keep Qi Shaoheng in check.

278
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,230
I remember you said

279
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,670
you enjoy helping others.

280
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,200
I'm a person of loyalty too.

281
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,260
If they can have a happy marriage,

282
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,650
I will do whatever I can

283
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,760
to thank you for your help today.

284
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,190
It's a deal?

285
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,700
It's a deal.

286
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:52,960
Tell me,

287
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,200
what exactly

288
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,430
are you two up to?

289
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,760
Mrs. Qi,

290
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,600
I have a business deal
I'd like to propose.

291
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,140
What kind of business?

292
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,390
What exactly are you planning?

293
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,820
To fulfill your wish:

294
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,290
having a happy marriage
with your loved one.

295
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:11,910
You...

296
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,270
Stop talking. Watch.

297
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,670
What's written in the invitation is nice.

298
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:17,840
But...

299
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,070
business at the escort agency
indeed has been slow lately.

300
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,200
If we can close a deal, it would be nice.

301
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:22,810
Mrs. Qi,

302
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,350
that father and daughter
are just passing through the capital.

303
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,940
They hope to bring
some calligraphy and paintings back home.

304
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,290
After thinking about it,

305
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,910
I figured only Weiyuan Escort Agency
can complete such an important task.

306
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,920
The young lady seems the right age,

307
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,140
and she is beautiful.

308
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,060
So I invited you to meet her.

309
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,340
He has a daughter?

310
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,990
Miss Shi, you're so clever—

311
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,680
arranging business and a marriage
at the same time.

312
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,040
Please don't mind, Mrs. Qi.

313
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,670
Since Mr. Qi has entrusted me
with his marriage,

314
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,270
there's nothing wrong with me

315
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,130
introducing young ladies to you.

316
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,090
That's true.

317
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,470
Please.

318
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,730
Luan...

319
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,530
If you want this to work, stay quiet.

320
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,220
Miss Shi,

321
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,230
this is the madam you invited?

322
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,590
Madam, please sit. I'll serve you tea.

323
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,240
Miss Shi.

324
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,640
This young lady is truly beautiful.

325
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,520
Madam, why don't you sit
and taste the tea?

326
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,010
Her tea art surpasses her beauty.

327
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:54,760
Okay.

328
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:09,440
You must be

329
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,650
Mrs. Qi from Weiyuan Escort Agency.

330
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,859
Sir,

331
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,160
it's better for me to do the talking.

332
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,480
Mrs. Qi,

333
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,609
this gentleman bought

334
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,589
some artwork and treasures in the capital.

335
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,440
He would like to entrust them
to your escort agency,

336
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,500
to ensure safety on the journey home.

337
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,170
Then... has the young lady come of age?

338
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,390
Is she engaged to anyone in her hometown?

339
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,240
Somehow,

340
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,230
this young lady looks familiar.

341
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,610
Like I've seen her before.

342
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,700
That's wonderful.

343
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,880
It means you two are destined to meet.

344
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,210
Luan'er has come of age,

345
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,570
but is not yet engaged.

346
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,720
It's a pity.

347
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,500
They're heading back home tomorrow.

348
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,000
Luan'er and I hit it off immediately.

349
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,800
I really don't want her to leave.

350
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,200
Miss Shi, you're a marriage broker.

351
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:07,010
If you can help find her a good marriage,

352
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,540
that would be perfect.

353
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,920
I was thinking the same.

354
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,200
If Luan'er marries in the capital,

355
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:18,520
her father goes home
to sell his house and land,

356
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,970
and then returns to the capital
to reunite with her,

357
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,430
wouldn't that be perfect?

358
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,930
My story is perfect.

359
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,990
I'll just say
he ran into bandits on the way.

360
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,590
He was robbed of everything

361
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,000
and disappeared.

362
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,120
[Xibao Pavilion]

363
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,810
After you go in,
go upstairs and turn right.

364
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,520
The last private room is the one.

365
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,120
Miss Shi specially asked me
to invite you here.

366
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,580
Ms. Deng.

367
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,630
Why did Miss Shi ask me here?

368
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,000
She called Luan'er away

369
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
and called me here.

370
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,600
There's no one to watch the tea stall now.

371
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,590
Of course it's about Luan'er's marriage.

372
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,610
Miss Shi

373
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,540
has found

374
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,970
a wonderful family for her.

375
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,370
She specially invited you
to go take a look.

376
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,070
[Xibao Pavilion]

377
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,230
That's great.

378
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,810
Thank you, Ms. Deng.

379
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,030
Don't mention it. Go now.

380
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:04,650
Okay.

381
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,190
Miss Shi.

382
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,800
Is there anyone suitable?

383
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,600
Of course.

384
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,470
I just don't know
Mrs. Qi and Mr. Qi's thoughts.

385
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,740
I'm very satisfied with this young lady.

386
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,920
Really?

387
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:41,930
Luan'er.

388
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,160
Luan'er.

389
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,350
Luan'er.

390
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,580
Luan'er, you're already here.

391
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,180
You look great in this outfit.

392
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,260
Why didn't you tell me when you came?

393
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,400
Miss Shi,

394
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,680
I heard you want to discuss
my daughter's marriage with me.

395
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,240
Sir,

396
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,830
you must be in the wrong room.

397
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,890
Come with me to check the room next door.

398
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:16,400
Let's go.

399
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,110
No.

400
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,790
Ms. Deng personally told me

401
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,320
to come here to see Miss Shi.

402
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,550
She said she wanted to arrange a marriage
for my daughter.

403
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,640
I'll take you to check the room next door.

404
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,050
Come on.

405
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:25,610
Wait.

406
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,550
Your surname is Liu?

407
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:37,130
My family has let you
use our land rent-free for years.

408
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,210
Is that true?

409
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,390
So this young lady
is the daughter of the tea stall's owner.

410
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,240
All of you—

411
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,120
what a show you've put on!

412
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,270
Mrs. Qi, it was not like that.

413
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:53,130
-Please listen to me. It really wasn't...
-Enough!

414
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:56,900
I... I'm not... I...

415
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,340
Yes, Mrs. Qi.

416
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,210
I'm the daughter of the tea stall's owner,

417
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,330
not a noble lady.

418
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,320
You deceitful Liu Luan'er.

419
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:08,700
The Qi family kindly let you do business
on our land without paying rent,

420
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,720
yet you're pretending
to be a noble lady to deceive me.

421
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,980
You even want to marry into the Qi family!

422
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:13,900
Mother.

423
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,150
It was all a misunderstanding.

424
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,750
Luan'er isn't that kind of person.

425
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,820
It was all my idea.

426
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,710
I want to marry Luan'er,

427
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,350
so I asked her to...

428
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,080
Shut up!

429
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,670
Go home with me right now!

430
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,700
-Mother.
-Mrs. Qi.

431
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,170
Mother!

432
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:29,640
Let's go!

433
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,100
Mrs. Qi!

434
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:31,950
Shaoheng.

435
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,270
-Luan'er.
-Let's go!

436
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,390
I...

437
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:41,890
I'm sorry.

438
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,700
It's all my fault.

439
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,680
I didn't expect Ms. Deng

440
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,170
to receive the news at the last moment.

441
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,270
I shouldn't have come up
with that bad idea.

442
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,940
I've implicated Luan'er.

443
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,640
Ke, don't blame yourself.

444
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,130
I was careless.

445
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,590
But...

446
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,730
the truth being exposed
isn't entirely a bad thing.

447
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,660
How is it not?

448
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,080
At least Mr. Qi doesn't need
to hide his feelings anymore.

449
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:29,530
No, it's all my fault.

450
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,920
I shouldn't have wished
for something beyond my reach.

451
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,720
I shouldn't have aimed too high.

452
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,060
No, it's all my fault.

453
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,030
I should've had better judgment.

454
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,010
I still got tricked even at my age.

455
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,800
Is this some kind of confession meeting?

456
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,840
If anyone's to blame, it's me.

457
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,030
It's all my fault.

458
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,160
I forgot the original aspiration
of being a matchmaker my mother told me.

459
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,650
Thank you, Ke.

460
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,900
Actually, I'm happy today.

461
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,010
I tried.

462
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,710
Even if I can't marry Shaoheng
in this life,

463
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,260
I'll have no regrets.

464
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,290
Luan'er,

465
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,290
aren't you angry or upset?

466
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,600
Don't you resent that stubborn Mrs. Qi?

467
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:10,190
I don't hate her. I'm not angry or upset.

468
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,260
She's a good mother.

469
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,230
She raised Shaoheng all by herself.

470
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,190
Shaoheng may look frivolous,

471
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,960
but he has a kind heart.

472
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,820
The fact that he's become such a person

473
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,150
is all thanks to Mrs. Qi's good parenting.

474
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,840
How could I blame a mother

475
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,320
who only wants to protect her son?

476
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,730
The way you speak of Mrs. Qi—

477
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,750
if she were in danger one day,

478
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,720
would you take a stab for her?

479
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,350
Yes.

480
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,150
What did you say?

481
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,460
I'm willing to give my life

482
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,720
to protect her.

483
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,790
Because she's the mother
of the man I love.

484
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,150
If anything happened to her,

485
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,080
Shaoheng would be devastated.

486
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,610
If Shaoheng is sad,

487
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:57,920
I would be unhappy too.

488
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,960
I know it's wrong

489
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,830
to lie.

490
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,280
But I don't know what else to do.

491
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,850
I can't just watch two people in love

492
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:06,850
be kept apart.

493
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,780
Lu, I have an idea.

494
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,540
Why do I feel...

495
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,210
it's not a good idea?

496
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,290
Mother!

497
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,480
Stop!

498
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,870
Lu, do you understand?

499
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,550
I need someone to pretend to be a bandit

500
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,410
and ambush Mrs. Qi on her way.

501
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,260
At that moment, Luan'er
will show up to save her!

502
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,890
A beauty saves her future mother-in-law.

503
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,820
It's a perfect way to win her favor.

504
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,080
Do you understand?

505
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,340
Pretend to be a bandit?

506
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:44,690
I...

507
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,690
Don't I have any dignity?

508
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,200
I have no one else to ask.

509
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:51,920
I can't

510
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,180
ask my brother who's a constable, right?

511
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,190
Let me think about it.

512
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,410
But I will help you.

513
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,260
Thank you, Lu.

514
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,470
I knew

515
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,400
you would help me.

516
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,580
But...

517
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,040
this plan is another deception.

518
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,700
Aren't you worried...

519
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,730
Luan'er, let me ask you again.

520
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,170
Are you truly willing
to take a stab for Mrs. Qi?

521
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,640
Yes.

522
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,040
I am willing too.

523
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,400
The Qi family has let us
use their land rent-free for years.

524
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:36,310
That's why we've been able
to run our tea stall and making a living.

525
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,280
Even if it costs us our lives,

526
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,110
we must repay their kindness.

527
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,370
Lu, look at them.

528
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,260
They are very sincere.

529
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,880
Where is dishonesty in that?

530
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,560
Last time, I did it only for my parents,

531
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,050
but this time, it's different.

532
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,910
If we can't move Mrs. Qi this time,

533
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,600
they'll never be able to marry each other.

534
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,650
I... I can help you find some porters,

535
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:02,590
but...

536
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,160
Really?

537
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,060
How should I thank you?

538
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,420
But you need to promise me one thing.

539
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,330
What is it? I'll do it right away.

540
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,430
I haven't decided yet.

541
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,970
I'll let you know when I do.

542
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:17,750
It's fine.

543
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,480
I'll agree to whatever you ask.

544
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,030
Okay.

545
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,100
As for pretending to be a bandit,

546
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,730
you can leave it to me.

547
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,840
That's a promise.

548
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,640
We've got the bandit.

549
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,900
But... now we just need Mrs. Qi.

550
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,280
How do I lure Mrs. Qi out?

551
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,720
Alright, I got it.

552
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,720
I'll go to Qi Shaoheng

553
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,850
and have him think of a way

554
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:49,930
to lure Mrs. Qi out.

555
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,600
Thank you, Lu.

556
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,510
Mother, open the door!

557
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,240
Mother, let me out!

558
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,100
You stay in your room.

559
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,750
You are not allowed to see that tea girl.

560
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,270
Mother, what have I done wrong?

561
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,750
You've always taught me to be responsible.

562
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,750
I love Luan'er,

563
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,880
and she loves me too.

564
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,230
I want to marry her. Is that wrong?

565
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,740
She's vain.

566
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,550
She even conspired with Shi Fa'ke
to impersonate a noble lady.

567
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,750
Haven't I told you before?

568
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,880
I detest dishonest people most!

569
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:21,530
Mother. Mother!

570
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,290
It was not what you think!

571
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,410
Who's outside?

572
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,830
Mr. Qi,

573
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,400
if you truly wish to marry Liu Luan'er,

574
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,300
tomorrow, take your mother

575
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,700
to pray at Mount Jiugong.

576
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,870
Lu Chi?

577
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,090
What trick are you playing now?

578
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,330
Just do as I said.

579
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,620
I can safeguard both the Qi family legacy

580
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,300
and your marriage to Luan'er.

581
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,360
Why should I believe you?

582
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,900
I simply holds grudges against those

583
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,770
who smuggled government grain.

584
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,280
And you are incredibly lucky.

585
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,970
You're Shi Fa'ke's client.

586
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,410
You've cried and made a scene.

587
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,820
All that's left is the trump card—
hanging yourself.

588
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,830
Why don't you take your mother

589
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,680
to pray at Mount Jiugong tomorrow?

590
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,810
There might still be a glimmer of hope.

591
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,510
Fine. I'll trust you one last time.

592
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:33,000
Tomorrow, I'll find a way
to take my mother to pray there.

593
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:33,710
Lu Chi.

594
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,390
Don't forget what you promised.

595
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,770
Then it's a deal.

596
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,610
So this is Lu Chi's plan?

597
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,650
This is quite a spectacle.

598
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,390
Qi Shaoheng, prepare to die!

599
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,040
Ke, maybe we should go back.

600
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:46,000
I still feel it's not proper to do this.

601
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,660
We can't. It's too late now.

602
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,810
So many people?

603
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,360
It's just an act.

604
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,310
Why did Lu hire so many men?

605
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,770
This is quite a spectacle.

606
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,500
Where is Lu?

607
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,140
This doesn't look like an act.

608
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,190
Oh no!

609
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,960
Shaoheng and Mrs. Qi are in danger!

610
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,810
Luan'er!

611
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,060
Luan'er!

612
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,030
Stay away!

613
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,300
This looks way too real.

614
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,970
They're actually fighting for real! Run!

615
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,370
Go away! Go away!

616
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,160
Lu, save me!

617
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,200
Lu!

618
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,920
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

619
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,230
I think they really want to kill us.

620
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,680
Are you okay?

621
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,750
I'll leave the rest to you.

622
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:36,390
Remember to protect the Qi family.

623
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,400
Yes.

624
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,330
Blood.

625
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,550
Fortunately, it's just a flesh wound.

626
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,240
Mrs. Qi!

627
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:05,970
Shaoheng.

628
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,139
Mrs. Qi, go help Shaoheng!

629
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,550
Mother.

630
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,900
Luan'er, are you alright?

631
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,350
-I'm fine.
-Help her up.

632
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,880
Just a few women and young men

633
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,210
were able to defeat my best men.

634
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,380
Tell me,

635
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,780
are my men too incompetent?

636
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,400
Or does Qi Shaoheng
have supernatural power?

637
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,530
I'm incompetent.

638
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,100
I deserve to die.

639
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,920
It was all because of Shi Fa'ke.

640
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,199
A man with exceptional martial skills

641
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,960
suddenly appeared by her side.

642
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,590
A man with exceptional martial skills?

643
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,679
Who is this person?

644
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:53,040
I've already sent men to investigate.

645
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,810
At this point,

646
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:59,100
perhaps the Qi family
and Shi family should be...

647
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,480
Idiot.

648
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,320
You're a damn idiot.

649
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,020
You already failed once.

650
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,560
They're on alert now.

651
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,520
It'll be harder next time.

652
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,410
At this point,

653
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,710
if Qi Shaoheng or Tao suddenly dies,

654
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,520
everyone will know

655
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,460
someone else is behind it.

656
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,630
And it might draw attention of that one.

657
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,140
Got it.

658
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,360
You idiot.

659
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:25,360
I ordered you to win over the Qi family
through marriage. You failed.

660
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,410
I ordered you to take Qi Shaoheng's life.

661
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,410
You failed too.

662
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,210
What's the use of keeping you?

663
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,380
I deserve to die. I deserve to die.

664
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:33,620
Luckily,

665
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,770
Ms. Deng has become the Chief Matchmaker.

666
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:40,090
The spouses and relatives
of all officials in the capital

667
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:42,190
are essentially within my grasp.

668
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,280
When the time comes,
we'll form alliances through marriage.

669
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,590
That will be of great help to me.

670
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,280
Ke, it's alright now.

671
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,110
I'm here with you.

672
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,470
Come in.

673
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,710
Chief, this is calming medicine.

674
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,980
When Miss Shi wakes up,

675
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:29,070
have her take this.

676
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,190
Got it. You may leave.

677
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,470
Chief, your wound...

678
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,990
It's nothing. Prepare a new outfit for me.

679
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,230
Yes.

680
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,280
Little boy.

681
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,190
Little boy.

682
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,430
Little boy!

683
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,960
Ke, you recognize me?

684
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,100
Lu,

685
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,820
of course I recognize you.

686
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,280
You're Lu.

687
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,660
You should take your medicine first.

688
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,250
Lu,

689
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,890
are you hurt?

690
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:04,620
I have great martial skills.

691
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,150
Who could possibly hurt me?

692
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,110
Lie down and get some rest.

693
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:10,820
But I saw blood.

694
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,010
I'm really not injured.

695
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,540
It must've been the bandit's blood

696
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,940
that stained my clothes.

697
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,370
I've already changed out of them.

698
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:21,110
Look.

699
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:22,880
I'm fine.

700
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:30,950
Thank goodness.

701
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,650
When Miss Shi wakes up,

702
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:39,430
don't mention anything about my injury,

703
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,520
so as not to frighten her again.

704
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:43,880
Yes.

705
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:45,930
But...

706
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,250
Master,

707
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:49,190
you're seriously wounded.

708
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:51,070
-Should I get a doctor for...
-I'm fine.

709
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,130
Just a minor wound.

710
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,870
Just bring me some
of our special wound-healing powder.

711
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,540
I need to take care of Ke later.

712
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:00,880
By the way,

713
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:03,520
go to He's Mansion and tell them

714
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,330
Xibao Pavilion
released new products today,

715
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,460
and Ke will return after a short while.

716
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:09,760
Yes.

717
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,820
Lu, I've been out for a long time.

718
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,640
Don't worry.

719
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,930
I've asked Ms. Li to tell the He family

720
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,410
you'll stay longer at Xibao Pavilion.

721
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:49,470
Get some more rest.

722
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,100
I need to go out for a while.

723
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,820
Lu, you must be tired too.

724
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,500
You should go back and rest.

725
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,460
I should leave after a while.

726
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:17,930
Why is there blood?

727
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,870
This is strange. I'm not injured.

728
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:27,480
Could it be... Lu's?

729
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:31,210
Why didn't he say anything about it?

730
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,170
Miss Shi, you're awake.

731
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,980
A wound-healing powder?

732
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:56,520
Lu is injured, right?

733
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,600
Miss, Mr. Lu specially told me

734
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:02,670
that you faint at the sight of blood.

735
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,130
He didn't want you to know.

736
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:06,490
Please don't tell him I spilt the beans.

737
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,330
Don't let his kindness be in vain.

738
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,730
Don't worry.

739
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:20,300
Go back and rest a bit more.

740
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,340
I'm going to deliver the powder.

741
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,180
Lu got hurt while saving me.

742
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:32,830
He truly is a good person.

743
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,810
But how should I repay him?
