00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,460
Young Master,

7
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,880
your room payment is due.

8
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,840
Please wait a moment.

9
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,520
Sir, please bear with me
for a few more days.

10
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,430
I'll find a way soon.

11
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,230
Please do so as soon as possible.

12
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,640
Mr. Yan, look!

13
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,040
This is so beautiful.

14
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,630
It'll look great on you.

15
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,310
Boss,

16
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:32,260
please pack this one,
this one, and this one

17
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:32,820
for me.

18
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,560
Sure.

19
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,520
What's wrong?

20
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,520
Why the long face all day?

21
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,329
Something troubling you?

22
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,050
Ke.

23
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,810
Could you lend me some money?

24
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,500
I left in such a hurry,

25
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,360
and there's so much to eat and see here
in the capital.

26
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,900
I spent all my travel money
without even realizing it.

27
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,100
That's it?

28
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,170
No problem.

29
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,400
However,

30
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,640
this is all I have left today.

31
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,770
Take it for now.

00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,210
Thank you, Ke.

34
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,140
It's just that after all this time,

35
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,850
there's still no sign of Mr. Lin Yuan.

36
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,500
Searching like this is like
looking for a needle in a haystack,

37
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,560
and I don't know how long it will take.

38
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,710
Everything in the capital costs money -
food, clothes, lodging, transportation.

39
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,120
I don't know how long
this money will last.

40
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,390
That's easy.

41
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,100
Just check out of the inn

42
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,070
and come stay at my place.

43
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,130
That would save you a lot of expenses.

44
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,160
Ke, you're truly saving me from disaster.

45
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,020
I will do everything in my power to repay

46
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,020
the kindness you've shown me today.

47
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,240
But...

48
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,329
Is there a problem?

49
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,540
There is indeed an unresolved issue.

50
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,470
You're dressed as a man now,

51
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,900
and I'm still unmarried.

52
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,050
If I

53
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:50,340
bring a strange man home to stay,

54
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,010
my brothers and father
would tear the roof off.

55
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,150
Besides,

56
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,750
if Brother Lu finds out

57
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,050
I brought a man home,

58
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,440
I don't know what he would think.

59
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,380
So that's what you're worried about.

60
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,980
That's easy to fix. Let's go.

in this outfit.

It's fine now, right?

65
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,250
Of course it is.

Nice to meet you, Miss Qiyue.

80
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,480
So you're Cousin's friend.

81
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,170
Miss Qiyue, you're so pretty.

Greetings Eldest Brother, Second Brother,

83

and hello to you, Qin'er.

84

Where are you from, Miss Qiyue?

85
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,880
I'm from out of town.

86
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,010
From out of town.

87

88

She has no relatives here.

89
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,410
I didn't feel at ease

90
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,560
letting such a pretty girl

91
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,760

Mother.

93
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,010
Could she stay with us for a few days?

94
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,590
Since she's your friend,

95
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,810
she's certainly welcome in our home.

96
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,550
I'll tell the servants

97
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,560
to tidy up the room in the east wing.

98
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,860
You can stay there.

99
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,950
It's close to Ke's room,

Sorry for imposing on you.

It's no trouble.

104
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,290
Just treat this as your own home.

105
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,240
Besides Ke,

106
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,270
you can also ask these two for help
if you need anything.

107

Feel free to come to us for anything.

Miss Shi didn't meet Mr. Yan today.

120

But, she brought

121

Why are you telling me

about this?

130
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,290
What does it have to do with me?

131
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,470
It doesn't have anything to do with you?

132
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,360
That young lady is getting close

133
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,940
with the whole Shi family.

134
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,520
Does it really have nothing
to do with you?

135
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,190
These new fabrics that just arrived
are all pretty good in quality.

136
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,630
Sort them out later

137
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,710
and put them away.

138
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,560
Okay.

This is rouge, right?

Which one sells the best?

150
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,800
This one
is more popular among young ladies.

151
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,950
Good, Miss Qiyue will definitely like it.

152
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,360
Wrap it up.

What else do young ladies like?

Miss Qiyue will definitely like it.

163

Who told you to put this here?

164
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,900
Does it look good here?

165
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,630
In the future, do not do things
I didn't order you to do.

166

Sister Pan'er, why are you upset?

Is something bothering you lately?

quite a bit of weight recently.

Are you two dieting together?

Pan'er, are things with my Eldest Brother
going well lately?

175

Well? Not at all!

His heart isn't with me at all.

177
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:01,790
That's impossible.

178

My brother isn't like that.

179
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,940
Sister Pan'er, don't worry.

180
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,480
Leave it to me.

181
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,660
I'll figure something out.

182

You're overthinking it.

411

Ms. Fang has always been very concerned
about everyone's matchmaking cases.

412

Ms. Fang seems to be paying
extra attention to Qiyue.

413

It's really puzzling.

414

Recently, Ms. Fang has been frequently
visiting Marquis Wu'an's Mansion.

Lu Chi's real identity.

He is the Master of Mount Qianya.

552
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:36,470
Everyone heard that, right?

553
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,030
He admitted it was a bank note.

554
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,880
Somehow, it turned into
blank paper in my hands.

555
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,120
I don't care, give me back my bank note!

556
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,270
How could it turn into blank paper?

557
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,600
Return my bank note now!

558
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,640
Is this some kind of magic trick?

559
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,000
Heaven help me.

560
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,120
The bank note

561
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,830
was meant to save

562
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,330
my 80-year-old mother!

563
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,720
How could I possibly use this money

564
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,090
to scam people?

565
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,000
Young Master,

566
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,000
if you really took his bank note,

567
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,480
just return it to him.

568
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,440
I said I didn't take it, so I didn't.

569
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,070
Let's go see a magistrate now,

570
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,600
and settle this in court.

571
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,280
Let's go.

572
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,980
What are you doing?

573
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,080
I won't go!

574
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,250
I-I-I won't go!

575
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,120
Common people like me,

576
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,790
with on power or influence,

577
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,490
if I go in,

578
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,920
will I ever come out?

579
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,740
My poor 80-year-old mother.

580
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,580
Mother, your child has failed you!

581
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,730
I don't have money for your treatment.

582
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,830
Alright.

583
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,530
If your mother is truly ill,

584
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,530
take this money for now.

585
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,440
Wait.

586
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,510
Do you remember which bank

587
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,750
issued the note?

588
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,470
It was Jiaotai Bank.

589
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,730
Good that you remember.

590
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:49,830
Now, let's go to the magistrate's office
together

591
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,160
to seek justice for you,

592
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,450
and then visit the bank to investigate.

593
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,440
I-I-I was mistaken,

594
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,600
it was from an out-of-town bank.

595
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,360
No matter which bank it's from,

596
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,750
going to the authorities
is the most appropriate action.

597
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,650
An ordinary person with a bank note

598
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:05,750
would treasure it dearly,

599
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,610
yet somehow you

600
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:09,240
can't even remember which bank issued it,

601
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,640
and you're afraid to go to
the authorities.

602
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,440
You must have something to hide.

603
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:22,990
Everyone, look here.

[Inn]

605
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,240
There's a hidden layer
in this blank paper.

606
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,880
The bank note was drawn on it.

607
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:30,010
How could you do this at such a young age?

608
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:38,600
Do you know the punishment for
forging documents?

609
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,540
Give it back.

610
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,830
You'll pay for this!

611
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,430

Thank you for your help, Miss.

My surname is Huang.

615
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,360
May I ask your name, Miss?

616
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,650
You're too kind, Mr. Huang.

617
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:55,710
I am Yan Qiyue.

618
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,100
It's not easy being away from home.

619
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,220
That person was really too rude.

620
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,550
I couldn't stand by and watch,
so I helped.

621
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,830
Put your money away.

622
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,920
This matter is settled.

623
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,950
I'll take my leave now.

625
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,570
Miss Qiyue.

00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,290
Forgive my boldness,

627
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,260
but I'd like to invite you
for a meal

628
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:22,490
to show my gratitude.

629
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:23,820
I just couldn't stand the injustice.

630
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,080
You don't need to be so polite, Mr. Huang.

631
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,070
No.

632
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,440
I'm truly grateful for your help today.

Alright, let's be friends.

00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,520
Then may I invite you

636
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,490
to dine at Xibao Pavilion?

637
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,400
No wonder someone tried to extort him.

638
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,060
He's really a fool with money.

639
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,620
Doesn't he know how much it costs

640
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,050
to eat at Xibao Pavilion?

641
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,790
Never mind, just follow me.

Boss, two bowls of beef noodles, please.

Alright, please wait a moment.

647
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,830
The beef noodles here
are tender and smooth.

00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,690
They melt in your mouth,

You can't find anything like this
anywhere else.

I offered to take her to Xibao Pavilion,

651
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:17,340
but she brought me
to this small stall instead,

652
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,440
and she seems so familiar with this place.

653
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,830
Seems she's a frugal girl

654
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,230
from an ordinary family.

Not really.

Actually, if something's bothering you,

670
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,520
you can talk to me about it.

671
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,650

you can't help me.

The person I like

682
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,350
is like

683
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,120
a fleeting dream to me.

684
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,840
I've never met him,

685
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,740
don't even know where he is,

686
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,880
but I just like him.

This feeling

688
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,680
must be hard to understand, right?

689
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,070
I understand.

690
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,409
Actually, the feeling of liking someone

691
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:13,190
is probably the same for everyone.

692
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,199

693
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,060
as long as you try your best to pursue it,

694
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,120
even if it doesn't work out in the end,

695
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,920
you won't have any regrets.

696
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,300
That makes sense.

What's so enviable about escorting
a princess to marriage?

731
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,450
Did they ever
ask for the princess's opinion?

732
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,910
A princess is a person too.

733
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:28,550
Why can't she marry someone
she truly loves?

It's nothing.

Are you hurt?

No.

924

It's fine.

926

Are you really okay?

927
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,920

If it weren't for you,

937

I don't know what
would have happened to Ketian.

938
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,150
-Kexian's shop...
-Ke, don't be so polite.
