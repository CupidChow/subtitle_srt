[Episode 8]

3
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,270
Lu,

4
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,570
Li Ang came prepared.

5
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,160
The tea-spilling plan failed.

6
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,470
Ms. Deng will deliver
the Information Card tomorrow.

7
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,470
What should we do?

8
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,410
Don't worry, Ke.

9
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,870
You go stop Miss Shen

10
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:00,950
and bring her back to watch the show.

11
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,810
This time, I'll handle it myself.

12
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,180
I promise it'll work.

13
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:09,340
Lu.

14
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,720
Be careful.

15
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,880
Don't take unnecessary risks.

16
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,880
She's Miss Shen, right?

17
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,870
Miss Shen.

18
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,180
I...

19
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,990
Tongyun, don't feel pressured.

20
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,630
I just don't want you
to end up with the wrong person.

21
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,070
Rumors say General Li is quite...

22
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,730
Perhaps someone spread the rumors
out of jealousy.

23
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,120
As long as he's not a bad person,
that's enough.

24
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,190
Tongyun, be careful on your way.

25
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,670
I'm leaving.

26
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,270
Miss Shen, wait.

27
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,120
I have something to tell you.

28
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,190
What else do you want to say? Go ahead.

29
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,810
General Li is violent and cruel
and kills innocent people.

30
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,810
You truly haven't heard
even a whisper of such things?

31
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,910
Miss Shi,

32
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:09,750
I thought you were someone

33
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,750
who could see beyond common prejudice

34
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,430
and wouldn't blindly believe rumors.

35
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,360
I never expected

36
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,400
you'd be just like the rest.

37
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,940
In the capital,

38
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,290
rumors about me being boy-crazy
are everywhere.

39
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,020
I know better than anyone

40
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,560
what it feels like
to live under a storm of rumors.

41
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,690
I only trust what I see with my own eyes.

42
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,040
You trust what you see with your own eyes.

43
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,440
I have no issue with that.

44
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,490
If he truly has a gentle nature,

45
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,890
he should be consistent.

46
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,370
Why don't you go back with me

47
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,829
to see for yourself again?

48
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,360
If he really is a good man,

49
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,930
I'll give up the idea
of finding someone else for you.

50
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:48,620
Fine, I'll go back with you

51
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,850
so that you can give up your idea.

52
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,680
Damn woman!

53
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,150
How did Shen Tongyun know
such a lowly, penniless scholar?

54
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:57,980
What right does he have

55
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,710
to enter my private room and sit here

56
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,640
drinking tea and chatting with me?

57
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,840
Yes.

58
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,830
General, please don't be angry.

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,910
Wang Ren

60
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,360
was brought here by Shi Fa'ke

61
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,290
to disgust you on purpose.

62
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,150
Fortunately,

63
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,590
I knew
Shi Fa'ke wouldn't give up so easily

64
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,990
and discussed countermeasures with you.

65
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,070
But honestly,

66
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,519
you handled the situation today

67
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,410
with such ease and composure.

68
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,270
If it were any other time,

69
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,870
I would've chopped them up
and fed them to dogs!

70
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,100
General Li.

71
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,970
General Li, please calm down.

72
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,030
Calm down.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,670
There's no need to be upset.

74
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,159
Once Shen Tongyun becomes your wife,

75
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,550
when you're not happy,

76
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,710
you can scold or beat her as you like,
right?

77
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,790
General Li, listen to me.

78
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,870
A little impatience spoils great plans.

79
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,100
Once this is done,

80
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,690
if you're not satisfied,

81
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,190
leave it to me.

82
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,890
I'll find you another beautiful wife.

83
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,120
What do you say?

84
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,860
Calm down, General.

85
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,450
You had just left, and he already
started saying harsh words,

86
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,520
talking about marrying someone else.

87
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,010
I'm afraid after you marry him,

88
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,340
he won't treat you well.

89
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,100
Miss Shen, can't you see?

90
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:14,980
Lu Chi?

91
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,300
Who are you?

92
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,360
Why did you barge into my private room?

93
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,430
I am Lu Chi,

94
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,580
the new owner of this restaurant.

95
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,730
I heard my staff member was clumsy

96
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,550
and stained your robe.

97
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,950
I've specially prepared
the most famous soup noodles

98
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,150
from the snack street

99
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,320
to apologize to you.

100
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,320
I hope you can forgive us.

101
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,940
You...

102
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,710
You're asking for death!

103
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,690
Stop!

104
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,760
General Li!

105
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,050
Come quickly. Hurry.

106
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,640
Shen Tongyun,

107
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,920
are you here to die too?

108
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,520
He's way too hot-tempered.

109
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,920
Yes, quite frightening.

110
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,980
Miss Shen, you've seen it yourself.

111
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,830
It's time to decide whether you want

112
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,680
to marry someone like him or not.

113
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,530
General Li is talented and imposing.

114
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,670
But I'm unpredictable.

115
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,890
I dare not aspire to such a match.

116
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,620
Let's call off our engagement.

117
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,540
Everyone here can bear witness:

118
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,880
I know I'm not worthy of General Li,

119
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,020
so I'm calling off the engagement.

120
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,290
Don't, Miss Shen.

121
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,930
Don't be deceived by Shi Fa'ke.

122
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,320
This is a scheme
devised by Shi Fa'ke and Lu Chi

123
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,090
to frame General Li.

124
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,890
Yes, I planned it.

125
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,240
But I only did this

126
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,860
because someone else lied first.

127
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,730
So I wanted to make him
show his true colors.

128
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,550
Ms. Deng,

129
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,550
you deceived Miss Shen too.

130
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:09,950
I...

131
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,700
You told General Li
to pretend to be gentle

132
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,170
and hide his violent nature,

133
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,510
tricking Miss Shen

134
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,240
into marrying such a dangerous man.

135
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,440
It's marriage fraud!

136
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,310
You...

137
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,200
Fine!

138
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,220
Everyone says you're fickle

139
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,460
and immoral.

140
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,190
I never intended to marry you anyway!

141
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,870
General Li! General Li!

142
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,150
It scared me to death.

143
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,730
Lu, are you alright?

144
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,770
I'm fine, Ke.

145
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,850
Don't worry.

146
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,270
I told you, as long as I'm here,

147
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,470
I promise it'll work.

148
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,940
Miss Shen, don't worry.

149
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,270
I will find you another good husband.

150
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,980
I won't force fate again.

151
00:07:58,990 --> 00:07:59,790
Lu,

152
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,980
Scholar Wang is right next door
at the painting shop.

153
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,040
Why don't we strike while the iron is hot

154
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,500
and think of another plan?

155
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,150
Okay.

156
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,300
Don't follow me.

Did you see that?

General Li!

162
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,390
That boy-crazy Shen Tongyun was leaning
over there.

163
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,150
Who knows what she was looking at?

164
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,890
Looking at men of course.

165
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,450
She was so excited
that she nearly rushed out.

166
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,309
Shen Tongyun is so immoral.

167
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,659

What gives you the right to slander her
behind her back?

173
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,390
Has she fallen in love with your sons?

174
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,240
Is she going to marry into your families?

175
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,620
They are unmarried.

yet you're ruining her reputation
behind her back.

to say she's immoral?

Isn't inner beauty the true beauty?

with some embellishments.

324
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,230

00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,940
I just never expected

375
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,690
I would have the honor...

376
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,620
Tongyun,

377
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,330
I specially came today to propose to you.

378
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:30,940
If you accept me,

379
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,300
I promise I'll love and protect you
for a lifetime

380
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,040
and make you happy.

381
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,430
And if I don't accept you,

382
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,890
will you not give me this painting?

383
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,670
I will.

384
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,690
This painting was meant
to be a gift for your wedding.

385
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,020
If you agree to marry me,

386
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,900
this painting will be
part of the betrothal gifts.

387
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:56,990
If you...

388
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,570
If you find another good man,

389
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,980
this painting will be my gift
to celebrate your wedding.

390
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,310
Miss Shen,

391
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,720
Scholar Wang has loved you faithfully
for over a decade.

392
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,850
He's stood the test of time.

393
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,050
A good man like him should not be missed.

394
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,360
The Information Card...

395
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,420
[Information Card]

396
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,380
Yes, I'll exchange it right away.

397
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,810
Next is choosing the wedding date.

398
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:25,890
Both families should meet

399
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,090
and decide the wedding date.

400
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,220
No need for all that.

401
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,880
My father has long wished for me
to find a good husband.

402
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,010
Today, his wish has finally come true.

403
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,660
The wedding date is up to me.

404
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,530
Then Miss Shen, when?

405
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,570
Three days from now is an auspicious date.

406
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,300
Miss Shi, please help
make all the arrangements.

407
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,440
Three days from now?

408
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,210
Miss Shen, isn't that a bit too soon?

409
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,170
Not at all.

410
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,590
Um...
I've loved Tongyun for over 10 years.

411
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,200
This mustn't be delayed a moment longer.

412
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:58,520
Please grant our wish, Miss Shi.

414
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,100
Please grant our wish, Miss Shi.

415
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,160
Thank you, Miss Shi.

416
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,640
Go now.

417
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,770
Thank you, Miss Shi.

418
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,780
Ren, appreciate this painting with me.

419
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,310
-Tongyun, look here.
-Three days.

420
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:13,790
How remarkably creative.

[Shen's Mansion]

422
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,460
Ke, what's wrong?

423
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,130
Are you in trouble?

424
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,770
Or are you feeling unwell?

425
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,290
Why do my clients

426
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,940
either refuse to marry

427
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,970
or hurry to get married?

428
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,680
Now they're even more impatient.

429
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,540
They want a wedding in three days.

430
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,120
What am I supposed to do?

431
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,930
Don't worry.

432
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,660
You've got me.

433
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,370
You can't help me with this.

434
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,250
Only Kexian can help me.

435
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:51,980
[Shen's Mansion]

436
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,800
Wait.

437
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,830
I was not joking with you.

438
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,460
Before Shen Tongyun gets married,

439
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,230
you need to keep your distance.

440
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,230
You can't show up.

441
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,760
You're not keeping your distance.

442
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,760
Why should I?

443
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,100
What does it have to do with me?

444
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,140
Remember:

445
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,410
keep your distance.

446
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,470
Stop following me.

[Shen's Mansion]

448
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,890
Ketian,

449
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,590
if Shen Tongyun's wedding
can be held successfully,

450
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,070
apart from bringing honor
to the Shi family,

451
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,320
if we can prepare all the wedding cakes
within three days,

452
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,350
He's Bakery will also become famous
throughout the capital.

453
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,960
Don't even think about it.

454
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,950
Preparing over 1,000 wedding cakes
within three days

455
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,210
is simply impossible.

456
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,040
Don't reject me so quickly.

457
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,220
I'll pay you more.

458
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,080
You can hire more people to help.
How about that?

459
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,700
Kexian, please help me.

460
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,650
Stop daydreaming.

-My brother...
-I'll help you.

would be the saviors of me and Miss Shen.

467

Mr. He, don't push yourself too hard.

468
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,950
As your younger sister said,

469
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,310
making over 1,000 wedding cakes

470
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,070
within three days is simply impossible.

471
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,860
If I promise Ke something,

472
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,800
I will make sure it gets done.

473
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,380
But I wonder

474
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,450
what you can do to help Ke.

to help me write them?

Of course.

to make Miss Shen's wedding

483
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,780

If my two brothers see you,

501

you'll get beaten again.

502

I did something that deserves a beating.

503

If your brothers want to beat me,

get rid of Li Ang,
Scholar Wang's love rival.

510
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,510

Ke, you're not angry with me anymore?

512
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,170
Of course I was angry,

536
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,570
I don't know if he was pretending.

537
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,840

I'll tell Mother.

I've always worried
I haven't taken care of her well enough,

576

00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,280
So beautiful.

929
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,000
The second one is beautiful too.

930
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,570
Yes.

931
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:38,630
[Revelry of Peace]

932
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,050
Indeed.

933
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,450
[Revelry of Peace]

934
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:50,940
Truly beautiful.

935
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,690
It's not just her looks—

936
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,530
her dancing is so captivating too.

937
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:57,320
Yes.

938
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:57,800
Really impressive.

939
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,190
Lu, do you think this dancer is beautiful?

940
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,080
Come on. Cheers.

941
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,110
She is indeed beautiful.

942
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,490
Men are so shallow.

943
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:15,890
You're only attracted to pretty women.

944
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:20,350
Actually, I was just teasing you.

945
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,360
Her smile isn't as captivating as yours,

946
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:26,450
and there's no true emotion in her dance.

947
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,900
That's more like it.

948
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:32,610
These grapes are very sweet.

949
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:34,680
Have you heard?

950
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:34,760
[Revelry of Peace]

951
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,840
These days, nobles and high officials

952
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,480
have been flocking to Hua Yuerong's shows.

953
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,890
That's why all the evening shows
have been canceled.

954
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:43,160
We can only see her in the daytime.

955
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,920
That's right.

956
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,260
Especially Vice Commander Xu Ao.

957
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,270
I've seen him come a few times.

958
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,630
He always went
to the private room upstairs.

959
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:54,080
There must be something between them.

960
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,800
He's young and accomplished.

961
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,700
He is now at the peak of his career.

962
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,760
Of course he's in a good mood.

963
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,670
A man

964
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:02,680
unwinds a little at night—

965
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,520
nothing strange about that.

966
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,140
That makes sense.

967
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:09,330
Here, a toast to you.

968
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:15,800
Lu, let's go.

969
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,870
Don't listen to their nonsense.

970
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,120
She really is a great dancer.

971
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:28,510
Ke,

972
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:30,000
why are you angry?

973
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,110
Candied haws.

974
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,030
I just hate hearing people slander others
behind their backs.

975
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:35,710
I know that Xu Ao they were talking about.

976
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:37,460
My mother was the one
who arranged his marriage.

977
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:38,960
Though he has a humble background,

978
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,030
he is an upright person.

979
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:41,800
It is impossible to judge a man's heart
from his face.

980
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,010
It's been so long.

981
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:44,880
Perhaps he has really changed.

982
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,400
Impossible.

983
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,630
My mother has met all kinds of people.
Her judgment is impeccable.

984
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:50,190
She wouldn't be wrong about him.

985
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:53,120
Yes, Ms. Tao's eye for character
is unmatched.

986
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,620
Ke, don't bother with those people.

987
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,070
My mother was
the No.1 matchmaker in the world.

988
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,070
Everyone knows

989
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:00,820
the marriages she arranged
are all good ones.

990
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,150
They're all perfect matches.

991
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:04,780
By His Majesty's order, we're on our way
to deliver an imperial edict!

992
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:07,510
Vice Commander of the Imperial Cavalry,
Xu Ao, has been promoted!

993
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:09,700
All unrelated persons, out of the way!

994
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,670
By His Majesty's order, we're on our way
to deliver an imperial edict!

995
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:15,510
Vice Commander of the Imperial Cavalry,
Xu Ao, has been promoted!

996
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:17,640
All unrelated persons, out of the way!

997
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:19,760
What did I tell you?

998
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,510
Xu Ao has been promoted again.

999
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:23,900
Ms. Liu truly married the right man.

1000
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,220
All unrelated persons, out of the way!
