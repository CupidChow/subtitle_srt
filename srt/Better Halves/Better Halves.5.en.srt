[Weiyuan Escort Agency]

4
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,940
After what happened today,

5
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,750
I've come to
understand Luan'er's character.

6
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,430
Regarding your marriage...

7
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,039
Madam, it's not what you think.

8
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,680
I was out of my mind today

9
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,310
and hired someone to pose as a robber,

10
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,840
just to gain your approval.

11
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,520
But somehow,

12
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,850
my plan backfired

13
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,780
and nearly cost you
and Shaoheng your lives.

14
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,150
I know I've betrayed your trust.

15
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,240
I dare not mention
my marriage to Shaoheng anymore

16
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,690
I only ask for your forgiveness, Madam.

17
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:26,640
Come.

18
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,240
Luan'er, don't talk nonsense.

19
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,760
Those assassins today were ruthless.

20
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,100
They nearly took your life.

21
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,100
How could they possibly be hired by you?

22
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,560
Those four who escaped

23
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,090
were probably hired by her,

24
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,550
but those who tried
to kill us mother and son

25
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,570
have absolutely nothing to do with her.

26
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,579
Madam.

27
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,950
Shaoheng.

28
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,450
You insisted I go burn incense,

29
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,020
and things were strange all along the way.

30
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,510
I bet you had a hand in this too.

31
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,020
-Mother, I…
-Your mother is not old.

32
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,490
Luan'er is injured now,

33
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,460
and in the future,

34
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,180
she probably can't
carry water or brew tea.

35
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,010
I think we might as well
close the teahouse.

36
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,620
Mother, how can you say such things?

37
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,970
Luan'er was injured trying to save you...

38
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,450
This is all my own fault.

39
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,540
I blame no one else.

40
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,200
Please don't worry, Madam.

41
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,800
My son may be a bit of a scoundrel,

42
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,750
but he still has some conscience.

43
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:25,910
In the future,

44
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,780
if he dares to mistreat you,

45
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,240
I'll beat him for you.

46
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,220
Mother, you've agreed!

47
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,360
Hurry up and prepare the room.

48
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,230
Oh right, remember to find Shi Fa'ke.

49
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,550
You children,

50
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,200
conspiring together on such a rotten plan,

51
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,930
all just to get married, right?

52
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,430
Now everything is settled,

53
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,450
so the wedding

54
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,300

55
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,360
Thank you, Mother.

00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:01,970
Let go.

59
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,480
You're so clumsy.

60
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,330
I'll take care of Luan'er.

61
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,390
You go handle the important matters.

Lu, I...

63
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,959
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,839
Did I hurt you?

65
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,020
I don't know how to repay your kindness.

66
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,950
You already know?

67
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,270
If you want me to know, I'll know.

68
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,790
If you don't want me to know,

69
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,190
I'll pretend not to know.

70
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,270
But your kindness

71
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,020
will always remain in my heart.

72
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,100
I don't want to bestow favors.

73
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,560
It's better if you forget.

74
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,490
Anyway, you still have
one thing to promise me.

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,920
could you stop being all lovey-dovey here?

78
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,990
For saving your life,

79
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,390
you should repay him
by becoming his bride.

80
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,930
Qi Shaoheng, stop talking nonsense.

81
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,340
Miss Shi,

82
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,400
how am I talking nonsense?

83
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,890
You two, I'm getting married.

84
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,650
Doesn't it feel like a dream?

85
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,610
Miss Shi, shall I pinch you

86
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,040
so you can feel it's real?

87
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,320
No need.

88
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,770
It's fortunate that this incident

89
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,830
has led to your marriage with Luan'er,

90
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,740
which is truly a cause for celebration.

91
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,410
However, Lu,

92
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,450
didn't you just hire
some porters to put on an act?

93
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,220
Why would they try
to harm us in broad daylight?

94
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,240
The Qi family runs an escort agency,

95
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,980
so they're bound to have some enemies,

96
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,380
which isn't surprising.

97
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,230
I suppose so.

98
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,390
Anyway,

99
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,080
your marriage is settled now.

100
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,670
Mrs. Qi is very magnanimous,

101
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,750
not blaming us

102
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,150
and even approving your marriage.

103
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,310
Of course.

104
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,670
Thanks to Luan'er
who sacrificed herself to save my mother.

105
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,930
Of course, of course.

106
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,320
Miss Shi's brilliant plan

107
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,950
deserves a lot of credit too.

108
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,000
Don't mention it.

115
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,120
Then I'll trouble you, Miss Shi,

to arrange my wedding as soon as possible

117

with all the proper
betrothal gifts and ceremonies.

Our family

122
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,290

your family's silver or valuables.

still wrongfully imprisoned.

I know you're a victim,

125

and so are my parents.

126
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:38,840
Therefore,

127
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,340
I beg you to go to the Military
Headquarters and tell the truth,

128
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,270
so my parents can be released soon.

It's the right thing to do.

about Ms. Tao's character.

right now to plead your case,

Qi Shaoheng's match?

I don't care how you did it.

145

here out of old friendship,

you any more matchmaking cases.

Don't call me Ms. Deng.

Call me Chief Matchmaker Deng.

152

I am now the Chief Matchmaker
of the Official Matchmaking Agency.

153

won't assign me cases, so be it.

the Ms. Tao and the Shi father
and son will soon be released from prison.

says he's being
pressured to marry by court officials,

169
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,520
and has no mood to paint.

170

to keep an eye on Marquis Wu'an,

172

will definitely make his move
through the Official Matchmaking Agency.
