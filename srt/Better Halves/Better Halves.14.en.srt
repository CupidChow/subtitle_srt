-Mind your own business too.
-Give me a kiss,

00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,190
-Nowhere.
-Nowhere.

Wait.

383
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,690
So they're hiding something from me.

Kexian, why are you still up at this hour?

394
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,030
When have you ever come home this late?

395
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,280
I was worried when you were not home.

00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,510
I couldn't sleep.

397
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,260
You're the best, Kexian.

You'll get married someday.

If you marry Ke,

we can all live together.

Then we can play together every day.

Even if Ke moves in,

413
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,260
you'll have to move into the Shi family.

Kexian, what nonsense
are you talking about?

It's late. I'm going to bed.

It's fine that Xianxian
ate roast chicken alone,

but he also went to have plum syrup.

their own situations too.

Just you must avoid sweets before bed,

or you might suffer from insomnia.

471

I'll remember your wise advice.

472
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,430
I want to ask you for a favor.

00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,960
My younger brother Lu Zhuxi is in love
with someone.

You know Miss Zhu best.

How many betrothal gifts
should I prepare for Zhuxi?

479
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,440
Yanyan doesn't care about wealth.

480
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,130
What matters most is

481
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,770
that their hearts are aligned.

482
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,220
If their hearts truly speak as one,

483
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,160
and Mr. Lu shows his sincerity,

484
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,740
he'll win Yanyan's heart.

485
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:40,700
But the Zhu family is
the Prime Minister's household,

486
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,310
with high status and power.

487
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,770
So proper etiquette
must still be observed.

Lu.

489
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,000
This is a gift list I prepared.

490
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,650
Just prepare according to this.

Ms. Li.

492
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,730
Chief, what can I do for you?

493
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,890
This is the list
of betrothal gifts for Miss Zhu.

494
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,890
Prepare everything according to this list.

495
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:02,440
Yes.

496
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,920
Pan'er, please wait.

497
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,340
What do you think
of these betrothal gifts?

498
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:12,290
I don't know much about Miss Zhu,

499
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,880
so I don't really have an opinion.

500
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,100
I meant

501
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,630
what you think of betrothal gifts

502
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,590
for yourself.

503
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,390
I don't know. Don't ask me.

504
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,900
I have no thoughts on that.

505
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,640
If you don't know,

506
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,340
I'll ask Xianxian.

507
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,960
Seems like my guess is right.

508
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:40,860

Lu,
your younger brother is smooth-tongued.

Were you two discussing
something important?

517
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,800
It was for you.

518
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:09,880
For me?

519
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,380
That's a list

520
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,420
of betrothal gifts
for my future sister-in-law.

521
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,310
Really?

522
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,640
Brother, Sister-in-law,
you're so nice to me.

523
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,480
Mr. Lu.

524
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,070
I know you and Yanyan love each other.

525
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,200
But the Prime Minister's household is
different from ordinary ones.

526
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,550
The etiquette must be observed properly,
and betrothal gifts must be complete.

527
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,530
I know. Don't worry, Sister-in-law.

528
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,530
Sister-in-law, just call me Zhuxi.

529
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:32,910
Zhuxi,

530
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:35,310
I know what kind of person Yanyan is.

531
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,040
She doesn't care about money or status.

532
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,240
All she wants

533
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,190
is someone who understands her

534
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,850
and stays by her side forever.

535
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,940
So Zhuxi, can you promise me

536
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,590
that for the rest of your life,

537
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,050
you'll treat Yanyan well?

538
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:48,830
I can.

539
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:50,690
Not just in this life,

540
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,380
in the next life and the one after that,

541
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,240
I will always be with her.

542
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,910
Also, Yanyan loves reading novels,

543
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,810
especially Neighboring Hermit's novels.

544
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,610
Write more for her in the future.

545
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,650
Sister-in-law,

546
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,440
that won't be a problem.

547
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,860
Even if she wants me to write every day,

548
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,090
I would do so willingly.

549
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:07,830
That's good.

550
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,350
Once the betrothal gifts are ready,

551
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,880
we'll go propose marriage.

552
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,240
Thank you, Brother, Sister-in-law.

553
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,970
I won't disturb you anymore.

554
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:17,180
I'm leaving.

555
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:17,880

00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,920
I believe he

740
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,060
can surely pass your test.

741
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,070
[Zhu's Mansion]

742
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,610
Mr. Lu.

743
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,290
Mr. Lu.

744
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,390
Yanyan, I'm here.

745
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,440
Yanyan.

746
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,500
Mr. Lu, you finally came.

747
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,750
So you were waiting for me.

748
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,000
I brought you this.

749
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,330
I wrote new chapters

750
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,530
and specially brought them to you.

751
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:41,260
I was worried
you might be tired of the old novels.

752
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,180
Thank you.

753
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,900
I never imagined my long-cherished wish
would finally come true.

754
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,360
Yanyan, I...

755
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,610
I want to ask...

756
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:56,390
You want to ask about my feelings for you?

757
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,230
I told Miss Shi and my brother today

758
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,670
that I'll marry no one but you.

759
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,400
My feelings will never change.

760
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:09,080
Do you know how I feel about you?

761
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,690
I, Zhu Yanyan, in this life,

762
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,290
will marry only Lu Zhuxi.

763
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,280
This resolve will never change.

764
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,190
Ms. Zhao, calculate

765
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,670
how many successful matches
the Official Matchmaking Agency

766
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,880
made this month.

767
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,080
I've already done the math.

768
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,130
You closed 12 cases this month.

769
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,600
I closed three.

770
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,200
Everyone else closed at least one case.

771
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,150
Ke, you're really amazing.

772
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,550
You closed so many cases.

773
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,670
Thanks to your care and support,

774
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,320
I achieved such good results.

775
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,120
Ke, you're being too modest.

776
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,690
You've truly inherited Ms. Tao's skills.

777
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,700
Sooner or later, you'll take her place.

778
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,390
I think it's time to decide
who should be the Chief Matchmaker

779
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,880
of the Official Matchmaking Agency.

780
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,660
No, no, no.

781
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,180
Ms. Zhao, I never thought of that.

782
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,230
I just want to be a good matchmaker.

783
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:26,180
Since Chief Matchmaker Deng died,

784
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,070
things have been easier,

785
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,040
and we've been more positive.

786
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,470
This month,
everyone landed matchmaking cases.

787
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,550
No one was left without work.

788
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,230
Yes.

789
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:33,880
That's right.

790

Ke, you're awesome.

791
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,710
So impressive.

792
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:38,440
I'll work even harder in the future.

793
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,680
I also hope that you

794
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,450
can continue to guide me and support me.

more matchmaking cases together.

You've been coming home late recently.

I was worried,

822
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,260
so I wanted to close up
after you came back.

823
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,580
Then you wouldn't have to sneak in again.

Ke hasn't come here for a few days.

If she wouldn't come, you can go to her.

829
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:39,440
I'd better not. She's quite busy.

you can't let Lu Chi

with Lu Chi again.

Not "seems." She did.

we'd be happier than before?

00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:41,550
Why should we not see each other for days?
