00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,900
you've always been rough,

16
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,820
From now on,
you must learn to be considerate

17

I'll be a good husband too.

Xianxian, let me tell you.

23
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,590
A true man should be strong and dependable
out in the world,

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,350
but at home,

00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,800

Mr. Lin Yuan's painting style is free,

can't help but marvel at it.

113
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,670
Perhaps this is Mr. Lin Yuan's intention—

114
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,800
he hopes his works don't simply end up

115
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,610
sealed away in the homes of the noble,

116
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,210

you're so knowledgeable.

His spirit is as high as mountains
and as long as rivers.

121
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,040
When Mr. Lin Yuan paints,

122
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,700
he avoids dragging the brush.

123
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,010
He believes
dragging dulls the stroke's power,

124
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,640
makes the work feel restless,

125
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,440
and disturbs the viewer's mood.

Mr. Lu

127
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,980

Mr. Lin Yuan's thoughts so well.

00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,870
Mr. Lu,

129
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,450
are you also skilled
in calligraphy and painting?

130
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,120
Might I have the honor today

131
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,970

132
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,110
I just completed a piece earlier today.

Ke, Mr. Yan, I'd be honored
if you could offer your insights.

134
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,740
Then lead the way, Lu.

135
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,070
The handwriting... looks so familiar.

136
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,420
Mr. Lu,

137
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,190
is this the painting you just finished?

138
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:11,820
Yes.

139
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,580
Ke.

140
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,210
This is clearly
Mr. Lin Yuan's handwriting.

141
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,750
Impossible. Lu painted this.

142
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,260
The handwriting may look similar,

143
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,560
but there are still differences.

144
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,710
And this is better than Mr. Lin Yuan's.

145
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,290
Mr. Lu,

146
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,340
you're Mr. Lin Yuan, right?

147
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,090
No.

148
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,130
What makes you say that, Mr. Yan?

149
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,730
The handwriting in this painting

150
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,040
is identical

151
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,350
to Mr. Lin Yuan's.

152
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,900
I couldn't possibly be mistaken.

153
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,360
You are mistaken, Mr. Yan.

154
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,140
I am not Mr. Lin Yuan,

155
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,190
nor do I know him.

156
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,180
How could Lu be Mr. Lin Yuan?

157
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:13,980
Lu,

158
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,170
are you really not Mr. Lin Yuan?

159
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:16,870
Ke,

160
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,890
I am certainly not Mr. Lin Yuan.

161
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,150
Do you remember when we first met,

162
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,190
you were with me admiring

163
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,650
Mr. Lin Yuan's paintings?

164
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,260
Mr. Yan,

165
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,670
Lu said he's not Mr. Lin Yuan.

166
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,220
So he definitely isn't Mr. Lin Yuan.

167
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,650
Lu and I will help you find him.

168
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,340
You won't be able to find him.

169
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,740
Don't waste your energy.

170
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:41,690
How could we not find someone who exists?

171
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,289
Unless...

172
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:43,710
Unless you are Mr. Lin Yuan.

173
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,580
I'm not.

174
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,770
Why do you insist on finding Mr. Lin Yuan?

175
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,440
Because I want to marry him.

176
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,090
But...

177
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,080
Mr. Lin Yuan is a man.

178
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,000
Qiyue, why did you...

179
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:22,830
Ke.

180
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,150
Thank you for keeping my secret before.

181
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,030
I know true friends are hard to find.

182
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,510
Everything must begin with honesty.

183
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,350
So I had to reveal my identity.

184
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,680
But... but I'm really not Mr. Lin Yuan.

185
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,690
Qiyue,

186
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,750
let's go get changed first.

187
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,480
Lu, we'll talk another day.

188
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,530
Let's go.

Qiyue.

193
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,230
You go first.

194
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,280
Alright, I'll go first.

195
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,610
Qiyue,

196
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:12,470
do you really think

197
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,010
Lu is Mr. Lin Yuan?

198
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,970
I believe he is.

199
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,510
Qiyue, you think Lu is Mr. Lin Yuan

200
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,320
just because of one painting.

201
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,740
Isn't that too hasty?

202
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,290
Besides, for a master like Mr. Lin Yuan,

203
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,510
there're plenty of people
who copy his style.

204
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,170
You've only seen a few of his works,

205
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,000
and you don't know
what kind of person he is.

206
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,950
Ke, trust me.

207
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,460
He must be Mr. Lin Yuan.

208
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,980
You promised me before.

209
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,450
If I can find Mr. Lin Yuan,

210
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,190
that means we're destined to meet.

211
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,670
You said you would help me.

212
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:45,650
Right?

213
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,270
Qiyue, I did say that.

214
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,170
Ke, I know

215
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,920
Mr. Lu is the one you love.

216
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,230
But I've traveled so far to the capital

217
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,910
just to find Mr. Lin Yuan.

218
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,650
Before, he didn't know

someone has been quietly admiring him.

220
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,240
Now that he knows,

221
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,440
you should give him a chance to choose,

222
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,650
and give me a chance to fight for him.

00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,980

How about we take you out for a walk?

doesn't truly love Mr. Lin Yuan.

317

if you look closely,
the differences are obvious.

318
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,170
If she can't even notice that,

319
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,130
how can she claim to love him?

but you can't even tell

354
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,150
if these are originals or imitations.

355
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,370

my feelings for Mr. Lin Yuan this way,

360
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,160
that's not fair.

But your ideal match

364
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,170
should be one of a kind.

The person you love

366
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,480
should be genuine,

367

If you want to marry someone

370
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,430

00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:06,180
Are you sure
you love Mr. Lin Yuan himself,

373
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,930
not the version you've imagined?

374
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:14,940
Qiyue,

375
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,740
you've seen Lu many times,

376
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,000
but you've never had
any special feelings for him.

377
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,210
Do you really think

378
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,140
he's the same as the Mr. Lin Yuan

379
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,140
you've imagined?

380
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,820
Do you truly want to marry Lu Chi?

381
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,970
Indeed, I don't have any feelings for him.

382
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,960
But when you found out
he was Mr. Lin Yuan,

383
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,820
you said you wanted to marry Mr. Lin Yuan,

384
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,050

00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,540
Exactly, I want to marry Mr. Lin Yuan.

You don't even know this person.

387
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,740
And you've never spent time with him.

388

How can you be sure he's the one you love

389
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:51,640

392
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,460
Ke, what you said makes sense.

393
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,780
Perhaps I really should think

394
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,690
about what I truly want.

Master, is this true?

742
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,560
I didn't receive any news.

743
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,750
They already posted the notice
outside Xibao Pavilion.

744
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,710
This impostor is so brazen.

745
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,760
Calm down.

746
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,890

What do you plan to do?

748
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,030

Then we'll catch the person behind this

and find out what his real purpose is.

755

Everyone in the capital knows it.

I'm so excited.

Mr. Lin Yuan is holding an art exhibition.

766
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,230
I came all the way to the capital
to look for him.

767
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,770
It was worth it.

768
00:36:59,200 --> 00:36:59,800
Yes.

00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,580
Maybe this is what they say:

771
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,200
It seems that Mr. Lin Yuan and I

are truly fated to meet.

773
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:12,940
Yes, indeed.

Maybe I'll meet Mr. Lin Yuan there.

777
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,690
I should head back and get ready.

778
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,640

00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,060

reminds me of the days we trained together

878
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:39,860

like real brothers.

881
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:46,620
When my family was destroyed,
my foster father took me in.

882
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,960
He taught the three of us

883
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:49,740
to respect our master,
treat each other as brothers,

884
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,340
and always uphold
loyalty and righteousness.

to eliminate all obstacles.

892
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:08,030
You've always been good to me,

893
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:09,510
but these past years,

00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,120
you've truly endured much.

895
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,880
You lived in concealment at Mount Qianya.

896
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,280

bear the humiliation and wait.

898
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,490
we must eliminate
every last one of my uncle's men

to end this threat once and for all.

The rise and fall of the nation
concerns every citizen.

901
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:26,940
I'm duty-bound in this.

902
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:29,340
Besides, I didn't leave Mount Qianya

903
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,070
solely for official business.

904
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:33,260
Not solely for official business?

905
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,020
Why haven't I heard you mention it before?

906
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:36,870
What is it?

907
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,410
I came to the capital

908
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,530
also to find the little girl

909
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,960
who saved my life when I was a kid.

910
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,180
I remember now.

911
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:48,530
The little girl who gave you desserts

912
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,270
and the gold badge back then.

913
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,660
So, have you found her?

914
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,880
Do you need me to send more men to help?

915
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:57,160
No need for that.

916
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,910
I've already found her.

917
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,160
So you didn't leave Mount Qianya

918
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:05,900
just to help solve my problems.

919
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,070
You came for your little girl as well.

920
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,080
Tell me,

921
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:11,950
am I going to have a sister-in-law soon?

922
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:14,090
Alright, let's not talk about this now.

923
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:16,850
I heard you've been departing the palace
frequently these days.

924
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:18,560
Is it because
Marquis Wu'an has made new moves?
