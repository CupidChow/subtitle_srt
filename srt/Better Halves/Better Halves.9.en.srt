Forcing them to remain bound

209

00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,650
Let's go take a look over there too.

369
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,460
Mr. Shi, do you like my handkerchief?

370
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:44,170
Mr. Shi, you're so strong!

371
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,210
You made me twist my ankle.

372
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,540
I didn't touch you,

373
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,240
don't try to frame me.

374
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,270
You suddenly pulled my handkerchief

375
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,030
and stepped aside.

376
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,550
You...

377
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,360
Are you trying to tease me on purpose?

378
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,170
My reputation is at stake now.

379
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,170
Now I've twisted my ankle

380
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,110
and suffered your humiliation.

381
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,420
I'm going to your home right now

382
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,750
to have Chief Matchmaker Tao settle this.

383
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:05,510
Let's go then.

384
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,680
Li Pan'er,
what exactly are you trying to do?

385
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,140
Well, at the moment,

386
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,670
I can't walk properly.

387
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,200
But we have so much work
at Xibao Pavilion.

388
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,740
Mr. Shi, you must take responsibility.

389
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,710
As long as you don't
report this to my mother,

390
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,650
I am at your service.

391
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,349
Actually,

392
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,210
I'm not an unreasonable person.

393
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,460
Once my foot heals,

394
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,010
I won't trouble you anymore.

395
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,350
Let's go.

396
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,900
Move along, everyone.

397
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,530
Haven't you seen someone
helping others before?

398
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,330
Mr. Shi looks so tall and strong,

399
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,660
yet he's afraid of women.

400
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,240
I quit.

401
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,480
You beat me again.

402
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,200
Let's start over.

403
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,530
How about we start over?

404
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,950
Let's restart, okay?

405
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:56,490
Xianxian.

406
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,790
Weren't you supposed to keep an eye on Ke?

407
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,480
Ke hasn't returned,

408
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,540
so why are you back?

409
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,720
Xianxian, why aren't you saying anything?

410
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,110
I...

411
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,440
I can't explain it clearly.

412
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,440
It's all because of that young lady.

413
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,320
Son.

414
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,510
Which young lady?

415
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,000
We can have
your mother arrange the marriage.

416
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
This is good news!

417
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,050
Let Ke go.

418
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,070
Yes, Ke can go.

419
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,350
Which young lady is it?

420
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,410
If Mother hears I tangled with
Li Pan'er on the street,

421
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,810
not only am I finished,

422
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,470
but Li Pan'er's reputation
would be ruined too.

423
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,610
But Ke still needs to be watched over.

424
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,080
What should I do?

425
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,600
My life is so difficult.

426
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,060
So difficult!

427
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,640
Son, what's going on with you?

428
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,750
Which young lady has

429
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,140
cracked that stubborn skull of yours?

430
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,400
Tell me, which family?

431
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,150
I didn't,

432
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,680
I haven't,

433
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,640
don't talk nonsense.

434
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,160
What do you mean "nonsense"?

435
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,000
How dare you speak like that?

436
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,830
Is that how you talk to your father?

437
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,030
Xianxian, explain yourself properly.

438
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,130
Father, brother.

439
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,730
I...

440
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,590
I did flirt with her.

441
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,170
What? Flirt?

442
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,870
No.

443
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,310
That's not it.

444
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,350
It's Ms. Li who said I flirted with her.

445
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,510
It's nothing, nothing.

446
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,920
Ms. Li must have been instructed by Lu Chi

447
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,060
to say such things.

448
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:20,870
Isn't she actually coveting
my strong and mighty presence?

449
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,350
Son.

450
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,110
Do you have some misunderstanding

451
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,510
about what "strong and mighty" means?

452
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,550
Or perhaps Ms. Li's eyesight

453
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,540
is the problem?

454
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,100
What do you mean?

455
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,330
I mean,

456
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,860
how could she
possibly be interested in you?

457
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,090
That does make sense.

458
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,340
This color looks a bit better.

459
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,360
None of these seem quite right.

460
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,520
Pan'er,

461
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,390
what do you think I should give as a gift?

462
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,660
Miss Shi, don't worry,

463
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,860
our Chief

464
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,760
probably has it all planned out.

465
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:12,740
Pan'er.

466
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,100
What happy news have you heard

467
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,030
that makes you smile so brightly?

468
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,610
Was I smiling?

469
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,690
Maybe the honest guy
is just too interesting.

470
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,300
Honest guy?

471
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,500
Who are you talking about?

472
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,240
[Heaven Rewards the Diligent]

473
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,140
Mr. He.

474
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,210
Thank you.

475
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,030
Kexian.

476
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,630
Ke?

477
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,340
What are you doing here?

478
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,680
Ms. Li, I apologize for the intrusion.

479
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,370
It's fine.

480
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,610
Here are the desserts you ordered.

481
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,950
I'll leave you two to chat.

482
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,310
This way, please.

483
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,220
Kexian, you're just in time.

484
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,120
I'm going to meet Commander Xu Ao.

485
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,200
What do you think
I should bring as a gift?

486
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,720
Why don't you come back with me,

487
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,030
and we can pick out
some exquisite desserts.

488
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,240
Ketian isn't still angry with me, is she?

489
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,470
If I come back with you,

490
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,270
she won't throw me out, will she?

491
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,930
She's not angry anymore.

492
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,360
She's been talking about you every day.

493
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,040
But bringing food,

494
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,800
isn't that too ordinary?

495
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,150
How about this gift?

496
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,520
Lu, what kind of scroll is this?

497
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,160
No matter what kind of scroll it is,

498
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,690
Xu Ao is a military officer,

499
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,450
how could he be given
paintings and calligraphy?

500
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,640
This brushwork looks
very similar to Mr. Lin Yuan's style.

501
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,740
It just doesn't have a signature or seal.

502
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,700
But this piece

503
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,590
shows stronger
and more masterful brushwork

504
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,920
than his previous ones.

505
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,630
It might just be an imitation.

506
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,600
How can you give someone

507
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,240
a painting without a signature?

508
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,300
Kexian, you're mistaken about this.

509
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,410
Mr. Lin Yuan's works are worth a fortune.

510
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,210
And Xu Ao has just been promoted.

511
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,710
If I were to give him an authentic piece,

512
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,170
it might look like a bribe.

513
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,900
This imitation has good artistic concept

514
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,330
and excellent technique.

515
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,530
As a gift exchanged between friends,

516
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,480
it's tasteful

517
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,280
and doesn't violate any laws.

518
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,540
That's exactly right.

519
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,190
Kexian,

520
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:19,190
we need to attend
to some important matters.

521
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,450
We'll visit you and Ketian another time.

522
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,240
You can go now.

523
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,740
Take care of yourself.

524
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,880
Lu.

525
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:37,940
Do you think

526
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,690
Xu Ao is really like
what Liu Yingying described?

527
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,300
I dare not make assumptions,

528
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,190
but seeing is believing.

529
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,340
Let's go to Flower House
to meet Xu Ao first,

530
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,870
then we can make a decision.

531
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,530
[Flower House]

532
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,970
How is the divorce proceeding?

533
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,560
Rest assured, My Lord.

534
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,220
I've sent Tao's daughter
Shi Fa'ke to handle it.

535
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,400
It will be done soon.

536
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,320
You sent Shi Fa'ke to handle it?

537
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,480
You're letting personal grudges
interfere with important matters.

538
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,180
I...

539
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,520
All Ms. Deng wants is to tarnish

540
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,010
the name
of the No.1 matchmaker in the world.

541
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,970
She wants to succeed

542
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,110
while taking all the advantage.

543
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,620
Little does she know

544
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,450
that times and circumstances change.

545
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,650
I finally managed to force
Liu Yingying to initiate a divorce.

546
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:26,880
Ms. Deng, you've delayed

547
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,620
my sworn brother's important matter
due to your selfish interests.

548
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,670
If my sworn brother blames us for this,

549
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:33,800
neither of us can bear the consequences.

550
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,700
I wouldn't dare.

551
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,480
Tomorrow I'll personally
go to Xu Ao.

552
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,370
No need.

553
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,480
Give me the divorce agreement.

554
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,480
You may leave now.

555
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,750
I take my leave.

556
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,050
My Lady.

557
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,040
Ms. Deng is completely useless

558
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,400
and almost caused trouble for you.

559
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,300
The Lord Marquis is still
worried about Xu Ao's matter.

560
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,790
Tell him to rest assured.

561
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,300
Xu Ao hasn't come home recently.

562
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,770
He sleeps in my brothel every night.

563
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,610
It’s all under my control.

564
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,460
Men, as you know,

565
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,470
can't bear to part with their wives,

566
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,550
yet can't resist their pleasures outside.

567
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,000
Regarding the Lord Marquis's instructions,

568
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
please handle it with care, My Lady.

569
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,550
Get Xu Ao to sign
the divorce agreement as soon as possible,

570
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,950
then marry him yourself,

571
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,030
to ease the Lord Marquis's concerns.

572
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,070
Ask him to wait for my good news.

573
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,350
Lord Xu.

574
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,450
I've brought you some wine.

575
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,620
My Lord.

576
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,700
On the surface, I'm here for pleasure,

577
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,550
but no one else can know about this.

578
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,790
I'll go answer the door,

579
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,640
and you leave through the window.

580
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,210
Yes.

581
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,590
Ms. Hua, since you've brought wine,

582
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,920
please come in
and join me for a few drinks.

583
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:17,960
Lu,

584
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,290
let's go see what Xu Ao is doing.

585
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,520
Ke.

586
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,560
No matter what you see later,

587
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,490
don't act impulsively.

588
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,700
Don't worry,

589
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,350
I know how to handle social situations.

590
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,240
If he's just properly eating and drinking,

591
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,240
I won't do anything inappropriate.

592
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:34,840
Let's go.

593
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,780
Lord Xu, if you do as I suggested,

594
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,890
any woman

595
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,540
would be delighted.

596
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,400
Excellent.

597
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,040
As long as it makes her smile.

598
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,050
Lord Xu.

599
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,190
Miss Shi,

600
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,840
what brings you here?

601
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,080
And who is this?

602
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,180
I feel like I've seen him before.

603
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:08,960
Lord Xu.

604
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,520
My name is Lu Chi,

605
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,390
the Chief of Xibao Pavilion.

606
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:16,490
Are you two guests invited by Lord Xu?

607
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,950
This gift is to congratulate you
on your promotion.

608
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,680
My mother was your matchmaker.

609
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,960
I've come today
to discuss something important with you.

610
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,290
What important matter?

611
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,110
You didn't even close the door just now.

612
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:36,440
I heard most of
what was said from outside.

613
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,500
I originally wanted
to hear your explanation,

614
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,990
but seeing how intimate you two are,

615
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,920
I don't think it's necessary anymore.

616
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,750
I came today

617
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:45,650
to ask you to sign this divorce agreement.

618
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:46,910
[Divorce Agreement]

619
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,750
Miss Shi,

620
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,200
my relationship with Ms. Hua
is purely platonic,

621
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,350
please don't misunderstand.

622
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,550
Stop making excuses.

623
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,320
I will definitely
get justice for Yingying.

624
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,950
Sign this divorce agreement,

625
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,400
and you'll have nothing more
to do with Yingying.

626
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,660
There'll be a clean break for both of you.

627
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,560
[Divorce Agreement]

628
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:10,720
[Divorce Agreement]

629
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,680
I won't divorce her.

630
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:25,510
[Wife: Liu Yingying] [Husband: Xu Ao]

631
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,710
Every time you hand me

632
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,460
that divorce agreement, I'll tear it up.

633
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,000
You...

634
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,290
Things have already come to this.

635
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,920
Aren't you two leaving?

636
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,690
You two are in cahoots.

637
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,650
Xu Ao.

638
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,320
Don't think that tearing up
the divorce papers

639
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,650
will solve everything.

640
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,760
You're hanging around
with this Hua Yuerong,

641
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,240
clearly you're not a decent person either.

642
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,000
You've found someone new
but won't set Yingying free.

643
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,730
You're absolutely shameless!

644
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,700
Ms. Hua, show them out.

645
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:54,890
This way, please.

646
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,980
You...

647
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,570
Ke, let's go.

648
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,830
Dolls! Come take a look!

649
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,530
Ke, are you still upset?

650
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:25,650
But anyway,

651
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,830
have you thought about what will happen

652
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,430
to Ms. Liu after the divorce?

653
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,100
Originally, for my mother's reputation,

654
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,760
I didn't plan to break them up.

655
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,210
But now,

656
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,890
Xu Ao is having an affair,

657
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,890
I can't let Yingying
suffer in silence for life.

658
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,060
Besides, our state's laws

659
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,510
don't discriminate
against divorced women at all.

660
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,710
Remarrying after divorce

661
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,760
is quite common.

662
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,680
Yingying is beautiful
and has good temperament,

663
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,890
finding another good match
wouldn't be difficult.

664
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,490
Even if she doesn't remarry,

665
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,200
Yingying still has her dowry.

666
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,370
And if we take that scumbag's property,

667
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,030
she can still live a good life.

668
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,200
Do you trust my ability to read people?

669
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,210
What did you notice?

670
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,570
Ke.

671
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,750
Where has your usual keen observation

672
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,650
gone to?

673
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,960
Think carefully about what just happened.

674
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,160
I was so furious with Xu Ao
that I couldn't think straight.

675
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:21,960
Wait.

676
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:26,000
When Xu Ao was talking with Hua Yuerong,

677
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,480
the door was left open.

678
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:28,960
Could it be

679
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,430
that Hua Yuerong heard footsteps

680
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,350
and deliberately staged everything?

681
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,090
Very likely.

682
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:36,200
When Xu Ao asked Hua Yuerong
to see us out,

683
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,920
it was just like how you speak to Ms. Li,

684
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,820
though your tone is actually much kinder.

685
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,760
If Xu Ao truly had feelings for Ms. Hua,

686
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,270
he would treat her with constant care,

687
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,030
not the way he does now.

688
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,850
Could we have misjudged Xu Ao?

689
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,960
Is Hua Yuerong really
the one causing trouble?

690
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,840
It's possible.

691
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,130
So we should find out the truth

692
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,070
and give Xu Ao a chance to explain himself

693
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,680
before making any decisions.

694
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,210
We mustn't act on impulse

695
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,920
and break up a marriage.

696
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,000
Lu, you're absolutely right.

697
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:15,330
I was indeed too emotional just now.

698
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,780
Would you be willing

699
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:19,750
to help me uncover the truth

700
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,230
before making a judgment?

701
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,000
Of course.

702
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:23,600
Let's go.

703
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,240
Is he crazy?

704
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,460
Climbing over the wall
to get into his own home?

705
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,610
He might...

706
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,950
He climbed over the wall to get home,

707
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,550
then climbed back out again.

708
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,210
What on earth is he up to?

709
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,880
Perhaps he has some personal difficulty
he can't talk about.

710
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,000
I feel like he's just like
the cheating spouse

711
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,760
you often see in literature.

712
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,880
The more I watch him,
the more suspicious he seems.

713
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,740
Alright, let's follow him first.

714
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,510
Let's go.

715
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,430
Lu, please don't let go of me.

716
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,650
I don't want to lose my life

717
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,610
before we even discover the truth.

718
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,010
I won't let go,

719
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,720
but you must promise me something.

720
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,510
No matter what you see or hear later,

721
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,570
you must stay calm,

722
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,940
or our lives will be in danger.

723
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,550
I wouldn't get upset over some jerk,

724
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,970
just don't let go of me.

725
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:02,780
My Lord, have you delivered the rouge yet?

726
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:03,980
I've sent it

727
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,720
and left it on the dressing table
she uses frequently.

728
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,720
My Lord, you needn't worry too much.

729
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,380
Just do as I say,

730
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,970
and everything will work out fine.

731
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:48,760
Lu, they...

732
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,330
Don't worry, Ke,

733
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,350
he's just drunk.

734
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:11,100
Hua Yuerong, what are you
planning to do to Xu Ao?

735
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,230
Lord Xu and I
are merely drinking companions

736
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,160
with nothing improper between us.

737
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,000
Xu Ao is an imperial official

738
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,050
and a married man.

739
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,220
With your beauty,

740
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,760
you don't need to do this.

741
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,740
It's a long story.

742
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,280
Not telling you is for your own good.

743
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,340
Please go back, both of you.

744
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,650
Ms. Hua, you...

745
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,310
Ke,

746
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,490
let's go.

747
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,150
Pan'er,

748
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:47,090
do you have any better rouge in your shop?

749
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,130
Of course we do.

750
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,250
Wen.

751
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,300
Actually,

752
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,590
this is a sample

753
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,780
specially ordered by a customer.

754
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,440
There was only one box
of the actual product,

755
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,760
and the buyer picked it up yesterday.

756
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,210
Miss Shi, you can only have a look.

757
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,370
I'm afraid it's no longer available.

758
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,110
This color is beautiful.

759
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,929
Ms. Li,

760
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,590
you've been hiding such a nice item

761
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,850
and won't sell it to me.

762
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:24,909
I wonder who

763
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:27,260
specially ordered such beautiful rouge?

764
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,110
It was...

765
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,409
Xu Ao.

766
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:34,570
Commander Xu.

767
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,050
It's him?

768
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:42,889
He must have bought rouge

769
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,030
as a gift for that person.

770
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,860
[Xu's Mansion]

771
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,160
Madam, Miss Shi is here.

772
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,920
All of you, please leave first.

773
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,650
Yes.

774
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,290
What is this?

775
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,150
Yingying, look.

776
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:21,400
What is this?

777
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,900
Why is it on my dressing table?

778
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,380
What's going on?

779
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:34,740
Yingying,

780
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,360
if you want to know,
come with me and find out.

781
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,400
[Revelry of Peace]

782
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,050
Bravo!

783
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:41,710
Bravo!

784
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,670
Bravo!

785
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,340
Very nice.

786
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,070
Nice dance.

787
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:44,530
Indeed.

788
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,380
Lu,

789
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,680
you could have brought me here,

790
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,270
why made me stand in the cold outside?

791
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:58,130
I thought you could
hear more clearly from outside.

792
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,550
Besides,

793
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,010
did you expect me to

794
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:03,870
hold both of you
while eavesdropping by the window?

795
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,140
Lord Xu, you usually

796
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,870
wait until your wife falls asleep

797
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,000
before coming over.

798
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,080
Why didn't you go back today?

799
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,920
I wonder if she saw

800
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,920
that box of rouge.

801
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,920
Will she like it?

802
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:39,630
Yingying has been
increasingly cold to me these days.

803
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,890
I'd better not go back.

804
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,460
I'll wait a few days

805
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,010
until her anger subsides before returning.

806
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,420
Mrs. Xu is so persistent

807
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:48,240
and still misunderstands you, My Lord.

808
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,240
My Lord, do you

809
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,620
still truly not want to divorce her?

810
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:52,930
Of course not.

811
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,070
When I was still a nobody,

812
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,250
she followed me without hesitation.

813
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,340
It's all my fault

814
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,510
for not taking good care of her.

815
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,950
But since we made our vows,

816
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,280
I should never leave or abandon her.

817
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,350
Please forgive me, My Lord.

818
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,310
I have something to confess to you.

819
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,600
What is it?

820
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,320
Lord Xu, do you know

821
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,880
why Mrs. Xu asked for a divorce?

822
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,440
Why?

823
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,070
My Lord, you often
visit my Flower House,

824
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:30,240
so someone forced me to seduce you,

825
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,540
and marry into your household.

826
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,610
But you never crossed the line,

827
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,090
and to protect myself,

828
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,630
I had to lie to Mrs. Xu,

829
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,930
claiming I was pregnant.

830
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,580
What?

831
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:48,840
This...

832
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:52,390
No wonder Yingying
suddenly wanted a divorce.

833
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,450
I thought she despised me
for being uncouth

834
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,280
and not taking good care of her.

835
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:01,970
Xu Ao.

836
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,390
Dear.

837
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,540
Darling.

838
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,640
I have never despised you.

839
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,200
It's just that since our marriage,

840
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,660
I haven't been able
to bear you any children,

841
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,880
so I feel I've let you down terribly.

842
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:21,130
Besides, you've been distracted all year.

843
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,890
You haven't been talking to me.

844
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,390
I thought you had grown tired of me.

845
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,820
How could that be possible, Dear?

846
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,350
How could I ever tire of you?

847
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,510
I can't get enough of looking at you.

848
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:33,350
It's just that I have
important matters on my mind.

849
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,920
I often neglect your feelings.

850
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,530
Children come to us by fate,

851
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,580
and if they don't, it's heaven's will.

852
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,380
As long as I can grow old with you,

853
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,770
I dare not ask for more.

854
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:47,100
But you're the sole male heir
of three generations.

855
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,000
Your parents, before they passed away,
instructed me

856
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,600
to continue the family line.

857
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,260
How dare I not listen?

858
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,560
My silly wife.

859
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,230
If we truly cannot have one of our own,

860
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,840
and you still insist on having a child,

861
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,400
we could always adopt one.

862
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,210
Lord Xu speaks wisely.

863
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:04,220
A marriage is built by two people,

864
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,480
how can it depend on children?

865
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,500
If Lord Xu were to
divorce you over children,

866
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:11,590
then he wouldn't be a good husband anyway.

867
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,630
Miss Shi speaks the truth.

868
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,320
Do you truly feel this way?

869
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:21,240
I married you because I love you.

870
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,580
I would never divorce you over

871
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:26,770
this so-called inability
to continue the family line.

872
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,300
To have a husband like you,

873
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,170
I could ask for nothing more.

874
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,530
Madam.

875
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,620
Lord Xu.

876
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,590
I must have a word with you.

877
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:43,230
You sent rouge
but didn't tell Yingying about it.

878
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,440
If I hadn't overheard,

879
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,300
when would Yingying have seen it?

880
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,920
It's entirely my fault.

881
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,000
It's entirely my fault.

882
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,920
It's my fault.

883
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,300
I shouldn't have distrusted you.

884
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,310
Neither of you is at fault.

885
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:55,950
Blame me

886
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,070
for not eavesdropping earlier.

887
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:01,070
Ke, what exactly is going on?

888
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,370
Didn't we agree not to meet these days?

889
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:16,490
Why the rush to send a message

890
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:17,530
to ask me here?

891
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:21,930
Don't listen to those rumors out there.

892
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:24,090
There's nothing between Xu Ao and me.

893
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:25,190
It's just...

894
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:28,220
I have difficulties
that are hard to explain.

895
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,470
Just wait for me two or three more days,

896
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,130
once I finish what I need to do,

897
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,910
we can run away together.

898
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,830
Ms. Hua, what's troubling you?

899
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:46,960
Feel free to tell us.

900
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,140
Ms. Hua, won't you be honest with me?

901
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:55,200
Miss Shi, Chief Lu.

902
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,850
That letter was written
by Feng himself.

903
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,480
What have you done to him?

904
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,810
Rest assured, Ms. Hua.

905
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,270
Mr. Li is safe and sound.

906
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,040
Yuerong.

907
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,270
Feng.

908
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,960
Chief Lu is here to help us.

909
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,350
He can help us
get out of this predicament.

910
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,330
Lu.

911
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,840
These two share a deep bond.

912
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,970
I believe Ms. Hua has her reasons.

913
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:18,500
Chief Lu.

914
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,700
For everything before, I was indeed wrong.

915
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,570
I deeply apologize.

916
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,350
The reason I did this

917
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:26,700
is because I was coerced

918
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:29,090
and have difficulties I cannot speak of.

919
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,140
Who forced you?

920
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,450
Chief Lu.

921
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,340
Please forgive me
for not being able to tell you.

922
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,640
Don't worry, Ms. Hua.

923
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,520
I promise you

924
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,580
I will safely escort
both of you out of the capital.

925
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:42,850
Not just the two of us,

926
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:44,780
but our family of three.

927
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,850
Chief Lu.

928
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:50,110
Just bring Ms. Liu here,

929
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,720
and once the misunderstanding is cleared,

930
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,520
I can complete my task and leave.

931
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,550
Ms. Hua, you're straightforward.

932
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,830
When the truth comes to light,

933
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:57,830
I will send people

934
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,170
to escort you and Mr. Li
out of the capital.

935
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,940
Then I thank you, Chief Lu and Miss Shi.

936
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:07,670
We eavesdropped once

937
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:09,710
and found out that Lord Xu is innocent.

938
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:12,410
But Ms. Hua refused
to explain the situation,

939
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:14,860
fortunately Lu discovered the key person

940
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,920
and persuaded her.

941
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:16,680
Ke,

942
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,230
you were actually the one who noticed

943
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,830
the twin lotus jade pendant
at Ms. Hua's waist.

944
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,700
This pendant is a unique piece from
Xibao Pavilion's Qixi Festival collection.

945
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,500
There are two identical pieces,

946
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,790
meant for lovers.

947
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:32,780
Ms. Hua and Xu Ao
are not romantically involved,

948
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,070
so there must be someone else she loves.

949
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:37,730
I'll keep my word.

950
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,320
Ms. Hua,

951
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,220
I will ensure your family's safety.

952
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,100
Chief Lu, Miss Shi,

953
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,980
you've protected my reputation

954
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:45,530
and arranged a way out for me.

955
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,890
I am deeply grateful.

956
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:50,550
When all is said and done,
it's all your fault.

957
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:53,050
Fine, it's all my fault.

958
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,310
Why is it so hot today?

959
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,850
[No.1 Matchmaker in the World]

960
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,040
Mother.

961
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,670
At first, I thought no matter what,

962
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,450
I couldn't let them divorce,

963
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:32,100
because it would affect your reputation

964
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:32,390
[No.1 Matchmaker in the World]

965
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:34,610
and the title
of the No.1 matchmaker in the world.

966
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:36,850
But when I found out Xu Ao was unfaithful,

967
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:38,350
I couldn't use Yingying's pain

968
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:40,410
to protect our family's reputation.

969
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:43,710
So, if what Yingying said had been true,

970
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,190
I would definitely
have helped the two of them get a divorce.

971
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:48,030
Ke.

972
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,500
That day when you were
confiding in our ancestors,

973
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,110
[No.1 Matchmaker in the World]

974
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:54,770
I heard everything
outside the ancestral hall.

975
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:56,750
So, Mother,

976
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:59,220
you knew about their divorce matter?

977
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:02,330
I just hope

978
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,040
that all your decisions

979
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,860
come from your heart,

980
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,140
not because of me

981
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,790
or this title.

982
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:10,480
[No.1 Matchmaker in the World]

983
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,800
You're the best mother ever.

984
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:15,410
Then let me ask you,

985
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:17,540
even if I blame you,

986
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,340
will you still stay true to yourself?

987
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:22,600
I will.

988
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,610
What a good child.

989
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,360
[No.1 Matchmaker in the World]

990
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,560
You're a matchmaker.

991
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,280
Always remember

992
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,150
that with just a few words,

993
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:34,960
you can determine someone's happiness
for the rest of their life.

994
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,090
Nothing matters more than sincerity.

995
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,030
Whether it's my reputation

996
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,480
or the glory of being
the No.1 matchmaker in the world,

997
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,360
nothing is more important
than the happiness of two people.

998
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,920
That's the true essence of matchmaking.

999
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:57,790
Ke.

1000
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:00,100
Ke.

1001
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,960
You've saved Liu Yingying's marriage,

1002
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,420
why are you still unhappy?

1003
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:07,340
Lu, why are you here?

1004
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:09,110
Don't let my brothers find you.

1005
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:10,880
I originally wanted
to tell you some good news,

1006
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,210
but I heard you sighing.

1007
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:15,240
Why don't you tell me
what's troubling you?

1008
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:18,170
How would you understand?

1009
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:19,960
At weddings,

1010
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,820
I often wish couples
prosperity and many children.

1011
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:25,070
Yingying's marriage is secure now,

1012
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:26,870
but they still have no children.

1013
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:29,230
It shows that in life,
eight or nine times out of ten,

1014
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:30,550
things don’t go as planned.

1015
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:33,150
That's exactly the good news
I wanted to tell you.

1016
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:35,400
I've found a skilled doctor
who has examined Mrs. Xu,

1017
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,670
and there's a treatment available.

1018
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:38,240
So you don't need to worry too much.

1019
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,640
Xu Ao loves Liu Yingying,

1020
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,540
and doesn't care
that much about having children.

1021
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,140
Really?

1022
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:46,890
Thank you for resolving their concerns.

1023
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,240
Lu.

1024
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:51,920
If you were Xu Ao,

1025
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:53,000
what would you do?

1026
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,580
I would be the same.

1027
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,060
If I could marry the one I love,

1028
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,880
whether we have children or not,

1029
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,990
my devotion would never change.
