[Episode 13]

3
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,130
Ke, it's alright now.

4
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,820
I'm here with you.

5
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,080
I couldn't save Ms. Deng.

6
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,440
You did your best. Don't blame yourself.

7
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,370
Lu, what about Yanyan?

8
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,620
Let's go find Yanyan and the others.

9
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,450
Don't worry,

10
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,480
Zhuxi hasn't come out yet either.

11
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,940
But he knows martial arts,

12
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,840
maybe he's already found Miss Zhu

13
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,040
and taken her somewhere safe.

14
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,420
Where could they be?

15
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,990
I'll take you to find them right now.

16
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:20,740
Come.

17
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,810
Ke.

18
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:31,120
Come, let me carry you.

19
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,070
Mr. Lu, are you alright?

20
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,480
Does it hurt?

21
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,220
I'm fine.

22
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,990
Where are we?

23
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,710
Will the fire reach us soon?

24
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,240
Don't be afraid. I'm here with you.

25
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,660
I'll hold your hand.

26
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,410
Move forward
and we should be able to get out soon.

27
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,710
Lu, thank you for today.

28
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,010
If it weren't for you,

29
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,280
I don't know what would have happened.

30
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,910
Your duty

31
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,060
is to protect those
attending the Flower Assembly,

32
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,450
and my duty is to protect you.

33
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,370
I will always be by your side,

34
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,700
always protecting you.

35
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,650
Don't look at me.

36
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,760
I look awful when I cry.

37
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,620
No, you don't.

38
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,230
I think you're the most beautiful person,

39
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,579
and the one I love most.

40
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,490
I will always protect you,

41
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,100
never let you come to any harm,

42
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,900
so that you can live peacefully
and happily for the rest of your life.

43
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,510
Why are you suddenly saying all this?

44
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,650
It's not sudden.

45
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:49,079
I've always wanted to tell you this.

46
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,840
Yanyan.

47
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,010
Ke,

48
00:03:59,220 --> 00:03:59,930
Lu.

49
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,400
Yanyan.

50
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,460
You're okay.

51
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,700
Thank goodness!

52
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,150
Chi.

53
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,440
I was so scared.

54
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,400
Are you alright?

55
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,880
I'm fine, don't worry.

56
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,730
Don't move around,
you might aggravate your wound.

57
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,330
I'll take you to see a doctor.

58
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:14,910
Let's go.

59
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:17,600
Let's go.

60
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,210
Let me see if you're hurt anywhere.

61
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:27,940
Are you okay?

62
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,320
Good that it's nothing serious.

63
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,040
They're coming out! They're coming out!

64
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,640
They're out!

65
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,470
Chief Lu is out!

66
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,200
Miss Shi and the others are out!

67

Ke!

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,950
Ke! Ke!

69
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:38,500
Ketian,

70
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,390
-Fa'ke, are you alright?
-Chief, Deputy Chief, are you alright?

71
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,490
Don't worry, I'm fine.

72
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,880
Are you all okay too?

73
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,100
We're all fine.

74
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,720
Ke, have you seen Ms. Deng?

75
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,430
She's the only one missing now.

76
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,890
I can't find her anywhere.

77
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,330
Ms. Deng...

78
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,730
She's gone.

79
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,560
We tried to save her from the fire,

80
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,620
but the beam collapsed.

81
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,760
It was too late.

82
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,770
What are we going to do?

83
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,030
How could this happen?

84
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,270
Chief, I've done a headcount.

85
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,620
Except for Ms. Deng,

86
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:30,030
everyone else
attending the meeting has escaped.

87
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,100
Thank you, Miss Shi. Thank you, Chief Lu.

88
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,880
Thank you for saving our lives.

89
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,740
No need to thank us.

90
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,680
I'm just glad everyone is safe.

91
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,870
You're all too kind.

92
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,210
[Flower Manor]

93
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,520
Take Shi Fa'ke away.

94
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,380
Yes!

95
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,050
I...

96
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,550
General Li, what is the meaning of this?

97
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,160
The smoke here is billowing to the sky,

98
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,090
visible even from the city center.

99
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,200
Shi Fa'ke.

100
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,380
As the organizer
of the Flower Assembly,

101
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,920
you're disregarding
human lives and committing crimes.

102
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,909
Shouldn't you be punished?

103
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:39,790
General,

104
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,409
of course the arsonist should be arrested
for the fire at the Flower Assembly,

105
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:46,070
but what reason do you have to arrest
an innocent marriage broker?

106
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,210
Who gave you the right to speak here?

107
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,340
General Li,

108
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,540
when the fire broke out,

109
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,030
I was hosting the Flower Assembly.

110
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,690
Everyone present can testify for me.

111
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,090
What evidence do you have

112
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,850
that I'm the one who committed arson?

113
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,310
You must have
accomplices working with you.

114
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,430
Slanderous lies!

115
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,880
Whether it's slander
or deserved punishment,

116
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,000
you all must come with me

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,260
and we'll find out after investigation.

118
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,110
The innocent have nothing to fear.

119
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,500
I have done nothing wrong

120
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,850
and am willing
to accept your investigation.

121
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:16,980
But I'm warning you,

122
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,940
if you dare harm anyone here,

123
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,420
I will certainly report
this injustice to the Emperor.

124
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,240
General Li,

125
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,570
cases are to be
tried at the magistrate's office,

126
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,860
and the Imperial Cavalry Bureau
handles security matters.

127
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,080
Why is the Military Headquarters
sending troops

128
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,080
to arrest people?

129
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,090
Are you going to disregard court protocol

130
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:33,680
and exceed your authority?

131
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,560
Lu Chi.

132
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,480
Shi Fa'ke,

133
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,380
with such a major incident
at the Flower Assembly,

134
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,540
as the organizer,

135
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,620
shouldn't you take responsibility?

136
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,580
The Flower Assembly
was funded by Xibao Pavilion.

137
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,860
Lu Chi, you cannot escape blame either.

138
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,340
That's right,

139
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,300
I am the organizer.

140
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,630
I do bear responsibility.

141
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,880
I'll go with you for questioning.

142
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,490
Ke,

143
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,220
no!

144
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,080
Since Miss Shi has admitted it herself,

145
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,930
guards, take her away.

146
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,820
Who dares!

147
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,970
I am a witness.

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,320
I can testify for Ke.

149
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:12,800
Yanyan.

150
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,260
I am Lord Zhu's granddaughter, Zhu Yanyan.

151
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,540
I saw with my own eyes
that Ms. Deng started the fire.

152
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,070
I can prove these
two had nothing to do with it.

153
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,630
You!

154
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,920
Words alone are not enough proof.

155
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,900
This waist token

156
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,130
dropped from Chief Matchmaker Deng.

157
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,130
[Chief Matchmaker]

158
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,580
I witnessed her setting fire
to the Flower Assembly with my own eyes.

159
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,530
I can testify.

160
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,230
I was the one who rescued
Miss Zhu from the fire.

161
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,400
Then where is Chief Matchmaker Deng?

162
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,799
Have her come out to face questioning.

163
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:43,169
Chief Matchmaker Deng
has perished in the fire.

164
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,180
Are you trying to pin all the blame

165
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,260
on a dead person?

166
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,240
I suspect Chief Matchmaker Deng's death

167
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,250
is connected to all of you.

168
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,740
The truth of the matter

169
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,230
will be revealed in court.

170
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,410
Guards, seize them!

171
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:55,960
Yes, Sir.

172
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,520
You can't take Miss Shi away!

173
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,940
You can't take her away!

174
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,440
Don't take her!

175
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,910
Leave her alone!

176
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,490
Don't take her!

177
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,030
Don't take her!

178
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,400
The Prime Minister is here!

179
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,190
Grandfather!

180
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,570
-Yanyan, are you hurt?
-I'm not hurt.

181
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,280
Grandfather, please help Ke get justice.

182
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,230
I clearly saw

183
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,410
Chief Matchmaker Deng
set fire to the Flower Assembly.

184
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,180
General Li insists on
arresting Ke and pressing charges.

185
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,150
Yanyan, don't worry.

186
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,150
Greetings, Lord Zhu.

187
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,400

to make Ms. Deng set a fire.

559

And after setting the fire,

560
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,550
why didn't she leave
but stayed at the scene?

561
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:12,010
Actually, yesterday
I saw someone in black,

562

rescuing people, couldn't pay attention.

564

the mastermind behind this

566
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:22,740

567
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,020
Then who could be behind all this?

568
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,750
Marquis Wu'an.

569
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,530

570
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,150
My mother refused his request before,

571
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,190
could this be the cause of the trouble?

572
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,640
Chief Matchmaker Tao
is the No.1 matchmaker in the world,

573
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,570
who has arranged countless marriages.

574
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,680
You should have realized
on your coming-of-age ceremony

575
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,200
how many officials and nobles came

576
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,930
to congratulate her daughter.

577
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,920
That's the reputation
my mother earned from her matchmaking.

578
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,280
Could it be that Marquis Wu'an

579
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,610
wants to control the agency
through my mother,

580
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,960
and then through the agency,

581
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,250
control these people's marriages?

582
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:56,900
Yes,

583
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,260
he wants to use
the Official Matchmaking Agency

584
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,880
to strengthen his power
through arranged marriages.

585
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,350
After failing to win
over Chief Matchmaker Tao,

586
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,920
he supported Ms. Deng instead.

587
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,290
But you repeatedly

588
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,460
ruined his plans.

589
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,230
So he decided to kill you.

590

Even if the fire couldn't kill you,

591

it could still ruin your reputation.
