00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,800
Ke, you're here.

4
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,780
Brother Lu.

5
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,840
When we don't see each other

6
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,970
for days, do you feel like

7
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,039
we're happier than before

8
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,380
when we meet again?

9
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,530
Why would we be apart for days?

10
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,560
Well,

11
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,979
for example,

12
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,420
I have my affairs to settle,

13
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,560
and you have yours,

14
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,850
and we won't bother each other.

15
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,650
Aren't your affairs my affairs?

16
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,570
You won't bother me,
and I won't bother you.

17
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,970
What kind of talk is that?

18
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,479
Do you know that

19
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,100
I need some peace and quiet too?

20
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,170
I also need that sweet feeling
of missing someone.

21
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,829
Ke, are you tired of me

22
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,000
and want to get away from me?

23
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm saying one thing,
and you're saying another.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,320
We're not even talking
about the same thing.

25
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,120
Then what are you talking about?

26
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,970
Why did you send Lu Yi to follow me?

27
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,860
He wasn't protecting you.

28
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,660
He was protecting you.

29
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,470
The Marquis Wu'an has been quiet lately,

30
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,800
which is very abnormal.

31
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,920
There must be something fishy.

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,550
Now that you're a top marriage broker at
the Official Matchmaking Agency,

33
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,079
I have to be extra cautious.

34
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,400
But

35
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,400
I feared the truth might scare you,

36
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,100
so I had Lu Yi guard you secretly.

37
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,580
I thought you were having someone watch me

38
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,600
to keep tabs on my whereabouts.

39
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,210
Brother Lu.

40
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,470
I won't blame you so easily again.

41
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,680
It's okay if you blame me.

42
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,800
But from now on,

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,030
please don't talk about
missing each other from afar

44
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,160
or not disturbing each other anymore.

45
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,800
Alright, I understand.

46
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,490
Promise.

47
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,780
Okay, I promise.

48
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,290
Uncle, you asked to see me.

49
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,620
What orders do you have?

50
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,880
Xibao Pavilion's Lu Zhuxi

51
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,200
went to that old man Zhu's house
to propose marriage.

52
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,829
If his granddaughter

53
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,210
really marries that brat,

54
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,330
where does that leave my dignity?

55
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,940
Yes, Uncle, I know what I must do now.

56
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,870
Give it to me.

57
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,190
Ke, don't be upset.

58
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,830
Were the betrothal gifts
not substantial enough?

59
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,310
Besides the existing betrothal gifts,

60
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,920
how about I add a few more shops?

61
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,560
It's not about the betrothal gifts.

62
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,560
How could Lord Zhu possibly
value betrothal gifts

63
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,300
more than Yanyan's marriage?

64
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,810
Then what's the reason?

65
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,490
You rascal.

66
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,480
Your sister-in-law and I
have worked so hard

67
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,540
for your marriage.

68
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,770
And here you are,
drinking tea in the cool breeze,

69
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,130
not worried at all.

70
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,870
Brother Lu, it's not settled yet.

71
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,010
It will be soon.

72
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,010
No escape now.

73
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:20,480
Sit down.

74

Deputy Chief.

76
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,510
I brought down the things

77
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,170
you wanted from the mountian.

78
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,580
Brother and sister-in-law,
for your great kindness,

79
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,970
I am deeply grateful.

80
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,950
However, I need to go back and
organize some things now.

81
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,270
Regarding my marriage,

82
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,510
please don't worry,

83
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,130
I have my own brilliant plan.

84
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,780
Lu Yi, let's go.

85
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,480
Let's go.

86
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,110
Go, go.

87
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,230
Is this okay?

88
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:51,620
Here.

89
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,460
This time, it's twice as much as before.

90
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,990
I wonder if Lord Zhu will be satisfied?

91
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,500
Brother Lu,

92
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,080
you really came well-prepared this time.

93
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,160
Although Lord Zhu won't care
just for the betrothal gifts,

94
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,790
we still need to show our sincerity.

95
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,520
What's the point of our efforts

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,730

holed up in his room for days

Please ask young Mr. Lu to come out.

100

106
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,600
You sent Lu Yi back to the mountain

107
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,640
to get these?

108
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,550
Yes.

109

111
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,120
In the winter of the Guiyou year,
heavy snow fell on the mountain.

112
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,480
My brother trained daily, after which
he would be soaked through with sweat.

113
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,080
Yet he stayed by me,
tending food and medicine.

114
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,820
Our father was obsessed with martial arts
and rarely cared for us.

115
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,030
Thankfully, I had my brother's protection.

116
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,430
So you've kept all these.

117
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,610
I...

118
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,409
Stop reading.

119
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,380
These are meant for Yanyan to read.

120
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,020
What? As the matchmaker,
I can't read them?

121
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,740
After Yanyan has read them,

122
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,350
I'll show you the parts about Brother.

My parts

Ke, let him be.

126
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,480
He probably even recorded

127
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,090
how many times he cried each day,

128
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,400
and how he was afraid of the dark
and wouldn't get out of bed.

129

130
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,930
Never mind then,

131
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,260
I won't read it.

132
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,550
I wrote about my life on
the mountain growing up,

133
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,720
and my daily longing

134

after meeting Yanyan.

136
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,360
I want to show all these to
Yanyan and Lord Zhu,

137
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,150
so they can understand me better.

138
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:37,790
This way,

139
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,480
Lord Zhu will feel comfortable
entrusting Yanyan to me.

140
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,830
This bundle of writings

141
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,890
is indeed more precious than any treasure.

142
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,820

will definitely happen.

let me read more,

00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,410
Alright, quiet down.

555
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,970
Mr. Lu, please rise.

556
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Mr. Lu, you're handsome and well-mannered.

557
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,560
You and Ke do seem to share fate.

558
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,890
I often hear Ke praising you at home,

559
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,280
saying how much you've helped her.

560
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,970
But Ke is still young.

561
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,400
You two haven't known each other for long.

562
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,380
As her elder,

563
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,510
I don't know much about
your background and family.

564
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,130
As Ke's mother,

565
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,410
how could I be so careless
about my child's marriage?

566
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,800
After all, in the Shi family,

567
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,710
she is our only daughter.

568
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,750
I understand, Aunt.

569
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,550
Though Ke and I haven't
known each other long,

570
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,350
we have experienced

571
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,810
things others never have.

572
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,040
We understand each other deeply.

573
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,570
Please rest assured, Aunt.

574
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,350
After marriage,
I will continue to support Ke,

575
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,400
helping her be a good marriage broker,

576
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,460
and won't interfere with her career.

577
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,880
I ask for you and Uncle's blessing.

578
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,070
Cousin, quick, go to the front hall.

579
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,350
Mr. Lu brought Marriage Broker Zhao

580
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,880
to propose marriage to you.

581
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,330
But your Uncle and Aunt...

582
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,090
So soon?

583
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,880
Chief Matchmaker Tao,
maybe we should ask Ke what she thinks?

584
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,590
Hello, Marriage Broker Zhao.

585
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,370
Father, Mother, brothers.

586
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,240
Ke.

587
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,750
Hello to you too, Brother Lu.

588
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,480
You're acting with no decorum.

589
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,400
You're a marriage broker yourself.

590
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,240
Don't you know the parents must meet first
in these matters?

591
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,240
A young lady showing herself like this,
how improper!

592
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,620
Mr. Lu,

593
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,010
you know everything about our family.

594
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,340
We have two sons and one daughter.

595
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:47,530
May I ask about your family situation?

596
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,680
There's only me and my younger brother
Lu Zhuxi at home.

597
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,550
Our parents have both passed away.

598
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,550
We have no known distant relatives.

599
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,660
At Xibao Pavilion, Lu Yi and Li Pan'er

600
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:59,040
are like family to my brother and me.

601
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,710
Then where is your ancestral home?

602
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,100
Mother, Brother Lu is from another region.

603
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,930
I wasn't asking you, Shi Fa'ke.

604
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,490
One more word and
you'll go back to your room.

605
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:18,980
I'm...

606
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,010
I'm from Mount Qianya.

607
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,610
Mount Qianya?

608
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,770
The one that's crawling with bandits?

609
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,200
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

610
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,830
Mother, Mount Qianya isn't what you think.

611
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,510
Brother Lu and
his younger brother Lu Zhuxi

612
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,440
are good people.

613
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,350
They've never harmed anyone.

614
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,350
Please don't believe those rumors.

615
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,740
Ke, hearsay is unreliable,

616
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,560
but seeing is believing.

617
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,360
If they've done anything wrong,

618
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,290
why would everyone say otherwise?

619
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,440
Chief Lu isn't a bad person.

620
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,370
Neither is Brother Lu Yi.

621
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,500
Mr. Lu, I cannot accept

622
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,350
this marriage proposal.

623
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,470
Ke is still young,

624
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,120
and she's quite impulsive.

625
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,510
You two haven't known each other
long enough.

626
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,040
It's inappropriate to
discuss marriage now.

627
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,480
Ke's two elder brothers

628
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,550
aren't even married yet.

629
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,890
Since ancient times,
it's unheard of for a sister

630
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,510
to marry before her brothers.

631
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,510
Thank you for coming today, Mr. Lu.

632
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,750
Please leave now.

633
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,160
Mother!

634
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,160
Brother Lu and I have
known each other for a long time.

635
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,870
When he was young,
he wandered into the capital.

636
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,080
That's when we met.

637
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:34,020
I wanted to give him
our family's gold badge,

638
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,350
but he said it was too valuable
and firmly refused.

639
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:38,020
So I gave him some desserts instead.

640
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,950
We made a promise

641
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:40,870
that when I came of age,

642
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,730
he would come to marry me.

643
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,600
He's here to fulfill
that promise now, Mother.

644
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,600
You won't even listen to
your mother anymore?

645
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,200
I just want to marry Brother Lu!

646
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,300
How shameless!

647
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,440
How could a young lady say such things!

648
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:57,950
Ke.

649
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,740
I understand what you're saying, Aunt.

650
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,460
I was indeed rash today,

651
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,240
and I hope you both can forgive me.

652
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,330
It's just that Ke is

653
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:15,080
truly the most precious person
in the world to me.

654
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,680
So I will never give up on her.

655
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,200
I will do everything in my power

656
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,120
to protect her,

657
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,110
to make her happy.

658
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:24,040
I won't let her suffer any grievance
for the rest of her life.

659
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,570
She will have my whole heart

660

until the end of our days.

661
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,640
So I hope you both will

662
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,960
give me some more time

663
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,930

take the post.

736
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,210
Come on, I'll take you to
eat something delicious today.

[Official Matchmaking Agency, Fang Yue]

[Official Matchmaking Agency]

742
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:28,200
Miss, why have you come so early?

743
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,160
The other marriage brokers
haven't arrived yet.

744
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,060
If you don't know any marriage brokers,

745
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,390
feel free to tell me about your situation.

746
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,670
Who are you?

747
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,210
My name is Shi Fa'ke,

748
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,410
I'm a marriage broker from
the Official Matchmaking Agency.

749
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,700
Miss, you are so beautiful.

750
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:45,730
I wonder what requirements
you have for a partner?

751
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:49,550
Do you arrange matches for those
who love someone unrequited?

752
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,360
Marriage is about mutual consent and love.

753
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,770
Miss, why are you so persistent?

754
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,580
People are born

755
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,520
with someone meant just for them.

756
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,200
If you can't have this person,

757
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:04,830
then he's not yours.

758
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,990
Let them go when it's time to let go.

759
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,400
Making yourself happy

760
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,930
is also a kind of happiness.

761
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,350
What if you meet someone

762
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,860
who's dead set on forcing it through?

763
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,670
Miss, may I know your name first?

764
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,320
Fang Yue.

765
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,550
The moon waxes and wanes.

766
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,140
A square has all four corners intact.

767
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:33,170
Miss, your name is quite unique.

768
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,590
Is it?

769
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,510
Judging by your accent,

770
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,630
you don't seem to be from the capital.

771
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,150
Where are you from,

772
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,500
and do you have any relatives here?

773
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,900
I have no relatives here.

774
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,020
I came to the capital specifically.

775
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,680
Specifically to the capital?

776
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:51,400
Was it to see
that someone you couldn't have?

777
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,550
May I ask what kind of man

778
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,190
has caught your fancy?

779
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:59,710
In my eyes, he's brave and extraordinary.

780
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:03,070
He's skilled in riding,
archery, and horsemanship,

781
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,730
a man of letters and arms
who could rule a nation.

782
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,890
His status is quite unique.

783
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,810
He was widowed early and never remarried.

784
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,450
Some say

785
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:14,670
he must be unwilling to give up
his dalliances with various women.

786
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,800
But that's not true.

787
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,970
I know he's destined for greatness,

788
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,810
and is unwilling to be
constrained by romantic entanglements.

789
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,600
Unique status,

790
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,210
widowed...

791
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,860
Who on earth is this man?

792
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:31,970

793
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,930
you're here early.

at the Agency.

How could it be her?

810
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,360
What about Ke?

811
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,000
Yeah.

00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,460
What's going on?

813
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,150
Listen, Fang Yue,

814
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,570

00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:49,550
you are the Chief Matchmaker of
the capital's Official Matchmaking Agency.

Thank you, Lord Zheng.

817
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:52,330
Don't mention it.

818
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,820
If there's nothing else,
I'll take my leave.

819
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,020
Take care, Lord Zheng.

820
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,280
I haven't had the chance to
introduce myself to everyone yet.

821
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,340
My name is Fang Yue.

822
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,870

and arrange successful matches
for our clients together,

826
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,460
Yes.

827
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:29,620
Yes.

828
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,630
So Marriage Broker Fang is
the famous matchmaker from Suzhou,

829
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,210
known as the Moon Goddess?

all the talented people are being
transferred to the capital.

832
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:39,480
Before coming here, I'd already heard that

833
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,800
the marriage brokers at the agency
are quite young,

834
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,400
yet have impressive results

835
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,480
and are very diligent in their work.

836
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:48,430
I arrived early today and
was waiting in the hall.

837
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:50,650
Marriage Broker Shi warmly engaged me
in conversation

838
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:52,970
without showing the slightest impatience.

839
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,780
I hope you all can be like this when
matchmaking in the future.

840
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:58,090
Make more visits, be more active,

841
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,490
be more proactive with our clients,

842
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:03,370
don't give up easily
when facing difficulties,

843
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:06,070
and bring together
as many loving couples as possible.

844
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:06,930
Yes.

845
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:07,840
Yes.

846
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,600
Ke, why aren't you wearing
the Chief Matchmaker uniform?

847
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,770
The new Chief Matchmaker has taken office,

848
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:35,580
and it's not me.
