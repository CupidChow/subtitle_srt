What are you trying to do?

No one's taking him!

You're calling my daughter wifey?

Are you pretending to be confused?

38
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,770
Trying to take advantage?

39
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,030
So I'm not married to wifey yet.

Father, you forgot what the doctor said.

He said Brother Lu was injured

saying his daughter must like the man.

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,050
So what?

Lu Chi was poisoned a couple days ago,

00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,470
It shouldn't affect our plans anymore.

Don't bother with Lu Chi.

110
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,070
Since this Shen Tongyun
likes handsome men,

111
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,130
we'll give her what she wants.

I haven't assigned you any case,

to be her matchmaker.

137
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,090
Are you going to disregard
a client's wishes?

138
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,120
That doesn't seem very proper, does it?

139
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,490
You're talking complete nonsense.

140
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:16,890
Do you know that

141
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,920
Shen Tongyun has already
complained to me about

142
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,040

how you've treated Miss Shen—

145
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,070

Let me tell you,

Shen Tongyun has already entrusted me
with her matchmaking case.

150
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,330
How could I allow you to
mess things up again?

00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,300
What are you doing?

00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,330

00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,730
Ouch!

let me give you some friendly advice.

Please stop pointing fingers at me,

160
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,120
or Mr. Lu might think you're bullying me

161
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,040
because I'm young, beautiful,
and kind-hearted.

162
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,110
It would be a shame if you got hurt.

163

If anyone dares to bully my wife again,

165
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,280
I'll make them...

166
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,240
Pay for it.

Ke!

170

What's your relationship with him?

171
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,490
It's nothing.

172
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,820
He's just injured and lost his memory,

173
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,310
and insists I'm his unmarried wife.

with his looks

177
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,080
and how protective he is of you,

178
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,679
marrying him wouldn't be a bad deal.

179
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,669
Marriage Broker Zhao, stop joking around,

180
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,600
His mind isn't right at the moment.

181
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:39,890
When he's lucid,

182
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,700
he's always staring at Shen Tongyun.

183
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,560
Did he say he likes Shen Tongyun?

184
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,130
He hasn't actually said so,

185
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,460
but there's definitely something there.

186
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,530
Shi Fa'ke!

187
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,720
Let me make this clear to you,

188
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,400
Shen Tongyun has personally asked me

189
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,310
to handle her matchmaking case.

190
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,070
As the Chief Matchmaker of
the Official Matchmaking Agency,

191
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,930
I order you to organize the documents
for me right now

192
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,240
and stop loitering around here.

193
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,840
Ms. Deng,

194
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,240
there's no rule saying one matchmaker
gets exclusive rights to a client.

195
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,080
Besides, Lu Chi and He Kexian,
who Shen Tongyun is interested in,

196
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,590
are both close to me.

197
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,750
So naturally, I should
be the one handling this case.

198
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,520
The Official Matchmaking Agency
should be supportive

199
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,030
and let the most capable person
do the job.

200
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,360
That won't be necessary.

201
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,020
The portrait of

202
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,340
the man I found Shen Tongyun

203
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,550
has already been viewed by her,

204
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,270
and she's quite pleased with it.

205
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,280
I'll only believe this

206
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,100
when Miss Shen

207
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,050
says so herself.

208
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,670
If you also want to work on
this matchmaking case,

209
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,530
then may the best matchmaker win.

210
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,160
Let's go.

211
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,390
Shi Fa'ke, you...

212
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,230
Brother Lu.

213
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,810
I need to clear something up with you.

214
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,740
Little girl, you remember me?

215
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,170
You're the one with amnesia,

216
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,170
why are you asking if I remember you?

217
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,020
We agreed, didn't we?

218
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,300
You are my wife,

219
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,820
and once you come of age,

220
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,280
I will marry you, alright?

221
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,770
That poison was really strong.

222
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,750
Your brain is truly damaged.

223
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,840
Brother Lu, you're starting to
talk nonsense.

224
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,630
This is not bad too.

225
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,950
Stay close to me, don't get lost.

226
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,630
Or someone with ulterior motives

227
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,250
might trick you into signing
a loan or something

228
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,550
and then Xibao Pavilion would be in trouble.

229
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,020
You're right, Wifey.

230
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,450
I've told you, I'm not your wife.

231
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,770
You seem foolish,

232
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,360
yet you're not confused.

233
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,400
Of course I'm not confused.

234
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,850
Brother Lu, let me ask you,

235
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,910
tell me the truth.

236
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,080
You were following Shen Tongyun...

237
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,690
Is she the person you're looking for?

238
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,180
No.

239
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,850
Then Shen Tongyun is your little girl?

240
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,870
No.

241
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:06,850
You like her.

242
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:07,880
No.

243
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,250
I'm not your wife.

244
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,860
You are.

245
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,340
See? You're still confused.

246
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,620
I don't like anyone else.

247
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,680
Brother Lu, your memory's a mess and

248
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,170
you don't remember what happened before.

249
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,370
But don't worry.

250
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,600
This happened because of me.

251
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,960
I will take good care of you

252
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,150
until you recover.

253
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,990
If you never recover,

254
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,460
I'll take care of you for life.

255
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,320
For real?

256
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,250
Then I can still stay at your home?

257
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,370
You must have been scared

258
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,250
by my father and brothers, right?

259
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,030
Don't worry.

260
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,910
I, Shi Fa'ke, always keep my word.

261
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,830
Well, I want to see some paintings and calligraphy.

262
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,000
Paintings and calligraphy?

263
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,960
Sure.

264
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,950
I'll take you to Xibao Pavilion.

265
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,200
Maybe you'll even remember something.

266
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,960
But my family is definitely not
shirking responsibility.

267
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,730
I'll make sure you're healed.

268
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,060
However, when you see Sister Pan'er,

269
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,080
please don't tell her it was my brothers

270
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,960
who caused you to get hurt.

271
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,350
Otherwise, if she reports to
the authorities,

272
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,300
my brothers will be finished.

273
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,180
Alright, I understand.

274
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,370
My lips are sealed.

275
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,050
Let's go, quickly.

276
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,040
Let's go.

277
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,860
[Yunlou Painting Shop]

278
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,380
Brother Lu, why aren't we
going to Xibao Pavilion?

279
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,590
Doesn't Xibao Pavilion have more famous paintings and calligraphy?

280
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,340
I really like this place, Ke.

281
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,420
Although these aren't
famous paintings and calligraphy,

282
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,880
they have real character.

283
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,400
Not bad.

284
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,440
It seems I was shortsighted

285
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,900
and didn't notice this place.

286
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,230
If you like it, let's find the owner
and ask about the price.

287
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,180
Hello? Is anyone here?

288
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,900
Miss Shen?

289
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,820
Why are you here?

290
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,680
The owner is my friend.

291
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,400
He stepped out for a while.

292
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,530
And you two...?

293
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,470
Miss Shen.

294
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,060
Please don't misunderstand

295
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,150
Haven't you heard?

296
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,740
Brother Lu has lost his memory.

297
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,900
Are you trying to take advantage of him

298
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,040
while he's confused?

299
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,090
Shi Fa'ke, you're a marriage broker!

300
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,390
I asked you to arrange my match first,

301
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,540
how could you steal my man?

302
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,970
No, no, no, I'm not.

303
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,410
-Okay, since you're
not trying to steal him...
-You misunderstood me.

304
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,140
why didn't you visit me sooner?

305
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,550
Miss Shen,

306
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,670
after meeting with Marriage Broker Deng,

307
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,540
do you still want to marry Lu Chi?

308
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,940
Marriage Broker Deng approached me first.

309
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,390
She's the Chief Matchmaker of
the Official Matchmaking Agency.

310
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,910
I couldn't really say no.

311
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,370
I'm sure Ms. Deng found you a good match.

312
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,940
Now, Lu is still recovering
from his injuries.

313
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,310
If you want to change your mind,

314
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:03,630
I would...

315
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,440
I didn't.

316
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,020
Ms. Deng said it's just an introduction.

317
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,110
No commitment was made.

318
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,790
To be honest,

319
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,440
Brother Lu was poisoned and injured

320
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,770
trying to save me.

321
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,800
He has now lost all his past memories...

322
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,590
I will see to it that he recovers.

323
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,440
As for you,

324
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,680
if you've no feelings for him,

325
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,520
then let's be clear about it.

326
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:27,750
He's injured?

327
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,680
And it was because he was saving someone?

328
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,220
He really looks good

329
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,710
and he has a kind heart too.

330
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,730
Thank goodness his face is fine.

331
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,170
How about this?

332
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,380
Bring him to my home,

333
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,110
I have many maids and servants,

334
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,120
I'll make sure he lives in comfort.

335
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,470
Fine clothes and food go without saying,

336
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,630
but I'll also get
the best doctors to treat him.

337
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,690
Even if he never gets his memory back,

338
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,400
you're still willing to take care of him?

339
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,600
Marriage Broker Shi.

340
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,620
As long as you can make this happen,

341
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,420
I'll entrust my marriage to you,

342
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:59,210
and I won't go through with
Ms. Deng's proposal.

343
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,750
But I've already asked Brother Lu,

344
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,150
he said he's not willing.

345
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,040
Maybe it's best to let it go.

346
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,070
Marriage Broker Shi.

347
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,000
Is it Lu Chi who's unwilling,

348
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,180
or is it you who's unwilling
due to personal motives?

349
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,530
As a marriage broker,

350
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,550
you're sabotaging a client's case.

351
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,710
You must be the first in agency history.

352
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,930
No, no, no, I have no personal motives,

353
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,680
but you should ask for his opinion too.

354
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,700
Why don't we wait a few more days—

355
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,460
though he has lost his memory,

356
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,850
he's not completely unaware.

357
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,240
If you have no personal motives,

358
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,480
and he's not a fool,

359
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,740
why wait any longer?

360
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,330
How about this?

361
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,400
Let me spend some time with him

362
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,540
with you around.

363
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,430
Let him decide. What do you think?

364
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,920
That's... fine.

365
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,110
Ke, let's wait for
the painting shop owner,

366
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,690
I've taken a liking to a painting.

367
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,580
The owner of this painting shop
is my close friend,

368
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,970
Mr. Lu, if you like something,
just let me know.

369
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,670
Who are you?

370
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,080

I've always been straightforward.

385

No.

I'm here to admit my fault.

According to your original plan,

431
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,090
I was to pose as an assassin
and poison her,

432
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:52,950
and you would heroically save her,

433
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,340
and pretend to faint from the attack.

434
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,040

grateful to you, making everything easier.

438
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,230
It would also resolve Shen Tongyun's
obsession with you,

439
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,230
killing three birds with one stone.

440

00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,180
and how much it costs?

556
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:42,970
Is the owner here?

557
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,160
Why don't I deliver these paintings

558
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,420
directly to your home?

559
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,500
That would save you the trouble of
going back and forth.

560
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,890
No need.

561
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,130
I've been in a foul mood lately,

562
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,530
so it's good to get some fresh air.

563
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,280
After chatting with you for a while

564
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,290
and seeing the paintings
you picked for me,

565
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,250
my mood has indeed improved quite a bit.

566
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,070
Ren.

567
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,570
You're so well-read,

568
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,590
and you know my preferences
better than anyone.

569
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,780
Only when I talk with you

570
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,090
can I ease my heart.

571
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,020
Tongyun, we grew up together.

572
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,900
Of course I know what you like.

573
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,750
Does Scholar Wang
have feelings for Miss Shen?

574
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,190
Brother Lu.

575
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,460
How about we put on a little show?

576
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,200
Is that really a good idea?

577
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,280
Just to test the waters.

578
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,770
I want to help them too.

579
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,640
I specially selected these paintings,

580
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,640
knowing you would surely like them.

581
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,910
Then please stay here, Ren.

582
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,650
I can go back by myself.

583
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,950
Oh, when did you arrive?

584
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,120
Please forgive my poor hospitality.

585
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,590
We're just browsing.

586
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,740
Yes.

587
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,570
Then please feel free to look around,

588
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,740
and let me know if you need anything.

589
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,320
Brother Lu,

590
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,030
look at this painting.

591
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,910
Doesn't the girl in this painting

592
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:17,040
look a lot like Miss Shen Tongyun?

593
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,010
Actually, I don't blame you.

594
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,830
It's understandable that

595
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,390
you don't want to marry her.

596
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,980
After all, she's proposed to
every handsome man

597
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,440
in the capital.

598
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,440
Indeed. That Miss Shen
has quite a reputation.

599
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,220
What reputation?

600
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,870
Everyone calls her
boy-crazy behind her back.

601
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:41,320
If you two want to gossip about others,

602
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,520
please leave this place.

603
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,100
Yun just

604
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,850
has a love for beauty.

605
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:46,150
Yun?

606
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,800
You seem quite close to her.

607
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:54,060
What's your relationship?

608
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,530
You're willing to drive customers away

609
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,820
just to defend her.

610
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,950
Aren't you afraid of hurting business?

611
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,280
I don't care about business or customers.

612
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,540
If you criticize Yun,

613
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,900
I will make you leave.

614
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,190
Well, Scholar Wang.

615
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,690
I'm Shi Fa'ke from
the Official Matchmaking Agency.

616
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,420
I've taken on Miss Shen's case.

617
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,240
As a matchmaker,

618
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,060
we can see into
people's hearts at a glance.

619
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,590
I can see you have
deep feelings for Miss Shen,

620
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,580
so why won't you propose to her?

621
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,210
I...

622
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,600
Some opportunities

623
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:25,540
will be lost if you don't pursue them.

624
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,960
Yun has loved beauty since childhood,

625
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,620
while I am ordinary-looking.

626
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,320
She would never choose someone like me.

627
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,660
How can you confuse
loving beauty with loving a person?

628
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:40,300
Shen Tongyun has indeed
pursued many handsome men,

629
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,770
but it was always one-sided.

630
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,310
I don't think she's happy.

631
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,630
But when she's with you,

632
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,940
her smile is gentle and beautiful.

633
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,700
It's clear that in her heart,

634
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,710
she does have some feelings for you.

635
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,030
Besides, you two grew up together

636
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,500
and share common interests.

637
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,700
What a perfect match!

638
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,130
Scholar Wang,

639
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,710
are you really

640
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:02,770
not going to make an effort

641
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,460
for your lifelong happiness?

642
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,220
The worst that could happen

643
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,120
is that she marries someone else,

644
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,390
but at least you'll have no regrets.

645
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,050
Marriage Broker Shi.

646
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,570
Please use this painting
as my betrothal gift

647
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,830
and propose to Shen Tongyun on my behalf.

648

[Shen's Mansion]

649
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,640
Get down.

650
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,020
Ke, aren't you going in to propose?

651
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,190
I'll go with you.

652
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,620
Are you crazy?

653
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,500
I'm going in on behalf of Wang Ren.

654
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,040
You rejected Shen Tongyun before

655
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,150
and made her storm off.

656
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:03,080
How would it look if you went in now?

657
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,160
Besides, if you go in with Wang Ren,

658
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,670
I could talk until I'm blue in the face

659
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,610
and still not change Shen Tongyun's mind.

660
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,510
Just bear with it for a while

661
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,040
and wait for me
in that alley over there, okay?

662
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:24,600
[Shen's Mansion]

663
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,090
Ren.

664
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,380
Why did you come with Marriage Broker Shi?

665
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,910
He's here to deliver a gift.

666
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:36,760
Miss Shen, please take a look at this.

667
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,020
Tongyun, I finished this painting a long time ago.

668
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,430
[Young Lady Fishing]

669
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,110
I know.

670
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:47,200
When I was little, I told you

671
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,850
that I wanted to raise
the most beautiful koi fish in my pond,

672
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:50,900
and only koi fish.

673
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,050
So you painted this for me.

674
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,510
Miss Shen,

675
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,480
Scholar Wang was being self-deprecating,

676
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,210
saying he's just a common carp,

677
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,360
unworthy of being caught by you.

678
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:02,530
[Soothing as Gentle Wind]

679
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,460
Ren is always so modest.

680
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,420
He became a scholar at such a young age,

681
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,570
opened a painting shop to support himself,

682
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:10,860
and even helps poor students

683
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,790
by selling their paintings.

684
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:12,150
[Soothing as Gentle Wind]

685
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,370
If he's just a common carp,

686
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,570
then there are no koi fish in this world.

687
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,960
So you're well aware of
Scholar Wang's virtues,

688
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,660
Miss Shen.

689
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:22,660
What do you mean by that, Marriage Broker Shi?

690
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,250
In the girl's basket,

00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:24,420
[Young Lady Fishing]

692
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,220
there's already

693
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,260
a common carp that surpasses
all koi fish in the world,

694
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,160
yet she's determined to catch a koi fish.

695
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:33,840
Isn't this a perfect example of
clinging to an illusion?

696
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,200
Marriage Broker Shi.

697
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,970
Are you here just to mock me?

Marriage Broker Shi means no harm.

701
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:44,310
I specifically invited her
to propose marriage to you.

702
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,230
I will cherish you
for the rest of my life,

703
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,770
as long as you don't mind my plain looks.

704

705
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,860
I know you have deep feelings for me.

00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,330
No buts.

He knows your heart

709
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,760
and understands your every emotion.

739
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,450
I'm delighted to see you

740
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,450
and I'm swept away by you.

741
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,100
General Li.

742
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,580
You're quite remarkable.

743
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,400
Miss Shen loves calligraphy and paintings.

744
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,030
Do you like this painting, General Li?

745
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,980
The artist is unknown.

746
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,460
The mounting is crude.

747
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,640
How dare someone show this

748
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,170
to offend Miss Shen's eyes?

749
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,530
You...

750
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:53,730
Marriage Broker Shi, let's leave.

751
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,880
Miss Shen.

752
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,810
A good marriage requires
mutual appreciation.

753
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,370
Scholar Wang appreciates your worth,

754
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,700
and you understand his.

755
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,650
Just now when I was speaking,

756
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,140
you were clearly moved.

757
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,470
Don't waver just because

758
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,730
you're attracted to someone else's looks.

759
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:18,050
Who can stay handsome and young forever?

760
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,790
One day, everyone's looks will fade.

761
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:22,850
When that time comes, Miss Shen,

762
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,710
what will sustain your marriage?

763
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:28,420
Miss Shen, please think carefully.

764
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:39,590
Marriage Broker Shi,
you and Ren should go back first.

765
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,260
Marriage Broker Shi.

766
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,800
I've done my best,

767
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,130
so I won't have any regrets.

768
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,620
As long as Tongyun is happy,

769
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,030
that's all that matters. Let's go now.

770
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:49,580
Let's go.

771
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,540
Take care. We won't see you out.

772
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,570
Did I give you too little to do?

773
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,770
Why do you have time to stare at me?

774
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:02,800
Please don't blame me, Master.

775
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,830
It was just a coincidence.

776
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:06,110
I happened to see Marriage Broker Deng
bring someone over.

777
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,280
This Li Ang, judging by his looks alone,

778
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,940
does seem quite presentable.

779
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,260
Master,

780
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,260
Ms. Li asked me to check
if you've had enough fun yet.

781
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,650
She suggests you find an excuse
to say you're all better soon.

782
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,679
If you keep pretending, it won't end well.

783
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,170
If Miss Shi finds out

784
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,590
that your illness is fake,

785
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,080
it might spark a...

786
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:28,139
a bloodbath...

787
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:30,900
What bloodbath?

788
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,159
It's all because of your damn mouth.

789
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,530
The bloodbath is here.

790
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,030
Ke.

791
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,460
The situation doesn't look good,

792
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,320
bye!

793
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,440
Ke.

794
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:54,960
Ke.

795
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,380
You can hit me or scold me,

796
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,010
I'll accept all the blame.

797
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,400
Liar.

798
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,200
I even felt guilty toward you

799
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,700
and got angry at
my brothers because of you,

800
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,000
but you never had amnesia at all!

801
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,540
You...

802
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,210
Brother Lu,

803
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,570
maybe let go of my hand first?

804
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,150
Wait.

805
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,070
If you remember everything,

806
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,880
then why did you hold my hand?

807
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:25,980
And hang out alone with me in a room?

808
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,920
You liar, liar, liar!

809
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,600
-You didn't forget anything!
-Ke, listen to me.

810
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,020
The poisoning was real,

811
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,220
but it wasn't severe.

812
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,700
I don't want to see you again.

813
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,540
Ke.

814
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:41,940
Wait a moment.

815
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:43,790
I know something

816
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,860
that can definitely help you.

817
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,570
Go away. I don't want to hear it.

818
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:47,230
Li Ang,

819
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:49,690
the Li Ang that Ms. Deng brought,

820
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:50,660
I know him well.

821
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,770
I promise to help you solve

822
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,070
your current problem easily.

823
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,800
I'll also help arrange
Shen Tongyun's marriage.

824
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,690
I just hope you can forgive me, Ke.

825
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,040
Say it or not, it's up to you.

826
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,800
Even if you tell me,
I might not forgive you.

827
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,930
I'll tell you. I'll tell you right now.

828
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:14,000
Go ahead then. I'm listening.

829
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:22,820
You swear it's true?

830
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,130
Absolutely true.

831
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:29,840
So, Ke, will you forgive me?

832
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,220
Who says I'll forgive you?

833
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,030
After I've arranged Miss Shen's marriage,

834
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,800
we can discuss our grievances.

[Soothing as Gentle Wind]

836
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,580
This is wonderful,

837
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,880
Miss Shen.

838
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:49,090
Since you two are so fond of each other,

839
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,750
and tomorrow happens to be
an auspicious day,

840
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,670
I'll personally deliver the
Information Cards to your homes.

841
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,870
Miss Shen, what do you think?

842
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,130
Excuse me,

843
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,450
Ms. Deng, what did you just say?

844
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:13,100
This is a good match,
it shouldn't be delayed.

845
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:17,170
Why don't I exchange Information Cards
for you two tomorrow?

846
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,190
Marriage Broker Deng,

847
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:21,470
I think there's no need to rush.

848
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,840
General Li and I have just met,

849
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:26,190
and I don't know his temperament yet.

850
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,520
In my opinion,

851
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,310
we should get to know
each other better first,

852
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:31,570
before discussing this matter further.

In that case,

856
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:38,680
I'll arrange

857
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,250
another meeting for you two.

858
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,380
How does that sound?

859
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,260
That would be appreciated, Ms. Deng.

860
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,450
It's no trouble,

861
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:45,690

Please slow down.

870
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,360
They came out so quickly.

871
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,060
Seems like Shen Tongyun
didn't ask them to stay.

872
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,080
The match isn't made yet.

873
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,870
Scholar Wang still has a chance.

this marriage proposal.

She won't even accept
the Information Card now.

00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,270
you two don't know each other well enough?

894
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:59,780
Then we'll find opportunities for you
to get better acquainted.

That's right. You remembered correctly.

that he often chats with
Miss Shen at Carefree Restaurant.

Then I'll go with you.

923
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,350
Don't make trouble.

924
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,240
I've got important work to do.

925
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,430
[Carefree Restaurant]

926
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:10,970
Come, have some tea.

927
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,590
You two are finally meeting again.

928
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,280
Since our last meeting,

929
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,530
I haven't been able to forget Miss Shen.

930
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,710
General Li, you flatter me.

931
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,950
I think General Li is brave and refined,

932
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:23,230
a handsome gentleman.

933
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,410
Come, have some tea.

934
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,880
Miss Shen, so this is where you are.

935
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,420
Scholar Wang was just
hoping to invite you for tea.

936
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,150
What a fortunate coincidence.

937
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,930
Why don't we all sit together?

938
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:42,900
What does General Li think about this?

939
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,600
Shi Fa'ke.

940
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:57,450
I suggest you give up early,

941
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,320
or when the match fails,

942
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,710
how will you and your client save face?

943
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,480
Marriage Broker Deng, you worry too much.

944
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,770
As a marriage broker,

945
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,920
as long as my client finds a good match,

946
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,310
there's nothing to be ashamed about.

947
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,390
Making a hundred visits

948
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,920
to arrange one successful marriage

949
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,520
is still a worthy endeavour.

950
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,680
As for my client,

951
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,690
being devoted and persistent
toward someone they like

952
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:22,620
is nothing to be ashamed of either.

953
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,760
I wonder what General Li

954
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,920
likes to do for entertainment?

955
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,300
I am a military man,

956
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:33,390
and usually...

957
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,340
Although General Li is a military man,

958
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,170
he also enjoys reading
poetry and literature,

959
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,800
and appreciating
paintings and calligraphy.

960
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,700
General Li and I share the same interests?

961
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,550
Indeed.

962
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,520
Which artist's paintings
does General Li admire?

963
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,550
The most renowned in the capital

964
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,280
are the works of Mr. Lin Yuan.

965
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,370
I'm quite fond of his paintings.

966
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,320
So what do you think

967
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:01,970
is special about Mr. Lin Yuan's paintings?

968
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,850
Which of his works do you admire the most?

969
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,950
I like all of his works.

970
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,700
May I ask which of his paintings

971
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,700
you have in your collection at home?

972
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,870
I don't have any in my collection.

973
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:20,340
Our Scholar Wang runs a painting shop,

974
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:23,440
he's quite knowledgeable
about these paintings, isn't he?

975
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,310
Not at all.

976
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:25,780
My humble painting shop

977
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:28,310
only sells works
from lesser-known artists.

978
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,880
Though they're not famous yet,

979
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,100
they all have distinctive personal styles.

980
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,340
Some are bold and powerful,

981
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,070
others are serene and elegant.

982
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:35,960
As for me,

983
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:38,170
I particularly favor
the works of Gushan Sou.

984
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:40,440
Mr. Lin Yuan's paintings
are indeed excellent

985
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,660
and highly sought after.

986
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,280
But I always feel his paintings

987
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,480
lack a certain warmth of everyday life.

988
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,280
He seems distant from us.

989
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,660
So,

990
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:51,020
I also prefer the works of Mr. Gushan.

991
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,570
Even friends need to
share common interests,

992
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:57,730
all the more so for husband and wife,

993
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,010
with hearts that beat as one,

994
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,810
only then can the marriage last.

995
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,000
Waiter!

996
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,210
Why is it taking so long to serve the tea?

997
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:08,660
Tea's here.

998
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,380
Hurry up!

999
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:14,480
Sir, your tea.

1000
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:18,350
Sir, please forgive me.

1001
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:19,380
Please forgive me, sir.

1002
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,380
I'm so sorry, sir.

1003
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,240
Forgive me.

1004
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,900
I'll clean this up right away.

1005
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:39,940
It's not easy making a living out here.

1006
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,200
Your legs were shaking when serving tea.

1007
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,200
I suspect your boss
has been docking your pay.

1008
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,260
You probably don't get enough to eat.

1009
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,500
Take this to buy yourself some food.

1010
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,500
Thank you, sir.

1011
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,860
Sir, thank you.

1012
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,800
Thank you, sir.

1013
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:04,480
Miss Shen, did you see that?

1014
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:05,880
Our General Li

1015
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,440
is not only accomplished
in both civil and military affairs,

1016
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,960
but also generous and kind-hearted.

1017
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:12,930
He's a perfect match.

1018
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,360
Unlike certain people

1019
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,090
who always have ulterior motives,

1020
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:20,480
like a frog dreaming of
marrying a princess.

1021
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,330
You!

1022
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:22,580
What did I say?

1023
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,830
General Li truly has great presence.

1024
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,470
I am very pleased.

1025
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:28,690
That's wonderful!

1026
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,500
Since that's the case,

1027
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:32,700
tomorrow happens to be the 9th,

1028
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,720
a good day for discussing marriage.

1029
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,640
Why don't I deliver the documents and
Information Cards tomorrow,

1030
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,500
so your marriage can be confirmed early?

1031
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,030
Miss Shen, what do you think?

1032
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:45,740
Very well.

1033
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:47,430
I'll go back and inform my father.

1034
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:48,340
Okay.

1035
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,340
Thank you, Ms. Deng.

1036
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,450
It's nothing.

1037
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:57,880
Tongyun, let me walk you out.

1038
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:01,500
Marriage Broker Shi, goodbye.

1039
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,120
You can talk all you want,

1040
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:06,280
but what good will it do?

1041
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,740
Tomorrow I'll deliver
the Information Cards.

1042
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,200
Only half a day remains.

1043
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:11,740
Whatever you're planning to do,

1044
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,190
I'm afraid it's too late.

1045
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,500
As long as Ms. Deng acts

1046
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,530
in good conscience, I have nothing to say.

1047
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:30,900
Brother Lu.

1048
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,250
That Li Ang came well-prepared.

1049
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:33,680
Our tea-spilling plan failed.

1050
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,990
Ms. Deng will deliver
the Information Cards tomorrow.

1051
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:36,990
What should we do?

1052
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:37,940
Don't worry, Ke.

1053
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,160
First, stop Miss Shen from leaving.

1054
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,360
Bring her back to watch a show.

1055
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,280
This time, I'll handle it myself.

1056
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:43,500
I'll guarantee your success.
