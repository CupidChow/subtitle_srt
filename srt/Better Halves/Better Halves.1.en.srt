00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,520
Why are you trying to compete with me?

186
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,590
Can it be sold?

187
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,940
Painting is meant to be appreciated.

188
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,080
Of course,
it can be sold to the fated one.

189
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,140
200 taels at least.

190
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,430
300 taels.

191
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,560
500 taels.

192
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,230
500 taels?

193
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,920
What? You want to buy the painting too?

194
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,090
Although Mr. Lin Yuan's
paintings are rare,

195
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,840
if you increase the price
to acquire one simply due to his fame,

196
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,800
young ladies,

197
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,630
you're being too impulsive.

198
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,230
You don't even know
what I'm going to do with it.

199
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,980
You only know how to cause trouble for me.

200
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,630
If no one increases the price,

201
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,470
I'll...

202
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,610
800 taels.

203
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,580
I'll pay in cash. I won't delay it.

204
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,430
Ms. Li.

205
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,600
She hasn't completed
any matchmaking cases this month.

206
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,400
She won't be able to pay any cash.

207
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,760
Let me do it.

208
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,720
He Ketian, are you bullying me
because I don't have cash?

209
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,780
Shi Fa'ke, you'll piss me off one day.

210
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,550
Pan'er.

211
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,980
Let's go settle the bill.

212
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,650
Okay.

213
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,630
My painting.

214
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,800
Miss, is there anything else?

215
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,220
I do have something urgent.

216
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,350
Although I lost my beloved painting,

217
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,370
I can't lose the one who can help me.

218
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,530
What do you mean?

219
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,580
Young Master, you look unfamiliar.

220
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,240
I know most of the young masters

221
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,670
in the capital.

222
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,690
But I have never seen you.

223
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,840
I just arrived in the capital today.

224
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,160
You just arrived?

225
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,310
That's great.

226
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,320
Young Master, which family are you
considering for a marriage alliance?

227
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,910
We just met today.

228
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,750
We are not close enough
to talk about matchmaking.

229
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,080
If I want to get married,

230
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,550
I will go visit
the Official Matchmaking Agency.

231
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,270
I have something personal to do.

232
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,670
Allow me to take my leave.

233
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,180
Young Master, wait.

234
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,200
You seemed to be here for Mr. Lin Yuan.

235
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,950
But why didn't you
participate when my friend and I

236
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,230
were competing just now?

237
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,790
A gentleman won't take what others love.

238
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,920
Since you liked that painting so much,

239
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,290
I couldn't just take it for myself.

240
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,370
I...

241
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,950
It seems that he
has no money to buy the painting.

242
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,000
But he's full of excuses,
saying he couldn't act unilaterally.

243
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,390
I didn't expect
that with his outstanding looks,

244
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,220
he's so vain and proud.

245
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:44,650
Wait.

246
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,690
He just said he's going to visit
the Official Matchmaking Agency.

247
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,680
It seems that he
really wants to get married.

248
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,830
I will win him over today.

249
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,090
Wait.

250
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,260
Miss, what do you want?

251
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,860
Your forehead is reddish.

252
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,600
Your eyes are filled with affection.

253
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,000
I guess you're
inviting guests to a dinner.

254
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,150
Why don't I treat you to a meal

255
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,930
to thank you for inviting me
to appreciate the painting?

256
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,130
We just met by chance.

257
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,670
No need to dine together.

258
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,050
Don't be polite.

259
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,770
Eating with me is
nothing but a gain for you.

260
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,920
Maybe I can help you find someone.

261
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,760
You and I were just socializing.

262
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,490
How did you know
I was looking for someone?

263
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,880
It's the first time we've met.​​

264
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,390
You were quite guarded against me.

265
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,400
But when you heard
my mother was the Chief Matchmaker,

266
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,930
you became nice to me.

267
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,870
You're not in a hurry to go
to the Official Matchmaking Agency

268
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,320
but you said you would be there
in the future.

269
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,670
You were not in a hurry to talk to me,

270
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,480
but you treated me politely.

271
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,000
So you're not in a rush
to marry someone you already love,

272
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,750
but rather, you're looking
for the person you're going to marry.

273
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,570
The agency has the list
of all men and women in the capital,

274
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,900
including the unmarried and the married.

275
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,170
Young man,

276
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,330
it won't be a loss for you to eat with me.

277
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,220
You just said

278
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,040
all men and women in the capital?

279
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,800
Of course.

280
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,600
In that case,

281
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,680
I should treat you to dinner.

282
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,620
How about having dinner here?

283
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,330
Here?

284
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,790
Fine.

285
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,010
Looks like you've made preparations,

286
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:15,810
so you know they
serve banquets at Xibao Pavilion.

287
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,430
Ms. Li, I'm going to dine here.

288
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,330
Okay, I'll get ready.

289
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,860
As an outsider,

290
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,350
does he know that meals
at Xibao Pavilion are quite expensive?

291
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,120
He might not be able to afford them
even if he sold himself.

292
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,160
So luxurious?

293
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,000
They're only ordinary things
and not hard to get.

294
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,990
I'll see how he'll pay later.

295
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,800
I think we should share names

296
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,280
and get to know each other.

297
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,750
Fa'ke means cutting
wood for an axe handle.

298
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,320
"To cut wood for an axe handle,

299
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,320
you need an axe.

300
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,210
To marry a wife,

301
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,050
you need a matchmaker."

302
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,430
You're right.

303
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,620
Young Master, you are so cultured.

304
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,130
Wait.

305
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,510
I only said it once.

306
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,940
And you remember it all?

307
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,540
Are all marriage brokers so eloquent?

308
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:21,960
You flatter me.

309
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,860
You already know my name,

310
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,950
but I don't know your name

311
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,340
and where you're from.

312
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,570
I'm Lu Chi.

313
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,160
"Lu" means above ground. My name
implies someday I'll rise to prominence.

314
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,520
[Lu Chi]

315
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:39,770
Mr. Lu,

316
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,880
you're articulate and good
at calligraphy and painting.

317
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,930
You're a rare man in the capital.

318
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,140
I wonder who you're looking for.

319
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,430
She's cute with a round face.

320
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,670
She should be coming of age now.

321
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,080
Girls who have come of age

322
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,120
will be categorized
as "eligible for marriage".

323
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,720
Their family background and certain
situations will be illustrated.

324
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,700
It's convenient for selecting

325
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,400
the right spouse for them.

326
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,150
Wait.

327
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,660
You mean

328
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,510
girls in the capital get married early?

329
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,580
Not only girls but boys too.

330
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,820
The capital is prosperous.
People prefer early marriage.

331
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,520
Common families
tend to seek a son-in-law early,

332
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,740
so girls get married early.

333
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,010
There are exceptions for rich families.

334
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:14,930
Just like me.

335
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,680
It's time to get married
when I've come of age.

336
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,550
But I need to inherit the family business.

337
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,420
My family loves me so much,

338
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,690
so they don't rush me.

339
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,590
She was also from a wealthy family.

340
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,830
She had the fragrance of cake

341
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,060
and a precious gold badge.

342
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,360
He knows little about that girl.

343
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,130
But he remembers
that she was from a wealthy family.

344
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,130
I don't think he loves her very much.

345
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,350
Forget it. Since he has that idea,

346
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,750
I can be his matchmaker.

347
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,340
Miss.

348
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,900
What do you mean by that smile?

349
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,690
I'm trying to figure out
a way to help you.

350
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,420
After we finish the meal,

351
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,700
let me show you around.

352
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,440
If you find somewhere familiar,

353
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,800
I'll select those from nearby families

354
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,270
who match her
in appearance, age, and social status,

355
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,480
and take you to meet her.

356
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,940
Good. Let's go.

357
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,280
Young Master.

358
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
Pan'er.

359
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,290
I'm the one who wanted to treat Mr. Lu.

360
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,390
I'll pay for the meal this time.

361
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,070
Besides,

362
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,220
prepare a proper outfit for him.

363
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,520
I'll pay for that too.

364
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,240

at calligraphy and painting.

550
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:45,100
You'll know that I'm not boasting.

551
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,800
Besides, he may be a foreigner,

552
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,160
but I've asked around.

553
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,400
He has no burden at home.

554
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,110
Young Master. Please have some water.

555
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,040
I'm not thirsty.

556
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,290
Let me know if you need anything.

557
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,780
Take a look, right?

558
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,320
Miss Shi.

559
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,240
Miss Wu looks totally different

560
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,640
from the person I've been looking for.

561
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,720
I'm afraid you've found the wrong person.

562
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,980
I'll take my leave now.

563
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:17,860
Wait, Young Master.

564
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,880
Since you're here, just take it easy.

565
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,460
Why don't you talk to me... my lady more?

566
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,570
Some people, one glance tells you
you're not meant to connect.

567
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:26,710
Well, this...

568
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,410
This...

569
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,200
What are you doing?

570
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,600
Girls change a lot when they grow up.

571
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,410
Talk more.

572
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,700
Get to know her personality.

573
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,680
Miss Shi!

574
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,030
Miss Shi!

575
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:39,590
I'm very satisfied with
the young master you brought here.

576
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:43,200
But Madam is not at home.

577
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,660
Can you wait for a while

578
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,120
until Madam comes
back for a formal blind date?

579
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,430
Is this a blind date?

580
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,510
When did I say I wanted a blind date?

581
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,680
Don't worry.

582
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,930
We'll talk about it
after I've finished the main deal.

583
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,440
Young Master. Don't be angry.

584
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,760
Why don't you stay for dinner?

585
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,360
The fresh fish our family
makes is the most delicious.

586
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,490
At this time, there are
no fresh fish available for sale.

587
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:14,920
This crunchy candy

588
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,620
has the most generous use of sugar
and oil among all the He's desserts.

589
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,620
The two siblings from the He family
have never been willing to sell me more.

590
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,370
One said eating
too much would hurt my teeth.

591
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,120
The other said I would
gain weight after eating too much.

592
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,960
Miss Wu, you're so slim.

593
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,910
It shows that the He siblings lied to me.

594
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,060
They must have been lying to you.

595
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,280
The crunchy candy is delicious.

596
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,450
It's impossible to make you gain weight.

597
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,180
Impossible.

598
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,860
I don't know if they lied to me.

599
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:37,290
But you two

600
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,730
shouldn't lie to me.

601
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,150
You two exchanged your clothes

602
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,230
and your identities

603
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,230
to deceive me, the marriage broker?

604
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,510
Nonsense!

605
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:49,490
This lady,

606
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,980
every time you talked,

607
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,800
you would look at this maid next to you,

608
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,240
as if you needed her permission

609
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,380
to speak.

610
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,090
As the legitimate eldest daughter,

611
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,090
you called your mother Madam

612
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,170
instead of calling her "Mother".

613
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,690
Look at your hands.

614
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:06,050
They have thick bones and rough skin.

615
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:08,960
It can't be like this without more
than ten years of hard work.

616
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,880
And you know

617
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,970
if there are fresh fish in this season.

618
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,030
Look at your hands.

619
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,060
They are so tender.

620
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,660
Do I need to expose the truth?

621
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:16,730

624
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,320
You are Miss Wu.

625
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,610
Let me tell you.

626
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,030
I'm going back
to the Official Matchmaking Agency

627
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,540
and write you all in the blacklist.

628
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,550
I'm afraid no one would

629
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,790
matchmake for you in a few years.

630
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,420
My lady, what should we do?

631
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,320
Well.

632
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:29,800

Liar.

640
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,600
I was just looking for someone,
but you took me on a blind date.

00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,630
Besides,

00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,400
how is Miss Wu
similar to the person I'm looking for?

644
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,070
You said the person you're looking
for is from a wealthy family

645
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,200
and has a round face.

646
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,400

and come from a wealthy family?

648
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,300
As for the blind date,

649
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,370
I was just praising you.

650
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,240
They misunderstood it.

651
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,510
You're blaming me for that?

652
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,540
You have a round face too.

653
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,960
Your attire is also elegant and luxurious.

654
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,220
Then you're also the one I'm looking for?

655
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,480
Ridiculous.

656
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,670
My face is peach-shaped, Okay?

657
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,300
I think you just dislike Miss Wu

658

because she's not beautiful enough.

659
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,010

00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:16,930
Wait.

661
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,460
Do you know that Xibao Pavilion
is incredibly expensive?

662
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,440
Whether it's the food, drinks,
or famous paintings and calligraphy.

663
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,230
So what?

664
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,050
So what?

665
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,240
Fine, I won't argue with you about this.

666
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,500
I just want to tell you

667
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,870
to be a decent man.

668
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,120
It's not shameful to have no money.

669
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,880
Caring too much
about your dignity will only harm you.

670
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,480
I agree with you.

671
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,680
I was wrong.

672
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,920
I helped you out of kindness.

00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,380
How dare you call me a liar?

674
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,320
Fine, I'll go back
to the Official Matchmaking Agency

675
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,700
and write you in the blacklist.

676

at the Official Matchmaking Agency?

Of course.

at changing your attitude.

attend my coming-of-age ceremony.

1096
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:47,600
I know.

1097
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,630
To be happy every year,
every month, every day, every hour,

1098
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:52,030
and every moment, right?

1099
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,100
And to have me with you.

1100
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:58,590
Not only you,
Ketian has to be with me too.

1101
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:00,820
I will

1102
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,960
give this pig to Ketian.

1103
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:04,000
As for the rest,

1104
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,840
I'll send them to the ladies.

1105
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:08,140
Fa'ke, look.

1106
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,710
You've come of age.

1107
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,330
It's time to think about marriage.

1108
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:15,570
Kexian,

1109
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,630
you should know

1110
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:19,230
I'm the heir
to the No.1 matchmaker in the world.

1111
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:20,510
I haven't achieved my career.

1112
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,240
How can I think about marriage?

1113
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,280
Besides...

1114
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:27,440
Mother taught me
to keep my promise since I was young.

1115
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:30,110
I promised to marry a beggar boy.

1116
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:31,100
Kexian.

1117
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:33,020
You'd better not know.

1118
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,540
It's too hot. My makeup is messed up.

1119
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,200
Kexian, please wait
for me in the front hall.

1120
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,730
I need to touch up my makeup.

1121
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:43,270
My mother will scold me

1122
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:44,750
when she sees me like this.

1123
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:47,970
Okay, I'll wait for you in the front hall.

1124
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,480
The coming-of-age ceremony
is about to begin.

1125
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,610
I'm afraid you don't have enough time.

1126
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:21,910
You...

1127
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:24,800
Here.

1128
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:29,340
Your lipstick is smudged.

1129
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:31,010
Are you going
to show up with a smeared face

1130
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:32,870
for the coming-of-age ceremony?

1131
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:36,080
Oh no. Where is the mirror?
