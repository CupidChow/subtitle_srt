Tell me quickly,

4
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:46,440
am I about to have a senior sister-in-law?

5
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,330
Alright, let's not talk about this now.

6
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,990
I heard you've been
frequently leaving the palace lately.

7
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,050
Has Marquis Wu'an made any new moves?

8
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,600
No.

9
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,190
I met an interesting person.

10
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,200
It must be a young lady.

It seems

we don't know
whose wedding we'll be celebrating first.

14

That's not right.

Today is the last day

Are you the person in charge?

Would it be possible
for me to meet Mr. Lin Yuan?

28
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,760

that this Miss truly comes here every day.

How could you bring
someone here without permission?

62

sometimes you were
with joy and excitement,

63
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,710
sometimes with melancholy.

64
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,750

from what you were worried about.

You asked
the exact same questions as I did.

I have something to discuss with you.

Now he suddenly
wants to hold an exhibition

141

142

Something's not right about this,

146
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,850
Isn't this exactly what you call fate?

147
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,830
I'm a matchmaker,

148
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,640

he's the one you care about,

so it's understandable that you trust him.

156
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,360

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,820
and I have someone I care about too.

158
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,470
Mr. Lin Yuan and I
are already connected by fate.

I am indeed the Marquis Wu'an.

If they all knew who I really am,

211

they would surely assume

212

After that argument just now,

to continue staying there, wouldn't it?

00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,070
is just a matter of time.

740
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,970
What's the other news?

741
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,200
The second is

742
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:32,770
Lu Chi has departed for Mount Qianya.

743
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,360
[Mount Qianya]

744
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,220
Good.

745
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:39,630
Everything is in my plan.

746
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,740
As long as I can catch Lu Chi's weakness

747
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:45,520
and control Shi Fa'ke,

748
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:47,010
if I ask him to go east,

749
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,750
he wouldn't dare to go west.

750
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:51,580
I'm going to catch Shi Fa'ke now.

751
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,490
Go now.

752
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:52,990
Yes.

753
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,140
Lu.

754
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,620
Lu.

755
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,520
Ke.

756
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,890
Something terrible has happened!

757
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,470
Uncle, Aunt!

758
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,070
There's a squad of soldiers outside

759
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:21,130
saying they're here to arrest Fa'ke.

760
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:22,500
Me?

761
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,550
The Military Headquarters
has been ordered to arrest Shi Fa'ke.

762
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,410
Hand over Shi Fa'ke immediately.

763
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,130
I am Shi Fa'ke.

764
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:33,750
Ke!

765
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,240
What crime has my daughter committed?

766
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,040
How dare you barge in
and arrest people like this?

767
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,260
Do you have an arrest warrant?

768
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,510
Breaking into a private home,
according to the law...

769
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,040
Everyone else, stand back!

770
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,300
Weapons don't discriminate.

771
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,720
It would be unfortunate
if someone got hurt.

772
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,760
Let me tell you this.

773
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,950
You're not taking my daughter away today.

774
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:50,210
I don't care what authority you represent,

775
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:51,510
you're not taking Ke away today.

776
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,370
Enough talk!

777
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:53,490
Take her away!

778
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,000
-Yes.
-Yes.

779
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,400
You...

780
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:54,760
Move aside!

781
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,740
What are you doing?

782
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,270
-Move!
-What are you doing?

783
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:58,970
What are you doing?

784
00:40:58,970 --> 00:40:59,520
Don't be so disrespectful!

785
00:40:59,520 --> 00:40:59,970
Move aside!

786
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:00,690
Don't go too far! Step back!

787
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:01,520
What do you think you're doing?

788
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,210
Stop!

789
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:02,690
Get out of the way!

790
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:03,170
Stop!

791
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:06,960
I'll go with you.

792
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:07,920
Ke!

793
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:09,610
No, you can't! Don't!

794
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,170
Ke, are you sure about this?

795
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,610
I have nothing to hide.

796
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,400
I've done nothing wrong.

797
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,930
They'll have to release me
sooner or later.

798
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:16,600
Fa'ke!

799
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:19,710
-Let's go.
-Ke.

800
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:20,270
Ke.

801
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,330
-Ke.
-Ke.

802
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,140
-Aunt.
-Madam.

803
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:23,790
Mother.

804
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,610
Father, Mother.

805
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,930
Miss Qiyue, Qin'er.

806
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,610
We'll find a way to rescue Ke.

807
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:30,240
Chongshan, let's go.

808
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:31,610
Wait.

809
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:34,220
Xianxian, Chongshan, let me come with you.

810
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:34,810
Alright.

811
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,140
Greetings, Master.

812
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:04,250
This Marquis Wu'an has gone too far.

813
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:05,920
Chi.

814
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,710
The enemy forces greatly outnumber ours.

815
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:09,270
Our recent engagements with them

816
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:10,700
have resulted in heavy casualties.

817
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,500
Please punish me for my failure.

818
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,360
You've worked hard.

819
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:19,230
This isn't your fault.

820
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,780
Li Ang is leading their troops this time,

821
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:24,070
a stubborn and brutal man.

822
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,310
At least you've engaged with them

823
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,840
and learned about their situation,

824
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,190
which will be very beneficial
for our future battles.

825
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,670
They've sent their elite troops

826
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:32,880
to cut off the capital's retreat route.

827
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,590
Perfect,

828
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,350
we'll make sure they never return,

829
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:38,740
and free the capital from any concerns.

830
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:41,080
Chi, you have a plan?

831
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,710
Officers, attention!

832
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:44,510
Yes, Sir!

833
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,530
Our forces are outnumbered,

834
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,310
a direct confrontation
would surely lead to defeat,

835
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:52,170
so we must use
Mount Qianya's terrain to our advantage.

836
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,230
Send out the order:

837
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,910
immediately send men
down the mountain with great fanfare,

838
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:56,050
buying and stockpiling provisions,

839
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:58,660
carrying war drums
and banners, shouting loudly,

840
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,280
making the enemy believe
we have many troops and ample supplies.

841
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,390
Before their supplies arrive,

842
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,050
they won't dare to make any rash moves.

843
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:05,200
Once their supplies arrive,

844
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,400
we'll engage them in a war of attrition,

845
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,510
even if we can't defeat them,
we'll wear them down.

846
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,040
But I'm worried

847
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:14,220
that if this drags on too long,

848
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,760
we might not be able to hold out.

849
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,540
Don't worry,

850
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:18,510
we certainly won't
just sit and wait for death.

851
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:19,260
Zhuxi,

852
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,640
I have a plan now

853
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:25,010
that will dampen their spirits.
