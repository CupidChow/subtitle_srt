[Episode 22]

3
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,000
Once the supplies arrive,

4
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,979
we'll have a long battle with them.

5
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,550
Even if we can't defeat them,

6
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,150
we'll have to wear them down.

7
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,070
But I'm worried that

8
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,220
if this lasts too long,

9
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,870
we might not be able to hang on.

10
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,820
Don't worry.

11
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,550
We certainly won't just sit there
waiting for death.

12
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,440
Zhuxi.

13
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,020
I've just thought of a plan

14
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,980
that can dampen their spirits.

15
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,460
Our army is greatly outnumbered.

16
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,470
We need to fully utilize

17
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,940
the terrain advantages of Mount Qianya.

18
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,110
The eastern terrain is flat,

19
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:12,790
which is unfavorable for us.

20
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,460
Hurry up!

21
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,480
Take a team and set up an ambush here.

22
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,090
Shoot the arrows!

23
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,150
Pretend to attack.

24
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,380
Then just fake a retreat from a defeat

25
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,640
and lure them beneath the western cliff.

26
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,770
Retreat!

27
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:34,790
Chase them!

28
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,460
Yes!

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,200
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

30
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,500
The rest of you
should fight the enmey with me

31
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,230
and set up an ambush
at the western mountain pass.

32
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,690
Shoot!

33
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:21,910
Shoot the arrows!

34
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,510
Everyone,
aim carefully and shoot the arrows!

35
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,780
Retreat! Hurry up!

36
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,520
Chi.

37
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,920
Ke has been arrested.

38
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,240
Is there no justice in the capital now?

39
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,120
I'm going to reason with them.

40
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,460
Let's go!

41
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,140
Kexian, calm down.

42
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,790
They arrested her without any evidence.

43
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,490
Do you think they'll listen to the reason?

44
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,620
I've sent a letter to Chief about this.

45
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,740
However,

46
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,180
the journey is long.

47
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,230
In the Military Headquarters Prison,

48
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,490
I don't know whether Ke can hang in there.

49
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,600
I'm going to
the Military Headquarters now.

50
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,840
If they dare to give Ke a hard time,

51
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,890
I'll take her out of there forcibly.

52
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,050
-Calm down.
-Xianxian!

53
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,630
Your parents and Qin'er are still at home.

54
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,360
If you're so reckless,
not only will you be unable to save her,

55
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,080
but you'll also get yourself into trouble.

56
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,409
Won't that make everyone worry about you?

57
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:49,460
Everyone, please calm down.

58
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,790
Let's think clearly first.

59
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,220
They clearly came prepared,

60
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,480
and they outnumber us.

61
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,880
We can't use force.
We can only use our wits.

62
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,159
The Military Headquarters
is abusing its power like this.

63
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,710
But they still have to be reasonable.

64
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,820
If we can also put some pressure on them,

65
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,660
perhaps there's still hope.

66
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,370
Even if Ke can't be released,

67
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,710
we can at least ensure
that her life won't be in danger.

68
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,570
How about this?

69
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,140
I'll go to the magistrate's office
to see Lord Zheng

70
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,240
and ask him to smooth things out
at the Military Headquarters.

71
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,150
That's a good idea.

72
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:15,830
Let's go.

73
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:16,630
That's not enough.

74
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,880
That lieutenant said
he came here under the imperial decree.

75
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,490
If someone really gave the order,

76
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,840
I'm afraid even the magistrate's office
has no authority to intervene.

77
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,260
What should we do then?

78
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,870
If we can gather

79
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,470
all of Ke's former clients

80
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,030
and ask them
to intercede for her together,

81
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,960
Ke might be able to be released

82
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,240
from the Military Headquarters Prison.

83
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,280
We need someone with prestige

84
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,770
to help us now.

85
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:39,930
Miss Cheng.

86
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,860
Miss Cheng from Jiangning's Dream

87
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,430
is His Majesty's sworn sister.

88
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,310
In addition,

89
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,520
Xu Ao,
Commander of the Imperial Cavalry Bureau,

90
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,760
is His Majesty's internal official.

91
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,260
One of them
is a member of the imperial family,

92
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,450
while the other
is a high-ranking official.

93
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,510
If they intervene,

94
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,850
they can surely protect Ke
from suffering in prison.

95
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,630
Okay. I'll go find Lord Xu.

96
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,650
Then Chongshan and I will
go find Miss Cheng.

97
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,890
I'll go prepare some money.

98
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,390
Just let me handle the bribery matters.

99
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,030
Okay.

100
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,650
Lu Yi will protect Mr. and Mrs. Shi.

101
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,080
If there's any news from Chief,

102
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,450
I'll inform you all immediately.

103
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,280
There's no time to waste.

104
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:06,750
Let's go.

105
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,310
Wait!

106
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,600
There's something we still don't know yet.

107
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,790
Who on earth did Ke offend?

108
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,750
Ke has always been pure-hearted and kind
since childhood.

109
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,350
She has made friends everywhere.

110
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,500
How could she possibly offend anyone?

111
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,350
Indeed.

112
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,640
Ke is a helpful girl

113
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,800
and is quite honey-tongued.

114
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,400
How would she offend anyone?

115
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,370
It's Marquis Wu'an.

116
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,260
What?

117
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,630
Previously,

118
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,050
Marquis Wu'an pretended to be Mr. Lin Yuan
to get close to me.

119
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,980
If Ke hadn't exposed him in time...

120
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,990
Anyway,
in terms of having a grudge against Ke,

121
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,450
he's the only person I can think of.

122
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,210
The Military Headquarters
sent people here.

123
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,950
It's probably him indeed.

124
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,330
But we have no evidence.

125
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,500
In that case,

126
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,930
Ke once embarrassed Marquis Wu'an

127
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,400
during Miss Cheng's matchmaking event.

128
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,880
Then it's probably him indeed.

129
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,740
But Marquis Wu'an has such a noble status

130
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,159
and holds military power.

131
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,409
If it's really him,

132
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,700
what should we do then?

133
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,820
Ke.

134
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,950
I'll definitely find a way to protect you.

135
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,630
Ke has been arrested by Marquis Wu'an.

136
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:12,780
What did you say?

137
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,980
Miss Cheng,

138
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,080
we're still not quite clear

139
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,590
about the reasons behind this.

140
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,980
It's just our speculation.

to arrest my sister for no reason.

whether Lu will come back to save you

226

00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,410
Open the door now!

369
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,480
-We have a grievance to report!
-Open the door!

370
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,800
-We have a grievance to report!
-Open the door!

371
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,480
Open the door!

372
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,790
-We have a grievance to report!
-Open the door!

373
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,840
Open the door!

374
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,680
Open the door!

375
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,550
Open the door now!

376
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,660
Open the door!

377
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,720
The Military Headquarters
is doing this on purpose, huh?

378
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,340
If they keep refusing to open the door,

379
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,770
there's nothing we can do.

380
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:54,690
Let's keep knocking on the door!

381
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,680
I don't believe no one will come out!

382
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,730
Open the door!

383
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,510
Open the door!

384
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,590
How dare you!

385
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,640
This is the Military Headquarters.
How dare you cause trouble here?

386
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,270
We have a grievance to report.

387
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,400
I'm Xu Ao,
Commander of the Imperial Cavalry Bureau.

388
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,170
You've detained Marriage Broker Shi Fa'ke
without evidence.

389
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,830
You must give us an explanation today.

390
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,440
Otherwise, you must release her at once!

391
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,560
We have petitions from marriage brokers
of the Official Matchmaking Agency.

392
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,630
Please release the innocent Shi Fa'ke now.

393
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,890
Shi Fa'ke is innocent!

394
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,760
Enough! Stop talking, you all!

395
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,750
My Lord.

396
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,630
You're the Commander
of the Imperial Cavalry Bureau.

397
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:30,560
I'm afraid you have no authority
over our Military Headquarters, huh?

398
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,580
Close the door!

399
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,650
You guys...

400
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,770
What should we do now?

401
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,540
I wonder

402
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,410
why they're so brazenly

403
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,780
detaining Ke.

404
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
Imperial Cavalry Bureau
and Military Headquarters

405
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,530
have separate duties

406
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,470
with no interaction.

407
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,400
And I'm not acquainted with Li Ang.

408
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,140
I'm afraid this time,

409
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:57,100
we'll have to go back
and think of another solution.

410
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,550
Anyway,

411
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,110
thank you, Lord Xu.

412
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,380
Thanks for your help, Lord Xu.

413
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,480
It looks like currently,

414
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,880
we can only find another solution.

415
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,210
Don't mention it.
This is what I should do.

416
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,520
Marriage Broker Shi
is not only everyone's friend,

417
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,780
but she also helped my wife and me before.

418
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,030
How is Ke now?

419
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,310
Has she already been...

420
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,260
That's impossible.

421
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,990
Let's not frighten ourselves.

422
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,450
We haven't received any news
from Chief yet.

423
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,650
I wonder how it's going on Mount Qianya.

424
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,450
Xianxian.

425
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,240
Stop pacing around.

426
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,500
It's making everyone anxious.

427
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,730
I'm worried.

428
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,600
Ke has lived an extravagant life
and been pampered

429
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
since childhood.

430
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,100
When has she ever suffered
like this before?

431
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,400
It's all my fault
for being useless as her eldest brother.

432
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,480
I should have stopped them

433
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,080
from taking Ke away that day.

434
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,510
Kexian.

435
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,970
Kexian.

436
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,420
Kexian, don't worry too much.

437
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,970
With all of us trying to find a solution,

438
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,460
Ke will surely be fine.

439
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,960
Mr. He, have you thought of a solution?

440
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,210
Not yet.

441
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,730
I just think

442
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,240
it's getting late now,

443
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,600
and everyone is exhausted.

444
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,940
Just go home and get some rest.

445
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,400
We can continue tomorrow.

446
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,640
Mr. He is right.

447
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,060
We'll go home now.

448
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:29,960
Let's go.

449
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,140
Chongshan.

450
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,960
[Century-old Shop]

451
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,020
Chongshan, please stay for a moment!

452
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,710
Kexian, what's the matter?

453
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,130
Chongshan.

454
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,260
I'm entrusting Ketian to you.

455
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,210
I hope
you can take good care of her for me.

456
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,040
Well...

457
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,210
Why are you

458
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,060
suddenly saying such things?

459
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,860
Ketian and Ke are equally

460
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,480
important to me.

461
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,600
To save Ke,

462
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,210
I'll do everything in my power
if there's even a glimmer of hope.

463
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,290
But I'm just worried about Ketian.

464
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,030
I'll definitely take good care of Ketian.

465
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,420
But what are you going to do?

466
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,320
Don't worry, Chongshan.

467
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,160
Please take good care of Ketian for me.

468
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,440
I'm deeply grateful.

469
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,760
I will do that.

470
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,050
Thank you, Chongshan.

471
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,210
Greetings, My Lord.

472
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,780
Why are you here to see me, Mr. He?

473
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,490
Though I'm not quite talented,

474
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,040
I still wish to work for you.

475
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,560
I hope that I can help you.

476
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,540
You'll help me?

477
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,590
What do you want to get from me?

478
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,730
[Official Deed]

479
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:22,490
He's Bakery is a century-old shop,

480
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:24,490
which is a legacy left by my parents.

481
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,480
We have over 30 branches in the capital

482
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,800
with the annual revenue
exceeding 10,000 taels.

483
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,290
Here is the title deed of He's Bakery.

484
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:33,500
I hope
you can consider my love for Ke.

485
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,370
What exactly do you mean, Mr. He?

486
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,270
My Lord.

487
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,020
Ke and I grew up together.

488
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,590
Marrying Ke has been my lifelong wish.

489
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,320
But Lu Chi,

490
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,830
with his sweet talk,

491
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,490
has bewitched Ke completely.

492
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,720
Not only did he snatch Ke from me,

493
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,920
but he has also made her end up like this.

494
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,350
Just like you,

495
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,640
I don't want him to have a happy ending.

496
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,230
So My Lord, please give me a chance

497
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,730
so that I can get Ke back.

498
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,490
Mr. He, it looks like you're angry at him
because of this woman.

499
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,240
It's rare that you're so affectionate
and loyal to her.

500
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:11,990
Alright.

501
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,080
Since you're so sincere,

502
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,460
I'm more than happy
to bring true lovers together.

503
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,650
Thank you, My Lord.

504
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,620
But I have one more request.

505
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,270
What else do you want?

506
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,610
I hope that you can allow me to see Ke.

507
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:30,180
As Ke has been pampered since childhood,

508
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,110
I wonder how she's doing in prison.

509
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,370
After meeting her,

510
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,770
I'll persuade her to give up Lu Chi

511
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,930
and let the Shi family work for you.

512
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,460
You are indeed a clever man, Mr. He.

513
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,270
Alright.

514
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:45,120
I'll grant your request.

515
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,750
Let them meet each other.

516
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,410
Thank you, My Lord.

517
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,230
Mr. He, please.

518
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,380
Mr. He, please.

519
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,730
Kexian, how did you get in here?

520
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,800
Please allow me to speak with Ke alone.

521
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,240
Of course.

522
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,590
You're Lord Marquis's honored guest.

523
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,450
We can't be disrespectful to you.

524
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,700
Let's go.

525
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,150
Ke, how are you?

526
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,760
How did you get in here?

527
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:50,200
How did you become
Lord Marquis's honored guest?

528
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,180
Have you...

529
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,680
become Marquis Wu'an's follower?

530
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,440
Lord Marquis is famous and powerful
in the imperial court.

531
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,040
A wise man submits to fate.

532
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,660
Why can't I be Lord Marquis's follower?

533
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,270
Marquis Wu'an is full of wild ambitions.

534
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,620
How could you help this villain?

535
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,570
Kexian.

536
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,170
I'm so disappointed in you.

537
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,220
Ke.

538
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,750
In my mind,

539
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,860
your safety is the most important.

540
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,280
I don't care about all the state affairs.

541
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,540
I just want to save you out of here.

542
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,130
That won't be necessary.

543
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,330
I've got used to staying in this prison.

544
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,720
I just didn't expect that you would...

545
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,220
From now on,

546
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,980
you and I are not friends anymore.

547
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,620
-Leave now! Leave!
-Ke.

548
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,480
-Leave!
-Ke.

549
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,500
Just leave!

550
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,380
Ke, listen to me!

551
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,380
-Let go of me!
-Ke!

552
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,270
Beware of eavesdroppers.

553
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,340
What?

554
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,330
Lu Chi.

555
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,460
I want you to do me a favor, Mr. He.

556
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,530
What makes you think I'll agree?

557
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:54,660
I can ask no one but you to do this favor.

558
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,080
It's about Ke.

559
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,620
What is it?

560
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,820
After I returned to Mount Qianya,

561
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,750
Ke has been targeted by Marquis Wu'an.

562
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,750
If he's in a desperate situation,

563
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,130
no one knows what he might do.

564
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,720
Please take care of Ke for me

565
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,170
and protect her.

566
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,990
You don't need to ask me to do that.

567
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,790
I'll certainly take care of her.

568
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:17,700
In times of danger,

569
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,200
just tell them
I'll lead troops to attack the capital

570
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,130
for the purpose of keeping Ke safe.

571
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,440
Lu Chi will bring troops
back to the capital.

572
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,520
Then what should we do now?

573
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:31,720
Speak louder.

574
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:33,700
Speak louder.

575
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,840
If you work for Marquis Wu'an,

576
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,010
you won't end up well.

577
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,080
Lu will soon

578
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,690
lead his troops to attack the city.

579
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,410
Then Marquis Wu'an will be beheaded.

580
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,600
You won't end up well, either.

581
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,700
Ke, don't be so stubborn.

582
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,080
Lu Chi can barely protect himself now.

583
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,010
Marquis Wu'an is destined to be the ruler.

584
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,620
I think you've lost your mind.

585
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,940
Shi Fa'ke is indeed feisty.

586
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,340
I really don't understand

587
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,800
why Lu Chi and He Kexian like her so much.

588
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,030
I don't want to hear it.

589
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:02,670
Get lost!

590
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,110
I don't want to see you again.

591
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,200
As long as you do as I say,

592
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,190
I can let you out.

593
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,280
Dream on.

594
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,030
Lu will soon come here

595
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,370
to save me.

596
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,440
Greetings, My Lord.

597
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,500
Mr. He.

598
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,450
Have you seen your beloved woman?

599
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,600
Yes, I have.

600
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,630
Thanks for your help, My Lord.

601
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,160
But Ke is still young.

602
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:46,070
It may take some time for her
to accept this matter.

603
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,590
But don't worry, My Lord.

604
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,720
I will certainly persuade her properly.

605
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,070
Oh, by the way, Ke has said that

606
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,070
Lu Chi will come to attack the city soon.

607
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,670
Please be prepared, My Lord.

608
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:55,660
Okay.

609
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,200
I'm aware of your kindness.

610
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,450
Don't worry.

611
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,400
Once Lu Chi dies,

612
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:06,740
you'll surely be able to marry that woman.

613
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,760
Thanks for your auspicious words.

614
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,590
-Open the door!
-Open the door!

616
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:22,310
The shop is closed today. Please leave.

617
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,620

620

Well...

621
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:32,790

How dare you!

627
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,190
How could you slander Lord Marquis?

628
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,850
Mr. He personally gave this title deed
to Lord Marquis

629
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:42,830
as a token of his loyalty.

630
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,470
Being able to work for Lord Marquis

631
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,750
is the He family's honor.

632
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,830
That's impossible.

633
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:49,110
How would my brother
side with Marquis Wu'an?

634
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,030
Whether you believe it or not,
it's not up to you.

635
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:50,660

Are you alright?

00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,220
Chongshan.

642
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,730
They said my brother had given this shop

643
00:29:58,730 --> 00:29:59,930
to Marquis Wu'an.

644
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,160
Don't confront them directly.

645
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,270
Let's leave first and figure things out.

646
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,010
Let's go.

647
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,660
This is not okay.
I need to get to the bottom of this.

649
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,520
Chongshan, why are you stopping me?

650
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,010
You need to trust Kexian.

651
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,360
Since he has done this,

652
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,940
he must have his own reasons.

653
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,650
Of course I trust my brother.

654
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,070
As I trust him,

655
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:26,970
I know

656
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:29,000
he would never side with Marquis Wu'an.

658
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,770
No, Ketian.

659
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,520
Give Kexian some time.

660
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,180
Trust me.

661
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:38,020

it won't be helpful.

there has been no movement
from that person lately.

690
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,370
I've heard he's often missing
from his bedchamber, too.

691
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,980

00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,380

701
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,880
the condition here is too bad for you.

702
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,400
How about I walk around to see

703
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,190

where we could stay?

00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,440
Then let me tell you.

736
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,720
No matter who I am and who you are,

737
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,060
to me,

738
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,900
you will always be Miss Qiyue.

739
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:19,010
It's all my fault for implicating you.

740
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:19,970
Otherwise,

741
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,110
you wouldn't need to
be in this awful place.

742
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,960
But I'm willing to be implicated by you.

743
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,000
What did you say?

744
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,760
I said...

745
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,900
Actually, I think this place

746
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,000
is quite nice.

747
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,150
It's quiet and relaxing.

748
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,250
Oh, by the way,

749
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,510
I forgot to ask you.

750
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,880
Why did those thugs

751
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,500
keep chasing you today?

752
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,760
To be honest with you,

753
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,710
I actually ran away from home.

754
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,960
You ran away?

755
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,800
I didn't want an arranged marriage,

756
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,330
so I ran away from home.

757
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,760
Then I met Ke,

758
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,780
and she took me in.

759
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,110
Do you think...

760
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,460
No, Miss Qiyue.

761
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,760
I think we have even more in common now.

762
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,430
I ran away from home, too.

763
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,730
Really? You also escaped marriage?

764
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,900
My situation is actually more complicated
than just escaping marriage.

765
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,800
However,

766
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,070
Ke once told me something.

767
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,710
Not marrying someone you love

768
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,280
will never bring happiness.

769
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,080
So,

770
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,920
I think you did the right thing.

771
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:35,080
I once saw a painting by Mr. Lin Yuan.

772
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,820
There are such words in it.

773
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,970
May I be like a star
and you be like the moon.

774
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,580
Then we can shine together every night.

775
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:47,670
Do you know what those words mean?

776
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,760
I think I do.

777
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,620
Meeting you deepens my feelings.

778
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,940
I only regret not meeting you sooner.

779
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:05,020
I'll go gather some more firewood.

780
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,960
I'll go with you.

781
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,340
Marriage Broker Shi.

782
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,070
How have you been lately?

783
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,920
I asked people to take good care of you.

784
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:33,850
May I ask what brings you here today?

785
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,630
I'm here today

786
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,630
to tell you something very important.

787
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:42,710
And it's good news.

788
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,920
Good news?

789
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,310
[Shi Fa'ke]

790
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,600
Look carefully.

791
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,020
This...

792
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,560
is the seal Lu carved for me.

793
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,630
So you can recognize it?

794
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,960
I'm here to tell you that

795
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,110
your dear Lu Chi

796
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,680
is dead.

797
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,690
Don't you think

798
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:20,470
this is wonderful news?

799
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:25,940
That's impossible.

800
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,150
Stop lying to me!

801
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,430
This seal

802
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,220
was found on Lu Chi's corpse.

803
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,310
There's no falsehood at all.

804
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,570
Among all those items
that could prove his identity,

805
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,030
Lu only left this seal.

806
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,900
Could it be that he isn't...

807
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,150
Lu must be safe now.

808
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,450
The seal is just a strategy
to deceive Marquis Wu'an.

809
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:53,140
I can't let Marquis Wu'an find out.

810
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:57,990
Marriage Broker Shi.

811
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,060
My condolences.

812
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:03,910
I've noticed that Mr. He loves you deeply.

813
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,010
You can think about him.

814
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,220
Get out.

815
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,810
Get out!

816
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,650
Belive it or not,

817
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,100
I could kill you now

818
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,230
so that you could
join Lu Chi in the netherworld.

819
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,230
You won't do that.

820
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,230
You're indeed quite clever.

821
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,810
You know I won't kill you,

822
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,360
as you're still useful to me.

823
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,920
So take good care of yourself.

824
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,180
Don't forget
you still have parents and brothers.

825
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,670
Qiyue, wait for me to come back.

826
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,550
[Zhaoyang Gate]

827
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:44,930
[Zhaoyang Gate]

828
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,160
[Zichen Hall]

829
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,450
[Zichen Hall]

830
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,300
[Zichen Hall]

831
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,710
Father, can you see this now?

832
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,920
I can finally

833
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,840
stand here rightfully.

834
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,500
I can finally

835
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,440
have all these things.

836
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,920
Father.

837
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,700
This country is mine ultimately.

838
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,730
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

839
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,330
Long live the Emperor!

840
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,580
Marquis Wu'an.

841
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,310
Why are you here?

842
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,440
Brother.

843
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:17,070
You truly want to rebel against me.

844
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,250
Why am I here?

845
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,230
This is my bedchamber.

846
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,560
If I'm not here,

847
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,170
where else should I be?

848
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,940
But look at you.

849
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,470
You brought troops into the palace
to seize power and rebel.

850
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:30,800
What punishment do you deserve?

851
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,460
What punishment do I deserve?

852
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:35,230
What punishment do I deserve?

853
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,830
Have I committed any crimes?

854
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,920
Brother.

855
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,510
The outcome of our battle
is already decided.

856
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:44,170
Not only this imperial palace

857
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,370
but also your throne belongs to me now.

858
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:48,490
Maybe I'll be the one to punish you!
