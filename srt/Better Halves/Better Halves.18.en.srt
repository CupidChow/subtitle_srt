4
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,390
Cheng Ruoning
truly doesn't know her place.

5
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,070
She's completely unworthy of you.

6
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,020
How about I kill her for you?

7
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,020
What a fool!

8
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,210
What an idiot!

9
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,440
Cheng Ruoning is certainly contemptible,

10
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,040
but Shi Fa'ke is the most detestable one.

11
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,790
Yes.

in front of everyone.

15
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,530
She even threatened me
and told me not to seek revenge.

16
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,320
That was absolutely outrageous!

17
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,380
It was outrageous.

Let me ask you.

19
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,970
If something were to happen
to Cheng Ruoning now,

20
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,680
people would know I was the mastermind,
wouldn't they?

21
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,640

such a stupid idea?

22

Get out!

28
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,320
Fang Yue,
I've asked you to come to the capital

29
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,270
because I want you to suppress Shi Fa'ke

30
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,770
and help me with my plans.

31
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,560
But there has been no progress
after so long.

32
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,300
I'm so disappointed in you.

33
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,170
Shi Fa'ke
is indeed a capable marriage broker.

34
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,030
What did you say?

35
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,700
Her mind is pure,

36
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,730
and she solely focuses on
being a good matchmaker.

37
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,660
The simpler the person is, the more likely
she is to achieve great things.

38
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,990
In terms of this,
I can't compare with her.

39
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,730
I'm full of selfish motives
and improper desires.

Alright. Stop talking about this.

41
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,490
With Cheng Ruoning's status like that,

42
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,150
it doesn't matter if she refuses to
join Marquis Wu'an's Mansion.

43

My Lord.

46
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,490
The fate of marriage is predestined.

47
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,470
It won't end well if you force it.

00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,790
Did you two quarrel with each other?

Let me take a guess.

61

You both look so troubled.

62
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,290
It must have something to do
with Marquis Wu'an.

63
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,640
Marquis Wu'an?

64
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,790
What did he do to you?

65
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,200
I suspect it's not about
what Marquis Wu'an has done again,

66
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,330
but about what Young Master Qiujiang

67
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,320
and Miss Cheng are worried
that he might do,

68
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,710
which has caused the disagreement.

69
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,210
Mr. Lu is right.

70
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,860
I rejected Marquis Wu'an's proposal

71
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,640
and embarrassed him
during the matchmaking event.

72
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,770
I'm afraid he won't let this go easily.

73
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,410
As long as we still stay in the capital,

74
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,780
he can make things difficult
for Qiujiang and me anytime.

75
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,100
I'm worried that next time,

76
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,240
he'll hurt Qiujiang even worse.

77
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,880

78
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,350

are here.

if you leave the capital?

84
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,070
It means we'll have to leave our hometown
and start all over again.

It doesn't matter for myself,

all their assets to the country.

00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,940
Marquis Wu'an won't let her off.

365
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,570
Lu Yi.

366
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,410
You must stay by Ke's side
and protect her properly.

367
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,810
No mistakes are allowed.

368
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:52,400
Yes.

369
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,130
Come back.

370
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,210
This is not okay. I'm still worried.

371
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,720
I'll pick up Ke myself.

372
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,220
Ke, let's go.

373
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,720
Now I need to go back
to look after my shop.

374
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,900

375
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,610
I still have something to do.
You go first.

376
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,070
What else do you need to do?

377
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,140
This one.

378
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,410
I got it.

379
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,690
You've spotted a handsome young man,

380
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,120
so you can't help
doing the matchmaking work again.

381
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,400
Then I'll go first.

382
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,740
Good luck.

383
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:42,660
Just go.

384
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,250
If you can't decide which play to watch,

385
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,990
I can recommend a couple of plays to you.

386
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,400
Then please recommend some to me, Miss.

387
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,580
I think you might

00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,300
Thank you, Miss.

391
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,610
Sir, you don't look familiar.

392
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,000
Are you from another city?

393
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,950
How old are you? Are you married?

If you have the plan to get married,

396
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,380
you can ask for my help.

397
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,680
This young man looks unfamiliar.

398
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,000
Are you from another city?

399
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,800
How old are you? Are you married?

400
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,280
She's doing the same thing again.

401
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,550
So you're from
the Official Matchmaking Agency?

402
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,580
Yes, that's true.

I'm sorry for not recognizing you.

00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,310
However,
I won't trouble you today, Miss Shi.

411
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,320
After all, this is our first time
meeting each other,

412
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,520
so it might be too soon

413
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,950
to discuss marriage now.

414
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,090
When I decide to get married
in the future,

415
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,250
I can ask for your help
at the Official Matchmaking Agency.

416
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,830
Sir, if you're planning
to visit the Official Matchmaking Agency,

417
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,360
doesn't it mean
that you intend to get married?

418
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,770
I can see that your forehead is glowing,
and your eyes are sparkling with romance.

419
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,810
I guess you have a social gathering today.

420
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,640
I can see that your forehead is glowing,
and your eyes are sparkling with romance.

421
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,680
I guess you have a social gathering today.

422
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,330
Meeting like this is fate.

423
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,510
How about I take you
to taste the capital's delicacies

424
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,820
so that we can have a nice chat?

425
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,300
Thank you for your kindness, Miss Shi.

426
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,330
However...

427
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,880
However, that won't be necessary.

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,310
I...

429
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,730
Don't stand on ceremony.

430
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,170
Having a meal with me
will only benefit you.

431
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,800
Maybe I can help you find someone.

432
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,410
How do you know I'm looking for someone?

433
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,670
As matchmakers,

reading people's minds is our basic skill.

435
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,200
When we first met,

436
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,130
you seemed quite delighted to know
I'm from the Official Matchmaking Agency.

437
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,550
You were not in a hurry
to visit the Official Matchmaking Agency,

438
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,310
but you said you would visit there
in the future.

439
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,790
You were not in a hurry to talk to me,

440
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,530
but you treated me politely.

441
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,010
I guess you're not in a hurry
to marry the person you've chosen,

442
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:51,030
but instead, you're looking for the person
you're going to marry.

443
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:54,620
Miss Shi, are you a fortune teller?

444
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,020
Of course not.

00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,580

Since you've just arrived in the capital,

470
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,120
you have to visit Xibao Pavilion.

471
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,980
There are all kinds of treasures
at Xibao Pavilion.

472
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,370
And with its delicacies,
it's even hard to book a table there.

473
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,440
Oh, by the way, Lu here

474
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:58,200
is the Chief of Xibao Pavilion.

475
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,370
That's impressive.

476
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,630
Please take me to visit there, Miss Shi.

477
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,770
But today, let me treat you two

478
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,650
to a meal.

479
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,940
It's such bad timing.

480
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,050
Today, it happens to
be our mid-month inventory check,

481
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,640
so Xibao Pavilion is closed.

482
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,170
I should go back early, too.

483
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:12,900
Let's go, Ke.

484
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,640
It's getting late. Let's go back.

485
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,100
It's such bad timing, huh?

486
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:19,070
It's fine.
We can go to Xibao Pavilion another day.

487
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,580
Today, I'll take you
to try some local specialties.

488

Miss Shi, do you often come here?

This place

497
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,140
is Lu's and my favorite noodle stall.

498
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,490
Their beef rice noodles
can just melt in your mouth.

499
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,730
You can't find such noodles anywhere else.

500
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,750
In that case, I have to try

501
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,790
these beef rice noodles
which you're strongly recommending

502
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,180
and see what they really taste like.

503
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,310
Sir, three bowls of beef rice noodles.

504
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,320
Okay.

Here, my dear customers.
Your rice noodles are ready.

506
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:08,320
I'm sorry.

Since Mr. Yan's rice noodles were spilled,

512
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,440
please have mine instead.

513
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,240
Mr. Yan, please have mine.

514
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,700
Mine has more beef in it.

No, I'm not.

00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,420
But there is someone I have a crush on.

519
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,590
Why don't you tell me more about it?

520
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,210
If you two are in love,

521

I'll definitely help you two get married.

522
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,780
Actually, I came to the capital this time

523
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:19,940
to find this person.

524
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,530
I've had a crush on this person for years.

525
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,660
This person
has always been my spiritual comfort,

526
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,720
though I don't know the person's name

527
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,930
or whereabouts.

528
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:32,710
Nor do I even know
how to find this person.

529
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,500
He has loved that person for years.

530
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:38,510
He doesn't know the person's name
or whereabouts.

531
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,630
But this person has always been
his spiritual comfort.

532
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,400
How come the person
who this man is looking for

533
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,370
has such a similar situation to me?

534
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,500
When it comes to such matters,

535
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,360
I'm the most experienced,

536
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,850
I can definitely help you
find this person.

537
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,570
Really?

538
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,930
But before that,

539
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:57,000
I need to get to know you better, Mr. Yan.

540
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,430
Only in this way can I customize the plan.

541
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,610
May I know what you usually

542
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,210
like to do in your spare time?

543
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,170
I only have one small hobby.

544
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,200
I love Mr. Lin Yuan's paintings.

545
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,480
You also like Mr. Lin Yuan?

546
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,680
Then we truly have the same interest.

547
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,870
Miss Shi, you also like Mr. Lin Yuan?

548
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,010
Do you like his painting,
Spring Prosperity in the Jade Hall?

549
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:17,210
That painting is absolutely extraordinary.

550
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,610
It has such a vivid style.

551
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,560
Our family doesn't have
Spring Prosperity in the Jade Hall.

552
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,960
But on my birthday,

553
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,870
my good friend

554
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,560
gave me a painting
of Having Equal Status in Marriage.

555
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,870
Are you interested in seeing it?

556
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,740
My home is just nearby.

557
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,720
Sure. Then let's...

558
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,270

559

It's getting late.

560
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,310
I've taken up a lot of your time today.

561
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:44,140
Miss Shi, Chief Lu,
thanks for your generous hospitality.

562
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,270
I'll come visit your home another day.

563
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:51,050
Mr. Yan, where are you staying?

564
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,170
Qingfeng Inn.

565
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,920
Since you've just arrived in the capital,

566
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,960
you must be unfamiliar with the roads.

567
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,430
Why don't we escort you back together?

568
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,120
Lu, you...

569
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:58,940
I'm free, too.

570
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:00,590
Let's go together.

571
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,900
Sir.

572
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,580
Take care, my dear customers.

573
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,130
Mr. Lin Yuan's paintings

574
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,840
have such delicate
and touching brushstrokes,

575
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,840
as if carrying countless emotions,

576
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,730
with thousands of words
waiting to be conveyed.

577
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,490
It feels like
with just one stroke of his brush,

578
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:24,350
all things in this world
fall under his command.

579
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,010
Miss Shi, you're quite right.

580
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,960
I've always felt that

581
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,960
Mr. Lin Yuan's paintings
are different from others'.

582
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:35,670
Others always say that the inner spirit
can't be captured in a painting.

583
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,240
But I think in Mr. Lin Yuan's paintings,

584
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,000
the inner spirit
is so vividly captured.

585
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:42,700
His works are truly masterpieces.

586
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:46,620
This is what they call
"each stroke captures the inner spirit."

587
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,560
Mr. Lin Yuan's skill could be called
divine brushwork,

588
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,020
which is not exaggerated.

589
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,040
How wonderful.

590
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,750
They clearly have the same interest.

591
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,970
Mr. Lin Yuan's every stroke
captures the inner spirit.

592
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,690
Miss Shi, Mr. Lu, thank you

593
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,260
for having a tour with me
in the capital today.

Lu.

595
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,910
I need to discuss something with Mr. Yan.

596
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,400
Could you wait here for me?

597
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,370
Should I call you Mr. Yan or Miss Yan?

598
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,110
Marriage Broker Shi, I...

599
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,330
I guess

600
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,810
you don't want others
to know your identity,

601
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,470
so I'll still call you Mr. Yan.

602
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,970
With your attire like that,

603
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,200
you must have your reasons, huh?

604
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,000
Indeed.

605
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,220
My father has arranged a marriage for me

606
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,350
which I don't like,

607
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,900
so I...

608

In our life, there are some moments

609
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,980
when we can't control our fate.

about Mr. Yan.

00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:05,350
It's actually quite magical.

909
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:06,620
I got one

910
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,220
of Mr. Lin Yuan's paintings by accident.

911
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:12,030
I was attracted to
that painting at first sight.

912
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,710
In that painting,

913
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,240
I seemed to see someone
who was a bit lonely

914
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,390
but also very interesting.

915
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,110
I've experienced

916
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,880
that kind of loneliness, too.

917
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:31,370
So I think he and I can
understand each other.

918
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:32,880
Qiyue.

919
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,210
I understand all this spiritual connection
you're talking about.

920
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,670
But what if

921
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:41,520
Mr. Lin Yuan is already married
and has children?

922
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,850
What should you do then?

923
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:47,080
Then I'll accept my fate and let go of it.

924
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:49,510
But Ke,

925
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,260
I can see

926
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,360
a hint of childlike innocence
in his paintings.

927
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,490
He must be around my age.

928
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,050
Qiyue, these are all just your guesses.

929
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,820
Nobody knows what the reality is.

930
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,660
Ke.

931
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,750
I've carefully studied
Mr. Lin Yuan's paintings,

932
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,080
and I've noticed
he has never painted a wife

933
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,010
or children.

934
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,180
The figures in his painting
of "Having Equal Status in Marriage"

935
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,580
aren't from our dynasty.

936
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,530
They must be from his imagination.

937
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,800
Mr. Lin Yuan

938
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,830
clearly has never been married,

939
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,410
let alone having children.

940
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:22,850
So, when he painted these scenes,

941
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,130
he couldn't do it quite proficiently.

942
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,480
However,

943
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:30,180
not only do we not know
where to find Mr. Lin Yuan,

944
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,770
but I also think that your idea

945
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,080
is a bit impulsive.

946
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:34,860
Ke.

947
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,790
Are you unwilling to help me now?

948
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,460
It's not that I don't want to help you.

949
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,060
But we need to find Mr. Lin Yuan first

950
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,710
before discussing what comes next.

951
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,220
This matter is a bit complicated.

952
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,620
You have to stay patient.

953
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:50,030
But I am impatient.

954
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,330
I want to know
if he's the same as what I've imagined.

955
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:54,040
I'll regret it if I never meet him.

956
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:54,570
Alright.

957
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,650
I'll definitely figure out a way

958
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,190
to find this like-minded friend for you.

959
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,110
No matter what,

960
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,020
let's find Mr. Lin Yuan first.

961
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,410
After we find him,

962
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,300
we'll talk about what comes next.

963
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,140
Okay.

964
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:13,910
My Lord.

965
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:18,190
How's the progress on suppressing the news

966
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,730
about the princess of the vassal state?

967
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:20,540
My Lord,

968
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,720
all the information has been erased.

969
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,690
No one can find any clues.

970
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:27,270
As for the appearance
of the vassal state's princess,

971
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:29,870
I've asked some men
to spread misinformation.

972
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:32,700
Now only you possess
the princess's portrait.

973
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,010
No one else
can find information about her.

974
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,140
What about you guys?

975
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:38,280
Are you also unable
to find the information?

976
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,010
We haven't found anything yet.

977
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:42,910
Then just go on investigating it.

978
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:43,640
Yes.

979
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:54,800
Fang Yue.

980
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:59,260
Before leaving,
the princess of the vassal state said

981
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,430
she would never marry His Majesty.

982
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:06,010
She claimed that she came here
to look for someone called Mr. Lin Yuan.

983
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:09,740
Since she's running away from marriage
and has someone she wants to marry,

984
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,890
I believe she will go to
the Official Matchmaking Agency.

985
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,220
Keep an eye out for that.

986
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,310
Yes.

987
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,090
Fang Yue.

988
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:24,430
No matter what,

989
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:28,380
you must help me
marry the princess of the vassal state

990
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:31,660
and assist me
in achieving my grand ambition.

991
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,700
Yes.

992
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:49,350
[Gaoyou Posthouse]

993
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,330
Now that I'm dressed as a man,

994
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:06,090
what is there to be afraid of?

995
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,480
Come on. Let's drink.

996
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,130
Alright.

997
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:14,210
Excuse me.

998
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,340
Hello.

999
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:20,680
Is there anything I can help you with?

1000
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:24,320
Has anything happened
in Gaoyou State recently?

1001
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:28,740
The country has been peaceful lately
with no interesting news.

1002
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,220
That's good then.

1003
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,120
This is strange.

1004
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,960
Why hasn't Father sent anyone
to look for me?

1005
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:43,210
Has he given up the idea of
marrying me off for two countries' peace?

1006
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:44,270
Did my departure

1007
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,820
finally make him come to his senses?

1008
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:49,170
Then I must be much safer now, huh?

1009
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:51,590
I won't need to disguise myself anymore.

1010
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:00,850
Lu.

1011
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:02,860
Ke, you're here.

1012
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,000
Lu,

1013
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:08,130
will you help me with anything?

1014
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:10,780
If you need anything,

1015
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,960
I'll certainly do whatever I can.

1016
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:15,590
Then can you help me find Mr. Lin Yuan?

1017
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,020
You... You want to find Mr. Lin Yuan?

1018
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,160
What's wrong?
So you don't want to help me now?

1019
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,110
Why do you want to find Mr. Lin Yuan?

1020
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:29,420
That's a secret.

1021
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,670
Okay. I promise you.

1022
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:35,940
But you have to...

1023
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,010
Lu, I knew you were the best!
