00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,530
Ke, come in and let's talk.

186
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,920
I was right about you.

187
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,740
Marriage Broker Shi and Mr. Lu
are actually old acquaintances.

188
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,280
Then the proposal of marriage
can be put on the agenda.

189
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,300
Let's do it today.

190
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,730
I think we can do it today.

191
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,410
Mr. Lu, I'm Shen Tongyun.

192
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:37,680
You must have received my visiting card.

193
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,250
Visiting card?

194
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,940
Ke, is this your friend?

195
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,120
Sort of.

196
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,240
Let me introduce you to each other.

197
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,320
This is Miss Shen Tongyun,

198
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,610
the daughter of the Vice Minister
of the Ministry of Works.

199
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,360
He's Lu Chi, the Chief of Xibao Pavilion.

200
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,550
My taste is really unique.

201
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,640
I didn't expect Mr. Lu
to be the Chief of Xibao Pavilion.

202
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,930
Don't forget what you promised me.

203
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,670
Ke, what did you promise her?

204
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,870
I...

205
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,120
There are too many people here.

206
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,150
And it's not good to talk about
such things on the street.

207
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:17,730
[Xibao Pavilion]

208
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,760
Why don't you go back
to wait for my good news?

209
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,150
I finally saw him in person
after sending the visiting card.

210
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,750
I don't want to leave so soon.

211
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,460
Chief.

212
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,000
Since you're Ke's friend,

213
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,870
please come in.

214
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,510
I still have something to do.

215
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,320
Ms. Li, please receive the guests.

216
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:38,990
Yes.

217
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:41,910
Since Mr. Lu has invited me to go inside,

218
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,130
I'll accept it.

219
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,050
Ladies, come with me.

220
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,040
Let's go. Accompany me to take a look
around the Xibao Pavilion.

221
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,640
Whatever you like, I'll pay.

222
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,680
-Let's go.
-I...

223
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,740
I know about this.

224
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,290
Revealing the Dagger at the Last Minute.

225
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,700
Why has that person
been so fond of classics lately?

226
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,670
It's fine that there's trouble.

227
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,650
But the trouble has come to me.

228
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,550
Master, I don't quite understand.

229
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,590
Jing Ke assassinating King Qin
is very troublesome?

230
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,280
Does this turret look familiar to you?

231
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,910
This was built
during the late emperor's reign.

232
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,510
Rumor has it that there's a secret passage
to the Forbidden Palace.

233
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,990
I've never heard of such rumors.

234
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,640
What's the trouble then?

235
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,200
The construction of this turret

236
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,730
was led by Lord Shen, the Vice Minister
of the Ministry of Works.

237
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,240
Master.

238
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,480
Come in.

239
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,550
Has the daughter of the Shen family left?

240
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,150
She's wandering downstairs.

241
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,150
It doesn't look like she's leaving.

242
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,420
Got it. I'll go take a look.

243
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,840
By the way,

244
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,120
if the daughter of the Shen family
leaves the Xibao Pavilion,

245
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,360
remember to keep an eye on her for me.

246
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,160
Yes.

247
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,120
Which one is Master
going to take a look at?

248
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,870
Is it Miss Shi

249
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,950
or the daughter of the Shen family?

250
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,040
Stop asking me.

251
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,260
I'm confused, too.

252
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,510
Miss,

253
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,390
how about I help you
try on this one again?

254
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,360
This one looks nice, too.

255
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,160
Forget it. I don't like this one.

256
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:17,970
Yes.

257
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
This way, please.

258
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,370
He said there was something urgent.

259
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,500
And now he's in a hurry to see this girl.

260
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,690
Lu, do you need me to introduce her again?

261
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,730
Miss Shen Tongyun
is from a prominent family.

262
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,080
She also looks beautiful

263
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,980
and has a gentle temperament.

264
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,750
She's even extremely loyal
in her relationship.

265
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,720
Ke, what do you mean?

266
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,160
I...

267
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,180
Marriage Broker Shi,
don't beat around the bush.

268
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,040
Let me be frank.

269
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,250
Mr. Lu,

270
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,340
I've always liked
your handsome appearance.

271
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,240
In the capital,

272
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,260
only He Kexian can compare with you.

273
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,030
Of course, you are more handsome than him.

274
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,100
So I've asked Marriage Broker Shi
to be my matchmaker.

275
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,530
What do you think?

276
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,390
It turns out that you've taken
this matchmaking case.

277
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,310
Lu, I haven't.

278
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,120
I know I should...

279
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,780
You know?

280
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,900
Mr. Lu, don't misunderstand.

281
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,140
I've just found out about your identity.

282
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,180
This time, I'm here

283
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,370
just to admire you.

284
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,820
Ms. Li.

285
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,680
Chief, what can I do for you?

286
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,900
See the guests out.

287
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,420
The Xibao Pavilion is too small.

288
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,220
I'm sorry, but we can't receive
Miss Shen anymore.

289
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,150
Then... Then I'll also...

290
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,080
Marriage Broker Shi, please stay.

291
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,870
Since you're a marriage broker,

292
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,820
please listen to more of my advice.

293
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,560
Stop right there, you two!

294
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,220
Let me see you out.

Don't touch me!

297
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,270
Take care, Miss Shen.

298
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,350
What are you looking at, ugly girl?

299
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,020
I'm Marriage Broker Deng,

of the Official Matchmaking Agency.

301
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,320
Miss Shen,

302
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,690
can I talk to you?

303
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,420
Ke.

304
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,040
Have you really agreed
to be Shen Tongyun's matchmaker?

305
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,530
Do you still remember
that you were drunk yesterday?

306
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,810
While we're talking about matchmaking,

307
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,410
why are you suddenly mentioning
that I was drunk yesterday?

308
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,710
Of course I remember.

309
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,270

You're known as the God of Wealth
in the capital.

00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,550
Even your hair glitters with golden light.

313
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,590
What else?

314
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,690
What else could there be?

315
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,990
Why can't I remember anything?

316
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,840
Forget it.

317
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,010
But Ke,

318
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,630
there are many matchmaking cases.

319
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,830
Why did you choose Shen Tongyun's case?

320
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,220
Marriage Broker Deng said

321
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,600
she wouldn't assign
matchmaking cases to me anymore.

322
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,430
My mother can't go back
to the Official Matchmaking Agency now.

323
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,090
I'm the only hope
for being No.1 matchmaker in the world.

324
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,440
I also want to make a choice.

325
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,810
But I have no choice.

326
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:03,260
Apart from Qi Shaoheng, Shen Tongyun

327
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,930
is another tricky problem
in the the capital.

328
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,990
If I succeed in her matchmaking case,

329
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:10,990
Marriage Broker Deng will no longer have
any reason to kick me out.

330
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,490
Of course, I know

331
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,569
I should've asked for your opinion first.

332
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,349
But I've also thought about it carefully.

333
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,310
To me, she is

334
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,050
my only client now.

335
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:23,270
I can't offend her.

336
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,720
I have no choice.

337
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,970
No matter what,

338
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,030
I want to be a good marriage broker.

339
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,050
Since I've taken this matchmaking case,

340
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,780
I should work hard till the end.

341
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,790
Besides,

342
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,920
since Miss Shen likes you,
it's understandable

343
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,520
that she wants to pursue you.

344
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,390
I think she is quite
straightforward and sincere.

345
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,610
She's not trying to beat around the bush,
and that's good.

346
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,490
It's not wrong to find

347
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,810
a husband she likes.

348
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,830
I'm not saying that she's not good.

349
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,560
It's just that I don't like her.

350
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,920
You were in a hurry to see her just now.

351
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,700
But now you're saying you don't like her.

352
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,740
Do you like her or not?

353
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,650
If you don't understand me,
it's useless to say more.

354
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,400
What's going on?

355
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:22,170
Why does my chest feel so uncomfortable?

356
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,340
Forget it. I shouldn't be sad.

357
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,900
It looks like

358
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,400
Lu doesn't want it.

359
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,880
I need to find a substitute
as soon as possible

360
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,290
to show my talent and sincerity.

361
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,250
I can't let this matchmaking case
get ruined.

00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,350
Their pastries are very delicious.

365
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,190
Ketian.

366
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,880
Xian, look.

367
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,650
It's a bunny.

368
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,830
It's so cute.

369
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,380
I love bunnies.

370
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,920
Kexian, your cooking skills
are getting better and better.

371
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,410
Put it down.

372
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,310
This is for Ke.

373
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,000
Ke hasn't been here for a long time.

374
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,910
I finally developed a new set of desserts.

375
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,370
I'm going to send it to her.

376
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,490
You always talk about Ke.

377
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
All you know is Ke.

378
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,720
Xian.

379
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,870
Ke.

380
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,960
You're just in time.

381
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,660
Look.

382
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,640
These are the new desserts
I specially developed for you.

383
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,370
-Taste them.
-They're so cute.

384
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,460
It's delicious.

385
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,950
If you can make it iced,

386
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,480
it'll be a hot-selling product in summer.

387
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,440
Okay. I'll make it iced next time

388
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,440
and send it to you.

389
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:44,710
Ketian.

390
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:45,860
Ketian.

391
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,240
Xian, I know you treat me the best.

392
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,250
Can you do me a favor?

393
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,490
Don't... Don't cry.

394
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,810
Don't cry.

395
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,590
If you need anything,

396
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,720
I'll help you, okay?

397
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,240
Currently, my mother can't go back
to the Official Matchmaking Agency.

398
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,120
Now I'm the only one who's hanging in.

399
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:10,030
And Marriage Broker Deng
always gives me a hard time.

400
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,140
If I can't solve the matchmaking case,

401
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,660
how can I explain to my mother?

402
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,920
How can I gain a foothold
in the Official Matchmaking Agency?

403
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,050
Okay. I'll help you.

404
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:17,970
Xian.

405
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,060
You're like a real brother to me.

406
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,840
Let's go.

407
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,470
Where are you taking my brother to?

408
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,590
I'm going to take him
to have a blind date with Shen Tongyun.

409
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:26,960
A blind...

410
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,920
Shi Fa'ke! You have no conscience!

411
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,650
My brother won't go on blind dates.

412
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,240
Kexian, don't let her tears fool you.

413
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,430
She was just pretending to cry.

414
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,550
Ketian.

415
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,360
Please show some mercy.

416
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,330
My acting was probably too much.

417
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,270
But what I said was sincere.

418
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,300
Look at Xian.

419
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,210
He should think about
marriage at this age.

420
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,850
Shen Tongyun is from a good family
and is a good person.

421
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,480
But she just loves handsome men.

422
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,410
She's kind of a good match for Xian.

423
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,310
Kexian, tell her.

424
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,270
You clearly like her. Why don't you...

425
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:57,880
Ketian.

426
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,700
Stop it.

427
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,110
Shi Fa'ke, if you don't leave today,

428
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,900
I'll cut ties with you.

429
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,510
Ketian.

430
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,660
Xian!

431
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,760
-Ketian.
-Xian!

432
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,640
Stop messing around.

433
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,290
Ketian!

434
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,990
Kexian, you can't go.

435
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,830
Do you know why she treated you like that?

436
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,750
Because you kept

437
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,680
your feelings in your heart
and refused to tell her.

438
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,920
If you dare to go today,

439
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,560
I'll tell her for you.

440
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,330
Ketian, can you stop messing around?

441
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,210
Ke is just childish.

442
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,260
If you say that to her,

443
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,340
you'll scare her.

444
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,240
Fine. I'll stay out of it. Okay?

445
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,110
Well... Ketian.

446
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,470
Master!

447
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,770
Master!

448
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,180
Master!

449
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,240
Master, something bad happened!

450
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,090
Make it short.

451
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,590
Since Qi Shaoheng's incident,

452
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,110
Marquis Wu'an has been
keeping an eye on you.

453
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,670
I've met several spies.

454
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,200
I didn't dare to alert them,

455
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,660
so I didn't deal with them.

456
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,950
No need to deal with them.

457
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,680
I have a way to make Marquis Wu'an
relax his vigilance.

458
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,240
Master, I haven't finished speaking yet.

459
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:55,820
The daughter of the Shen family
met with Marriage Broker Deng.

460
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,210
I only liked Lu Chi's appearance.

461
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,750
I didn't expect him to be the chief
of the Xibao Pavilion.

462
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,680
I've really selected a perfect candidate.

463
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,940
But this person is a very proud man
and has high standards.

464
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,370
I'm afraid it'll be hard to persuade him.

465
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,200
Lu Chi is nothing.

466
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,950
He's just a bit rich

467
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,890
and looks handsome.

468
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,240
But don't forget

469
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,920
that he has no power in the capital

470
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,400
and has no foundation.

471
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,170
Actually, it doesn't matter
whether he's rich or not.

472
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,660
Marriage Broker Deng, as you know,

473
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,160
I only care about facial appearance.

474
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,290
Facial appearance?

475
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,670
The husband I've chosen for you

476
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,540
is very handsome, too.

477
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,560
He's not inferior to Lu Chi at all.

478
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,880
Fine. I'll take a look.

479
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,510
Alright.

480
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:42,190
I hope this gentleman
can also be handsome.

481
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,160
Marriage Broker Deng
seems to have persuaded Miss Shen.

482
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,450
I'm afraid you'll like

483
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,360
the following news.

484
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,210
What a coincidence.

485
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,840
When I followed them
out of the restaurant,

486
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,350
I happened to run into Miss Shi,

487
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,500
who was kicked out of He's Bakery.

488
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,340
Why was Ketian suddenly so fierce?

489
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,720
I didn't ask her to go on a blind date.

490
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,240
Thank you, Marriage Broker Deng.

491
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,980
Alright. See you then.

492
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:15,560
Okay.

493
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,740
Then what happened?

494
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,310
Then...

495
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,180
You mean

496
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,680
Ke followed Shen Tongyun?

497
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,210
Exactly.

498
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,030
Go investigate the people
around Shen Tongyun,

499
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,290
especially the ones who are close to her.

500
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,840
As for Marriage Broker Shi,

501
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,630
you don't need to care about her.

502
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,410
Master.

503
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,240
Actually, you don't have to
be so worried about me.

504
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,510
I'm very healthy.

505
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,060
I can...

506
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,550
Buns!

507
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,830
Hot buns!

508
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,300
Sir, please give me some buns.

509
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,280
[Shen's Mansion]

510
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,000
They're both duplicitous liars.

511
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,370
One of them promised
to entrust her marriage to me,

512
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,370
but she secretly contacted Aunt Deng.

513
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,730
Lu is even worse.

514
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,380
He's playing hard to get.

515
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,030
He rejected her on the surface,

516
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,830
but he secretly went to the gate
of her house

517
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,940
and stared at her from behind.

518
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,720
Marriage Broker Shi, why are you here?

519
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,500
You're a duplicitous man,
and you broke your promise.

520
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,430
Let go of me!

521
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,520
Let go of me!

522
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,010
Ke, are you okay?

523
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,400
It hurts!

524
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,370
Don't touch me.

525
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,480
Luckily, it's just a sprain.

526
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,620
Since you have many male friends,

527
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,620
which one should I ask to pick you up?

528
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,170
Don't change the subject.

529
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,880
I know

530
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,160
you like Miss Shen.

531
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,680
Don't worry.

532
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,750
I'll try my best
to bring you two together.

533
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,010
Bringing us together?

534
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,360
So you'll be happy
if you can bring us together?

535
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,220
Then you won't be angry
after you bring us together?

536
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:40,150
That's... That's not what I mean.

537
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,620
Don't talk nonsense.

538
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,480
I'm an official matchmaker.

539
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,160
Why would I be unhappy for handling
my client's matchmaking case?

540
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,760
I would surely be very happy.

541
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,470
Yes, I'm very happy.

542
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,640
Alright. It's fine
as long as you're happy.

543
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,010
When I take you back home,

544
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,610
you can continue to be happy.

545
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,390
I don't need you to take me back home.

546
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,130
I can endure the pain and go home myself.

547
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,600
I can't bear it.

548
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,700
Stop!

549
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,210
My dear brothers, why are you two here?

550
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,030
If we still hadn't come yet,

551
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,630
you would be abducted by him.

552
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,770
He's a stranger.

553
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,800
How could you be so close to him?

554
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,090
Let's go. We'll take you home.

555
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,640
-Xianxian, I need dignity, too.
-I'll keep a close eye on you.

556
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,350
Xianxian, don't I also need dignity?

557
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,830
How embarrassing!

558
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,040
Put me down at once!

559
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,940
I'm so angry!

560
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,440
This person has gone too far, hasn't he?

561
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,070
How dare he covet your sister?

562
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,350
Confine your sister for a few more days
while her leg is injured.

563
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:17,270
Father, it seems that Ke needs to
be the matchmaker for Mr. Lu

564
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,750
and the daughter of the Shen family.

565
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:19,500
Father.

566
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,450
Although Lu has you-know-what towards Ke,

567
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,070
he hasn't you-know-what yet.

568
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,100
What if we you-know-what

569
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,790
and Ke gets angry?

570
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,110
Then should we really you-know-what?

571
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,650
We absolutely gotta you-know-what!

572
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,510
Let me tell you.

573
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,590
I'd rather kill a thousand people wrongly

574
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,110
than let one guilty person escape.

575
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,750
Besides, Lu's background
remains unknown.

576
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,380
While the three of us were away from home,

577
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,320
he broke into our house,

578
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,110
bullied your sister

579
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,070
and made her angry.

580
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,160
She even sprained her ankle.

581
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,790
That's too much.

582
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,090
That's too much.

583
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:43,790
"Too much" you say?

584
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,710
That is way beyond "too much".

585
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,110
I can't stand it anymore.

586
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,660
Cousin, does it still hurt?

587
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:51,940
I'm fine.

588

Here's the thing.

589
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,200
We couldn't figure out Lu's thoughts.

590
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,240
How about I go to see Xian
and give it a try again

591
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,640
when Ketian is not angry?

592
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,030
Anyway, Shen Tongyun is determined
to marry a handsome man.

593
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:03,450
Right?

594
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:04,970
I think so, too.

My dear daughter.

598
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,400
You should have a good rest

599
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,820
at home these days.

600
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,250
Wait for me and your two brothers

601
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,380
to find an interesting place.

602
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,180
Then we can go have fun together.

603
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,350
-We can ask Xian to join us.
-Okay.

604
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,700
Brothers, you misunderstood Mr. Lu today.

605
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,540
Why don't we ask him to join us

606
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,890
so that you can apologize?

607
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,910
We'd better go somewhere with snacks.

608
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,760
Let's eat from one end
of the street to the other.

609

That's what makes it fun.

00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,270
We'll go deal with it now.

611
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,050
Is it okay?

612
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,140
Of course.

613
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,670
But Ke, you need to recuperate.

614
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:39,180
Yes.

615
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,720
Chongshan and I caused trouble.

616
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,450
Of course we will go invite him.

617
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,810
Okay.

618
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,320
Daughter, we haven't played chess
for a long time.

619
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,190
Why don't we play chess?

What's that sound?

625
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,070
Why is there the sound of breaking tiles?

626
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,540
Maybe the house is old.

627
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,750
It's time to replace the old tiles
with new ones.

628

Leave the household matters to me.

629

is to look after your sister well.

Okay.

Come on.

632
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,910
Is it really necessary
to repair the house?

633
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,940
Miss Shi's injury is not serious.

634
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,350
She'll recover after a few days' rest.

635
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,190
But I heard

636
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,190

to attract so much publicity

you're talking so much
at the mention of Ketian.

Ketian must be angry with me.

Not only does she forbid me to see her,

00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,080
Here you are.

730
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,940
Come on.

731
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,350
Chongshan.

732
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,210
Thanks.

733
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,280
I want two more bowls of noodles.

734
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,680
Ke.

735
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,610
It's delicious.

736
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:15,570
It's delicious.

737
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,840
Sir, do you still have the ingredients?

738
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,280
There's only one bowl
of rice noodles left.

739
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,700
Let me do it.

740
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,400
Go ahead with your work.

741
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,090
Here. This is for you.

742
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,080
Eat it while it's hot.

743
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,400
Xianxian, aren't you hungry?

744
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,560
Xianxian, enjoy it.

745
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,260
You're too kind.

746
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,750
Don't stand on ceremony.

747
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,860
I'm full.

748
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,370
You may have it.

749
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,460
I...

750
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,360
You may have it.

751
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,449
I'm full.

752
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,920
The flavor of these rice noodles

753
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,120
is indeed one of the best in the capital.

754
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,030
Why do you guys keep pushing it?

755
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,090
I'll eat it if you don't. Give it to me.

756
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,449
Chongshan, aren't you full?

757
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:42,889
Ke.

758
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,949
I have something urgent to do.

759
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,310
I have to go now.

760
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,730
Didn't you say you only put
poison in one bowl?

761
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:55,590
How come my stomach is aching too?

762
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,470
Xianxian, you must have lost your memory.

763
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,020
Just see how much you ate.

764
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,650
You have a stomachache, huh?

765
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,130
You guys enjoy it.

766
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,540
See you next time.

767
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,460
Lu, I'm starving.

768
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,230
Let's find something else to eat. Come on.

769
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:11,670
Okay.

770
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,220
Sir, put it on my tab.

771
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,620
Okay.

772
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,520
Lu, I want to drink this.

773
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,400
Lu.

774
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,320
Ke.

775
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:35,130
We're just shopping today.
Let's not talk about other things.

776
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:40,960
Okay.

777
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,360
Lu!

778
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,520
Lu.

779
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,680
Lu, what's wrong?

780
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,490
Help! Someone fainted!

781
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,210
Save him!

782
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,360
Help!

783
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,510
Why did someone poison him before I could?

784
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:07,010
Guess I'm not needed again this time.

785
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,190
Lu!

786
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:21,030
[As Eternal as the Sun and the Moon]

787
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,150
Why hasn't the doctor
finished checking on him after so long?

788
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,530
Cousin, calm down.

789
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,490
Mr. Lu will be surely fine.

790
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,570
He was poisoned in broad daylight.

791
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,790
Mr. Lu must have offended someone,

792
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,680
so he suffered this misfortune.

793
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,960
Why are you looking at me like that?

794
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,720
Father, when our family was in trouble,

795
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:41,650
Lu helped me manage the ancestral hall.

796
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,160
Also, when you guys were in prison,

797
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,460
he was the one who bribed the jailers

798
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,960
so that you could live better in prison.

799
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,820
What's more...

800
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,630
The incident of the Military Headquarters
losing the stolen goods

801
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,290
was probably related to him, too.

802
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,560
I can't tell my father.

803
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,680
What if it brings him trouble?

804
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,640
To save me, he shielded me form the knife.

805
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,320
I can't tell my father about this, either.

806
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,900
My father might be worried.

807
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,650
Anyway, he has been helping me.

808
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,190
Regarding what happened in the prison,

809
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,840
wasn't Xian the one
who bribed the jailers?

810
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,780
Did Lu Chi say that himself?

811
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,800
Lu is not someone
who would expect requital for favors.

812
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,460
He is just a warm-hearted man.

813
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,120
I've been observing his words and deeds

814
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,510
by his side.

815
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,510
I can figure out the truth roughly.

816
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,590
I have to ask Xianxian
to catch this bad guy.

817
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,050
I won't let him off easily!

818
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,800
No need to believe in what he said.

819
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,320
Doctor, this way please.

820
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:25,640
Okay.

821
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,820
[As Eternal as the Sun and the Moon]

822
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,650
Doctor, how is he?

823
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,370
He was poisoned.

824
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,320
Although the poison is not fatal,

825
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,680
it's very strange.

826
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,030
I'm afraid it's...

827
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,070
What is it?

828
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,360
I'm afraid it has hurt his consciousness,

829
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,830
so he can't wake up soon.

830
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,590
I've prepared a prescription.

831
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,180
Take good care of him.

832
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,480
I shall take my leave.

833
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,640
Doctor, bye.

834
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,950
Mother, to save me, Lu was poisoned.

835
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,730
We have to take good care of him

836
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:52,790
until he recovers.

837
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,680
Daughter,

838
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:56,590
I promise you

839
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,280
I will find that culprit.

840
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:58,920
However,

841
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,230
just let Mr. Lu go back
to his own home first.

842
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,440
He just lives next door, doesn't he?

843
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,840
How... How about sending him
to the hospital?

844
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,840
What do you think?

845
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,030
Mother.

846
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,870
If Lu hadn't saved me,

847
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,150
I would be the one lying inside now.

848
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,400
-You wouldn't.
-He saved my life.

849
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,870
How can we be so ungrateful?

850
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:13,850
Ke.

851
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,560
Calm down.

852
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,060
Let's go inside to check on Mr. Lu first.

853
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,800
Chongshan.

854
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,720
Why are you hiding?

855
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,680
Come here.

856
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,880
Tell me the truth.

857
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,590
Why is the powder

858
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,630
so similar to the white powder

859
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,870
on Mr. Lu's clothes?

860
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:47,750
You...

861
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,560
Did you poison him?

862
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,920
Father, explain this for me.

863
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,780
Huai, do you know the truth too?

864
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,230
Explain this for me.

865
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,170
What could I say?

866
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,120
Well, Dear, don't be angry.

867
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,480
Here's the thing.

868
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,610
Lu has always been with Ke.

869
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,150
I've warned him before.

870
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:09,960
If he had listened to me,

871
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,400
there would be no conflicts between us.

872
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,480
But he behaved more recklessly

873
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,800
and didn't restrain himself at all.

874
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,710
So I asked Chongshan

875
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:17,270
to put a bit of the knockout drug
in his food.

876
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,110
It's not poison. It's really not poison.

877
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:19,970
He deserved it.

878
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,730
You...

879
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,830
So you two did this?

880
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,480
Xianxian must have
been involved in this, too.

881
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:30,250
Yes, yes.

882
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,290
Huai, are you out of your mind?

883
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:33,030
[As Eternal as the Sun and the Moon]

884
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,150
You even suggested sending him back home?

885
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,190
After we send him back home,

886
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,920
what if he sues you guys

887
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,130
for hurting him?

888
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:39,800
Hurting him?

889
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,330
H-He wouldn't do that, huh?

890
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,060
From now on,

891
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,610
take good good care of Mr. Lu

892
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:46,670
until he recovers.

893
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,050
Then sincerely apologize
to him and repent.

894
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,580
After he recovers,

895
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,400
just see how I'll teach you guys a lesson.

896
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,530
Got it, Mother.

897
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:57,360
[As Eternal as the Sun and the Moon]

898
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,620
Chongshan, come here.

899
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:02,630
I told you not to put too much in it.

900
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,160
Did you put too much in it?

901
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,380
Just a little.

902
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,450
Lu, I will take care of you.

903
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:10,290
You have to recover soon.

904
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,690
Though you didn't tell me, I know

905
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,450
you were the one who saved me every time.

906
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,100
Why are you guys here?

907
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,320
I brought your two brothers here

908
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,780
to apologize to you.

909
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,970
Say something. Say something.

910
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,580
-Ke, it's our fault.
-Ke, it's our fault.

911
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,810
Your fault?

912
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,390
You guys poisoned him, didn't you?

913
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,290
No.

914
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:58,510
What poison did you put?

915
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,840
Don't you know it might kill him?

916
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,040
We didn't poison him.

917
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:03,850
We just put a bit
of the knockout drug in his food.

918
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,630
You...

919
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,480
It's not fatal. Don't worry.

920
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,510
How about this, Ke?

921
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,160
I'll ask your two brothers
to take care of him.

922
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,460
Go back to your room
for a rest first. Okay?

923
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,100
No.

924
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,840
I'll take care of my own friend.

925
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,920
Ke, you're not married yet.

926
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,840
You can't take care of the man
who isn't your family.

927
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,030
If this news gets out,

928
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:18,580
well...

929
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,590
You both will have difficulty
getting married.

930
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:23,850
Yeah, you still need to care about
your reputation, right?

931
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:27,030
Shen Tongyun has a crush on Lu,

932
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,250
and Lu hasn't given me a reply yet.

933
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,500
What if this gets out?

934
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:31,920
Alright.

935
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,780
Take good care of him.

936
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,180
If anything bad happens to him,

937
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,230
I won't talk to you anymore.

938
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,430
-Don't worry.
-Okay.

939
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,150
Go back to your room for a rest.

940
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,090
Be good.

941
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,490
Go back to your room.

942
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,180
Take good care of him.

943
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,710
Alright. Be good.

944
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:51,380
Father, did we put too much
medicine in his food?

945
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,750
I've just asked Chongshan about it.

946
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,010
Did you put too much medicine in his food?

947
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,190
[Shi's Mansion]

948
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,700
Why hasn't he woken up yet?

949
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,230
Did you not take good care of him?

950
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,960
It's not like that. Look at him.

951
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,550
It's not like that at all.

952
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,700
Lu.

953
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:36,550
Lu.

954
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,220
Lu.

955
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,360
You're awake.

956
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,390
Great!

957
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,210
Xianxian, Chongshan, he's awake.

958
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,710
It's good that you're awake.

959
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:51,960
Xianxian, Chongshan, hurry up.

960
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,740
Take him back home now.

961
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,750
Okay.

962
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,500
Little girl.

963
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,270
Mr. Lu.
