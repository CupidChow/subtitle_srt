My wife is now pregnant.

our gratitude to Marriage Broker Shi.

you're being too modest.

you have much of her flair.

Marriage Broker Deng strongly urged me
to divorce my wife,

31
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,750
which showed that in this agency,

32
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,910

to mediate between you two.

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,550
Chief Matchmaker Tao
used to host it every year.

551
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,510
Our Xibao Pavilion

552
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,350
has always contributed some money.

553
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,720
Firstly, it's due to
Chief Matchmaker Tao's good morality.

554
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,790
Secondly, we're grateful for the patronage
of the Official Matchmaking Agency.

555
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,760
Miss Shi,

556
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,150
how much money do you need this year?

557
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,480
Just tell me the amount.

558
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,590
Pan'er.

559
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,920
I'm really not trying to
ask for money here.

560
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,360
I...

561
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,460
Then why do you

562
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,910
look so troubled?

563
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,110
I...

564
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,880
I want to host the Flower Assembly

565
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,610
on behalf of my mother this time

566
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,840
to make her happy.

567
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,640
Pan'er.

568
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,960
I still have something to do.

569
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,990
I have to go now.

570
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,610
Miss Shi.

571
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:09,710
Master.

572
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,200
Miss Shi is facing some difficulties.

573
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,770
How should we help her?

574
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,200
Convert all the silver
we've collected recently into bank notes

575
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,000
and bring them back as reserve funds.

576
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,460
Also,
ask Lu Yi to follow Miss Shi at all times

577
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,000
to see what difficulties she's facing

578
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,240
and report them to me promptly.

579
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:23,900
However...

580
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,030
Don't let her find out about it.

581
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:26,590
Yes.

582
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,430
[He's Bakery]

583
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,640
I heard their pastries
are quite delicious.

584
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,210
Right?

585
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,960
You haven't tasted them before?

586
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,290
Buy some and taste them.

587
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,230
Really? Then I'll buy some, too.

588
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:45,240
Is Ketian still angry with me?

589
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,770
Forget it.

590
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:52,400
I'd better ask Chongshan
to check things out here first.

591
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,350
Ke!

592
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,720
Please wrap them up nicely for me.

593
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,440
Okay.

594
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,030
Please wait a moment.

595
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,450
No need to trouble Chongshan.

596
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,090
I'm not that petty-minded.

597
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,550
Let's go.

598
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:05,990
They will taste better with some tea.

599
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:08,590
[He's Bakery]

600
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,540
Kexian.

601
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,320
Ke.

602
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,030
It's been a long time
since your last visit.

603
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,760
I was afraid
Ketian was still angry with me.

604
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,900
I'm not that petty-minded.

605
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,880
I shouldn't have

606
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,160
thought of you as a petty-minded person.

607
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,550
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

608
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,880
Well, I'll reluctantly

609
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,450
forgive you this time.

610
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,620
By the way, I've heard
you've been raising money lately.

611
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,470
Why didn't you come to us?

612
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,160
It's my own business.

613
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:43,190
I didn't want to trouble you two.

614
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,440
At least, you have a conscience.

615
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,700
Well, Ke, what are you talking about?

616
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,090
We're like a family.

617
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,170
Just tell us if you need anything.

618
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,310
If you don't come to us,

619
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,630
we'll really be angry.

620
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,480
It's because of the Flower Assembly.

621
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,450
Don't worry.

622
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,000
I'll make them for you on time.

623
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,800
And I'll give you a 20% discount.

624
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,370
But I don't have money to pay the bill.

625
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,110
Never mind.

626
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,510
It's not a large amount of money anyway.

627
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,310
He's Bakery will cover the cost.

628
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,230
Don't worry, Ke.

629
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,440
Since Ketian has said so,

630
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,040
there won't be any problems.

631
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,580
But it's still not enough.

632
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,760
How come it's still not enough?

633
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,540
Well,

634
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,980
have you asked your Chief Lu?

635
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,970
No.

636
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,120
It's not quite convenient.

637
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:40,830
Ke.

638
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,140
Remember.

639
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,350
We are a family.

640
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,440
Just tell us if you need anything.

641
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,170
No, no, no.

642
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,480
The Flower Assembly
requires too much money.

643
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,480
Even if you two could give me money,

644
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,080
it still wouldn't be enough.

645
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,960
But it's Marriage Broker Deng's duty

646
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,870
to raise money, isn't it?

647
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,520
This time,

648
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,920
I want to host the Flower Assembly
on behalf of my mother,

649
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,190
so I need enough money

650
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,590
to get a chance.

651
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,450
Besides having enough money,

652
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:11,310
the Flower Assembly is always hosted
by the Chief Matchmaker.

653
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:11,980
But you...

654
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,100
I know.

655
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,850
I'll go back
to the Official Matchmaking Agency now.

656
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,490
Kexian.

657
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,400
Ke.

658
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,880
So you went to the Xibao Pavilion?

659
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,080
How did you know?

660
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,810
Chief Lu is here.

661
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,680
He's talking with Marriage Broker Deng.

662
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,410
Who else could it be except you?

663
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:47,920
Why did Lu suddenly come to
the Official Matchmaking Agency?

664
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,920
Why is he even talking so enthusiastically
with Chief Matchmaker Deng?

665
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,180
Marriage Broker Deng, could you tell me

666
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,830
how much money is needed
for the Flower Assembly?

667
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,890
How much is the agency still short of?

668
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,200
We need 20,000 taels.

669
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,950
There's a shortfall of about 18,000 taels.

670
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,460
I'm willing to contribute 10,000 taels.

671
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,280
10,000 taels?

672
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,780
Lu is...

673
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,120
Are you serious?

674
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,970
I won't break my promise.

675
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:16,230
However, I have a small request.

676
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,440
Chief Lu, since you're so generous,

677
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,150
please tell us your request.

678
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,590
I've heard the Flower Assembly
is almost the same every year.

679
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,150
Since I'll contribute the money this year,

680
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,810
I'd like to see something new.

681
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,050
What do you mean by that, Chief Lu?

682
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,780
It's just the literal meaning.

683
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,720
I want to spend money on something I like.

684
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,960
The capable person should be in charge.

685
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,110
Let's select the organizer
of the Flower Assembly by a competition.

686
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,580
Whoever has the best ideas
will be in charge.

687
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,120
Lu is clearly helping me.

688
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,130
But Chief Lu, you need to understand that

689
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,110
the Flower Assembly

690
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:56,380
is usually organized
by the Chief Matchmaker.

691
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,630
Chief Lu,

692
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:00,620
this approach goes against our tradition.

693
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:01,930
Besides,

694
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,740
which one here do you think

695
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,220
would be willing to compete against me,
the Chief Matchmaker?

696
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:19,340
In that case, just forget it.

697
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,350
Who said no one is willing to do that?

698
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,640
I'm willing to compete.

699
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,560
Chief Lu, please stay.

700
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,720
Since you're so generous,

701
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,360
we can certainly discuss this further.

702
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,220
Alright.

703
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,960
Why don't we hold a competition?

704
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,370
Kexian.

705
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,810
Why are you here?

706
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:05,150
Well, Ketian noticed
that you were in low spirits,

707
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,590
so she asked me to bring you some desserts
to cheer you up.

708
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:10,250
Kexian,
I'm so lucky to have you and Ketian.

709
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,860
How's it going?

710
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,429
If I want to host the Flower Assembly,

711
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:21,570
what are my chances
of defeating Marriage Broker Deng?

712
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,870
I don't know.

713
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,880
But if you want to
host the Flower Assembly,

714
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,179
I'll do everything in my power to help you

715
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,070
and make your wish come true.

716
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,960
Besides, you've learned so well
from Aunt Tao.

717
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,360
I'm sure you can organize it properly.

718
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,230
You're right.

719
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,800
I am my mother's daughter.

720
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,199
I can definitely do this.

721
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,590
Kexian, I'll take these desserts.

722
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,070
I'll prepare for it carefully.

723
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:44,520
Okay.

the naming right in the Flower Assembly.]

727
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,550
Today, you and I are gathered here

728
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,150
to raise funds for the Flower Assembly.

729
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,940
Of course, the money
can't be donated for nothing.

730

We still need to hear the opinions
of our two marriage brokers

00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,870
to see if you all are willing to
contribute the money,

732
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,560
how much you're willing to offer

733
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,160
and which of them
you want to spend the money on.

734
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,620
So, let's begin.

735
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,610
Which of you would like to start first?

736
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,880
Shi Fa'ke, you may start first,

737
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,360
as I don't want others to blame me
for bullying my junior.

738
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,650
Everyone,

739
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,800
if I am entrusted with this position,

740
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,360
all those who contribute to
the Official Matchmaking Agency

741
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,150
can use this opportunity
to gain wide recognition.

742
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,670
By that time at the Flower Assembly,

743
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,320
everyone will see the names
of your distinguished shops.

744
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,110
Your shops will surely become famous.

745
00:35:59,110 --> 00:35:59,740
That sounds wonderful.

746
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,510
This is something good.

747
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,190
Indeed.

748
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,150
Your shops will not only be famous
throughout the capital

749
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,680
but also be included in

750
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,010
the Top Recommended List
for the procurement

751
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:08,070
of the Official Matchmaking Agency.

752
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,880
What is this Top Recommended List?

753
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,490
Yeah.

754
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,630
When the Official Matchmaking Agency
purchases betrothal gifts and dowries,

755
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,550
it'll surely prioritize collaboration

756
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,430
with shops that have invested.

757
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:19,730
So there will be quite a lot of business?

758
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,110
If Marriage Broker Shi is in charge,

759
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,360
He's Bakery is willing to
contribute a year's revenue

760
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,920
to support the Flower Assembly.

761
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,370
A year's revenue?

762
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,650
That's very generous.

763
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,790
We don't have that much cash.

764
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:33,010
We're preparing to open a branch store.

765
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,800
Let's support Ke's dream first.

766
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,030
Money can be earned again.

767
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,260
But that's not very realistic.

768
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,240
We have the intention but not the ability.

769
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,250
I'm the manager of He's Bakery.

770
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,360
I won't allow you to take such a big risk.

771
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:43,890
Ketian.

772
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,590
If Marriage Broker Shi is in charge,

773
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,440
He's Bakery is willing to
contribute half a year's revenue,

774
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,550
1,500 taels.

775
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,370
Ketian.

776
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,230
If He's Bakery is willing to
contribute 1,500 taels,

777
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,160
then He's Bakery

778
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:02,400
will be the Official Matchmaking Agency's
preferred partner for wedding cakes.

779
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,880
All the desserts needed
for the wedding celebrations

780
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,960
of the Official Matchmaking Agency

781
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,670
will be purchased from He's Bakery.

782
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,720
Good! Good! Good!

783
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,670
Good! Good! Good!

784
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:12,690
Impressive!

785
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,720
Also,

786
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,800
whoever invests the most
in the Flower Assembly this time

787
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,800
can gain the naming right.

788
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:25,620
For example,
if Xibao Pavilion invests the most,

789
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,320
then the Flower Assembly this time

790
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,510
will be called the Xibao Flower Assembly.

791
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,440
And there's only one opportunity.

792
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,990
Shi Fa'ke.

793
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,860
Why are you trying so hard
to fawn on Chief Lu?

794
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,280
Don't forget that

795
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,900
I am the Chief Matchmaker.

796
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,710
I can also do all these things
you've mentioned.

797
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:45,190
So you'd better tell us

798
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,800
your plans for the Flower Assembly now.

799
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,060
Yes, that makes sense.

800
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,230
The Flower Assembly is held every year.

801
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,920
But if we do it the same way as before,

802
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,550
with unmarried men and women
separated by screens,

803
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,810
how boring it would be.

804
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,790
So this time, we must make some changes.

805
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:01,230
So what would you like to do,
Marriage Broker Shi?

806
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,360
What changes could you possibly make?

807
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,250
I wonder if she has any good ideas.

808
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,370
Let's hear it.

809
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,710
Everyone, please look.

810
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,510
By that time at the Flower Assembly,

811
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,040
in front of each young lady,

812
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:16,550
there will be a glass lamp
with her name engraved on it.

813
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:19,920
Then each young gentleman
will present himself on stage by turns.

814
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,710
The ladies can learn about
the gentlemen's talents,

815
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,430
interests and mannerisms

816
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,710
before deciding
whether to keep their lamps lit or not.

817
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,310
A lit lamp means preference.

818
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,480
An extinguished one means dispreference.

819
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,340
The lady who keeps her lamp lit
may arrange to talk with the gentleman.

820
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,480
What if multiple ladies

821
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,590
are interested in the same gentleman?

822
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,510
What will happen then?

823
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,390
Yes, yes.

824
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,680
Then the gentleman may choose one lady

825
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,190
and ask her a few questions

826
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,850
before deciding
which one he wants to talk with.

827
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,850
This is utterly absurd!

828
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,960
Men and women will choose each other

829
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,020
and then meet privately afterwards?

830
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,720
How inappropriate!

831
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,480
Marriage Broker Deng,
why are you in such a hurry to oppose it?

832
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,190
I think
Marriage Broker Shi's idea is excellent.

833
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,800
Since the gifts are so exquisite,

834
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,440
I think all young ladies and gentlemen

835
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,440
like them, right?

836
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:08,840
Also,

837
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,830
I've designed some small games

838
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,730
to provide more options

839
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,230
for those who don't want marriages

840
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,070
so that the Flower Assembly
can become a grand event,

841
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,400
which buzzes with
people and a lively atmosphere.

842
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,670
It can also help to avoid suspicion.

843
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:21,170
How dare you treat marriage
so frivolously?

844
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:24,190
So, Marriage Broker Deng,
what have you prepared?

845
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,550
Please share your ideas with everyone.

846
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,160
In my opinion,

847
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,840
marriage must
prioritize parental approval.

848
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,750
I think at the Flower Assembly this time,

849
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:36,410
we must invite the parents or elders
from each family to attend it.

850
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,280
With their parents there,

851
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,230
how can the young people feel comfortable
getting to know each other?

852
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,110
After all,
it's the young people's marriage.

853
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,150
Their own wishes
are surely the most important.

854
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,080
They'll make their own decisions?

855
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,120
Let me ask you.

856
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:51,030
So what if young men and women

857
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,030
fancy each other?

858
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,360
They have no authority
to settle a marriage agreement.

859
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,170
Their parents have to be there

860
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,760
with the presence of marriage brokers
from the Official Matchmaking Agency.

861
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,030
That's the only way of respecting
parental wishes and matchmakers' words.

862
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,400
This is killing two birds with one stone.

863
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,660
Don't you understand?

864
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,240
Don't you all agree?

865
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,430
That's right.

866
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,920
Marriage Broker Deng's words make sense.

867
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,110
Marriage Broker Deng's words
are very reasonable.

868
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,510
Indeed. Although it's a good idea,

869
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:16,300
it doesn't conform to proper etiquette.

870
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,840
This is about mutual affection
between men and women.

871
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,800
Why do we have to insist on
the presence of parents?

872
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,620
Indeed. Liu's words make sense.

873
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,660
What both sides said makes sense.

874
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,650
Why don't we

875
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,370
let the shop owners here vote to decide?

876
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,580
Lu Chi.

877
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:35,950
Ke's design is clearly more innovative
and interesting.

878
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:38,590
But you still want to
make things difficult for her with a vote.

879
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:40,550
Even if you and Ke were just strangers,

880
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,110
you should still speak
with your conscience.

881
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,770
I only speak for what's right.

882
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,800
What's more,
the minority submits to the majority.

883
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,930
That can't be wrong.

884
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,840
What Chief Lu said makes sense.

885
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,680
I'm glad
Marriage Broker Deng agrees with me.

886
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,980
Kexian, just forget it.

887
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,110
Stop giving Chief Lu a hard time.

888
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,770
What he said makes sense, too.

889
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,000
Since you both have no objections,

890
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,690
Ms. Li, please prepare for it.

891
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,560
Ladies and gentlemen, please choose

892
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,690
the organizer you want

893
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,630
and the amount of investment.

894
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:20,360
The number of votes
is determined by the amount of investment.

895
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,820
The one with the most votes

896
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:25,130
will be the organizer
of the Flower Assembly this time.

897
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,480
Shi Fa'ke.

898
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,910
Chief Lu is truly a shrewd man.

899
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,120
What he says can't be wrong.
