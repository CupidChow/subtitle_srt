Father and I have treated you well.

Why are you doing this?

00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,360
Treated me well?

10
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,820
That's the funniest thing

11
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,290
I've heard today.

12
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,210
We were both born of the Emperor.

13
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:23,150
By order of birth,

14
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,560
I should have been the emperor.

15
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,010
But because of my mother's status,

16
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:32,100
Father sent me to live with Aunt.

17
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,840
I never even had the chance
to call him Father.

18

And you?

19
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,650
You stole what was rightfully mine.

If anything,

it is I
who treated you both quite generously!

22
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,360
So all these years,

23
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,430
you've been resentful
because Father refused to acknowledge you.

24
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,960
That's why you did all this,

25
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,800
including Lord Zhu's death.

26

replaced her with Marriage Broker Deng,

32

and made
the Official Matchmaking Agency mine.

33
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,560
Then, I arranged several marriages

Let me out!

745
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,120
I need to see Father!

746
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,970
Guards! Release me!

747
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,030
-Do not let anyone near the princess.
-I want to see Father!

748
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:17,940
-Let me out!
-Yes sir.

749
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,720
Yes sir.

750
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,850
[Xibao Pavilion]

751
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:23,670
Ms. Li is preparing for her wedding soon.

752
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,230
Lu Yi.

753
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,130
Keep a close eye on the store

754
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,010
and don't slack.

755
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,540
Yes, Master, rest assured.

756
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,700
Ms. Li,

757
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,930
just focus on marrying Mr. Shi.

758
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,840
Thank you for your understanding, Master.

759
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,640
When it's your turn with Qin'er,

760
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,680
I'll help take on your load as well.

761
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,720
Her and I...

762
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,990
Brother Lu!

763
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,970
Ke, you're here.

764
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,000
Something's wrong.

765
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,780
Qiyue is missing.

766
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,290
Ke, don't panic.

767
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,630
Lu Yi, Ms. Li,

768
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:52,910
send people to search.

769
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:53,630
-Yes.
-Yes.

770
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,050
Brother Lu, nothing bad
will happen to Qiyue, right?

771
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,590
Don't worry, Ke.

772
00:39:58,610 --> 00:39:59,600
She'll be fine.

773
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,140
I'll go with you to find her.

774
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:01,880
Let's go.

775
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,910
Ke.

776
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,780
Guards! Quickly!

777
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,370
Envoy, I agree to the marriage alliance.

778
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,170
I agree to the marriage alliance!

779
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:23,970
Open the door.

780
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,560
Princess, you've seen the light.

781
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,240
Princess, I congratulate you
on your awakening

782
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,650
and agreeing to the marriage alliance.

783
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:36,510
Princess, don't blame me.

784
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,880
I'm just following orders.

785
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,880
Cut the nonsense.

786
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,650
I've already agreed,

787
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,110
now let me go immediately.

788
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,190
Princess, before your marriage,

789
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,740
do not entertain other thoughts.

790
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,460
We have people stationed everywhere,

791
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,010
Princess, you won't be able to escape.

792
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,740
Trying to force your way out
would be futile.

793
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,680
I won't run.

794
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,380
But I have one condition.

795
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:54,410
What condition?

796
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,280
As long as you
agree to the marriage alliance,

797
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,680
I will do my utmost
to satisfy your request.

798
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,410
According to the capital's customs,

799
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:03,010
I need a marriage broker
for my marriage alliance.

800
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:06,210
I want Shi Fa'ke,
the best marriage broker in the capital.

801
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,830
Shi Fa'ke?

802
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:08,900
Go now!

803
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,500
Yes, I'll go right away.

804
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:13,470
Close the door.

805
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,630
Ke, only you can save me now.

806
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,120
Sir,
take a look at our freshly brewed wine.

807
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,640
Candied haws!

808
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:30,410
Small pendants, little trinkets!

809
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,070
Candied haws, sweet and sour.

810
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,530
Would you like to try some?

811
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,720
Ke, shall I take you home first?

812
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,080
It's getting late.

813
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,320
We can continue searching tomorrow.

814
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:50,920
I'm fine,

815
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,100
I can keep looking.

816
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:53,400
Brother Lu,

817
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,420
do you think Qiyue is okay?

818
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,380
Maybe we should check the outskirts.

819
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,040
Ke.

820
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,100
I've already sent Lu Yi to search
the outskirts,

821
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,300
Don't worry too much.

822
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,400
She might have gone home already,

823
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,320
Let me take you home first.

824
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,590
You're right,

825
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,420
let's go home and check.

826
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:11,970
Come.

827
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,470
Come, I'll carry you.

828
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:23,990
Up you go.

829
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,010
Quick.
