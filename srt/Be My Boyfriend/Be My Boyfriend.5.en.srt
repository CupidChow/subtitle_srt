7
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,660

No, it's not spying...

How many days have you gone without eating?

80
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,292
Three days.

81
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:17,542
Do you want some water?

82
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:20,597
I just barely got to 44.7 kg.

83
00:06:20,597 --> 00:06:24,153
If I drink water, I'll go over 45 kg.

84
00:06:24,153 --> 00:06:28,299
Why is that so important to you?

85
00:06:28,299 --> 00:06:31,278
Yeah. Why?

86
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:33,540
Are you going to ask why I care about how much I weigh?

87
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,908
And tell me that all that matters is what's inside?

88
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:39,180
How can I say that to you?

89
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,706
Everyone has different standards in life.

90
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,965
It's easy to know. The reason Lee Seungmin got angry.

91
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:51,483
- What is it?
-You did everything that he hates.

92
00:06:51,483 --> 00:06:52,740
First, kissing just to show someone.

93
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,688
If you can't believe me, I'll show you.

94
00:06:54,688 --> 00:06:56,237
Second, kissing without meaning it.

95
00:06:56,237 --> 00:06:58,442
Did you mean that kiss?

96
00:06:58,442 --> 00:07:01,123
Third, that happened to be his first kiss.

97
00:07:01,123 --> 00:07:02,805
Now do you believe me?

98
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:06,630
It was inconsiderate and insincere.

99
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:11,621
Everything about it was a lie.

100
00:07:11,621 --> 00:07:15,064
Wow! That was harsh.

101
00:07:15,064 --> 00:07:17,401
But, as his best friend,

102
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:20,140
I think this is what really ticked him off.

103
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,773
The second one.

104
00:07:22,773 --> 00:07:24,935
- Kissing without meaning it?
- Yes!

105
00:07:24,935 --> 00:07:27,714
He always puts sincerity first.

106
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,480
It's like he worships it.

107
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,536
Then, is that why he refused when I asked him to pretend to date me?

108
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:35,489
- Because it's not real?
- That's right.

109
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:39,342
You're so smart.

110
00:07:39,342 --> 00:07:42,183
But why did he suddenly change his mind?

111
00:07:42,183 --> 00:07:45,124
Because what he feels is real.

112
00:07:45,124 --> 00:07:49,384
- Huh?
- He thought that it would be okay as long as he really liked you so...

113
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:55,132
Whoa. That was supposed to be a secret.

114
00:07:55,132 --> 00:07:57,346
Hold on.

115
00:07:57,346 --> 00:08:01,096
Then do you mean that he's always liked me?

116
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:05,194
Yes, and since a long, long time ago.

117
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:17,034
Drink right after you weigh yourself. You might get dehydrated.

118
00:08:18,114 --> 00:08:20,565
Oh... thanks.

119
00:08:20,565 --> 00:08:22,957
You're really amazing.

120
00:08:22,957 --> 00:08:24,038
What?

121
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:27,512
Trying that hard to maintain yourself.

122
00:08:27,512 --> 00:08:32,024
Other people say that I'm going overboard...

123
00:08:32,024 --> 00:08:35,400
Why is that going overboard? You're protecting what you think is important.

124
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,424
That's cool.

125
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,811
That sounds like you think I should starve longer.

126
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,215
I'm just saying that you should cheer up.

127
00:08:43,215 --> 00:08:46,099
Oh, but don't starve anymore. You'll hurt yourself.

128
00:08:46,099 --> 00:08:48,659
OK. You, too. Cheer up.

129
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:51,442
Me? Why?

130
00:08:51,442 --> 00:08:53,086
I'm sure you're going through a hard time, too.

131
00:08:53,086 --> 00:08:57,203
You have to pretend that you're someone's boyfriend even if you don't like her.

132
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,959
Oh that's...

133
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,516
Hanna! There you are!

134
00:09:02,516 --> 00:09:04,478
I've been looking for you everywhere.

135
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:07,787
- Come on, it's our turn.
- Yeah.

136
00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:22,435
I heard everything.

137
00:09:22,435 --> 00:09:25,220
I heard that you always liked me.

138
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,875
What?

139
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:31,192
I remember our contract saying that you shouldn't have indecent feelings.

140
00:09:32,928 --> 00:09:35,849
It's not indecent. It's real.

141
00:09:35,849 --> 00:09:38,026
That's not allowed either?

142
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:42,868
Why did you like me, and how long have you liked me?

143
00:09:42,868 --> 00:09:47,105
I fell for you because you looked so amazing singing.

144
00:09:47,105 --> 00:09:50,579
And I thought you looked pretty after that.

145
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:53,301
When I was singing?

146
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:57,040
In March, in the broadcast room.

147
00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:08,526
Are you finished?

148
00:10:09,523 --> 00:10:11,659
One more thing.

149
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:13,618
Go ahead.

150
00:10:14,723 --> 00:10:16,536
Earlier,

151
00:10:18,628 --> 00:10:21,980
kissing you like that.

152
00:10:23,148 --> 00:10:27,350
I'm really sorry. I really regret doing that.

153
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,035
If you're really sorry,

154
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:41,920
take it back and do it for real later.

155
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,234
Sincerely.

156
00:11:03,255 --> 00:11:04,936
Take it back

157
00:11:04,936 --> 00:11:07,530
and do it for real later.

158
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,462
And do it for real later.

159
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,965
Do it for real later.

160
00:11:15,148 --> 00:11:16,656
What's wrong with this?

161
00:11:16,656 --> 00:11:19,757
- What?
- Is it broken again?

162
00:11:19,757 --> 00:11:22,451
I think this is broken.

163
00:11:22,451 --> 00:11:25,063
Do you have high blood pressure? Or arrhythmia?

164
00:11:25,063 --> 00:11:27,804
Why is your heart beating so fast?

165
