[2020 Spring] 
The song started, but where is the MR version?

00:00:04,491 --> 00:00:05,399
Hey, Lee Seungmin!

5
00:00:05,399 --> 00:00:06,926
You said you checked earlier.

6
00:00:06,926 --> 00:00:08,844
I definitely checked earlier...

7
00:00:08,844 --> 00:00:11,443
You are driving me crazy.

8
00:00:11,443 --> 00:00:14,815
If you don't have it, I can sing it without.

00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:23,380
♫  That day I first met you ♫

10
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:29,740
♫  Afterwards, every day, I ♫

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:37,980
♫  Looked toward you ♫

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,724
That day I saw Oh Jina for the first time, she was breathtakingly awesome.

13
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,960
♫  My mind that yearned for you ♫

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,670
I couldn't help but immediately fall in love with her.

15
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,535
But...

16
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,230
You...

17
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,680
You have to be my boyfriend.

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,072
What? Boyfriend?

19
00:01:02,072 --> 00:01:05,596
What did I hear just now?

20
00:01:07,445 --> 00:01:08,235
Yes.

21
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,440
You're probably wondering what you've just heard.

22
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,814
I'm not just anybody after all.

I'm Oh Jina.

24

I know.

25
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:17,929
Why would Oh Jina ask me...

26
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:19,443
Do you have a girlfriend?

27
00:01:19,443 --> 00:01:21,463
No...

28
00:01:21,463 --> 00:01:23,922
That's good.

29
00:01:23,922 --> 00:01:26,455
So, what you are saying is...

30
00:01:26,455 --> 00:01:31,044
You are asking me out, right?

31
00:01:31,044 --> 00:01:32,209
Um...

32
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:34,335
I guess you can say that.

33
00:01:34,335 --> 00:01:36,495
But what about Koo Hyungtak?

34
00:01:36,495 --> 00:01:38,321
I thought you two were in a relationship.

35
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:41,521
We broke up this morning.

36
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:43,334
Then... By any chance,

37
00:01:43,334 --> 00:01:46,479
did you break up because of me?

38
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,000
Because you like me?

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,530
What? Me like you? I just learned who you are today.

40

If you don't like me...

42
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,685
Why did you make the love confession?

43
00:02:01,685 --> 00:02:04,581
It's not a confession. It's a proposal.

44
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:07,167
It will only be for a little while.

45
00:02:09,343 --> 00:02:10,528
Hm...

46
00:02:10,528 --> 00:02:12,475
So...

47
00:02:12,475 --> 00:02:16,484
You know how in some dramas, the main characters have a contract relationship?

48
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:21,227
Just think of it as you being in a drama.

49
00:02:21,227 --> 00:02:25,681
So you're asking for a contractual relationship with me?

50
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:28,384
Yes, that's right.

51
00:02:28,384 --> 00:02:29,310
Ah...

52
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,763
Can you do that for me?

53

Huh?

54

Well...

55
00:02:43,065 --> 00:02:44,425
I don't think so.

No way!

58

I was never this embarrassed in my life.

59
00:02:50,438 --> 00:02:51,847

What should we do then?

64
00:02:56,741 --> 00:03:00,014
You promised Koo Hyungtak that you would introduce him tomorrow.

65

This is a hidden camera prank.

It was a good hidden camera, friend.

And let's tell each other whenever you have a problem.

171
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:38,932
I always wanted that.

172
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:41,636
And we need matching couple items, too.

173
00:08:41,636 --> 00:08:44,654
You have so many things you want.

174
00:08:44,654 --> 00:08:47,775
OK, you can do everything you want.

175
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:51,606
It's not like we're having a real relationship.

176
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:56,324
Here, sign.

177
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:01,329
What now?

178
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:04,016
What's the problem now?

179
00:09:06,155 --> 00:09:08,435
When did you get so big, my son?

180
00:09:08,435 --> 00:09:11,533
[2 years ago]
I still need more time to grow.

181
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:19,043
I think I lived my life so well.

182
00:09:19,946 --> 00:09:22,033
I raised my son so well.

183
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:23,947
Right?

184
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,000
Even if I am not here with you in the future...

185
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,030
You always have to live an honest life.

186
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,070
You promise?

187
00:09:46,965 --> 00:09:50,408
OK... And please stop saying that.

188
00:10:04,835 --> 00:10:05,965
I will give you 10 minutes.

189
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:07,725
Sign it and come down.

190
00:10:07,725 --> 00:10:09,045
You have to be there.

191
00:10:09,045 --> 00:10:10,954
I trust you, OK?

192
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:19,711
What is it? What?

193
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:20,851
Did you sign the contract?

194
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:22,356
You decided to do it?

195
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:24,458
Not yet...

196
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,676
Take pictures with Jina.

197
00:10:25,676 --> 00:10:26,591
Walk her home...

198
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:28,558
Eat lunch together...

199
00:10:28,558 --> 00:10:29,651
Hey...

200
00:10:29,651 --> 00:10:31,651
This is definitely a miracle. More than getting 100% on the college entrance exam.

201
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:32,931
Are you really going to miss this chance?

202
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:34,588
I want to do it, too.

203
00:10:34,588 --> 00:10:36,023
You know...

204
00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:39,059
You know how much I like her.

205
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:40,115
Hey, friend.

206
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:42,962
Just think about it simply. You're genuine about this.

207
00:10:42,962 --> 00:10:44,945
That means it's real.

208
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:46,868
This relationship, too.

209
00:10:48,312 --> 00:10:50,177
When are they coming?

210
00:10:50,177 --> 00:10:52,382
Just be patient.

211
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:56,750
Jina is here.

212
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,700
Why are you alone?

213
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,968
Where's your new boyfriend?

214
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,270
He will come soon.

215
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,803
If he doesn't show up in 1 minute...

216
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,344
I will take that as we're back in the relationship.

217
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,800
If only I genuinely mean it...

218
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,525
Can this contract become a real relationship?

219
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:26,488
What should we do?

220
00:11:26,488 --> 00:11:28,786
It's been more than 1 minute.

221
00:11:28,786 --> 00:11:31,861
Let's make up, OK?

222
00:11:31,861 --> 00:11:33,641
Stop it, Koo Hyungtak.

223
00:11:33,641 --> 00:11:36,749
Jina doesn't want you.

224
00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:38,610
Ha...

225
00:11:42,485 --> 00:11:43,710
Then...

226
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:47,037
I will take this awesome chance and

227
00:11:47,037 --> 00:11:50,420
I will start this contractual relationship from today.

228
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,545
Jina.

229
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,931
I will never disappoint you ever again.

230
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:56,616
Huh?

231
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:58,754
Please don't be mad.

232
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,380
Jina.

233
00:12:15,925 --> 00:12:17,870
What?

234
00:12:23,615 --> 00:12:27,376
Hello, this is Jina's boyfriend, Lee Seungmin.

235
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:35,190
This relationship will become real anyway.

236
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,770

A shocking real story.

238
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,052
Did you try to avoid me?

239
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:54,945
Be careful.
