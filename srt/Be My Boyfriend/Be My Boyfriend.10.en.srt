1
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,980
Consider yourself lucky.

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,512
Why?

3
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:12,187
Never mind.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,630
You should consider yourself lucky.

5
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:18,440
Right now,

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,243
I'm trying my best to hold back.

7
00:00:36,513 --> 00:00:38,406
Wow.

8
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,550
Seong Hanna.

9
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,864
What's wrong?

10
00:00:55,864 --> 00:00:57,124
Did something happen?

11
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:59,628
It's disgusting.

12
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,440
What is it?

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,180
It was supposed to be a contract, and now they're acting like it's real.

14
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,853
Contract?

15
00:01:07,853 --> 00:01:09,819
What do you mean?

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,940
Jina and Seungmin.

17
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,160
They are in a contract relationship.

18
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,980
Contract relationship?

19
00:01:21,228 --> 00:01:22,688
[I have a stomachache from the spicy food. Could you go to the pharmacy with me?]
- I just saw this now.

20
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,814
Bawool said he has some medicine.

21
00:01:31,545 --> 00:01:33,026
Wow.

22
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,960
A contract relationship.

23
00:01:38,721 --> 00:01:40,480
Ta-da!

24
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,600
It looks so good!

25
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:51,116
Isn't it good?

26
00:01:51,116 --> 00:01:52,599
Wow.

27
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:55,059
It's really good!

28
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,926
You should taste this.

29
00:02:00,197 --> 00:02:02,298
Say "ahh."

30
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,900
Are you going out?

31
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,530
What?

32
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,955
How did you know?

33
00:02:13,955 --> 00:02:15,922
How can I not know,

34
00:02:15,922 --> 00:02:17,221
seeing this in front of me?

35
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:18,525
Ha...

36
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:19,661
That's why they say

37
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:22,098
you can't hide sneezes and love.

38
00:02:22,098 --> 00:02:23,172
I hope you like me, sister-in-law.

39
00:02:23,172 --> 00:02:25,887
It's our second day.

40
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,195
Where are you going?

41
00:02:39,195 --> 00:02:40,181
Are you

42
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:42,809
against our relationship?

43
00:02:45,312 --> 00:02:47,024
It's true.

44
00:02:47,024 --> 00:02:49,757
It's impossible to hide it.

45
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,700
Do you have everything?

46
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,640
I'm not a kid.

47
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,277
Of course I do.

48
00:02:55,277 --> 00:02:56,888
Hey!

49
00:02:57,604 --> 00:02:59,074
This was left over, too.

50
00:02:59,074 --> 00:03:00,952
What should I do with these leftovers?

51
00:03:00,952 --> 00:03:04,006
I can't leave them here.

52
00:03:04,006 --> 00:03:05,532
Who wants to take the meat?

53
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:06,452
Me!

54
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,302
I want it.

55
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,215
Then...

56
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:12,740
What about the kimchi and spices?

57
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,185
I'll take those, too!

58
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:17,686
Do you...

59
00:03:17,686 --> 00:03:19,285
also want the instant noodles?

60
00:03:19,285 --> 00:03:19,835
Call!

61
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,700
All mine.

62
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,196
Why do you get to take everything?

63
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,535
What do you mean?

64
00:03:29,535 --> 00:03:31,980
You are always like this.

65
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,200
What's with your tone?

66
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,300
You can take it if you want.

67
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,376
You take it.

68
00:03:38,376 --> 00:03:41,528
You always say you'll take everything.

69
00:03:41,528 --> 00:03:43,590
That really bothers me.

70
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,645
What?

71
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,400
"Bother"?

72
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,094
Hey!

73
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,400
Come on, guys.

74
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,090
Jina is living alone. That's why.

75
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,446
Do you want anything?

76
00:03:53,446 --> 00:03:55,823
Or should we split them all up?

77
00:03:55,823 --> 00:03:57,615
You think if you gave them to me now,

78
00:03:57,615 --> 00:04:00,315
I'd just take them and say "thank you"?

79
00:04:00,315 --> 00:04:02,220
Stop it.

80
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,795
What's the matter with you?

81
00:04:05,795 --> 00:04:07,451
Please.

82
00:04:12,331 --> 00:04:13,015
Oh.

83
00:04:13,015 --> 00:04:15,064
Hanna!

84
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,826
I know now.

85
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,580
You like Seungmin.

86
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,360
So what?

87
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,140
Ha...

88
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,767
Then you shouldn't show your temper like this.

89
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,900
Wait for the right time.

90
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,340
I'm going to do that, too.

91
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,520
You're early.

92
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,940
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,700
I won't be greedy next time and ask you first.

94
00:05:23,713 --> 00:05:25,280
Okay?

95
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,940
Hanna.

96
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,060
I have an announcement. Can everyone gather up?

97
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:49,775
Okay.

98
00:05:49,775 --> 00:05:53,001
You understand the agency's situation now, right?

99
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:54,645
So...

100
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,000
we must...

101
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,875
take some investment money from you, too.

102
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:06,805
Are you asking for money from us?

103
00:06:06,805 --> 00:06:09,375
How can you make it sound so cold?

104
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,025
It's an investment!

105
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:14,243
The contract didn't say such a thing.

106
00:06:15,562 --> 00:06:17,960
You don't care about the agency?

107
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,980
Do you know how much we spent to train you?

108
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,480
But we'll make profits for you later.

109
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,450
Yes.

110
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,631
Well said.

111
00:06:25,631 --> 00:06:28,424
You will make profits for us, so I'm not worried.

112
00:06:28,424 --> 00:06:29,260
So,

113
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,540
I wasn't planning to take anything from you.

114
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,090
The problem is

115
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,780
those who...

116
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,180
never get better no matter how much we train them.

117
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,340
Seung Hanna?

118
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,499
Yes.

119
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:45,012
For now,

120
00:06:45,012 --> 00:06:47,136
about 10 million won ($10,000)?

121
00:06:47,136 --> 00:06:49,653
Wire that to the CEO's account.

122
00:06:52,175 --> 00:06:54,820
Compared to the money we've invested in you up to this point,

123
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,580
it's really nothing.

124
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,413
You know that, right?

125
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:01,868
Yes.

126
00:07:04,105 --> 00:07:04,924
Manager.

127
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,054
This doesn't seem right.

128
00:07:06,054 --> 00:07:07,479
If you want to take the money, you should take it equally...

129
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:09,200
Jina!

130
00:07:10,153 --> 00:07:12,504
Adult business affairs

131
00:07:12,504 --> 00:07:15,910
all have reasons behind them.

132
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,410
Okay?

133
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,930
You know how hard Hanna worked all this time.

134
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,480
She's been practicing for years now,

135
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,176
so how could you ask for money?

136
00:07:24,176 --> 00:07:26,416
You are crossing the line.

137
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,058
Because we keep complimenting you,

138
00:07:28,058 --> 00:07:29,468
you don't know your position now?

139
00:07:29,468 --> 00:07:31,717
Why don't you open your eyes and look around instead?

140
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:35,100
What kind of agency asks for money?

141
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:39,236
Let's go.

142
00:07:39,236 --> 00:07:41,655
You don't deserve this.

143
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:47,869
Let's go!

144
00:07:49,612 --> 00:07:51,398
Leave me alone.

145
00:07:53,313 --> 00:07:54,923
What?

146
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:57,360
I'll tell my mom.

147
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,405
10 million won.

148
00:07:58,405 --> 00:08:00,390
Hey, Seong Hanna!

149
00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:03,948
You are really not going to leave?

150
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:08,135
You go alone if you want to go.

151
00:08:19,896 --> 00:08:22,233
Hey, Oh Jina!

152
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:44,359
It's the first time Hanna has been so cold to me.

153
00:08:45,237 --> 00:08:46,037
You can do this.

154
00:08:46,037 --> 00:08:47,354
No.

155
00:08:47,354 --> 00:08:50,070
1, 2, 3!

156
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,880
I believed our friendship

157
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,163
was stronger than anything, given the amount of time we had spent.

158
00:08:56,163 --> 00:08:58,028
- You're doing well!
- Really?

159
00:08:58,721 --> 00:09:00,527
Between us,

160
00:09:00,527 --> 00:09:04,063
small cracks have begun to appear.

161
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,873
And in that moment, I thought of one person.

162
00:09:31,134 --> 00:09:32,804
Lee Seungmin.

163
00:09:32,804 --> 00:09:34,034
Why are you...

164
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:36,006
What about practice?

165
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,893
Article 8.

166
00:09:38,893 --> 00:09:41,361
"Talk about our problems."

167
00:09:42,203 --> 00:09:43,496
I'm...

168
00:09:43,496 --> 00:09:45,367
here to do that.

169
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,700
You didn't do anything wrong.

170
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,255
What if I made a mistake and I'm not aware?

171
00:09:54,255 --> 00:09:55,460
Jina,

172
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,617
you are straightforward,

173
00:09:57,617 --> 00:10:00,567
but you don't hurt others with your words.

174
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,820
You don't like to be a burden.

175
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,340
So I don't think you did any harm to others.

176
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,180
You are a much better person from up close

177
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,140
than you appear from far away.

178
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,740
So don't be too hard on yourself.

179
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,660
Okay.

180
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,360
Thanks.

181
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,716
But are you okay?

182
00:10:23,716 --> 00:10:25,757
After walking away from the agency like that?

183
00:10:25,757 --> 00:10:26,807
I'm fine.

184
00:10:26,807 --> 00:10:29,300
I don't need an agency that would do that.

185
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,080
Honestly, I'm just pretending to be strong.

186
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,410
The aftermath will come tomorrow morning.

187
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,753
Debuting was my goal for the past four years.

188
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,020
What should I do now?

189
00:10:56,505 --> 00:10:58,381
Oh, turn it off!

190
00:10:58,381 --> 00:10:59,199
Why?

191
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,399
Are you shy? You? Jina?

192
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,350
Because I shine too brightly.

193
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,785
I'm pretty, and I sing well.

194
00:11:05,785 --> 00:11:07,922
Isn't it unfair?

195
00:11:09,178 --> 00:11:11,366
You seem to feel better now.

196
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:13,456
That's well recorded, by the way.

197
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:14,591
Right?

198
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,923
If I upload this on YouTube,

199
00:11:15,923 --> 00:11:17,223
don't you think it'll be a huge hit?

200
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:20,110
I don't know.

201
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,385
You don't need to debut through an agency like that.

202
00:11:22,385 --> 00:11:25,460
There are other ways to get there.

203
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,300
You are already enough of a singer now.

204
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,290
It's all going to be fine.

205
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,780
I promise you.

206
00:11:47,395 --> 00:11:50,880

Answer the phone on time.

208
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,273
Do you think I'm not busy?

209
00:12:01,273 --> 00:12:03,170
Bring back Jina.

210
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,845
Hyungtak hit three home runs.

211
00:12:04,845 --> 00:12:05,595
Really?

212
00:12:05,595 --> 00:12:07,130
From that girl.
[Q. Is there anyone you want to get support from?]

213
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,988
Will you, Jina?
[Ku Hyungtak, Hwayang High]

214
00:12:08,988 --> 00:12:10,474
Don't be too relaxed.

215
00:12:10,474 --> 00:12:12,849
The game is not over yet.
