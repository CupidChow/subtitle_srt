00:00:10,627 --> 00:00:11,372
[Jung Jisung: Jisung doesn't get it]

2
00:00:11,372 --> 00:00:12,387
[Jung Soojin: She looks like she'd do that]

3
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:13,426
[Kim Jiyoon: Seungmin was a complete pushover]

4
00:00:13,426 --> 00:00:15,319
[Gwon Jongmin: Hwayang High is crazy]

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,900
This isn't a big deal.

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,580
It's true.

7
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,705
The contract relationship.

8
00:00:27,698 --> 00:00:29,556
So, all this time, you've been pretending to date and

9
00:00:29,556 --> 00:00:30,386
were deceiving everyone?

10
00:00:30,386 --> 00:00:31,882
We didn't deceive anyone.

11
00:00:31,882 --> 00:00:33,730
It was a contract, but we did date.

12
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,301
Why did you sign a contract like that?

13
00:00:39,714 --> 00:00:41,129
Seungmin!

14
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:41,779
Hold on.

15
00:00:41,779 --> 00:00:44,579
Let me go. I should check on Jina.

16
00:00:45,556 --> 00:00:47,628
It' was me.

17
00:00:48,493 --> 00:00:49,883
I took

18
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,663
the relationship contract out of your bag.

19
00:00:51,663 --> 00:00:52,422
What?

20
00:00:52,422 --> 00:00:54,142
I mean...

21
00:00:54,142 --> 00:00:55,257
Yesterday,

22
00:00:55,257 --> 00:00:57,084
I was looking for the portable battery in the club room and

23
00:00:57,084 --> 00:00:59,520
went through your bag.

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,400
So I took that out and read it.

25
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,165
I think that's how it got leaked.

26
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,015
I'm sorry!

27
00:01:06,015 --> 00:01:08,499
You can beat me up as much as you want.

28
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:16,091
Get up for now.

29
00:01:16,889 --> 00:01:19,324
I'm going to talk to Jina.

30
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,950
[Sigh...]

31
00:01:25,728 --> 00:01:27,460
Are you okay?

32
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,520
Of course I'm okay.

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,915
You thought I'd be shocked by something like this and lose confidence?

34
00:01:33,915 --> 00:01:38,100
I guess it's just made me realize it's not fun to receive this kind of attention.

35
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:38,995
Yes, well...

36
00:01:38,995 --> 00:01:41,153
Things like this can happen.

37
00:01:41,153 --> 00:01:43,565
Don't get hurt.

38
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,385
But...

39
00:01:46,385 --> 00:01:48,671
who do you think did this?

40
00:01:48,671 --> 00:01:49,920
Mine is at home.

41
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,976
I think Seungmin's is the one that got leaked.

42
00:01:51,976 --> 00:01:54,968
What does he say?

43
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,440
I don't know.

44
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,840
He's not answering.

45
00:02:10,745 --> 00:02:12,620
Are you looking for Jina?

46
00:02:14,905 --> 00:02:16,725
You know what's going on, right?

47
00:02:16,725 --> 00:02:18,500
Yes.

48
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,397
That's why I'm going to Jina...

49
00:02:19,397 --> 00:02:22,536
I heard you're the one that lost the contract.

50
00:02:22,536 --> 00:02:24,846
Jina is super mad.

51
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:27,671
She doesn't want to see you.

52
00:02:27,671 --> 00:02:29,705
Really?

53
00:02:29,705 --> 00:02:31,066
Yes.

54
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:33,042
She says she doesn't want to hear from you now.

55
00:02:33,042 --> 00:02:36,302
At all.

56
00:02:36,302 --> 00:02:37,780
But...

57
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,695
when did you make up with her?

58
00:02:40,695 --> 00:02:42,396
Huh?

59
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:46,274
We never fought.

60
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:55,740
Is she that mad?

61
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,590
Oh my gosh.

62
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,440
There's another update.

63
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,365
Wow!

64
00:02:58,365 --> 00:02:59,440
What does it say?

65
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,490
Let me read this.

66
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,668
"It's ridiculous that Oh Jina is so proudly holding her head up right now."

67
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:08,728
"So let me tell you why this contract relationship is so disgusting, haha."

68
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:10,221
"The point is"

69
00:03:10,221 --> 00:03:11,290
"that Oh Jina was power-tripping."

70
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,465
I don't think I can do this.

71
00:03:12,465 --> 00:03:15,070
- "Lee Seungmin rejected her offer for a contract relationship."
- What?

72
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:15,806
What are you doing, Lee Seungmin?

73
00:03:15,806 --> 00:03:17,816
- Come out, quickly.
- "He's going out with her only because she threatened him."

74
00:03:17,816 --> 00:03:20,584
"She would call him out whenever she needed him"

75
00:03:20,584 --> 00:03:22,549
"and forced him to kiss her"

76
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:24,828
"because she wanted to get away from Koo Hyungtak."

77
00:03:24,828 --> 00:03:27,420
"If this is true, it's not a dating contract. Isn't this literally a slave contract?"

78
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,095
"Can she do this just because she's popular?"

79
00:03:35,264 --> 00:03:36,529
Jina.

80
00:03:36,529 --> 00:03:38,633
Look at this.

81
00:03:44,876 --> 00:03:47,635
- The act is so creepy.
- She could do that to us, too.

82
00:03:47,635 --> 00:03:50,353
What do you mean forcing a kiss?
- What's wrong with her?

83
00:03:50,353 --> 00:03:53,608
She's so fake and pretentious.

84
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,628
Jina's school life is so over now.

85
00:03:55,628 --> 00:03:58,677
Maybe this is why Hyungtak dumped her.

86
00:04:01,603 --> 00:04:03,946
This is crazy!

87
00:04:11,368 --> 00:04:12,688
What's all this?

88
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:15,611
Who's doing this?

89
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:16,618
- Hey, come here.
- Why?

90
00:04:16,618 --> 00:04:17,761
It's a relationship contract.

91
00:04:17,761 --> 00:04:18,711
"Oh Jina, Lee Seungmin."

92
00:04:18,711 --> 00:04:19,623
Wow.

93
00:04:19,623 --> 00:04:21,605
Wow, seriously.

94
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,940
Is this all true?

95
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,970
Yes.

96
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,200
I got goosebumps because it was so accurate.

97
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,460
What? This is crazy.

98
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,235
She's completely mental.

99
00:04:35,235 --> 00:04:37,175
See? I told you I was right.

100
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:41,147
Can you really say something like that now?

101
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,171
Hanna,

102
00:04:42,171 --> 00:04:44,461
did you see this?

103
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,440
I think that messenger only told the truth.

104
00:04:56,385 --> 00:04:57,973
Wow.

105
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,209
Are you nervous?

106
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:07,694
About what?

107
00:05:07,694 --> 00:05:09,991
This is the final.

108
00:05:09,991 --> 00:05:14,220
Our victory depends on you. Aren't you nervous?

109
00:05:26,675 --> 00:05:28,298
What is this?

110
00:05:28,298 --> 00:05:29,767
Why?

111
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:31,791
Did something happen?

112
00:05:37,735 --> 00:05:39,566
Ha...

113
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:42,032
I didn't want a gift like this.

114
00:05:42,032 --> 00:05:44,869
I just wanted you to be by my side.

115
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,054
Where are you going?

116
00:05:53,054 --> 00:05:55,203
We have to leave now!

117
00:05:55,203 --> 00:05:57,296
We have to bring him back.

118
00:05:57,296 --> 00:06:00,097
He must have something he wants more than the victory.

119
00:06:00,097 --> 00:06:01,929
Let him go.

120
00:06:06,195 --> 00:06:08,985
Where is he? Why is he not answering!

121
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,860
Did you see Seungmin?

122
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,700
No.

123
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,938
He's gone missing.

124
00:06:15,938 --> 00:06:16,898
Oh!

125
00:06:16,898 --> 00:06:19,088
Where is he?

126

[Exciting]

127
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,160
I think this photo was taken here.

128
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,187
Right, I think that's the same letter.

129
00:06:58,187 --> 00:07:01,506
What? The background is the same.

130
00:07:12,484 --> 00:07:15,383
Jina, where are you going?

131
00:07:18,491 --> 00:07:21,525
Be quiet! I can't hear them.

132
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,960
I'm asking just in case.

133
00:07:27,644 --> 00:07:29,580
Is this...

134
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,720
you?

135
00:07:36,603 --> 00:07:38,563
Why?

136
00:07:40,942 --> 00:07:44,462
I wanted you to lose everything.

137
00:07:45,835 --> 00:07:47,396
What?

138
00:07:47,396 --> 00:07:49,517
You are nothing,

139
00:07:49,517 --> 00:07:53,332
but you have everything. And that bothers me.

140
00:07:54,756 --> 00:07:57,314
Are you the Hanna that I know?

141
00:07:57,314 --> 00:08:00,004
Why are you doing this to me all of a sudden?

142
00:08:00,004 --> 00:08:02,400
"All of a sudden"?

143
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,771
I've always hated you.

144
00:08:05,771 --> 00:08:09,149
Since the day you came into the agency all green.

145
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:12,669
You were a pain in the neck to me since then.

146

[Four Years Ago]

147
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,439
Her name is Oh Jina.

148
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:26,415
She was chosen out of 300 applicants.

149
00:08:26,415 --> 00:08:28,313
The rising star of WHY Ent.

150
00:08:28,313 --> 00:08:31,279
That is to say she's completely different from you,

151
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,820
who entered the agency when we were just accepting anyone.

152
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,509
Say hi.

153
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:38,754
Hi. Pleased to meet you.

154
00:08:38,754 --> 00:08:43,175
It was annoying enough that you got all the attention from the agency.

155
00:08:43,175 --> 00:08:47,010
[Two Years Ago]

156
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,465
Hanna.

157
00:08:48,465 --> 00:08:51,060
Is this part hard for you?

158
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,435
I'll show you.

159
00:08:52,435 --> 00:08:54,239
Don't swing in the front.

160
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:56,331
Swing in the back.

161
00:08:56,331 --> 00:08:59,025
Tap, tap.

162
00:08:59,025 --> 00:09:00,679
But your expression matters, too.

163
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:03,130
- It's like...
- You kept on progressing ahead of me.

164
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:06,205
I hated that.

165
00:09:07,137 --> 00:09:10,327
Didn't you notice? Never?

166
00:09:11,277 --> 00:09:14,882
I could stand all that, though.

167
00:09:14,882 --> 00:09:17,280
But you know what?

168
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,160
Because you quit the agency,

169
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,620
even my debut could be cancelled now.

170
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,070
I didn't know that.

171
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,316
Ha...

00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:30,141
Isn't that ridiculous?

173
00:09:30,141 --> 00:09:32,576
What's even more ridiculous is that

174
00:09:32,576 --> 00:09:36,443
you messed up everything, but you're not receiving any punishment for that.

175

Instead, you're becoming popular on YouTube.

176
00:09:39,728 --> 00:09:42,558
I'm the one who tried so hard and put in so much effort all these years.

177
00:09:42,558 --> 00:09:44,193
Don't you think I should have that?

178
00:09:44,193 --> 00:09:45,633
No, stick to the facts.

179
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:48,148
Do you think I got those things with no effort?

180
00:09:48,148 --> 00:09:51,617
I worked so hard because I wanted to be as good as you.

181
00:09:51,617 --> 00:09:53,730
And, still, I liked it

182
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,595
because I thought we could achieve our dreams together.

183
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,025
You liked it because you always beat me!

184
00:10:00,147 --> 00:10:03,823
I never got to beat you. I was always the loser.

185
00:10:03,823 --> 00:10:06,512
Do you even know how that feels?

for what?

I'm not trying to get anything.

189
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,040
If I can't get it anyway,

190
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,100
then I'd rather take away yours, too.

191
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,065
How can you...

192
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,145
do this to me?

193
00:10:36,941 --> 00:10:39,921
Now the others won't like you anymore.

194
00:10:39,921 --> 00:10:43,770
Once gossip starts, it doesn't go away easily.

First of all,

She did call me whenever she needed me,
