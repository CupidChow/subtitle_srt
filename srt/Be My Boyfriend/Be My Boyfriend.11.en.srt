Of course he does.

Why does everyone only care about her?

171
00:08:43,768 --> 00:08:46,150
If you have the least bit of a conscience,

172
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,868
let me have at least one thing.

173
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,725
Your contract is over soon, right?

174
00:08:58,725 --> 00:08:59,705
Oh.

175
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,274
Is it already time for that?

176
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,699
Why did you ask?

177
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:05,100
If you're done with her,

178
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,224
start with me.

179
00:09:06,224 --> 00:09:07,726
Date me.

180
00:09:07,726 --> 00:09:08,806
Oh...

181
00:09:08,806 --> 00:09:10,096
Don't joke.

182
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:12,311
No, I'm serious.

183
00:09:12,311 --> 00:09:15,259
I've liked you for a long time now.

184
00:09:17,437 --> 00:09:19,040
If you don't like me yet,

185
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,160
then let's start with a contract, too.

186
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,985
Then you might fall in love with me.

187
00:09:26,138 --> 00:09:28,600
I'd be nicer to you

188
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,220
than Oh Jina.

189
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,155
I'm sorry.

190
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,990
I really like Jina.

191
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,210
And I don't think this will change after the contract is over.

192
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:50,165
Why isn't it me?

193
00:09:51,285 --> 00:09:52,135
That's...

194
00:09:52,135 --> 00:09:54,316
I've tried and tried

195
00:09:54,316 --> 00:09:56,826
to be as good as her.

196
00:09:56,826 --> 00:09:58,776
Why do you like her more?

197
00:09:58,776 --> 00:10:01,561
Why does everyone like her more?

198
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,420
Hey!

199
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,315
What are you doing here?

200
00:10:10,315 --> 00:10:11,790
You two?

201
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,320
Can't you see that we're talking?

202
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,360
Who are you most interested in?

203
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,310
Then go ahead.

204
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,370
Right now.

205
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,125
Can you go and wait in the classroom?

206
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,500
I'll catch up with you.

207
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,691
What do you two have to talk about without me?

208
00:10:32,538 --> 00:10:33,673
Wow.

209
00:10:33,673 --> 00:10:35,606
Let's go.

210
00:10:38,465 --> 00:10:40,385
He's my boyfriend.

211
00:10:40,385 --> 00:10:42,320
Don't mess with him.

212
00:10:52,471 --> 00:10:55,370
[The next day]

213
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,003
Does that make any sense at all?

214
00:10:57,003 --> 00:10:59,339
Wow, really?

215
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,405
What the—

216
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,920
Hey...

217
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:23,589
Jina!

218
00:11:41,163 --> 00:11:42,047
[Oh Jina's deceit: Announcement. Jina fooled the entire school. Relationship Contract: Including all contents of the contract.]

221

[Kim Haein: I knew it]

222
00:11:56,874 --> 00:11:57,675
It's me.
[Next Episode]

223
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,540
The person who took out the contract

224
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,924
from your backpack.

225
00:11:59,924 --> 00:12:01,306
Who did this?

226
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:03,862
Mine is at home, so I think someone got a hold of Seungmin's.

227
00:12:03,862 --> 00:12:06,192
You said you lost the contract,

228
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,896
so Jina is really upset with you.

229
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:09,488
What's this?

230
00:12:09,488 --> 00:12:11,540
Hyungtak, where are you going?

231
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:14,260
Jina, where are you going?

232
