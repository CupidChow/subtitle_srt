1
00:00:02,991 --> 00:00:05,444
This... this is...

2
00:00:05,444 --> 00:00:07,094
your place?

3
00:00:07,094 --> 00:00:09,824
Yes! It's under my name.

4
00:00:09,824 --> 00:00:11,801
Minji...

5
00:00:11,801 --> 00:00:13,480
Just how rich are you?

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,480
However much you can imagine,

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,776
it's probably beyond that.

8
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:19,456
That's so totally awesome.

9
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:22,010
Let's be much closer friends from now on.

10
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,771
No, thanks.

11
00:00:24,528 --> 00:00:26,666
Hey, let's go in.

12
00:00:33,605 --> 00:00:35,592
Put on your cone hats!

13
00:00:35,592 --> 00:00:37,208
Do we need to do this?

14
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,308
Look at Hanna.

15
00:00:41,195 --> 00:00:42,107
Hurry and put them on.

16
00:00:42,107 --> 00:00:44,025
I'm ready.

17
00:00:44,973 --> 00:00:46,510
Two people!

18
00:00:57,456 --> 00:00:59,423
Huh... Huh?

19
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,205
Oh... Oh!

20
00:01:03,205 --> 00:01:05,238
The end.

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,115
Do it again! Let's do a do-over.

22
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,173
Get your legs up.

23
00:01:16,173 --> 00:01:17,647
Ready and go!

24
00:01:17,647 --> 00:01:20,172
- I'm going to win.
- Take care of her.

25
00:01:20,172 --> 00:01:21,291
Ah!

26
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,273
Why, you...

27
00:01:30,688 --> 00:01:32,261
Hey, Oh Bawool!

28
00:01:32,261 --> 00:01:33,953
- I won.
- Hey, Bawool.

29
00:01:33,953 --> 00:01:36,774
- Oh Bawool, let's do it again.
- Bawool.

30
00:01:36,774 --> 00:01:39,336
This will take three weeks to heal!

31
00:01:47,905 --> 00:01:49,135
What is that you've been holding all this time?

32
00:01:49,135 --> 00:01:50,566
I rented it from the broadcasting studio.

33
00:01:50,566 --> 00:01:52,697
I wanted to record it since it's our first trip together.

34
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:53,967
Oh.

35
00:01:56,395 --> 00:01:58,155
Shoot me, too.

36
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,419
Hey, what did you say, Bawool?

37
00:02:03,419 --> 00:02:04,619
I didn't say anything.

38
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,234
What's this?

39
00:02:06,234 --> 00:02:07,624
Hurry and let me see.

40
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:09,091
He's rather cute.

41
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:12,383
Not rather, but totally.

42
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:14,880
By the way, aren't you busy? Don't you have practices?

43
00:02:14,899 --> 00:02:17,227
The entire baseball team is on a break.

44
00:02:17,227 --> 00:02:18,437
We get back to work the day after tomorrow.

45
00:02:18,437 --> 00:02:20,572
Take some rest when you're on a break.

46
00:02:20,643 --> 00:02:22,641
Geez. Look at that sweat.

47
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,160
Now that I'm sweating and everything,

48
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,318
are you worried about me?

49
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,475
What are you doing?

50
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:50,163
Getting ready to cook kimchi stew.

51
00:02:50,163 --> 00:02:52,253
Is there anything I can help with?

52
00:02:52,253 --> 00:02:55,197
Um... Could you chop some green onions?

53
00:03:01,155 --> 00:03:02,731
Is this size alright?

54
00:03:02,731 --> 00:03:03,931
Yes. Um...

55
00:03:03,931 --> 00:03:05,806
A bit smaller than that.

56
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:09,078
This much?

57
00:03:09,078 --> 00:03:11,498
Yes! That's just right.

58
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,830
Ah! Just a little of that.

59
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,306
You think it'll be too spicy?

60
00:03:18,306 --> 00:03:20,268
Yes. I think it might.

61
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,775
What are you doing?

62
00:03:22,775 --> 00:03:25,214
Is there anything you need?

63
00:03:25,214 --> 00:03:26,509
Is it going well?

64
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:28,210
Just about?

65
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,887
Let me get a taste.

66
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,345
Hm? It's a bit bland.

67
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:37,617
Kimchi stew needs to be spicy and have a kick.

68
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:40,249
- Let's put in more ground red pepper.
- Okay.

69
00:03:44,765 --> 00:03:46,755
Good.

70
00:03:48,715 --> 00:03:51,736
Wow, it looks amazing.

71
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,905
Wow.

72
00:03:55,905 --> 00:03:57,071
It totally has a kick to it.

73
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,237
It fits right to my taste.

74
00:03:58,237 --> 00:03:59,953
It's insane. Insane. Wow.

75
00:03:59,953 --> 00:04:01,739
Would you like me to get you some stew?

76
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:04,099
It's okay. I'm not a child or anything.

77
00:04:08,305 --> 00:04:09,960
Please get me some.

78
00:04:14,483 --> 00:04:16,186
What's this?

79
00:04:16,186 --> 00:04:19,073
Why do you ask someone else's boyfriend to help you?

80
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,000
I'll get you some.

81
00:04:23,665 --> 00:04:28,032
The stew I get you will probably taste just a bit better.

82
00:04:29,426 --> 00:04:30,656
Here.

83
00:04:42,062 --> 00:04:44,097
Hanna, this tastes good.

84
00:04:46,008 --> 00:04:48,025
Well, it's not like I made it.

85
00:04:53,068 --> 00:04:54,908
Everyone knows what a whisper game is, right?

86
00:04:54,908 --> 00:04:58,457
A person next to you asks a question in a whisper, and you point to the person of the answer.

87
00:04:58,457 --> 00:05:01,475
If you're curious, get your back hit.
If not, we pass the turn along.

88
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:02,957
Then, I'll start the game!

89
00:05:02,957 --> 00:05:04,572
Okay!

90
00:05:10,205 --> 00:05:13,555
Someone you want to go on a date with, just the two of you.

91
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,885
Me?

92
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:23,715
Me?

93
00:05:23,715 --> 00:05:26,163
Oh, my gosh! What is this, Oh Bawool?

94
00:05:26,163 --> 00:05:27,883
For real.

95
00:05:27,883 --> 00:05:32,052
Are you guys playing a game or flirting?

96
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,507
Whoo!

97
00:05:33,507 --> 00:05:35,243
We'll play on.

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,220
Him.

99
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,549
Oh.

100
00:05:50,549 --> 00:05:52,814
What is it? What is it?

101
00:05:52,814 --> 00:05:55,409
Oh... What could it be? I'm so curious.

102
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:58,168
If you're curious, get your back hit.

103
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,940
I'll let it slide.

104
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:05,965
I want to hear it.

105
00:06:07,376 --> 00:06:10,598
"Indian Bop!"

106
00:06:12,825 --> 00:06:15,090
What I asked Jina was

107
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,100
if there's anyone

108
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,982
who seems like the type to sneak in the kitchen in the middle of the night to eat snacks.

109
00:06:23,515 --> 00:06:24,265
Him.

110
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:25,206
I want to hear it.

111
00:06:25,206 --> 00:06:25,956
Him.

112
00:06:25,956 --> 00:06:27,276
Me. Me. I'm going to hear the question.

113
00:06:27,276 --> 00:06:29,801
Him. Him! Him!

114
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:32,471
"Indian Bop!"

115
00:06:32,471 --> 00:06:34,796
Me. Me. Me! I'll hear it.

116
00:06:34,796 --> 00:06:37,258
"Indian Bop!"

117
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,493
Now... It's the last question, right?

118
00:06:43,493 --> 00:06:45,110
I'll go.

119
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,826
Oh.

120
00:07:02,826 --> 00:07:04,761
What's this? What's this?

121
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:06,411
Me!

122
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:08,230
I want to hear it.

123
00:07:10,615 --> 00:07:13,591
"Indian Bop!"

124
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,555
What I asked Seong Hanna is

125
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:29,765
"Who here are you most interested in?"

126
00:07:29,765 --> 00:07:31,438
That was it.

127
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,730
Well, it would've been awkward for her to pick Bawool.

128
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,727
And it could never be Ku Hyungtak.

129
00:07:51,727 --> 00:07:52,577
Right.

130
00:07:52,577 --> 00:07:55,439
She had no one else to pick but Seungmin.

131
00:07:56,411 --> 00:07:59,053
Right. It must be nothing.

132
00:08:21,858 --> 00:08:23,290
Ah, shoot!

133
00:08:30,705 --> 00:08:32,265
What is it?

134
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:59,135
[To Lee Seungmin] I have a bit of a stomachache from eating all that spicy food.

135
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,960
Could you go to the pharmacy with me?

136
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,208
You could've just messaged me. Why the window?

137
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,959
My phone's battery is dead.

138
00:09:20,015 --> 00:09:21,927
You could just charge it.

139
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:24,167
Did you not bring a charger? Should I lend you mine?

140
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:27,362
I didn't want to wait until it charged up.

141
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,330
What's that?

142
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,507
I wanted to shoot if I saw something pretty.

143
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,754
Is there anything you can see in this dark night?

144
00:09:38,455 --> 00:09:39,512
Oh, that's right.

145
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,317
Are you alright from getting hit on the back earlier?

146
00:09:41,317 --> 00:09:42,940
Yes, I'm alright.

147
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,211
Other than feeling as if my shoulder bone is broken.

148
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:49,389
Were you that curious about why I was picked?

149
00:09:50,877 --> 00:09:51,664
No.

150
00:09:51,664 --> 00:09:54,756
I just did that simply because I was curious.

151
00:09:54,756 --> 00:09:57,262
I'm not a loser who gets jealous or anything.

152
00:09:57,262 --> 00:09:59,217
Don't you get me wrong.

153
00:09:59,217 --> 00:10:00,993
Did I say anything?

154
00:10:00,993 --> 00:10:03,726
By the way, what did Hanna pick me for?

155
00:10:05,915 --> 00:10:07,504
How can I tell you that?

156
00:10:07,504 --> 00:10:09,514
It's a secret.

157
00:10:12,605 --> 00:10:14,413
Wait up.

158
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:23,080
♫ The warm breeze comes to me ♫

159
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:30,650
♫ I can feel everything, though I can't see it ♫

160
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:39,080
♫ You entered my mind like this somehow ♫

161
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:47,810
♫ When I see the wind, it's okay because it's you ♫

162
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,980
It's really incredible.

163
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,890
What is?

164
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:07,865
When I first saw you sing,

165
00:11:07,865 --> 00:11:10,570
you seemed like a being so far away.

166
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,715
Now,

167
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,810
you're next to me.

168
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:24,844
This feels like the perfect timing to kiss.

169
00:11:25,404 --> 00:11:28,019
Then, shall we?

170
