00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:12,992
You surprised me.

3
00:00:12,992 --> 00:00:15,097
Let's play hooky today.

4
00:00:15,097 --> 00:00:17,072
Hooky?

5
00:00:17,072 --> 00:00:18,625
No, I can't.

6
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:19,710
Come on.

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,447
No.

8
00:00:21,447 --> 00:00:22,847
Come on.

9
00:00:22,847 --> 00:00:25,082
I can't do that.

10
00:00:25,082 --> 00:00:28,316
Oh... I shouldn't do this.

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,450
By the way, where are we going?

12
00:00:41,627 --> 00:00:43,372
Well...

13
00:00:43,372 --> 00:00:46,109
is there anything we've never done before as a couple?

14
00:00:53,615 --> 00:00:56,265
- No.
- Give me that!

15
00:00:58,709 --> 00:00:59,868
You need to eat them one by one.

16
00:00:59,868 --> 00:01:00,733
Give me that!

17
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:02,696
- No.
- Hey!

18
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:03,246
I won't.

19
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:05,556
- Give me that. Hurry up.
- I won't.

20
00:01:21,885 --> 00:01:23,147
What's this?

21
00:01:23,147 --> 00:01:24,906
What? It came out very well.

22
00:01:24,906 --> 00:01:27,276
Take a better one!

♫ Look at me  ♫

25
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:52,440
♫ I want to stay by your side. I want to tell you  ♫

What's wrong? Are you sick?

28
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,195
What's wrong?

29
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:08,755
When I see you...

30
00:02:08,755 --> 00:02:10,227
my... breath...

31
00:02:10,227 --> 00:02:10,927
Breath?

32
00:02:10,927 --> 00:02:12,023
Breath!

33
00:02:12,023 --> 00:02:13,003
Breath?

34
00:02:13,003 --> 00:02:15,523
I'm made breathless by your beauty.

35
00:02:18,152 --> 00:02:20,011
Oh, silly.

36
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:23,920
I told you to have your inhaler when you're with me!

37
00:02:24,634 --> 00:02:26,163
This is the only way.

38
00:02:26,163 --> 00:02:28,505
I should do mouth-to-mouth on you.

39
00:02:28,505 --> 00:02:29,930
Mouth-to-mouth?

40
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,546
My girlfriend is so amazing.

41
00:02:31,546 --> 00:02:34,404
Do it right now! Now!

42
00:02:44,452 --> 00:02:46,810
What's wrong?

43
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,560
As if you saw a ghost.

44
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,915
Why are you lying there?

45
00:02:55,035 --> 00:02:57,828
I was about to get mouth-to-mouth.

46
00:02:57,828 --> 00:02:59,778
Hanna, are you okay?

47
00:02:59,778 --> 00:03:01,433
Is everything okay?

48
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:02,532
Yes.

49
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:04,998
I haven't seen Jina today.

50
00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:08,033
I don't know. I couldn't reach her today.

51
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:10,947
What about Seungmin? Did you see him today?

52
00:03:10,947 --> 00:03:14,767
No. He said he had something to do.

53
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:18,305
I guess they're together.

[Message from Hanna]

"Tiger Sister"?

56
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,470
Do you read this kind of book?

57
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,760
Of course. This is my all time favorite.

58
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,441
"I want to eat your appendix"?

59
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:53,870
I'm not into these sentimental novels...

60
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,445
Do we have to switch our books and read?

61
00:04:02,445 --> 00:04:05,520
It's fun. We will learn about each other's preferences.

62
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,642
This kid will die on the next page.

63
00:04:16,642 --> 00:04:19,312
Hey, no spoilers.

64
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,502
In the next book, this one will betray that one.

65
00:04:26,502 --> 00:04:29,300
Oh, seriously.

66
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,030
It's fun to read each other's books.

67
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,261
But why aren't you reading this one?

68
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:36,605
I've read it all.

69
00:04:36,605 --> 00:04:38,525
Already? Don't lie.

70
00:04:38,525 --> 00:04:41,095
I did.

71
00:04:41,095 --> 00:04:43,548
What happened to the main characters?

72
00:04:43,548 --> 00:04:46,428
They break up in the end.

73
00:04:46,428 --> 00:04:48,233
Oh, you really read it!

74
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:49,953
How was it? Isn't it fun?

75
00:04:49,953 --> 00:04:51,865
No.

76
00:04:51,865 --> 00:04:53,370
I don't like such things.

77
00:05:11,775 --> 00:05:16,420
You... look better today.

78
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:21,040
Jina and Seungmin's contract relationship will be over today.

79
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,210
Will they really end it?

80
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,210
Yes. I asked Jina to end it.

81
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:30,210
Are you sure you asked? Not threatened her?

82
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,655
Anyway. Do your best to capture Jina's heart...

83
00:05:33,655 --> 00:05:37,790
so that I can have a chance with Seungmin.

84
00:05:48,046 --> 00:05:49,505
Playing hooky and having a date was a nice idea!

85
00:05:49,505 --> 00:05:51,807
Let's do this once every week.

86
00:05:51,807 --> 00:05:52,691
No.

87
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:53,871
Is that too frequent?

88
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:56,183
What about once a month?

89
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,473
What?

90
00:05:58,473 --> 00:06:00,780
Is that too frequent?

91
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,425
There will be no more.

92
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,364
Yes?

93
00:06:13,075 --> 00:06:15,895
Are you here? I'll go pick it up.

94

Hello?

00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:53,077
Oh, I'm glad you picked up. Is this Lee Seungmin?

100
00:06:53,077 --> 00:06:54,997
He's not here.

101
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,578
This is the community service center in Hwayang-dong.

102
00:06:57,578 --> 00:06:58,991
Hwayang-dong?

103
00:06:58,991 --> 00:07:00,556
Yes! This is to notify you

104
00:07:00,556 --> 00:07:04,739
that the traffic light is fixed on Hwayang-dong Street 13.

105
00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:07,221
Hwayang-dong Street 13?

106
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:08,403
That's in front of my house.

107
00:07:08,403 --> 00:07:09,699
Yeah, there!

108
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:11,584
He kept asking us to fix it.

109
00:07:11,584 --> 00:07:13,999
He called several times every day.

110
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:17,192
It gave me a headache!

111
00:07:17,192 --> 00:07:19,755
How long has that been out of order?

112
00:07:19,755 --> 00:07:21,503
It could be dangerous.

113
00:07:21,503 --> 00:07:23,482
Don't you need to call the community service center?

114
00:07:23,482 --> 00:07:24,362
To fix it.

115
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:26,431
Forget it.

Yes.

118
00:07:30,377 --> 00:07:34,066
Anyway, it's fixed now. Please be assured

119
00:07:34,066 --> 00:07:35,963
and never call us again!

120
00:07:35,963 --> 00:07:37,549
Oh, okay.

121
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,070
Do your best to capture Jina's heart...

122
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:26,146
so that I can have a chance with Seungmin.

123
00:08:27,895 --> 00:08:33,470
Well, do you like Seungmin or...

124
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,930
do you want to win against Jina?

125
00:08:38,368 --> 00:08:40,905
Both.

126
00:08:40,905 --> 00:08:44,605
Well, Seungmin is another issue.

127
00:08:44,605 --> 00:08:47,170
But why do you want to win against her so much?

128
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,245
I think you can understand it.

129

Rivalry. You know how it feels.

I don't know.

Even so, I haven't tried to win against my friend.

133

I guess Jina was the only one who thought you guys were friends.

Thanks to you, I learned that kimchi fried rice at internet cafés is delicious.

00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,760
What's going on

172
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,137
between you two?

173
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:27,042
We broke up.

174
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:28,710
I heard you broke up with Seungmin.

175
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,585
Are you okay?

176
00:13:29,585 --> 00:13:31,219
Are you here to comfort me?

177
00:13:31,219 --> 00:13:34,630
Hanna, what do you think a friend is?
