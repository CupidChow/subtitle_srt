Lunch in Seongsu-dong? Tomorrow?

17
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,035
Good.

18
00:01:23,035 --> 00:01:26,480
I bet you'll wear high heels. I don't want you to walk for long.

19
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,300
I'll pick you up there.

20
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,985
See you tomorrow.

21
00:01:33,655 --> 00:01:36,030
Are you dating someone new? Again?

22
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,875
Dad, you're quite popular.

23
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:39,616
Of course.

24
00:01:39,616 --> 00:01:43,325
I know what women like.

25
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,660
Tell me, too.

26
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,835
What do girls like?

27
00:01:49,697 --> 00:01:53,149
My son. Why are you curious about that?

28
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:55,260
Because... your son started dating.

29
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,245
Really?

30
00:01:57,245 --> 00:01:58,230
Who's the lucky girl?

31
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:02,040
- Who is she?
- Oh... Stop asking, please.

32
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,045
You've grown up.

33
00:02:05,451 --> 00:02:06,561
OK!

34
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:08,970
I'll tell you everything.

35

Oh! Seats are empty!

36
00:02:21,545 --> 00:02:24,445
You're so annoying. Get out of my way.

00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:27,545
Sit down.

38
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:29,195
Yes.

39
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:33,810
Hanna, is that all you're having?

40
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,500
I've gained some extra weight, so I'm cutting down on carbs.

41
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,860
Wow. Amazing.

42
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:48,530
Oh... should I have bought kimchi dumplings?

43
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,500
First of all,

44
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,300
if you're starting to see someone, bring her to all the must-eat restaurants.

45
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,260
Why?

46
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,355
Eating what she likes together will give you extra points.

47
00:03:05,595 --> 00:03:06,746
Are these...

48
00:03:06,746 --> 00:03:08,155
kimchi dumplings?

49
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:09,738
Yes.

50
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,190
You don't need to do this.

51
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,835
- Did I score some points?
- No.

52
00:03:16,835 --> 00:03:18,650
This is usual for me.

53
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,570
Then, I'll eat them alone.

54
00:03:24,475 --> 00:03:26,590
Thank you!

Shocking news!

62
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,800
You're over-reacting again.

63
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,820
Finally, Tik Tak club is open!

64
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,780
Real?

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,530

Why is my best friend killing the mood?

- Taking you home.
- Oh, my.

80
00:04:51,935 --> 00:04:54,753
Never mind. I'm not going home.

81
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,680
You need to be a cool guy, who's not clingy.

82
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,060
If you let her go, pretending you're not disappointed,

83
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,835
she'll come back to you.

00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,045
He played hard to get before signing.

OK.

90
00:05:25,715 --> 00:05:27,390
What was that?

91
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,760
Did you avoid me?

92
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,650
Does it look like I'm avoiding you?

93
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,940
Let's go, Seungmin.

[You & Me]

97
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,540
I guess it's necessary to know more about you.

98
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,945
Because Hyungtak suspects us.

99
00:05:57,945 --> 00:05:59,135

Yes.

Your favorite food is Mala stew?

102
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,080
We have something in common.

103
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,776
I like spicy food.

104
00:06:13,776 --> 00:06:15,105
You were born in Jeju Island?

105
00:06:15,105 --> 00:06:16,455
I thought you were from Seoul.

106
00:06:16,455 --> 00:06:18,865
Your MBTI type is INFP?

107
00:06:18,865 --> 00:06:21,350
Oh, right. You seemed so.

108
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,525
When I suggested this,

109
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:24,112
you were too hesitant.

110
00:06:24,112 --> 00:06:26,100
It's not because I'm hesitant.

111
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,040
It's because I'm thoughtful.

112
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,440
Oh!

113
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,670
It says ENTP and INFP match together well.

114
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,797
Good.

115
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:38,975
Your ideal type is "Girlfriend?"

116
00:06:38,975 --> 00:06:40,840
Do you like the K-pop band "GFRIEND?"

117
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,434
Oh, that's...

118
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:42,634
Me, too!

119
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:45,960
Their song "Me Gustas Tu" is a great song.

120
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,475
I'm not talking about them.

121
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:53,900
I need to go to the dance studio.

122
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,070
I'll read the rest at home.

123
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,840
OK. I'll go to the studio later.

124
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,380
To take you home.

125
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,820
It'll take long.

126
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,435
Will it be okay?

127
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:04,488
Yes!

128
00:07:04,488 --> 00:07:06,080

Yeah.

132
00:07:23,455 --> 00:07:26,579
I had to talk with Lee Seungmin.

133
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,065
Well,

134
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:31,335
will it be okay with him?

135
00:07:31,335 --> 00:07:32,520
About what?

136
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,320
It's a mere contractual relationship.

137
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,140
You could've chosen a better-looking, nicer guy.

138
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,985
You happened to pick him out from the bulletin board.

139
00:07:39,985 --> 00:07:42,304
Isn't it weird to date him?

140
00:07:42,304 --> 00:07:44,220
What should I do?

141
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,565
Hyungtak saw his name and face.

142
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:52,265
He's too ordinary. You deserve better than that.

143
00:07:52,265 --> 00:07:54,550
That's a compliment, right?

144
00:08:03,945 --> 00:08:06,530
Let's see how you've practiced.

145
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,400
Aren't you going?

146
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,980
I'll practice a bit more.

147
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,870
OK.

148
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,355

You really waited for me.

151
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,835
Because it's an article of our contract.

152
00:08:30,835 --> 00:08:33,300
Isn't it hard to practice as a trainee?

153
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,280
It's tough.

154
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,848
But it's doable.

155
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,080
Since when did you start doing this?

156
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,485
It wasn't in the list of 100 questions and answers.

157
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:42,430
Since I was in 8th grade...

158
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,908
So for 3 or 4 years.

159
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:50,374
Watch out!

160
00:09:01,355 --> 00:09:03,789
I was going to step back.

161
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,350
The traffic light is broken.

162
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,755
It's been so long.

163
00:09:10,755 --> 00:09:13,109
It can be dangerous.

164
00:09:13,109 --> 00:09:15,060
Why don't you call the community service center?

165
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,025
To fix it.

166
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:19,073
No need.

00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,040

Yes?

173
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,015
Give it to me first.

174
00:09:44,015 --> 00:09:45,939
Your mobile number.

175
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:48,850
Well,

176
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:52,393
just in case Hyungtak asks.

177
00:10:05,645 --> 00:10:07,880
- Can I send you a message after I arrive at home?
- Nope.

178
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,760
I'm going to bed.

179
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,416
OK.

180
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,629
Then...

181
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:16,580
Good night, Jina.

182
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,660
What the?

183
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,040
[Next episode]
Lee Seungmin will be here in minutes.

184
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,715
Why did you call him when we're hanging out?

185
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:43,639
Get out of my way.

186
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:46,780
- If you mess around with him...
- If I do?

187
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,990
What are you going to do?

188
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,460
I'll kill you.

189
00:10:58,054 --> 00:11:00,867
[Be My Boyfriend]

190
00:11:03,975 --> 00:11:06,125
Oh, right.

191
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:09,005
I forgot telling him the most important thing.

192
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:14,420
If you genuinely care about the girl you like,

193
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,000
she will feel that genuineness, too.
