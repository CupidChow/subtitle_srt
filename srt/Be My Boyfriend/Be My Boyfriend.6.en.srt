1
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,040
Things don't always work out.

2
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,360
Don't mind it too much.

00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:32,746
[-Monthly Evaluation- WHY Ent.]

4
00:00:32,746 --> 00:00:36,910
I know you've been working hard to prepare for the monthly evaluation.

5
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,868
First...

6
00:00:38,868 --> 00:00:40,796
Sung Hanna?

7
00:00:40,796 --> 00:00:43,033
Generally,

8
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:45,911
you looked like an amateur.

9
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:48,325
The entire song was flat-toned.

10
00:00:48,325 --> 00:00:50,435
Your dance didn't have any strength.

11
00:00:50,435 --> 00:00:53,157
It's a total disaster.

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,140
Nobody would think you've been a trainee for six years.

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,400
I'll work harder next time.

14
00:01:03,725 --> 00:01:05,005
Sigh...

15
00:01:05,005 --> 00:01:09,910
I don't think it's about working harder.

16
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,065
Anyway, you tried.

17
00:01:12,065 --> 00:01:13,960
Thank you.

18
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,560
And Oh Jina.

19
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,310
Yes.

20
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,319
How long did you practice?

21
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:24,765
Um...

22
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,480
Don't be nervous.

23
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,745
I asked so I could compliment you.

24
00:01:29,745 --> 00:01:32,075
Just how much practice does it take for someone to get this good?

25
00:01:32,075 --> 00:01:34,095
You're improving so fast that it scares me.

26
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:36,995
Have you really been a trainee for just four years?

27
00:01:36,995 --> 00:01:39,464
I got goosebumps listening to your singing.

28
00:01:39,464 --> 00:01:41,509
Wow.

29
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:42,936
Thank you.

30
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,100
Everyone,

31
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,501

32
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:48,013
Got it?

33
00:01:48,013 --> 00:01:50,194
Yes...

34
00:01:51,515 --> 00:01:53,595
Congratulations.

35
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,530
No.

36
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,780
You were good, too, for real.

38
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:04,960
I don't mean to be harsh, but...

39

Hanna!

00:02:21,346 --> 00:02:22,221
Oh...

41
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:23,579
Where did it go?

42
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:24,811
Are you looking for something?

43
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,231
My earphones.

44
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:28,376
I always put them here. There's no way I would've lost them.

45
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:30,145
Yeah, that's weird.

46
00:02:30,145 --> 00:02:32,190
Why are you the only one losing things these days?

47
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,390

50
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,190
Why?

51
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,725
I'm here to give you this.

52
00:02:54,725 --> 00:02:56,738
What's that?

Clause 9. Wear a couple item.

54
00:02:59,911 --> 00:03:01,190
Since we've been together for 22 days,

55
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,780
this is my gift.

56
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,901
Wow...

57
00:03:03,901 --> 00:03:06,251
We're not kids. Who celebrates the 22nd day?

58
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:07,451
We're still kids.

59
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:09,426
We need to celebrate these while we can.

60
00:03:09,426 --> 00:03:10,637
Hmm...

61
00:03:10,637 --> 00:03:12,931
Really...

62
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:14,559
Wow.

63
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:17,081
It's a backpack called ROOF.

64
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:19,800
I thought it would look good on you.

65
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,200
I heard it's famous for being

66
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,025
a couple item with HOOK backpack.

67
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:25,125
And it turns out

68
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,645
that I have HOOK.

69
00:03:28,645 --> 00:03:31,424
I'll take it since I can't just ignore your gift.

70
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:32,913

Think about what you want to eat.

00:03:36,432 --> 00:03:38,215
Okay!

74
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,103
What?

Gosh.

I love it.

I told you I wasn't sure when practice would end.

thought he's a good person as I spent more time with him.

176
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:18,170
That's true.

177
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,600
Jina.

178
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,132
Do you really

179
00:08:22,132 --> 00:08:25,287
like him?

180
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:26,461
What?

181
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:27,406
Hey!

182
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:30,511
You know we're just pretending to date.

183
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,130
You told me

184
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,998
it's just a contract between you two.

185
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,137
Why?

186
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:51,507
I have a favor to ask.

187
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,140
I was going to go upstairs.

188
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,240
I don't think I can have dinner with you today.

189
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,330
I've got other matters to take care of.

190
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,760
What happened?

191
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,322
I'm not sure.

192
00:09:17,322 --> 00:09:18,955
But I think it's something important.

193
00:09:18,955 --> 00:09:20,315
It's about my agency.

194
00:09:20,315 --> 00:09:24,052
It's too bad. It's our first anniversary.

195
00:09:24,052 --> 00:09:26,137
It's okay.

196
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,130
I'll treat you with something tasty next time.

197
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,762
See you.

198
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,800
Where's Jina?

199
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,705
Huh?

200
00:09:48,705 --> 00:09:50,078
She has other plans.

201
00:09:50,078 --> 00:09:51,910
Oh...

202
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:55,105
Then maybe...

203
00:09:55,105 --> 00:09:58,130
do you want to go to Namgung Jungah's fan signing event with me?

204
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,700
Can I do that?

205
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,385
Sure.

206
00:10:00,385 --> 00:10:03,188
It would be boring if I go there by myself.

207
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,160
I got Namgung Jungah's autograph thanks to you.

208
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,296
Thank you so much.

209
00:10:12,296 --> 00:10:14,361
Then we can go there together next time, too.

210
00:10:14,361 --> 00:10:15,672
What do you want to drink? It's on me.

211
00:10:15,672 --> 00:10:18,113
- Okay.
- What's this?

212
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,920
♫ Ya, you know we’re so different ♫

This is not important right now.

216
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:40,895
Even contract relationships are the same.

217
00:10:40,895 --> 00:10:41,915
They hurt.

218
00:10:41,915 --> 00:10:43,560
You don't deserve to be her boyfriend.

219
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,950
What do you mean?

220
00:10:47,602 --> 00:10:49,536
Oh Jina!
