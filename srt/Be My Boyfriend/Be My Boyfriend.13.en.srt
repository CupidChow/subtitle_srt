[Ba Wool]

3
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:26,350
So I've decided on a way to get past this crisis.

4
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,152
Hello,

5
00:00:35,152 --> 00:00:37,392
students of Hwayang High.

6
00:00:37,392 --> 00:00:39,389
This is Lee Seungmin.

7
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,832
I have something to tell you about the rumors concerning Oh Jina lately.

8
00:00:47,832 --> 00:00:50,579
First of all,

9
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,900
as you all know, Jina and I are in a contract relationship.

10
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,320
- Contract relationship?
- Contract relationship?

11
00:00:57,438 --> 00:01:02,838
And I...  didn't want to go through with this contract.

12
00:01:07,207 --> 00:01:08,874
What?

13
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,600
What?

14
00:01:15,026 --> 00:01:20,411
Because with Jina,  I didn't want a fake contract. I wanted to date her for real.

15
00:01:20,411 --> 00:01:25,181
And it's also true that Jina had the upper hand in our relationship.

16
00:01:25,181 --> 00:01:30,935
But only because I liked her a lot more than she liked me.

17
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:37,190
In all relationships, the person who likes the other more is at a disadvantage.

18
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,390
Really? He locked the door?

19
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,839
Open up. Open up before there's trouble.

20
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:43,637
Hey! Open up!

21
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:48,617
She did call me out all the time, and she did kiss me out of the blue.

22
00:01:48,617 --> 00:01:51,220
I was so bewildered.

23
00:01:52,315 --> 00:01:55,595
I was so nervous that my legs almost gave out.

24
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:04,380
If it weren't for this contract, I would have just had a crush on her.

25
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,201
In that sense,

26
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:10,864
the contract that you've all read around the school was the best opportunity I've had.

27
00:02:12,455 --> 00:02:15,870
So, if it's okay with you,

28
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:23,350
please stop criticizing Jina and support my love for her instead.

29
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:28,328
So that we can start a real relationship after our contract is terminated.

30
00:02:28,328 --> 00:02:29,986
He's such a romantic.

31
00:02:29,986 --> 00:02:31,516
- He's awesome.
- Yeah.

32
00:02:31,516 --> 00:02:33,076
So cool.

33
00:02:33,076 --> 00:02:35,790
- A round of applause!
- A round of applause.

34
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,550
A round of applause.

35

That idiot.

36
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:55,395
Even if everyone else hates me,

37
00:02:55,395 --> 00:02:58,763
if I have that one person who sincerely loves me, I'll be okay.

38
00:02:58,763 --> 00:03:01,072
Just like now.

39

I won't cave in.

Lastly,

42
00:03:19,248 --> 00:03:23,597
I apologize for using the school's equipment like this for my own personal use.

43

[A Few Days Later]

56

After that, the rumors concerning us quieted down

57
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,890
and people started to root for our contract relationship.
