1
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,153
No way.

2
00:00:11,153 --> 00:00:12,390
Is it you?

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,860
The person Hanna told me to meet?

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,260
What do you want to drink?

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,720
I don't think we're close enough to talk about

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,700
what to drink while we sit together. Am I wrong?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,500
Just sit for a little while.

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,080
I'm not going to be

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,960
clingy to you today.

10
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,660
What's all this?

11
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:45,280
I felt bad about not celebrating

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,700
our anniversaries and your birthday while we were going out.

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,300
I called you here to have a party to make up for those days.

14
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,260
So come on and smile a little.

15
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,049
This is my present for our 100th day together.

16
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:02,800
And this is for our 200th day.

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,240
And this is for our 300th day.

18
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,890
And this

19
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,200
is for your birthday not too long ago.

20
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,549
Use this instead of

21
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:17,478
earphones you have to plug in.

22
00:01:21,735 --> 00:01:25,760
There have been some weird things happening to our lockers.

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,680
Make sure you lock them up well.

24
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,340
Sure...

25
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,940
Thanks.

26
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,660
But I didn't want presents like this.

27
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,410
I just wanted for you to be there with me.

28
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,680
Then how about Lee Seungmin?

29
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,210
Is he always by your side?

30
00:01:50,306 --> 00:01:51,680
Yeah.

31
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,735
Thanks to you, I got the autograph of Namgung Jungah.

32
00:01:53,735 --> 00:01:56,080
- Thank you so much.
- Then we can go there together next time, too.

33
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,449
What do you want to drink? My treat.

34
00:01:57,449 --> 00:01:58,986
What's going on?

35
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,759
Is this the important thing

36
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,514
you had to take care of?

37
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:12,012
Huh?

38
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,880
Yeah.

39
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,560
But why are you two together?

40
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,360
We went to Namgung Jungah's fan signing event.

41
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,000
The two of you?

42
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,470
I still have something left to say.

43
00:02:34,165 --> 00:02:36,270
I'll buy next time.

44
00:02:51,295 --> 00:02:52,365
Why did you leave like that?

45
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:54,880
Then how should I have left?

46
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,360
I found out that Koo Hyungtak was here only after I got here.

47
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,520
Isn't that why you're upset?

48
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,160
Then how come you were with Hanna?

49
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,600
She told you earlier that we were at a fan signing event.

50
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,015
Why didn't you tell me?

51
00:03:05,015 --> 00:03:07,095
You told me that something important was going on, so I didn't want to bother you.

52
00:03:07,095 --> 00:03:08,341
But...

53
00:03:08,341 --> 00:03:09,927
that's not the important thing right now, is it?

54
00:03:09,927 --> 00:03:10,952
I...

55
00:03:10,952 --> 00:03:12,980
came here not knowing Koo Hyungtak would be here.

56
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,203
But you went along with Hanna by choice.

57
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:18,440
I think I'm the person that should be upset here.

58
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,075
Am I wrong?

59
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,410
Where are you going?

60
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,710
Even contract relationships are the same as real relationships. They hurt just as much.

61
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:41,467
Ow!

62
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,255
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,020
What about Jina?

64
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,020
She went.

65
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,800
You let her go like that?

66
00:04:10,725 --> 00:04:12,300
My bracelet.

67
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,675
I definitely left it here.

68
00:04:13,675 --> 00:04:14,680
My earphones.

69
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,856
I always keep them here. Where could they have gone?

70
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,698
How come only your things keep disappearing?

71
00:04:18,698 --> 00:04:20,590
What's this?

72
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,230
Why are you following me?

73
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,660
I told you.

74
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,220
That we're going to be together soon.

[We're going to be together soon]
What's this?

76
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,180
You're in our school baseball team, aren't you?

77
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,160
Thanks for recognizing me.

78
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,390
If you come any closer, I'm going to the police. Go on.

79
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:13,465
I don't want to.

80
00:05:15,163 --> 00:05:16,629
What?

81
00:05:35,325 --> 00:05:37,385
She's not answering because she fought with me.

82
00:05:37,385 --> 00:05:40,955
- Don't worry too much...
- Why did you let her go like that?

83
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,720
Did you not hear anything from her?

84
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,860
What do you mean?

85
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,510
And she calls you her boyfriend...

00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,050
What are you talking about?

87
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,780
Some weirdo keeps looking through her locker.

88
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,580
And he left a weird note in her locker a few days ago.

89
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,020
I think she's being stalked, you idiot!

90
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,620
And you let her go alone this late?

Hello!

Go toward her house.

I'll go toward her practice studio.

Okay.

103
00:06:57,705 --> 00:07:00,405
Get lost, you crazy stalker.

104
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,120
Come on, you're upsetting me.

105
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,180
What do you mean, "crazy stalker"?

106
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,740
Be honest. You were attracted to me, too.

107
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,380
Am I wrong?

108
00:07:12,435 --> 00:07:14,230
Honestly, I've thought that you were

109
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,990
pretty for a while.

110
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,035
- Jina.
- Huh?

111
00:07:17,035 --> 00:07:19,780
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you!

112
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,265
I can't do this anymore.

113
00:07:21,265 --> 00:07:22,600
Are you going to let me off the hook now?

114
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,606
No.

115
00:07:23,606 --> 00:07:25,240
I'm breaking up with you now.

116
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,700
And then you just happened

117
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,320
to break up with Koo Hyungtak. Thankfully.

118
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,545
So that's when it started.

119

bumping into each other like fate.
