1
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,120
- Anything to report?
- Nothing unusual.

2
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,680
They're all staying put for now,

3
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,480
but we may see them
move in tomorrow.

4
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,400
And Agent Gray?

5
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,079
He's waiting nearby.

6
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,800
Just give me the key.

7
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,000
I'll drive you, sir.

8
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,280
I'm going alone. Keys.

9
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,160
But Chief...

10
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,000
I understand.

11
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,920
The company is expecting me
tomorrow at the earliest.

12
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,440
You've never seen me, alright?

13
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,400
I understand, sir.

14
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,880
(Jang Dong-gun)

15
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,840
(Kim Myung-min)

16
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,880
(Park Hee-soon)

17
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,880
(Lee Jong-suk)

18
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,240
(Directed by Park Hoon-jung)

19
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,280
How was your flight?

20
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,920
Yeah, I know. Economy sucks.

21
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,080
You know what? I tried very hard
to get you a business class,

22
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,240
but there's been cutbacks
in our budget.

23
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,000
Sorry.

24
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,520
You're not gonna order something?

25
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,080
I know this is a shitty
neighborhood, but this restaurant

26
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,240
they make pretty decent steak,
I gotta tell you.

27
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,800
So, where did you come from?

28
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,720
Erbil.

29
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,760
Erbil? Are we talking Iraq?

30
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,880
You know what? You always
struck me like a field guy.

31
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,200
I knew you would come.

32
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,680
You seem so free.

33
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,000
Got nothing to do?

34
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,920
You see, our friends in Beijing...

35
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,960
They agreed to step back
and look the other way,

36
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,840
and the target won't be able to
move until tomorrow.

37
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,520
Yeah, we don't need to rush.

38
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,520
If Beijing is stepping back,

39
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,200
why not just do it yourself?

40
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,320
You see,

41
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,480
the condition of the agreement was
that we would play this quietly.

42
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,080
But, this whole thing might
end up messy and bloody.

43
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,280
Thus, the call for help, again?

44
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,000
Jerk...

45
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,080
Come on. You're my friend.

46
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,600
Just do me this favor,
and I pay you back. I promise!

47
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,360
I always paid you back!

48
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,080
It's very simple.

49
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,720
All you got to do is to escort
the subject out of that building,

50
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,240
and gently put him in the car,
which is parked over there.

51
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,160
That's all.

52
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,840
This one's for you. A little gift.

53
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,920
It's a Tokarev.

54
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,920
No serial.

55
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,640
And here is the key
to that building.

56
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,440
There're 9 guards on the premise,

57
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,880
and we're gonna close down
the surveillance cameras

58
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,480
for 15 minutes.

59
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,280
So that's gotta be
enough time for you.

60
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,000
You try some. It's very good.

61
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,000
Now what the hell
did you do that for?

62
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,800
I wasn't finished!

63
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,000
Enjoy your meal.

64
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,440
Well, I gotta...

65
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
I gotta order another one.

66
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,120
(1. Prologue)

67
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,480
Shit...

68
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,960
He's the girl's father.

69
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,200
We think he was beaten to death
as soon as he opened the door.

70
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,400
Her brother.

71
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,400
A regional judo athlete.

72
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,880
Is that all?

73
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,160
Well, Unit Chief... Uh...

74
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,520
Gun...

75
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,600
Isn't this a gunshot wound?

76
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,960
The thing is...

77
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,400
Unit Chief!

78
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,160
You worthless piece of shit.

79
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,200
Report properly.

80
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,200
I'm sorry.

81
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,240
Goddamn bastard...

82
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,960
What did you just say?

83
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,560
You want to let that bastard go?

84
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,120
Director comrade...

85
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,800
Are you serious?

86
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,960
If not, what else can we do?

87
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,560
That's what you come up with,
after seeing the photos?

88
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,400
Oh, shut up.

89
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,880
Look here, Comrade Lee.

90
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,480
Why are you stirring things up
in my division?

91
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,800
What?

92
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,120
You should've stayed in Bureau 35,
or either make this a quiet visit.

93
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,680
Why come here to cause a stink?

94
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,440
What are you implying?

95
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,800
How is my background
relevant to this case?

96
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,440
And I'm causing a stink?

97
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,000
Forget it, here.

98
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,920
Your order.

99
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,320
You and your underlings are
now re-assigned

100
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,480
to a fertilizer plant in Daeryong.

101
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,320
What?

102
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,600
Consider yourself lucky.

103
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,280
Had you not served our country

104
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,480
or the Bureau 35 abandoned you,

105
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,280
it would've been
the concentration camp.

106
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,600
I want no more business with you,

107
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,240
so hand over your ID and gun,
and get out!

108
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,040
(Hurray for the Democratic
People's Republic of North Korea!)

109
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,920
Hey, smile for us.

110
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,880
Don't be so nervous, now.

111
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,520
Wow, good! Very good!

112
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,840
Take a photo of me, too.

113
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,040
Closer.

114
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,400
Please...

115
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,080
...don't kill me...

116
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,360
What did she say?

117
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,280
"Don't kill me."

118
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,400
Gonna talk about that
brother of yours again?

119
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,440
The judo athlete?

120
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,120
He's gonna mess us up, eh?

121
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,240
What could this be?

122
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,640
Give me that.

123
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,800
Your brother didn't put up
much of a fight.

124
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,560
Oh yeah, you got
a 5-year-old brother, right?

125
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,880
We tied him up to the window.

126
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,240
Any other family members
you're curious about?

127
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,560
No-one?

128
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,440
Hey, look.

129
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,400
Let me see.

130
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,920
How is it? Feels nice?

131
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,880
Tell us.

132
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,240
Hold her, hold her down.

133
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:39,960
(V.I.P.)

134
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,040
What's that by her legs?

135
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,560
Shit, this is not good...

136
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,000
Hold it up and make sure
there's no gap in between.

137
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,080
Yes, sir.

138
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,880
No, not over there!
Send more men here.

139
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,000
Boss, how much higher?

140
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,800
Not there, just send me more.

141
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,880
It's him, isn't it?

142
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,320
Yes.

143
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,440
At least from the way

144
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,000
the victim was tortured
then murdered.

145
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,200
Let's go, we'll be late.

146
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,200
What? You're leaving?

147
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,920
Is there more to see?

148
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,360
Rain's coming, let's hurry.

149
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,440
Dammit, come with me.

150
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,680
We're just going to leave?

151
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,880
Hey, it's raining!

152
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,080
Go get some plastic cover!

153
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,880
Come on! Hurry the hell up!

154
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,600
Watch your feet!

155
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,800
Another female victim of a
serial killing in Seoul.

156
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,720
A 30-year-old woman was found dead
with evidence of sexual violence.

157
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,040
On the victim's chest and stomach
were stabbing wounds...

158
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,080
The victim was strangled to death,

159
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,160
which led the police to conclude

160
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,760
that this case has relevance to
the Southern Seoul serial murders.

161
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,800
Meanwhile, Detective Jo Sung-oh,
Chief of the Task Force,

162
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,440
unable to bear the pressure
of this serial murder case...

163
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,840
Seoul Metro Police stated that

164
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,520
Detective Jo's body was found

165
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,320
in his car, stationed under a hill
just behind his home.

166
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,560
Burned charcoal was discovered
inside the vehicle,

167
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,960
but no will.

168
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,280
Jo's body was moved to a
nearby hospital

169
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,440
after 3 hours of
forensic analysis on site.

170
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,400
The bereaved family will hold
his funeral this afternoon,

171
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,520
and Jo will be rested at a
charnel house near Seoul...

172
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,440
(2. The Suspect)

173
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,160
Shit, the case can't be
any more twisted than this.

174
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,760
Jo, that bastard...

175
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,640
How could he drop everything
and kill himself now?

176
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,480
Damned coward...

177
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,640
You know what this means
for us, don't you?

178
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,960
We're close to being goners.

179
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,800
I think we already are.

180
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,920
You bastard...

181
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,160
Anyway,

182
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,800
I got no one else to replace him.

183
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:37,080
Even if there was a candidate,
it'll take time to fill him in.

184
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,080
Honestly,

185
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,040
you were the go-to man
on the field before Jo.

186
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,080
Why don't you get your boys

187
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,440
and wrap this up quickly?

188
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,600
I know how you feel about this.

189
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,400
I really do, shit...

190
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,480
It wasn't long ago that we played
dirty to kick you off the force.

191
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,600
Right?

192
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,560
What about my suspension, then?

193
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,360
Revoked?

194
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,400
Must you make me say it?
Of course.

195
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,280
Not gonna make excuses later?

196
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,200
Trust me for once!

197
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,920
You want it in writing?

198
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,160
Just solve the case,

199
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,880
and I'll make sure to
have your records restored

200
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,760
crystal-clear, like how it was
before the suspension.

201
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,440
Solve it by any means necessary?

202
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,880
Yes, but please... Go easy.

203
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,720
I know you go off the books.

204
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,920
If you go out of bounds,
it'll have consequences.

205
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,360
So take it easy, okay?

206
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,400
Then find the bastard that way.

207
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,520
You bastard...

208
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,560
Decide now,
or I'll be late for the funeral.

209
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,960
Yeah, do whatever you please.

210
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,200
Just solve the case.

211
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,160
Understood.

212
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,400
No bruises though, this time.

213
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,040
He's gotta be presentable
to the media!

214
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,200
Don't make him a cripple again
like the other guys!

215
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,920
Chae!

216
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,920
(Jo Sung-oh)

217
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,560
(Fight another day!)

218
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,360
(To: Detective Jo Sung-oh)

219
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,120
What's that?

220
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,200
Sir?

221
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,680
Oh, these are the
tip-offs we received.

222
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,840
Put them here.

223
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,120
We usually check each one, but...

224
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,800
After Det. Jo's suicide,

225
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,680
we didn't get a chance yet.

226
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,720
(Detective Jo Sung-oh)

227
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,160
We got a call from the lab.

228
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,480
The lab?

229
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,880
They got something?

230
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,040
Did we send them a sample?

231
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,320
I did.

232
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,520
A month ago before I got the boot.

233
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,240
Why? Got a problem?

234
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,560
- And?
- They think they found something.

235
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,800
- Come.
- Yes, sir.

236
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,840
Suit up!

237
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:32,520
This was inside the eggplant
found in the victim #7's vagina.

238
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,360
It was so small that
we overlooked it the first time.

239
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,160
But we found something,
just like you said we would.

240
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,960
Want to take a look?

241
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,000
They're the epithelial cells
under the fingernail,

242
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,680
and they don't match
the victim's DNA.

243
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,880
Okay, so this must be...

244
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,000
We had a match with the other
tissues samples we found on her,

245
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,000
so he's our suspect.
Our key suspect.

246
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,040
"Suspect"? Are you new to this?

247
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,000
It's the perp,
this bastard is the killer.

248
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,240
But not 100%.

249
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,080
- Take care.
- See you.

250
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,240
- Bye.
- Okay.

251
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,040
Match it with all our list
of suspects,

252
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,880
and the ex-cons who used the
same killing methods.

253
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,920
Obtain DNA from all suspects,
anything we can compare to.

254
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,720
- Find them, got it?
- Yes, sir!

255
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,800
You obtain DNA samples
from these guys.

256
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,720
Oh, this? Chief,

257
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,640
we received a few of them already.

258
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,440
When something happens,
we get bogus tips like these.

259
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,360
Our hands will be tied,
if we have to check all of them.

260
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,360
What I mean is...

261
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,360
The bastards at the hospital won't
cooperate since it's illegal...

262
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,640
And you must not know
about these pricks, but you see...

263
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,680
Det. Jo also had to...

264
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,360
So damn yappy.

265
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,080
Shut your hole
and stand up straight.

266
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,240
- At attention.
- Hurts...

267
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,120
You grew a tongue
while I was away.

268
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,800
- Did you forget how I work?
- No, sir.

269
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,600
Should I care
who these pricks are?

270
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,160
I'm sorry, sir.

271
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,800
I don't care who they are,

272
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,000
unless they're the killers.
Got a problem with that?

273
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,480
Of course not, sir.

274
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,640
Right, the hospital?

275
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,960
Of course they won't cooperate.
it's illegal.

276
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,080
But so what?

277
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,000
Will you halt the case
because of that?

278
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,360
No, sir.

279
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,720
Why don't you use
that goddamn excuse?

280
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,840
Say you can't catch the killer
for lack of cooperation.

281
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,280
I'm sorry, sir.

282
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,760
Stop being sorry.

283
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,960
Yes, sir.

284
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,400
You got that?

285
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,520
Yes, boss!

286
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,040
I know how you worked till now,

287
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,360
so take your badges off
if that's all you got.

288
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,640
The only thing that should be
in your head is the killer.

289
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,760
The process means shit.

290
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,000
Focus on catching that bastard
and putting cuffs on him.

291
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,560
Everything else...

292
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,880
...is totally irrelevant to you.
Got that?

293
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,040
Yes, sir.

294
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,360
Got that?

295
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,720
Yes, boss!

296
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,320
Then move!

297
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,360
Bastards...

298
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,880
With no further
developments on the case,

299
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,840
many citizens are still fearful.

300
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:32,160
Unable to leave the house freely,
the citizens want the police...

301
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,320
That means shit for us. So?

302
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,560
Is the info solid?

303
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,840
You saw the report yourself.

304
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,800
The police got it right,
it's those dicks.

305
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,320
How old is the intel?

306
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,120
That damned Agent Gray
gave it to us an hour ago.

307
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,080
An hour ago?

308
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,240
That's bullshit.

309
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,840
Only top-ranking officers
can see this report.

310
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,520
Come on now,
this is Seoul.

311
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,000
It's like their home ground.

312
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,880
Good for them.

313
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,040
So what?

314
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,640
Get with it.

315
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,080
Do you even need to ask?

316
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,520
What a moron.

317
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,520
Look.

318
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,080
This can't happen.

319
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,720
These dicks...

320
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,440
...especially that big dick...
He can't be the killer.

321
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,440
When they were
brought here 2 years ago,

322
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:53,000
I planned it
and you carried it out.

323
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,800
And we both got cushy jobs
because of it.

324
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,200
It's been a month
since we got a new boss.

325
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,160
Promotion announcements
will be made soon.

326
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,560
We backed the wrong horse
and ended up in this shit.

327
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,880
So if we don't stop this,

328
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,000
both of us are out for good.

329
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,200
I told you to go easy
with playing politics.

330
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,760
I knew that old man
wouldn't last long.

331
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,720
Shut up, bastard.

332
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,800
This is a jungle.
Everything is politics.

333
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,720
The weak is torn apart,
if you won't lick ass.

334
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,960
And tell me, who watched
your back until now?

335
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,800
So what, then?

336
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,440
- Bury the whole thing?
- The Yankees won't stay put.

337
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,120
They went apeshit trying to
get those dicks out of the North.

338
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,920
The company will find out,

339
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,160
and there'll be backlash.

340
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,120
We'll settle that later.

341
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,600
Let's locate them first.

342
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,800
If they're desperate,
they'll give us something.

343
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,280
That's our only play right now.

344
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,280
What about their handlers?

345
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,280
Wasn't someone looking after them?
What have they been doing?

346
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,480
I know...

347
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,560
We received orders to

348
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:11,400
go easy on the dick, and...

349
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,800
From whom?

350
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,320
That bastard Gray?

351
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,920
But that's not all.

352
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,719
He messed up with my agents.

353
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,920
So it's all gone to hell, huh?

354
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,000
Your temper can wait.
Let's get a move on, though.

355
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,719
I sent some agents over there,
we gotta find a way out first.

356
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,520
If we're not careful,

357
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,480
it's a one-way to hell.

358
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,480
Yeah?

359
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,800
The police are on the move.

360
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,120
How?

361
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,280
I'm sure they haven't
got a warrant yet.

362
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,000
Emergency arrest, probably.

363
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,480
Where are you?

364
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,160
We're almost there.

365
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,440
What have you been doing?
What's taking so long?

366
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,960
Taking a trip somewhere?

367
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,440
I'm sorry, sir.
There's a bit of traffic...

368
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,880
Hurry, secure the target first.

369
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,080
You owe me one, okay?

370
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,080
Debt is there to be paid off.

371
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,040
Call me if you need anything,

372
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,440
I'll pay back big time.

373
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,960
Very good.

374
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,640
But this is no easy foe,
will you be okay?

375
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,840
A VIP from North Korea...
With a VIP this size,

376
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,360
the agency won't be too pleased.

377
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,920
We're not in a position to

378
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
take their feelings into account.

379
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,520
But my colleague burning charcoals
to death is my business.

380
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,800
if this doesn't work out,
my team'll be next.

381
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,480
But isn't that what
got you reinstated?

382
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,720
Life is full of ironies, no?

383
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,240
He got you
the disciplinary action,

384
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,400
but also gave you a lifeline.

385
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,800
Am I right?

386
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,120
Everything's a blessing
in disguise.

387
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,120
Yes?

388
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,160
Okay, got it.

389
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,560
- It's ready.
- Hold up.

390
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,200
I'll go see to him
and hand him over to you.

391
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,080
You know we're just around for
the show and cake.

392
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,600
Det. Chae.

393
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,720
Good luck!

394
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,320
We arrived here first,

395
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,200
but the police barged in.

396
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,520
So what?

397
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,800
Did you secure the target?

398
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,720
Well...

399
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,120
we haven't exactly
secured the target, but...

400
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,720
Make way!

401
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,200
Don't shove! Let's talk it out.

402
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,040
Out of the way!

403
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,600
Make way!

404
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,880
Kim Gwang-il.

405
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,320
You're under arrest for violating
the National Security Law.

406
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,520
What National Security Law?

407
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,640
Here are your rights.

408
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,080
You've the right to remain silent,
and to consult an attorney.

409
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,480
Anything you say may be...

410
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,840
That'll do.

411
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,120
We'll finish the rest.

412
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,120
How about an intro?

413
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,240
Intelligence? Nice.

414
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,160
He broke
the National Security Law.

415
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,560
He'll need to come with us.

416
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,880
National Security Law?

417
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,240
Right, that.

418
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,480
We're in a bind,
this complicates things.

419
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,000
He's a murder suspect,

420
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,680
serial killing, no less.

421
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,400
You heard of those recent
Southern Seoul killings?

422
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,320
They're his work.

423
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,720
You got evidence?

424
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,240
That should be discussed
with the lawyers.

425
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,920
No need to worry,

426
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,400
we got irrefutable evidence.

427
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,600
Anyway, we arrested him first,

428
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,800
we have the jurisdiction.

429
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,240
We'll aid
your investigation later.

430
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,320
Come on now.

431
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,520
That's not how this works.

432
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,680
See this?

433
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,760
It's a warrant, an arrest warrant.

434
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,080
A warrant issued by the
honorable district judge himself.

435
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,600
You got one too? No?

436
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,000
Then who has the jurisdiction?
Huh?

437
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,600
Why? Wanna bypass the court too?

438
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,080
Come on, boys! Take him away.

439
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,680
- Sure!
- Yes, sir!

440
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,680
Out of the way, make way.

441
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,960
Thank you and take care.

442
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:54,360
What's this? You said the warrant
was being taken care of!

443
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,160
My contacts at the court
bailed on me.

444
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,080
That's your excuse?

445
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,360
Fine, hold on,

446
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,680
I'm going to get the court to...

447
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,560
That ship has sailed.

448
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,120
The police aren't idiots.

449
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,720
They can reach out to
the media and have a feast.

450
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,800
Come on, this isn't a normal case.

451
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,160
It's a serial killing case.

452
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,600
If this blows up,
it's all game over.

453
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,160
Once Chae Yi-do goes on TV,
we're finished.

454
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,240
Do everything in your power
to stop that, at all cost.

455
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,200
Send a lawyer to Kim and

456
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,800
tell him to stall
the investigation.

457
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,560
And get the security cam feeds
around his home and office

458
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,040
before the cops do.

459
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,560
Right away.

460
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,560
What about Kim's minions?
Have you secured them?

461
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,040
Well, they must've...

462
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,880
...gone dark, because we can't
find them anywhere.

463
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,920
- Both of them?
- Yes, sir.

464
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,280
For some time, it looks like.

465
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,960
Damned idiots...

466
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,800
Is this how they managed them?

467
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,040
Find them at all cost.

468
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,400
The lawyer can't stall too long,
find them before then.

469
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,200
Get their corpses if you have to.

470
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,640
Yes, sir.

471
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,840
Let's move!

472
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,440
(3. Attack and Defense)

473
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,360
Please... Don't kill me...

474
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,960
I didn't do anything wrong,
please let me go...

475
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,120
As it's pointed out
in the fax I sent earlier,

476
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,480
my client was on a road trip
with his friends in the south

477
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:56,040
during the estimated time
of the murder,

478
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,320
when he supposedly left his
epithelial cells on the site.

479
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:04,400
And this is a list of his alibis.

480
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,600
Oh, we'll look into that
later for sure.

481
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,920
But how will you refute
the DNA evidence?

482
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,840
Why was your client's DNA
found on the victim?

483
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,640
Oh that...

484
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,560
Shit, so he can talk.

485
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,200
I thought you were a goddamn mute.

486
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:36,880
And you don't stare down
at cops here in the South.

487
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,680
That stupid smirk...

488
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,480
Alright, let me hear you.

489
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,080
How did your DNA come
out of the victim's vagina?

490
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,920
We started a weekend farm
as a hobby.

491
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,520
We got a small land near our home.

492
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,880
It's got some cucumber
and eggplants, too.

493
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,520
Here.

494
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,720
Quite a bit of eggplants.

495
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,720
They give away the harvest
to their friends and neighbors.

496
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,760
One eggplant is hardly
irrefutable evidence.

497
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,200
We'll look into this as well.

498
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,400
So you arrest first
and come up with evidence?

499
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,760
Get with the times, detective.

500
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,160
If you find more
solid evidence, call us.

501
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,640
But send him home for today.

502
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,400
The warrant was issued today.

503
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,080
We can still...

504
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,720
...hold him for another 42 hours.

505
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,320
Anyway, nice meeting you,
and see you again.

506
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,720
Oh yeah, Mr. Kim.

507
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,400
Guess you don't know me well yet.

508
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:03,480
Keep that smirk on
while you can.

509
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,280
Buddy.

510
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,720
I only said we got your DNA,

511
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,840
but nothing about an eggplant.

512
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,920
How did you know
it was off an eggplant?

513
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,320
And you even prepped
a photo of the farm too.

514
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,440
Open up.

515
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,680
They take me
for a goddamn fool?

516
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,880
Dig into his alibis' whereabouts.

517
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,520
Find everything and anything
you can about these pricks.

518
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,760
- Got that?
- Yes, sir.

519
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,000
- Anything from Kim's house?
- We ransacked it,

520
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,120
but nothing useful.

521
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,280
What about his minions?

522
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,760
I sent out APB for their arrest.

523
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,920
Find them fast, bastard,
they're accomplices.

524
00:46:59,000 --> 00:46:59,880
Of course, sir.

525
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,640
-Find them, bastards!
-Sure.

526
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,960
Go to the info division
and dig into the lawyer.

527
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,440
Especially his bank account.
Should focus there.

528
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,200
Check his bank records
and see who paid his retainer.

529
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,760
How can we do that?

530
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,200
Stop asking me to shit...

531
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,600
...I mean, how will you
handle the backlash?

532
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,760
You jerk again...

533
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,920
You'll make me say it again?

534
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,400
Sorry, sir.

535
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,200
I'll take care of the shit,

536
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,880
so you just
bring me results, alright?

537
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,400
Or you still don't get it?

538
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,400
Yes, sir, I get it.

539
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,600
Get a move on,
why're your feet on the ground?

540
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,560
You two, track the alibis.

541
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,280
- Get a move on!
- Yes, sir!

542
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,040
Run, bastards!

543
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,560
Thought those bastards
could fool me?

544
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,320
(Cafeteria)

545
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,080
- Over here!
- Sorry about that.

546
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,280
- Took you long enough.
- Sorry.

547
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,800
- Are you new?
- Yes.

548
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,520
- It took so long.
- Lunch is here!

549
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,920
Sorry for being late.

550
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,880
It's gone all cold.

551
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,040
Easy on the wheels.

552
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,040
Hey, I asked for rice and noodles!

553
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,160
Come get lunch.

554
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,440
Good work, everyone.

555
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,760
Security cams near
Kim's home and work

556
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,560
were already taken
by the intelligence.

557
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,760
It's okay.

558
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,680
There are enough cams out there.

559
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,680
We got tons of dash cams.

560
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,480
Taking some of them won't hurt us.

561
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,760
Go through what we got.

562
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,720
Scour every minute
and every second.

563
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,600
- We'll get a hit.
- Yes, sir!

564
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,880
Let's split it up evenly.

565
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,080
Firewall is off.

566
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,640
Frequency tracking is complete.

567
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,320
Can we mirror

568
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,040
what they're watching?

569
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,440
Yes, if they are online.

570
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,720
Bringing it up on channel 1.

571
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,240
- That one as well.
- Coming online.

572
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,080
Those dumb bastards...

573
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,520
They're seriously going to
comb through everything?

574
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,120
Sitrep on Kim's boys.

575
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,840
Not yet, sir.

576
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,120
Cops will be all over them,

577
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,960
put more agents on it.

578
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,600
Yes, sir.

579
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,600
(Seoul Gaebong Police Station)

580
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,440
(Cafeteria)

581
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,120
Alright everyone, focus!

582
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,080
- Food is here.
- Why are you always late?

583
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,840
Let's eat, guys.

584
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,400
Chief, I think I got a hit!

585
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,600
Let's see.

586
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,840
Here! I got him too!

587
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,560
- Where?
- Seoul tollgate.

588
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,360
Chief! Here too!

589
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,640
Me too.

590
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,520
Over here.

591
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,680
Guess what this is.

592
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,520
Go on a road trip?
Is that your alibis?

593
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,560
You got a teleportation machine?

594
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:38,680
Why don't you check
the date and time.

595
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,840
We found you in Seoul,
here, here,

596
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,280
and here, too.

597
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,080
While your alibis were elsewhere

598
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,600
during that time.

599
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,600
Got anything else to say?

600
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,080
Anything at all?

601
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,400
You're finished, bastard.

602
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,680
Where's that smirk now, huh?

603
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,000
Yes.

604
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,160
I understand.

605
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,160
We'll move in right away.

606
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,840
Yes, sir.

607
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,640
We found him, Kim's minion.

608
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,560
Drink while it's warm.
It's Solomon's seal tea.

609
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,880
Without company approval,

610
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,680
what have you two been doing

611
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,360
with American spies?

612
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,800
I'm sorry, sir.

613
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,800
Paul Gray...

614
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,320
Of all the Yankees, you had to
side with the worst one.

615
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,960
Didn't something feel fishy
from the beginning?

616
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,400
Kim Gwang-il is
the only son of Kim Mo-sul,

617
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:20,280
the holder of Jang Sung-taek's
China account!

618
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,960
The CIA has never handed over
anyone like him before.

619
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,120
Those bastards...

620
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,200
...already knew who
Kim Gwang-il was.

621
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,320
And you two took the bait
without knowing anything.

622
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,960
Dumb bastards...

623
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,080
So?

624
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,320
Pardon?

625
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,800
So what will you do now?

626
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:49,240
The police debunked the alibis,
they're under pressure, too.

627
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:56,520
From the start, the alibis were
to buy us time.

628
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,520
Can you finish the job
without him?

629
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,480
Taking his head is enough.

630
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:12,960
I don't need yours too

631
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,760
Get the police off your back,

632
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,240
and wrap this up by
handing Kim over to the CIA.

633
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,760
If this ends well,
you'll see another day.

634
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,600
If the company reputation
is tainted,

635
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,080
you two will be our scapegoats

636
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,480
for all to see, got that?

637
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:39,480
Yes, sir,
I'll sort it out quietly.

638
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,920
Drink up, it's getting cold.

639
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,320
I couldn't reach you,

640
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,480
so I had to drop in like this.

641
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,200
If I'm not reachable,
that means something.

642
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,000
Are you thick?

643
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,640
Did you do okay in school?

644
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,200
I have something to tell you.

645
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,760
I know what you came to say,

646
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,720
and I already told your boss off.

647
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,120
You're in no position to

648
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,280
tell us to halt the case.

649
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,480
We're not doing this
over a parking ticket.

650
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,000
This a serial killing case,

651
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,920
with 7 confirmed victims!

652
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,000
If this doesn't get solved soon,

653
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,680
the media will have my neck.

654
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,200
So my apologies to you,

655
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,880
but I can't help you on this.
My hands are full already.

656
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,760
Let's deal with our
own business, alright?

657
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:31,000
And don't go looking for me
at a place like this,

658
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,120
it's embarrassing!

659
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,960
And it's rather awkward
for the both of us.

660
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,920
I'm not asking you to halt.

661
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,440
Continue the case.

662
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,720
However,

663
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,440
I'd like to give you something.

664
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,120
What?

665
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,880
Another freebie?

666
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,680
Let's help each other.

667
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:01,960
Get him ready.

668
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,200
What's going on?

669
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,360
Come with us.

670
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,600
Will he be okay?

671
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,520
He was raised by Kim's family
like their own pet.

672
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,120
He will die for Kim, if he has to.

673
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,440
Shit, what's this?

674
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,600
What did you just say?

675
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,640
Release Kim?

676
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,880
We got the offender,
so let him go.

677
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,680
No, he's not the one.

678
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,360
Kim's the real killer.

679
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,240
That bastard is just a pawn.

680
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:02,960
Take a look.

681
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,360
What is it?

682
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,320
It's from the lab.

683
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,920
The pawn's DNA was recovered

684
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:13,480
from victim #3, 5 and 7's
personal items.

685
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,240
Is that so?

686
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:21,080
How do evidence we
couldn't find suddenly surface?

687
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,840
And this.

688
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:24,840
You must have this, too.

689
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,960
This guy was captured
on the security cams

690
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,840
near where the bodies were found.

691
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,760
And we got a full confession.

692
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,440
So who else is the killer?

693
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,200
Where did you get all these?

694
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,160
Who gave them to you?

695
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:42,440
Detective, this is enough.

696
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,880
Let's wrap it up here.

697
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,200
We got the killer, so that's that.

698
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,600
They went this far
to make us look good,

699
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,960
why not return the favor?

700
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,080
"They"?

701
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,240
Hand Kim over.

702
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,520
Eyes forward when driving.

703
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,200
Sir? Sorry.

704
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,920
Finish Kim's report tomorrow
and hand him to the prosecution.

705
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,520
What? But that's...

706
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:28,560
Yes, sir.

707
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:32,120
Press conference in the morning,
so get the media ready.

708
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,920
Wait, drop me off at my place.
I need to change.

709
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:36,720
Okay.

710
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,560
I'll be right over once
I get changed,

711
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,760
so go finish up the report on Kim.

712
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,720
What? But Chief!

713
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,960
- Shut up and go.
- Yes, boss.

714
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,120
- Go on.
- Bye.

715
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,080
Who is it this time?

716
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:35,160
Thought you wouldn't be
home tonight again.

717
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,240
Who are you?
I don't think we're acquainted.

718
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,920
Maybe you got the wrong house?

719
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,280
I don't remember cuffing you.

720
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,840
That's you, isn't it?

721
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:56,800
So?

722
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,360
How's Gwang-il doing?

723
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,640
Who are you?

724
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:22,080
Your eyes say
you're a hunting dog.

725
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,320
We must be in
the same line of work.

726
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:29,040
Gangwon province?
Your accent is familiar.

727
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,720
Up north.

728
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,840
North? Northern Gangwon?

729
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:38,200
You got a case on Kim?

730
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:40,160
12 confirmed victims.

731
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:45,520
4 cases in which he wiped out
the victims' families.

732
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,480
You're being dramatic.

733
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,640
How does it look?

734
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,280
The killing methods are similar,
aren't they?

735
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:12,920
He toys with the victim...

736
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,400
...and kills her in the end.

737
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,320
I'm from the North.

738
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:33,240
To catch that
bloodthirsty bastard.

739
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,720
Lee Dae-beom,
Security Division from the North.

740
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,200
(Det. Kim)

741
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,600
- You're under arrest...
- Out of my way!

742
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,520
for violating
the National Security Law.

743
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,200
You have the right
to remain silent...

744
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,720
What the hell's going on?

745
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,880
Beat it, bastards.

746
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:29,000
That bastard's mine,
don't you dare step in!

747
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,280
Chief, you can't do this.

748
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,840
Enough of this bullshit
and get the hell out.

749
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,440
You got shit in your ears?

750
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:37,480
What do you think you're doing?

751
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,160
This matter has been settled.

752
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,560
Chief, calm down,

753
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,400
it's an order from the top!

754
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,080
Let go.

755
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,160
Let go of me. Let go!

756
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,640
Chief, please...

757
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:54,560
Sons of... Are you all nuts?

758
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,920
Chief, just this once.

759
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,280
You dare smirk?

760
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:02,680
Is that a smirk?
Why, you bastard...

761
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,400
Stop that!

762
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,000
Don't touch him!

763
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,080
I said, let go!

764
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,520
Did you just laugh? Is this funny?

765
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:14,160
But it's funny,
should I cry instead?

766
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:17,960
What? You bastard...

767
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:25,400
Have you ever heard that sound?

768
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,160
It's my favorite.

769
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:33,080
Do you know what sound people make
as they die?

770
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,840
Especially when
the young girls die.

771
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,320
The moan of pain.
Man, it's something.

772
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,640
Demented bastard...

773
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:55,000
By the way, how'd the funeral go
for the idiot who killed himself?

774
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:56,840
Shut your mouth.

775
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:00,360
You know what sound they make
when they suffocate?

776
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,920
Don't feel so embarrassed,

777
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,600
your predecessor wasn't the first.

778
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,360
You little bastard!

779
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:11,320
- Hold him back!
- This bastard...

780
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,480
Chief!

781
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:13,640
I'll kill him!

782
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:17,360
Got any more wisdom to spill?
Because I'll kill you!

783
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,280
Chief! Chief!

784
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:20,560
Kill me?

785
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,600
Pitiful bastards.

786
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,200
If you can, why don't you?

787
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:29,840
Why you...

788
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:31,960
- Chief! Chief!
- Let go of me!

789
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,720
Why you...

790
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:43,800
I said let go, bastards!

791
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,520
Stop the reporters! Stop them!

792
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:02,000
I said, let go!

793
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,360
You're photogenic.

794
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:10,800
You didn't know?

795
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,720
You could be an actor.
An action star.

796
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:19,680
But at least only this site

797
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,479
ran with your story.

798
01:08:22,279 --> 01:08:25,800
Other sites focused on
closing the case, what a relief.

799
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:32,279
Hey, I was up all night calling in

800
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,359
for favors to pull that off.

801
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:38,920
You're suspended for a while.

802
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:42,840
From arresting and
assaulting wrong suspects,

803
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:45,120
your record is already
filled with assaults.

804
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,399
You should've been
fired for this,

805
01:08:47,479 --> 01:08:50,040
but at least the case is closed.

806
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:54,120
We decided to wrap this up
with a short suspension.

807
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:58,960
Stay low for now, okay?

808
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,120
Holy cow!

809
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,600
Why that jerk...

810
01:09:21,399 --> 01:09:24,120
South Korea can't touch him.

811
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,720
It's a soar eye
to your intelligence division.

812
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,359
Even if you wanted something done,

813
01:09:30,439 --> 01:09:32,479
you got Yankees
for a puppet master.

814
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,040
So what, then?

815
01:09:37,399 --> 01:09:39,359
You're saying you can?

816
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,359
So why didn't you?

817
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:47,439
Why let him go wild
and wait till the 12th victim?

818
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,399
At the time, his father Kim Mo-sul

819
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:53,120
was Jang's right-hand man.

820
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:58,920
In other words, he was
"royal family." Untouchable.

821
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:01,800
So we got hit instead.

822
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,640
It was a night ambush.

823
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,640
Two of my men were beheaded,

824
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:14,360
and I took a bullet and
fell into the Yalu River.

825
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,640
All the top brass knew
about it but it was covered up.

826
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:25,680
So what's changed?

827
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,800
What will you do?

828
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,400
Just before Kim defected
to the South 2 years ago,

829
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:37,160
Kim Mo-sul and his men were
charged for counter-revolution.

830
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,240
Which means
we can now get him, too.

831
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:44,480
Hand him over.

832
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:48,960
I guarantee you,
the South won't prosecute him.

833
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:10,880
(4. V.I.P. from the North)

834
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,880
- Tired?
- Nope.

835
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,600
I doubt that.
Is everything settled?

836
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,640
Yes, just the tidying-up now.

837
01:11:58,720 --> 01:11:59,920
All docs are shredded.

838
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:05,280
Then check Kim Ji-won's
border-crossing route for me.

839
01:12:58,120 --> 01:12:59,040
What's this?

840
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,840
It's you?

841
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:08,040
Yes, sir.

842
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,400
About 5 years ago,

843
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:12,560
in Peshawar, sir.

844
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,720
Oh, Peshawar.

845
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:21,040
So the Pakistani job was yours?

846
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,200
I see.

847
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:25,880
You field agents belong out there,

848
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:29,040
why bother with a desk job?

849
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:33,840
So stick with what you're good at.

850
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:38,680
When is the exchange?

851
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,960
We're in talks.

852
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,800
Gray won't just take him,

853
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,120
Kim's a handful.

854
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:51,760
But he won't give up on
what Kim knows.

855
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:57,440
We notified we won't babysit Kim,
so they'll be an answer soon.

856
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,000
Good.

857
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:05,160
Let's wrap it up nicely, alright?

858
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,080
I don't want any more trouble.

859
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,840
Gather up the remaining
loose-ends as well.

860
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:13,560
And move into this office.

861
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,760
By the way,

862
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
that blind doesn't fit,
change the color.

863
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:43,720
What is it?

864
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,360
Where the hell is he?

865
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,240
I'm sorry,
I went out for a smoke...

866
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,200
Are you insane?

867
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,440
I'm sorry, sir.

868
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:26,320
Kim Gwang-il,

869
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:28,920
you think we're easy?

870
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,280
Don't you fret,

871
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:33,920
I didn't do much with this girl.

872
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:35,240
I was simply...

873
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:40,720
Whoa. Hold up.

874
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,760
What? "This girl"?

875
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:59,240
Tell me again, what did you say?

876
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,440
"This girl"?

877
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:03,360
What do you mean?

878
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,200
You know,
the girl you gave me before.

879
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,920
What about their handlers?

880
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:12,680
I'm sure they had some,

881
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:14,280
what have they been doing?

882
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,240
Well, uh...

883
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,680
We received orders to

884
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:22,600
go easy on the dick.

885
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:25,360
But that's not all.

886
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,720
He messed up with my agents.

887
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,720
You didn't...

888
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:37,680
I just had some fun
with them, too.

889
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,240
I didn't kill them.

890
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,280
You bastard!

891
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:53,440
Buddy.

892
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:55,240
You psycho bastard,

893
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:58,400
you got a death wish?

894
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,600
Should I just end you here?

895
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:07,880
Is this really part of your job?

896
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,640
Shouldn't you be
protecting me till the end?

897
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:22,200
The Yankees won't be
too happy about this.

898
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:24,240
I've had it with you!

899
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,480
Boss, please calm down!

900
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,520
You'll kill him at this rate!

901
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:31,400
Please calm down.

902
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,760
Cuff his feet too.

903
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:40,520
Toss him in the corner
so he can't move.

904
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:41,760
Right away.

905
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:48,920
Get on the ground!

906
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:51,480
Hold him tight!

907
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:28,360
Who the hell are you?

908
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,680
Know when to quit.

909
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:34,920
Did it cross your mind,

910
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:37,280
that maybe I don't want to answer?

911
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,880
Have you considered my words?

912
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:40,960
What?

913
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:43,680
Oh, you're the Northern spy.

914
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:46,440
I was right, wasn't I?

915
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:58,320
Will you hand Kim over now?

916
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:01,720
Are you kidding me?

917
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,200
I've been stripped.

918
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:07,840
I can help you.

919
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:11,840
Help with what?

920
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:17,480
The bastard's gone.

921
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,000
Give it up.

922
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,640
The game is over, pal.

923
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,760
No.

924
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,080
It's not over.

925
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:34,360
At least I know how to
extend this game.

926
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:44,480
Prior to arriving in Seoul
two years ago,

927
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,400
Kim and his minions
stayed in Hong Kong

928
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,720
and left 2 open cases.

929
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:55,360
They tortured, killed the girls,
recorded the whole thing,

930
01:19:56,600 --> 01:20:02,280
and sold the snuff film
to fund their escape.

931
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,840
Kim's face is on that video.

932
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:20,440
(Hong Kong Causeway Bay Case:
Murder of Cho Yu-na)

933
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:27,320
If it's Hong Kong...

934
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:32,400
One of the victims was
a Korean residing in Hong Kong.

935
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,480
Did you verify?

936
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,360
Yes, we did.

937
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:53,200
His face is visible.

938
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,480
Make enough copies
and gather everyone.

939
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,760
Even the off-duty!

940
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:02,880
District Attorney,

941
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:05,240
let me ask you another favor
while at it.

942
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:24,600
It's been a long, long time,
Mr. Kim.

943
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,160
Two years, right?

944
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,800
You look good,
it's gotta be the water in Seoul.

945
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:37,920
Now after what I heard, things are
not too going to well for you.

946
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,000
I'm sorry to hear that.

947
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:43,720
And you picked up some sick hobby.

948
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:48,160
Couldn't you have picked up
something a bit more refined? Huh?

949
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:52,720
Isn't that why you released me
in the first place?

950
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,640
So it would come to this.

951
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:00,600
You got a point.

952
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,160
So what now? Hmm?

953
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:06,280
Sounds like you are
in desperate need of help.

954
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,680
Please don't get me wrong.

955
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:10,600
I don't care what the hell
you were doing in Seoul.

956
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:14,280
Now what I am trying to
figure out is,

957
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:19,280
what value you hold and
if it's worth protecting.

958
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,960
Do I really need you?

959
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:26,400
Honestly, when I look back on
these last two years,

960
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,960
I'm not so sure.

961
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:29,760
What do you think?

962
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:37,560
Why did you guys relocate me from
Hong Kong in the first place?

963
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:41,160
I asked you a question.
You piece of shit.

964
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,320
You haven't changed at all, huh?

965
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:49,160
Now, the only reason
you were relocated

966
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:53,720
was because of the Chinese
bank account your father manages.

967
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:58,840
And we assumed that
he had given you

968
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,520
all the information to that
account when you left North Korea.

969
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,400
So?

970
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,040
So what?

971
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:09,680
I think you know
the answer to my question.

972
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,720
We couldn't find
any money, Mr. Kim.

973
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:15,800
Only some petty cash of yours.

974
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,320
Which leads me to wonder
if you knew anything at all.

975
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:23,960
You really think so?

976
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:26,600
What I think is not important.

977
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:29,560
It's up to you to prove I'm wrong.

978
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:34,880
Oh I forgot to tell you,

979
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,840
some Russians are looking for you.

980
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:39,520
Oh yeah, you didn't know,

981
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:44,760
now, but you see... Mr. Kim
spent some years in Russia. Yeah!

982
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,000
Studying, right?

983
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:50,360
Don't you think he pulled up
some sick shit over there, too?

984
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:56,000
You sick bastard. Is that why you
gave us this piece of shit?

985
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,320
Can you imagine?

986
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:00,800
If this bastard
started killing girls

987
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,680
in New York City instead of Seoul?

988
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:05,480
How do you think
we could handle it?

989
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:07,400
We can't just pull him out.

990
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:12,640
And you guys... You didn't suspect
one single thing, huh?

991
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:18,000
You got yourself
a serious problem there.

992
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:23,160
You had this guy for 2 years
and you came up with nothing.

993
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:25,600
You couldn't even
keep him on a short leash.

994
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,480
What the hell
are you guys good at?

995
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:35,400
Come on. Hey, stop it! Easy.

996
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:40,520
We're trying to make
a deal here, okay? Thank you.

997
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:47,840
Why is that Pyongyang
can't kill my father

998
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,000
even after they cleaned him out?

999
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:55,880
Everyone called my father a genius
when he was a child.

1000
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:00,480
He is very smart up here.

1001
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:06,240
But you see, I am smarter
than my father.

1002
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,760
You guys want his
banking information?

1003
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,320
It's all in here.

1004
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,040
I will give them to you.

1005
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,160
Okay, good.

1006
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,160
Now we're talking.

1007
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:34,600
And let's talk details later
on our side, not here.

1008
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:42,160
How about we take these off
before we talk further?

1009
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,000
The police are here.

1010
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:17,400
The police? How did they find out?

1011
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:21,440
Isn't it obvious?

1012
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:23,800
We got wiretaps, too.

1013
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,800
Where are you off to now?

1014
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,600
A different warrant, this time.
You see this?

1015
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,400
You're quite photogenic, you know

1016
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,200
Could be an actor.

1017
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:40,840
Perfect for a psycho role.

1018
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:43,920
Yes, sir.

1019
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:45,920
Out of the way!

1020
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:03,080
You still want to continue

1021
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:04,960
covering for him,
as a fellow human?

1022
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:09,280
Gwang-il,

1023
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:10,680
I'm so happy to see you again.

1024
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:13,680
I was depressed because

1025
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,480
I thought I'd never see you.

1026
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,240
You bastard.

1027
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:23,640
Where's that smirk now, huh?

1028
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:27,840
Laugh and smirk
like you did before.

1029
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,440
You bastard, seriously...

1030
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:36,080
You're a tenacious one.

1031
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,200
Have some respect
for your elders, you prick.

1032
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:49,440
Oh yeah, Gwang-il.

1033
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,200
By the way,

1034
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:53,800
I figured it out.

1035
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:59,760
The reason why you shove
weird things into vaginas.

1036
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:03,320
You can't, right?

1037
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:06,520
What?

1038
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:09,000
This.

1039
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:11,680
Jerk...

1040
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:14,280
You wanna die?

1041
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:15,560
So I was right.

1042
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:17,960
I was spot on!

1043
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:20,320
He can't, erectile dysfunction!

1044
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,960
You bastard!

1045
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:26,200
How dare you attack a cop?

1046
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:27,760
You piece of shit.

1047
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:29,800
Goddamn shit.

1048
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:33,320
Buddy.

1049
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:37,600
I told you,
this is not North Korea.

1050
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:42,200
Did I tell you that or not?

1051
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:44,800
Give it up, all of you.

1052
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,400
If you try to intercept again,

1053
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:49,880
I'll toss you in for
harboring a killer. Got that?

1054
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:54,360
Take him.

1055
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,960
Get the hell up.

1056
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:00,480
Don't be a pussy.

1057
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,880
Wow, that's Chae Yi-do?

1058
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:14,640
He doesn't waste any time,
does he?

1059
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:20,680
What's the matter with you?

1060
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:22,880
You're not gonna go after him?

1061
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,560
But do you know where Chae Yi-do
keeps getting

1062
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:31,240
all this information from? Here.

1063
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:36,880
And you guys, you
knew about it, huh?

1064
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:43,800
Because the piece of shit that
you picked up... He ratted, right?

1065
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:48,840
Oh yeah...

1066
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,680
Well, Lee Dae-beom,
he used to work for...

1067
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:57,120
Was it called
Foreign Operations Bureau 35?

1068
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:59,720
Before he got transferred to
the Police Department

1069
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,800
up in Northern Pyeongan.

1070
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:06,840
Now, 3 years ago while Lee was
cracking down on Kim and his gang,

1071
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:11,120
Lee got fired, he and his team got
kicked out from the police force,

1072
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:15,520
and sent to a fertilizer
plant to work their asses off.

1073
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:20,280
Now, Kim's gang followed,
they killed all of Lee's men.

1074
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:36,840
You see, to Kim Gwang-il,

1075
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:41,760
Lee Dae-beom is
the North Korean Chae Yi-do.

1076
01:30:58,240 --> 01:30:59,520
Come on, this isn't right.

1077
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:03,440
Out of the way!

1078
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:07,680
Shutting down the task force?

1079
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:10,280
Without consulting me?
By whose orders?

1080
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:14,880
The case is closed,
what's wrong with that?

1081
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,720
It's far from over! Shit!

1082
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:20,480
Alright, fine.

1083
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:21,800
If this is how you want to play,

1084
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:23,400
I'll take him to the HQ.

1085
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:25,160
Get it together, you idiot.

1086
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:28,120
You can't will
yourself through this.

1087
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:31,160
Hand him over
before shit hits the fan.

1088
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:32,840
What shit?

1089
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:35,040
We got new evidence!

1090
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,600
How could you say that
after watching it?

1091
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,040
Have you all gone mad?

1092
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:41,760
Goddammit...

1093
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,120
Why're you going nuts
over a closed case?

1094
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:46,760
Wasn't this a done deal?

1095
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,480
The matter's been settled
with them, too!

1096
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:53,320
If we continue, we'd be
backstabbing the Intelligence!

1097
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:55,440
Yi-do, listen...

1098
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:59,040
The serial killing case is over.
Cased closed!

1099
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:00,800
We got the killer.

1100
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:02,840
I mean, you did with your team.

1101
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:04,640
There won't be any more victims.

1102
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:08,360
Even the Hong Kong cops
swept it under the rug.

1103
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:11,400
So why bring it out
and cause a stink?

1104
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:13,800
What about Det. Jo?

1105
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:18,360
For what did that idiot
kill himself then, huh?

1106
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:22,680
You're the one who put
an incompetent idiot on spotlight.

1107
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:24,800
You wanted the killer!

1108
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,480
You told me
to bring in the killer,

1109
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:28,160
by any means necessary!

1110
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:31,560
Kim is the goddamn killer!

1111
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:33,320
You know that, bastard!

1112
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,080
You bastard...

1113
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:00,960
Hand the key and phone in,

1114
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:02,240
and head back with the boys.

1115
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:05,000
What? Chief, what'll you do?

1116
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:06,920
We'll come with you.

1117
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:10,320
Shut the hell up,

1118
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:11,800
you're all useless idiots.

1119
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:14,440
Give me the key and phone,
and beat it.

1120
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:16,240
- Come on, Chief.
- Now.

1121
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:25,600
Chief...

1122
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:36,040
Good job today, so be on your way!

1123
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:04,760
Things aren't working out
as you had hoped?

1124
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:06,960
Shut your goddamn hole.

1125
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:12,240
You have to know your limits,
otherwise life gets tiring.

1126
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:16,080
District Attorney,
it's Chae Yi-do.

1127
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:19,160
Are you filled in?

1128
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:20,640
I'll head over now, then.

1129
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:24,240
What?

1130
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:27,960
You see, I was given an order
not to get tangled up.

1131
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:32,760
You know my situation,
we're just a third-party.

1132
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:37,840
It'll look like we interfered
a done deal, right?

1133
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,040
So,

1134
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:43,720
drop us from this case.

1135
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:48,000
I heard you're suspended,
you should take it easy.

1136
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,280
This is no small business.
You can't do this alone.

1137
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:52,560
It could be the end for you.

1138
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:12,120
So what?

1139
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:15,680
Arrest me for violating
the National Security Law?

1140
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:21,960
Go on, then.

1141
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:27,680
No.

1142
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:31,040
I don't really feel like it.

1143
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:38,040
Besides, Lee's status is
defector anyway.

1144
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:43,480
He defected after
the incident 3 years ago.

1145
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:47,640
He's been hunting down that
psycho all along.

1146
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:53,760
I guess he wanted to
return to post with Kim.

1147
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:01,240
The agency had a hand
in Kim's defection.

1148
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:04,840
He couldn't move in while Kim
was under our protection.

1149
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,280
So instead, Lee tipped
various agencies,

1150
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:10,680
just enough to corner Kim.

1151
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:15,440
He's a former spy,
that's his specialty.

1152
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:17,920
And? So?

1153
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:20,760
What will you do with him?

1154
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:25,400
I know for a fact, he won't stop
until he drops dead.

1155
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:26,880
He'll keep killing.

1156
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:38,920
If I let the bastard go,
I'm going to regret it.

1157
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:51,120
That's enough.

1158
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:53,920
It's out of our hands now.

1159
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:56,880
The Americans will
take him away, somewhere.

1160
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:00,040
What, people don't live there?

1161
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:05,120
It's their problem now.

1162
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:22,000
So that
North Korean spy was right.

1163
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:17,560
I need to take that out, too.

1164
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:38,760
Hey, Chae Yi-do!

1165
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:51,160
Stop the bleeding
and call an ambulance!

1166
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:21,440
What the hell is wrong with you?

1167
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:26,520
What the hell are you laughing at?

1168
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:26,840
Jerk...

1169
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,320
Goddamnit!

1170
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:35,760
You bastard!

1171
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,680
It's been a while, Kim Gwang-il.

1172
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:02,560
Lee Dae-beom!

1173
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,640
You didn't close down the piers.

1174
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:32,040
Well, I guess it'll do no favor
to us to have him back.

1175
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:34,840
Good job, let them take him.

1176
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,920
Yes, sir.

1177
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:41,840
In any case, it's over.

1178
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:44,840
We clearly handed him
over to the CIA,

1179
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:47,240
and they blew it while
he was under their custody.

1180
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,160
They can't say shit to us.

1181
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:57,280
So... He's Lee Dae-beom,
from Bureau 35, is he?

1182
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:48,920
Too bad for him.

1183
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:55,880
Finally on his way home, after a
ghost life to catch Kim, but...

1184
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,840
...the supreme leader is dead.

1185
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:11,400
Now, Kim Gwang-il's cohorts
are in control of the country.

1186
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:16,280
They wiped out Bureau 35

1187
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:18,760
and Jang Sung-taek is in charge.

1188
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:25,640
Kim Mo-sul has been
reinstated, of course.

1189
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:33,920
(5. Epilogue)

1190
01:52:56,160 --> 01:52:57,560
Very good.

1191
01:52:59,120 --> 01:53:02,400
Agent Park, it's been a while.

1192
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:09,880
So, is South Korea handling
my case again?

1193
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:14,160
Tell the Yankees,

1194
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:17,520
I'm different this time.

1195
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:29,560
Sure, I bet.

1196
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:36,040
Your father Kim Mo-sul was
executed with Jang Sung-taek,

1197
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:41,520
and you'll be, too,
if you're sent back.

1198
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:46,280
You're in no position to
play with us both again.

1199
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:48,920
I know that.

1200
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:51,680
So what?

1201
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:56,640
Isn't it obvious?
I'll spill the beans.

1202
01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:01,560
I'll tell them everything I know.

1203
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:06,320
The Pyongyang account in China.

1204
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:21,560
Does it hurt?

1205
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:25,600
Listen, Agent Park!
What are you doing?

1206
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:28,320
It's your duty to serve me!

1207
01:54:32,680 --> 01:54:36,000
I asked you a question,
does it hurt?

1208
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:39,520
Park, you damned bastard...

1209
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:03,840
Why are you doing this?

1210
01:55:05,200 --> 01:55:07,040
You can't do this to me.

1211
01:55:09,160 --> 01:55:10,640
Why not?

1212
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:17,040
Agent Park, have you gone mad?

1213
01:55:17,320 --> 01:55:19,240
You... You...

1214
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:23,360
Do you know what you just did?

1215
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:32,800
I told you, I'll give you
everything I know!

1216
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:38,480
I don't need your shit.

1217
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:47,640
You cockroach, how dare you...

1218
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:51,720
...Paul Gray.

1219
01:55:52,600 --> 01:55:54,440
Bring me Agent Gray.

1220
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:57,280
I'm only wasting my time with you!

1221
01:55:58,200 --> 01:55:59,880
Get me Gray!

1222
01:56:09,320 --> 01:56:12,520
Then what? What!

1223
01:56:13,240 --> 01:56:14,880
What do you want?

1224
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:17,240
Tell me what you want!

1225
01:56:21,240 --> 01:56:22,640
Die.

1226
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:26,680
What?

1227
01:56:29,120 --> 01:56:31,080
Die.

1228
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:05,640
Die, bastard.

1229
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:57,120
The thing you wanted.

1230
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:02,640
Yeah?

1231
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:21,560
What the hell have you done? Huh?

1232
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:23,480
Oh jeez...

1233
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:27,120
You must know that China is
pissed off at Kim Jong-un

1234
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:28,480
for killing Jang Sung-taek.

1235
01:59:30,440 --> 01:59:31,360
Do you really think

1236
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:34,360
they will let the North Koreans
access the money

1237
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:35,920
from Jang's Chinese account?

1238
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:41,640
An empty can, you idiot.

1239
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:45,400
The Chinese cleaned it all out.

1240
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:53,720
Seriously, you guys didn't know?

1241
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:56,760
How can you not suspect a thing?

1242
01:59:57,640 --> 02:00:01,080
Isn't that something you should be
concerned about? Huh?

1243
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:10,280
From now on,

1244
02:00:10,640 --> 02:00:12,040
you deal with your own shit.

1245
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:14,560
Don't call for help.

1246
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:18,400
You guys don't sign my checks.

1247
02:00:23,160 --> 02:00:24,800
And the next time I see you,

1248
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:27,960
I promise,

1249
02:00:28,440 --> 02:00:29,960
I will snap your neck.

1250
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:32,720
Yeah...

1251
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:53,240
Get this shit out of here, now!

1252
02:02:55,880 --> 02:02:59,680
(V.I.P.)

1253
02:03:01,400 --> 02:03:04,440
