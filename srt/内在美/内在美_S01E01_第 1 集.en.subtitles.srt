1
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,249
"EPISODE 1"

2
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,297
Do I really have to go?

3
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,299
Why? What's the matter?

4
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,968
I mean, the director could
accept the award instead of me.

5
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,554
Why would he do that for you?

6
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,682
You ran away once a month
until the end of filming.

7
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,851
You're lucky he did not sue you.

8
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,729
-Then, what about you?
-Nonsense.

9
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,898
Do you know how much money you can make

10
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,275
by just making an appearance
and having a photo taken?

11
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,612
I am just a commodity.

12
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,865
Don't try to buy my sympathy.

13
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,618
I have seen this many times...

14
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,621
since high school.

15
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,042
Don't forget, you are only getting
the award because you are showing up.

16
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:09,379
That's not true. I'm getting the award
because I'm a good actress.

17
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,172
Get it straight.

18
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,926
I just... feel strange.

19
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,261
Is today that day?

20
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,888
Isn't it one week from now? No?

21
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,516
You are right, so look ahead.
You will cause an accident.

22
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,892
-Wha...
-Green light.

23
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,477
Jeez, you scared me.

24
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,259
2018 White Bear Film Awards,
Best Female Lead.

25
00:02:56,342 --> 00:03:00,054
The winner will be announced
by last year's winner, Kang So-ra.

26
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,223
Hello, I am Kang So-ra.

27
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,392
I will annouce the winner.

28
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,478
The 2018 Best Actress award goes to...

29
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,231
I'm nervous, too.

30
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,232
HAN SE-GYE

31
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,944
Han Se-gye in Looking For Your Earth.
Congratulations!

32
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,913
In Looking For Your Earth,
Han Se-gye played Mi-ae in her 30s

33
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,666
who lost her lover in an accident
and became anti-social.

34
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,086
Her delicate and emotional acting
and realistic character have been

35
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,881
praised for establishing
a female character

36
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:38,134
unmatched in Korean cinema history.

37
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,736
Se-gye!

38
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,781
Se-gye!

39
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:57,857
Are you okay?

40
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,953
Damn it. I left my shoe.

41
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,748
That was a limited edition!

42
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,128
I left my shoe. Oh, my god!

43
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,299
-I am so mad!
-Your gown will rip. Calm down.

44
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,931
I am so furious!

45
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,975
-Stop, you will rip your dress.
-What am I going to do now?

46
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,772
I was 20 years old
the first time it happened.

47
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,900
It happened during the trip
with U-mi to Europe.

48
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,635
I thought I was dreaming.

49
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:17,520
I thought I would wake up
if someone called my name.

50
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,111
But the body of woman who aged overnight

51
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,864
was not a dream.

52
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,345
That was the first day of hell.

53
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,265
My last memory is seeing a man...

54
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,102
his shirt was soaked with blood.

55
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,272
Maybe I have been...

56
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,734
paying for what happened that day.

57
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,826
Entertainment Inside always brings you
hot news.

58
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,745
We will begin now.

59
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,830
We have shocking news.

60
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,040
It was last week.

61
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,625
During the best actress award ceremony,

62
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:24,003
Han Se-gye suddenly ran out.

63
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,048
All week her agency will only say

64
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,717
that it is still confirming what happened.

65
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,802
Mr. Kim, what do you think?

66
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:36,807
She ran away again! It is amazing.

67
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,435
Some say, not the best actress...

68
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:43,439
-My shoe?
-It is too embarrassing to ask for it.

69
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:52,156
She is also known for keeping men
on their toes.

70
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,992
She dates many men,

71
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,911
regardless of race and age.

72
00:08:56,994 --> 00:09:00,164
Is she going to run away from men, too?

73
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,832
It's very likely.

74
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,044
She ran away in the middle
of an awards ceremony

75
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,172
so running away from a date
should be easy.

76
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,973
Did you see? What is he saying?
So funny!

77
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,643
How can I run away when I don't date?

78
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,479
How can I date when I'm like this?

79
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,694
What am I going to do?

80
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,072
I need to retire.

81
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,325
This again!

82
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,286
Stop saying that.

83
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,003
Han Se-gye is...

84
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,006
-Do you have money?
-What money?

85
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,383
Do you need money? How much?

86
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,553
You will need money
if you're retiring.

87
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,889
Don't worry about money.

88
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:04,270
She'll have none after paying
her breach of contract anyways.

89
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:10,693
-Sell this house. Maybe you'll be okay.
-It might be about one billion won.

90
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,779
-How much do you have in the bank?
-Hey, Ryu Eun-ho.

91
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,199
Are you doing some kind of ritual
to curse me?

92
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,909
What are you talking about?

93
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,746
I'm going to priest school.
I don't do such things.

94
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,790
Then, go now to the Lord

95
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,084
and ask why he is doing this to me.

96
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,794
I'm just worried.

97
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:32,340
You shouldn't make a rash decision
without a concrete plan for the future.

98
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:37,094
Why do I keep him around?
Do you want to go to the Lord right now?

99
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,137
Don't be mad.

100
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,266
A rumor has been spreading
that she has hidden a son.

101
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,269
So we prepared this.

102
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:49,440
This is an Entertainment Inside exclusive.
Take a look.

103
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,524
HAN SE-GYE'S HIDDEN SON

104
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,568
The video was taken

105
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,530
when Han Se-gye disappeared for a week
during the film's shooting.

106
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,531
At that time...

107
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,867
That was two months ago, right?

108
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,161
That's right.

109
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,373
When she became a kid two months ago.

110
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,589
One, two, three, four, five.

111
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,471
Good news and bad news.
Which one do you want to hear first?

112
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,431
The bad news.

113
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,601
You just lost 13 commercials.

114
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:30,439
Was I booked for that many?
I am so popular.

115
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,358
And the good news?

116
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:38,155
We were just offered two new commercials.

117
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,615
Baby formula and diapers.

118
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,910
I will go and check my bank balance.

119
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,955
Hold on. This isn't bad.

120
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:50,876
This is a company that makes stuff
for kids with rare diseases...

121
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,339
I'll go home and farm with my mom.

122
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,884
I will walk Gging-ggang
and live like an ancient scholar.

123
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,012
You know how much
farms cost these days?

124
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,056
Now we will move on
to the Hollywood stars.

125
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:09,645
Brad Pitt recently said
he has prosopagnosia.

126
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,106
Hey, Se-gye!

127
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,843
FUN AND COMFORTABLE FLYING

128
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,138
It won't be easy
to terminate the contract  immediately,

129
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,849
as Se-gye is not reachable.

130
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,392
What should we eat for lunch?

131
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,144
Are you listening?

132
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,730
Army soup or beef soup?
Which one do you like?

133
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,065
If we lose codeshare rights,
we'll lose our jobs, too.

134
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,027
CODESHARE: AIRLINERS' CO-OPERATION ON
ROUTES BY SELLING THE SEATS TOGETHER

135
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,695
Then we will have no money for lunch.

136
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,198
I like army soup, but the smell gets
into my clothes.

137
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,992
Sir, this is a big problem.

138
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,203
The CEOs are already talking.

139
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,288
This is a big deal for you,
but not for me.

140
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:12,041
I'm the son of the owner's family.
What are they gonna do?

141
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,418
Will they kick me out of the house?

142
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,879
This is not a time
for you to talk like a kid.

143
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:21,801
Well...

144
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,929
I think I will lose my appetite
before lunch.

145
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,975
-Like this...
-Yes.

146
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,730
This problem with Han Se-gye
might be a good thing for us.

147
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,441
He pushed this campaign
in the strategic planning meeting.

148
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,319
He can't read people.

149
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,031
How will he do business?

150
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:49,537
He just doesn't have a business mind,
don't you think?

151
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,248
That's why people were complaining
in the last stockholders' meeting.

152
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,334
People say Seo is not seasoned enough
to lead the company,

153
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,418
unlike you.

154
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:00,339
Mr. Seo might be the son of the owner,
but he's no match for your skills.

155
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:04,885
Isn't that why the Chairman
is watching him so closely?

156
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,972
And he is arrogant.

157
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,850
He makes busy people like me
drop everything to come and go.

158
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,272
He just needs to do his job.

159
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,982
Hello, Mr. Seo.

160
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:24,321
In the middle is CEO Kim Hong-woo,
on the left is director Beak Sang-hyun.

161
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,323
On the right is director Sung Ho-seok.

162
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,786
Hello!

163
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,383
It's been a while!

164
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,551
-Director...
-Right side.

165
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,429
Kim.

166
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,889
Oh, yes.

167
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,017
Are you well?

168
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,102
Looks like you have been
working out quite a bit.

169
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,104
You look so young,
I almost didn't recognize you.

170
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,814
Don't give me that.

171
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,527
Due to the trouble that you caused,

172
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,113
I am aging rapidly every day.

173
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,866
The airplane we bought has a problem.

174
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,286
We were supposed to perform maintenance
and use it before the end of the month.

175
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:24,798
But it is likely to be delayed
due to the Strategic Planning Department.

176
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:29,929
It looks like this issue will be referred
to the Chairman level.

177
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,431
If this harms codeshare,

178
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,100
people in the company will raise
an issue, too.

179
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,063
You are probably right.

180
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,481
So, if it comes to that,

181
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,650
your Strategic Planning  team
should take full responsibility--

182
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,777
In any case,
beef soup is certainly better.

183
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,988
Army soup can wait until the weekend.

184
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,616
It smells bad.

185
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,203
Taking the smell out will take time.

186
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,373
-Excuse me?
-You think now is the time for a joke?

187
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,084
Talking about food in this situation?

188
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,335
Do you have an appetite?

189
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,170
Did you not eat lunch yet?

190
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,714
It seems you haven't,
as you are so cranky.

191
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,221
Go and have lunch.

192
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,349
Eat something that does not have
a strong smell.

193
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,185
It is rude to have
too strong an odor.

194
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,230
-Mr. Seo!
-Right!

195
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,440
After lunch, buy a plane with my card.

196
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,611
It's my personal card,
so there should be no problem.

197
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,364
There's no limit on this card.

198
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:34,493
Now, I'll need to go and eat beef soup.

199
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,294
What a character!

200
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,132
I can only pressure them with money.
I've got nothing else.

201
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,968
Was it too cheap?

202
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,554
You have more than money.

203
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:57,016
Education, looks, character, et cetra.

204
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,893
Let's move looks to the beginning.

205
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,520
I like it the most.

206
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,823
Nice to see you here, Mr. Seo.

207
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,162
I didn't know you were into
this kind of thing.

208
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,663
What is this?

209
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,374
You're looking at a hard-working
representative.

210
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,462
Is T-Road's director doing his work
as a hobby?

211
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,923
Take it easy.
Looks like you are about to eat me.

212
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,426
That sounds scary.

213
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,345
If you eat just anything
because you're hungry, you get sick.

214
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,890
Why are you getting meaner
as you get older?

215
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,100
Don't you think I'm cute when I'm mean?

216
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,196
Before you change the route,
you should change your model.

217
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,323
Grandpa was furious.

218
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,577
But I always welcome your mistakes.

219
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,081
You know, grandpa doesn't side with you
just because you're his bloodline.

220
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:03,665
Of course, I do.

221
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,293
That's how you became the president
of the company.

222
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,420
My grandpa is too stylish.

223
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,672
Even though it's a just a low-fare
airline company,

224
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,799
how did he give it to you?

225
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,593
Brother, please don't get sick.

226
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,720
If you get sick,
that means more work for me.

227
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,138
I already have enough.

228
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,224
OK. You look exhausted.

229
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,725
You should take a break.

230
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,727
Tell me any time you need a break.

231
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,605
Taking your role will be
a piece of cake for me.

232
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,448
I'll go. Take it easy.

233
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,708
You think I'm crazy?

234
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,752
I am not taking it easy for you!

235
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,337
-Hello!
-Hello!

236
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,923
You are flying to Jeju, correct?

237
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:57,719
The departure time is 1:00 p.m. at Gate 7.
Please go over there.

238
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,388
Have a safe flight!

239
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,271
I'm surrounded in a jungle.

240
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,731
The one in front of me is dying to eat me.

241
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,359
The one behind me is dying to chase me.

242
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,279
Your flight takes off at 1 p.m. at Gate 7.

243
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,697
Please go upstairs.

244
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,576
What do you think I should do?

245
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:25,164
Find Han Se-gye, wherever she is.

246
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,374
Find her and have her take responsibility.

247
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,718
She must be hiding
to wait for better times.

248
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,137
How naive!

249
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:47,060
SEODONG HOSPITAL

250
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,604
Alright!

251
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,816
You look so pretty.
That is good, very good!

252
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,948
A little more. Pose.

253
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,034
One, two, three!
OK!

254
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,537
OK, now let's get a close-up.

255
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,705
One, two...

256
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,541
A little more.

257
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,710
More, more...

258
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,921
Should I look even more sad?
How much more?

259
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,422
Well...

260
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:18,508
Wipe off your lipstick.
You look too lively.

261
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,801
OK, that's it!

262
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,430
Let's go! It looks nice!

263
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,058
-Good.
-Oh it is good.

264
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,435
You can say whatever you want,
but don't say you have a kid.

265
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,439
While your capable agent takes care
of the situation,

266
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,024
You pretend to be sick here.

267
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,029
Wouldn't it be better to buy farmland?

268
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:40,697
You like famine relief food.

269
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,659
I will take classes from a cyber college.
Let's go and farm together.

270
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,413
OK, then, I will...

271
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,750
think of the character I did
when I go and see a doctor.

272
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,211
-No, she was a manic!
-That's what I'm saying!

273
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,212
I will kill you!

274
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,923
Take the examination seriously.

275
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,259
You change even before the date.

276
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,594
I am worried if you have other problems.

277
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:06,139
Oh agent U, I love you!

278
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,766
-Agent U...
-No thanks!

279
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:13,063
-Bye!
-OK.

280
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,904
SECRETARY JEONG JU-HWAN

281
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,659
What's up?

282
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:28,370
-I found where Han Se-gye is.
-Where is she?

283
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,419
Working hard is good,
but health should come first.

284
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,838
If you lose your health,
you lose everything.

285
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,257
You take care of your health.

286
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,383
She is in the hospital.

287
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:45,679
SEODONG HOSPITAL

288
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,389
It is Seodong Hospital.

289
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,144
I'm heading there.

290
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,187
I'll go there first, so you come, too.

291
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,276
Aren't you gonna wait for me?

292
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,444
Do you think I'm a kid?

293
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,446
I should get her before she runs off.

294
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,114
She likes to run away.

295
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,496
How dare you put your hands on me?

296
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,999
Let me go. Right now!

297
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,918
You bitches!

298
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,547
I belong to his majesty!
I am a Lord's woman!

299
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,966
Lord! Lord!

300
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:26,928
She is pretty!

301
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,559
Look at her face.

302
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,644
Lord, it is me, Ok-jeong.

303
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,980
Her acting is good.

304
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,609
She should be good.
That character really fits her.

305
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:45,113
-People say she's completely insane.
-Really?

306
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,829
Do you want to kill me?
Go ahead!

307
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,957
I won't disappear even after my death.

308
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,919
I will be an evil ghost
and stay in this world.

309
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:03,590
I will haunt you and everyone around you.

310
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,645
Just die.
See? She dies.

311
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,689
-Is that funny?
-Then, should I cry?

312
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:21,483
Jeez.

313
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,194
She might be really sick.

314
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,407
That is not true.
Han Se-gye is just faking.

315
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,868
By the way, she hasn't had
any plastic surgery.

316
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:35,664
-I saw her picture and found nothing.
-I thought so.

317
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,582
Even these are natural.

318
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:41,378
Oh my... That is sexual harassment.

319
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,088
No, it is not!

320
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,465
You went too far!

321
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,051
It was just a joke.
Don't take it so seriously.

322
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,679
If no one laughs, it is not a joke.

323
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:54,224
Oh... OK. I got it.
I'm sorry.

324
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,770
I guess you all like Han Se-gye.
She even has a kid.

325
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:01,773
It seems obvious how she behaved.

326
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,527
-What do you know?
-Her face says everything.

327
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:08,321
By the way, do you know who the father
of her kid is?

328
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,365
-Who? Do you know?
-I don't.

329
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,659
She might've adopted him.
How would I know?

330
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,870
-Stop it.
-It is none of my business.

331
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:22,752
What was that?

332
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,632
What was that?

333
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:32,345
Oh, I threw the tangerine for a joke.
Why aren't you laughing?

334
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,390
Why do you care if I got
plastic surgery or not?

335
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:39,227
It is you who needs surgery,
especially here.

336
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,234
Is this woman crazy? This is a hospital.

337
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,988
I am crazy, man! How would I not go crazy
in this situation?

338
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,245
This situation? What situation?

339
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,207
The situation where you hide
from your trouble?

340
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,044
Shame on you.

341
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:07,589
Wake up. No one here likes you.

342
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,925
Not just here. Step outside!

343
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:13,261
Everyone bad mouths you.
Why are you just picking on me?

344
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,764
Wh...What?

345
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,475
You are raising a kid and you don't
even know who the father is.

346
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:19,392
What?

347
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,395
-Oh, dear.
-I heard that, too.

348
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:25,357
Let's not talk to each other.
I am not that low.

349
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:26,691
What a day!

350
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,791
That's not it. It's not true!

351
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,256
-Stop!
-It's not true.

352
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,967
I said it is not true!

353
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,053
It is not true, just not true!

354
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,306
She's scary. Let's get out of here.

355
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,189
Hi, U-mi.

356
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,693
Buy some tangerines on your way.
I need the biggest ones.

357
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,280
-What is the room number?
-It's 1005.

358
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,575
And bring them to the lady in Room 1005.

359
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,370
No... I just borrowed her tangerines.

360
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:33,758
What did I do so wrong?
What did I do?

361
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,513
I am just living my life.
What do they want from me?

362
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,724
What do they want?

363
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,434
HAN SE-GYE

364
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,401
FROM: MOM

365
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,697
You are embarrassing me.
I can't live in this town.

366
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,116
That's why I live far away from you.

367
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,744
What is it that's so hard
that you run away?

368
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,579
I knew it when you were little.

369
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,624
You even ran away not to go
to kindergarten.

370
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:06,916
You're still the same.

371
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,835
What do you know?

372
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,754
What do you know?

373
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,256
Is that how you talk to your mom?

374
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,511
Who will I blame? I'm your mother.

375
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,139
That's right. You cannot blame anyone.
Your daughter is like this.

376
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,516
Are you in the hospital?
Should I go there?

377
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,436
-Never mind. Just hang up.
-Still...

378
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,316
You really don't know anything.

379
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,156
Are you sure she's here?

380
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,844
She's not here.
Han Se-gye already ran away.

381
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:06,935
Shouldn't we search her in the club,
not in the hospital?

382
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,562
Or a hotel. You said she dates many men.

383
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:13,775
Find out who she is meeting with.
Put a guard in front of his house.

384
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,867
-Was I too loud?
-Huh?

385
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:26,955
I wonder if I was too loud to disturb
someone while she's sad.

386
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,375
OK, speak.

387
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:35,046
I leaked to the shareholders and partners
about terminating her model contract.

388
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,173
Publish it to the media, too.

389
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:41,136
We have to make it clear,
so that Han Se-gye can't control us.

390
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:56,317
Jeong, do you know... sign language?

391
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:57,944
Sign language?

392
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:02,198
She is using her fingers
like this and that. What does that mean?

393
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:05,201
Never mind.

394
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,704
You said she has a kid.

395
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,665
Check kids' places around her house.

396
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,543
Search kids' cafes, day cares,
and places like that.

397
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,629
Even though she does what she wants,
she wouldn't abandon her own kid.

398
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,298
Excuse me!

399
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,010
It is OK. You can have it.

400
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,724
Do you think this is right?

401
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,394
Do you know me?

402
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,815
Pardon me, but what is your name?

403
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,026
I forget things.

404
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,695
Wow, now what is this?

405
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,614
You are screwing me up in many ways.

406
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,908
I think there's a misunderstanding.

407
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:48,411
Those who hurt others forget
and those who get hurt remember forever.

408
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:52,207
OK. I like saying things to one's face,
not taking behind their back.

409
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,295
Excuse me. But are you nuts?

410
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,839
Is that why you're hospitalized?

411
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,549
I sure am crazy.

412
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,718
I'll take this
as a token of your apology.

413
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,725
I'll pay for it,
so bill me for the phone on paper.

414
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,310
That's my apology.

415
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,489
WOMAN I MET AT THE HOSPITAL
WEARING A GOWN

416
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,707
HANDKERCHIEF
MAYBE HOSPITALIZED DUE TO MENTAL ILLNESS

417
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,301
You are not a kid.
How did you lose your phone?

418
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:47,804
I didn't lose it. It was taken away.

419
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,807
-Who did that?
-I don't know.

420
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,517
Of course.

421
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,525
-You're checking on them, right?
-All 12 fish are fine.

422
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,277
Yo-rong gained weight
and Mimi is getting picky with food.

423
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:03,987
Dr. Oh is coming back.

424
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,540
Have him come in. Nothing changes.

425
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,625
Who knows?

426
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,837
Your condition was due to an accident.

427
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,630
Having hope is good.

428
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,425
What happened with the codeshare?

429
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,304
I was about to brief you.

430
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,848
Kyla wants to reconsider.

431
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,894
Because of Han Se-gye? Did you not tell
them we would terminate the contract?

432
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,062
I did and that's the problem.

433
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,525
I LOVE HAN SE-GYE!
I LOVE KOREA!

434
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,152
-I love her!
-I love her!

435
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,572
The owner's daughter is a big fan
of Han Se-gye.

436
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:52,285
It is said that they accepted
the offer because she was the model.

437
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,787
Damn Korean Wave!

438
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,122
What should we do?

439
00:31:56,205 --> 00:32:00,460
It's good. I don't have to spend my time
or money to look for her.

440
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,504
Let's not terminate the contract.

441
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,089
That'll be difficult.

442
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:09,177
She contacted us first to break
the contract.

443
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:12,263
What? Why did she come forward
faster than us?

444
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,063
She leaves me no choice.

445
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,732
I don't really like to do this...

446
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:41,292
"Are you nuts?" How dare he?

447
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,129
You! Han Se-gye!

448
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:49,217
-What have you done?
-Me?

449
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,052
I'm in detention.

450
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,930
Don't you see the nude tone,
the symbol of remorse and detention?

451
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,897
You are so pretty and smart!

452
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,400
What are you doing?
Watch out for my nails!

453
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,901
Give me some money!

454
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,736
Get her off of me!

455
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,115
-Hey, hey!
-You did something really nice.

456
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,784
I'm proud of you, my friend.

457
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,787
A nice thing? Like what?

458
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,163
You mean nude-tone nails?

459
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,040
You made donations!

460
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:25,086
It's not easy,
even for the richest people.

461
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,255
Donation? From me?

462
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,716
-As much as one million won.
-One million won?

463
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,885
No one talks about the kid any more.

464
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,221
Now people say they were the kids
you sponsored.

465
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:39,517
They think you invited them to your place
and took care of them.

466
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,978
-It wasn't me.
-Yes, it was.

467
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,649
-It wasn't me.
-I said it was you.

468
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,026
It's been confirmed.

469
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,572
DAY OF SPONSORING LOW-INCOME YOUTHS

470
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,992
It's really not me. Something is wrong.

471
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,995
Maybe it is from your fans.
You have a lot of them.

472
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,875
They bring us here all the time,
after giving us money.

473
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,253
The picture we'll take today will go
online, right?

474
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:11,424
Strangely, people think
poor kids have no pride.

475
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,926
The old farts will come, too, right?

476
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,720
I dislike it even more.

477
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,520
-You, Han Se-gye!
-Yes, ma'am.

478
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,648
-Please, just do what I say.
-It is not me, really.

479
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:32,945
U-mi, stop for a minute.

480
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,156
Appreciation Award for Han Se-gye.

481
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:38,993
With deep understanding and affection
toward social welfare,

482
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:44,290
you supported low-income
and underprivileged families.

483
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:47,710
We present this award from appreciation.

484
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,546
On September 22nd, 2018.

485
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:54,634
From Jang Jeong-in, the Chair
of Green Welfare Foundation.

486
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,511
Please applaud loudly.

487
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,148
APPRECIATION AWARD

488
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:13,820
The next awardee is President Kim Tae-jin
from Jinju Corporation.

489
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:18,116
Appreciation award to Kim Tae-jin.

490
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,659
The words are the same.

491
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,160
Please applaud loudly.

492
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,416
Thank you for your meaningful donation.

493
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:38,386
Now, we will take a photo of the sponsors
and the beneficiaries together.

494
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:43,182
Officials and beneficiary students,
please come to the front.

495
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,561
Let's go. Go.

496
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,855
-You stand here in the middle.
-No, I'm OK.

497
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:51,065
Why don't you come to the middle?
Like this.

498
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,400
Thank you.

499
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:55,361
This way.

500
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,446
Gather in the middle.

501
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,447
How have you been?

502
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:01,742
-Please look at the middle.
-Se-gye, please look here.

503
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:02,743
Smile.

504
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,288
Ga-young, you grew even more.

505
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,376
Your uniform looks a little too tight.

506
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,420
Now you look like a fully-grown lady.

507
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:15,631
If I bumped into you on the street,
I wouldn't recognize you and ask you out.

508
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,218
Se-gye, please look here.

509
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,845
You could be my girlfriend.

510
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:25,725
My girlfriend is
only 5 years older than you.

511
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,479
Do you want to be my girl?

512
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,565
What?

513
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,111
It's a joke.

514
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,739
To help you smile for the picture.

515
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,622
I guess he really adores you, Ga-young.

516
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:48,831
Good for you.

517
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:53,294
Of course, she is pretty.
She's like a daughter to me.

518
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,549
Damn, I can't take this any more.

519
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,268
I can't take this

520
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,771
because I only allow solo shots.

521
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,942
I just can't do group photos.

522
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,449
It's fine you want to show off.

523
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,912
But isn't it too low
to have the kids stand here like this?

524
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,874
Am I the only one who thinks like this?

525
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,254
Or you just don't want to see it?

526
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,596
And...

527
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,977
Wh...what is it?

528
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,195
What are you doing?

529
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,698
What's the matter?
I did it because you look pretty.

530
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,491
You're like a father to me.

531
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,497
You don't do this to your dad?

532
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:14,166
I am not sure as I don't have a dad.

533
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:20,089
But... you don't do that
to daughters, either.

534
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:25,011
Real dads are careful
and don't touch like that.

535
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:31,183
I don't know why some people dare
to touch girls as they wish.

536
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:39,567
Wh... what the heck? What nonsense!

537
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,402
Don't take a picture!

538
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,737
What did you do that for?

539
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,447
Sir!

540
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:45,823
Sir!

541
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:48,784
Sir!

542
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,202
Come here.

543
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:56,876
-Se-gye, can you talk about this?
-Wait!

544
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,004
It's OK.
We just need to go offline for a while.

545
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,214
You crazy...

546
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,675
No one tried to help!
What should I have done?

547
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:07,845
Those who act dirty
just because they have money

548
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,597
should be harshly punished.

549
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:10,598
You!

550
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:14,894
Sir

551
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,772
You humiliated me.

552
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,149
You make money by smiling
in front of cameras.

553
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,068
Do you know who I am?

554
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:25,571
Let's please talk this out.

555
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,782
You are whatever president
of whatever company, right?

556
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,909
And your name is Tae-jin? SOB-jin?

557
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:31,660
Wh... what?

558
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:35,039
You are lucky that I make money
by smiling in front of cameras.

559
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:38,250
If I were a cop,
you would have been arrested already.

560
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,212
Watch it. I am going to discontinue
all the donations.

561
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:43,756
Go ahead. I'll pay for everything.

562
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,508
How are you going to do that?

563
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:49,011
I will call and stop all the sponsoring.

564
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,056
It is all your fault
if the kids here starve.

565
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:57,520
In this country,
you can buy age and title with money.

566
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,189
In that sense, I have many brothers.

567
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,442
You know nothing about how money works.

568
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,986
You are incredibly cheap.

569
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:07,780
What?

570
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:14,495
You are just--

571
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:20,626
Who on earth are you?

572
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,337
The one who will donate
to this Foundation instead of you.

573
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:24,463
"You?"

574
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,841
Did you just call me "you"?

575
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,635
You said money can buy age and title,
which means I am your senior.

576
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:32,304
-I don't need to speak formally to you.
-What are you?

577
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,723
Where did this young kid...

578
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,478
Oh, I forgot to introduce myself.

579
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:46,026
Hello. I am Seo Do-jae, the team leader of
Strategic Planning Department at T-Road.

580
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,904
Seo Do-jae?

581
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,240
Seo Do-jae...

582
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:53,993
You...

583
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,204
Do you understand now?

584
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,875
Just go home, President Kim Tae-jin
of Jinju Corp.

585
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,220
Thank you.

586
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:14,430
Han Se-gye!

587
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,059
That was impressive.

588
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,771
That crazy bastard at the hospital...

589
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,068
Excuse me for a second.

590
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:47,963
I get it now.

591
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:50,966
It's good to see you.

592
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:53,260
Pay my money back.

593
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,597
MODEL CONTRACT

594
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,144
I'm not going to extend the contract.

595
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,146
That's gonna be a problem.

596
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,273
Your picture was taken with my money.

597
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,654
"Donation angel Han Se-gye
makes exemplary donation"

598
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,697
"I love kids"

599
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,617
"Joy of sharing"

600
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:19,787
This is not it.

601
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,915
Are you threatning me?

602
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,460
Wait, I'm not done threatening.

603
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:30,005
"Han Se-gye's donations were confirmed
to be false.

604
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:33,759
Given that she has made public
appearances in various support events,

605
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,594
this is expected to trigger controversies.

606
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,430
The actual anonymous donor who donated
100 million won said

607
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:44,103
he will not forgive Se-gye for taking
advantage of his good will."

608
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,734
With one finger,

609
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:52,278
this will be delivered.

610
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,280
It's a convenient world, isn't it?

611
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,742
Once again, not extending
the contract will bring trouble.

612
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,786
Not to me, but to you.

613
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:04,623
Do whatever you want.

614
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:09,211
-I'm going to retire, anyway.
-Se-gye!

615
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:12,131
I am not that attached
to the entertainment field.

616
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:15,301
Retirement seems to be the way to go.

617
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,387
If you say so.

618
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:33,569
Sir, please let it go just once.

619
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,614
Why do you kneel down? Get up.

620
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,658
In fact, Se-gye has a sad story.

621
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:43,370
-Just be generous this time--
-Agent U!

622
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:48,834
What should I do?

623
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,461
It's up to you.

624
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,142
Se-gye, you are killing me!

625
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:14,401
That's enough. Get up.

626
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,736
I will sign the contract.

627
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,071
Really?

628
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,908
Yes, I will. I can do it.

629
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,786
Give me the pen
before she changes her mind.

630
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,875
Here, you sign.

631
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,585
Hurry.

632
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:40,427
She signed, so take care of the article.

633
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:41,428
Yes.

634
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:47,935
I think... I accidentally sent the email.

635
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:48,852
-What?
-What?

636
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:51,647
I meant to click the Cancel button,

637
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,817
but I clicked the Send button. Oops.

638
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:57,820
OK.

639
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,196
-OK?
-OK?

640
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,868
FROM JEONG JU-HWAN

641
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:06,787
I deleted it.

642
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,167
I didn't say
where the email was to be be sent.

643
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:15,170
It was supposed to be sent to me.

644
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,551
I'm telling you this as a partner.

645
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:25,222
Check all the details
when you sign a contract.

646
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:27,015
You are a con-artist.

647
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,810
Also, flip the contract over.

648
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:39,778
"You must accompany business trips
when required.

649
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,864
During the trip,

650
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:44,199
you must wear a red dress."

651
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:52,166
That is a crucial part,
so please be aware.

652
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,501
Let's go on a business trip first.

653
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:55,836
Just the two of us.

654
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:00,549
Then I will cut your debt by half.

655
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:04,720
This is fraud.

656
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:06,889
Even if it's a pyramid scheme,
if you get money, do it.

657
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:09,516
You're not even flying to Australia.
It is just Gyeongju. Just do it.

658
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,642
It is 100 million won.

659
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:11,894
Just do what you are asked.

660
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:15,105
-I can pay it back. I have money.
-No, you don't.

661
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,024
If you don't go, we'll have to pay back

662
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,151
all the penalties
for breaching the contract.

663
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,696
He is a pervert.

664
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,031
Why did he tell me what to wear?

665
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,407
He said it's for confidentiality.

666
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,159
It is a top-secret meeting.

667
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:29,369
Isn't it like a serious business drama?

668
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:30,579
You believe that?

669
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:33,415
You are so naive.

670
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,709
Please don't cause trouble. Behave!

671
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,669
Call me if something happens.

672
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,297
I'm worried that I might be
the cause of something.

673
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,758
Pray that I don't fight with the pervert.

674
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,052

KOREA'S ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AT 2%
CORPORATE PROFITABILITY LAGS

677
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:02,069
Hello, sir.

678
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,530
I am the captain of this flight,
Baek Min-seok.

679
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,574
I will do my best to give you
a comfortable flight.

680
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,576
Thank you.

681
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,753
This is the first time I've ever seen
a pilot come to say hi.

682
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,714
Is that so? I'm used to it.

683
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,015
Hey.

684
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:33,392
Go on.

685
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:40,107
-Are you nervous?
-What about?

686
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,777
Is that why you are just reading,
instead of looking at me?

687
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:51,451
Sitting next me...
makes you nervous, right?

688
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,331
Who wouldn't be?

689
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,842
Please do no talk to me.
You are interrupting my reading.

690
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,760
-Excuse me!
-Yes?

691
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:12,764
-I am Han Se-gye.
-I told you not to talk to me.

692
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:13,932
You are interrupting.

693
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:24,776
I knew how bad your temper would be,
'cause even the pilot came out to see you.

694
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:33,368
Oops. The words came out of my mouth.
I meant to speak to myself inside my head.

695
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:02,481
I will carry your bags to your room.

696
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,232
Yes, thank you.

697
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,568
I can take the bags you are carrying, too.

698
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:12,032
Thank you.

699
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:22,000
If you need anything, come to my room.
It's right next to yours.

700
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,585
Why would I need to?

701
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:24,836
You must come.

702
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:28,131
Your luggage is going to my room.

703
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,843
I knew this would happen.

704
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:36,014
I suspected this,
but are you really a pervert?

705
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:38,892
Is that what you wish for?

706
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:39,977
Am I crazy?

707
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,146
Good. I don't want
that kind of misunderstanding.

708
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:45,774
Let's say your luggage is
something like hostages.

709
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:49,528
I need to make sure you will stay here
for the meeting tomorrow.

710
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:51,405
As you have so much fun running away.

711
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:55,325
-Give my luggage back when I speak nicely.
-I won't even if you speak badly.

712
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,787
I will give it back to you
as soon as the meeting is over.

713
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,207
Where are you going?

714
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:05,460
To have fun.

715
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,171
You signed the contract.

716
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,465
I might come back
before the meeting begins.

717
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:13,719
Or not, if I have too much fun.

718
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:16,805
You don't have money.

719
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:18,306
That's none of your business.

720
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,151
So annoying.

721
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:34,364
This is the first time that I had to wire
taxi fees to a driver.

722
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:36,199
What's happening?

723
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,994
Nothing.
I left my wallet in the hotel room.

724
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,913
Don't say a word to U-mi.

725
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:46,501
I wasn't planning to,
but now that you say it, I think I should.

726
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,587
I will pay back double when I get back.

727
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:51,548
-Double?
-Good?

728
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:53,008
Good!

729
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:19,701
Han Se-gye!

730
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:29,336
How did you find me here?

731
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:32,839
Did you have someone follow me?

732
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,341
Stop fooling around and let's go.

733
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:37,427
I think that was enough time for fun.

734
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,471
I asked how you found me.

735
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:44,392
GYEONGJU

736
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,236
DONGGUNG PALACE AND WOLJI POND

737
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,030
Did you search my bag?

738
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:01,326
You have five minutes.

739
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,370
How dare you search my bag?

740
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:05,413
Me? I am your creditor.

741
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:07,833
Don't get confused.

742
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:10,127
I am not here to play with you.

743
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,421
I can break the contract if you want.
Just say the word.

744
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:15,507
I can send the email...

745
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:17,843
to the reporter, even from here.

746
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:25,851
-What's your game?
-You said five minutes.

747
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,353
Count the five minutes.

748
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,867
I was a bit surprised that you are
interested in historical sites.

749
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,619
Even after ages, things like this...

750
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:47,205
stay the same.

751
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,125
I'm envious.

752
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,254
This is reconstructed.

753
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:58,800
But the site is still here. The site is!

754
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:02,429
Are you getting upset with your creditor?

755
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:06,975
Of course not. I raised my voice
because this is so beautiful.

756
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,144
Wow! It is nice and beautiful.

757
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:10,645
It's been five minutes.

758
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,608
Aren't you coming?

759
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,570
I am coming. I am.

760
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:33,460
Why the red dress? It's so uncomfortable.

761
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,212
So that you stand out.

762
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:37,881
I found you immediately.

763
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,926
There aren't many women in red dresses

764
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:42,552
who walk around at night alone.

765
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,555
-It is a shackle.
-You already know.

766
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,435
You seem to like to be sarcastic.
Is that how you became a team leader?

767
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:53,980
You seem to like dramatic situations.
Is that how you became an actress?

768
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:55,690
You are a jerk.

769
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:58,151
-Do you want to get out?
-I would love to.

770
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:19,756
You're really leaving me here?

771
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:22,342
Where am I?

772
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:30,308
Why didn't you just leave me where I was?

773
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,382
NO TAXIS AVAILABLE IN YOUR AREA.

774
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,634
There's not even a taxi.

775
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,851
I'm hungry.

776
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:26,197
I came back to get you.

777
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,451
I thought you would've run out of energy
by now.

778
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:36,833
I can't get up.

779
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:40,295
I am completely out of energy,
thanks to someone.

780
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:01,816
Do you want to eat?

781
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,652
I am hungry.

782
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:10,492
Here it is.

783
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,286
Thank you.

784
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:16,790
You must be sorry.

785
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20,585
It is customary that I treat you a meal
as you came here as a business partner.

786
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:24,631
Please tell me if you plan
to run away again.

787
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:26,716
Then, you will no longer be
my business partner.

788
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,676
I never plan to run away.

789
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,805
It's always ad hoc, extemporaneous,
and improvised.

790
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,977
Maybe you live your life in your fun way.

791
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,897
But I can't do that.

792
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:43,483
I am responsible for lots of things.

793
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:49,114
What... is that supposed to mean?

794
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:53,493
I want you to stop complaining
while we are working.

795
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:54,911
It is not even cute.

796
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:02,419
In my fun way?

797
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:05,505
Of course.

798
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,383
That's how it's seen.

799
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:11,010
Alright.

800
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,138
So what should I do?

801
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:16,266
I should know what to do,
so that I can prepare my acting.

802
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:19,227
Just be yourself.

803
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:21,062
Be a Korean Wave star.

804
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,647
I will do the rest.

805
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:26,443
That's me! A Korean Wave star,
in her fun way.

806
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:28,945
I don't know if she's you.

807
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:32,490
But the person who I want to partner with

808
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:33,408
is she.

809
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:36,077
Got it.

810
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:39,038
I will bring her to the meeting tomorrow.

811
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,462
Can I ask you something as a partner?

812
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:48,923
This is an important question.

813
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:52,135
Do you really have a kid?

814
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:00,935
No.

815
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:04,898
Just for your information,
I am not prejudiced.

816
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,609
Everyone has a story.

817
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:09,903
I said no.

818
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:14,199
I'm just asking because we need
to prepare measures, if you have a kid.

819
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:15,825
I just want to protect you.

820
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,243
Why are you so mean?

821
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,370
I'm just asking you a question,
not being mean.

822
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:21,456
Even if I am mean,

823
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:24,375
there is no reason for me to be kind
to you.

824
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:27,420
I don't recall any good memories
since we met.

825
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,255
I thought you were a good person.

826
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:30,423
Why?

827
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:34,427
I had a good impression of you when
you said you would sponsor the Foundation.

828
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,058
You are not a good person to me.

829
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:46,147
I understand. I am not good, either.

830
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:25,144
How can he say such a thing?

831
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,900
I cannot like him.

832
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,363
He is a jerk.

833
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:45,415
This is unfair. This is not fair!

834
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:48,585
I am not running away for fun!

835
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:52,171
I don't want to run away, either!

836
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,800
I don't want to!

837
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:59,220
Do you hear me? Do you hear me?

838
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:07,103
Jerk! I don't want to, either!

839
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:12,775
The jerk is listening.

840
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:23,661
Thank you.

841
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,167
Thank you.

842
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,220
Your eyes are a bit swollen.

843
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,016
I had ramen before I went to bed.

844
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,006
I AM YOUR FAN

845
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:16,023
DO YOU KNOW KOREAN SIGN LANGUAGE?

846
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:20,570
I LEARNED IT TO SPEAK TO YOU.

847
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:25,199
I HAVE SOMETHING TO GIVE TO YOU

848
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,513
Thank you. It is really touching.

849
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:50,391
DOES SHE LOOK LIKE ME?

850
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:52,769
NO, YOU ARE WAY PRETTIER.

851
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:57,857
YOU ARE PRETTIER.

852
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,275
THANK YOU.

853
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:03,673
Why did you learn sign language?

854
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:07,593
Because I might not be able to speak
someday.

855
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:13,349
Let's say it is for the sake of acting.

856
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:16,811
For the role that might be given to me.

857
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,857
I thought you might not appear.

858
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:24,694
Then, you'd think I ran away.

859
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:28,531
In fact, I do not like running away.

860
01:04:29,907 --> 01:04:31,784
I'm not doing that because I like it.

861
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:33,703
I know.

862
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:40,001
The meeting was successful, thanks to you.

863
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:42,086
I'm thanking you.

864
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:45,047
And I couldn't say--

865
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,799
What will you say?

866
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:49,969
Don't say it. I don't have a kid.

867
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:52,638
I'm sorry.

868
01:04:55,892 --> 01:05:00,104
I was rude at the hospital,
yesterday and all along.

869
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:02,648
There's a story.

870
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:09,488
Now you apologize.

871
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:13,951
I'm sorry, too.

872
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:18,664
For running away, running away...

873
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:22,668
and running away.

874
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:25,963
I have a story, too.

875
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:29,550
I know.

876
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:16,032
Oh my god.

877
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:18,743
What will I do?

878
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:23,539
Passengers, the flight will land shortly.

879
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:26,834
Please return to your seats,

880
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:30,629
and check that your seat belt is fastened.

881
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:35,426
Ma'am, we will land shortly.
You must come out.

882
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:38,220
Is everything OK?

883
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:42,683
Would you open the door
so that we can help?

884
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:44,101
The door won't open?

885
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,146
Are you OK?

886
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:48,314
What's going on?

887
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:50,941
It looks like Ms. Han is in there.

888
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:53,152
But she has not been answering.

889
01:07:53,652 --> 01:07:56,572
Maybe... she fell down?

890
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:00,659
Han Se-gye.

891
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:03,662
Please answer. Han Se-gye.

892
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:12,838
If you don't answer by the time I count
to five, I'll break the door.

893
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:14,215
One.

894
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:15,841
Two.

895
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:17,676
Three.

896
01:08:18,552 --> 01:08:20,137
Four. Five.

897
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:28,938
Han Se-gye...

898
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:32,149
are you OK?

899
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:37,154
Please...

900
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:39,490
Yes?

901
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:49,708
Please help me.

902
01:08:51,418 --> 01:08:53,212
Please cover me.

903
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,177
Bring me a blanket.

904
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:01,095
Yes.

905
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:07,977
Here.

906
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:53,189
There was something strange about her.

907
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:55,274
You have Han Se-gye's voice,

908
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:57,109
and you're wearing the same clothes.

909
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,152
I am discovered.

910
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,154
-What?
-What?

911
01:10:00,237 --> 01:10:03,908
I keep seeing someone who can't be.

912
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:05,242
I am not a mom.

913
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:06,410
I don't have a kid.

914
01:10:06,493 --> 01:10:07,494
Who are you?

915
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:08,996
Who are you?

916
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:12,416
You can't recognize faces, can you?

917
01:10:12,666 --> 01:10:15,544
Stop testing me, Han Se-gye.

918
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:22,968
