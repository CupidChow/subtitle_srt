00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,025
AUNTIE

2
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:14,741
Are you OK?

3
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,409
U-mi told me.

4
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,328
I will explain it to U-mi.

5
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,831
Hello?

6
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,042
Hello!

7
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,394
What are you doing?

8
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,479
Is this true?

9
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,066
Is this true?

10
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,612
You don't recognize faces?

11
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,830
Sorry. I will call you back.

12
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:05,792
What's this?

13
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,796
Proof that you are sick.

14
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,965
Medical records from the accident.

15
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,512
Those have been--

16
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,097
They were taken care of.

17
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,725
Is that important now?

18
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,189
No matter how you use my weakness...

19
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,482
What am I to you?

20
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,366
Why are you making me
a shameless coward?

21
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,577
What are you?

22
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,204
Who are you to go easy on me?

23
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,461
Let's go in and talk.

24
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,564
EPISODE 12

25
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,738
MEDICAL RECORD

26
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,449
SYMPTOMS: PROSOPAGNOSIA
DUE TO TRAFFIC ACCIDENT

27
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:31,586
All those times,

28
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,216
I thought you were
intentionally ignoring me.

29
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,889
But I misunderstood.

30
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,728
I was mad at a sick person...

31
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,106
I recognized you.

32
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,361
Sometimes, I didn't.

33
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,655
But I often recognized you.

34
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,993
You walk straight and erect.

35
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,538
You never have any fear.

36
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,292
You usually get mad at me.

37
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,962
And you have to talk first

38
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,422
to be mad at me.

39
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,843
-The reason I was mad was--
-It's my fault.

40
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,553
I know.

41
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,559
Sorry.

42
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,321
What about Dad?

43
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,742
How did you know he was him?

44
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,328
For Dad...

45
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,414
I didn't...

46
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,293
have to try.

47
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,255
He always called my name first,

48
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,383
and held my hand first.

49
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,469
Even though he didn't know

50
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,472
my condition.

51
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,850
Always.

52
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,441
I'm a bit surprised.

53
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:21,446
I've imagined this situation a lot.

54
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,074
I expected the worst.

55
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,870
I didn't know how you'd talk about it.

56
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,414
How?

57
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:36,419
Just like... you are my real sister.

58
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,763
You are really making me feel shameless.

59
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,079
Tell the truth.

60
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,248
What's there to say? It's...

61
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,167
he was mistaken.

62
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,461
He saw my eyes for sure.

63
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,006
Because it was so dark.

64
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,926
It wasn't too dark to make out faces.

65
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:30,890
OK.

66
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:35,603
You said he wasn't surprised to see you
when you changed, right?

67
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,772
Why is that?

68
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,152
U-mi.

69
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,153
I know.

70
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,949
If you could have told me, you would have.

71
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,079
I don't know.

72
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:57,041
Really, why are you two so lax?

73
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,254
Go to sleep. I will go.

74
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,064
TO: UNCLE

75
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,539
Dr. Oh.

76
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,292
Can the Director's condition worsen?

77
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:43,045
There's no way for it to get worse.

78
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,466
It's not going to be better or worse.

79
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,552
But he's been seeing you for a while--

80
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,262
Prosopagnosia is incurable.

81
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,097
There is no way to cure it.

82
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,016
All I could do was

83
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,561
help Seo Do-jae learn what he has to do.

84
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,438
Like what?

85
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,607
Acceptance.

86
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:07,820
His condition is not going to get
better or worse,

87
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,491
but his life can be better.

88
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,660
What I did was

89
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,330
to help him not kill himself.

90
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,101
Sa-ra found out.

91
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,273
I will resign.

92
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,777
It's my fault.

93
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,820
I'll take responsibility.

94
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,990
My sickness is your responsibility?

95
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,287
I didn't see you as someone who runs
in tough times.

96
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,455
Maybe I was wrong.

97
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,834
How did she find out?

98
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:05,878
The medical record.

99
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,464
Impossible. Medical records--

100
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,966
were destroyed.

101
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,593
But someone found it.

102
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,305
-Could it have been CEO Kim?
-Not sure...

103
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,057
yet.

104
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,352
I will keep my eye on it.

105
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,441
Ju-hwan!

106
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,404
Thank you.

107
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,575
If you are thankful, raise my salary.

108
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,133
I think U-mi figured it out.

109
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,679
I'm so worried that I can't do anything.

110
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,725
I have a girlfriend who worries about me.

111
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:02,643
I like that!

112
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,062
I'm very serious now.

113
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,523
I'm also seriously happy.

114
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,193
Of course, I'm seriously happy, too.

115
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,487
I'm happy, but--

116
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,866
What is she like to you?

117
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,494
What is she like to me?

118
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,544
She... has been next to me.

119
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,547
And will stay next to me.

120
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,341
Forever?

121
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:41,015
If U-mi hates me and runs away,
I will do anything to keep her.

122
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,809
Then I have no other option.

123
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,105
I should beg her, too.

124
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,651
To stay with you forever.

125
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,785
I really don't want to drink.

126
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,371
I don't even want to get close
for a while.

127
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,166
You really got sick, huh?

128
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,920
Hey, you have... a priest...

129
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,096
You are here!

130
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:22,598
What's going on?

131
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,769
I think we'll need a drink.

132
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,870
Sit. What are you doing?

133
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,793
-Drink up!
-Drink!

134
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,336
Bottoms up.

135
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,047
I will pour your glass.

136
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,427
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

137
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,305
That was cool!

138
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,600
So that's what happened.

139
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:11,063
That's why you were such a jerk.

140
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,815
-Hey!
-Why?

141
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,942
Who called him a jerk first?

142
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,696
Was I that much of a jerk?

143
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,282
No, not at all.

144
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,284
It's OK.

145
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:27,246
We would all be like that
in that situation.

146
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:32,585
We would get passive and sensitive.

147
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,837
I understand.

148
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,006
You know that, too!

149
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,842
Se-gye was like that....

150
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,969
so she was so like that!

151
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,346
What do you mean by "so like that"?

152
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,850
So much! You are so...

153
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,395
mean. I'm sure you know it.

154
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,857
Do you want to see real meanness?

155
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,026
Sorry.

156
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:58,944
So far...

157
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,740
I didn't like you. Sorry.

158
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,576
You didn't like me?

159
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,705
Well we weren't exactly fond of you...

160
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,209
How could you be so direct?

161
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,338
You should've told him.

162
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,929
Oh? You must be drunk.
You are laughing!

163
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,264
I'm not drunk. I am just...

164
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,226
happy.

165
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,394
That means you are drunk!

166
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,524
Do you have to work tomorrow?

167
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,275
She does!

168
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,819
But it's OK.

169
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,987
Drink up! 

170
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,405
It's OK?

171
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,365
Hey.

172
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:49,328
You shouldn't stop drinking just because
you'll change your hair a little bit.

173
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,247
You're changing your hair?

174
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,417
She has to shoot a commercial.

175
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,170
Just a little.

176
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,757
It's a small change for us,

177
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,594
but it looks like a big change on camera.

178
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:10,182
Changing hairstyles could confuse you.

179
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,142
Then...

180
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:17,189
should I take a photo and send it to you
whenever she has to change her hair?

181
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,649
-Will that help?
-Yes.

182
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,818
Why would you send a photo to my man?

183
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,073
Oh my, she is such a fool in love.

184
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,577
I didn't know if you would be like that,
you know?

185
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,122
I was really curious...

186
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,293
When you answered her phone before,

187
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,671
why did you have to say
she was washing up?

188
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:41,839
Oh jeez!

189
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:49,221
He seems grown up...
but he doesn't know anything!

190
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,015
That's not true. I know stuff.

191
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:54,226
You do? Are you sure?

192
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,811
So why did you say that--

193
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,272
It's true. I know things!

194
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,773
You do?

195
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:03,193
-Why did you say that--
-I know how to become a parent!

196
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,239
Do you know that, too?

197
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,825
Babies come out from the belly button.

198
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,494
That's how you become a parent.

199
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,371
The belly button...

200
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,375
I don't mind. I'm not prejudiced.

201
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,128
-Eun-ho is a big boy now!
-He is!

202
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,216
Does walking make you feel better?

203
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,969
That's what I wanted to ask you.

204
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,763
Are you sobering up now?

205
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,348
I'm not drunk.

206
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,351
But you smiled so much.

207
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,103
That was because I was happy.

208
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,814
I was happy and amazed.

209
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,652
Thank you for being nice to my friends.

210
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,528
Thank you.

211
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,532
I never thought I'd be able
to do things like that.

212
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,661
I never thought

213
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,664
I would be able to make friends.

214
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,125
It's amazing.

215
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:05,089
I got love, and then friendship.

216
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,802
In fact, they are an item.

217
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,763
Friendship is also love.

218
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,565
There is no dirt on her.

219
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,234
She has no kids.

220
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,195
She has a boyfriend, Seo Do-jae.

221
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,198
You could have found that on the internet.

222
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:37,371
Did you call me this late to tell me that?

223
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,582
-You're not worth the money.
-One thing.

224
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,544
There is one strange thing.

225
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,805
She never entered the bathroom.

226
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,306
She only came out.

227
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,661
What is this? Does this make sense?

228
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,123
Why...

229
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,293
don't we have a mom?

230
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,505
Where did he come from so suddenly?

231
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,718
It could be up to five days off.

232
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,219
It's OK.

233
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,223
Five days off?

234
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,063
HAN SE-GYE, SEO DO-JAE GO ON TRIP

235
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,731
HAN SE-GYE FLEES SHOOT

236
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,608
HAN SE-GYE, SEO DO-JAE FRIENDS.

237
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,319
THEY ARE SEPARATED.

238
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,695
THEY ARE DATING.

239
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,613
SINGLE MOM?

240
00:17:54,573 --> 00:18:00,162
RUNS AWAY AGAIN FROM THE AWARD CEREMONY

241
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,959
Maybe I'm digging too deep
and lost my mind.

242
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,632
No... this makes sense.

243
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,180
-I will be in the office.
-OK.

244
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,266
Hi, senior!

245
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,354
How are you?
I didn't expect to see you here!

246
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,817
See? I told you
we might see each other soon.

247
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,985
Did you come here to do your hair?

248
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,278
I'm doing a reality.

249
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,739
It's a 24-hour observation show.

250
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,742
Oh yeah? I think I've read about it.

251
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,285
Speaking of that,

252
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:45,624
do you remember the boy who suddenly
showed up at the shooting site?

253
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,713
The child actor? Who?

254
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,592
Oh, you probably don't know.

255
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,137
After you disappeared suddenly,

256
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,680
he showed up suddenly!

257
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,766
There was a kid who showed up
instead of you.

258
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,272
Am I a magician?

259
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,816
I disappear and reappear?

260
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,279
I know. It looks like magic.

261
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:20,367
No matter how hard I looked,
I couldn't find a name or a number.

262
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,661
He's my relative.

263
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,914
His name is You Woo-ju. He's ten.

264
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,250
He is not in Korea now. Why?

265
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,626
Want to meet him?

266
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,420
Oh, President You.

267
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,630
Is that possible?

268
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:38,594
He is so cute that I wanted to cast him
on the reality show.

269
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,347
Why is it so loud?

270
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,565
You, over there!

271
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,650
Why do you talk so much?

272
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:01,366
Are you talking about me now?

273
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:03,577
By any chance,

274
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,413
is this your salon?

275
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,874
Even if it is,

276
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,336
you are bothering the customers here.

277
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,007
Don't you know me?

278
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,016
I've never seen you before.

279
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,895
I don't know you. Introduce yourself.

280
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,318
Who is this?

281
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,488
Who is she? Huh?

282
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,115
You guys said only VIPs come here.

283
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,451
-That's why I moved here.
-VIP?

284
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:46,995
Who?

285
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,042
Her?

286
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,129
I sure know who she is.

287
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,929
I will have to go to a different salon.

288
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,808
-Let's go.
-OK.

289
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:14,606
I owe you again.

290
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:19,403
I wasn't trying to help you.
She was really noisy.

291
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,822
Do you come here often?

292
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,284
No, I came here for the first time today.

293
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:29,496
But I won't come back.

294
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,207
It's uncomfortable.

295
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:35,502
Eun-ho...

296
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,339
must be waiting for your call.

297
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,556
Let him wait.

298
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,143
He should...

299
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,854
wait longer.

300
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,070
Se-gye,

301
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,781
did Eun-ho really meet a rich girlfriend?

302
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,408
We don't know yet.

303
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,454
Oh Eu-ho is really...

304
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,622
really capable!

305
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:18,712
NO MESSAGES

306
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,669
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

307
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:05,258
What is this?

308
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,432
I've made up my mind.

309
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,643
I'll let you do what you want.

310
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,231
Today, we celebrate the whole family.

311
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,025
You are newly born today.

312
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,195
You are one year old today.

313
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,239
Call me big sister.

314
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,493
Blow out the candle.

315
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,415
Shall I...

316
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,042
not become a priest?

317
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,794
-What?
-What?

318
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,965
I have to go to work.

319
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,600
Why is he suddenly like that?

320
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,936
I know why!

321
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,814
The Lord listened to my prayer.

322
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,735
I've seen those eyes before.

323
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,781
Those are the eyes when men look at me.

324
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,494
-Ryu Eun-ho
-What?

325
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,417
Does he have a girlfriend?

326
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,795
That is out of the question!

327
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,716
I know those eyes!

328
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,140
Did you see President Kang?

329
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,516
Was everything OK?

330
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,978
I think you are the one who is not OK
with her.

331
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:44,316
Don't say such upsetting words!

332
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,735
I was asking her to do a good job.

333
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:51,615
I was just giving her some gentle
motivation. Don't say it like that!

334
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:55,368
By the way,

335
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:00,415
was she the same?

336
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,501
Is she on the same page as you?

337
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,586
Does it matter?

338
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,963
Taking down Seo Do-jae

339
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,758
and naming her owner
is more important.

340
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,384
And then--

341
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,348
Pros don't need to talk
about what comes next.

342
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,225
I will help.

343
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,023
But...

344
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,860
About Seo Do-jae's weakness...

345
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,119
Share it with me. Will you?

346
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,580
We are pursuing this together.

347
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,332
Are you going to hide it?

348
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,127
You'll find out at the right time.

349
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,174
Sure, there will be a right time.

350
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,972
You changed your hair. Is that for me?

351
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,308
I don't do my hair for other people.

352
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,062
Did you like my present?

353
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:08,191
I'm not sure if it was a present
or a bomb.

354
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,945
It depends on how you use it.

355
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,990
And where I send it.

356
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,076
Did you forget?

357
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,079
You're the one who approached me.

358
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,747
You wanted to take it over.

359
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,710
True. I was like that.

360
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:31,256
I was like that before.

361
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,052
Is this because of him?

362
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,722
Because of that bastard
who came to your place?

363
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:40,807
Are you OK?

364
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:42,851
Excuse me!

365
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,023
It's OK, right?

366
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,525
Go.

367
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,653
What? Not enough?

368
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,448
Let's go. Come here.

369
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,869
Couldn't you tell me you're sorry?

370
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,121
What's there to be sorry for?

371
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,331
Just buy new boots.

372
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:25,894
I guess I did my hair for him.

373
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,358
You guys are pathetic.

374
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,328
Why didn't you call me?

375
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:45,997
You said you would call.

376
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,500
I will call now.

377
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:53,838
I can't go now.

378
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,385
I have to sell all of those.

379
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,354
That's not a problem.

380
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,065
I'll buy them all.

381
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,710
Is this place really OK for you?

382
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,087
Is this place...

383
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:38,091
really OK for you?

384
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,266
Is it OK to bring me
to your favorite place?

385
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:55,734
I just got one step closer
to your personal  boundary, just now.

386
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:59,112
Oh, well...

387
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:04,284
Why did you wipe my boots?

388
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,371
Is your shirt OK?

389
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:14,711
I can wash it.

390
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,130
It won't come off.

391
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,674
Then I'll trash it.

392
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:25,013
Aren't you spending too much on me?

393
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,768
It's OK. I can earn more.

394
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:48,661
Why do you want to be a priest?

395
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:53,792
Just because.

396
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:56,878
Just because?

397
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,757
Why did you want to be cool?

398
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,010
Why did you want to be capable?

399
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,639
That is my answer.

400
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:09,766
Reason?

401
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,893
I don't have one.

402
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,728
It's been my dream

403
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,980
for a long time.

404
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,403
Sounds nice

405
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,323
to have no reason.

406
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:37,252
I always had a reason.

407
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,672
To survive.

408
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,841
To not be looked down on.

409
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,053
All those reasons made

410
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:48,972
me who I am now.

411
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,643
It became a habit.

412
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,401
OK. I understand.

413
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:04,737
I will step back.

414
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,741
I will let the Lord have you.

415
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,204
Why let him have me?

416
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,624
I want to know

417
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:21,796
why my dream has changed you.

418
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,886
You said you liked good people.

419
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,054
Yes.

420
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,142
I'm a bad person.

421
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:35,894
I even lied to you.

422
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:37,770
I know.

423
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:42,275
When a good person and a bad person meet,

424
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,569
what can they do?

425
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,452
Shall we be friends?

426
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,915
Men and women can't be friends.

427
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:20,939
By the way, how come you have
a Joseon white vase in your home?

428
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,616
What? Why are you smiling?

429
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,409
Nothing.

430
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,622
There is something. What is it?

431
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,333
What is it?

432
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,878
If you don't say it,
I'll imagine something crazy.

433
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:48,675
I'll imagine something crazy and cry
into my pillow. Is that what you want?

434
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:51,511
It's because you look like the vase.

435
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:52,887
Look alike?

436
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,474
Me and the vase?

437
00:32:58,601 --> 00:32:59,435
How?

438
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,146
Do I have a round face and stuff?

439
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,316
Kind of.

440
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,151
Listen to him!

441
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,659
You must think of me as you see it.

442
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,495
-Not everyday.
-Not everyday, but very often?

443
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,249
Since when?

444
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,376
Since you first met me?

445
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:30,383
Since I began understanding you.

446
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:32,719
Since I wanted

447
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:37,223
to understand Han Se-gye.

448
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,143
Did you get to understand her?

449
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:41,853
I came to love her.

450
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,650
From the time I was afraid of everything

451
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,986
to the time when I feel fearless.

452
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:52,947
I traveled.

453
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,075
Because you met me.

454
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,827
Because I met you.

455
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:00,705
It's fortunate

456
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,041
that we met.

457
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,627
That day is coming, right?

458
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,797
Oh, you remember!

459
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,718
When that day comes, stay with me all day.

460
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,178
Let's not be apart.

461
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:28,649
Let's go, Ggain-ggang.
Let's go home.

462
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,446
Let's go home.

463
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:36,157
Are you tired?
Oh my goodness!

464
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:37,867
Who are you?

465
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,328
It's me.

466
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,122
You!

467
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,959
Is today that day?

468
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,921
-It's not today!
-What?

469
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,048
Oh...

470
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:56,260
Were you tired?
Why are you like this all of sudden?

471
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,012
Are there other symptoms?

472
00:34:58,805 --> 00:34:59,680
Not really.

473
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,557
Where are you going?

474
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:04,811
Just over there.

475
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,187
To meet Seo Do-jae?

476
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,190
Is he your boyfriend?

477
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,567
Good for you.

478
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:14,570
Someone still calls you Se-gye
with that face.

479
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:21,661
What's wrong? She must be cold.
I will go in first.

480
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:24,372
Come back soon. Don't hang out like that.

481
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,415
Good for you.

482
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,304
THE LITTLE ONE KNOWS NOTHING.

483
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,598
There is your friend.

484
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:53,860
-What's this?
-What's what?

485
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,236
Why did you change?

486
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,362
Did I change?

487
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,410
No, I didn't change.

488
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,829
You... before...

489
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,582
You were...

490
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,503
We have a big problem.

491
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:39,864
Who's this?

492
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,325
Who are you?

493
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,708
Who sent you?

494
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,256
Chae Yu-ri, she has a death wish!

495
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,262
-Calling the police?
-No.

496
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:08,392
It's me. Let's meet.

497
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:17,652
Are you crazy? You had someone follow me?

498
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,112
Do you want to be prosecuted?

499
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,989
If that is the way it has to be,

500
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:25,409
let me understand this
before I go to prison.

501
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,175
Are you my fan?

502
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,469
You have something like this?

503
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,179
Isn't this strange?

504
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:49,684
You didn't go in, but you came out.

505
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:55,564
I watched this from beginning to end.

506
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,609
You didn't go in.

507
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:00,486
You only came out.

508
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,321
Not only that,

509
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:08,369
Your close president calls a strange man
"Se-gye", as if she knows him.

510
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,705
Isn't this strange?

511
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,540
What do you want me to say?

512
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,667
I think you should start talking.

513
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,252
About what?

514
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:17,295
I know.

515
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,881
I didn't know what this is either.

516
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,718
Then, it came to me.

517
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,178
When you sign a contract,

518
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:29,557
you ask to take a week off every month,
correct?

519
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,976
Or,  you just run away.

520
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,732
Is this the secret you've been hiding?

521
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,818
You are insane.

522
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,820
You've seen too many movies.

523
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,657
I don't really watch movies, even the ones
I star in.

524
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:51,203
We will find out in a few days
if I'm crazy or not.

525
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,250
I did some calculations

526
00:38:56,834 --> 00:39:02,340
from the day when the boy popped out
to your disappearance.

527
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,760
Isn't that day coming?

528
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:13,809
Are you scared?

529
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,646
Then, tell me the truth now.

530
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:21,692
Maybe I will let you go
after I listen to you.

531
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,880
Why are you running?

532
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,757
I did not want to waste my time.

533
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,593
Oh, so you admit you are running away.

534
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,553
Who's going to believe that?

535
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,681
Whether they believe it or not, it's true.
You change.

536
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,894
Wow, that is so mysterious.

537
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,605
Is it some kind of virus?

538
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:06,821
What is this?

539
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,116
What are you doing now?

540
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:11,909
Let's find out.

541
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,037
We're not getting out until I change.

542
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,248
We will stay here together overnight.

543
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,377
Wow, you are just amazing.

544
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,797
You act really well.

545
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,258
Why spend your energy on this?

546
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,926
There is a simpler way.

547
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,762
I'm going on a reality show.

548
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,473
Did I tell you last time?

549
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,434
Please, join the show.

550
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,562
They film us 24 hours.

551
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,189
Why...

552
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:44,733
reject it?

553
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,863
OK, let's do it, if you can't believe me.

554
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,156
Wow,

555
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,325
the program will be a big hit.

556
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,202
Thank you.

557
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,123
EMERGENCY CALL

558
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,625
-Hello?
-Hey.

559
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,295
-Yes?
-We are stuck here.

560
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:05,254
OK.

561
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,382
The press is already out.

562
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,887
That scumbag was waiting for it.

563
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:17,099
It's a miracle that
I hadn't been discovered until now.

564
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,228
Don't worry. I will take care of this.

565
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,190
You?

566
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,901
How?

567
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:28,694
Han Se-gye,

568
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,030
do you trust me?

569
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:04,605
Brother!

570
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:12,988
I know you don't like me,
but how can you completely ignore me?

571
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:15,324
-It's not that--
-CEO Kim as well!

572
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,911
Are you going to ignore me?

573
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:20,663
It has been a while.

574
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:26,377
That's not it.
It's that my vision has been blurry.

575
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,754
I didn't recognize you at first.

576
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:33,425
Such a beautiful lady recognizes me first.
It feels good!

577
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,179
Maybe it's time for you to take a break.

578
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,597
No way!

579
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,142
What are you doing? Let's go.

580
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,741
There's something.

581
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,536
I don't know what it is, though.

582
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,257
Thank you.

583
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,845
You're welcome.

584
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,181
I don't like when someone else beats

585
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,684
the one I have been beating.

586
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,321
That's the fish I gave you.

587
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,116
It's still alive.

588
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,493
It's my favorite.

589
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,374
I didn't know it was you

590
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:51,545
because you called me brother and
your style has changed.

591
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,842
Did you come here to check
if my disease is real?

592
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:58,636
No.

593
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:04,099
I came here to check how I feel.

594
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:08,270
I wanted to see
if I would feel comfortable or not.

595
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,023
So?

596
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,451
I feel uncomfortable.

597
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:30,417
Choi Gi-ho gave me the medical record.

598
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,755
He must be conspiring with CEO Kim

599
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:36,965
to take you down.

600
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,137
Why are you telling me that?

601
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,435
Frankly, I was with them.

602
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,397
But I just decided to betray them.

603
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:54,650
Why? Because you feel sorry for me?

604
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:55,734
No!

605
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:03,867
Because the person I like does not like
bad people.

606
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,832
Are you dating?

607
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,502
Who is he? What does he do?

608
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:39,278
Oh, dear!

609
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:47,828
CHAE YU-RI

610
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,722
What do we do? She is not picking up.

611
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:10,809
She is driving me nuts!
I changed the show to fit her.

612
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,188
I know. Why isn't she coming?

613
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,148
Did she run away again?

614
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,234
I'm sorry.

615
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:24,323
I wanted to resolve the misunderstanding
and reconcile with her this time.

616
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:26,784
Maybe I was the only one.

617
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:29,495
I was wrong
about how she feels about this.

618
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,664
No, it's not your fault.

619
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:36,835
Who knew Han Se-gye would run like that?

620
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,879
Let's call it off.

621
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:40,672
I knew she would run.

622
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:47,262
TO SE-GYE: IF YOU DON'T COME,
I GO TO YOU.

623
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:52,559
Writer! She wants us to go to her place.

624
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,937
She did all the preparation there.

625
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:15,040
If you don't come,
I go to you.

626
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:19,962
TO: YOU U-MI

627
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:34,643
I'll take care of it. Go to my house.

628
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:46,488
Trust me. Go there and wait.
I will be there soon.

629
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,618
Driver, please take good care of him.

630
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,562
RYU EUN-HO

631
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:22,649
-Hi, What's up?
-Eun-ho.

632
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,234
Listen carefully.

633
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:26,695
Yes. I can hear you fine.
What is it?

634
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,947
Go to my place later.

635
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:29,865
Why?

636
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:31,199
Se-gye is...

637
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:34,953
Just go.

638
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:38,665
What's this?

639
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:49,843
Reporter Park, I got in an accident.

640
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:54,348
OK. Let's think straight.

641
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:56,475
This was my mistake.

642
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,937
I caused all these problems.

643
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:04,149
I'm her agent.

644
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,652
I'm her friend.

645
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,451
So, I should take responsibility.

646
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:43,188
The World Entertainment president was
hospitalized due to an accident.

647
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,776
Se-gye's schedule got canceled.
She can't come.

648
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:49,027
AGENT IN ACCIDENT

649
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,404
I thought she ran away.

650
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:53,490
Wow! This is how you get out of it!

651
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,413
Isn't that a lie?

652
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,123
I wouldn't say so.

653
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:05,460
It doesn't look like a big crash,
but the president's in shock and a coma.

654
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,427
Where is You U-mi?

655
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:25,313
You U-mi!

656
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,027
U-mi!

657
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:33,905
AGENT IN ACCIDENT

658
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,992
WORLD ENTERTAINMENT PRESIDENT
IN ACCIDENT

659
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:39,119
SE-GYE CANCELS SHOWS
DUE TO ACCIDENT

660
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:46,334
SE-GYE CANCELS SHOWS
DUE TO ACCIDENT.

661
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,514
RYU EUN-HO

662
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:05,937
I'm at the hospital.

663
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:09,357
I'm on my way now, so just wait there.

664
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,153
It's because of me.

665
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,156
All because of me...

666
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:26,249
Is Han Se-gye hospitalized here?

667
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,045
No.

668
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:33,423
Then, has there been any unidentified man,

669
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:35,467
or woman...

670
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:38,178
or even a kid...

671
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:45,602
anyone who was brought here with You U-mi?

672
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:51,316
There was no one.

673
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,028
Thank you.

674
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:08,250
Hello!

675
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:09,501
This is Seo Do-jae.

676
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:13,255
I can't get a hold of Han Se-gye,
so I'm worried.

677
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:16,424
I'm on my way to U-mi's.

678
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:19,344
Before the accident,
U-mi asked me to go there.

679
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,139
Se-gye probably is there.

680
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,974
I'll call when I get there.

681
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:33,650
Se-gye!

682
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:43,285
Han Se-gye!

683
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:48,957
Se-gye!

684
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,302
TO: SEO DO-JAE

685
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:04,264
She is not here.

686
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:29,748
I will be somewhere else for a while.

687
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,042
Sorry.

688
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:34,187
The plane we purchased has a little issue.

689
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,856
But I took care of it.

690
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:41,736
The plane we will purchase next time is
a different kind, and this--

691
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,572
CEO MEETING INFO

692
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:51,037
It has been over a week.

693
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,759
TO: AUNTIE

694
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:10,598
PLEASE...

695
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,563
Han Se-gye, are you OK?

696
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:21,276
Where are you? I will go to you.

697
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:23,528
Answer the phone.

698
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,031
Call me.

699
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:27,490
Where are you?

700
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:29,868
Please...

701
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:51,222
Stop the car.

702
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:08,823
I'm sorry.

703
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:07,901
Han Se-gye!

704
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:29,631
AUNTIE

705
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,304
Are you really...

706
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:41,643
I'm sorry.

707
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:50,360
My face...

708
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:17,136
My face is not coming back.

709
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,738
