1
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:48,631
-That's Han Se-gye.
-She's here.

2
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,853
-It is her.
-Han Se-gye, can you say a word?

3
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:05,023
-It was true.
-Are you admitting the relationship?

4
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,151
Smile.

5
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,365
As if you're happy.

6
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,090
-What's your relationship?
-Are you in a relationship?

7
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,800
You said it was a business relationship.

8
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:35,053
You caught us here, so we won't lie.

9
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,139
It's strange for us to do business
by ourselves in a theater.

10
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,391
What you're looking at is true.

11
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,727
Write what you see.

12
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,106
We are getting to know each other
with affection.

13
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,928
I will tell you the details
during an interview later.

14
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,765
But I will not interview
with any press who follow us.

15
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,934
Please remember this.

16
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,584
"EPISODE 5"

17
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,505
Oh my god. What will I do?

18
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,133
This is crazy.

19
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,930
-Are you crying?
-No!

20
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,725
-Do you think I cry everyday?
-I thought you did.

21
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,143
Why did you say such a thing?

22
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,521
You're the one who wanted
to watch a movie.

23
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:09,981
It's all because of you.

24
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,568
So listen to me.

25
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,154
Since you're the one who brought this
upon me, just do what I say.

26
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,825
You can deny it once, but not twice.

27
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,119
You will look ridiculous.

28
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,580
If I look ridiculous, you will, too.

29
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,583
I don't want that,
so let's make a good image.

30
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:33,963
Let's make it look like we met
and broke up in a beautiful way.

31
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,259
You're so clever, even in this situation.

32
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,053
Let's try it.

33
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,141
Let's be the couple of the century.

34
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,693
REPORTER PARK

35
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,362
Why's he calling all of sudden?

36
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,197
Hello?

37
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,575
I'm on my way home...

38
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,288
-That's agent You.
-Han Se-gye's manager?

39
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,207
Is it true that Han Se-gye is
in a relationship?

40
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,668
-We've waited so long.
-Please answer.

41
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,095
What is this? Who are you?

42
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,270
What's happening? What are they doing?

43
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,563
They're driving me crazy!

44
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,613
What is this?

45
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:42,824
What do you think?

46
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,034
Running for love.

47
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:48,204
-Are we?
-Are you nuts? Se-gye is running.

48
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,709
Since when is Sunho Group so widely
covered in the public media?

49
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,754
Is the Secretary Department just watching
while the media writes whatever they want?

50
00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:00,133
The articles were delivered to the media
by Secretary Jeong Ju-hwan.

51
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,805
There is something
between the two of them.

52
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,434
Find out about Han Se-gye.

53
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,311
How much do you want to know?

54
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:15,940
Family, friends, men,
and all other relations.

55
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:19,527
Find out every detail
from the smallest thing to huge matters.

56
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,783
-You're here!
-What are you doing?

57
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,202
I have an important thing to do.

58
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,872
Why are you doing an important thing
on my computer?

59
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,208
Hey!

60
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,544
You must take responsibility
for your actions.

61
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,797
Does it have to be this way?

62
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:44,719
Does it?

63
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,264
Good job!

64
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,392
You came earlier than expected.

65
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,686
Would you like some coffee?

66
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,272
Did I give you that position
to serve coffee?

67
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,524
I told you to remove her.
Instead, you brought her in.

68
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,319
Why are you doing that to him?
I'm the one who caused all this.

69
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,989
Break up with her immediately.
She does not help your life or business.

70
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,743
It would be funny to issue break-up news
right after admitting the relationship.

71
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,080
Do you know how many men she's dated?

72
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:16,376
Switching men is easier for her
than switching her lipstick.

73
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,920
Everyone knows that.
Are you the only one who doesn't?

74
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,338
So what?

75
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,216
That's why I'm trying to date her.

76
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,551
You wanted me to meet a girl.

77
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,013
I didn't mean you should meet whoever.

78
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,807
Love has to feed you.

79
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,186
You don't care that you might not
inherit the company, do you?

80
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,022
I do. That is why I am doing this.

81
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:43,778
I think this love will feed me.

82
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,032
Is... is he going crazy?

83
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,827
He's crazy for love.

84
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,997
You're crazy! I'll kill you today!

85
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,875
You, come here! Let go of me.

86
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,421
You said you will think about it
during your break! During the break!

87
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:06,551
-Stop.
-Did I say to take a break or not? I did!

88
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,387
Patience!
Three patiences will prevent murder.

89
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,724
This has 30 patiences! Let go of me!

90
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,810
Take it easy. Take a deep breath!

91
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:19,063
I just went to the movies to take a break.

92
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:24,193
-What the?
-Hide your face. She'll get more mad.

93
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:28,489
Why does it have to be with a man?
Why does it have to be Seo Do-jae?

94
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,992
I'm not in a relationship with him.

95
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:35,997
I have something to say, too. I didn't
know he'd come to the airport.

96
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,623
Airport?

97
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,335
Did you go somewhere without telling me?

98
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,714
-I have a reason...
-I quit.

99
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,508
Let go.

100
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,722
Is it so hard to call me?

101
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,766
Is it so hard to stay put?

102
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,937
If this is how you're gonna be,
leave me alone. I quit.

103
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,483
U-mi!

104
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:08,196
Don't you know her? Leave her alone.
Following her would not help.

105
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,551
-Hello?
-This is Seo Do-jae's mother.

106
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,596
We have something to talk about.

107
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,349
Text me your address.
I will send a car for you.

108
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,268
-Well...
-Talk to me in person.

109
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,568
It's a tornado after a typhoon.

110
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,320
What is it?

111
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,781
-She wants to meet.
-Who?

112
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:55,284
-Seo Do-jae's mother.
-Your mother-in-law?

113
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,411
What are you talking about?

114
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,127
SEO DO-JAE'S WOMAN HAN SE-GYE

115
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:10,967
Do you want to be a part of our family?

116
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,844
Please get out of the way
if you're just gonna talk gibberish.

117
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,806
He's a jerk, you are right.

118
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,767
This can't be.

119
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,396
They're not dating.

120
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,940
What are they planning?

121
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,067
SUNHO GROUP'S
FIRST CELEBRITY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW?

122
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:07,106
What a mess. No wonder I lose ideas.

123
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,698
SNAIL BRIDE MAID SEREVICE

124
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,657
Snail Bride?

125
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:34,800
It's quiet in this cafe.
Maybe it's because it's a weekday.

126
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,845
I told them to clear the place.

127
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,057
It runs in the family.

128
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,311
I've seen this before.

129
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:52,902
Not many reporters are following you.
You may not be that famous.

130
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,321
This has occasionally happened before.

131
00:10:55,905 --> 00:11:00,242
Please hurry if you have something to say.
I need to catch someone important.

132
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,538
Who? A man?

133
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,876
-Excuse me?
-I heard you won't meet anyone.

134
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,252
And that you have a child.

135
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,506
Please leave my son immediately.

136
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,800
You'll only be a weakness for him.

137
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,307
Is it funny?

138
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,936
I was wondering
why your son was always scared.

139
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,313
He got it from you.

140
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,192
-What?
-You are right.

141
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,444
I am Seo Do-jae's weakness.

142
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,406
And it's unfair to attack the weakness.

143
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,826
You're saying you won't break up
with my son?

144
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,579
Not for a while. Sorry.

145
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,835
OK. I understand.

146
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,963
I will pay you well.

147
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,757
I don't need money.

148
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,721
Silly girl. Stop acting up.

149
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:09,145
It doesn't matter if you need it or not.
If I want to pay you, I will. And I did.

150
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,006
FROM MOTHER OF SEO DO-JAE
ONE HUNDRED MILLION WON

151
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,592
-Wow!
-He learned how to threaten from his mom.

152
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,554
I'm scared. How did she find out my
account number?

153
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,186
-Did you sell my information?
-What?

154
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,981
-How much could I make that way?
-Shut up.

155
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,902
-It's just 100 million won.
-Of course, let's donate it--

156
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,445
Hey! Stop it!

157
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,239
Then, are you gonna break up
for the money?

158
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,533
I don't know, OK?

159
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,328
That's not a problem.
What am I gonna do with U-mi?

160
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,580
You two have been together
for way too long.

161
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,499
It's about the time you separate.

162
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,000
-Really?
-Sure.

163
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,419
As the saying goes,
"Strike while the iron is hot",

164
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,630
we won't be friends anymore
if this comes apart.

165
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,799
Did you get your nails done?
They look good.

166
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:25,012
No one is on my side.
All I have left is a weirdo!

167
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,097
U-mi, I miss you!

168
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,308
So, why did you fly
to another country like that?

169
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,852
-Disconnect this now.
-I need to go to work.

170
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,147
I'll do that in about 100 years.

171
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,609
Eun-ho, are you just thinking
about making money in this situation?

172
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:42,196
You're a traitor.
I did everything for you.

173
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,615
U-mi!

174
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,701
So loud!
You are the one who caused all this.

175
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,705
-Just do what you are good at.
-Like what?

176
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:52,957
Beg!

177
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,126
Am I good at that?

178
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,049
-How are you?
-Not good.

179
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,969
Who approved such media stories?

180
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,929
Take them down right now.

181
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,640
How dare you say "Seo Do-jae's woman"?

182
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:13,727
-Se-gye is too good for him.
-The Director is too good for her.

183
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,980
He's the successor of Sunho Group.

184
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,941
Whatever. Take down the photos first.

185
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,779
Se-gye didn't even wear make-up!

186
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,698
Only he is wearing a nice suit!

187
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,868
It's wrong, even if they're in
a fake relationship.

188
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,160
You said that right.

189
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:34,039
It's not real, and we tried
to mitigate the risk as much as we can.

190
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,749
How much more do we have to
accommodate?

191
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,501
Are you kidding?

192
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,420
Let's get this straight.

193
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,673
You are the one who needs Se-gye
for your business purposes.

194
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,967
You know she is in the relationship.

195
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,844
Did you invite me here to fight?

196
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,221
Then let's step outside.

197
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,181
I'm cut out for office work.

198
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,100
I'm not an expendable on-site worker.

199
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,147
You were born to annoy people.

200
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,899
I hear that a lot.

201
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:03,193
But I am not here to annoy you.

202
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:07,197
-I'm here to ask for your cooperation.
-Cooperation?

203
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:13,162
We need to stage a nice beginning
and a nice breakup for the relationship.

204
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,878
Hold on.

205
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:22,796
Hello?

206
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,257
Director Lee?

207
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,474
What is this?

208
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,477
Oh jeez! You startled me!

209
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,489
What is this?

210
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,627
If you get lucky, by next year,

211
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,380
you'll work with one of these, too.

212
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,012
I can do that now.

213
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,891
I know. I know you can do that now.

214
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,060
But remember.

215
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:25,150
No matter what happens,
you're my perfect friend.

216
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,241
Will you accept my apology?

217
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:40,916
Gging-ggang.

218
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,593
I am sorry.

219
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,513
What I did was wrong.

220
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,890
Please forgive me this time.

221
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,859
What's this? Huh?

222
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,403
What the heck are you doing here?

223
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,405
Why did you lay down all these candles?

224
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,906
Is there a blackout?

225
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:17,703
If you play with fire, you'll wet
the bed.

226
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,205
This is an event, don't you see?

227
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,125
Just say "I am sorry, friend. I love you."

228
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,003
Whatever it is, blow them out and go.

229
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,339
-Why are you doing this in my yard?
-Why are you doing that?

230
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,925
Who is going to clean this up now?

231
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,219
Go in. Don't worry.

232
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,639
I will clean this up. Sorry.
Good night.

233
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:38,724
Good night!

234
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,815
I'm sorry.

235
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,610
I apologize.

236
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,366
Please accept my apology.

237
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,749
Gging-ggang!

238
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,711
You accepted my apology! You did!

239
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,717
I wish I could be you, just for a day.

240
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,969
I wonder what you think all the time.

241
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,554
No, that would be hard for you.

242
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,475
I hate you. I am sick of you!

243
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,478
Lastly, say whatever you want to me.

244
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,565
You can even swear. Anything is OK.

245
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,027
Good. I have something to say.

246
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,617
-I'm ready.
-You...

247
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:43,163
are invited to come for an audition
for the film directed by Director Lee.

248
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,419
He said if being an extra is OK,
you can come for an audition.

249
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,880
All by yourself, without a manager.

250
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,800
He said to get ready to leave
everything behind, like a real beginner.

251
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,054
I heard you flew to persuade Director Lee.

252
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,099
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't understand.

253
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,144
Pack up.

254
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,229
There are no reporters
in front of your home.

255
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,107
U-mi!

256
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,819
What do I need to prepare?
What should I do?

257
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,488
-A public date?
-What did you expect?

258
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,658
If you want to break up,
you should enter a relationship first.

259
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,869
I don't have time for a date.

260
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,746
-I need to work.
-This is work.

261
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,748
Pretending to have a date.

262
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,585
I need a rest. I'm overworked.

263
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,254
I didn't make this happen.

264
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,550
You did.

265
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,262
So when, where, and how?

266
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,557
I need to check one thing first.

267
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,935
Have you ever...

268
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:49,938
gone out on a date?

269
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,150
What do you think I am?

270
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,762
Have you been waiting long?

271
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:23,889
Hey!

272
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,442
Who the hell is she?

273
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,528
Oh... that's not it.

274
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,698
Se-mi, who the hell is he?

275
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,873
It just wasn't a good experience.

276
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,795
We both decided not to go with you.

277
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,421
You are not kids.

278
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,633
It doesn't look right
if managers accompany you during the date.

279
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,594
A public... date?

280
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,682
Public date... with him. No.

281
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,058
An OK-with-public

282
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,686
da...te...

283
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,106
Why? Don't you want to go?

284
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,278
Not at all!

285
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,823
I can do it just fine.

286
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:27,160
I am good at work.
I will do this perfectly.

287
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,956
"Perfectly?" I don't believe it.

288
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,293
Have you ever dated anyone?

289
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,420
What you do you think I am?

290
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,806
How come you disappear every time we meet?

291
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,058
Sorry.

292
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,896
There's a reason for it.

293
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,607
If this is how you're gonna be,
you shouldn't date anyone.

294
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,028
Or find someone
who'll bear with your disappearances.

295
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,113
That is, if anyone would.

296
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:18,420
Most of the time...
my relationships end before dating.

297
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,425
Just remember that there is nothing
special about dating.

298
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,511
When you think it's special,
problems arise.

299
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,891
How to date.

300
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:35,896
Do not reply with one line.
Focus solely on dating.

301
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,315
Show and talk about yourself.

302
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:43,362
You should just act like someone
you've seen somewhere.

303
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,406
How to date.

304
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,451
One, set up a plan.
Two, don't be nervous.

305
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:53,497
Three, hold her hand.
Four, show your humor.

306
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,208
Five, be a good listener.

307
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,816
This is nothing. This is nothing.

308
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,276
-I can hear it.
-You can hear it.

309
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,569
Come over here, please.

310
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,699
Look, it's Han Se-gye!

311
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,001
-Have a seat.
-I already did.

312
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,121
What's this?

313
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:19,207
I just want to make progress
given the seriousness of the situation.

314
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,711
I'll act like someone you've seen a lot.

315
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,546
Open your mouth.

316
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,095
Take it and smile quickly,
so that we can finish this quickly.

317
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,316
You chose a good place with lots of light.

318
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,110
The pictures will come out nicely.

319
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,703
-Again?
-The last picture won't look good.

320
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:02,125
Smile, while looking at me,
in a pretty way.

321
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,381
And don't be picky with food.

322
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,928
You've seen a lot of dating scenes.

323
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:19,893
This is nothing. This is nothing.

324
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:49,839
By the way, do you know
your mother's bank account number?

325
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:51,758
Did you meet my mother?

326
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,053
Don't worry. It wasn't that bad.

327
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:58,056
You're still alive. How is it possible?

328
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,768
Is that a joke?

329
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:04,020
No, I'm serious.

330
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,416
100,000,100 WON
FROM HAN SE-GYE

331
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,086
Look at this!

332
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:44,019
200,000,100 WON
TO HAN SE-GYE.

333
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:05,624
Hello.

334
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,758
200,000,100 WON

335
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:18,762
Excuse me.

336
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,360
I wanted to ask
about the wire transfer cap.

337
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:38,156
I'm asking how I can increase the limit.

338
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,992
Please increase it to one billion won.

339
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:46,915
I feel tragic and mortified
as I cannot send the money back.

340
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,836
I have to visit the bank?

341
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,130
You can't do it now?

342
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,467
I see.

343
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:00,804
OK.

344
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,912
-Do you want it? Shall I get one for you?
-No thanks.

345
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:30,208
You like that? You have grown-up taste.

346
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:34,921
Well, even though time passes,
it remains.

347
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:37,298
This is a replica.

348
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,428
I'll get this.

349
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,915
Poor Mr. Park!

350
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,501
He has to follow us around
and take pictures.

351
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,923
People do not flock to you
like I expected.

352
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,593
They're busy thinking
about their love lives.

353
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,344
Who has time
for other people's love lives?

354
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,721
Especially during the weekdays!

355
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:28,141
You're off guard again. Didn't you learn?

356
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,439
It looks like you've met a lot of women.

357
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:37,650
Is this one of those questions?

358
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,694
"Questions shall be answered
without running away."

359
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,197
-I guess.
-Let's say it is.

360
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,617
How could I have?
I don't even recognize their faces.

361
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,829
Then, I will ask a question, too.

362
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:54,417
It's a little bit late to ask now,
but do you have a boyfriend?

363
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:58,046
How could I have?
I run away without saying a word.

364
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,924
-Why?
-Someone said you do.

365
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,260
It's all rumor. Don't believe it.
You should know better.

366
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,847
Then, why did you ask?

367
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,604
You just... seem accustomed
to walking here.

368
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,232
This is a hot spot for dating.

369
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,611
Because I used to come here often.

370
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,572
-With a girl?
-Alone.

371
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,660
I used to watch passers-by alone.

372
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:17,959
I looked at people and practiced
how to tell them apart,

373
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,461
although it didn't help.

374
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:37,186
-Why do you sit here all the time?
-Excuse me?

375
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,858
Here, take this.

376
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:44,277
OK.

377
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,280
Cheer up. You can do it!

378
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,221
I saw her everyday,
but I did not recognize her

379
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,973
because she had different clothes on.

380
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,060
I felt so dumb and worthless.

381
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,145
Poor you.

382
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,815
You're right. I am a poor guy.

383
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,068
Was I too rude just now?

384
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:29,572
It's OK for a poor person like me
to call myself a poor guy.

385
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,242
It's my turn now.

386
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:39,457
Is that necklace... some kind of ID?

387
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,293
This?

388
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:46,422
I woke up one day, and I was scared.

389
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,094
I wondered if I was still me.

390
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,764
You know, it was like
Dream of a Butterfly.

391
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,226
I didn't know if I became a butterfly
in my dream,

392
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,603
or if the butterfly dreamed of me.

393
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,944
Putting this one on your kid will make
you feel better.

394
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,489
HAN SE-GYE

395
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,615
Is the kid big?

396
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,621
Some days he looks big,

397
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:05,626
but other days he looks small,
just like that.

398
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,128
Kids are all like that.

399
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:11,424
Even though they look so grown,
they are still kids sometimes.

400
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,111
I'm trying not to forget.

401
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,031
And...

402
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,495
I might not be able to come back to me.

403
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,752
Isn't my story sadder?

404
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:50,713
When will we sleep together?

405
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:08,856
The house is huge!

406
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:12,819
She's looking for a strong person.
She said there's a lot to clean.

407
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,738
You're stronger than the old ladies here.

408
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:35,049
Not only is the house big,

409
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,802
but the job is, too!

410
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,360
KANG SA-RA

411
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,697
-Hello?
-Are they really dating?

412
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,700
That's not it, right?
There's something between them.

413
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:05,872
Just answer. Is there anything
between Han Se-gye and Seo Do-jae?

414
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,541
You called out of the blue
to ask such nonsense.

415
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:09,500
No...

416
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,420
I feel that my brother is bothering you.

417
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:15,131
You must feel offended by my brother.

418
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:24,432
That is true. Your brother isn't really
the pleasant type.

419
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:28,186
If you want to ask something about Se-gye,
ask her directly.

420
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,021
Stop seducing me like this.

421
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:31,480
Seduce?

422
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:38,362
You look so innocent, but I see you have
a freewheeling lifestyle.

423
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:44,327
Fine. If you answer,
I'll meet with you once.

424
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,454
You said you were desperate before.

425
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:50,791
My desperation is gone.
Now I am busy at work. So, bye.

426
00:36:57,256 --> 00:37:00,468
Now where should I... start?

427
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:10,978
His girlfriend is dating another man.
He must not feel good.

428
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:19,654
SWEET DATE BETWEEN HAN SE-GYE
AND SEO DO-JAE.

429
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,368
T-ROAD STOCK PRICE

430
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,873
It is all bogus!

431
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,518
-Excuse me.
-Eun-ho is not here today.

432
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:52,895
I've told you this, like 50 times now.

433
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,396
Do you want one?

434
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,151
No thanks!

435
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,991
This is a new perfume. Try this.

436
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,940
There's no water to chill in here.

437
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,532
She must be just eating bread.

438
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,956
You didn't have to drop me off at home.

439
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,541
Mr. Park went home a while ago.

440
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,043
He's not the reason that
I brought you home.

441
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,213
I've seen many dating scenes.

442
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,133
Go in. It was a long day.

443
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:34,390
Can I ask you a favor?

444
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:39,854
Can you not say such things in public?

445
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:42,690
"Go in. It was a long day?"

446
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:43,983
Not that.

447
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,280
Never mind.

448
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,873
-From tomorrow night!
-What is?

449
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,417
That. Let's begin from tomorrow night.

450
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,627
Oh.

451
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:07,047
I have an audition early tomorrow.
I'll call you after that.

452
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:26,859
Do you want to come in?

453
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,112
I have to let you know
before we sleep together.

454
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,281
First, no revealing clothes.

455
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,241
That goes without saying.

456
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,619
Second, no dark intentions.

457
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,579
It's OK if it doesn't get discovered.

458
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,749
-What?
-That was a joke.

459
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,919
Smile when you make jokes!

460
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,089
No touching, by any means.

461
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:50,758
I have a big bed.

462
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,804
-Have we decided to go to your house?
-Kind of.

463
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,557
And this.

464
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:05,105
I want you to be prepared.

465
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:08,901
I can turn into someone who wears
this kind of clothes,

466
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:14,740
or someone who wears this kind.

467
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,367
Who decides that?

468
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,997
Clothes don't indicate gender or age.
I know that very well.

469
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:26,835
Someone wearing a man's clothes is
not necessarily a man.

470
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:28,671
And vice versa.

471
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,215
Aren't you scared?

472
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,132
No.

473
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:37,012
To me, whether you wear these clothes
or those clothes,

474
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,224
you will still be you.

475
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:03,622
I think I can show these to you
as you don't seem scared.

476
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:06,333
They're my housemates.

477
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,759
He had a scandal with me.

478
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,387
He was believed to be my son.

479
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,849
He came to my Award Ceremony.

480
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:25,394
She...

481
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:30,858
You know her. She was the one you helped.

482
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:46,332
All these people are... me.

483
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:52,463
This is like a memorial...

484
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,257
Memorial?

485
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:57,593
That only I can remember.

486
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,558
Lives that last only seven days.

487
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:17,988
I will take a photo of my real face
and place it over there, before I die.

488
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,928
Then, see you tomorrow.

489
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,224
That makes me sad...

490
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:50,229
because I don't know
if I can see you tomorrow or not.

491
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:53,148
See you.

492
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,946
See you again. I will recognize you.

493
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:04,910
Good night.

494
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,104
This is crazy.

495
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,275
Why is my heart pounding?

496
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,582
Is he Cinderella or something?

497
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:53,959
He was everywhere before,

498
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,336
and then disappears when I need him.

499
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:37,961
It smells nice.

500
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,482
I will get fat!

501
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,714
Where did I see him?

502
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,233
Sending you alone reminds me
of those old days.

503
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:44,403
Don't talk like that.
It makes us seem old.

504
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:47,739
Are you coming home
right after the audition?

505
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,575
I will meet Seo Do-jae.

506
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,704
I told you this time.

507
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:58,750
OK. I'm sure there must be a reason.

508
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:04,840
-U-mi, you trust me. Right?
-I do!

509
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:09,511
I always stick with a strong person.

510
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:12,264
You are the strongest one.

511
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,559
-Go and kill everyone!
-Kill everyone!

512
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,145
You can do it.

513
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,195
-Don't cause trouble.
-You, either.

514
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:35,787
Good luck!

515
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,542
SIX MOVIE OPEN AUDITION

516
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:46,673
Han Se-Gye is here.

517
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:54,806
Han Se-Gye is here.

518
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:08,695
Oh, hi!

519
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,366
Are you here for the audition?

520
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,079
-Yes.
-Really?

521
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:22,876
Did the director not give you a role
even after you knelt down?

522
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:24,962
She knelt down?

523
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,467
-She is tenatious.
-Why did she do that?

524
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:32,302
To get the part?

525
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,184
No, he didn't give me a role.

526
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:42,479
He was so mean!

527
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,856
You must really want this.

528
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,736
I'm here to see him.
I will tell him about this.

529
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:54,574
-No need.
-I must. You're working so hard on this.

530
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,244
I should do whatever I can do
as your junior.

531
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:00,288
-He'll listen to me.
-I said no need.

532
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:04,084
Did I upset you?

533
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:10,674
I just wanted to help,
as you look so desperate to get his role.

534
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:11,925
I will get it.

535
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:17,389
You don't have to tell him.
I will get my role on my own.

536
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:25,480
If you say so. I look forward to it.

537
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,992
They don't seem to get along.

538
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,119
I feel bad for her.

539
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,921
So you came alone.

540
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,257
I heard you had other offers

541
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:53,550
as a main character.

542
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:56,011
I want to be in your film.

543
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,264
Why?

544
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:04,311
Oh, I hope I didn't upset her again.

545
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:12,360
I was just curious how you can be
so passionate about acting and films.

546
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:17,157
Because I so want to act with Chae Yu-ri.

547
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:24,748
OK then,
let's read the second scene together.

548
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:37,260
Why is it me? Why me?

549
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:44,226
You are broken, imperfect, and useless.

550
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,228
I didn't choose to be born like this.

551
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:49,981
You can't live a happy life like that.
You know it.

552
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:54,820
I will live a happy life.

553
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,616
Don't live blaming yourself.

554
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:04,287
Just die blaming me.

555
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:05,372
Don't get close.

556
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:07,958
Don't come!

557
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,049
I will take it all with me.

558
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:19,761
I will give you comfort.

559
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:23,473
Hold on.

560
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:29,646
Why are you crying?
The script says "in a cold tone."

561
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,567
I'm sorry, but I felt so bad for her.

562
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,322
Do you kill her when you feel bad for her?

563
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:43,201
She can feel like she must kill her
as she's genuinely compassionate.

564
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:05,242
Stay still.

565
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:09,120
You might not have recognized me.
That's why.

566
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:14,125
You must believe my weakness now.

567
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:15,877
It's been a while.

568
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,673
-What's up with the flowers?
-They serve many purposes.

569
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:23,468
I tried to be the couple of the century
as I came here to pick you up.

570
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,762
You are good at your work.

571
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:28,431
Is there anything else you want to say?

572
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:31,601
How did your audition go? Did you do well?

573
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:36,815
Of course. Don't you know me?

574
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:38,650
I am Han Se-gye.

575
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:43,154
Buying flowers was a good choice.

576
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,375
Doesn't he have principles?

577
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,378
He said he wouldn't work with you.
So he should've kept his word.

578
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,922
But my acting was too good.

579
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:05,593
I'm going to show Chae Yu-ri
how good I am.

580
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:07,971
Where are you going?

581
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:09,931
I'm gonna make ramen.

582
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:12,892
I'm hungry.

583
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:34,205
This is so good. You're a pro.

584
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,710
-I didn't say it was for you.
-Got it. I'll pay you back.

585
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:41,171
Forget about this.

586
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:44,049
Read the line for me.

587
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:45,592
Me?

588
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:50,805
My success is your success.
Don't you like to succeed?

589
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:59,022
"We are broken, both you and me."

590
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,025
You have no emotion.

591
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,985
Do it again. Do it right, please.

592
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,620
-Here I go.
-Go ahead.

593
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:19,959
"But now I know you're there.

594
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,255
So I came out to the world.

595
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:31,429
Maybe you've waited for me."

596
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,105
Aren't you gonna do your line?

597
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:45,902
Oh I forgot. What was the line?

598
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,489
-When will we sleep?
-Oh, my!

599
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:51,908
Is sleeping all you know?

600
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:40,957
A razor! I can't use one of those.

601
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,919
It feels weird to have this conversation
with a woman.

602
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:48,715
I cut myself last time I shaved.

603
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:58,349
You are so good at shaving.

604
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:01,019
I'll teach you when I get a chance.

605
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:06,816
Really? Can I ask you to teach me
one more thing?

606
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,450
You have so many clothes!

607
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:20,163
I know you're rich,
but this is extravagant.

608
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:22,040
Do you sell clothes?

609
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,043
These are like faces to me.

610
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:29,172
I can't recognize my face,
but I can recognize my clothes.

611
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:37,680
Try this.

612
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,660
I can't get this part.

613
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:15,426
Like that?

614
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,238
I see dark intentions in your eyes.

615
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:38,074
That is... so wrong!

616
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:45,081
I don't know how you keep this on.

617
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:56,509
I warn you. If you invade, it's a war.

618
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:59,178
I will call the police.

619
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:06,811
Your bed is really big.

620
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,939
Why? Are you disappointed?

621
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,446
I don't know what I will become.

622
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,699
You say that.

623
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:23,786
But I don't believe it 100%.

624
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:26,956
I might become an old man.

625
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:28,416
Then I will respect you.

626
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:31,669
-It might not be tonight.
-We'll sleep together tomorrow, too.

627
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:36,758
Can you please think before you speak?

628
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,427
Why? Do you get dark intentions?

629
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:42,055
Stop speaking boloney.

630
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:45,767
It's OK. Just don't get discovered.

631
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:53,941
You don't remember my face,
so how will you recognize my new face?

632
01:00:55,693 --> 01:00:57,111
Now that you mention it,

633
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:01,741
may I touch your face?

634
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,708
I'm not gonna close my eyes.

635
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:15,004
That would be weird.

636
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:45,159
You are ugly.

637
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:48,579
You're not any better.

638
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:58,297
Your face is like...

639
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:02,635
Maybe Jeong was right.

640
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,220
Maybe he is crazy.

641
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,128
Are you up?

642
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,217
You didn't change, right?

643
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:26,677
Your voice is the same, too.

644
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:34,977
That's right.

645
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:38,147
What is this? You didn't change.

646
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:40,525
Did you deceive me?

647
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:52,620
Why are you picking a fight
so early in the morning?

648
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:58,793
I told you last night
that I might not change.

649
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:01,796
Maybe it's not today.

650
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:07,301
Did you do that on purpose
to stay with me?

651
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:12,181
You are the one who wanted
to sleep together, not me.

652
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:16,102
It's OK so be honest with me.
Since when have you deceived me?

653
01:04:16,727 --> 01:04:18,104
I said that's not it!

654
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:21,691
This is so frustrating.

655
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:26,404
Why didn't I change at the right time?

656
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:33,953
I said I didn't want to.

657
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:37,123
But you kept asking me to sleep together.

658
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:39,417
That's because I didn't know
you wouldn't change.

659
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,711
Wow, you are bad. Real bad.

660
01:04:43,337 --> 01:04:45,923
Don't you think about the future?
Don't you have tomorrow?

661
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:49,844
Who said,
"We will sleep together tomorrow"?

662
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:53,598
What are you guys doing?

663
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:56,350
Mother?

664
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:02,189
-What are you doing here?
-What am I doing?

665
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:06,235
Are you crazy?
You're even bringing her home now?

666
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:09,447
-Why don't you live together?
-I can explain everything.

667
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:12,283
You, uncover yourself!

668
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:14,952
You won't come out?

669
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:19,624
Mother, listen.
I understand your confusion.

670
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:23,753
She received 200,000,000 won from me.
She probably didn't tell you.

671
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,129
You gave her money?

672
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:28,716
Get the answer from her.

673
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:54,075
What... what is...

674
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:56,911
Hello!

675
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:01,958
You...

676
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:05,503
It was you two...

677
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:09,173
talking just now? You two?

678
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:18,140
-My son is ga...
-No, that's not it.

679
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:24,939
-With a high school kid...
-No!

680
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:34,824
Mother! Mother!

681
01:06:57,304 --> 01:07:00,224
-How old is he?
-18? Or 19?

682
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:03,978
-What are you doing?
-What's the matter? We're both men now.

683
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:05,896
-Was he not surprised?
-Huh?

684
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,732
Did he say "Hi Se-gye!"

685
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:11,360
Han Se-gye, you didn't forget the clause
about not running away, right?

686
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:14,113
-You don't run away, either.
-You must be her.

687
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:18,409
Were you crying?

688
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:21,829
-Is this allowed?
-It is.

689
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:23,539
It's mine.

690
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,382
