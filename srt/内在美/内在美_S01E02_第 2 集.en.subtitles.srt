00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,924
"EPISODE 2"

2
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,223
I'm under a spell once a month.

3
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,522
Not the spell that everyone knows
from the commercial,

4
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,399
but an actual spell.

5
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,252
Oh my gosh!

6
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,758
Are you kidding me?

7
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,761
Once a month, for about seven days,

8
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,055
I live as someone else.

9
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,564
I become either gender,

10
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:58,785
or any age.

11
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,129
Even my race changes.

12
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,466
How much is this?

13
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,717
May I have it to go?

14
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,095
This is seriously delicious!

15
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,638
This was so good.

16
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,642
Thank you. Good bye.

17
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:23,935
Good bye.

18
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,996
At first I wanted to die,

19
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,748
but then I wanted to live.

20
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,794
-The Han Se-gye of today...
-...ends here.

21
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,671
-The Han Se-gye of today...
-...ends here.

22
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,632
Every face that wanted a life

23
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,509
was mine.

24
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,510
Ends here.

25
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,339
But right now,

26
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,217
I just want to disappear.

27
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,676
Oh my god. What will I do?

28
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,471
If youÂ do not answer by the time I count
to five, I will break the door.

29
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:42,805
One.

30
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,474
Two.

31
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,309
Three.

32
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,895
Four. Five.

33
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,319
Han Se-gye.

34
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,530
Are you OK?

35
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,788
Please help me.

36
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,500
Please cover me.

37
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,836
-Bring me a blanket.
-Yes.

38
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,094
Here.

39
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,817
Why did I look back at you?

40
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:41,364
There was no change of emotion
when you looked at me.

41
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:43,950
Why is that?

42
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,160
Why?

43
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,325
I don't know what's going on with you,
but you don't have to say anything.

44
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,702
I am not that interested.

45
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:31,539
So...

46
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,960
Just walk, and trust me.

47
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,610
Am I late?

48
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:04,947
Hi.

49
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,505
On the airplane, she suddenly...

50
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,840
She must be really tired.
She does this sometimes.

51
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:45,905
What's going on?

52
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,408
I'm not sure.

53
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,913
Is she Han Se-gye?

54
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,041
Probably yes.

55
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,475
Are you OK?

56
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,602
I am discovered.

57
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,187
What?

58
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,403
I'm pretty sure.

59
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,047
Good morning, Sir!

60
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,551
Sure. Good morning, Jeong.

61
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,358
How did you know it was me?

62
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,318
Are you kidding me?

63
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:09,113
I'm not.
I even parted my hair differently.

64
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,240
Your shoes.

65
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,993
Those are the shoes you made me get you
for your birthday.

66
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,121
Oh. Correct!

67
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,206
Is it fun?

68
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,042
I try to enjoy my work.

69
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,687
S has arrived! S is here!

70
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,950
Why do we have to put on our name tags?

71
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,494
Can't he memorize his direct subordinates?

72
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,580
That is not it.
Our boss is too perfect to not know.

73
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,917
Perfect? He's just pretending.

74
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,920
He just learned how to do it somewhere.

75
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,715
How was your meeting?

76
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,592
Congratulations on signing the contract!

77
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,135
It is too early to congratulate.

78
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,398
I am sorry.

79
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,943
I had to go outside,
so I took off my badge.

80
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,822
Did you change your hair, Su-jeong?

81
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,448
I almost didn't recognize you.

82
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,827
Oh, Mr. Lee?

83
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:42,123
Please report to me the routes to Russia
as soon as you can.

84
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,040
Yes.

85
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,091
Once again, our boss is perfect!

86
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:55,720
He has sharp eyes,
maybe because he is so handsome.

87
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,847
How are those two related?

88
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,600
Even Su-jeong's boyfriend wouldn't
have recognized her. But he did!

89
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,810
He is special.

90
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,271
Look how he has pet fish in his office.

91
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,731
He's so strange.

92
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,156
Why didn't you prompt me?

93
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,449
You're not a kid.

94
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,534
You know well enough.

95
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,871
I don't know well. Take care of me.

96
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,206
I'm always dangerous.

97
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,625
Just check your fish.

98
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,795
Ddolgi, Ddungy, Hochi, Sechom...

99
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,091
Do you even know if I'm correct?

100
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,260
Are you monitoring me, knowing things?

101
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:43,434
Drago, Yorong, Macho. Good morning, Mimi.

102
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,312
Did you make an appointment with Dr. Oh?

103
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,065
Room 1401 at Sunwoo Hotel,
in five days.

104
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,737
Moongchi, Kiki.

105
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,157
By the way,

106
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,369
she had someone else's voice.

107
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,830
She looked like she saw something scary.

108
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,248
Maybe she was scared of you.

109
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,834
Oh dear.

110
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:10,711
I am so scared.

111
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,297
Anyway, there's something strange
about her.

112
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,592
You know there are
a lot of strange things.

113
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,721
You're right. Nothing is strange.

114
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,556
I am the strangest one.

115
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,521
Why? Do you suddenly feel bad for me?

116
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:31,357
Do you feel compassion?
Do you want to be nice to me?

117
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,694
You left out Gangdal and Chingching.

118
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,988
Gangdal and Chingching.
Am I good now?

119
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,408
Did you know that?

120
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,369
-Han Se-gye doesn't have a kid.
-So?

121
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,246
-She just doesn't.
-Good for her.

122
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:48,791
If she did, it would have posed some risks
that we would have to take care of.

123
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,379
Shouldn't we take care of that
before a rumor spreads?

124
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,639
Has she been confirmed?

125
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:07,727
According to the stewardess,
she was Han Se-gye.

126
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:11,480
Han Se-gye? The actress?

127
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,023
The T-Road model?

128
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,276
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

129
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,486
I also confirmed the passenger list.

130
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,826
He went on a secret trip,

131
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,453
and brought back a present.

132
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,288
I didn't know you had such taste.

133
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,665
That's fun.

134
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,710
And there was a small incident
on the plane.

135
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,129
During the flight,

136
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,673
Han Se-gye suddenly went
to the bathroom and didn't come out.

137
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,927
Maybe they had a lovers' quarrel.

138
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,180
Thank you.

139
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,776
What makes her so cute and precious

140
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,737
that you had to wrap her up like that?

141
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,621
How dare you put your hands on me?

142
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,790
Let me go. Right now!

143
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,542
You bitches!

144
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,461
I belong to his majesty.

145
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,671
I am a lord's woman.

146
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,757
Lord! Lord!

147
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,261
Spare me, my lord.

148
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,555
It is me, Ok-jeong.

149
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:29,892
Your majesty.

150
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,569
Again? Aren't you tired of
your debut film?

151
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,572
Why do you open your eyes every morning?
Aren't you tired?

152
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,284
Why do you even begin
when you can never win?

153
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,120
I won't disappear even after my death.

154
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,165
I will be an evil ghost
and stay in this world.

155
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,168
I will haunt you and everyone around you.

156
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,754
It's so strange.

157
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,173
She knows who feeds her.

158
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,425
I feed her. I feed her every day.

159
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,928
And I feed you.

160
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,350
I appreciate your grace.

161
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,769
How long are you going to take money
from your friend?

162
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:18,566
Taking money?
I am being paid for working as a maid.

163
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,444
If you are,
go and replace that light bulb.

164
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:26,282
Leave it there. I'll do that
when I become a tall person.

165
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,118
You're so fortunate
to be able to grow tall.

166
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,080
Why did you change again?

167
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,583
You just changed not long ago.

168
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,717
This is the right time.
Last time was irregular.

169
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,180
Why did it have to be the ceremony day?

170
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,642
I guess the last change was
not good enough,

171
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,103
so this time is gonna be
a really dramatic one.

172
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,438
Dramatic?

173
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,023
Yes, she was discovered.

174
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,357
Oh disc...

175
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,276
What?

176
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,403
What is he calculating?

177
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,031
Why is he being so quiet?

178
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,198
Who?

179
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,869
How can he believe such a change?

180
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:15,414
Usually, people won't believe it
even though they see it.

181
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,834
They think "I must be out of my mind."

182
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,712
Right? I don't have to worry, huh?

183
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,173
Just don't be around him.

184
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,968
It's just a week.
You'll be back to normal in a week.

185
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,678
Who are you talking about?

186
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,599
JERK SEO DO-JAE

187
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,101
Wh... what?

188
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,607
You... you!

189
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,489
No!

190
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,909
Han Se-gye is not available.

191
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,161
She just went to the bathroom to wash up.

192
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,414
Yes. Please call another time.

193
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:02,378
You are crazy!
Why did you pick such a story?

194
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,923
It's over.

195
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,634
Pack up.
It really is time for you to retire.

196
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,012
Why?
Why are you mad when I did that for you?

197
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,432
You are so naive that you don't even know
what your words imply.

198
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,018
What? What is it?

199
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,646
-What?
-You would not understand anyway.

200
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,568
Anyway, why do I feel like I forgot
something important?

201
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,154
What did you forget? Feeding the dog?

202
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,781
I told you I fed her.

203
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,574
Stop barking like a dog.

204
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,706
A man?

205
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,594
She just went to bathroom to wash up.

206
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,555
Wash up?

207
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,029
Please help me.

208
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,532
Please cover me.

209
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,160
She is strange.

210
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,418
She's bothering me in every way.

211
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,420
Shall I just throw it away?

212
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,346
I called to make sure
you got home safely.

213
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,722
It doesn't mean anything.

214
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,850
So do you know or not?

215
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:24,937
Jeez!

216
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,022
Come and pick up your luggage,

217
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,273
before I throw it out.

218
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,526
My office is too small for the luggage.

219
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,072
I knew I forgot something.

220
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,699
I'm so dumb!

221
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,452
U-mi.

222
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,454
YOU U-MI

223
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,958
The person you called is not available.

224
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,835
RYU EUN-HO

225
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,838
The phone you called is turned off.

226
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,925
I'll throw it away
if you don't reply within a minute.

227
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,136
OK.

228
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:01,598
Just throw it awa...

229
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:03,600
awa...

230
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:15,863
awa...

231
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,577
Oh my!

232
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,544
I will be there within an hour.

233
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,506
30 minutes.

234
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:41,180
The number of passengers who went abroad
in the 3rd quarter increased

235
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,348
by 2.5% over the same periodÂ last year.

236
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,600
The revenue this month...

237
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,517
Come to our cafe.

238
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:49,104
...reached 82%
of the management's expectation.

239
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,564
Yes, sir.

240
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,821
It is 82%...

241
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:04,453
Then, we can reach 100%
by the end of the month, correct?

242
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,829
Of course, sir.

243
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,666
T-ROAD BUSINESS PLAN

244
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,006
What should I wear?

245
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,307
Not this. Not this either.

246
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,647
This? No...

247
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,524
Not this.

248
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,318
No.

249
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,031
This one.

250
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,210
Is this too much?

251
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,260
This face will disappear in one week.

252
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:43,719
Han Se-gye,

253
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,513
you showed up.

254
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,309
I thought you were too busy
to answer the phone.

255
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,854
You are exactly 10 minutes late.

256
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,815
Why don't you buy me coffee
since I've taken care of your stuff.

257
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,275
-Well...
-Why?

258
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,110
Can't you even pay for coffee?

259
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:01,903
That's not it.

260
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,619
Do you... know me?

261
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,794
Excuse me, I was confused.

262
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,673
I work at Han Se-gye's home.

263
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,679
Like a maid...

264
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,015
She asked me to come here.

265
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:36,104
I will bring this carrier for her.

266
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,201
Mommy!

267
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,166
This isn't a safe place to play.

268
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:57,959
Where's your mom?

269
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:12,307
By any chance...

270
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,188
are you the mother of this child?

271
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,440
Kid again!

272
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,738
I am not a mom.
I told you that I do not have a kid.

273
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,575
What will you say?

274
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,412
Don't say it. I don't have a kid.

275
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,334
Jin-young!

276
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,253
Mommy!

277
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,465
Thank you. Let's go.

278
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,261
There was a misunderstanding.

279
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,429
Misunderstanding again!

280
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,017
Excuse me.

281
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,699
Isn't this yours?

282
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,037
Give it to me. It's mine.

283
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,749
Is this really yours?

284
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,168
It is.

285
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,044
Are you sure?

286
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,212
I am sure.

287
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,304
She is Han Se-gye.

288
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,610
You startled me.

289
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,279
Hello! Thank you.

290
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:38,662
She got a new maid, again.

291
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:43,041
Even those who come
to my house everyday don't recognize me.

292
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,252
So cute.

293
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,842
Among all these people,
those who recognize me...

294
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,267
don't exist.

295
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,144
No matter what I do,

296
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,314
even if I die here right now,

297
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:07,857
no one will know who I am.

298
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,945
Why did he call my name?

299
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:21,037
Wouldn't it be natural to doubt
if I was really Han Se-gye?

300
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,624
You went where? Are you crazy?

301
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,753
You went there?

302
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,797
You're dying to be discovered,
aren't you?

303
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,966
You didn't pick up the phone.

304
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,844
Then, you should've waited
until I did.

305
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,179
You're happy with your life, huh?

306
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,514
You lack nothing, right?

307
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:41,558
You're a crazy bitch.

308
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:45,645
How dare you say such a thing toÂ someone
much older than you?

309
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,732
-That's not it.
-It's OK.

310
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:52,027
We're the same age,

311
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,945
but suddenly my face changed.

312
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,031
What's she talking about?

313
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:59,200
To tell the truth, once a month,

314
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,704
I change into someone else.

315
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,957
You are drunk!

316
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,169
You should've eaten some food
with your drinks.

317
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:12,422
It looks like she needs help.
She is drunk!

318
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,217
See?

319
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:19,095
I tell the truth, and no one believes it.

320
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,766
What can I say?

321
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,518
After convincing my boyfriend
not to leave me.

322
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:31,650
By the way, there's something
I'm dying to know.

323
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,985
Do you really have a boyfriend?

324
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:39,240
It occurred to me.

325
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:45,330
What would it be like if there's
one person who looks at me like this

326
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:50,335
and still calls me Se-gye,
besides you guys.

327
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:00,512
It's impossible, I know.

328
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:06,559
Even you, my long-time friends,
didn't know it was me.

329
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,601
U-mi. It's me.

330
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,480
U-mi.

331
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,984
-U-mi!
-Why are you doing this to me?

332
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:59,279
It's me. Please talk to me.

333
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,990
You got the wrong room.

334
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:05,869
It is me. I am Se-gye. Please, U-mi.

335
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,120
U-mi!

336
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,844
What will I do?

337
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,472
What should I do?

338
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,515
U-mi.

339
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,234
What is...

340
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,611
How is...

341
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,613
What happened...

342
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,490
Is that you?

343
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,327
Is that really you?

344
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,412
Are you kidding me?

345
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,249
I'm not!

346
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,587
U-mi, I feel it.

347
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,506
It's coming.

348
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,258
Take care of it.

349
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,346
What is it?

350
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,106
What is this?

351
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,483
Hi Eun-ho. I am Se-gye.

352
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,277
She said she would change.

353
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,572
-So you became a man...
-Yes...

354
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,991
-The legs...
-What?

355
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,409
Stop touching there.

356
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:15,206
I need to die to wake up from this dream.
See you later.

357
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,209
-This is not a dream.
-Stop.

358
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:22,463
-That's not it.
-Stop!

359
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,924
Yeah, I remember.

360
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,218
Yes.

361
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:32,098
I'm the one who wants to wake up
from this dream.

362
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,018
How will I live without you guys?

363
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:40,023
If you become a priest
and U-mi gets married,

364
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,650
how will I live alone?

365
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,193
How would you be alone?

366
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,029
You haveÂ Gging-ggang.

367
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:49,782
Gging-ggang will meet your lord
before I do.

368
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:54,078
I might get married,
but I'm not going to prison.

369
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,122
You worry too much.

370
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:02,795
It was all drunk-talk.

371
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,798
Now that I'm drunk, I'll go home.

372
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,885
The person who'll pay for this...

373
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,094
is me!

374
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,471
I'll go with you.

375
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,809
It's safe to walk alone with this face.

376
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:20,730
Please let me have freedom and romance.

377
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,067
Take some time off tomorrow and play.

378
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,902
You never have time to play
because of me.

379
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,278
Still...

380
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,822
I will fire you if you call me tomorrow.

381
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,032
Do you understand?

382
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,578
Then, three days!
I will take three days off, OK?

383
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,792
-Bye.
-Call me when you get home.

384
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:46,297
She asked you to take one day off.
Why did you take three days off?

385
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,302
HAN SE-GYE
HAN SE-GYE

386
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,404
MAID
FAST WALK, SMALL STRIDES.

387
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,743
She was not Han Se-gye.

388
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,121
She couldn't be.

389
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:21,833
But who is she?

390
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,794
Her shoe size is 7.

391
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,463
Fast and small strides.

392
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,048
Confident walk.

393
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:31,843
Hairstyle.

394
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,971
This is too common, and changes a lot.

395
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,432
Luxurious fabric.

396
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,268
Looks like designer patterns.

397
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:42,979
Necklace.

398
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,981
This is a question.

399
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:03,583
Voice.

400
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:07,962
Do you know me?

401
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,967
Please help me.

402
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:16,596
Please cover me.

403
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,851
I'll have to find out on my own.

404
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,381
Maybe I drank too much.

405
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:54,717
I'm seeing things.

406
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,266
He's not a hallucination.

407
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,066
That hurts.

408
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,085
Here.

409
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:30,586
Use this.

410
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:38,761
Thank you.

411
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:45,935
Excuse me.

412
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:56,112
I have an appointment with Han Se-gye.

413
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,740
-Excuse me?
-Is she in there?

414
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,159
You can't have an...

415
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,493
Why not?

416
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:05,246
Because I didn't hear anything about it.

417
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,624
Then, I'll call her now.

418
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,588
My phone. Where is it?

419
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,215
Come in.

420
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,260
Come in and wait.

421
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,144
OK.

422
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,377
I guess the dog is very friendly.
She seems to like everyone.

423
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,755
Don't they usually only like their owners?

424
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,133
She is very friendly.

425
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,596
It must be your day off.

426
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,598
-You drank.
-Excuse me?

427
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,226
Oh, yes...

428
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,772
Would you like to have some coffee?

429
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:15,983
It's OK. I'm not here for coffee.

430
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:19,403
-I'll call Han Se-gye.
-I can call her.

431
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:22,448
No! I will do it.

432
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,117
Just sit and wait.

433
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,302
My phone.

434
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:49,016
My phone... where is it?

435
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:53,187
Where is it? It's not here.

436
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,399
I'm going crazy.

437
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,953
I didn't drink much, but I feel sick.

438
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,166
I feel strange.

439
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:27,656
So many!

440
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,979
What are you doing there?

441
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:09,573
You have Han Se-gye's voice,

442
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,700
but are wearing the maid's clothes.

443
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:20,292
Come to think of it, those clothes,

444
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,254
aren't they too expensive
for a maid to wear?

445
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,799
This is...

446
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,217
I thought it was strange.

447
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:34,557
This is the same.

448
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,183
What are you doing?

449
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,689
You smell like alcohol.

450
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,524
The same.

451
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,322
The same.

452
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,618
Who are you?

453
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,046
Who are you?

454
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,259
You ask a stranger if she is me.

455
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,179
You ask me who I am.

456
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:20,936
You can't recognize faces, can you?

457
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,035
Who is it?

458
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,121
Which one of these people is me?

459
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,043
If I say who I am,

460
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,587
can you believe it?

461
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:58,057
So you went there all by yourself,
recklessly.

462
00:41:58,766 --> 00:41:59,975
I was not reckless.

463
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:01,977
I had a plan.

464
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,732
So you had a plan to be reckless.

465
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,652
Are you my teacher? Stop scolding me.

466
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,655
You always do things to deserve scolding.

467
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,282
She was really strange.

468
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,659
How?

469
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,994
It doesn't make sense,
and I have no reason to believe it.

470
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,080
but I feel like she's someone else.

471
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,374
I feel like she's someone else,

472
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,793
and the other person seems
like the same person.

473
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,044
And they are one person.

474
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,964
Are you talking about love?

475
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,841
It sounds like love.

476
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,303
There's no sense or reason,
but everyone looks like her.

477
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:58,117
Due to the brain damage caused
by the accident,

478
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,744
the brain pathway that connects
facial character analysis

479
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,872
and memory system was damaged.

480
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,375
I have a problem
with the memory process.

481
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:09,295
So as you suggested last time,

482
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:11,297
I depend on information and training.

483
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,633
I use secondary clues.

484
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,761
Thanks to consistent practices,

485
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,847
my recognition ability
with secondary clues is

486
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:23,100
superior to otherÂ Prosopagnosia patients.

487
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:25,311
OK.

488
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,397
It's been 10 years.

489
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:32,985
What's your opinion
of my current condition?

490
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:34,987
Specifically?

491
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:39,491
I get confused these days.

492
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:45,164
I keep seeing someone who can't be.

493
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,709
Am I getting worse?

494
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:51,337
I don't have an answer for that.

495
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,176
I'll tell you a secret.

496
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:01,889
If you can't tell with your eyes, don't!

497
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:03,557
What do you mean?

498
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:09,229
Are blind people unable to love someone?

499
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,024
Feelings come

500
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:16,403
in other ways than through eyes and brain.

501
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,322
It's more accurate that way, too.

502
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,030
Who...

503
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:09,415
Hello, Vice Chairwoman.

504
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:12,292
Mother!

505
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,256
I came here for a meeting.

506
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:19,550
Are you coming back from meeting
with Dr. Oh?

507
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,302
Yes. You got your hair cut.

508
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:27,641
I am so lucky to have a son who can tell
if I got a haircut.

509
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:29,893
I'm sorry.

510
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,562
Do me a favor, then.

511
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:34,440
2:00 p.m. today.
Meet with the daughter of Minister Joo.

512
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:37,151
-Mother.
-You probably need to go back to work.

513
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:39,153
Good luck.

514
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,698
I've got to go.
I'll be late for meeting.

515
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:00,466
VICE CHAIRWOMAN

516
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:03,886
Ju-hwan!

517
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,053
Yes.

518
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:11,351
Do well. I, Do-jae,
and Sunho Group depend on you.

519
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:12,853
Yes.

520
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:16,273
I don't mind getting hurt a million times.

521
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:19,026
But Do-jae won't get a second chance.

522
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,278
One mistake will ruin everything.

523
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,030
I understand.

524
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:24,865
Please take good care of him.

525
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,286
Who was that?

526
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,080
It was a business call.

527
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:57,397
What should I do?
I'm in big trouble.

528
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,398
What can I do?

529
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:03,695
If I drink again,
I'm not Han Se-gye anymore.

530
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,323
But I'm already not myself sometimes.

531
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:09,409
How can you not know?

532
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,329
How?

533
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,751
Why am I doing this?

534
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:18,877
What is he gonna do?

535
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,713
Is he gonna call the Police, the
National Intelligent Service, or the FBI?

536
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,592
That sounds a bit scary.

537
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,347
Delivery!

538
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,028
-Here it is.
-OK.

539
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:47,865
Wait!

540
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,158
Will you sign please?

541
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:52,786
-OK.
-Here.

542
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,126
HANKOOK DELIVERY

543
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:01,920
Please write "Dear lovely Young-soo".

544
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,091
-I forgot that I came back!
-Excuse me?

545
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:12,139
I just came back
from a long and hard trip.

546
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:14,182
I still have jet lag.

547
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:16,184
So, you can't give an autograph?

548
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,979
Of course I can!

549
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:20,856
Then...

550
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,953
"Dear lovely Young-soo"

551
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:41,585
Heart. P.S. "Be happy!"

552
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:47,925
My natural appearance is a secret
between you and me.

553
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:50,177
-Zipped!
-You got it, Young-soo?

554
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,308
Bye.

555
00:48:58,477 --> 00:48:59,311
Woo-hoo!

556
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:00,812
I'm on my way.

557
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:05,025
I said I'm on my way! She isn't a kid
who can't even cook for herself.

558
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,612
Stop swearing. I feel offended.

559
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,949
OK. I said OK!

560
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,765
Open the door.

561
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:37,849
You again.

562
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:40,852
HAN SE-GYE

563
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,439
-Who's this?
-Is she washing up again?

564
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:47,776
Why do you call me while she's
washing up? I guess you miss me so much.

565
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,152
Excuse me?

566
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,112
Can't you wait?

567
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:53,198
-I think you misunderstood.
-I understand.

568
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,534
I miss you very much.

569
00:49:58,704 --> 00:49:59,538
I love you.

570
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:00,956
Hello?

571
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:03,792
Hello?

572
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:08,088
Where were we?

573
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:14,803
No, I have nothing to say.

574
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:16,346
I agree.

575
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:26,982
You must not remember.

576
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:28,150
We've met before.

577
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,319
-Is that right?
-Yes, it is.

578
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:34,614
We said hi each other
at the Dongsung Group party.

579
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,034
Of course, I don't remember.

580
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:41,329
I'll deliver the message
from Sunho Group to my dad.

581
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:56,511
The coffee is good here.

582
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,316
Hi! Sorry. I was removing my make-up.

583
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,154
Oh, hangover soup!

584
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,116
CALL HISTORY
HAN SE-GYE

585
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,166
It looks good!

586
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,099
I came back.
Aren't you gonna say hi to me?

587
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:52,609
-Where's your phone?
-My phone?

588
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,237
I lost my phone after drinking.

589
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:01,618
If I turned into a man,
I'd so want to go to a sauna with you.

590
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:04,287
Maybe next month?

591
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:06,915
Don't even think about it, pervert!

592
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:09,543
What? Why?

593
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:14,047
Call your phone.
When I called, a man picked it up.

594
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,633
Really? Did I leave it in the cart bar?

595
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,140
Hello.

596
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:26,601
Hi, I'm the owner of the phone.
May I ask who this is?

597
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,395
I'm the owner of the handkerchief.

598
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:34,734
Eun-ho.

599
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,446
Will you really do anything for money?

600
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,240
What do you think I am?

601
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,284
What is it? I'll do anything.

602
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:44,536
Can you steal something?

603
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:47,122
What do you really think I am?

604
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:49,583
Get yourself together.

605
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:50,709
I'm a christian.

606
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:53,295
You'll be forgiven if you pray.

607
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,881
What is it now? What did you do?

608
00:52:57,257 --> 00:53:01,011
My phone has been picked up
by someone who shouldn't have it.

609
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:05,265
And my phone has stuff
that no one should see.

610
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,100
Like what?

611
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,393
My video.

612
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:09,519
Your video?

613
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,648
You're crazy, super pervert!

614
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,735
What are you talking about?
I mean my video.

615
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:18,695
The videos of my new faces.

616
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:21,656
Things like "Hello, I am Han Se-gye,
the Han Se-gye of today ends here."

617
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:25,827
OK. You locked the phone
with a password, right?

618
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,371
I did, but...

619
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:33,001
I should be the one to start the fight.

620
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:34,544
You drive.

621
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,631
-Eat first.
-Come on.

622
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:45,180
Wow, well done!

623
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:47,182
You killed it.

624
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:50,644
Thank you for your praise and support.

625
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,646
ENTER PASSWORD

626
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:55,482
INCORRECT PASSWORD

627
00:53:58,818 --> 00:53:59,819
This can't be it.

628
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:08,828
Why did she even bother locking her phone?
What did she lock?

629
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,751
He has my weakness.

630
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,128
I need to find his weakness.

631
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,297
Weakness? Like what?

632
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:22,133
He has one, which explains everything.

633
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:24,177
So what is it?

634
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:26,846
It is a long story. Too much to explain.

635
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:28,932
You just drive.

636
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:33,687
Tell me so that I can decide
if I want to be part of this or not.

637
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,042
Follow that car, now.

638
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,419
-That car?
-That one.

639
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:24,738
I'm getting out. You can go home.

640
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,781
-What are you gonna do?
-Discovery.

641
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,521
Excuse me, can I borrow that?

642
00:55:58,980 --> 00:55:59,814
Excuse me?

643
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,274
I'm here to see Seo Do-jae,

644
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:04,486
the director of Strategic Planning
or something like that.

645
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:15,038
Yes it is me. Excuse me!

646
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,331
I'll be right back.

647
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,043
Oh my, it really is her.

648
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,044
PARK DA-EUN

649
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:22,545
Excuse me.

650
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:28,718
I chose just the right blouse.

651
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:57,455
Wait a minute.

652
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:02,001
Why is the receptionist going
to the design team?

653
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:19,519
Do you have something to say,

654
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:21,062
Han Se-gye?

655
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:25,567
Stop testing me.

656
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:53,970
-I was surprised.
-Is that true?

657
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:56,264
What's this?

658
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:57,974
It is the most searched article right now.

659
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,522
Good morning, sir.

660
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:16,159
SEO DO-JAE AND HAN SE-GYE CAME BACK
FROM A SECRET TRIP

661
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:22,373
"It was confirmed that the woman who went
on the trip with him was Han Se-gye.

662
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:26,586
Han is the model of T-Road,
where Seo works.

663
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:28,421
When there was a rumor about Han,

664
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:31,007
unlike other companies,
only T-Road extended a contract,

665
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,467
which made people wonder."

666
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:34,219
You don't have to read it out loud.

667
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,763
Are you two really dating?

668
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:39,807
What do you think?

669
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,476
Clean this up.

670
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:43,853
Who? Han Se-gye?

671
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:45,688
-The media.
-OK.

672
00:58:58,952 --> 00:58:59,827
Taxi!

673
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:01,621
Taxi!

674
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:07,418
Taxi!

675
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,254
Taxi!

676
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:11,256
Hey...

677
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,550
Hey, is this real?

678
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:15,552
Wow!

679
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:17,595
REAL TIME SEARCH
SEO AND HAN SECRET TRIP

680
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:20,014
-Han Se-gye dating a chaebol?
-There's a story!

681
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:23,142
-It is big news.
-I thought she'd be different.

682
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,271
She's right there!

683
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:28,356
She's Han Se-gye!

684
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,359
-Don't go to her.
-Are you really dating him?

685
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:35,363
-Wow, it is her!
-Stop.

686
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:38,491
-Are you really going out with him?
-Is it true?

687
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,789
One, two, three!

688
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:45,433
You asked if I can believe it.

689
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,477
I'm not sure
that I can't believe it.

690
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:50,521
But it doesn't make sense.

691
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:53,900
It doesn't make sense
and there's no reason.

692
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:55,735
But to me,

693
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:59,489
in my eyes, you have always been you.

694
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:11,918
You've done this before.

695
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:14,837
Just walk and trust me.

696
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,753
It took a long time

697
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:59,340
until I recognized what I love.

698
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:02,927
Why did IÂ look back at you?

699
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:05,805
There was no change of emotion
when you looked at me.

700
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:07,765
Why is that?

701
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,358
Hey, that is Han Se-gye!

702
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:20,111
Oh, the life of a star!

703
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:23,448
Enjoy never-changing beauty!

704
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:26,200
Never-chaning beauty?

705
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:27,535
Is that today?

706
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:28,911
Yes.

707
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,497
I'm under a spell once a month.

708
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:33,791
Not a spell that everyone knows
from the commercial,

709
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:35,877
but an actual spell.

710
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,838
I become either genderÂ or any age.
Even my race changes.

711
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,257
I live as someone else.

712
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:43,342
TOP ACTRESS WHO CHANGES ONCE A MONTH,
HAN SE-GYE

713
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:47,597
What did I do so wrong?
What did I do?

714
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,557
She isn't here.
Han Se-gye already ran away.

715
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:51,267
Are you sure she's here?

716
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:53,811
-Hey!
-Pardon me, but what's your name?

717
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,062
I forget things.

718
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:59,150
Hello, I am Seo Do-jae, Director
of Strategic Planning at T-Road.

719
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:02,278
Which class will win between economy
and business?

720
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:04,238
I don't want to fight a losing battle.

721
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:06,574
If it's 17 to 1, I'd like to be
the one with 17.

722
01:03:06,657 --> 01:03:09,577
In the middle is CEO Kim Hong-woo,
on the left is Director Beak Sang-hyun.

723
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,204
On the right is Director Sung Ho-seok.

724
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,289
-It's been a while, Mr. Kim--
-Right side.

725
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:14,332
Hong-woo.

726
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:16,292
You don't recognize me?

727
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:18,836
Who...?

728
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:22,465
DIRECTOR AT T-ROAD WITHÂ PROSOPAGNOSIA
SEO DO-JAE

729
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:24,383
Aren't you gonna say hi
to your sister?

730
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:25,968
I guess you're not close to her!

731
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,679
She's more like an enemy than a sister.

732
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:30,973
I welcome your mistakes.

733
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,517
It looks like you're ready to eat me.

734
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,061
Don't you think I'm cute when I'm spicy?

735
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:36,312
One hot vanilla latte, please.

736
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:37,855
Oh, hi!

737
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:41,734
I'll make you two,
as you work for good purposes.

738
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:44,570
Young kids are too aggressive these days.

739
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:47,657
PRESIDENT OF ONEAIR,
SEO'S STEP-SISTER KANG SA-RA

740
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,826
Eun-ho, will you really do
anything for money?

741
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:51,661
What do you think I am?

742
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:54,539
-I will do anything.
-Then, take her over there!

743
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:57,208
-She looks scary.
-Don't worry. She's not as scary as me.

744
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:58,960
Run!

745
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:01,671
He is so refreshing.

746
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:05,049
Why did I not make him an entertainer?

747
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:08,344
It's not too late.
He'll go to the Cannes before I do.

748
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:10,471
What kind of man is so weak?

749
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:12,890
I just pretended to be weak,
for no reason.

750
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:15,226
FUTURE PRIEST,
HAN'S FRIEND, RYU EUN-HO

751
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,019
Do you want to be my girl?

752
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:19,981
What's the matter?
I did it because you look pretty.

753
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:22,441
You! You humiliated me.

754
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,777
You make money by smiling
in front of a camera.

755
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,237
Excuse me.

756
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,613
That bastard at the hospital...

757
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:29,824
Han Se-gye, pay my money back.

758
01:04:29,907 --> 01:04:32,618
-I 'm not going to extend the contract.
-That's gonna be a problem.

759
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,579
Your picture was taken with my money.

760
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:37,039
I suspected this, but are you really
a pervert?

761
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:39,000
She is so annoying.

762
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:41,752
-Hey, are you nervous?
-What about?

763
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:44,213
Sitting next me...
makes you nervous, right?

764
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:46,549
I told you not to talk to me.
You are interrupting.

765
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:49,969
You seem to like to be sarcastic.
Is that how you became a director?

766
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:53,014
You seem to likeÂ dramatic situations.
Is that how you became an actress?

767
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:54,265
You're a jerk.

768
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:57,268
UNEXPECTED, BOUNCING AND HEALING ROMANCE

769
01:04:57,351 --> 01:05:00,062
Han Se-gye, you showed up.

770
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,064
Do you... know me?

771
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:04,775
She is Han Se-gye.

772
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,611
I am discovered.

773
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:08,738
-What?
-Oh disc... What?

774
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:11,616
Usually, people won't believe it
even though they see it.

775
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:13,743
I getÂ confused these days.

776
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:17,038
I keep seeing someone who can't be.

777
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:19,832
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

778
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:23,336
You can't recognize faces,Â can you?

779
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:26,339
NEW, BARE, AND A LITTLE SPECIAL ROMANCE

780
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:28,507
Who do you recognize?
Do you recognize your family?

781
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:31,302
If people change their hair and clothes,

782
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:33,471
they look the same to me.

783
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:36,307
What the hell? Are you crazy?

784
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:37,683
It's not what you think.

785
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,185
-Uncover yourself.
-Mother!

786
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:42,021
Hello!

787
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:43,981
My son is ga...

788
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:45,483
-No.
-That's not it.

789
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:47,360
-Were you OK?
-Of course, not.

790
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:50,071
My elbow got scratched so bad
that I bled so much, like a liter.

791
01:05:50,988 --> 01:05:53,491
Han Se-hye, is she pretty?

792
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:55,868
She's pretty. But she's not my type.

793
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,119
What is your type?

794
01:05:57,536 --> 01:05:58,788
It's a secret.

795
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:00,498
We've been reported as a couple.

796
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:02,416
Crazy...
Why would I do such a thing with you?

797
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,543
Let's be the couple of the century.

798
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:08,631
MAN AND WOMAN
WHO CAN ONLY RECOGNIZE EACH OTHER

799
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:10,758
How did you find me?

800
01:06:11,258 --> 01:06:14,220
In my eyes, you have always been you.

801
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:16,931
It was true, So Do-jae.

802
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:21,686
You are sick, just like me.

803
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:25,106
Don't move. You might not recognize me.

804
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:26,107
That's why.

805
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:28,776
Now you believe... my weakness.

806
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:30,111
See you tomorrow.

807
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:31,904
That sounds sad.

808
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:34,907
I'm not sure if you can see me tomorrow
or not.

809
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,367
See you.

810
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:39,745
I'll recognize you, so see you.

811
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:44,625
Why do you keep acting
with that special condition?

812
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:46,877
I'm doing it so that I don't forget.

813
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:49,422
I feel like I'll forget
everything about myself.

814
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:50,840
Do I know you?

815
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:53,467
The Han Se-gye I know isn't here
anymore.

816
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:56,595
Give me a chance.Â Trust me this one time.

817
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:58,848
No, you've changed.

818
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,517
Is she that much better an actress
than me?

819
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,644
The movie is not gonna fail.

820
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:05,354
It's gonna make it to the Cannes.

821
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:07,690
Cannes!

822
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:10,026
Han Se-gye?

823
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:13,446
Do you know how it feels to be abandoned?

824
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:14,864
You sleep now.

825
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:17,533
Am I not better than her?

826
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,201
You are better.

827
01:07:19,493 --> 01:07:21,203
Say that one more time, please?

828
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:22,830
You are better.

829
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:25,082
You are the only actress...

830
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:28,085
I can recognize.

831
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:37,970
