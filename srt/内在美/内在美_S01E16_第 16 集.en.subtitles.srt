1
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:50,508
Your movie Runner  was nominated
for a Cannes Award.

2
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,801
LAST EPISODE

3
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,345
This must be special for you.

4
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:58,767
They are saying you might win
the Best Actress award.

5
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,018
What do you think?

6
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,187
This is my first visit to Cannes.

7
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,690
I'm so nervous and excited.
I can't imagine winning the award.

8
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,402
I'm just honored to be invited.

9
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:13,531
I heard the all the actors and actresses
of Runner got along well. 

10
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,741
Is that true?

11
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,534
To be honest, 

12
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:21,081
it wasn't bad.
At least we didn't pull hair and fight.

13
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,250
You are so honest.

14
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,631
Who is the most memorable actor or actress
you've worked with so far?

15
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,303
Chae Yu-ri.

16
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,640
Unfortunately, we don't see her very much
these days.

17
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:42,143
I know. Hope she is well.

18
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,783
It's OK. 

19
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:03,164
I'm sorry! I apologize!
Please don't kill me!

20
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,003
Good job!

21
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,096
Congratulations on going to Cannes.

22
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,140
What brings you here?

23
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,475
I came here to see you, of course.

24
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:27,605
You were too busy to meet me, so I came.

25
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,569
I heard your contact
with T-Road is ending soon.

26
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,240
How about modeling for Oneair?

27
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,119
I knew it.

28
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,666
-Why are you here?
-To protect the company model.

29
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,420
Are you following me?

30
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,046
I have to.

31
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:56,009
You're trying so hard to take the model
from my company.

32
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:00,013
Come on. Let's talk about this.

33
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:03,850
Go fight at home.
Bring me your proposals, please.

34
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,479
Until then, we are off.
We have another appointment.

35
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,273
I will call you.

36
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,787
You're not winning.

37
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:34,088
I know. I'm not winning.

38
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,548
Trash the flowers.

39
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,383
Why? I brought them for you.

40
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,385
That's why I'm asking.

41
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,512
Let's have lunch together.

42
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,681
I don't like flowers or lunch dates.

43
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:44,933
Hey, Jeong Ju-hwan.

44
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,685
Why do you keep coming to see me?

45
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,938
Who else would I visit?

46
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,774
Stop acting pitiful.
It doesn't work anymore.

47
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,777
If you aren't going to eat with me,
take the flowers!

48
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,694
Mr. Director!

49
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,407
Oh, the president is here, too!

50
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,702
Director Jeong, the documents
you requested are ready.

51
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,746
Please bring them to me.

52
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,081
Yes, sir.

53
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,085
Wow!

54
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:17,215
-What's that about?
-"Director Jeong." Wow!

55
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,593
-Stop it, really.
-Really! Wow!

56
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,434
I'm busy, you know.

57
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,687
OK. Work.

58
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,024
Gosh, you are getting on my nerves.

59
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,151
Then you should've eaten with me.

60
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,073
Stay healthy even when you are busy.

61
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,952
Han Se-gye is your vitamin today!

62
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:52,292
What's the side effect
of having too much vitamin?

63
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,043
You don't do anything,

64
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,296
when I work so much.

65
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,089
Then become the president.

66
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:05,221
Hello Chairman, this is Director Jeong.

67
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,973
I'm off. Keep working.

68
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,985
Why here?

69
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,488
I've always wanted to come here.

70
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,868
A guy coming here alone could be
a bit embarrassing.

71
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,287
And two guys coming here is not?

72
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,998
Both of our girlfriends are busy.

73
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,167
Let's help each other!

74
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,626
Leave if you want.

75
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,340
Wait!

76
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,801
You have a long way to go.

77
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,262
You eat dessert with your eyes.

78
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,273
What is this?

79
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,359
Now you can eat.

80
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,905
I wish my girlfriend wasn't busy.

81
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,782
The president isn't busy?

82
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,909
Well, relatively.

83
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,119
I need to approve the reports.

84
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,704
You make money easily.

85
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:16,042
My girlfriend stays up all night
trying to beat your company.

86
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,671
She is so busy reading,
she doesn't even look at me.

87
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,673
What?

88
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,803
So you're next to her
while she read her papers all night?

89
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,097
All night? Next to her?

90
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,432
And she didn't look at you?

91
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,061
I need to go to the library to study.

92
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,856
So, goodbye. It was a good dessert.

93
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,536
I need to step up my game, too.

94
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,833
Here, Gging-ggang!

95
00:06:58,876 --> 00:06:59,961
Good!

96
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,468
Here...

97
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,523
TO: AUNTIE

98
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,279
She is ignoring my text.

99
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,120
Gging-ggang.

100
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,290
I'm lonely.

101
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,005
RUNNER

102
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,466
May I ask actor Lee Sang-yun a question?

103
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,260
Who do you think was
the flower of the set?

104
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:54,140
The flower was... an actress.

105
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,393
Just looking at them make us feel happy.

106
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:01,314
Han Se-gye is so senior,
with lots of experience,

107
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,357
so she is not the flower anymore.

108
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,486
So Yun Sol did the flower role.

109
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,364
Are you jealous?

110
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,366
Excuse me?

111
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,162
You should've been the flower, too.

112
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,582
Me? How can a man be a flower?

113
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,292
Oh, it's not hard.

114
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,295
You just need to shut up
and have a bright smile.

115
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:27,507
That'll make everyone happy
while shooting scenes.

116
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:28,799
Excuse me?

117
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,511
As you keep yapping,
I want you to shut up.

118
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,598
Is that so hard to understand?

119
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,269
You be the flower.

120
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,230
We will do the acting.

121
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,231
OK.

122
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,455
As you keep yapping,
I want you to shut up.

123
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,209
Your sister just made a scene again.

124
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:11,384
FROM: GRANDPA

125
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,389
-Hi, Grandpa.
-Why's our stock price going down?

126
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,474
I'll take care of it ASAP.

127
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,396
Oh my goodness! Oh my!

128
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,439
That was a live broadcast!

129
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,984
What did I care if the broadcast was live?

130
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,362
Good job. You must be so proud!

131
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,739
Of course, you're proud of me.

132
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,285
Please! I can't help it!

133
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,496
I tell myself to be patient,
but my mouth starts moving.

134
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,166
You must be trending now!

135
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,168
Oh, look at this!

136
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,046
"Han Se-gye,"
"Han Se-gye bad relations,"

137
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,299
"Han Se-gye... in love"?

138
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,593
In love? With who?

139
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,760
With Seo Do-jae?

140
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:57,888
It says

141
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:01,350
you dated Lee Sang-young
while shooting the film

142
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:05,104
and became sour because you broke up
with him after filming.

143
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,440
That's crazy! What do they think I am?

144
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,613
-Oh, dear.
-Jeez.

145
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:17,158
Sure, a scandal covers another scandal.

146
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,620
It's so you. It is.

147
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,537
Give it to me.

148
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,709
Reporter Park!

149
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:28,961
Well, that is...

150
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,424
Reporter... do you need anything?

151
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,425
Cut it out!

152
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,219
She was out of her mind...

153
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,603
LOVE BECOMES REAL?

154
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,854
Is this why?

155
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,650
Was she not busy? Was she avoiding me?

156
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:54,987
Did I get dumped?

157
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,918
-Ta-da!
-Han Se-gye!

158
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,216
Oh my Gging-ggang! How are you?

159
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,306
What?

160
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,810
-What?
-What about me?

161
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:26,769
What?

162
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,699
What's up with that rumor?

163
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:40,908
You can't tell?

164
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,828
I knew it. I've been dumped.

165
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,042
Look closely.

166
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,715
Ah, that's you from the other time.

167
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,091
Yes, that's me.

168
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:02,930
Sorry. I'm blinded by love.

169
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,766
Fine. Apology accepted.

170
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,603
This is not right.

171
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,648
When an actress is so good,

172
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,567
love rumors can happen.

173
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,028
Dating an actress,
you can't even handle such rumors?

174
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,996
But now that I think about it,

175
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,749
a real relationship doesn't
even get noticed.

176
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,752
Have you been in a real relationship?

177
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,215
Have you?

178
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,718
Have you seen
my phone's background photo?

179
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:41,844
Look at this.

180
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,013
The collection of the ones I like.

181
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:47,266
My boyfriend and Gging-ggnag.
This is great!

182
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,852
Who is that man?

183
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,188
I'm hungry.

184
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,982
Do you have anything to eat?

185
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,525
Han Se-gye.

186
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,153
I have no food.

187
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,243
Is this enough?

188
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,078
Shall I make ramen?

189
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,205
Oh no.

190
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,333
I should be on a diet.
I have to wear a dress.

191
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,418
Oh, I'm filming a new movie soon.

192
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,669
Again?

193
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,508
Why? You asked for a new movie.
Don't you like it?

194
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,886
I mean... I like it.

195
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,014
-But...
-So, you like it!

196
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:31,352
I haven't starred in a romcom in a while.
I'm nervous.

197
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,687
If it's a romantic film,

198
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,689
will there be kissing?

199
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,858
Of course.

200
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,486
-Of course?
-Did you finish eating?

201
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,738
If you are done, read with me.

202
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,157
Here, from page 30.

203
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,829
... HE KISSES HER

204
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,542
You didn't mean anything to me.

205
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,169
You are like a fleeting wind.

206
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:02,132
How can love change?

207
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,261
Don't be silly. I've never loved you.

208
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,814
What's the next line?

209
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,156
This is the next line.

210
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:31,996
Such a pro.

211
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,123
Are you sure?

212
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,543
There's one more kiss.

213
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,797
It says "He kisses her."

214
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,092
I knew it. I made a big mistake.

215
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,135
It's OK.

216
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,262
-Concentrate. Focus!
-It's OK. 

217
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,347
CALL IT A NIGHT

218
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,480
Am I not pretty?

219
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,357
Why do you ask?

220
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,151
Because you're doing that.

221
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,028
You are pretty.

222
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,447
I'm doing to to make you even prettier.

223
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,074
I knew it. I'm not pretty.

224
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,870
Gosh.

225
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,872
If you continue,
I'm going home.

226
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,958
I knew it. You're going home
because I'm not pretty.

227
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,670
Oh, you are so pathetic!

228
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,964
And ugly!

229
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,257
Look who's talking.

230
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,223
By the way, that time...

231
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,935
when you touched my face...

232
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,979
The face you touched

233
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,773
and the one you're looking at,

234
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,191
how are they different?

235
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,319
-Are they similar?
-I don't know.

236
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,615
How would I know by just touching?

237
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,827
I just... wanted to touch your face.

238
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,455
-Oh my.
-I know!

239
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,999
It's OK if the intention isn't discovered.

240
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,459
Your dark intention!

241
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,755
I'll have to show you...

242
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,633
my dark intention.

243
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,760
It's OK. You don't have to.

244
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,805
-It's fine.
-What?

245
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,140
-OK,--
-You said I had dark intentions.

246
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,725
-Fine.
-I haven't started.

247
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,227
Lie down and look up.

248
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,145
OK. Lie down and look up.

249
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,816
OK.

250
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,328
Sleep more if you're tired.

251
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,588
After I say goodbye.

252
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,884
If you are bored alone,
come to work with me.

253
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,764
I have to go somewhere, too.

254
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,475
I need to meet someone.

255
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,354
-That's not right.
-What?

256
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,398
It has to go this way.

257
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,650
Who are you meeting?

258
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,152
Someone.

259
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,821
Are you meeting the actor?

260
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,781
From the film?

261
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,533
That's not it.

262
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,202
I'm going to meet a girl I know.

263
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,550
Did you dump my brother?

264
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,053
No way.

265
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,804
Right?

266
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:41,560
Anyway, your profession is
not an easy one.

267
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,646
The rumors never end.

268
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,773
Precisely.

269
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:49,651
I don't even like younger men. Why are the
rumors about them?

270
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,071
Younger men.

271
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,158
Is that why?

272
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:58,702
Why?

273
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,370
Have a problem with Eun-ho?

274
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,998
He's too considerate.

275
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:08,170
Don't you call any time,
if you like someone?

276
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,006
He doesn't call,
thinking I might be busy.

277
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,218
He only calls me
when I'm done with work.

278
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,597
I can't always talk about it either...

279
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,435
Are you bragging right now?

280
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:27,439
No, I'm really bothered.

281
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,820
I don't have friends I can tell this to.

282
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,697
So I called you.

283
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,618
You called a busy person
for advice about love.

284
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,456
That's just how he is.

285
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,751
-He is nice and kind to everyone--
-Don't say that.

286
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,965
I have trauma about him being
kind to everyone.

287
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,383
And...

288
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,469
he smiles at everyone.

289
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,473
I feel so frustrated.

290
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,269
He shouldn't smile at everyone!

291
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,396
He needs a lesson!

292
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,816
CRIMINAL CASES

293
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:35,924
Excuse me.

294
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,469
Well...

295
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,848
Oh, I have a girlfriend.

296
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:43,807
Excuse me?

297
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,186
I'm sorry.

298
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,484
I mean... you dropped this.

299
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,363
What's he thinking in the library?

300
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:08,749
Excuse me.

301
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,877
You dropped something.

302
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,965
Your charms. You dropped your charms.

303
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,343
Do you have a man?

304
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,429
She does.

305
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,264
Oh, sorry.

306
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,646
-Are you the legendary Ryu Eun-ho?
-Leave.

307
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,189
It's an honor.

308
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,776
Honor, my foot!

309
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,034
Why are you pouting?

310
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,744
I'm not pouting.

311
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,332
Is it my fault that I'm charming?

312
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,460
It's not my fault.

313
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,603
We're here!

314
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,817
Now that I have to get out,

315
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,194
I feel sorry for pouting.

316
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,074
So you were pouting!

317
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,622
You always pick me up
and drop me off like this.

318
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,708
Even when you're tired.

319
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,670
I'm not doing this for you.

320
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:41,300
I'm doing this for me,
so don't worry.

321
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,844
And now...

322
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,722
I won't be able to do this
for a while.

323
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,598
What?

324
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:50,892
Why not?

325
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,353
I'm too busy.

326
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,317
So...

327
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:12,539
-What's this?
-Don't feel burdened. It's a used car.

328
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,542
My grandpa likes to give me cars.

329
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,085
I have many cars.

330
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,588
You know how to drive, right?

331
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,008
If I can't pick you up,
you can drive yourself.

332
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:24,926
Wow.

333
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:29,389
I had my secretary park the car
over there.

334
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,853
What are you doing?

335
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,521
Getting out?

336
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,358
OK... I am.

337
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,499
Go now.

338
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:57,793
OK.

339
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,030
By all counts,

340
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,325
I met an incredible girl.

341
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,544
-Hello?
-You come here, right now!

342
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:46,591
How dare you make a woman wait
for your call?

343
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,469
Can't you call more often?
What did I teach you?

344
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,430
That's not it...

345
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:54,307
She is always so busy...

346
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,893
Shut it! How dare you make excuses?

347
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,228
What did I teach you?

348
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,730
Do it right, OK?

349
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,607
Who said you can smile?

350
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,775
Smile?

351
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,278
At anyone?

352
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,281
You are out of your mind!

353
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:12,993
If you were my man, I would have
wiped that smile off your face.

354
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,995
I can't help it. I smile a lot.

355
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,038
Smile a lot?

356
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,790
Get it right.

357
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,168
Did you smile at us?
You smile at money.

358
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:24,880
OK. Let's say I stopped smiling.

359
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,883
Even if I don't smile,
people still like me.

360
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,677
He still needs a lesson.

361
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,596
He needs the thinking chair.

362
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,389
Where is the stick? 

363
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,392
My arms are up. Sorry.
Don't hit me.

364
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,438
You're worse than Gging-ggang.

365
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:56,244
I thought you were too busy to eat.
What brings you here?

366
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,456
Tell me the truth.

367
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,875
You can't be serious as you hold a puppy.

368
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,335
Is there another girl?

369
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:07,631
-What do you mean?
-I was right. You're mad at me.

370
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,383
Maybe I'm mad because it was so absurd.

371
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,260
Don't even think of denying it.

372
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,805
They wanted to report it with a picture
and I took care of it.

373
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:16,932
A picture?

374
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,818
Ah... this?

375
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,403
"Ah... this?"

376
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,282
Wow, you are so calm.

377
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:40,622
That is why Han Se-gye is meeting
another man, right?

378
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,958
-That's not it.
-Then why is she here?

379
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:46,461
A-ha! I got it.

380
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,464
You can't break up because of this puppy!

381
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,218
She sure is cute.

382
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,803
I said that's not it.

383
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:06,690
It's hard for me to speak to you
about this.

384
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,402
Yes, I've heard
about what you're going to say.

385
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,988
So, you heard.

386
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:17,492
I think the president cheated
on her first.

387
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,287
Maybe Han Se-gye tried to strike
with the actor.

388
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,746
That's not it.

389
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,375
Maybe she didn't. But I think
the president cheated on her.

390
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,419
Oh my gosh!
I'm sorry on his behalf.

391
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:33,633
I got a photo of him meeting
another woman...

392
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:34,551
Another woman?

393
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,430
Maybe her hair is about this long

394
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:41,683
and she's about this tall?

395
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:43,935
So you know!

396
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:48,398
As our president is good-looking
in many ways...

397
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,275
I apologize.

398
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,695
Let's get this straight.

399
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,656
Se-gye is as fine looking as him!

400
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:02,704
I know. So that's why I'm worried
that she might have been hurt.

401
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:06,041
Why do you keep making Se-gye the victim?

402
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,376
Sorry.

403
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,420
I should've been more considerate

404
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:13,131
and picked better words. Bad mouth!

405
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:17,302
We should make your situation
the priority, right?

406
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,888
-I said that it is not true.
-I understand.

407
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:23,266
I also sincerely hope that it is not true.

408
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,019
You are driving me crazy!

409
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,481
I wish I could tell you the truth.

410
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,650
You don't need to say it.

411
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,778
I understand it must be hard. So...

412
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,948
I came up with a clever idea
for those two.

413
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,325
A clever idea?

414
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,204
I'm asking for your cooperation.
It's been a while.

415
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,081
Cooperation?

416
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,836
You are here, president!

417
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,132
The house-warming party was unexpected,
so I didn't have time to buy anyth--

418
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,389
But I did get something.

419
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,184
Welcome!

420
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,937
Was it hard to find my place? Come in!

421
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,192
To your left.

422
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:26,913
Come and sit.

423
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,418
Why are you late?

424
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,544
Ouch.

425
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,879
Why did you invite me late?

426
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:38,800
Wow, this is a ruse.

427
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:42,887
You set up a plan to get presents
from everyone.

428
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,182
-What?
-You don't need to know.

429
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,685
-Congrats!
-Congrats!

430
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,103
Thank you!

431
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,651
You said your dream was to buy a house.

432
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,236
Your promotion made it so.

433
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,864
Do you give him a big salary?

434
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:04,075
I gave him a raise
every time something happened.

435
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,410
I'm so envious.

436
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:07,287
Do you want a raise, too?

437
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:10,915
No, I don't know
what you'll ask for in return.

438
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:15,253
She once asked me to steal something.

439
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,882
-Steal?
-Not really.

440
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:23,678
I just asked him get my phone
back from someone as a joke.

441
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,054
Oh, that!

442
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,015
It wasn't a joke.

443
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,934
She was very serious!

444
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,273
She said you had her phone,

445
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,108
so I had to steal it from you.

446
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,402
So did you?

447
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:43,323
By the way, why did you have her phone?

448
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,449
That's not it.

449
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:48,328
She lost it and I was just keeping it...

450
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,579
That's in the past.

451
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,706
We fought a lot about it.

452
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:58,963
Are you happy?

453
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,509
I think my plan worked.

454
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,677
They look really good together.

455
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:08,556
Overcoming difficulties strengthened
the relationship.

456
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,934
Hey, I said that's not it.

457
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,519
I don't need more trouble.

458
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,397
Well, by the way...

459
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:20,318
As we're all gathered here,
I have something to say.

460
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:21,694
Here.

461
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,157
I'm getting married.

462
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,621
What do you want for a wedding gift?

463
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:34,040
-Washer and dryer...
-Congratulations!

464
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,250
A refrigerator...

465
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:36,918
Congrats!

466
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,002
A house...

467
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,215
KANG HAN-UL & YOU U-MI

468
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,678
- A car...
-Congratulations!

469
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,472
-Hold on.
-Why?

470
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,391
Why don't you congratulate me?

471
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:54,143
Why are you making up such a big thing?

472
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,104
You can't make up for this later.

473
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:01,568
Do you want to get beaten
in front of your girlfriend?

474
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,780
Oh, don't worry about me.

475
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,157
I'm OK when it comes to friendships.

476
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,411
I met U-mi's boyfriend.

477
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:13,913
-What?
-He's fine.

478
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,291
For real?

479
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,877
Fine? Did you say fine?

480
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,381
-He is so handsome!
-Why aren't you showing him to me?

481
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:26,593
Ah! The man I happened to meet last time?

482
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,137
Oh, that person?

483
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,305
Ah.

484
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,850
Why? Why aren't you showing him to me?

485
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,482
Here you go!

486
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,819
Bring me luck!

487
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:47,864
No luck!

488
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:50,742
You should've chosen that card.

489
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:00,835
She's lucky.

490
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,675
Han Se-gye, pay me double!

491
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,636
Go easy on me, OK?

492
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,472
Four Gos! 

493
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,015
You're so tough!

494
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,436
Are you all one team?

495
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,480
Did you mark the cards or what?

496
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,690
Seo Do-jae!

497
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,276
Bring me my hammer.

498
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,195
Where is it?

499
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:32,325
You all have betting money, right?

500
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,828
Stop her no matter what.

501
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:39,165
If she wins again, we will go bankrupt.

502
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,125
-I can do it.
-You can do it!

503
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,390
-Ryu Eun-ho.
-Yes?

504
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,183
-Do you have cash?
-I do.

505
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,685
That's mine. Gimme it.

506
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,396
Hammer!

507
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,316
Seo Do-jae!

508
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,861
I miss you so much.

509
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,531
I can't help it. Just hang in there.

510
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:16,035
But I miss you so much.

511
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,330
I feel the same way.

512
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:23,543
When can I see you?

513
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,253
I know it's hard.

514
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,088
I'll be there soon.

515
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,798
I'm trying.

516
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,092
Seo Do-jae.

517
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,721
Promise me you will come back.

518
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:35,638
OK.

519
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,266
Hey.

520
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,061
He just went to get more drinks!

521
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,063
Come back soon.

522
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,441
Come back now.

523
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,776
Life is so cruel.

524
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:54,449
Why does it separate us like this? Why?

525
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:58,369
You're embarrassing me
in front of Kang Sa-ra.

526
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,750
I miss you, Ryu Eun-ho.

527
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,212
You two make me sick

528
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:09,839
and scared.

529
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,094
Tell me real honestly.

530
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,180
You've met another girl!

531
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,015
Did you, big brother?

532
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,183
No.

533
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,685
It was the day Se-gye changed.

534
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,228
That's why he does this.

535
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,772
Oh, that day!

536
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:28,441
His overreacting is driving me nuts.

537
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,569
Be careful, will you?

538
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:35,490
You two hang out like that?
Of course there is a witness.

539
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:38,159
What are you two talking about?

540
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,244
Oh the truth is...

541
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:45,083
Se-gye changes her face once a month.

542
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:46,667
Oh!

543
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,587
She hasn't changed recently.

544
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,465
-It's been about two months, right?
-Yes.

545
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,383
Just like last time.

546
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,845
You two are very drunk!

547
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,723
Gosh, they are so weak. 

548
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:04,310
Why did they begin drinking
in the first place?

549
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,188
Han Se-gye!

550
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:11,943
Oh Seo Do-jae, you are bad.
What took you so long?

551
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:17,365
Sorry, the traffic light wouldn't change.

552
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:21,119
-We're back.
-The traffic light...

553
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,623
Buy a traffic light tomorrow.

554
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,793
Did you miss me?

555
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,170
Not really.

556
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,797
What a mess, a disaster.

557
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,174
-Do you understand?
-Sounds good!

558
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,759
I'll never be late.

559
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,262
Buy me an elevator, too.

560
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:42,306
Elevator? This is a total disaster.

561
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,059
Everyone go home now. The party's over.

562
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,200
When will you be done today?

563
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,745
I don't know. I'll call you when I'm done.

564
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,082
Or not.

565
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,047
OK.

566
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,441
Excuse me. Take this...

567
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,277
You're like this drink.

568
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,121
Still got it!

569
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,674
-Get in.
-Huh?

570
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:03,512
Get in. We have somewhere to go.

571
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,099
Not with that.

572
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,727
Leave it there.

573
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,411
-Fasten your seat belt.
-OK.

574
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,810
Please allow me to marry your son.

575
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:51,769
What?

576
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,985
No, mom, that's not it.

577
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,279
What are you talking about?

578
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,906
He is too handsome to walk around freely.

579
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,533
I can't let him.

580
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,952
I want to make an official contract.

581
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:11,872
I mean...

582
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,542
an official promise.

583
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,460
Well...

584
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,714
I could let him marry you,

585
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:24,635
but we have to know what you do at least.

586
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,638
Oh, my job.

587
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,558
My job is...

588
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,561
chaebol, shall we say?

589
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:36,897
-Is chaebol a job?
-Chaebol!

590
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,859
I will make sure
he doesn't have to lift a finger.

591
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:44,071
I will make his dream come true.

592
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,698
His dream? To be a priest?

593
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,284
Why are you talking about his dream?

594
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:49,785
I mean...

595
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,915
We will be bride...

596
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,338
and groom.

597
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:05,217
Ah! What a relief. I was confused.

598
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:10,181
Wow. I totally support this!

599
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,143
Kang Sa-ra.

600
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,191
I support it, too.

601
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,633
Thank you for your clear answer
to my suggestion.

602
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,760
That was a satisfactory deal.

603
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:33,389
I will keep my promise
for the rest of my life.

604
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,727
Please continue to look after me.

605
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,161
Look ahead. Keep smiling.

606
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,328
Good!

607
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,164
Bright smile. Good.

608
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,040
Stay still. Slight smile.

609
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,333
Slight gaze.

610
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,461
OK! Good.

611
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,880
-I'll check the photos and come back.
-OK.

612
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,133
-You must be tired.
-I'm fine.

613
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,843
-Where is it?
-Did you get it?

614
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,637
Han Se-gye, follow me for a sec.

615
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,514
-Huh?
-There's something for you.

616
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:17,683
OK.

617
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,189
What is it?

618
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,358
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

619
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:35,743
Han Se-gye, be happy.
From your boyfriend Seo Do-jae.

620
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,995
The rumor...

621
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,998
must have upset him a lot.

622
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,417
Oh, dear.

623
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:48,005
So I need to make a call, thanks to this.

624
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:56,514
Reporter Park,
please don't publish anything.

625
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,140
Please...

626
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:40,683
FROM: AUNTIE

627
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,564
Hello?

628
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,108
Go on a date with me,

629
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,859
Mr. Han Se-gye's boyfriend.

630
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,111
Now?

631
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,154
The weather's beautiful.

632
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,198
I will pick you up. Wait there.

633
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,419
Are you OK? 

634
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:51,837
Wait a minute.

635
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,757
I'm sorry.

636
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,052
Take your time.

637
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:06,435
Are you OK?

638
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,395
Here you go.

639
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,650
You are OK, right? Be careful!

640
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,444
Wait a second.

641
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:20,449
What's your name? Thank you so much.

642
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,620
-Han Se-gye.
-What?

643
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:27,706
My name is Han Se-gye.

644
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:29,875
Han Se-gye.

645
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,003
Thank you so much, Han Se-gye.

646
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:50,312
Why me?

647
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,608
Why does it have to be me?

648
00:44:57,444 --> 00:45:00,030
I resented it for so long.

649
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:04,076
It was an honor to work with you.

650
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,496
The honor is mine.

651
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,715
Now I realize

652
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:22,302
I actually resented
so many versions of me.

653
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:30,018
Destiny has been teaching me.

654
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:35,482
It had to be me.

655
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:43,824
Those many faces had to come to me
for a reason.

656
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:51,165
So now it's time to love...

657
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:23,572
myself,

658
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:29,286
and you.

659
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:13,413
You said you dreamt about a woman
in a red dress.

660
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,249
So I prepared this for you.

661
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:20,420
Are you really going to wear that
to Cannes?

662
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:21,421
Yes.

663
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,260
Why, is it bad?

664
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,305
This will not do.
I need to buy a ticket, too.

665
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,601
You're too dangerous.

666
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,020
If you go like that,

667
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,815
it'll be dangerous for the world.

668
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:41,775
Seriously?

669
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:45,571
Oh, Han Se-gye is such a bad person.

670
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,030
I'm so guilty.

671
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,868
Is your dress uncomfortable?

672
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,704
No, not really. Why?

673
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:56,874
Since you're wearing it,
I want to take you somewhere.

674
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:12,764
What's this?

675
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:15,684
When did you prepare this? What for?

676
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,060
A promise.

677
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:21,648
I feel like something will happen
if you wear that to Cannes.

678
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,249
You can run away if you want.

679
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:25,003
This is your last chance to run.

680
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,255
I won't run away.

681
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:29,800
I can't run away.

682
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,551
I'm glad we're doing this.

683
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:59,663
If we are making a promise,

684
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,999
shouldn't you have prepared a speech?

685
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:08,130
-Here I go.
-Go ahead.

686
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:11,842
Are you confident?

687
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,595
We'll get old together.

688
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,724
One day, if you become young again,

689
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:21,435
will you stay with me?

690
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,273
If you become a lot older than me,

691
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:30,444
will you not give up?

692
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,073
I'm confident.

693
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:38,535
So put it on.

694
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,638
I will buy the real wedding bands.

695
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:04,686
Even though this is practice,
we should do everything.

696
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:05,729
Huh?

697
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,482
We should go on a honeymoon.

698
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:23,700
Let's...

699
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:26,745
break up.

700
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:32,459
Leave me.

701
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:45,305
I don't like you.

702
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,809
From when I first met you,

703
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:52,145
and the second time we met,

704
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,524
and all along.

705
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:01,196
All I hear is that you love me.

706
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:17,504
You've done this before.

707
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,757
Bet your life and trust me.

708
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,774
Do you remember that time?

709
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:39,985
Which time?

710
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,612
A long time ago, at my home,

711
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:46,241
when I asked you to find me
in the picture.

712
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,076
Ah...

713
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:53,707
Who is it? Among these people,
which one am I?

714
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,252
Here.

715
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:59,296
I was really curious.

716
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,381
How did you know?

717
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:04,175
Easy.

718
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:13,226
You had a solo picture in the same dress
outside of your room.

719
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:16,855
Wow.

720
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:18,690
I didn't even think about it.

721
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:20,942
What about the time in the elevator?

722
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,404
Do you have anything to say, Han Se-gye?

723
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:27,741
That time... I guessed.

724
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:29,409
Really?

725
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,328
You looked so suspicious.

726
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:36,333
You were the only one who would do
such a suspicious thing to me.

727
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:40,462
I thought only you would make it
so dramatic.

728
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:42,047
What if you were wrong?

729
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:45,300
-Then I could've apologized.
-It's that simple?

730
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:48,887
What would happen? I'm Seo Do-jae
and that was my territory.

731
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:51,389
Wow, you are...

732
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,892
a real scammer!

733
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,728
Scam? That was fate.

734
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:04,235
I have something to ask, too.

735
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,406
Why don't you return my kerchiefs?

736
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,831
Here, use this.

737
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:21,461
In the hospital, in the alley,
and at the door.

738
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,089
I gave you three.

739
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:26,424
Have you been counting?

740
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,551
They were expensive.

741
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:31,638
I'm not going to return them to you.

742
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:55,954
Han Se-gye.

743
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:01,167
Yes?

744
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,294
I love you.

745
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:21,456
I love you, too.

746
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:53,446
Will you be OK when you go to Cannes?

747
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,324
Won't it be that day?

748
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:58,159
I think it will be OK.

749
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:01,496
It's strange these days.
The day comes very irregularly.

750
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,457
Sometimes it's once
every two or three months.

751
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:07,544
Wow.

752
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:10,171
Maybe I'll get better?

753
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,839
It's not impossible.

754
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:15,051
Some things that come suddenly
also go away suddenly.

755
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:16,094
Is it ready?

756
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,399
Today's Han Se-gye...

757
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:30,900
Today's Seo Do-jae...

758
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,277
-ends here.
-ends here.

759
01:02:52,393 --> 01:02:53,352
I love you.

760
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:55,062
I love you, too.

761
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:19,605
