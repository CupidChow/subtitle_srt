1
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:58,600
Mom?

2
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,773
I knew it.

3
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,026
It's not that... Oh my goodness...

4
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,825
Yes, your mom is here.

5
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,079
You!

6
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,789
Don't blame him. Blame me.

7
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,540
Son-in-law Seo?

8
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,959
Don't take it seriously.

9
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,544
Yes, mother-in-law.

10
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,588
Mother-in...

11
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,133
Since when did she become
your mother-in-law?

12
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,843
Do you have another daughter?

13
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,185
"EPISODE 10"

14
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:46,397
The thing is... in the beginning,
we pretended to be in a relationship.

15
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:49,526
And we stopped pretending

16
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,113
by sending out a media report,
but then we started dating for real.

17
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,949
What are you talking about?
What's so complicated?

18
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:01,287
Simply speaking, I love Han Se-gye.

19
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:10,046
Now I understand.
My daughter is all good, but shy.

20
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:15,593
Even when she speaks nonsense
out of shyness,

21
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,596
please summarize the real meaning,
just like you did now.

22
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,016
-Mom.
-I won't disappoint you.

23
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:26,062
If you are curious about anything,
you can ask me anything.

24
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,566
Ask what? I just wanted to
have a drink together.

25
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,942
Mom!

26
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,535
Yes.

27
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,210
What do you think of my mom?

28
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:56,426
Her laugh is high-pitched,
her voice is soft, and mid-low tone.

29
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,846
She is positive,
she has beautiful fingers,

30
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,641
and she walks just like you.

31
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,356
I'm sorry to put you in this situation
so suddenly.

32
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,235
Oh, and she and I have
something in common.

33
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,323
We both love you so much.

34
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:25,580
Good night.

35
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,004
Han Se-gye!

36
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,017
We weren't done before.

37
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:57,862
Oh my. He's a pro.

38
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,454
Did you kiss?

39
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,459
No... we didn't.

40
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,628
Then what was that before?

41
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:22,387
It... was... becasue I tipped over.

42
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,515
You should have kissed by now.

43
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,017
You're pathetic.

44
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,728
What kind of mom are you?

45
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,023
When did you kiss dad?

46
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,735
I kissed him before we started dating.

47
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,240
You were so impudent!

48
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,539
How did you first meet?

49
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,083
A friend introduced us.

50
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:56,713
Why did you want to date Dad?
Did you fall in love at first sight?

51
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,632
No way.

52
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,014
I wasn't that interested,
but he kept asking until I gave in.

53
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,225
What was it like dating him?

54
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,769
It was kind of sweet,

55
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,647
and it kind of made my heart race.

56
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,363
Why did you want to get married?

57
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,326
I liked the "kind of" part.

58
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,038
If it gets too hot, it will boil over,

59
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,999
or get burnt at the bottom.

60
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:38,546
I thought we would have
unchanging lives.

61
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,632
But you couldn't.

62
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,431
It must've been hard for you.

63
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,146
Daughter!

64
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,148
Yes?

65
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,733
You can do it.

66
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:03,112
Even though I couldn't, you can.

67
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:08,826
Aren't you going home?
You said you need to water the plants.

68
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,622
Is that a big deal now?
I don't care if they all die.

69
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,459
You are the best thing that I raised.

70
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,644
-Free coffee!
-Thank you.

71
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,024
How do you know my payday?

72
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,404
Don't you have filming?
Did you quit your work for love?

73
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,364
Is it good to have a rich boyfriend?

74
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,366
-Ask one thing at a time.
-OK.

75
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,036
She got caught by her mom.

76
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,580
-Her lukewarm relationship!
-Hey!

77
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,833
You get discovered all the time.

78
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,920
-Why don't you just reveal everything?
-Talk about yourself!

79
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,005
What's it like to have a rich girlfriend?

80
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,674
She is not my girlfriend!

81
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:09,595
These lukewarm couples have
so many things to say.

82
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,227
Hi, darling!

83
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,521
Did you sleep well?

84
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,694
Of course I can see you.
I'm not busy these days.

85
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,239
Did you hear her phone ring?
I don't think I did.

86
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,409
Maybe she's pretending
to talk to her boyfriend.

87
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,286
I will call you. OK!

88
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:38,374
It was on vibration mode.

89
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,378
Did you hear her phone vibrate?

90
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:48,301
I should keep doing supporting roles
to support your love life.

91
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:52,305
I would like that as a woman,
but not as the president.

92
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:57,393
Not being too busy is good.
I can hang out with you guys, like this.

93
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,105
Excuse me, I have to work.

94
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,345
Director, did you get married
without telling me?

95
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,597
Why? Is there a media report?

96
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,392
No, there's no media report,
but there is a mother-in-law.

97
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,688
Your mother-in-law,
who is looking for son-in-law Seo.

98
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,539
I don't know what you like and dislike,

99
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,915
so I prepared some of everything.

100
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,751
Is this too much?

101
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,256
I should treat you to a meal...

102
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,717
No. I wanted to do this.

103
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,261
Enjoy your meal.

104
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,221
OK.

105
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,321
It's good.

106
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,201
I will cook more for you another time.

107
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:39,620
So...

108
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,959
please take good care of Se-gye.

109
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,424
Do you have time after the meal?

110
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,011
Since the food was so good,

111
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,055
it's my turn to give you a treat.

112
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,143
Now you're asking me
to do this kind of work.

113
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,436
-Ju-hwan.
-Yes?

114
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,687
I will give you a bonus.

115
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,856
Just smile.

116
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,692
-Mom!
-Jeez, you scared me.

117
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,236
-Did you go to his office?
-Yes.

118
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,740
What? Can't I visit him?

119
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:03,829
OK. It's fine that you visited him.
It's not fine, but let's say it is.

120
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,456
But what is all that?

121
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,170
These are... Why?

122
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,840
I brought him aÂ lunchbox
and he got these to thank me.

123
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,093
Why did you do that?

124
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,054
-Stop yelling.
-How can I not yell?

125
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,308
Why can't I accept what my son-in-law buys
for me? When will I do that?

126
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,727
Why do you call him son-in-law?
Who is your son-in-law?

127
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:30,439
He's already lost so much since he met me.
Why are you adding to it?

128
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,816
Listen to yourself.

129
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,819
What did he lose? Where is he going
to find someone like you?

130
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,822
He should thank you.
You don't lack anything.

131
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,283
You don't understand. You just don't.

132
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,452
-I don't know why my mom did that.
-Did what?

133
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,495
Why did she visit your office?

134
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,123
I liked it. The food was delicious, too.

135
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,042
I'm sure a lot of people saw.

136
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,754
Sorry if I made you struggle.

137
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,923
I did not struggle. And the food was good.

138
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,302
I guess you really liked the food.

139
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,138
I liked the food,

140
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,349
and I liked giving presents to the mother
of the woman I love.

141
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:49,393
That is...

142
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,854
Do you feel better now?

143
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:53,647
No.

144
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,399
No?

145
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,526
I'm not even close to feeling better.

146
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,237
-So, we should meet tomorrow.
-Suddenly?

147
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,324
From morning until night.

148
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:09,497
I just have a lot to talk about.
Let's meet and talk tomorrow.

149
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,416
Did you understand or not?
Understood? Bye!

150
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,838
That sounds like excuses.

151
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,981
My mom cooks every meal,
which makes me gain weight.

152
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,025
I should eat low calorie food.

153
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,069
Rice noodles are low in calories.

154
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,279
Sounds like you're showing off.

155
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,074
I admit. I'm showing off a little bit.

156
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,409
You deserve to.

157
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,998
Thank you...

158
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,252
for being so nice to my mom.

159
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:58,838
Also for the presents.

160
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,133
-If my mom did something wrong--
-She didn't. Not at all.

161
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,095
She couldn't possibly.

162
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,138
She is your mother.

163
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,607
I don't know why mom does that!

164
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,943
When I had a boyfriend at 15,

165
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,236
she met him secretly.

166
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,530
It's not nice to suddenly bring up
your ex-boyfriend.

167
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,324
I was just... taking an example.

168
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,410
The example does not have to be your ex.

169
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,872
I met him when I was 15. He is not my ex.

170
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,167
OK, OK.

171
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,670
It was playing with fire... fire!

172
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:44,967
Hot fire!

173
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,262
When I was 15!

174
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,363
-I won!
-Really? Are you sure?

175
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,240
500 million won.

176
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,954
That...

177
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:18,334
"500 million won"
written there doesn't mean you won..

178
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,879
The pictures have to match to win.

179
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,382
Haven't you done this before?

180
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,262
You are so born rich.

181
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,264
Just scratch the rest.

182
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,687
Now, this is not a matter of money.
It's a matter of pride.

183
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,861
That one didn't win.

184
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,448
Nice card!

185
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,160
I'm not getting good cards.

186
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,204
Go!

187
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,795
What are you doing now?

188
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:04,588
I feel coldness.

189
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,466
A knife is on its way to my heart.

190
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,177
But don't worry.

191
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,346
The hand is quicker than the eye.

192
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,393
Is this really that big a deal?
Do you need to do that?

193
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,355
This is not a matter of money.
It's a matter of pride.

194
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,108
Let go.

195
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,194
How many did you post?

196
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,405
About ten.

197
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,241
Why are you so slow in typing?

198
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,410
How many did you post?

199
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,744
About 50.

200
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,832
COMMENT: HAN SE-GYE IS THE BEST.

201
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,919
Post at least 30 more.

202
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,049
Han Se-gye is really cool!

203
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:50,759
Times 30!

204
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:54,221
-Han Se-gye is the best!
-She is so pretty and a goddess of acting.

205
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,181
-Han Se-gye is pretty.
-She is very pretty.

206
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,182
You are awesome.

207
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,101
She is beautiful with fair skin.

208
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,020
Shave in the direction
of the hair growth...

209
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,273
from face... to neck.

210
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,483
Around the lips.

211
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,041
Don't laugh. You'll get hurt.

212
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,376
-Will you be done today?
-Yes.

213
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,335
It'll be done soon.

214
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,344
When done, feel with your fingers
to make sure...

215
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,222
you didn't miss anything.

216
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,058
All good.

217
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,310
Wait.

218
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,273
Done now.

219
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,399
Again!

220
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,068
Again!

221
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,264
What's your plan tomorrow?

222
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:23,143
I'm just a supporting actor.
There is not much to do tomorrow.

223
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,479
There's only one scene.

224
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,524
I was happy until I heard that part.

225
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:33,070
Why? Shall me meet tomorrow?
Do you want to see me tomorrow, too?

226
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:37,533
That's me!

227
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:47,417
You said you exercise here all the time.
You must see me everyday!

228
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,473
They edited it so much.

229
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,560
Even I didn't know it was me at first.

230
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,039
Sorry.

231
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,173
I was too excited.

232
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,051
I got carried away like a fool.

233
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,306
I'm really sorry.

234
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,645
I'm OK.

235
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,024
I'm fine with everything.

236
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,819
-Even if you don't recognize me--
-I'm not fine.

237
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:58,989
I'm not fine.

238
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,325
I...

239
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,411
want to see you.

240
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,207
I just want to recognize you.

241
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,172
This was it.

242
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,926
Sharing my burden...

243
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,888
with someone else.

244
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,936
It's same for me, too.

245
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,729
HAN SE-GYE

246
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,085
What are you doing?
Are you looking for me?

247
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:19,671
Yes.

248
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,092
Go in first.

249
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,018
Why?
Do you want me to do another good deed?

250
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,021
No, I want to do a good deed.

251
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,068
Ta-da!

252
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,820
I don't think you had a cake.

253
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,822
You don't eat much.

254
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,699
But still, it's your birthday.

255
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,839
I will simply put just one candle on.

256
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:19,773
I don't think you'd like a song,
so I'll skip it.Â Blow out the candle.

257
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,989
On my birthday,

258
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,368
I got potted flowers.

259
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,956
The meaning of those flowers was

260
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,333
"Happiness that comes no matter what."

261
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,673
I know I shouldn't do this.

262
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,301
But if there's one thing
that makes me happy,

263
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,764
it would be you.

264
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:55,517
Excuse me?

265
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,146
I... like you.

266
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:06,820
It seems that way.

267
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:15,328
I...

268
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:20,876
I'm kind,
so you might have misunderstood.

269
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,963
But I love the Lord.

270
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,633
I want to follow in his footsteps.

271
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,599
I get it.

272
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,436
It happens a lot.

273
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,939
It has happened
since I was in elementary school.

274
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,650
So don't blame yourself--

275
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,486
You said you don't like a bad person.

276
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:48,820
So,

277
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,742
why are you acting badly toward me?

278
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:05,962
Also, I don't like cake.

279
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,060
I don't have a religion,

280
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,145
but I'm desperate.

281
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,816
Please give him to me.

282
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,612
If you do,
I will give the church a lot of money.

283
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,741
I will give more than you think.

284
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:21,288
I'm trying to negotiate.

285
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,873
So please...

286
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,961
give Ryu Eun-ho to me.

287
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,924
I look forward to your positive reply.

288
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,653
What's wrong with me?

289
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,740
What's wrong with me?

290
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,117
What's wrong with you guys?

291
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,787
Why? What's going on?

292
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,123
Why do I do things
that I'll regret later?

293
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,626
I should've been nicer.

294
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,795
I should've been a bit nicer.

295
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:12,464
I know.

296
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,634
Why do I always regret things later?

297
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,720
I should've been less nice.

298
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,598
I should've been less nice!

299
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,600
What is this?

300
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,144
Are you competing
in a secret word competition?

301
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:28,605
FROM: MOM

302
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:34,903
-Why aren't you picking up?
-Get it right. I can't!

303
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,781
And she will repeat herself
on that same topic.

304
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:41,493
-What topic?
-Getting married and so on.

305
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,953
Already? No!

306
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,833
Are you speaking as a friend
or as a president?

307
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:50,669
Both!

308
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,298
Just do it.

309
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,592
Do it while I'm here.

310
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,845
Once I start school,
I cannot attend your wedding.

311
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:02,597
Are you really going this time?

312
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,266
I submitted the admission form yesterday.

313
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,102
-What?
-What?

314
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,687
Why are you just telling us now?

315
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,688
Please don't move.

316
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,606
She said not to move.

317
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,525
Can I move my foot?

318
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,696
You're making a sitcom out of this.

319
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,864
Look who's talking!
You're making a soap opera!

320
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,450
-I can move my foot, right?
-You are all done.

321
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,954
Why did it have to be finished now?

322
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:29,999
Who's this?

323
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:32,377
Hello?

324
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,754
Are you Han Sook-hee's emergency contact?

325
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:37,799
Excuse me?

326
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,277
Mom!

327
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,070
Hi!

328
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,322
You are here!

329
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,909
Mom... what are you doing here?

330
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,787
Aren't you busy today?

331
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,123
I thought you would be too busy to come.

332
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:12,083
What are you doing here?

333
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,461
Why are you laying down here?

334
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:18,631
It's difficult

335
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,925
to diagnoseÂ pancreatic cancer early.

336
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:26,014
It does not have early indicators.
It's more like ordinary stomachache.

337
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:30,852
In most cases, when symptoms show,
the cancer is already spreading.

338
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:34,856
When your mother came to the ER,

339
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,859
she was already aware of her condition.

340
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,862
How likely is she to live?

341
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,365
In her case...

342
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,619
the survival rate is less than 10%.

343
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:53,958
Then...

344
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,586
how much...

345
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,053
how much time does she have left?

346
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,975
One month... at best.

347
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,279
This can't be true.

348
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,369
This really can't be true.

349
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,515
-Mom.
-Yes?

350
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,851
Why are you making that?

351
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:56,312
It's for Gging-ggang to wear on cold days.

352
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:04,404
Is that what you want to do now?

353
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,198
When else can I do it?

354
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,412
Aren't you even angry?

355
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,831
Don't you think it's unfair?

356
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:25,008
I am angry. It is unfair.

357
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,762
But there is nothing I can do about it.

358
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:35,393
Do you know what I was doing?

359
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:43,192
Before I came here,
I was getting my nails done.

360
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,824
When you were in so much pain
in your room,

361
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:55,246
all I was doing was getting
my stupid nails done.

362
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:58,041
Se-gye.

363
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,919
You called me
while I was getting my nails done.

364
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:04,047
I thought...

365
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,968
you were going to...

366
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,097
just nag some more.

367
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,394
So I didn't pick up.

368
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:24,943
It's OK. You didn't know.

369
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,278
So why didn't you tell me?

370
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,661
Why do you make me a bad daughter?

371
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,038
How much...

372
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:43,086
How much would I have hated myself
if that was my last chance?

373
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,048
How would I...

374
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,428
live like that?

375
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,139
I'm sorry.

376
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:02,230
I didn't want to break your heart.

377
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,654
You only care about me.

378
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:14,033
You and I both only care about me.

379
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:18,454
Why do you only care about me?

380
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,500
Because you are my daughter.

381
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,713
Because you are my one and only daughter.

382
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,053
It's a beautiful day.

383
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,223
Yes.

384
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,935
It is a beautiful day.

385
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,065
Don't be sick.

386
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,569
Because I like you,

387
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,074
not because you are Se-gye's boyfriend,

388
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:38,201
but because I like you,

389
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:42,872
I want you to be healthy and not get sick.

390
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,542
I want you to be happy.

391
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,509
Thank you for the presents.

392
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:56,969
That was nothing.

393
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,807
I just wanted to receive
something like that,

394
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:04,435
and I didn't think there would be
another chance after that day,

395
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,979
so I accepted them.

396
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,940
You did the right thing.

397
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:18,366
Please hold her hand when I leave.

398
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:24,122
I passed my baton to you, OK?

399
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,624
Yes.

400
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,298
Is her movie almost finished?

401
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,927
Will you go and watch the movie with me?

402
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:41,514
Are you going to buy me popcorn?

403
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,351
I'll buy tickets and drinks, too.

404
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:50,148
I will definitely go,
since my son-in-law is buying everything,

405
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,829
Even though we both knew
it was a promise we couldn't keep,

406
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,748
we still made the promise.

407
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:13,421
To be more sad? Or to be less sad?

408
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:18,593
I don't know, but...

409
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:23,639
maybe because we desperately wanted
to keep the promise.

410
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,767
Look here, Mom.

411
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,061
Although death seems far away,

412
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,272
it's always near us.

413
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:35,318
-It's a video...
-You should've said so!

414
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:38,446
-I didn't even put lipstick on.
-You are pretty even without it.

415
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:42,783
-I'm even prettier with lipstick.
-OK, OK.

416
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,536
-Zoom in!
-No, no!

417
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:51,626
By the time we realize its existence,
death is right next to us,

418
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,128
so we cannot run away.

419
00:36:56,797 --> 00:37:00,301
This is so cute, so dainty.

420
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,261
It's beyond cute.

421
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,430
Right?

422
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,016
I only make pretty things.

423
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,228
Of course, Ms.Â Han Sook-hee!

424
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,939
This is my present for Gging-ggang,

425
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:18,319
hoping she will live right next you
for a long time.

426
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,241
That is why I need to say it.

427
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,415
I love you, Mom.

428
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,264
-I love you, Mom.
-I love you.

429
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:50,434
I love you! I love you.

430
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,811
I love you, too.

431
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,491
I love you, Mom.

432
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,591
I love you, Mom.

433
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:33,227
Time always flies faster than we think.

434
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:38,733
-I will need go abroad for a while. Sorry.
-Have a safe trip.

435
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:55,976
Is it already that time?

436
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,068
Why?

437
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,907
Why now?

438
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,619
Why does it have to be now?

439
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:38,477
Se-gye, don't worry.

440
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,898
Don't mention it. OK?

441
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,030
Mom!

442
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,453
Where is Se-gye?

443
00:40:56,745 --> 00:41:03,085
She had to go the film shooting
she could not get out of it.

444
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:08,215
She is a movie star. That's the way it is.

445
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:12,553
She will be back soon.

446
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,017
Time passes.

447
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:08,442
Night comes, followed by morning,
and then day.

448
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,862
And then evening and night again.

449
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:28,087
Days are just passing by without meaning.

450
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:36,637
When you get sick or hurt,

451
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,724
I feel like you're being punished
for my wrongs.

452
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:51,819
If there is a god, please make it end
as soon as possible.

453
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,613
Just one day earlier, please.

454
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,081
UNCLE

455
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:16,635
-Hello?
-Your voice has changed.

456
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,806
Because I changed,
even at a time like this.

457
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:25,019
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you.

458
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,773
You are with me, now.

459
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:31,942
Han Se-gye.

460
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:38,198
Will you please call me "Se-gye"?

461
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,328
I so need to hear that right now.

462
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,414
Se-gye!

463
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,919
Can you say that one more time?

464
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:53,756
Se-gye!

465
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,017
Now, I feel like myself.

466
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,148
YOU U-MI

467
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:17,321
I'm getting another call.
I'll call you back.

468
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,053
Who are you?

469
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:56,920
My daughter?

470
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:02,176
Mom! Mom...

471
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:10,559
You... are my daughter.

472
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:15,272
I thought you were too busy.

473
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:23,447
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

474
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:29,036
I'm... I'm so sorry.

475
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,666
You are having such a hard time.

476
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,545
I had no idea.

477
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:46,261
My heart... aches so much.

478
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,682
It isn't your fault.

479
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,895
You didn't do anything wrong.

480
00:46:56,772 --> 00:47:00,442
I didn't think
I would get to see your older face.

481
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,951
It's good to see you like this.

482
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:15,666
It feels like you are my friend.

483
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,254
Mom...

484
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:27,427
Next time, I will quickly...

485
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:34,768
quickly recognize your pain.

486
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:42,109
So in the next life...

487
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:50,033
let's live together.

488
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,119
Yes, yes.

489
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:56,999
In the next life,

490
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,003
will you be my daughter?

491
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:05,549
Then, I will...

492
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:11,763
do better.

493
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:19,813
No Mom, don't go.

494
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:23,734
You have to see my face before you go.

495
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:27,738
You have to see my face before you go!

496
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:34,328
Even when I close my eyes,

497
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:40,792
I can see your face.

498
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:59,353
Mom? Mom?

499
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:04,566
Mom, open your eyes.

500
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,362
Mom! Mom!

501
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,156
Open your eyes!

502
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:15,118
Mom! Mom!

503
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,703
Mom!

504
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:20,374
Mom!

505
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,459
-Just a minute!
-Mom!

506
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:29,257
Mom!

507
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,642
I will pronounce the time of death.

508
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:43,188
October 30, 2018 atÂ 11:20 a.m.

509
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,774
Ms. Han Sook-hee died.

510
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:51,071
Mom!

511
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:55,701
-Mom!
-Get up!

512
00:49:56,576 --> 00:50:00,580
-Mom!
-Let's go.

513
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:10,799
Hold on. Just wait a bit.

514
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:13,969
I will take care of this.

515
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:16,763
Just wait.

516
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:03,643
I'm sorry for being late.

517
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:11,860
I'm sorry.

518
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:28,335
Thank you for the delicious food.

519
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:30,712
I will...

520
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,549
love your precious daughter

521
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:37,803
even more.

522
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:41,556
Rest in peace.

523
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:14,506
What's this? What is all this?

524
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,226
Where is my senior?

525
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:11,980
She just went out to compose herself.

526
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,018
I wish...

527
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:20,483
I had changed a little sooner.

528
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:27,115
So that my mom could see me
before she left.

529
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,386
Oh, my lipstick.

530
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:12,577
Huh?

531
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:16,247
There was no one there.

532
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:19,250
I didn't see her go in.

533
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:43,650
-Are they back together?
-If he is here, they must be.

534
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:50,698
You don't have to do this for me.

535
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:53,535
It will cause you trouble.

536
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:13,221
You are the one who is saddest
and having the most trouble, silly.

537
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:16,516
Who are you caring about now?

538
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:03,771
What will you do now, without your mom?

539
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,066
-You--
-After the accident,

540
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:12,280
noble words
at the funeral didn't do any good.

541
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:17,660
At least not for me.

542
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:24,459
Instead of words like "It's OK"
or "Cheer up",

543
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:28,796
those who asked "what will you do now?"

544
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:34,552
were the ones
that touched my heart the most.

545
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:38,556
That's why I'm asking.

546
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:43,353
I thought you didn't like me.

547
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,192
Because my brother likes you...

548
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,198
I came here.

549
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:03,206
He is my brother after all.

550
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:07,752
Thank you for coming.

551
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:13,800
I will remember
that you shared my sadness.

552
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:20,098
Don't remember such a useless thing.

553
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:28,398
I really didn't want to say this.

554
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:31,568
But I will.

555
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:43,830
Cheer up. I mean it.

556
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,863
She will pretend she's OK.

557
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:22,327
She might talk about her grief on her own.

558
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:26,080
She might even joke around
about her grief.

559
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,042
But...

560
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:33,755
that won't be real.

561
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:41,054
I was like that when...

562
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,556
when I lost my mom.

563
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:52,231
Take good care of your friend,
with love...

564
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:59,072
as you will be a man of God.

565
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:09,332
I will go now.
I did not come here for a bad purpose.

566
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:13,002
I came here to give sincere consolation.

567
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:15,505
Take care.

568
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,591
The coffee was good.

569
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:54,085
Se-gye, go and sleep.

570
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:57,213
How can I sleep?

571
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,008
I'm not sleepy.

572
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:04,637
Then, cry.

573
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:08,307
The chief mourner shouldn't cry.

574
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:13,938
If I cry, everyone will.

575
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:18,109
Go cry. I will be the chief mourner.

576
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:23,573
I won't cry,

577
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:26,993
so you can cry, silly.

578
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:34,542
I won't cry, so you both can cry.

579
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:33,768
Do you want to go outside for a while?

580
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:48,241
Maybe... my mom knew.

581
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:53,496
Even with that face,

582
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,751
She recognized me right away.

583
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:04,298
She probably didn't know it.

584
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:08,886
She didn't know,

585
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:11,597
but at that moment,

586
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:15,351
she must have realized it.

587
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:21,774
I was like that.

588
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,820
When you were crying there,

589
01:04:28,155 --> 01:04:30,074
I just knew it was you.

590
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:38,833
I felt, "Oh...
you are standing there and crying..."

591
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:44,380
Your mom must have felt the same.

592
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:50,970
"Oh, Se-gye is crying.

593
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:56,601
My daughter is crying."

594
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:04,984
My mom had good intuition.

595
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:11,032
I thought,
"What will I do without my mom?

596
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:17,330
I will be all alone."

597
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,167
But I was not alone.

598
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:26,797
I have U-mi,

599
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:30,927
Eun-ho,

600
01:05:32,553 --> 01:05:33,971
and you.

601
01:05:36,223 --> 01:05:38,851
And your people came to me.

602
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:42,521
Other people...

603
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:49,695
and more people came to me.

604
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:55,743
I'm not alone.

605
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:00,081
I know it.

606
01:06:02,249 --> 01:06:03,751
I know it well.

607
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:07,922
But...

608
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:12,843
nevertheless...

609
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:18,975
I miss my mom.

610
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:28,901
Why me? Why does it have to me?

611
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:34,532
What did I do wrong?

612
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,453
What did I do so wrong...

613
01:06:42,206 --> 01:06:43,499
that I could never...

614
01:06:46,794 --> 01:06:49,213
even show my face to my mom?

615
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:55,177
Han Se-gye.

616
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:57,013
What if someday,

617
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:02,143
I never come back to my real face?

618
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:08,357
What if I get in an accident
with a different face?

619
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:16,490
What if I die with a different face?

620
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:22,288
What if no one recognizes me?

621
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:29,086
I'm so scared of that.

622
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:35,968
I probably sound silly.

623
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,182
My mom is dead.

624
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:46,645
And this is the first thought
that comes to my mind.

625
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:53,944
If that happens,

626
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:57,823
I will find you.

627
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:01,452
I will find you.

628
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:11,003
And right away,

629
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:15,091
I will hold your hand like this.

630
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:27,663
