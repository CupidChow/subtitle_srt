1
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,544
Han Se-gye!

2
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,899
AUNTIE

3
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,072
Are you really...

4
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,327
I'm sorry.

5
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,003
My face...

6
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,946
My face is not coming back.

7
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,328
"EPISODE 13"

8
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,249
How can you be so OK?

9
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,334
Did you think I would die?

10
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,630
I controlled the car

11
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,258
just right, so...

12
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,885
So you laid down in a coma?

13
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,264
Wouldn't it be weird to lay down
if you're awake?

14
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,893
I went to the gates of heaven.

15
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,104
When I tried to enter,

16
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,022
they said to bring you, too,
so I came back.

17
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,357
Why are you killing me now?

18
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,818
It wouldn't work.

19
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:42,198
You don't want to sacrifice.
You can't be a priest. Give up.

20
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,953
Actually, I've been thinking
about that, too.

21
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,956
-Really?
-I'm not sure.

22
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,874
Let me know when you are sure.

23
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:55,878
Lift the bowl.

24
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,222
Thank you for the food. I'll go.

25
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,140
Go where?

26
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,226
To find Se-gye.

27
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,230
She must've gotten
pointlessly lost somewhere.

28
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,775
Mom, I'm going now.

29
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,360
Thank you for the food.

30
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:23,031
Did you just drink your meal
without chewing it?

31
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,618
I'll make a bone soup,
so bring Se-gye too.

32
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,121
Why... why bone soup again?

33
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,751
Bone soup is the best for strengthening
bones and giving stamina.

34
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,045
That's what you are serving all month!

35
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,629
How old are you?

36
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,298
You still complain about food.

37
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,801
Then, I will come back with Se-gye.

38
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,345
-Come together.
-OK.

39
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,721
You!

40
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,431
Your son is the best!

41
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,433
-Bye.
-Bye!

42
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,435
Call me.

43
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,563
Can you reach Se-gye?

44
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,774
Do you feel OK?

45
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,110
I came here by myself. I'm fine.

46
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,279
Can you reach her?

47
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,490
You can, right?

48
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,786
If Se-gye wanted to hide
because she is sorry--

49
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,079
She came over.

50
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,915
But she disappeared.

51
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,417
When? Where?

52
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,127
You should've held her.

53
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,755
What was her face like

54
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,716
when you saw her last time?

55
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:26,469
An old man.

56
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:28,971
She was an old man.

57
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,848
Even after a week...

58
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,311
Han se-gye looked the same.

59
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,608
She said her face was not coming back.

60
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,071
So?

61
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,325
For a long time, I've been thinking

62
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,412
something like this might happen.

63
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,040
So what are you going to do?

64
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,584
If Se-gye is like that forever,

65
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,214
if she has to live as an old man forever,

66
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,217
can you still love her?

67
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,351
I'm not sure.

68
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:20,440
Will I be able to love her forever?

69
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,569
Can I not care what other people think?

70
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,738
Can I not judge myself?

71
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,659
Can I spend a whole life with her?

72
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,000
Please help me.

73
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,382
You're the best!

74
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,942
I tried really hard to conclude on my own,

75
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,360
but I couldn't.

76
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:20,875
All these people...

77
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,755
Why are they all marked as Han Se-gye?

78
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:31,052
NEITHER SHE NOR HER SITUATION MAKES SENSE.

79
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,724
You just lost your chance.

80
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,942
The chance to be honest with someone.

81
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,235
I know well

82
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,488
that those chances don't come often.

83
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,659
It means they are all Han Se-gye.

84
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,298
He's really crazy in love.

85
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,847
HAN SE-GYE

86
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,641
HAN SE-GYE

87
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:22,436
HAN SE-GYE

88
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,315
She is his whole life.

89
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,237
I didn't need to worry.

90
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,906
Why was I worried?

91
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:44,041
I thought a day like this might come
one day.

92
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:56,512
Although I didn't know
I would look like this.

93
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,399
I miss him.

94
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,237
Even when I look like this,
I still miss him.

95
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,116
I'm dying to see him.

96
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,467
I'm getting off.

97
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,891
After becoming like this,

98
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,562
I thought I had to send you away.

99
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,399
I kept thinking that.

100
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,235
But I couldn't.

101
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:36,987
So,

102
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,907
I wanted to talk.

103
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,827
I wanted to beg.

104
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,540
I won't ask for anything.

105
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:52,086
I will just come to see you sometimes.

106
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:57,633
If you live like that, what will I do?

107
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,264
Do you know how much I suffered?

108
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,476
Because I was afraid
of how people would think of me,

109
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,730
I almost lost you.

110
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,023
After realizing that,

111
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,277
I began to hate myself again.

112
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,779
While I dated you,

113
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,782
while I loved you,

114
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,077
and while I was loved by you,
I forgot things.

115
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,164
But they came back.

116
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:33,419
I almost lived that awful life again.

117
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,546
Seo Do-jae!

118
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,718
I'm ready to give up everything.

119
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,512
I can leave my family and work.

120
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:48,309
I'm ready to go to you.

121
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,604
That's how I'll live.

122
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,608
I am fine,

123
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,236
no matter how you look.

124
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,899
How is it possible?

125
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,569
How can you live like that?

126
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,423
I'm me, right?

127
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,177
I came back!

128
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,542
You crazy...

129
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:41,130
That's what I want to say.
Were you crazy?

130
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,631
You said I should trust you.

131
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,258
And that's what you did?

132
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,052
-How could you crash your car?
-What?

133
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,556
I wanted to hit Chae Yu-ri, but I didn't.
Why?

134
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,600
You are really crazy!

135
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,899
Why didn't your face come back?

136
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,400
I don't know.

137
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,360
It just didn't come back.

138
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,237
How did you come back?

139
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,156
I don't know that either.

140
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,199
Suddenly...

141
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,119
Has it ever made sense?

142
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,706
Your disease needs to be consistent!

143
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,750
Whatever.

144
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,837
When you didn't come back, I was afraid
my business would go bankrupt.

145
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,673
Am I just money to you?

146
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:27,927
Of course.

147
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,098
When you go next time,
leave Gging-ggang here.

148
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,186
She suffered so much that
she got skinny!

149
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,772
What do you mean skinny?
I fed her really well.

150
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,607
You just fed yourself.

151
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,734
I even got snacks for her!

152
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:44,944
Only your face got chubby.

153
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,238
I heard Han Se-gye got plastic surgery.

154
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,617
Something went wrong,
and that's why she's not on TV.

155
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,701
Isn't she pregnant?

156
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,454
Someone I know saw her in the hospital.

157
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,664
No way.

158
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,416
Her agent president was in the hospital.
Maybe she was mistaken.

159
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:00,918
Watch what you say.

160
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,088
If you say the wrong thing these days,
you get sued.

161
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,174
See? It's a strange situation to anyone.

162
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,970
I just need to give a little hint.

163
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,395
Hi, Reporter Park.

164
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,399
I have an interesting story
about Han Se-gye.

165
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:39,581
She asks for a week off every month
in any contract.

166
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,334
Or she runs away.

167
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,877
Why does she need to run away?

168
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,340
Off days are too regular to think
she just doesn't want to work.

169
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,718
Look at this!

170
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,761
Isn't this strange?

171
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,972
She didn't go in, but she came out.

172
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,102
Where did you get this?

173
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,314
I don't know.
Maybe my coordinator gave it to me?

174
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,191
Or my manager?

175
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,735
Anyway, someone gave it to me.

176
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,613
What do you think it is?
I don't know.

177
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,824
She's doing this again!

178
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,784
Oh, hi Se-gye.

179
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,912
-Han Se-gye.
-There she is.

180
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,167
What's this?
Did you call her to come here?

181
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,837
Maybe she's under a lot of stress.

182
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:30,049
She keeps saying I change my face.

183
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,053
She watched too many cartoons.

184
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,641
That's not it.

185
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,644
I have a proof right here.

186
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,938
-If you look at this...
-Then what?

187
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,901
What's there? I only see myself.

188
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,654
You went out of the bathroom, but...

189
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:57,534
You need to see a doctor.
An inferiority complex is a disease, too.

190
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,453
Whose loss do you think that'll be?

191
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,582
Don't be dumb.
Try to see the real situation.

192
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,127
Even if you get away like this,

193
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,087
as long as I know--

194
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,797
I think you forgot.

195
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:23,227
What? Did you think I'd be gracious?

196
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,145
You're the one who said

197
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,273
I don't show up at work,
I run away from the shooting scene,

198
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,733
and I meet any man.

199
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,902
That's all about me, not you.

200
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:35,781
So this is me!

201
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,909
-Hey!
-What?

202
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,746
Do you want to pour one, too?

203
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,916
In the middle of this crowd?

204
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,627
Will you be able to do it?

205
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,926
I'm used to it.

206
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:59,429
Pouring a drink won't change
how people see me.

207
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,016
People will talk about me
for a couple of weeks, at most.

208
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:06,395
My reputation is bad already.
I don't care.

209
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,273
One more thing.

210
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,821
I'm warning you.

211
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,283
Stop talking crazy.

212
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,619
Do I change my face?

213
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:25,956
I wish I could.

214
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,213
So that I can kill you
with a different face.

215
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,052
Then no one will know.

216
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,389
You'll die. I'll vanish.

217
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,102
That would be the perfect crime.

218
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,571
Why? Are you a bit scared now?

219
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,284
I'll go now.

220
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,589
"Is actress C delusional?

221
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:20,135
It's well know that actress C
and actress H don't get along.

222
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:24,056
Rumor has it
that actress H is harassing actress C,

223
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,934
but in fact actress C has a serious
inferiority complex over actress H.

224
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,228
Maybe that was the cause?

225
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,105
The rumor is that actress C is suffering
from delusion.

226
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,525
Actress C keeps claiming
actress H's face is changing

227
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,904
with no known cause, bewildering everyone.

228
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:43,992
Actress H's camp says she genuinely wishes
actress C a fast recovery.

229
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,703
Actress H seems very kind.

230
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,540
C is Chae Yu-ri. H is Han Se-gye."

231
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,960
I did a wonderful job!

232
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,590
I did it so well.

233
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,926
She is delusional.

234
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,681
Serves her right!

235
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:12,229
Gosh, I wish I could've seen her face!

236
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,774
That was my best acting ever.

237
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,609
I showed everything I got.

238
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,821
-Grand Award goes to you!
-The honor goes to my agent.

239
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,410
I'm glad I'm on your side.

240
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,246
Let's be friends forever.

241
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:30,539
Let's not become enemies.

242
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:34,668
Right? I'm glad she is on my side.

243
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,842
You are here!

244
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,351
Hey Gging-ggang, be quiet.

245
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:57,107
That's strange.
She's usually very friendly.

246
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,358
I know.

247
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,195
She does this sometimes.

248
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,490
It's OK. Don't feel bad.

249
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,451
You're OK.

250
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,494
Calm down.

251
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,959
-Who's this? I'm not expecting anyone.
-Who's there?

252
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,546
It's OK.

253
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,008
It's fine.

254
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:29,723
You?

255
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:32,809
Now that you have a girlfriend
and friends, don't you need me anymore?

256
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,102
How did you come here?

257
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,188
Why do you ask? Isn't it obvious?

258
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,939
-I followed you.
-Gosh.

259
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,526
Everyone looks familiar!

260
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,363
-May I sit?
-You already did.

261
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,822
This looks good.

262
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,575
I didn't eat dinner yet.

263
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,452
Wait, pay first.

264
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,079
Everyone paid 10,000 won equally.

265
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:53,872
Take it from him.

266
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,792
Jeong Ju-hwan!

267
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,340
You already revealed your disease, right?

268
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,390
He did! He absolutely did.

269
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,601
I'm the only one
who didn't know he told you.

270
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:17,354
That's... The thing is...

271
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:22,317
Things were complicated,
so Seo Do-jae couldn't tell you.

272
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:26,113
He makes his girlfriend speak for him.

273
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,532
I can't believe my boss is such a fool.

274
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,870
I will raise your salary.

275
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,831
I will serve you as hard as I can.

276
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:40,669
I'm envious.

277
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,007
Oh, hey!

278
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,801
Who are you?

279
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,679
Wow, seriously?

280
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:52,806
Why?

281
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,273
Wh... why?

282
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,238
Hi doggy!

283
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,909
It's OK, doggy.

284
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,124
Stop it and go.

285
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,544
Just sit.

286
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,839
That's strange.

287
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,090
It's OK, doggy.

288
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,220
She is such a good doggy.

289
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,493
It was fun today. Wasn't it?

290
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,412
Secretary Jeong is such a nice man.

291
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,874
That is why he's been next to me
for such a long time.

292
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,169
Those who stay next to us are

293
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:07,005
all nice people.

294
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,090
It's because you are nice.

295
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,594
It's because you are nice.

296
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,435
This time...

297
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:24,814
I was afraid.

298
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,991
The saddest thing
about getting the disease was

299
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,578
that I could not recognize people I love.

300
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,457
As I couldn't tell the people who I love,

301
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,127
I couldn't love myself either.

302
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,299
But I was wrong.

303
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,469
Nothing has changed.

304
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:59,266
I thought if people change,
the situation changes, too.

305
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,434
But that was my misunderstanding.

306
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:03,937
I learned that

307
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,065
from you.

308
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,867
The first time it happened to me,

309
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:22,038
I got help from someone.

310
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:28,461
A complete stranger risked
his life for me.

311
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,049
So I wanted to help others, too.

312
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,013
Whenever I changed,

313
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,933
I used to just wish time would fly,

314
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,103
but I came out to the world

315
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:49,149
all because of you.

316
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,653
I'm better.

317
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,365
I became a better person.

318
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,841
I will reveal my disease.

319
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:22,098
I decided to trust the people I love.

320
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:35,445
I know you've had hard times until now.

321
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,498
I have a disease.

322
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,839
When I got into that car accident
ten years ago,

323
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,675
I got a brain injury.

324
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:58,426
So,

325
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,054
I cannot recognize faces anymore.

326
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:03,765
What?

327
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,559
What are you talking about?

328
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,020
Dad, it was--

329
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,107
What do you mean
you can't recognize faces?

330
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,859
You heard me.

331
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,112
I have prosopagnosia.

332
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,323
I don't remember your face, Grandpa.

333
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,910
If you pretended to be someone else
and walked past me,

334
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:27,288
I wouldn't recognize your face.

335
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,584
Is it serious?

336
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,711
Yes, it is.

337
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,257
-Can't they fix it?
-They can't.

338
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,264
Did you know about this?

339
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,769
I did.

340
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:53,815
What about you?

341
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:57,610
Well... I didn't know.

342
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,990
You are my daughter,

343
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,326
but you are strong, too strong.

344
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,369
You knew all about this,

345
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:10,415
and didn't say anything
to me or your husband?

346
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,588
Don't blame Mother.

347
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,048
That was what I wanted to do, too.

348
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:22,302
Grandpa, you were about to kick him out

349
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,512
if he had the smallest flaw.

350
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,433
How could he tell you about it?

351
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,984
Grandpa, are you crying?

352
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,363
How can I not cry?

353
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:43,656
Why are you crying?

354
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,368
Because I regret

355
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,746
everything I said to you.

356
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,748
Because I'm sorry.

357
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,352
It must've been so hard for you!

358
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:17,982
You must have hated me
for not knowing anything.

359
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:19,776
I'm sorry

360
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,070
that I didn't meet your expectations.

361
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,071
Nonsense!

362
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:27,075
I can't find a better person than you
in this country.

363
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,955
Since everyone is in the right mood,
I have something to say, too.

364
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,044
I...

365
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:40,630
am not marrying President Choi.

366
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:42,966
Why not?

367
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,301
What is it? Isn't he nice to you?

368
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,637
I don't love him.

369
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,390
I loved what he had.

370
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,436
Don't do it.

371
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,231
No one in this family asked you

372
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,692
to marry him.

373
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,819
In reality, I was the reason.

374
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:08,241
You must've needed his help to beat me.

375
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,577
True. But...

376
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,121
it is not your fault.

377
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,624
Even though I just turned to your side,

378
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,336
that was because of my greed.

379
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:25,049
Everything is... my fault.

380
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,968
It's all my fault.

381
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:28,803
It is my fault.

382
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:31,723
I made them fight...

383
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,182
Blame yourself later.

384
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,976
We have a more urgent matter.

385
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,521
President Choi knows Do-jae is sick.

386
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,399
Pretty soon, CEO Kim will find out, too.

387
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:42,692
After that,

388
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,778
they will try to take him down.

389
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:51,659
Choi Gi-ho, arrogant scumbag.

390
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:56,164
CEO Kim, arrogant scumbag!

391
00:31:56,623 --> 00:32:01,753
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't be upset.

392
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:04,339
Calm down, everyone. Calm down.

393
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:07,216
You beat me to it.

394
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,803
If you are sorry,

395
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,056
please take care of them, Grandpa.

396
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,688
You're incapable!

397
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:25,610
You can't even take care of that,
but you want my company?

398
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:30,073
I can't leave my company
to such an incompetent idiot.

399
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,575
There you go. That's more like you.

400
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,913
I was hoping the good mood
would make Grandpa let it slide.

401
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,165
Just because the Director is sick,

402
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,876
Sunho Group will not go down.

403
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:45,546
Don't worry. I can work more.

404
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,382
And we have Sa-ra.

405
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,009
That's what I am worried about.

406
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,177
If you're worried,

407
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,513
I can go and do business.

408
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,848
Do you think doing business is easy?

409
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,351
Just grow your flowers.

410
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,076
President Choi will make a big fuss.

411
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,246
I know. He can't sit still.

412
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,790
So you take care of that.

413
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,257
You are my brother, so take care of it!

414
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,467
I have to go somewhere.

415
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:42,228
Yes, I just came out of the supermarket.

416
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,148
Yes. OK.

417
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:50,236
Why are you reporting where you are?
Who were you talking to?

418
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,654
You don't need to know.

419
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,532
Hey, do you have a girlfriend?

420
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,700
Stop it.

421
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,577
-You have one.
-I said, stop.

422
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,745
You have one.

423
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:02,165
How old is she? Is she pretty?
Does she do SNS?

424
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,584
Will you stop?

425
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:11,049
Wow, that's a super luxurious car!

426
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,341
Look!

427
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,478
How did you get here?

428
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,233
Who is this?

429
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,945
I'm his sister, Ryu Eun-ho's sister.

430
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,824
Ah, the one you don't get along with.

431
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,206
So, it wasn't true
that you two don't get along well.

432
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,211
I will take him for a moment.

433
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,337
Is that OK?

434
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,423
Of course, it's OK.

435
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,801
Take him all you want.

436
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:58,805
Go, quickly.

437
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,766
Before that pretty lady changes her mind.

438
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,353
Thank you...

439
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:10,274
-Your name is...
-My name is Ryu A-rham.

440
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,151
Thank you A-rham.

441
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,159
Don't say anything when you get home.

442
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,702
Got it?

443
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,830
Mind your own business!

444
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,833
Go now. Hurry!

445
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:31,754
Eun-ho, good luck!

446
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,631
I'm proud of you. Good luck!

447
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,975
If you lose her, I'll kill you.

448
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:51,065
You paid last time,
so it's my turn this time.

449
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:52,692
No.

450
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:54,944
Why not?

451
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,071
I want to buy it for you.

452
00:35:57,363 --> 00:36:00,992
How do you know stuff like that
when you haven't dated anyone?

453
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,285
Eun-ho?

454
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,834
Brother.

455
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,642
Since when do you meet with her?

456
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:28,561
Since 6 O'clock.

457
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,397
That's not what I'm asking.

458
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,150
You're not in a position to get mad.

459
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:37,987
I'm begging him to date me.

460
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,657
Why do you make a woman beg you?
Is that how I taught you?

461
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,117
Why do you beg?

462
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:45,912
I'm the one who said no
to just being friends.

463
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,958
I taught him well.

464
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:52,877
So...

465
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:58,007
You two are really dating?

466
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,219
-Since when?
-Since 6 O'clock.

467
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,597
Han Se-gye, why do you like Seo Do-jae?

468
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:06,974
I just don't understand.

469
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:12,521
He knows how good I am
better than anyone else.

470
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,193
What are you talking about?
Is she good?

471
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,696
He must be hallucinating.

472
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,992
Then, why do you like my sister?

473
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:27,787
She is bad,

474
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:30,790
and that is her charm.

475
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,500
What are you talking about?

476
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,669
She might say bad things,
but she's a very good person.

477
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,587
What are you talking about?
I am bad.

478
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,798
Everyone is so cute.

479
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,593
You two really have a problem.

480
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,597
I agree. They sure have a problem.

481
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,248
Oh, right!

482
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,754
You got the order wrong.

483
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,724
How did your family react?

484
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,518
I didn't get to ask
as we ran into them all of a sudden.

485
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,646
As you've seen, it went well.

486
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,482
My grandpa cried.

487
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:43,195
He was the last person
I'd expect to cry.

488
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,657
Aww. You accomplished something big today.

489
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:49,827
As he cried for me,

490
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:52,830
I whined about a company matter,
hoping he'd handle it.

491
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,540
Then, he yelled at me right away.

492
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:56,625
You deserve it.

493
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,462
You're trying to get it the easy way.

494
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:01,547
You got me.

495
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,092
Do you...

496
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:08,179
want to come in for ramen?

497
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,974
You're trying to get it the easy way.

498
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,310
Do I look that easy to you?

499
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:16,562
I am? Really?

500
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,086
What are you looking at?

501
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:48,386
Why are you leaning against me
if you're awake.

502
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,180
If you know I am awake,

503
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,517
why are you staying still?

504
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,145
Why aren't you asking

505
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,900
if I decided to become a priest

506
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,111
or not?

507
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,863
If you say you'd become a priest now,

508
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:09,615
then...

509
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,411
you'd be a very bad person.

510
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,455
That's a big problem.

511
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:18,749
I'm a good person.

512
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,763
Maybe because I'm a nice person,

513
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,391
but thinking about you

514
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,185
going back to that bad man...

515
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,857
drove me crazy.

516
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,156
I think...

517
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:53,909
I'm too good.

518
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,458
That's not it.

519
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,585
You are really bad.

520
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,092
You are absolutely...

521
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:13,971
bad.

522
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:29,361
Face... recognition... disorder?

523
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,907
That's how I say it
for easy understanding.

524
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:37,161
The exact name is prosopagnosia.

525
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:42,333
So, you cannot tell...

526
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,792
I got in an accident.

527
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:47,796
My brain got injured,
and I got that disorder.

528
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:52,134
It's not like I get confused.

529
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:56,430
I cannot tell people apart at all.

530
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:03,646
That's why I inconvenienced you all
in many ways.

531
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:07,566
I might give you more inconvenience
in the future.

532
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,985
So I'm asking in advance
for your understanding.

533
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:13,781
I feel that

534
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:18,118
I need to explain this in person.

535
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,205
REST IN THE SKY

536
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,501
That's why he knew all the details.

537
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:29,171
Your hair and his pierced ears.

538
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,258
Oblivious to what was going on with him,

539
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,301
we were just making bets on him.

540
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:37,263
I feel sorry for him.
How difficult that must be!

541
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:41,559
Boss, is it OK for people to find out
about the Director's disease?

542
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,143
What do you think?

543
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:47,147
He probably wants something
that's worth the risk.

544
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,149
What couldn't to be OK, though?

545
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,485
It better be OK!

546
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:54,530
I'm really, really not going to
let it happen, OK?

547
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:58,117
I'm gonna show what the Strategic
Planning Department is all about!

548
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:02,121
Are... are you crying now?

549
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,872
-No
-Yes, you are.

550
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,124
I said no.

551
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:06,083
Boss, here...

552
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,502
I'm not crying...

553
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:10,796
It's OK.

554
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,595
Wait for me!

555
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,974
You've gone through difficult times.

556
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:23,809
It wasn't that bad.

557
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,979
Right.
I am the one who had difficult times.

558
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:31,025
Well, that's true.

559
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:32,401
You did well.

560
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:36,196
Could you not use the past tense?

561
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:37,698
More difficulties are awaiting.

562
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,951
Sorry for making more work for you.

563
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:45,205
It's fine.
It's an investment for the future.

564
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,916
I have to make you the President
so that I can be a CEO.

565
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:53,130
I'll take good care of it,
so that it doesn't become an issue.

566
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,424
I'm a genius. I can do this.

567
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,635
Do you still have the dream?

568
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,928
It is not a dream. It's a realistic goal.

569
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,683
By now, this issue will start
to leak outside.

570
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,478
-What's next?
-Next is...

571
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:11,273
to wait.

572
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,821
What? Prosopagnosia?

573
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:18,947
Yes.

574
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,784
I heard he told
his employees about it today. In person!

575
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,954
Is that a serious disease?

576
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,875
I don't recognize
people that well, either.

577
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:33,337
So, what's it like?

578
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,714
He can't see or what?

579
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,174
Can you explain it simply?

580
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:40,761
Even if he sees a face,
he cannot tell who the person is.

581
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:41,887
What?

582
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,642
OK. Symptoms are not important.

583
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,603
The fact that he has
the disease is important.

584
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,648
How can we let an ill person take charge
of the company, right?

585
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:55,109
That's not right.
It'll cause a big issue.

586
00:44:56,777 --> 00:45:00,406
This was what Cho Gi-ho was talking about.

587
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:02,199
DASHI TOUR PRESIDENT CHOI GI-HO

588
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,038
T-ROAD CEO KIM

589
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,712
President Choi, did you hear the news?

590
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:15,713
Hear what?

591
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:16,714
Just that...

592
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:20,384
our Director Seo has a sad story.

593
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:23,887
I felt so bad for him.

594
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:27,141
-He has... what's it called?
-Prosopagnosia.

595
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,976
Prosopagnosia?

596
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:29,977
Is that right?

597
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:35,023
He revealed the hidden card you prepared.

598
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:38,777
He is not an average man.

599
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,529
Did he reveal that himself?

600
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:42,239
He did!

601
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:46,118
Oh my. You must be disappointed.

602
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:52,040
It would've worked better if you had
shared it with me in the first place.

603
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:55,043
Business is all about cooperation.

604
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,424
Turn the car around.

605
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,593
Turn it around!

606
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:08,557
-You can't go in.
-Don't you dare!

607
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:18,066
It's OK. You can leave.

608
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,450
Can't you knock?

609
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,494
You just revealed the card like that?

610
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,120
Are you insane?

611
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:34,833
You said it was a present.

612
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,338
I get to decide where to unwrap it.

613
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:42,925
Or was it a bomb?

614
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:46,512
Then, I threw it at you.

615
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,597
-Kang Sa-ra!
-I...

616
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:51,850
won't marry you.

617
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:56,063
You are out of your mind.

618
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:58,899
I helped you out of sympathy
and now, you do this to me?

619
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,069
-You don't know what's scary.
-I do know.

620
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,489
I was almost on your side.

621
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:09,993
That's what's really scary.

622
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,621
Stop playing around.

623
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,123
I went easy on you as you are a woman,
and...

624
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,752
-Who are you?
-Delivery service.

625
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,298
Who's this scum? What are you two?

626
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,759
I called him.
I have a delivery to send out.

627
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:30,222
I was suspicious,
and it seems I was right.

628
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:32,933
Are you making all this fuss
because of a guy?

629
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,810
Kang Sa-ra, really?

630
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:37,521
Do you really think I did this
because of a guy?

631
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,691
This involves a lot of guys.

632
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:53,745
Are you alright?

633
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,165
No, I'm not.

634
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:04,464
I wanted to show you what I've given up.

635
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,676
That's why I asked you to come.

636
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:10,345
I want to...

637
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:15,809
give up something, too.

638
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,145
Then do it.

639
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,660
Dashi Tour President Choi,
what brings you here?

640
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:36,538
You must be her brother.
You are both out of your minds.

641
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:40,167
You are still impolite.

642
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,794
You must've heard.
Your sister won't marry me.

643
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,548
-So, I want to break the contract.
-Go ahead.

644
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,347
Maybe you don't see what's going on.

645
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:55,807
You have a disease.

646
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,227
Don't you know
how disadvantageous it could be?

647
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,562
How would I know?

648
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,651
PENDING APPROVAL
STRATEGIC PLANNING DEPARTMENT

649
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,110
AGREEMENT WITH DASHI TOUR

650
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:09,905
Is this it?

651
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,909
Hey, take it.

652
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:16,745
Break the contract.

653
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,709
I've been playing with you,
but I am not one to trifle with.

654
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,796
What? Played?

655
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:28,215
Why do you think I went easy on you?

656
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,384
Because you were helpful?

657
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,344
Because you were scary?

658
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,304
No.

659
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:36,515
The only reason was

660
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,350
because of my sister.

661
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:42,312
Now that my sister has removed
you from her life,

662
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:46,358
I have no reason to put up with you.

663
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,950
So what are you trying to do now?

664
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:58,370
Trash needs to be treated like trash.

665
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:02,958
You, you...

666
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,002
Don't you dare hit me.

667
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,588
Do you think I'll just hit you?

668
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:11,174
Hey!

669
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:16,805
Why do you think I have an aquarium
big enough to fit a person?

670
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:32,946
Get out of here.

671
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:34,906
Don't come near her, again.

672
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,325
If you show up in front of my sister,

673
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:40,037
you'll be dead.

674
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,330
Not only you,

675
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,959
but your company will die, too.

676
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:52,507
Ju-hwan, the guest is leaving.

677
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:02,476
Why would you want to do
an autograph event now?

678
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,685
I told you not to do it.

679
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,271
It is a good time to work.

680
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,232
Showing my face like this is even better.

681
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:13,528
My fans feel assured
when they see my face in person.

682
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:17,783
That's because you trained them
so well for many years.

683
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:20,952
She's Han Se-gye!

684
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,537
You're so pretty!

685
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:23,955
-Gosh!
-It's Han Se-gye!

686
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:28,794
HAN SE-GYE AUTOGRAPH EVENT

687
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:36,551
You're so pretty! Thank you!

688
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:41,973
-I'm a fan! Thank you!
-Thank you.

689
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:43,934
Thank you!

690
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:49,356
Do you see my eyes?

691
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,191
What about them? Do they hurt?

692
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,154
You make me work overnight.
My company doesn't even do that to me.

693
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,448
I got red eyes.

694
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,535
Please, stop causing trouble.

695
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:03,912
I stay up all night,
writing comments online.

696
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:07,415
Sorry. There's nothing I can say.

697
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,169
But this guy is worth fighting for.

698
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:12,879
He is a chaebol!

699
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:18,468
If we get sued for fighting for you,
wouldn't he pay for the lawsuit?

700
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:22,472
If that happens, call my agency.
I will pay.

701
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:24,641
Gosh.

702
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:28,937
If you hadn't been such a good actress,
I could've stopped being your fan.

703
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,939
You've been saying that for ten years now.

704
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:32,566
I know.

705
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,278
By the way, are you busy after this?

706
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,904
No, not really. Why?

707
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:40,407
If you're not busy,

708
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:42,868
marry me.

709
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,580
You've been saying that
for ten years, too.

710
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:49,457
-Marry me.
-When I have more time.

711
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:58,258
I'm so lucky.

712
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:01,928
I'm loved for no reason.

713
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:04,806
I'm so lucky.

714
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,643
I'm loved by someone
who's loved for no reason.

715
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,355
What about you?

716
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:15,150
Was there anything special
about your day?

717
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:16,443
Well...

718
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,154
I did some cleaning up.

719
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:20,989
Wow, good job!

720
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,742
You cleaned up on your own!

721
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:35,962
I'm curious about something.

722
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,300
About your disease,

723
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,888
may I ask how it happened?

724
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:49,017
I thought it might hurt you too much
to ask,

725
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,230
so I couldn't.

726
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:01,863
My father was a sculptor.

727
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:07,118
He was born free-spirited.

728
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,664
While he was married to my mom,

729
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:13,416
he left for Europe by himself.

730
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:17,420
He left my mother and me behind.

731
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,008
But he was still my father.

732
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:26,930
We were family,
but we were no better than strangers.

733
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:30,934
And I heard
my father was in critical condition.

734
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:36,398
He said he wanted to see me
before he died.

735
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,543
I arrived.

736
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,878
I'm just leaving the hotel.

737
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,172
I'm on my way to the hospital.

738
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,882
I'll be there as soon as I'm done here.

739
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,552
-Sorry.
-I'll go first and wait for you.

740
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,763
Come before it's too late.

741
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,063
Faster. This way!

742
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:38,329
Do-jae!

743
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:47,922
Do-jae.

744
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:52,969
Do-jae!

745
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,273
My son,

746
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,651
hurry and wake up.

747
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:37,574
You have to wake up...

748
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,160
and see your father.

749
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,209
Do-jae!

750
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:36,549
Who... are you?

751
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,563
That was ten years ago.

752
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:05,912
I...

753
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,166
I have to go home.

754
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:12,168
Now?

755
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,426
I have something to do.

756
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:25,181
Sorry.

757
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:28,226
-I'll take you home.
-No.

758
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:30,311
It's OK.

759
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:35,733
-Then, I'll walk you to the door.
-It's OK. I'll go alone.

760
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:37,610
I can go alone.

761
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:39,904
Is this something urgent?

762
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:42,865
Yes.

763
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:44,450
I forgot about...

764
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:47,662
an urgent thing...

765
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:52,458
I forgot.

766
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:58,798
This is the bad thing
about having a successful girlfriend.

767
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:02,510
Go home safely.

768
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:04,345
Call me when you arrive.

769
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,714
You!

770
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:43,760
You don't recognize faces, do you?

771
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:46,387
How much can you recognize?
Do you recognize your family?

772
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:49,974
May I help you?

773
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:51,642
Am I not better than her?

774
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:55,730
Oh, can you not tell the difference?

775
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:58,149
You don't know how I feel, do you?

776
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:02,862
Fine. You don't even remember me.

777
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,162
I practiced while watching them.

778
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:13,289
Practice for recognizing different people.

779
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,166
It didn't work.

780
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:18,169
I haven't loved myself since that day.

781
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:19,754
Not even once.

782
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,758
How can I say that

783
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:26,135
when I'm such a mess?

784
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:27,678
It's not OK for me.

785
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:32,225
I want to see you.

786
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:35,978
I just want to recognize you.

787
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:40,858
What will I do?

788
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,655
I'm so sorry. What should I do?

789
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:14,600
I don't deserve to be with him.

790
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:18,479
How dare I smile? How dare I be happy?

791
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:20,940
I don't deserve any of that!

792
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:16,120
FROM: UNCLE

793
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:26,547
Did you get home safely?

794
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:32,261
I should've taken you home.

795
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:36,182
I keep regretting
that I let you leave like that.

796
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:46,442
Han Se-gye?

797
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:51,322
Seo Do-jae, listen carefully.

798
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:58,663
I am the reason for your disease.

799
01:06:00,414 --> 01:06:01,582
What do you mean?

800
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:05,461
It's my fault that it happened to you.

801
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,913
It's my fault
that you have to live like this.

802
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:44,250
Saving your life was
the best thing I've ever done.

803
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:47,503
I didn't know who else I should call,
so I called you.

804
01:06:47,586 --> 01:06:48,796
I feel less lonely now.

805
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:51,465
This woman cannot live without me.

806
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:55,678
We can't be happy together.

807
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:58,472
It's our destiny. A very bad destiny.

808
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:02,643
-You love me.
-Let's break up.

809
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,315
