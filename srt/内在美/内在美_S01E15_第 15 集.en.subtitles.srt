ONE YEAR LATER

00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,934
EPISODE 15

3
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,061
The Chairwoman is here.

4
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:09,778
Hello, Mother.

5
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,115
How's Do-jae doing?

6
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,661
How did the surgery go?

7
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:21,706
Let's sit down.

8
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,005
He's recovered quite a bit. 

9
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,215
He will be back soon.

10
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,134
You've had a hard time.

11
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,304
Do-jae is the one who had a hard time.

12
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,891
He opened his eyes and saw me

13
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,476
and called me Mother.

14
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,270
That reminded me...

15
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,234
of the day when he opened his eyes
and saw me,

16
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,862
and said, "Who are you?"

17
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,544
Who could beat his stubbornness?

18
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,381
Have you spoken to Do-jae?

19
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,633
I have.

20
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:18,221
I told him if he doesn't come back soon,
Oneair will catch up with T-Road.

21
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,598
That's just like you guys.

22
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,309
I guess he will hurry up and come back.

23
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,199
So,

24
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,494
when are you going to introduce us
to your girlfriend?

25
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,419
Thanks for the breakfast. I have to go.

26
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,546
Let's watch our mouths.

27
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,923
Just a minute! Eun-ho!

28
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,009
Take this. Take it to Se-gye.

29
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:01,806
Gosh! Really!

30
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,226
Who did he get
that reserved personality from?

31
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,480
Stop pestering him.
What if he rebels again? Let him be.

32
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,941
What about him? Didn't he pester me?

33
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,736
Plus, how is this pestering?

34
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,909
What does she look like?

35
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:28,458
Well... she... is pretty.

36
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,044
Well, OK, but in what way?

37
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,218
Thanks for breakfast!

38
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,095
I'll be back later!

39
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,014
Hey, wait! Jeez!

40
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:47,810
What's wrong with both of you?
Who do these kids take after?

41
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,270
They take after you!

42
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,190
They're just like you in that...

43
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,777
they're... so pretty.

44
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:56,861
Very pretty!

45
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,823
I have high standards!

46
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,076
Thanks for breakfast!

47
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,411
I'll be back later!

48
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,747
Oh, jeez.

49
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,544
Oh, my. I'm so curious.

50
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,223
Hey.

51
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,476
Oh, hi. You are here!

52
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:31,688
I'll go with you.

53
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,856
-You can't go.
-Why not?

54
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,859
I miss Se-gye.
And I miss Gging-ggang, too.

55
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,736
I said no.

56
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:43,616
You are too good looking
to show up in a country town.

57
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,120
You draw too much attention.
She went there to stay quiet.

58
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,123
Well then, tell her to come to Seoul.

59
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,626
Just wait. I'll bring her right back.

60
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,838
Does she look OK?

61
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:01,217
In the beginning, she was horrible.

62
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,885
But she is fine now.

63
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,345
Now she looks alive.

64
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:08,975
I haven't touched the money she sent
last time.

65
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,769
Let her know that she just needs
to tell me if she needs it.

66
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,147
Hey, you have to study.

67
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,149
Just use it. She wanted to give it to you.

68
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,567
Or donate it.

69
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,985
How can I do that?

70
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,112
She worked hard to make that money.

71
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,157
She can make it again.

72
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,493
Are you going to make her come back?

73
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,495
Even if I don't,

74
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,581
she is going to come back.

75
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,124
Acting is her calling.

76
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,709
She can't ignore it.

77
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,753
It's just a matter of time.

78
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:38,629
I'm going.

79
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,715
-Drive carefully.
-OK.

80
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,389
I want to see her, too.

81
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,858
Does her daughter live here
after retirement?

82
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,735
I thought she rented the place.

83
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,111
An old lady lives there.

84
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,697
I saw her come out the other night.

85
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,532
No, there's a kid there.

86
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,244
The old lady
and the kid must live there together.

87
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:15,249
Then who's the young lady I saw?

88
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,085
Oh, I got it.

89
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:21,339
The kid's mother sent the kid to live
with his grandma, and she comes and goes.

90
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,925
-Oh, yeah, that must be it.
-That's it.

91
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,860
-Hello.
-Hello.

92
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,821
Hello.

93
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,572
Looks like she's back.

94
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,117
You're pretty.

95
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,578
-She must be his mom.
-Yeah, it seems so.

96
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,122
She looks so young.

97
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,832
-Go, go!
-Let's go!

98
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,258
Oh, you're here?

99
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:07,176
Yes.

100
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:11,639
Am I visiting a friend's place
or a knitting club?

101
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,893
Why don't you get a TV or something?

102
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:16,811
I don't want to.

103
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:21,149
Why not? Because if you watch it,
you'll want to go back to that?

104
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,734
You'll think, "I can do better than that."

105
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:25,987
What's that?

106
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,030
Eun-ho's mom sent it for you.

107
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,324
Oh, I appreciate it so much!

108
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,577
He wanted to come, too,
so I had to stop him.

109
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,120
I miss him.

110
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:39,000
I think Eun-ho misses Gging-ggang
more than you.

111
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,381
Gging-ggang is so charming. Right?

112
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,511
Here's what you asked for.

113
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,429
Oh!

114
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,433
Are you happy now?

115
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:01,105
I'm not sure if I represent
an entertainment company or a publisher.

116
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,775
Lately I meet more publishers
than directors.

117
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,488
They liked it, though.

118
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,824
These days, the books you read sell well.

119
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:12,950
Thank you, always.

120
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,164
Even when you are stuck here,

121
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,124
you still want to act, don't you?

122
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,169
You feel better when you read books
for people, right?

123
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,839
Your calling is acting.

124
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,468
-Should I retract your decision?
-No, don't.

125
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,637
I'm just bored. That's all.

126
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,182
Are you really not going to step outside?

127
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,309
Is this how you want to live?

128
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,603
-I go outside.
-No.

129
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,065
I mean are you not going to go out
with your own face?

130
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,496
You said you will knit a stitch
every time you miss him.

131
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,708
The yarn color changed.
You must've used one up.

132
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,086
You must miss him so much.

133
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,379
How many did you knit?

134
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,800
This is for you.

135
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,847
Can scrubbing sponges be knitted?

136
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,641
Wow, you are so mean.

137
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,521
Oh, my gosh. You are so frustrating.

138
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,358
Why are you so loyal?

139
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,112
Really.

140
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,366
I can't believe you knitted me
a scrubbing sponge.

141
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,451
Oof!

142
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,874
What you are taking a picture of?

143
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,254
Oh! You are really good at doing things
with your hands.

144
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,091
The sponge is so pretty.
I wanted to show it off on my SNS.

145
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:53,843
Whatever.

146
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,932
Sponge! There it is.

147
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:12,612
It's done.

148
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,868
Was he about this size?

149
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,205
No?

150
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,251
Was he too thin for this?

151
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,519
I miss him.

152
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,117
STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN

153
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,870
-You are recovering well.
-You scared me by saying 5% success rate.

154
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,581
It was 5% ten years ago.

155
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,960
Now it has reached to at least about 20%.

156
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:14,423
I'm fortunate that I didn't decide
to do it then, and decided to do it now.

157
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:19,011
Why did you suddenly want the surgery
after living like that for ten years?

158
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,888
To be able to recognize or not is

159
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,724
not important to me anymore.

160
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:28,020
But... someone keeps crying.

161
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,731
That is important to me.

162
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,276
I've known you for a long time,

163
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,779
but I see your face now
for the first time.

164
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,322
So, what do you think of it?

165
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,825
It's good to see you.

166
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,668
Hi, you're here!

167
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,796
You look really good!

168
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,965
I'm good. Really.

169
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,009
You still need to be tested.

170
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,636
You are so strict.

171
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,638
I work as much as I get paid.

172
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,234
Mother.

173
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,157
Grandpa.

174
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,083
Father.

175
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,216
Sa-ra.

176
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,522
-Don't you recognize him?
-Has this picture...

177
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,318
been retouched?

178
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,862
What are you talking about?

179
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,282
-Is it obvious?
-Of course it is.

180
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,913
You look better in real life,
Jeong Ju-hwan.

181
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,043
You did great. Perfect score!

182
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,471
MESSAGE FROM: YOU U-MI

183
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,681
Se-gye is doing fine.

184
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,767
Are you doing OK, too?

185
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,755
Se-gye refuses to go outside.

186
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,342
I'm worried about her being like that.

187
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:17,124
Since I don't want your teary eyes
to be my last memory of you,

188
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,878
I'm making a decision to prevent that.

189
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,089
I wanted to see you before I go,

190
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,884
but I didn't want you to cry.

191
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,930
So I'm leaving after looking at you
from afar.

192
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,475
Frankly, I'm scared.

193
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,978
But I'm more scared of a life
without you.

194
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:42,608
So, I will be back.

195
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,527
Until I come back,

196
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,405
you just wait for me.

197
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,370
No matter what it takes,
hang in there.

198
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,014
Are you doing well?

199
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,184
As you said,

200
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,813
I'm hanging in here.

201
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:14,366
INTERNATIONAL ARRIVALS
FLIGHT BA 017 8:50 FROM STOCKHOLM

202
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,206
That was a long trip.

203
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,751
Where are you headed?

204
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,502
To my mother.

205
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,434
The commercial was successful.

206
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:44,271
While you were not here,
she contributed to the increase in sales.

207
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,106
She is just a hot issue.

208
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,359
We were so fortunate that she shot
that commercial before she left.

209
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,403
Ju-hwan.

210
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,488
Yes?

211
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,115
Is Han Se-gye pretty?

212
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,702
Well, she is.

213
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,579
She is not my type, though.

214
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,665
I'm envious that you've seen her.

215
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,043
You're going to see her soon.

216
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:05,769
I'm back...

217
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,939
mother.

218
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,157
My mother is beautiful,

219
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,952
ten years ago, and still today.

220
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,706
I'm old now because of you.

221
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:02,951
Brother!

222
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,329
I like your seat. I want it.

223
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:07,956
Are you back?

224
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,925
So this is what my sister looks like.

225
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,887
I thought you would look scary.

226
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,015
But you just have a cute, round face.

227
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,396
-Did you come back to pick a fight?
-No, I'm greeting you.

228
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,109
Welcome back to work.

229
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,697
I'm not back to work yet.

230
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,533
I have something to take care of
before going back to work.

231
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,797
Oh, my brother is back.

232
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,340
Seo Do-jae?

233
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,634
Is he OK?

234
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,555
He is too OK,

235
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,392
which is disadvantageous to me.

236
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,269
I think

237
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,188
Han Se-gye will come back soon.

238
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,818
As far as I know,

239
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,070
Seo Do-jae has never let go
of something he wants.

240
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:24,116
You're talking badly, but you look happy.

241
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,414
So, speaking of you,

242
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:33,166
how are you going to make a living now?

243
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,545
You can't work part-time
for the rest of your life.

244
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,300
If you don't want to work,
you don't have to.

245
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,468
I have lots of money.

246
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,348
I want to go to graduate school.

247
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,852
Graduate school?

248
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,277
What do you want to be this time?

249
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,406
I've been thinking about it,

250
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:08,577
and I think being a judge will fit
my personality.

251
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:16,335
That's very, very hard.

252
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,295
Yes.

253
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:22,382
I don't think it will be easy.
It's been a while since I studied.

254
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,802
I think it will take some time,
don't you think?

255
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:32,392
Oh, I don't think I've told you.

256
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,811
I studied law
at Seoul National University.

257
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:39,733
Are you OK?

258
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:48,325
Seoul National University Law School.

259
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:55,624
Were you surprised?

260
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:57,918
No.

261
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,255
I will take out the fish bones for you.

262
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,266
Eat.

263
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,523
I think I told you I was smart.

264
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,903
I didn't know that's what you meant.

265
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,699
Now I understand why your mom objected
to you being a priest.

266
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,786
Let me out there.

267
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,873
If you drop me off right in front
of my house, my family will go nuts.

268
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:37,958
Why?

269
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,002
They are dying to meet you.

270
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,756
Then, we can meet.

271
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,467
Is that OK?

272
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:54,516
Why? Am I not presentable?

273
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:58,061
No, I thought you might feel burdened.

274
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:04,651
The burden should be yours
and your family's.

275
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,070
You met someone like me.

276
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,781
I even take you home in this nice car.

277
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,625
You're right.

278
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:24,671
Now that I think of it,
it's a little burdensome.

279
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:30,844
How did I meet such an amazing
and capable woman?

280
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,683
It's your fortune and fate.

281
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,814
You are saying words
like "fortune" and "fate."

282
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:45,734
That's surprising.

283
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,822
There will be more surprises
in the future.

284
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,616
So stop being surprised and get out.

285
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,117
I'm tired.

286
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,035
OK.

287
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,706
You have to pay for the ride.

288
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,887
Why? You don't even want to give me
this little bit?

289
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,651
I'll go now.

290
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:49,798
How did I... get bewitched by him?

291
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,250
Put it here.

292
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,883
You are silly,
making me do stuff like this.

293
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,468
Thank you for your praise.

294
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,763
-When are you going back to work?
-I don't want to work.

295
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:40,807
You do it for me.

296
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:44,102
Oh, poor me!

297
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,322
He was right.

298
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,908
Her face is unnecessarily fair.

299
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,828
Her lips are unnecessarily red.

300
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,743
I love that these books are read
by many different people.

301
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,370
I'm enjoying the book.

302
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:47,123
The voice of the frequent reader sounds
like Han Se-gye, doesn't it?

303
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,334
The voice is so easy to listen to.

304
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,252
Her voice sounds like Han Se-gye.

305
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,361
-Are you really OK without me?
-You need a rest, too,

306
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,196
from following me around all the time.

307
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:22,200
I'm glad you recognize faces now,
but this hurts my feelings.

308
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,703
I was always next to you,
but you're fine all alone now.

309
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,539
-Aren't you going to ask where I'm going?
-I already know.

310
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:30,792
-Then, wish me the best luck.
-I already know the result, too.

311
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,336
I wish I knew the result, too.

312
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,172
I will head to the company
and organize things for you.

313
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,550
So have fun until you resume your work.

314
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,552
OK. Thank you.

315
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,595
-Director!
-Yes.

316
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,305
Good luck!

317
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,391
OK!

318
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,858
Yes, I'm on my way to a bookstore
to get some books.

319
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:58,319
I feel bad about only taking Gging-ggang
out to the yard.

320
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:02,574
-So I'm taking her out for a walk.
-Sure, that is a great idea!

321
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,159
Get some air.

322
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,368
I'll be back soon.

323
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,954
Don't be back soon.
Take all the time you want.

324
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:11,332
What if the town makes a fuss about me?

325
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,586
If that happens, I will calm them down.

326
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,590
So take all the time you want.
Stay out for as long as you want.

327
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,134
I'm really good at sorting things out.

328
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,220
OK. Bye.

329
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:59,339
Gging-ggang, I will be back soon.
Wait here just for a minute.

330
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,378
Is it because
you haven't seen me for a while?

331
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,089
You are not barking.

332
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:11,429
Thank you.

333
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:28,321
Gging-ggang, stay calm.

334
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,244
No! Oh, dear!

335
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,502
MEETING THE WORLD AGAIN

336
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,087
Oh, thank you.

337
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,474
My arm is getting tired.

338
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:12,782
So this is what you look like.

339
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:18,955
I told you not to run away...

340
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,294
Can you really recognize me?

341
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,673
For real? Are you sure?

342
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:11,966
For real.

343
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,468
How is it possible?

344
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,428
How can you?

345
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,305
I promised you

346
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,766
I would take care of everything.

347
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:23,102
If my disease saddens you,

348
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,772
I said I will take care of it.

349
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,648
You said it was incurable.

350
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,068
The success rate was low.

351
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:32,445
How low?

352
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,032
Well... about 20%?

353
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,201
It was 5% ten years ago.

354
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,203
-You're crazy.
-Gosh.

355
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:43,289
You're insane.
What if it had cost your life?

356
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,958
You are the one who is crazy.

357
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,878
How were you going to live without me?

358
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:52,048
Why did you do such a thing for me?
I'm nothing.

359
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:56,427
You are the one
I risked my life for twice.

360
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:04,769
Pay me back for the rest of your life.
I did it all because of you.

361
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,855
So you take care of me
for the rest of your life.

362
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,194
I will do that for the rest of my life.

363
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,824
I will do anything you want me to do.

364
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:20,827
You might regret it.

365
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,623
I have something that
I've been wanting to do with you.

366
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:27,750
What is it?

367
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,890
What... what is it?

368
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:53,109
Please spare my life. It's me, Ok-jeong.

369
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:07,373
Are you OK? Aren't you tired?

370
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:08,833
Shh... Be quiet.

371
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,252
I'm watching a movie now.

372
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,963
I've been waiting for so long
to watch this with you.

373
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:17,383
Look at me.

374
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,468
I can look at you any time.

375
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,138
Please look at me.

376
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,435
Jeez.

377
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,646
I was trying so hard to hold back.

378
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,378
Did you really knit this yourself?

379
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,130
Yes, I really did.

380
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:57,506
All of these?

381
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,133
Yes, all of these.

382
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,139
Oh, it fits just right. Good!

383
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:08,684
Did you always think of me
except when you were sleeping?

384
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,395
No, I thought about you
even when I was asleep.

385
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,450
Why?

386
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,618
Just because.

387
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,496
I want the sweater to smell like you.

388
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,666
No need to worry about it.

389
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,460
I thought it was you.

390
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,297
I hugged it in my sleep
whenever I missed you.

391
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,687
When you left the letter,

392
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,107
I ran to see you.

393
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,902
But you weren't there.

394
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,656
The day I ran away?

395
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,287
I wasn't sure if I could bear to see
your crying face,

396
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:14,125
so... I ran away that day.

397
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,676
Is it really OK for me to do this?

398
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:31,851
Like this... so shamelessly?

399
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,025
I'm the one who is shameless.

400
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:46,407
I'm asking you to be responsible for me
taking risks.

401
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,245
I regret making that decision.

402
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,499
I left.

403
00:38:57,418 --> 00:39:00,504
So I wasn't there for you when you had
the hardest time of your life.

404
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,800
I regret it so much.

405
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,264
Because of my decision,

406
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:15,269
I almost lost you and me.

407
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,566
I was bad.

408
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:23,778
No.

409
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:29,283
You were just very hurt.

410
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,665
It's OK.

411
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,545
I'm here.

412
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,323
Don't run away.

413
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,367
I won't run away,

414
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:55,953
forever.

415
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:01,959
But if you want to run away,
you can go any time.

416
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,254
I will go and catch you.

417
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,715
I will catch you to the end.

418
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:13,679
-I will come back for you.
-You don't have to.

419
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,098
I will go.

420
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,059
So,

421
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:22,646
wait there.

422
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:31,632
Hi, U-mi.

423
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,219
I'm going to go to Seoul.

424
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:39,265
I went to see her.

425
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:40,766
Se-gye?

426
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:41,684
Yes.

427
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,061
Was she doing well?

428
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:48,607
She wasn't... doing well.

429
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,111
I thought so.

430
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,240
Will you be OK?

431
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:01,036
She left you once.
Will you be OK with her?

432
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,456
No, that's not it.

433
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:07,835
That's not it...

434
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:14,592
I will tell you someday.

435
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:19,096
You called me
because you were worried

436
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:21,849
that I might be against you meeting her,
right?

437
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:25,686
She is buried
under so much misunderstanding.

438
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:28,439
She's not that kind of person.

439
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:32,026
Her situation makes her be misunderstood.

440
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,072
You do what you want.

441
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:43,037
I won't decide your life anymore.

442
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:46,415
There must be good reasons
for all your decisions.

443
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:51,503
I'll just watch and reach out to you
when you need me.

444
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:52,963
Mother.

445
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,591
I'm just glad you are alive.

446
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,470
Do what you want. Whatever that is.

447
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:02,556
Thank you.

448
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,729
When do you officially go back to work?

449
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,119
Hello, President.

450
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,455
Welcome back, President.

451
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:28,999
How's everyone been?

452
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,671
T-ROAD AIR BUSINESS PLAN

453
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:41,178
Now, let's begin the discussion
we've been postponing.

454
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,945
-Gosh.
-Hey!

455
00:44:58,278 --> 00:44:59,363
Are you doing well?

456
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,782
Of course not. What do you think?

457
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:05,202
While you were gone,
U-mi bullied me so much.

458
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,496
-She got mad at me all the time--
-Hey!

459
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:11,625
-When did I get mad at you?
-See? She yells and curses at me.

460
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,086
I had such a hard time without you.

461
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,547
He needs some beatings.

462
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,049
I was too nice to you? Wasn't I?

463
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,135
-Come here! Come on!
-No.

464
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,137
What did you say, jerk?

465
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,515
You deserve all this
for making things up.

466
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:28,642
You saw that.

467
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,978
She hits me and looks down on me.

468
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:34,273
I really don't like You U-mi.

469
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:36,942
You are all I have.

470
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:38,902
It feels like I'm home now.

471
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:40,654
You've lost so much weight.

472
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:44,241
I didn't lose too much
thanks to your mom's food.

473
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,326
Please thank her for me.

474
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:50,122
Do it yourself.
My mom misses you a lot, too.

475
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,959
She's been so sad to have lost
her Go-Stop partner.

476
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,003
I should go and lose
a lot of money for her.

477
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,130
Hey all!

478
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,382
What should we do after unpacking?

479
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,427
How about a long-awaited drink? OK?

480
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,137
No. I have to go somewhere.

481
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:06,638
Did you see?

482
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:09,391
He's been like this
since he started dating.

483
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:12,352
Traitor!

484
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,689
-Then, just two of us...
-Sorry.

485
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:17,775
I have somewhere to go, too.

486
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:20,152
Look at you two!

487
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:23,405
Do you think I don't have a boyfriend?

488
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:24,990
I have one, too!

489
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:28,994
Gosh, really.

490
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:33,165
Hi, sweetie. it's me.

491
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,626
Are you busy later?

492
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:39,171
You are? Think again!

493
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,589
What happened to that room?

494
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:43,342
-What?
-That room. It was full of frames.

495
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:44,593
It was completely empty.

496
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,449
I was about to pick you up.

497
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:11,537
That's why I came to wait.

498
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,337
I feel like I was always the one
who received.

499
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:25,509
I don't know what to do.
I've never been given flowers.

500
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,845
I've received flowers many times,
so I know.

501
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:31,807
There's nothing much.
You just take it with a bright face.

502
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,519
You really know how to drive me crazy.

503
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:43,026
I became the president of the company.

504
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,822
Today was my first day as president.

505
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:50,576
Is that right?
Then, flowers are just the perfect gift.

506
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,745
What would you like
for a congratulations gift?

507
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,922
Do you want to eat ramen at my house?

508
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:49,259
The pictures were all here.

509
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:52,012
After you left,

510
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,682
I wanted to take your picture
from your place,

511
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:59,895
but I wasn't able to tell
which one was your picture.

512
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:03,065
But then,

513
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,776
they were all you.

514
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:08,737
So...

515
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:21,792
Now... you must have seen all my faces.

516
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:23,752
I have.

517
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:29,675
I was happy to be able to see all of them.

518
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:36,139
Maybe it will be harder for you,

519
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,978
as you can recognize the real me now.

520
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:48,235
I always just give you a hard time.

521
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:50,153
Don't worry.

522
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:53,240
It's not your looks I'm in love with.

523
00:49:59,079 --> 00:49:59,955
I'm in love with...

524
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:06,670
who you are inside.

525
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:14,094
How did a person like you come to me?

526
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:16,304
No.

527
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,891
You are the one who came to me.

528
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:24,938
You came to me.

529
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,998
How did you know I was reading the books?

530
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:44,708
Well...

531
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:49,921
President You is your friend,
but she has become my friend, too.

532
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,215
And Eun-ho is my brother now.

533
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:57,929
Once they befriend someone,
they are loyal.

534
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,306
That's how they are.

535
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:03,852
I listened every time
I wanted to hear your voice.

536
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,689
I probably posted about 30 comments.

537
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:14,071
Anyway, I didn't know
you really wanted to eat ramen.

538
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,783
What? Did you expect something else?

539
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:19,993
No, not really.

540
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:23,747
So these were the eyes
with dark intention!

541
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,249
That's not true.

542
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,376
I told you not to let it be discovered.

543
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:31,797
-Oh my goodness, that's really not true.
-Oh my goodness, that's really true.

544
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:38,512
It was good ramen.

545
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,100
You cook really good ramen.

546
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:44,768
Sleep here tonight.

547
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:48,772
Why? You don't want to?

548
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:51,608
Why do you suddenly say such a thing
while we're eating ramen?

549
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:53,652
Then, should I have timed it better?

550
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:56,154
Didn't you say timing is everything?

551
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,577
I've been wanting to ask you.

552
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:07,833
What's that?

553
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:12,963
Isn't it obvious?

554
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:14,714
My girlfriend.

555
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,884
Why is she your girlfriend?
I'm your girlfriend.

556
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:23,849
I have a wish.

557
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,893
A wish? What is it?

558
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,229
Tell me.
I will grant whatever wishes you have.

559
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:32,858
I want to see your movie.

560
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:35,193
Movie? Again?

561
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,904
OK. Sure. What do you want to watch?

562
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:41,241
I mean... the movies
I've already seen are not fun anymore.

563
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,828
I want to see your new movie.

564
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:51,710
Just listening to your voice
is not enough for me anymore.

565
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,133
Will you do that for me?

566
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,265
You are a good girl.

567
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,226
And a good listener.

568
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:15,335
President, you know me. You U-mi.
The You U-mi of World Entertainment.

569
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,003
Don't you trust my sharp eyes?

570
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:21,883
No, they've been proven by Han Se-gye.

571
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,594
But the movie will be on a big scale.

572
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,389
Ordinary actors or actresses won't fit.

573
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:31,476
Also, the director wants
a seasoned actress.

574
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,980
That's what I'm saying.
That's why you have to trust me.

575
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,817
For you to talk so highly of her,

576
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,277
she must be a good one.

577
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:45,782
OK. Fine.

578
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:47,534
Let me see her.

579
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,661
You won't regret it.

580
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:52,998
I told her to be on time.

581
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:56,960
You're here.

582
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,379
Hello, President.

583
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:01,840
It's been a while.

584
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,508
So what do you think?

585
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,469
A really good and seasoned actress!

586
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,433
Let's sign the contract!

587
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:13,643
Immediately!

588
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:46,968
Cut! OK!

589
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,348
Good job!

590
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:52,849
Was I OK?

591
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:56,561
Of course! You did excellent!

592
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:57,979
You are the actress Han!

593
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:02,025
You have no idea
how long I've been itching for this.

594
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:04,194
She retired and came back just like that?

595
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,280
How convenient!
She can live any way she likes.

596
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,990
Why did she retire in the first place?

597
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:11,326
She should've just said
she was going to take a break.

598
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,286
Excuse me!

599
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:14,996
It's fine.

600
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:31,262
What can I do?

601
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:32,847
That's what I did.

602
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,850
I should take responsibility
for what I did.

603
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:38,561
Han Se-gye!

604
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:41,314
Let's wrap it up for now.

605
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,399
Already?

606
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,901
"Already"?
We are done early, thanks to you.

607
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:48,655
And, your boyfriend is waiting there.

608
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,407
Really?

609
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:01,000
Your uncle always makes a big deal.

610
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:05,046
If he follows you all the time like this,
his company will go bankrupt.

611
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,885
-What's this?
-A contract.

612
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,975
MODEL CONTRACT

613
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:21,187
I'm offering this
as the president of the company.

614
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,607
Sign the contract and be T-Road's model.

615
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:27,110
Why do you give it to me?
You should give it to President You.

616
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:29,070
She is picky.

617
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,489
She refused to sign
even though we're friends.

618
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,409
What's a girlfriend good for?

619
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,661
Put in a good word for me.

620
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,663
Is this a solicitation?

621
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:40,290
If it is, will you report me?

622
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,168
Do you have a pen?

623
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,379
Here.

624
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,135
NAME: HAN SE-GYE

625
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:59,142
Mr. Client.
I will do my best to please you.

626
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:01,978
What did I tell you?

627
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:05,857
Didn't I tell you to examine details
of contracts before signing them?

628
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:07,775
What?

629
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:14,657
If requested, you must accompany me
on business trips.

630
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:19,162
While accompanying me,
you must wear a red dress.

631
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:20,914
Again? When?

632
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:22,790
Well, whenever.

633
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,126
When will your shooting end?

634
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,337
Why do you keep asking for a red dress?

635
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,005
You don't even need me
to wear it anymore.

636
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:30,798
The truth is,

637
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:34,052
I've dreamt about a woman in a red dress.

638
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:36,971
You are helpless!

639
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,850
It's almost similar today, too.

640
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,978
-This is pink!
-Sure.

641
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:45,730
-It's pink.
-Sure.

642
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:21,284
I can have this face.

643
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:25,622
Or this face.

644
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,047
I could change to any of these faces.

645
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:37,967
Will you still be OK with me?

646
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:40,637
You've done this before.

647
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:44,515
Bet your life, and trust me.

648
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:20,218
Get out and go on a date with me,
Mr. Han Se Gye's boyfriend.

649
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:23,054
I'll call you when I'm done.
Or not.

650
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,307
He's too considerate.

651
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:28,559
He only calls me
when I'm done with my work.

652
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:31,312
Are you bragging right now?

653
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:32,730
Do you have a boyfriend?

654
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:34,148
She does.

655
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:37,193
So, now it's time to love

656
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:41,406
myself and you.

657
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:47,078
