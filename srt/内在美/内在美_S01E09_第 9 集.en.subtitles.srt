1
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,301
Nothing is wrong.

2
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,053
EPISODE 9

3
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,554
I see.

4
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:57,348
Precisely where and how does it hurt?

5
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,603
Unexplainable pain is a great suffering.

6
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,493
A bad one is inside you.

7
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,998
Something serious will happen.

8
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,501
Something serious will happen.

9
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:28,088
I wanted to find a reason at that time.

10
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,342
I did everything to get fixed.

11
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,553
I got charms and exorcisms
more than a dozen times.

12
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,932
Woman, man,

13
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,184
child,

14
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,520
old lady,

15
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,857
and all other ghosts

16
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:51,820
sitting in your head for fun,

17
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,738
go away!

18
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,490
Go away!

19
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,410
Get out. Get out!

20
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,038
OK. Using the fire,

21
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,458
I will burn you all out!

22
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,460
Go away.

23
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:08,711
Go away.

24
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:17,011
As the unexplainable suffering got longer,

25
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:20,515
I started wanting to blame something
for no reason,

26
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,935
such as a quirk of fate.

27
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,945
I wanted to blame God if there was one.

28
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,277
I wanted to blame all the wrongs I did.

29
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,655
I wanted to blame someone
who would still love me,

30
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,908
even if I hated her.

31
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,431
What are you doing?

32
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,350
Sleep.

33
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,395
You woke me up.

34
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,397
And you are the one who woke me up.

35
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,984
Why did you excercise this much?

36
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,029
I don't understand you.

37
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,114
I know.

38
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,868
I also want to understand myself.

39
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,872
You gave birth to me,
so you should know me best.

40
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,500
Stop!

41
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,795
How can I stop?

42
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:19,259
Whenever you moan, my heart falls apart.

43
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,095
When you hurt,

44
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,889
I feel like it's my fault,

45
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,352
I feel like you are being punished
for my wrongs.

46
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,730
If it's possible,

47
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,857
I want to be sick, instead of you.

48
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,861
How would you understand?

49
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,739
I made a decision that night,

50
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,076
not to be my mom's punishment.

51
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,956
I would not tell my mom

52
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,333
about this horrible sickness

53
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,170
forever, if possible.

54
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,589
Han Se-gye, mom is here.

55
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,924
Mom?

56
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,634
Mom!

57
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:17,984
Who is this?

58
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:23,573
Being discovered this way was
never part of my plan.

59
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,034
He is my newphew.

60
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,873
He must miss his mom.
He is looking for his mom...

61
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,584
Nephew? But you are an only child.

62
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,467
I have an X sister.
Do you know about X sisters and stuff?

63
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,636
-Were you a problem kid at school?
-No, that is not it...

64
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,391
In fact, I'm raising him...

65
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,310
You just said he was
your X sister's brother.

66
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:56,147
Yes, that's what I'm saying.
I am my X sister's little sister.

67
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,274
To sum up,

68
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,527
she is sick

69
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,030
and hospitalized right now.

70
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,324
Where is his dad?
Why are you taking care of him?

71
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:12,372
He... My X sister...

72
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,874
is a single mom.

73
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,753
Men never take responsibility.

74
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,715
Kid, you grow well, find your dad,
and pay him back.

75
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,050
I will help you.

76
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,470
My mom sure is aggressive.

77
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:33,518
You still should not bring a kid
to this house.

78
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,894
That's how rumors start.

79
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,314
Don't worry. I hid him really well.

80
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:42,276
Now I just need to hide him well
to get out.

81
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,277
Where is Se-gye?

82
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,239
-She went to another town for shooting.
-So why you are here?

83
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,324
I dropped by to get her stuff.

84
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,495
I'm late. I will go.

85
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,038
Come with me.

86
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,458
Leave him here.

87
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,298
I will take care of him.

88
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,552
Will you take him to the town?
There will be more rumors.

89
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,389
I will keep him here,
so come back quickly.

90
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,559
Is it OK to be with me?

91
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,770
I'm not OK.

92
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:22,775
Y... you don't... have to.

93
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,111
How can you take care of him
while you're working?

94
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,364
I will take care of him,
so you take care of my daughter.

95
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,243
We... well, that is...

96
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,328
Come here.

97
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,046
Say bye bye to her.

98
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,882
Say "Bye bye, X Auntie."

99
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,927
X Auntie,

100
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,472
bye bye.

101
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,019
I hope nothing happens.

102
00:07:58,853 --> 00:07:59,979
Will you come and save me?

103
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,817
People would think he is your kid.

104
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,111
What kind of good-bye is
this passionate?

105
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:27,757
Let's go.

106
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,805
Friend, please do not forget about me.

107
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,110
I have a gloomy future.

108
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,363
My heart is burning.

109
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,790
OK, let's eat.

110
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,085
What's your name?

111
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,461
Se...

112
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,089
Se?

113
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,092
-Woo-ju.
-Se Woo-ju?

114
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,511
My name is Seo Woo-ju.

115
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:16,639
Let's see.

116
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,059
Do you like stuff like this?

117
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,945
My daughter also liked stuff like that
when she was about your age.

118
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:35,241
Back then, I didn't have money,
so I could only afford veggies.

119
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,868
It still hurts.

120
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,709
Oh, look at you.

121
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,003
How can you make that face
like you understand?

122
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,424
But strangely,

123
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,010
I kind of liked it.

124
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,011
OK, let's eat.

125
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,818
I can do it by myself.

126
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,406
Kids these days learn quickly.

127
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,951
Se-gye could not go to the bathroom
by herself at that age.

128
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,954
I can't talk on the phone now.

129
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,498
It's that day.

130
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,583
Shall I come over now?

131
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,627
-No! Don't come!
-Why?

132
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,504
Who did you turn into? It's fine.

133
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,548
I will recognize you.

134
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,967
That's why I'm scared.

135
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,595
I have pride, too.

136
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,640
What you said just makes me more curious.

137
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,100
Remember Clause 3
in the Confidential Agreement?

138
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:47,521
"Phone calls shall be answered actively,
when necessary, and cooperatively."

139
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,857
I'll call you if I need you.
Until then, stay tuned.

140
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,484
You said I shouldn't come.

141
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,111
That is why I said "If " I need you.

142
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,572
Sleep with your phone in your hand.

143
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,199
Please try to keep my secret.

144
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,618
If not, I will sue you
for breaking the contract.

145
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,330
Who should I keep the secret from?

146
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,248
Woo-ju! Are you OK?

147
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,042
Does your tummy hurt a lot?

148
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,337
Time's up. I got to go.
Don't call me for a while.

149
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,714
I'm done.

150
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,305
Did I just get dumped?

151
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,973
That is a good news.

152
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,101
Check your fish.

153
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,109
I chose a name for that one.

154
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,196
I don't want to hear it.

155
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,699
-Why?
-Because I already know what it is.

156
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,746
Loser buys coffee. OK?

157
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,832
-OK.
-OK.

158
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,083
Fold if you are a man.

159
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,544
Fold if you are over 35.

160
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,422
Fold if you are a team leader or above.

161
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,507
-Hey!
-Hurry and fold.

162
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,634
You guys want to play so unfairly?

163
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,678
Fold if you are lower than team leader.

164
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,514
Fold if your hair is above your neck.

165
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,102
Fold if your ears are not pierced.

166
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:11,313
That is way too unfair!

167
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,774
It's too one-sided, don't you think?

168
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,776
Why aren't you folding your finger?

169
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,447
Did you get your ear pierced?

170
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,948
I did it last weekend.

171
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,492
What kid of man pierces his ears?

172
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:27,121
You are so old-fashioned. Who doesn't get
their ears pierced these days?

173
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,415
One person here didn't.

174
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,168
Buy coffee now.

175
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:35,296
Call this off. You ganged up on me!

176
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:39,300
If only you had more interest
in your team members.

177
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:42,219
How can I notice pierced ears on a man?

178
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,888
Even the Director wouldn't notice.

179
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,431
Nonsense.

180
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,559
He will notice it right away.

181
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,895
You want to bet? 50,000 won.

182
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,104
-Fine.
-Fine.

183
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,230
OK.

184
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,488
Good morning, Sir!

185
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,742
Good morning, Sir!

186
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,995
I guess you are taking a break.

187
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,372
A break is important.

188
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:11,832
Then...

189
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,173
By the way...

190
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,844
you got your ears pierced, Jung-min.

191
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,018
-Nice!
-I knew he would know it.

192
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,688
Give me the 50,000 won.

193
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,399
He is the man who harms men's lives.

194
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,070
What are you doing?

195
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,989
Wow, what's this? My heart is pounding.

196
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,456
My wallet... You buy.

197
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,043
Give me everything
from here to here, please.

198
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,296
This isn't so nice anymore.

199
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,049
It was for the first day.

200
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,802
Day two is...

201
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,096
driving me crazy.

202
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,310
Drink that and watch TV quietly.

203
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,480
Don't sit too close to the TV.

204
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,443
I already know that!

205
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,574
Huh? This is better than I expected.

206
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,038
But it is a little bit thrilling, too...

207
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,293
Day three.

208
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:39,837
I want to be alone.

209
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,554
What's the matter?

210
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:49,972
Is it hard to fall asleep?

211
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,896
We've been together for three days.
Am I still a stranger to you?

212
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,317
You are. Very much.

213
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:06,780
It's been almost 10 years
since we laid down together like this.

214
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,337
But it feels...

215
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:25,090
kind of relaxing...

216
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,715
Hi Eun-ho! It's been a while.

217
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,511
I'm back.

218
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,393
Wash your hands and sit there.

219
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,282
The rice is perfectly cooked today.

220
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:38,998
The veggies are perfectly salted, too.

221
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,585
I will do the dishes.

222
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,256
If you wish.

223
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,660
THEOLOGY COLLEGE ADMISSION GUIDE
2019 ACADEMIC YEAR

224
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,283
Why is she running the vacuum
so early in the morning?

225
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,578
No, my picture room. My dressing room!

226
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,216
Are you going to keep sitting there?

227
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,968
-No.
-Why?

228
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,346
You're in my chair.
You should do my work.

229
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,765
Why don't you do my work?

230
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,893
I plan to be the president
of a sister company.

231
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,728
I don't want to be the director.

232
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,772
Did my mother promise that?

233
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:15,445
First I will make sure you inherit
Sunho Group,

234
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,990
and then ask you to give it to me.

235
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,576
Have I told you I would make
you president?

236
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:24,621
You should.
Otherwise, I will reveal everything.

237
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:25,747
Reveal what?

238
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,667
When you are in love, you are a fool.
You just look at your phone all day.

239
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,553
-Hello?
-Come to my house quickly!

240
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,600
A kid?

241
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,569
-I'm out.
-OK.

242
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,781
Aren't you going to ask where I'm going?

243
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,034
No, I already know.

244
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,373
Why isn't she coming?

245
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:00,550
What's going on?

246
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,348
You could have told me,
if you needed to go to the bathroom.

247
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,059
It's OK. Don't cry.

248
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,687
My daughter wet the bed until 5th grade.

249
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,148
Wow, you wet it a lot.

250
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,161
Stop my mom, whatever it takes.

251
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,672
Why does the blanket smell like an apple?

252
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,553
Does she do the laundry on her own?

253
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,361
Oh!

254
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,239
Excuse me.

255
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:10,829
Mr.!

256
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:24,468
Are you the mother of Han Se-gye?

257
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:30,349
I am. Are you the ex-boyfriend of Se-gye?

258
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,611
Please help me see her.

259
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:47,240
She is... not here.

260
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,867
I know she is here.

261
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,078
I can't just give her up like this.

262
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,423
I like your courage.

263
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,509
But she went to another town
for shooting.

264
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:06,718
She really isn't at home.

265
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:10,097
Then, would you mind sparing time
for me?

266
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,224
I would like to, but...

267
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,393
he wet the bed.

268
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,030
I need just a little of your time.

269
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,493
Can you be alone?

270
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,997
I will be right back.
Stay with Gging-ggang.

271
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:36,915
OK.

272
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,584
-Let's go.
-Yes.

273
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:48,677
I didn't.

274
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,262
You wet the bed.

275
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,444
YOU U-MI

276
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,615
Come here right now.
We have a problem.

277
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,452
Marry her.

278
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,539
Or else, don't see her.

279
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,961
Such a decision is not easy to make.

280
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,463
Marry her this month.

281
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,590
You are impetuous.

282
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,800
I was wondering where she got that from.

283
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,761
I'm just saying,
don't play with my daughter.

284
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,683
She does not have a dad.

285
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,977
-You know that, right?
-I do.

286
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:44,649
I want her to find a boyfriend
who will stay for a long time.

287
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,987
Someone who will not die or disappear.

288
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,409
I loved the opposite kind of person.

289
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,246
It did not make me happy.

290
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:05,712
My daughter needs a man
who she can return to, like home.

291
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,089
Can you be like that?

292
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,009
If Se-gye does not change her mind.

293
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,763
She stays the same way.
I know that, as her mother.

294
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,682
She does not change.

295
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,436
Then I won't either.

296
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:29,528
She resembles you in many ways.

297
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,364
I'm prettier than her!

298
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,283
Even the way you say things!

299
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:51,007
Here, here. Jeez.

300
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:55,470
Call your boyfriend. Not me!

301
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,557
How can she call him
when she is like this?

302
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:02,852
U-mi, be honest with me.
You don't have a boyfriend, do you?

303
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:08,275
No matter how urgent this is,
I will beat you.

304
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:12,112
Wait. So, where did your mom go?

305
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,613
She left with Seo Do-jae.

306
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:16,658
What's that for?

307
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:20,495
Cooperate so that I don't look suspicious.

308
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:21,830
Cooperate how?

309
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,708
Be my guardian.

310
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:28,044
If I walk alone on the street,
people will call to the police.

311
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:31,548
Child care is more expensive.

312
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,051
You and  Gging-ggang are both 50,000 won,
which is not profitable.

313
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,636
-What...
-Stop hitting me.

314
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,810
Just do it, idiot!

315
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,229
You are ignorant...

316
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,440
and violent!

317
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,445
-Can you take care of my mom?
-OK.

318
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,034
Hi mom!

319
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,538
Is Woo-ju sleeping?

320
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,665
His mom wanted him, so I took him to her.

321
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,418
What? I didn't even get to say goodbye.

322
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:12,088
As soon as she got better,
she looked for him, so...

323
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,050
Of course.
Any mom would think of her kids first.

324
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,511
But why are you here?

325
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:22,682
I came here to pack some clothes
for Se-gye.

326
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,310
She is doing fine.

327
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,355
Her acting is improving dramatically--

328
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,899
I forgot. I was cleaning up the house.

329
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:38,073
I will... I will do it.

330
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,995
What is this room?

331
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:48,792
Work out room. It's a work out room.

332
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,090
Spread one like this, one, two three...

333
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,717
Le't see. Like this!

334
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:03,348
For her work outs,
Se-gye invites trainers and does this.

335
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,266
Pilates, like this...

336
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:11,314
and yoga, like this.

337
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,693
That's the secret of world star
Han Se-gye's body!

338
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:18,488
Is she holding a group exercise
or something? This is too much.

339
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,158
You should try it, too!

340
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,670
What did my mom say?

341
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,090
She said I should marry you this month.

342
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:42,470
I knew she would make a big deal.

343
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,475
Anyway,

344
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,645
we won't able to stay together this time.

345
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,230
I don't care.

346
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:56,693
I am... a little embarrassed.

347
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,114
Sorry, but you are cute.

348
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:08,163
Hurry up, unless you want to pay overtime.

349
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:13,668
It seems I am not the only one
who knows your secret.

350
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,088
-Did I not tell you?
-No.

351
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:25,805
Hey, you!

352
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,402
My shoulder! My shoulder!

353
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:40,820
Calm down.

354
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,491
Ju-hwan, let him go.

355
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:51,206
-What brought you here?
-What do you think? I followed you.

356
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,792
And I took some pictures for updates.

357
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,752
Isn't this good? I used natural light.

358
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,171
Why did you follow me?
You said you knew where I was going.

359
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:02,801
It was obvious, but you did not go there.
So this is so weird.

360
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:05,428
By any chance...

361
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,145
-Is he your hidden son?
-Are you crazy?

362
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:17,607
Then...

363
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:33,957
Do you want a lollipop?

364
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,927
You are cute!

365
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,806
Why do you suddenly want to be a sponsor?

366
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:53,309
Is he your son?

367
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,895
No, I'm a bachelor.

368
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,356
Isn't it prejudice
that a bachelor can't have a kid?

369
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,191
Oh, do you have a kid?

370
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,568
Never!

371
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,203
Who keeps calling me
from an unknown number?

372
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,664
I know that number. Give it to me.

373
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,673
-Stop.
-Hello, Grandpa.

374
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:24,799
Eh?

375
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:28,052
Why is the model's ex boyfriend picking up
her phone?

376
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:31,014
She is an actress, not a model!
Why did you call her?

377
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:34,601
Are you seeing her again?
Then, I have nothing to say.

378
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,395
It's not like that.
I'm meeting her for work.

379
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,814
You are so incapable.

380
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:45,236
Put the model, I mean the actress,
on the phone.

381
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,325
She cannot come to the phone right now.

382
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,827
Tell me.
I'll deliver your message to her.

383
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:57,957
Then, ask her if she needs anything.
Right now.

384
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,959
Tell her I will give her anything.

385
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,714
My grandpa asks you if need anything.
He said he will get anything for you.

386
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,008
I don't want anything.

387
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,468
She says nothing.

388
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:12,013
She is right next you!
Why are you relaying my message?

389
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,765
Put her on the phone.

390
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,767
You don't listen to me.

391
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,488
The woman you saved....

392
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:33,159
As I heard, she gave her dead son's heart

393
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,454
to another kid.

394
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,209
I just thought of something.

395
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,753
She has one now.

396
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,727
I want to get off work.

397
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,647
I want to go home.

398
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,774
Take that up with the Director.

399
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,484
He's your boss.

400
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,443
The kid is yours.

401
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,779
He is not mine.

402
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,747
Why are you looking for this kid?

403
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,917
I want to let her know...

404
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,171
that her son's heart is...

405
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,091
beating in another kid.

406
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,720
That it's still alive.

407
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,514
That it did not die.

408
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,517
So she should not die, either.

409
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:52,447
The kid who received the heart died
during the surgery.

410
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:59,120
Destiny tricks you, and God is cruel.

411
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:06,627
So, some cannot help but blaming...
themselves

412
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,173
Take me there.

413
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:14,761
Right now. I don't have a lot of time.

414
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,515
I have to take him there.

415
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,272
So, who's kid is he?

416
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,859
He is... the son of my X sister.

417
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,071
-What?
-X...

418
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,903
Hello.

419
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,448
Who are you?

420
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,409
According to that man over there,

421
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:27,041
I received Min-jun's heart.

422
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:48,729
Would you... like to hear...

423
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,275
his heartbeat?

424
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:48,039
Min-jun is here.

425
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,585
He is with me.

426
00:36:56,964 --> 00:37:02,011
I will live a good life... with him.

427
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,096
For a long time...

428
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:07,975
I will live with my best effort.

429
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:45,304
Have you eaten?

430
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:57,525
My son liked this.

431
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,820
I like it, too.

432
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:11,122
Will he continue to like it?

433
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,962
He might not like it when he is 15.

434
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,007
At 20,

435
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,051
he may not like it.

436
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,220
At 30,

437
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,266
he may not like it.

438
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:36,981
But I wouldn't know.

439
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,278
I will never know.

440
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,831
Whenever I see this, I will think of him.

441
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,046
That hurts,

442
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:05,676
but still, it makes me happy.

443
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:14,310
There is no way to comfort a mom
who's lost a young child.

444
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,229
But I can do...

445
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,990
It tastes good,

446
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,118
at least now.

447
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,210
...at least this much.

448
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,180
See you later.

449
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,808
It's time to come back from the spell.

450
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,018
I've been watching you.

451
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,198
Because of this strange girlfriend,

452
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,577
you had to go through all the trouble.
Sorry.

453
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:58,539
Why did you do something so nice?
To give me more work to do?

454
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:02,293
I can't help my charm. Just accept it.

455
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,006
I took too much of your work time.

456
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:10,885
I want to quit working
and just follow you everywhere.

457
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,179
You won't do that!

458
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:16,515
But it's sweet to my ears.

459
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:47,671
Delivery for you.

460
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,431
Are you Kang Sa-ra?

461
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,310
Mr. Kang Dae-sik sent you flowers.

462
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,733
Sign here, please.

463
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:16,951
Thank you. Bye!

464
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,937
Happy Birthday, my girl.

465
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:49,108
Marigolds grow well anywhere.

466
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,735
They just need sun and wind.

467
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:56,949
Marigolds always remind me of you.

468
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,285
Thank you for growing so well.

469
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:06,542
P.S. Marigolds have the meaning
of happiness that comes no matter what.

470
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,420
Happiness will come to you.

471
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:11,338
From Dad.

472
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:14,592
Today was my birthday!

473
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,921
Do you really want to choose this path?

474
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,177
It won't be easy.

475
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:00,846
I know.

476
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:06,810
OK. Then, I will pray for you.

477
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,578
Merciful Father.

478
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:28,540
Please listen to my prayer, Lord.

479
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:34,004
Please take care of family
who will suffer from my decision.

480
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:37,174
Please heal my friend Se-gye.

481
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:41,845
Please let U-mi love a good person.

482
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,808
Please have the poor and lonely...

483
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,811
I usually don't reveal these things.

484
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:50,854
Why did I tell you?

485
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:52,856
Because I listen.

486
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:56,443
It's because no one listened
to you before.

487
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,532
Please have the poor and lonely woman

488
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,785
eat three meals a day.

489
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:11,625
In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

490
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:24,364
-Why did you come here without calling me?
-This is my house.

491
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,951
You came without calling me, too.

492
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,001
Oh. What is this?

493
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:39,296
I missed you.

494
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:42,674
A lot.

495
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,428
Really.

496
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,482
I met your boyfriend yesterday.

497
00:46:58,607 --> 00:46:59,733
I know.

498
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,612
I did not say ex-boyfriend.
You are not saying anything.

499
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:05,155
Are you back together?

500
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,700
No. I'm just used to hearing that.

501
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,619
He looks like a fine man.

502
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,038
He wants to see you again.

503
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,459
Han Se-gye, are you listening?

504
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,004
What?

505
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:23,841
Marry that man, Seo Do-jae.

506
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,927
-What?
-You hear me just fine.

507
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,054
Will you keep pretending
you can't hear me?

508
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,390
If you want to keep talking
about marriage, just go home.

509
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,063
Here.

510
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:44,319
You are getting older.
You should have kids soon.

511
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:45,320
I don't want a kid.

512
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,781
-Why not?
-I'm scared.

513
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,910
If I give birth to a sick child,

514
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:54,454
how will I take care of him?

515
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:58,000
Why are you so negative?

516
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:03,755
You need a place to return.
You need a family.

517
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:07,009
I don't know. I have you.

518
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:25,110
Mom, how would you feel
if I looked like a different person?

519
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:30,032
Why? Do people say you are ugly
or that you've changed?

520
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,159
No, not that.

521
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:35,621
Don't listen.

522
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:37,706
Be yourself.

523
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:42,336
If I understand you, and you understand
yourself, that is enough.

524
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:47,966
Try to love every moment of your life.

525
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:49,426
Like me.

526
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,639
I never thought you'd say
something like this.

527
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,767
Why don't you want to get married?

528
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,685
He seems fine to me.

529
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,357
Is he a womanizer?

530
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:06,193
I dumped him,
because he was bothering my work.

531
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,447
He always looks after me.

532
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:15,410
He is too nice. I feel sympathy.

533
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:17,955
He is too good.

534
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:20,791
I don't like it.

535
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:23,710
Daughter, you are in a relationship
with him, aren't you?

536
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:25,837
I said I'm not.

537
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:26,964
Does his family object?

538
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,298
I object. I do.

539
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,175
I'm an actress.

540
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,636
Don't you see I always care for myself?

541
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,263
There are already not enough roles
for actresses.

542
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:38,350
-Marriage will make it harder.
-You are also my daughter!

543
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:41,895
Why do you have to work so hard?

544
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:45,148
I'm afraid I'll disappear one day.

545
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,733
What do you mean?

546
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,987
I will die one day.

547
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:52,447
And when you watch my videos,

548
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:56,159
you'll remember how pretty and good I was.

549
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,286
What nonsense is this?

550
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:02,124
-Get married before you die.
-I don't want to!

551
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:12,551
I'm leaving. Eat the food
in the fridge before it goes bad.

552
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:13,593
OK.

553
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:17,014
Take the herbal medicine in the fridge.
It's good for you.

554
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:19,558
It makes me fat. Stop bringing those.

555
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:21,852
I made sure the medicine would not make
you gain weight.

556
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:24,479
Take it. I brought it for your health.

557
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:26,148
OK.

558
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:28,608
Stop drinking.

559
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,444
Be nice to U-mi and Eun-ho.

560
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,155
Wash dirty socks immediately.

561
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,157
Am I a kid?

562
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:38,035
If you are that worried, stay here longer.

563
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:40,829
No, I have to water the plants.

564
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:42,831
Are plants more important than me?

565
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:44,458
Of course.

566
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:48,587
They can't even move on their own.
They must be so thirsty.

567
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:52,466
OK, go then. Go now.
I have to go somewhere, too.

568
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:54,593
Where?

569
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:04,644
She's not here.

570
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:07,981
Is that a good thing?

571
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:09,775
It is.

572
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:13,570
Do you think I did the right thing?

573
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:17,574
I lied.

574
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:20,869
Well,

575
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,664
I don't know, but...

576
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,879
she can  live her life now,

577
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:33,381
probably.

578
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:44,059
Oh my, this is so great.

579
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:45,727
Me?

580
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:47,229
Yes.

581
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:51,942
Oh, I have to go now.

582
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:54,653
Already? We haven't seen each other
for a while.

583
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:57,447
What? We met yesterday too!

584
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:00,158
-You said you'd been watching me.
-Well... that is...

585
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,994
-I have to go.
-Where?

586
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:07,082
I have a very very important schedule.

587
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,094
Thank you!

588
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:29,604
Hi, sit.

589
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:31,398
Why are you here?

590
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:34,109
I asked her to come.

591
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:38,196
Your mom wished to have
a meal with Se-gye.

592
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:41,491
So I made a special request.

593
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,828
She is not your guest. She is my guest.

594
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,121
Come and sit.

595
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,792
How come none of you told me this?

596
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:52,794
Surprise!

597
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:55,338
Sorry for being a little late.
I had to work late.

598
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,423
Hello!

599
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,428
We have a guest.

600
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:05,974
Hello!

601
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,862
I'm gaining my appetite back,

602
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,156
seeing them sit together like that.

603
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:23,658
They look great together.

604
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:24,993
What do you think, Dad?

605
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:27,996
If my daughter thinks so!

606
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,751
Looking at your happy smile,

607
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:35,378
I feel so happy, too!

608
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:38,840
It was...

609
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,092
Sa-ra's birthday, a few days ago.

610
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,930
Oh my, is that right?
Why didn't you tell me?

611
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:49,142
Secretary Kim, where are you?

612
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:53,647
He should have told me
about family's birthdays.

613
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,816
I'm sorry as a mother. We didn't get
to celebrate your birthday.

614
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,235
Don't worry.

615
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:04,115
Seeing the whole family
like this is good enough.

616
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,330
Happy birthday!

617
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:19,464
Thank you.

618
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:23,468
I've never expected a gift.

619
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:24,636
It's not a big thing.

620
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,681
You already have everything you want.

621
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:44,948
HOW TO EXPRESS YOUR ANGER WHILE SMILING

622
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:54,833
I like this.

623
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,334
I thought you would.

624
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,045
If I knew,
I would have brought something for you.

625
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:03,425
Your being here is a great present for me.

626
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:09,389
Are you back together?
I heard you broke up.

627
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,059
No. The Chairman invited me.

628
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:16,438
Makes sense.

629
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:19,774
Given that you broke up on a large scale,

630
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:22,360
it would be too soon for you to meet.

631
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:29,326
CEO Kim said,

632
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:33,455
"How can I respect the owner family?"

633
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:36,791
I was mad at first.

634
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,085
But thinking about it,

635
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:41,421
he has a point.

636
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:45,842
It does not look good
to take things too lightly.

637
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:50,555
Thank you for worrying about things
that haven't happened yet.

638
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:51,598
You are welcome.

639
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:55,935
This tastes good.

640
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:05,403
I see a lot more men as maids these days.

641
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:10,075
I guess it's because housework is
hard labor, right?

642
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:31,513
Han Se-gye.

643
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:40,355
Unlike my expectations,
you play the game unfairly.

644
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,942
-Kang Sa-ra!
-It's OK.

645
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:49,489
I don't know why you expected otherwise.

646
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:52,784
But I do eye for an eye.

647
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,036
Are you trying to pick a fight?

648
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,541
-You have no fear.
-I'm not done.

649
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:04,295
Eun-ho is nice and naive.

650
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,714
Don't play with him.

651
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:10,427
You know, he will be a priest.

652
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:14,889
Let's go.

653
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,155
Don't play with him?

654
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,449
I will.

655
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,084
TO: SNAIL BRIDE

656
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:49,883
-Hello?
-Come right now.

657
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:54,095
-Excuse me?
-Come to where I am immediately.

658
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:56,222
Right now?

659
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:59,809
I'm working, so I can't at this moment.

660
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:01,519
Is that right?

661
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,106
OK.

662
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:16,284
Why didn't you tell me you'd be there?

663
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,411
Then it wouldn't be a surprise.

664
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,581
The essence of surprise is
to target unexpected areas.

665
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:26,211
Although I think
my appearance rather disturbed you.

666
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:29,464
Should we go back to having
a public relationship?

667
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:31,883
No way. My mom will make a huge deal.

668
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,803
She'd want to shop
for our wedding this month.

669
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:36,846
Go for it.

670
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,557
No. What about my movie?

671
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:42,477
Is your movie more important than me?

672
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,313
What about you?

673
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:47,148
Am I more important than the company?

674
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:49,526
Hmm, well...

675
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:51,611
See? You are not different.

676
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:53,655
Most of all,

677
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:57,075
repeating the same relationship is not OK.

678
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,369
People will laugh at you.

679
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:03,164
If I'm laughable, so are you.

680
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:09,087
-What are you doing today? Work?
-No.

681
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:11,798
I have a date planned.

682
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,147
Did you clean everything?

683
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,192
Welcome.

684
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:33,403
Welcome.

685
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:34,946
Are you Mr. Ryu Eun-ho?

686
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:38,616
I am.

687
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,286
President Kang wants to see you.
Shall we go?

688
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:44,414
As you see, I'm working.

689
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:47,166
Oh, the cafe is closed today.

690
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:53,256
-Excuse me?
-The President rented this whole cafe.

691
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,967
-Let's go.
-Wow.

692
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:06,394
Aren't you going to eat?

693
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:10,607
Did you eat in a bad atmosphere again,

694
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:12,650
because of men?

695
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:17,488
Today was because of family.

696
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:23,202
I thought we were meeting to celebrate
my birthday,

697
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,038
but we weren't.

698
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,084
It wasn't your birthday.

699
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:37,050
Your ID had a different date.

700
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:40,637
You remember that?

701
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,263
I'm smart.

702
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:48,102
My real birthday is different
from my official one,

703
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:49,937
so people usually don't remember.

704
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:55,693
Don't worry, though.
I don't think it's a big deal.

705
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:02,867
Excuse me.

706
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:10,291
Yes sir, do you need anything?

707
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:12,210
Can I pay in advance?

708
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:13,294
It's OK.

709
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:15,880
I will pay, as I brought you here.

710
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:25,682
I make more money that you think.

711
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:30,019
Happy belated birthday!
Enjoy your meal.

712
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:03,845
This is interesting.

713
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:06,222
I've never taken a photo with someone
when I was like this.

714
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:08,725
It doesn't move me much.

715
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:12,729
I thought I was the only one
who knows the secret.

716
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:15,690
But many others knew it, too.

717
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:16,983
I'm a little shocked.

718
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,776
You ask for too much.

719
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:21,612
If this is too much,
you'll be surprised in the future.

720
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:23,406
Fine.

721
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,242
-First, Eun-ho knows.
-I know.

722
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:27,410
U-mi also knows.

723
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:29,162
I kind of know that, too,

724
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,706
-Then--
-Then, It's me.

725
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:32,832
Then, Gging-ggang.

726
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:38,421
-Where are you going?
-To hang the picture.

727
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:41,507
Do you have any comfortable clothes?

728
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,844
Find something in the dressing room.

729
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:15,541
This is an advantage
of meeting a woman like you.

730
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:23,090
Do you like me my hair up, or down?

731
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:25,635
I like them both, equally.

732
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:29,263
-You mean it.
-I do.

733
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:33,684
The real you doesn't change
and stays the same, to me.

734
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:38,689
This is an advantage of meeting
a man like you.

735
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:43,402
I'll bring more of this.

736
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:46,989
Oh my goodness!

737
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,283
Oh my. Are you OK?

738
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,035
Are you alright?

739
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:54,747
I'm not OK.

740
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,333
Did you do this on purpose?

741
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,419
Me? On purpose?

742
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,547
Yes, so you could touch me.

743
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:07,009
-No!
-I think yes.

744
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:32,428
I made a decision that night
not to be my mom's punishment.

745
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:36,974
I would not tell my mom
about this horrible sickness.

746
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:38,851
Forever, if possible.

747
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:40,269
But...

748
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,855
I knew it.

749
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:44,357
Mom?

750
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:48,277
But what my mom discovered was

751
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:50,446
not my disease, but this?

752
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:15,846
In the beginning, we pretended to be
in the relationship.

753
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:18,975
Simply speaking, I love Han Se-gye.

754
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:20,685
Blow out the candles!

755
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:22,436
I like you.

756
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:24,605
Your voice is different.

757
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:26,190
Because I changed even now.

758
01:06:26,273 --> 01:06:28,693
It's OK. You didn't know.

759
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:30,987
So why didn't you tell me?

760
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:33,990
Why do you only care about me?

761
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:35,533
-Daughter!
-Yes?

762
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,493
You can do it.

763
01:06:41,622 --> 01:06:43,624
