EPISODE 14

2
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:49,424
Seo Do-jae,

3
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,303
listen carefully.

4
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,311
I'm the reason it happened to you.

5
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,230
What do you mean?

6
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,942
It happened because of me.

7
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,377
The first time I changed,

8
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,838
I got in an accident.

9
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:34,385
It was on a trip to Europe with U-mi.

10
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,350
It was ten years ago.

11
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:45,355
Now... I understand.

12
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,398
I remember now.

13
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,985
Oh, my gGod. What happened?

14
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,822
He's still breathing. Someone call
an ambulance. He got hit by a car.

15
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:54,906
Call 911.

16
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:06,042
I saw the face of the man
before I passed out.

17
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:11,381
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:13,967
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,012
It's my fault.

20
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,807
It's all my fault.

21
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,387
Han Se-gye!

22
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,141
Han Se-gye!

23
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:47,685
Han Se-gye!

24
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,648
Open the door. Open the door!

25
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,111
Han Se-gye!

26
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,531
Look at me and talk.

27
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:05,203
Whatever you have to say,
look at me and talk.

28
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:06,788
Don't avoid it.

29
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,209
Han Se-gye!

30
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,408
Did you get hurt?

31
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,750
The old lady you saved...

32
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,381
was me.

33
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,845
So... what do you mean?

34
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,347
Why is she you?

35
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,061
The person you saved,

36
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,398
the person who ruined you like this,

37
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,902
the person who gave you
ten years of pain...

38
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,239
was me.

39
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,787
I didn't know anything about it.

40
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,666
I laughed right beside you,
as if nothing had happened.

41
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,670
I was happy right beside you.

42
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:41,924
I'm sorry.

43
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,220
I'm sorry.

44
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,601
I told you I would make you happy.

45
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,606
I can't do that.

46
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,735
I don't deserve to do that.

47
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,658
I... I'm...

48
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,038
I'm OK with everything.

49
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,251
For our whole lives,

50
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,172
can we...

51
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,094
be OK?

52
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,391
Can we put this behind us?

53
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,727
Can we forget about this?

54
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,398
Can we do that?

55
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,195
Can you...

56
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,990
do that?

57
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,331
Even if you could,

58
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,918
I can't.

59
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,171
I can't dare to do that.

60
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,509
Then what do we do?
What do you want to do?

61
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,680
Seo Do-jae.

62
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,435
-Let's...
-Hold on.

63
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:18,855
Just a minute.

64
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,358
Just a minute.

65
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:28,948
I will come back.

66
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,617
I will come back later.

67
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,412
Let's talk then.

68
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,023
Don't cry too much.

69
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:05,902
Don't feel...

70
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,197
too bad.

71
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,163
There is a way to cure it.

72
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,540
Really?

73
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:30,129
That's good. That's really good news.

74
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:35,718
There is a doctor who's been
successfully researching this field.

75
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,721
He is interested in your case.

76
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,350
Let me see him. Where is he?

77
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,186
Wherever he is, I will go.

78
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:48,230
But the chances are slim.

79
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,443
The success rate is about... 5%.

80
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:56,572
5%?

81
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,200
I cannot guarantee
a complete cure, either.

82
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,161
It could even make it worse.

83
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,622
Getting worse?

84
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:05,873
After the surgery,

85
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,086
or even during the surgery, you may die.

86
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,840
Would you still like to do it?

87
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,387
No, you can't do that.

88
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,390
Survival comes first.

89
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,811
If you don't depend on such a hope,

90
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,105
there is no possibility.

91
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:30,940
This is incurable.

92
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,278
Thinking of it like that will make
life easier.

93
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,603
DR. OH

94
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,577
What brings you here so early?

95
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,583
Do you have any problem at work?

96
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,586
There's no problem.
You haven't had lunch yet, have you?

97
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,965
I was hoping to have lunch with you,
just the two of us.

98
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,470
I didn't know

99
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,640
you were going to talk
about your disease at that time.

100
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:53,022
I'm sorry I didn't tell you in advance.

101
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,192
Not at all. I'm sorry.

102
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:03,115
I thought hiding the disease was
the only way.

103
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,035
I thought hiding
your disease perfectly was...

104
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,163
the best way to protect you.

105
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,834
It seems I was the only one
who thought that.

106
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,670
-I was so silly.
-Don't say that.

107
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:21,634
You did your best to protect me.

108
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,724
You and Se-gye are doing well, right?

109
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:32,978
Ten years ago,

110
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,775
if I hadn't been in that accident,

111
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,403
what kind of person would  I have become?

112
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,075
Do-jae.

113
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,284
But...

114
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:54,208
I don't regret saving her life at all.

115
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,422
I regret...

116
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,844
telling you to help those in trouble.

117
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,847
I told you to set the example.
I shouldn't have raised you that way.

118
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,893
I've been regretting that.

119
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,323
Ju-hwan.

120
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,410
Yes. Do you need anything?

121
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:34,081
Do you remember when you first met me?

122
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,711
Why do you ask all of a sudden?

123
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,255
Because I'm not sure
I remember those times correctly.

124
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,471
Do you want an exaggerated version,

125
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,348
or a simpler version?

126
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,809
Just tell the truth.

127
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,062
You were beyond the words.

128
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:01,567
You were young, sick,

129
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:03,611
and sad.

130
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,406
You were very on edge.

131
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:11,243
When the training didn't go well,
you got mad and yelled.

132
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,622
Then one day, you refused to see anything.

133
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,416
You refused to tell any differences.

134
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,254
Yes, I was like that.

135
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:27,384
I was pretty moved
the first time you recognized me.

136
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,679
Then, I knew you were going to live.

137
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,265
I knew you were not going to die.

138
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,477
At that time...

139
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,105
did I suffer that bad?

140
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:44,068
If there was a suffering competition,
you wouldn't have lost.

141
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:49,114
It's admirable that you've lived like that
for ten years.

142
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:51,909
Ten years...

143
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,120
You're right.

144
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,331
It's been ten years.

145
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,041
You did a good job.

146
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,502
Isn't it nice to be alive?

147
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,712
You've even met a girl you love.

148
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,677
The name of the fish is Han Se-gye, right?

149
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,097
That's what love is.

150
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,724
In a world where everyone looks the same,

151
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,227
only that special person stands out.

152
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,331
Are you watching that again?

153
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,125
Goodness.

154
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,254
Did you watch all of these?

155
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,047
Yes.

156
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,508
How can you love yourself so much?

157
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:54,096
Are you happy to see the films
you starred in?

158
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,850
I'm tired of it. Really.

159
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,351
This is the last time.

160
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,103
Last time, my foot!

161
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,981
You've been saying that for years.

162
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,942
How can you watch your debut film
for ten years?

163
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,319
About your company...

164
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,114
would it struggle without me?

165
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,032
Why?

166
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,661
Are you getting married?

167
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,666
No, not at all.

168
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,377
Just curious.

169
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,671
That's a relief.

170
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,720
Why? Are you tired?

171
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:35,971
Do you want some time off?

172
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,766
Don't worry.

173
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,185
Take a break when you want.
I can afford that.

174
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,812
Just tell me when.

175
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,942
-Are there any commercials left?
-What?

176
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,486
Yes, there are. Why?

177
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,695
Let's do them all.

178
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,030
Suddenly?

179
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:57,034
-What's with you?
-Are there any other offers?

180
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:58,952
Let's do them, too.

181
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,954
I will do anything and everything.

182
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,916
You must be getting married.

183
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,126
You're becoming money-greedy.

184
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:12,299
Then, let's tackle
your boyfriend's company first.

185
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:17,763
I'm not going to cut loose,
even for your boyfriend.

186
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:21,642
We will do what's left and stop.

187
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,478
Then, I will ask for a contract renewal
and ask for more.

188
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,439
Why? Don't you like my idea?

189
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,568
No, we should.

190
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,697
I should do a better job
and finish on top.

191
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:39,284
I get it.
It's your boyfriend's company after all.

192
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,123
HAN SE-GYE

193
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,125
NEITHER SHE NOR HER SITUATION MAKES SENSE.

194
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,965
Although you understand the situation,

195
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,634
understanding a person is...

196
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,345
a different story.

197
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,896
EVEN THOUGH YOU UNDERSTAND THE PERSON,

198
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:13,986
UNDERSTANDING THE SITUATION IS
A DIFFERENT STORY.

199
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,114
It's urgent.

200
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,616
CEO Kim called
a Board of Directors meeting.

201
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,871
I knew he wouldn't just sit back.

202
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,414
What shall we do?

203
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,044
Let's go.
I needed a place to vent anyway.

204
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,350
-I knew it.
-Something was always off.

205
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,188
This is a big problem.

206
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,440
How can he not recognize faces?

207
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,109
I've never heard of it.

208
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:00,282
Alright, everyone.

209
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:05,245
I heard that prosopagnosia
or whatever is something serious, right?

210
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:09,833
We shouldn't let such a person be
the backbone of the company.

211
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,252
This is a considerable matter.

212
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,590
Can you imagine
what a difficult time he had?

213
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:22,346
Sick people need to rest, right?

214
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,225
You can say that again.

215
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,644
That's absolutely right.

216
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,995
What fun thing are you gathered here
to talk about?

217
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,543
Our Director is here.

218
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,714
Do you think we gathered here
to talk about something fun?

219
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,843
We were talking about something sad.
Very sad.

220
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,847
How can we better serve our Director

221
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,810
who is having a hard time working?

222
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,730
How can we all help you?

223
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,609
I was asking for opinions on that.

224
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,494
Director Seo,

225
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,206
It's me, CEO Kim.

226
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,417
Here, I'm here.

227
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,295
Are you recognizing me? 

228
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,805
I can't put up
with your ridiculous behavior anymore.

229
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:52,352
Are you talking to me?

230
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,562
CEO Kim.

231
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,231
Don't come to work any more.

232
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,649
What?

233
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:01,820
You are unlucky.

234
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,365
You act up whenever I'm in a bad mood.

235
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:14,791
You don't know anything
about how a company operates.

236
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,212
Can you fire a CEO just like that?

237
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,924
There is a procedure to take
for firing a CEO.

238
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,636
I will ignore the procedure and fire you.

239
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,307
I can find a reason.

240
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:34,686
I will find any bribes or shady deals
that you made.

241
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,730
Procedure is none of your business.

242
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,775
So get out of my face.

243
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,069
Director Seo!

244
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,155
If you had any ambition,
you would've chosen the right side.

245
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,699
I warned you several times.

246
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,035
Why do you keeping getting on my nerves?

247
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,703
Getting on your nerves?

248
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,084
Do you think the Chairman will just sit
quietly and watch this?

249
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:00,295
Yes, I think he will.

250
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,931
Chairman! Chairman!

251
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,434
Chairman! Chairman!

252
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,687
Look what's happening.

253
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:21,191
The company is a mess.

254
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,026
Who are you?

255
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:30,534
I don't want to be called Chairman

256
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,120
by non-employees.

257
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:35,539
Chairman!

258
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,416
I want to drink coffee.

259
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,627
Wrap up quickly and come in.

260
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:44,047
Chairman! Chairman!

261
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:46,383
Chairman!

262
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,772
Director Park, Director Choi!

263
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,652
Manager Sohn.

264
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,195
Stop!

265
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,823
Who are you?

266
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,366
Let's go.

267
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,411
Hey! Hey!

268
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:19,124
Hey, Director Choi! Director Park!

269
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,084
Director Park!

270
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,904
Your timing was perfect.

271
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,780
What brought you here?

272
00:24:54,826 --> 00:25:00,332
Do you think I'm oblivious to the company
and just sitting around?

273
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,043
I planted at least...

274
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:04,711
100 eyes here.

275
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,339
So, you're here to monitor.

276
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,385
How did you know it was me?

277
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,472
I didn't say it was me.

278
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,808
I can spot you even from far away.

279
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:23,605
Not many old men are
so charmingly dressed in this country.

280
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:30,612
Is the actress doing well?

281
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,033
I don't know.

282
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,621
No wonder you were dumped.

283
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,039
I know.

284
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:45,669
I'm done with coffee, so I'm off.

285
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:50,632
You are not saying
"You are incapable!" today.

286
00:25:56,304 --> 00:26:00,976
You are not incapable at all.

287
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,064
Maybe not...

288
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,068
You might be a little incapable.

289
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,962
Being a grandson sure has advantages.

290
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,964
I think I chose the right side.

291
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,302
But CEO Kim sure chose the wrong side.

292
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,721
So foolish.

293
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,475
He didn't finish his coffee.

294
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,728
I put all my effort into making it.

295
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:48,857
It was bad.

296
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:52,569
By the way,

297
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:56,072
your girlfriend's shooting today.
Aren't you going?

298
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,827
Can you look to the other side, please?

299
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,537
Nice!

300
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,751
-Se-gye, can you smile a little more?
-OK.

301
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,338
A little more, please.

302
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:15,592
One more time!

303
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:17,427
OK!

304
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,764
We will take a break!

305
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,015
Here it is.

306
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,769
Chae Yu-ri won't come?

307
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,315
How can a main character miss
the premier event?

308
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:36,529
So the rumor
about her delusion was true...

309
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,573
That's so sad.

310
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,911
We won't be late. OK.

311
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:50,877
Oh!

312
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:00,929
Seo Do-jae.

313
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,057
It's me, President You.

314
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:07,018
-Hello!
-Did you come here to see Se-gye?

315
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,896
I can't believe you two.

316
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:12,607
-Should I bring her?
-No. I'm just here...

317
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,529
to see her.

318
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,657
Is that right?

319
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:27,205
Has she been wearing that face
all day long?

320
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,920
She doesn't look too happy.

321
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,797
Is the shooting tiring her?

322
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,607
You don't look at your phone lately.

323
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,362
Not meeting Seo Do-jae today?

324
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,615
No.

325
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:06,161
He seems to make a clear difference
between personal and professional life.

326
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,204
Maybe it was because you were working.

327
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,582
He came by, but didn't say a word to you.

328
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:15,962
What do you mean?

329
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,466
Didn't he call you?

330
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,677
He came to the shooting place
to see you working.

331
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,224
-Let me out here.
-What?

332
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,226
-Here.
-OK.

333
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,185
Why did I come here?

334
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:57,522
Why?

335
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:21,880
Is there really a God?

336
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,507
There is for believers.

337
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,301
If there is a God,

338
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,972
may I hate him?

339
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:35,393
Oh.

340
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:42,400
I shouldn't have said that just now
in front of a person who loves God.

341
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:47,697
I think you have
a good reason to hate him.

342
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:58,166
I didn't really like him
when I saw how Se-gye suffered.

343
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:03,212
I wondered why he had to do this to her.

344
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:05,882
And...

345
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:11,304
looking at you makes me feel the same way.

346
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,100
Why does he have
to make you suffer so much?

347
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:18,853
I...

348
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,816
can't recognize even myself in the mirror.

349
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:29,489
Han Se-gye is like my mirror.

350
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,036
Why me? Why does it have to be me?

351
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,081
Why this disease?

352
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,250
What did I do wrong?

353
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,463
Everything she says is,

354
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,508
and was, 

355
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,886
what I have said.

356
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:57,266
God must have prepared that for you, too.

357
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:02,855
I resent him,

358
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,442
if that is what he prepared.

359
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,412
Resent him as much you want.

360
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,582
I will pray for forgiveness.

361
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:26,838
That's the return
for you buying the drink, brother.

362
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,426
Not just brother, big brother!

363
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:41,894
Big brother!

364
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,869
Don't cry.

365
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,622
Don't even cry.

366
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,544
You don't even deserve to cry.

367
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,966
You ruined his life.

368
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:16,471
Why do you get to cry?

369
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,018
Don't you cry...

370
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,858
for the rest of your life.

371
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,161
I drank with Seo Do-jae.

372
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,038
What?

373
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,625
He asked me to drink,
saying he doesn't have a friend.

374
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,045
Why? Didn't he tell you?

375
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,548
Don't meet with him.

376
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,259
Yeah, he has a bad drinking habit.

377
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,762
He gets clingy when he drinks.

378
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:01,140
No, not just for drinking.

379
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,477
Don't meet with him anymore.

380
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:09,398
Hey.

381
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:13,569
I knew something was wrong.
Did you break up with him?

382
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,822
They didn't.

383
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,907
He is in love with her.

384
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,452
He seems to love her so much
that it was painful for him.

385
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,709
Hey, I got to go.

386
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,003
Where all of a sudden?

387
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,296
Are you going to work, again?

388
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,674
Do you need money? Really?

389
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,968
I will give you money if you need it.

390
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:41,639
Really? Can you wire 100 million won
to my bank account?

391
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,224
I will.

392
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,564
What's up with her? I'm fine.

393
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:53,317
I really want to give it to you.
Let me know if you need it.

394
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,237
You're really strange.

395
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:58,197
Is it almost that day?

396
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:01,200
You get mood swings around that day.

397
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,202
No, there are still a lot of days left.

398
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,038
Anyway, she is acting strange.

399
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,500
Keep your eyes on her. I will leave now.

400
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,628
Pay for this. Come on!

401
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,632
What's the next schedule?

402
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:21,053
Aren't you pushing yourself too hard?

403
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,388
What's up with you?

404
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:23,890
Did you really break up?

405
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,851
Are you trying to get over your breakup
by working hard?

406
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:36,736
It looks like you don't want to talk,
so I will just let it go.

407
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:40,072
You only have one left. The movie premier.

408
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,699
Chae Yu-ri isn't coming.

409
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:45,161
So they need you
and are begging you to come.

410
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,956
I guess she got really scared.

411
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,501
So, I have some time off, right?

412
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,253
Why? You want to go somewhere?

413
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,797
Yes, to see my mom.

414
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:58,925
Shall I go with you?

415
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:03,012
No, I have something to say to her alone.

416
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,891
OK, go. Call me if you need me.

417
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,810
I'm always on standby, as you know.

418
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,371
MEDICINE

419
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:29,538
You're here.

420
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:34,168
-Sorry I made you come for such a thing.
-Let's go to the doctor's.

421
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:41,133
This is not serious enough
to go to the doctor's. I'm fine.

422
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,678
Let's go and see a doctor together.

423
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,349
If I see a doctor,
that would hurt the company.

424
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,980
Or more precisely, the company stocks.

425
00:37:56,899 --> 00:38:00,236
You have lots of money.
Call your personal doctor.

426
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,282
You watch too much TV.

427
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:08,411
It's not like I need surgery. I'm OK.

428
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,538
I just need to take medicine.

429
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,626
But...

430
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,964
I didn't know who else to call, 

431
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,383
so I called you.

432
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,607
Thank you. You may go now.

433
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,115
Did you eat?

434
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:51,495
The pharmacists said
you must take the medicine after a meal.

435
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:01,255
Are you really good at what you do?

436
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,759
Or are you really inflexible?

437
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,382
You're watching me eat.

438
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,426
Is it uncomfortable?

439
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:51,597
No.

440
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,559
I feel less lonely now.

441
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:04,276
I'm good at doing things alone.
It's my strength.

442
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,573
But when I'm sick, I feel pity for myself.

443
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:23,045
It just occurred to me...

444
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:27,967
that this woman...

445
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,470
cannot live without me.

446
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,145
The person I need to save...

447
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:42,231
is her.

448
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:02,209
You look nice with that smile.

449
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:09,884
Mom.

450
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,096
I guess I am in Seoul
because you are here.

451
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:17,600
I...

452
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:22,271
came here because I won't be able
to see you for a while.

453
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,902
You said I can do it.

454
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,782
But I couldn't.

455
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:43,334
I'm sorry, mom.

456
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,295
I'm sorry.

457
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:58,265
I was a bit surprised
to hear you wanted to see me.

458
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:00,976
Why?

459
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,730
Well... it's just that...

460
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,608
One moment.
I have something to give to you.

461
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,828
Isn't that strange?

462
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,957
I think of you wherever I go.

463
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,918
I think, "This will suit you"
and "this will look nice on you."

464
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:27,836
Well...

465
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:31,632
I can't take this.

466
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,967
Don't be burdened.

467
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,386
As you can see, It's not that expensive.

468
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:39,431
No. I really can't take this.

469
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,356
I'm giving this to you to thank you.

470
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:51,026
Despite Do-jae's disease,

471
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,863
you are beside him and love him.

472
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,407
I want to thank you for that.

473
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:09,003
Han Se-gye, why are you doing this?

474
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:14,425
I'm going to break up with Seo Do-jae.

475
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,969
I came here to say that.

476
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:18,887
W... why?

477
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:25,519
Is it because of his disease?

478
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,062
Yes.

479
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,190
It's because of his disease.

480
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:34,820
I can't be with him
because of the disease.

481
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:42,453
Please don't leave him.
You can't leave him.

482
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,497
He finally smiles and feels happy.

483
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:47,875
He needs to take care of himself.

484
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:49,960
Please...

485
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,007
I'm...

486
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:59,595
just his weakness, as you've said.

487
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,391
Please take good care of him,
so that he doesn't get hurt.

488
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,478
So that he doesn't get hurt too bad.

489
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:10,981
I'm sorry. 

490
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:13,442
I apologize.

491
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:16,320
I'm sorry.

492
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,161
Do-jae!

493
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,634
Sorry, Mother. I will explain later.

494
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:41,804
Please come out.

495
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,495
I wanted to apologize to her.

496
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,085
I can't explain everything,

497
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:17,464
but I wanted to apologize
by whatever means I could.

498
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,261
That you have to live like this,

499
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,014
and your mom has to live like this,

500
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,226
it's all my fault.

501
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:33,856
It's all because of me.

502
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:36,692
How dare I?

503
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,361
How dare I?

504
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,990
I ruined one person's life.

505
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,326
I ruined your entire life.

506
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,253
I told you I would come back.

507
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,298
I'm sorry I didn't show up.

508
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,260
In fact, I went.

509
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,638
I went to you.

510
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,017
I was afraid you might say that.

511
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:13,645
I was afraid you'd say things
that I've been avoiding.

512
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,732
So I couldn't get close to you.

513
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:22,738
I couldn't talk to you.

514
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:26,867
If I can,

515
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,205
I want to solve all these problems.

516
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:34,917
But I cannot go back to the past.

517
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:38,629
I cannot undo what's already happened.

518
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,549
I cannot make you forget everything.

519
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,552
I cannot forget everything, either.

520
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:49,723
There is nothing...

521
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:53,477
I can do.

522
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,607
There is one thing you can do.

523
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:15,374
Forget me.

524
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:21,380
Forget us.

525
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:25,717
Even if I'm beside you,

526
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:28,846
you won't be happy.

527
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:34,518
You won't be able to ignore
my extreme suffering.

528
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,937
And we will suffer together.

529
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:42,901
As long as we are together,

530
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:45,904
we can't be happy.

531
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:51,869
I ruined the past, the present,
and the future.

532
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,997
So please...

533
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:59,167
I beg you without shame.

534
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:05,924
Let's break up.

535
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:11,722
Leave me.

536
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:41,752
I can't remember...

537
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,923
your face...

538
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,176
smiling at me.

539
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:55,682
I want to remember.

540
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:02,272
But I can't.

541
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:21,583
Actor Go Ju-young
and actress Jung hye-young are here.

542
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:27,089
-Look here please.
-Please look here.

543
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:30,342
-Please look here.
-Thank you.

544
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,803
Next is actor Kim Jun-hyuk
and actress Han Hye-yun.

545
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,388
You two are together today.

546
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:35,722
Come to the center, please.

547
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:39,768
Thank you.

548
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:43,689
Actor Kim Do-young is here. Welcome.

549
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,107
Please look here.

550
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:47,526
-You are handsome.
-Over here.

551
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:50,612
-Look here.
-Over here. Thank you.

552
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:54,783
Thank you.

553
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:59,997
Lead actress Chae Yu-ri couldn't make it
due to her personal matter. We apologize.

554
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,291
Now Han Se-gye is coming in.

555
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:16,513
-Han Se-gye!
-Look here.

556
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,016
You are beautiful.

557
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,727
Take another pose.

558
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:25,981
Han Se-gye! Over here!

559
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:01,641
-Hi Han Se-gye.
-I'm excited about your new movie.

560
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:47,312
Your hand.

561
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:54,277
Hasn't it healed yet?

562
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:23,306
Han Se-gye!

563
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,609
Even if it wasn't you,
I would have saved her.

564
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:39,281
But she happened to be you.

565
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,284
Saving your life was...

566
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:46,413
the best thing I've ever done.

567
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,793
You said I get to have what I want,
after I resent something.

568
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:54,880
For me, you are what I want.

569
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:57,424
But you resent is me, too.

570
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:59,968
It's OK. I can--

571
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:01,178
Don't be OK.

572
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,307
Don't smile at me. Don't worry about me.

573
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,143
Why are you so nice?

574
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:10,145
-Why are you--
-I know.

575
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:12,564
If we stay together,

576
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,610
we will be happy sometimes,
and suffer often.

577
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:19,487
I will take care of it. 

578
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:22,282
I will resolve everything.

579
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,034
I promise.

580
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,411
It is our destiny.

581
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,706
A very bad destiny.

582
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:33,543
I resent it, too.

583
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,214
I resent it to death.

584
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,052
If you want to break up,

585
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,513
look me right in the eyes

586
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:51,603
and say you don't like me.

587
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:56,358
See?

588
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,027
You...

589
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,572
You love me.

590
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:20,590
I don't like you.

591
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:29,891
I don't like you, Seo Do-jae.

592
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,313
From the beginning.

593
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:38,984
From the moment I met you,

594
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,528
the second time we met,

595
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:45,824
and after that, and all along.

596
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,659
All I hear...

597
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,621
is that you love me.

598
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,779
I plan to retire.

599
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:28,408
What?

600
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:38,668
Just like that?

601
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,921
Is that why you wanted to do all the work?

602
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,256
So you can retire?

603
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:48,345
Why? What's the problem?

604
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:49,888
I'm the problem.

605
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:52,557
U-mi.

606
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,144
Do you remember when I first changed?

607
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:01,358
At that time,

608
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,445
I told you...

609
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:07,822
I had an accident.

610
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:12,577
The person...

611
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:17,457
who almost died because of me...

612
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:24,047
was Seo Do-jae.

613
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:27,509
What?

614
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:30,470
He...

615
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:35,266
became like this, trying to save me.

616
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:41,064
He got in an accident, trying to save me.

617
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,987
He has had to live like that
for ten years,

618
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:51,783
and for the rest of his life.

619
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:03,211
Han Se-gye!

620
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,381
Pull yourself together.

621
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:11,219
It wasn't your fault.
It was an accident.

622
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:14,431
Don't blame yourself. Don't.

623
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:17,725
So, U-mi...

624
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:22,897
I cannot smile in front of people anymore.

625
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:26,651
I really don't like myself smiling.

626
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:31,114
I'm disgusted at myself.

627
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:33,908
OK. Let's do what you want.

628
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:37,662
If that makes you happy, let's do that.

629
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:39,664
Retiring?

630
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:42,000
That's nothing.

631
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:45,753
You have to live. Put yourself first.

632
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,426
OK. Let's stop here.

633
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,553
I will help you all the way.

634
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:29,714
Seo Do-jae.

635
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:32,926
Is Han Se-gye in there?

636
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,720
I need to see her.

637
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:40,892
I'm sorry.

638
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:43,853
I can't let you meet her.

639
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:45,230
President You!

640
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:47,649
I heard.

641
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:52,028
It must be hard for you, too.

642
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:55,823
I know, but...

643
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:58,826
Se-gye also needs to live.

644
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:02,413
She will die in pain.

645
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,000
I'm so sorry.

646
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:54,632
Bye.

647
00:59:58,720 --> 00:59:59,762
Good bye.

648
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:32,754
-Hey, look.
-What?

649
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:34,714
-Han Se-gye is retiring.
-For real?

650
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,924
-Look!
-What's going on?

651
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:39,719
-Han Se-gye is retiring.
-Han Se-gye is retiring?

652
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:41,554
-I really like her.
-She's retiring.

653
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,641
-What's going on?
-Is she getting married to that rich guy?

654
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:47,518
-Maybe she's pregnant.
-Why is she retiring?

655
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:53,316
Big news! Big one!

656
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:57,028
Han Se-gye is retiring.

657
01:00:57,111 --> 01:00:58,571
-What?
-What?

658
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:01,741
What's going on?
She's on top of her career.

659
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:04,744
-Is she getting married?
-Suddenly? With whom?

660
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:05,953
Jeez!

661
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:08,539
There's a rumor
she's back with the Director.

662
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,208
It just wasn't official.

663
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:14,212
Whatever it is,
I hope it's not a big problem.

664
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:17,382
I know. It worries me in many ways.

665
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,384
He's already having a hard time.

666
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:24,013
DR. OH

667
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:27,975
After the surgery,
or even during the surgery,

668
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:29,686
you may die.

669
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:31,896
Would you still like to do it?

670
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,819
Director, did you see this
about Han Se-gye?

671
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:39,487
HAN SE-GYE ANNOUNCES HER RETIREMENT

672
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:53,960
AUNTIE

673
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:57,755
Where are you?

674
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:02,885
I'm sorry I can't keep the promise
of not running away.

675
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,804
I asked where you are now.

676
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:08,182
You won't find me.

677
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:11,644
I will not live as Han Se-gye anymore.

678
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:14,939
I will only live
as changing and disappearing faces.

679
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,818
This is how it was supposed to be.

680
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:20,903
This was the right thing.

681
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:22,780
I will go now.

682
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:25,283
I will go to you right now.

683
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:28,995
Just tell me where you are.

684
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:31,372
Do you remember the agreement?

685
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:33,708
The last clause.

686
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:39,756
When our business relationship ends,
this contract shall be destroyed.

687
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,632
Upon destruction of the contract,

688
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:45,762
every detail that was written
in the contract shall be forgotten.

689
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:49,807
So, forget.

690
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:53,060
That's what we agreed.

691
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:55,396
How can I?

692
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:57,565
How can I do that?

693
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:01,486
These are my last words to you
as Han Se-gye.

694
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:06,574
I love you

695
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:10,912
so much.

696
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:25,384
Director!

697
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:56,040
Han Se-gye!

698
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:00,795
Han Se-gye!

699
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:21,667
I plan to take my picture before I die
and hang it...

700
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:23,836
over there.

701
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:32,131
