EPISODE 3

2
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,302
You asked if I can believe it.

3
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,554
I am not confident if I cannot believe it.

4
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,432
But it does not make sense.

5
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:58,558
It does not make sense

6
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,810
and there's no reason.

7
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,604
But to me,

8
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:06,524
in my eyes, you have always been you.

9
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,536
You've done this before.

10
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,748
Just walk, and trust me.

11
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,287
No.

12
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,247
No.

13
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,331
They misunderstand.

14
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,332
Of course.

15
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,000
Think about it.

16
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:09,254
-How can a human face change--
-Is that what you were talking about?

17
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,256
Don't you surf the web?

18
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,801
Oh, that's right. Your phone is with me.

19
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,220
-That is a misunderstanding.
-We...

20
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,638
have been reported as a couple.

21
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,641
Crazy... Why would I do such a thing
with you?

22
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:24,811
That is not a nice thing to say
to someone who saved you twice.

23
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,481
That was not the most appropriate word
in this situation.

24
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,363
That's not mine.

25
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,490
-It's yours.
-I said it's not.

26
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,783
It better be yours.

27
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,126
Do you have somewhere to go?

28
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,753
Reporters must be waiting for you
in front of your house.

29
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,213
I do.

30
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,309
What is this situation?

31
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,604
Are you the one who picked up the phone?

32
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,480
The "washing up" person.

33
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,317
Ah, "Jerk Seo Do-jae"?

34
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,029
I will explain later.

35
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,118
Hey, we are...

36
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,880
Hello.

37
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,548
Nice to meet you.

38
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,348
We're eating right now.

39
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,369
So... what do you do for a living?

40
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,499
How did the reporters know it was me?

41
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,711
I run a small business.

42
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,926
Well, it must have been leaked
from your side,

43
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:20,927
I think.

44
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,971
Listen to yourself.

45
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:27,392
Did you hear how rudely he talked?

46
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,688
Take it easy.
I have to go to my part-time job.

47
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,024
Why are you making a fuss in my home?

48
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,318
-You think this is your home?
-I had nowhere to go.

49
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,028
Nowhere? There are hotels everywhere.

50
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,322
I cannot go to a hotel with him.
He is not you.

51
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,199
Why would I go to a hotel with you?

52
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,450
Why not?

53
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,620
Maybe it did not leak.
Maybe it was intentionally reported.

54
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,872
What the heck are you talking about?

55
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,625
What would I gain from news claiming
we are a couple?

56
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,710
Was there such news?

57
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,962
Just a little while ago.
Don't pay attention to it.

58
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,008
You know these are all rumors.

59
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,303
They got nonsense pictures
and wrote baloney.

60
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,887
It is obvious.

61
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:05,847
It was that day.

62
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,017
The day you changed.

63
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,358
Your food is delicious.

64
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:24,699
Come with me.

65
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,465
Keep the door open, OK?

66
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,675
Didn't you hear?

67
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,761
He said she changed.

68
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,471
They're having a lovers' quarrel.

69
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:49,057
How can they keep the door open
when they have a lovers' quarrel?

70
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,350
You two are perverts, too.

71
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,734
OK.

72
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,153
Let's say your nonsense is true.

73
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:05,573
-It is true.
-Ask around. Who is going to believe it?

74
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,242
Shall I?
Let's ask if people believe it or not.

75
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,621
How did you find me
in the middle of a crowd?

76
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,624
-Is that important right now?
-It's important.

77
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,085
You don't recognize faces.

78
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:18,878
Again?

79
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:21,756
Who is it?

80
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,884
Which one of these people is me?

81
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,138
If I say who I am,

82
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,933
can you believe it?

83
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,062
Do I have to answer?

84
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,898
You didn't answer me either.

85
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,368
You're not just not answering,
you're avoiding the answer.

86
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:01,879
Here.

87
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,390
I think I answered you.

88
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,225
I answered last time.

89
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,686
I answered in the elevator today.

90
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,187
Is that not enough?

91
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,814
When you first met me,

92
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,482
you didn't recognize me.

93
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,818
Do I have to recognize you?

94
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,528
Why?

95
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,988
Because you're a star?

96
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:30,199
Also, I think it is I who deserve
to ask you a question.

97
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,118
In the cafe,

98
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,578
on the street,

99
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,163
in your house,

100
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,332
was the person I saw you?

101
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,002
Why do you keep saying such nonsense?

102
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,181
Han Se-gye for today...

103
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,600
ends here.

104
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,020
I did not know what this meant.

105
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,023
But it explains everything.

106
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,869
-Why were you helping me?
-Because you are my business partner.

107
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:17,747
I...

108
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,918
thought you were...

109
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,254
in a similar situation to mine.

110
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,676
Every time, or even one of those times,
I hoped you helped me because you cared.

111
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,803
To be honest,

112
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,807
it was not because it was you.

113
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,311
Sometimes, I helped you without knowing
it was you.

114
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,105
The media will become quiet.

115
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,024
I will make them quiet.

116
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,485
Pick up the phone when I call.

117
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,478
GRANDFATHER

118
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:25,690
Hello, Grandfather.

119
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,401
-I was about...
-"Hello, Grandfather?"

120
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,278
Come here immediately!

121
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,706
Good job!

122
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,874
Great work!

123
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,253
You just don't want to be
the headquarters director any more.

124
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,088
Are you really sick?

125
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,674
The chairman lost some of his energy!

126
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,134
Stop joking around.

127
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,554
I asked Secretary Kim to come in later.

128
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,056
Why? So that you can amend your will?

129
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,435
That is my hobby these days.

130
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:08,024
I keep changing the names
between you and Sa-ra.

131
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,652
If you cannot even keep
a model under control,

132
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,821
you don't deserve to inherit my company.

133
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,205
Are you really dating that model?

134
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,459
That is not it.
I will take care of it shortly.

135
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,128
You are so incapable.

136
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,840
You cannot even date a model.

137
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,432
Father, feel better!

138
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,100
Did Mom come by?

139
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,644
Your mother is busy.

140
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,686
She's a bad daughter.

141
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,688
Don't talk about my daughter like that!

142
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,942
As you keep taking my name
off of the will,

143
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,944
my mom is not making her time to be here.

144
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,697
I am my mom's son.

145
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:57,698
Shut up!

146
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,868
Go! Go and work!

147
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,244
If you don't want to fail.

148
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,581
Even a tiny little flaw

149
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,168
will drag you down, before I do.

150
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,505
Alright. I'll go, then.

151
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,634
Oh.

152
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,180
While you are hospitalized,
get yourself checked from head to toe.

153
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,557
Bye.

154
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,867
Aren't you going to say hello
to your little sister?

155
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,497
I didn't see you.

156
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:47,998
I saw you look at me.

157
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,340
-I saw you have a girlfriend.
-I know. I was told I have one.

158
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,300
I already have so many.

159
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,345
I did not need the girlfriend
that you made up for me.

160
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,389
Whatever do you mean?

161
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,057
I am disappointed.

162
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,436
The fight between you and me was tiring,

163
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,354
but I've never thought it was dirty.

164
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,690
I was wrong.

165
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:14,692
Take it easy.

166
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,361
I am starting to feel annoyed.

167
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,116
Are you pretending to be generous?

168
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,410
Like you're giving me a chance?

169
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,750
I am forgiving you, this one time.

170
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:35,212
Only because the man
my mother loves is your father.

171
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,473
Reporter Park!

172
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,683
How can you say that?

173
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,852
What happened to our friendship?

174
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,354
We had so many bowls
of fish soup together.

175
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,025
They are nothing.

176
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,320
It is true. She does not lie to me.

177
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,197
Of course!

178
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,451
It's true! I am Han Se-gye,
and everything is true!

179
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,244
You crazy!

180
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,871
Really? You two are together?

181
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:13,876
Even if that is true, you should deny it.
Even if you are beaten to death!

182
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,961
Am I crazy enough to date such a bastard?

183
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,756
I was just playing.

184
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,676
Adding Seo Do-jae to my list
of scandals makes no difference to me.

185
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,844
But to him,

186
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,679
it is a different story.

187
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,348
It excites me.

188
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,100
She is out of her mind.

189
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,645
Who was playing?

190
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,855
You are the one who got played!

191
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,316
Oh, my! I am speechless.

192
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,027
Are you dumb or what?

193
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,696
Whatever... whatever.

194
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,448
If I get taken...

195
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:48,619
to a place like a science lab,
will you come and visit me?

196
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,206
What are you talking about?

197
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:55,209
-Did you get threatened a while ago?
-Threatened?

198
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:56,919
By who?

199
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,171
By Seo Do-jae?

200
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,007
That's it! You were threatened!

201
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:06,178
At our home with my family,
he said,

202
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,598
"It was that day. The day you changed."

203
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:14,103
I had to take indigestion medicine.

204
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,147
You idiot!

205
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,275
Why are you saying this now?

206
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,943
Not only will I visit you,

207
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,779
but also I will use an excavator
to destroy it and save you.

208
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,699
He is out of his mind, too.

209
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:27,908
Did he believe it?

210
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,035
He believes the nonsense?

211
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,329
I got caught again...

212
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:41,088
He came over to our house
and saw that my face had changed.

213
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,090
-What?
-What?

214
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,592
What am I going to do?

215
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,969
What will I do?

216
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,305
He even had my phone!

217
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,849
And it had the videos of my face
going like...

218
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,309
He saw the...

219
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,187
I am so doomed.

220
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:08,699
Reporter Park.

221
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:10,367
It turns out

222
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,703
the woman was Se-gye.

223
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,749
Of course, I am telling you
so that you can write about it.

224
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,335
Yes.

225
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,588
Write all you want.

226
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,590
Yes, I'm counting on you.

227
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,216
OK.

228
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,471
Why are you doing this, too?

229
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,181
The best defense is to attack.

230
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,267
We have to have a negotiation card, too.

231
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,479
In case he is not cooperative,

232
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,232
we won't be, either.

233
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,611
If he says a word,

234
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:49,114
I will say he went crazy
after being dumped.

235
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,950
That sounds more convincing.

236
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,284
Work...

237
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,870
Are you not going to work?

238
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,873
Being a Chaebol's girlfriend is not bad.

239
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,376
-He is not just a little chaebol.
-You bet.

240
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,045
I will be highly sought.
Everyone will be curious.

241
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,427
You guys are potent.

242
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,566
HAN SE-GYE ADMITS THE RELATION

243
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,738
You brought this on!

244
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,119
Our position is not the same
as Han Se-gye's.

245
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,705
No, they did not break up...

246
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,585
There must have been a misunderstanding
on Han Se-gye's part.

247
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:44,795
Yes.

248
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,339
I will call you back.

249
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,509
You're here?

250
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,845
You must not have slept last night
because of me.

251
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:56,098
-I want to get paid overtime.
-You are not working extra

252
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,350
to get my position, are you?

253
00:16:58,976 --> 00:16:59,935
No way.

254
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:04,106
My goal is not to become a CEO,
but to become the highest-paid employee.

255
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,941
I am an ambitious man.

256
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,486
I am surprised you came to work.

257
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,906
It sounds like you did not want me
to come to work.

258
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,325
It looks like you are having a great time.

259
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,494
Did you two solve the problem?

260
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,537
Roughly.

261
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,790
How many days have you been dating?

262
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,083
Stop.

263
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,672
Ms. Vice Chairwoman left a message.

264
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,215
What did she say?

265
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:33,010
"If you don't remove her immediately,

266
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,888
I will," she said.

267
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,062
REPORTER PARK

268
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,442
This is Seo Do-jae.

269
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:49,902
Let's meet at 1 p.m.,

270
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,404
Reporter Park.

271
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,035
There you go!

272
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:01,413
Where did you get this sesame oil?
It is so nutty.

273
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,998
Where do you think I got it?

274
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,500
It is from a grocery store.

275
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,043
Really?

276
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,878
Why does it taste so nutty?

277
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:12,091
Maybe because I am imagining he is running
all over the place to calm the media.

278
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,635
Let me see...

279
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,805
I will get double points...

280
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,765
Good, it did not work.

281
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,266
I have another plan.

282
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:26,313
Are you playing the game with your mouth?
You are bluffing too much.

283
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:29,900
You can't have... It can't be...

284
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,861
Oh, yes!

285
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,073
You have to pay double.
Come on!

286
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,160
You are putting me in trouble.

287
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,996
Oh, Ah-ram!

288
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,874
-Long time no see.
-It has been a while, sis.

289
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,919
How do you always sleep over somewhere?

290
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:53,632
How can you say that?
I stayed up all night, drinking!

291
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,843
Good job!

292
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,679
-Excellent!
-She needs to be punished.

293
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,264
She is doing a great job.

294
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,307
She can't do that when she gets old.

295
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,601
Play now. Play all you want.

296
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,688
-What?
-You are so good

297
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,691
that I will give you a little allowance.

298
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,360
Stop, that is mine.

299
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,405
It is not much,
but spend it for your booze.

300
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,449
Thank you so much, sis.

301
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,371
Jeez, you two are just the same.
Hey! Aren't you going home?

302
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,582
May I stay here for a few days?

303
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,585
Reporters are everywhere around her house.

304
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,380
Nice pair!

305
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:36,133
-You said you hadn't played much.
-It is beginner's luck!

306
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,467
-Eun-ho!
-Eun-ho!

307
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,806
I can't believe this.

308
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,785
It's fine. Don't come out.

309
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:18,926
As you can see,

310
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:23,180
I look like this as I have not been home.
Where do you want to go with me?

311
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,979
You look just right.

312
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,607
You look natural and real.

313
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,567
I will not say it again. I am not going.

314
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,527
You will regret not going.

315
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:44,368
Did you forget that you are indebted?
You still have to pay the other half.

316
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,038
Don't you know
that the situation has changed?

317
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:51,541
You should butter me up
if you want to take care of the rumor.

318
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,418
I will keep denying it.

319
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,046
Then, you will be the one
who is out of her mind.

320
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,090
Sure, I am already known for insanity.

321
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,092
Everyone says I am crazy,

322
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,969
which means I have nothing to lose.

323
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:03,887
However,

324
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,432
-it is different for you.
-No.

325
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,017
I have nothing to lose, either.

326
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,354
The loss is for T-Road of Sunho Group.

327
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,149
It is the same thing.
You are just playing with words.

328
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,738
If you are considered crazy,
T-Road will be negatively affected.

329
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,033
Then, Sunho Group will be damaged.

330
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:26,994
After that,

331
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,705
the shareholders of T-Road and Sunho Group

332
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,623
will be victimized.

333
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,460
Some invested all they have,
parents' retirement fund

334
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,587
and their first savings.

335
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:41,967
You are shaking their lives up
just to damage me.

336
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,927
Do you understand?

337
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,263
What I'm worried about is not myself.

338
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:47,973
Not you, either.

339
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,228
Do you still not want to go?

340
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,154
How can I not go if you hold
all those people hostage?

341
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,448
I'll go.

342
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,742
On one condition.

343
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,536
If I go, there is no more debt.

344
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,375
Thank you for your active support.

345
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:19,212
Whether I will support or not remains
to be seen.

346
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,591
SHARING RICE FOR LOVE

347
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,092
Stand a little closer together.

348
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,095
-Please look here.
-Look here, too.

349
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,305
Here!

350
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,932
What?

351
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,853
-What is her plan?
-She wants to find out his weakness.

352
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,273
-Again.
-Do you know something about this?

353
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,860
Of course.

354
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,989
The future of the company depends
on today.

355
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:49,576
Check everything with eyes
in the back of your head.

356
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,371
That is why I brought you here.

357
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,623
Please smile bigger. Good!

358
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,546
You are good at making public appearances.

359
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,549
It must be difficult with the disorder.

360
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,052
Are you talking about me?

361
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:08,804
Or you?

362
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,056
So the rumor is not true?

363
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:14,142
-How did the rumor come out?
-There must be a reason.

364
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,685
Tell us the truth.

365
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:23,151
We had a briefly scheduled meeting.

366
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:27,697
But if you did not know that,
it is reasonable to misunderstand.

367
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,450
It was just a fun happening.

368
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,036
We also made an incorrect statement.

369
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,790
I don't know who made
that public statement.

370
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,375
For all the confusion,

371
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,293
I apologize.

372
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,300
Isn't she Kang Sa-ra?

373
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:50,470
-Correct.
-It is her.

374
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,350
Han Se-gye,

375
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,019
please take good care of my brother.

376
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,229
Huh?

377
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,439
Kang Sa-ra,

378
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:02,566
what are you...

379
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:06,111
My only brother has a girlfriend now.

380
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,948
And they want to do something
good together.

381
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,284
So how can I not come here?

382
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,260
I see.

383
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,390
I guess you are not close to your sister?

384
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:38,768
I mean...

385
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:43,273
you just came here without checking
if the news delivered a true story.

386
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:45,650
It is funny.

387
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:50,405
Did I misunderstand?

388
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,658
It is not a misunderstanding.
You made a mistake.

389
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,578
I apologize on her behalf.

390
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:58,538
No need.

391
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,123
This is just funny.

392
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,377
Since you brought me flowers,
I'll just receive them.

393
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,849
SPONSORING 100,000 FEMININE NAPKINS

394
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,643
-One hundred thousand?
-Do they fit there?

395
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,023
I could not come empty-handed.

396
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:28,610
Oneair decided to donate
100,000 feminine products

397
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,612
to help out underprivileged women.

398
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:34,241
To be in line with T-Road and Han Se-gye,

399
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:38,787
we pledge to expand our support
for the underprivileged.

400
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,048
DONATING 1,000 TABLET PCS

401
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,716
Oh, wow.

402
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,931
It came a bit late.

403
00:25:58,682 --> 00:25:59,724
In the information age,

404
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,519
everyone should be given
an equal opportunity for education.

405
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,938
In addition to the rice here,

406
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:08,942
T-Road donates 1,000 Tablet PCs
for underprivileged children.

407
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,658
Because of human rights protections,

408
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,286
you cannot take pictures of the activities
inside.

409
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,954
Thank you for understanding.

410
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:24,916
The press report will be ready to deliver
within a few days. Thank you.

411
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,961
-Why can't we take pictures?
-When will the press release to be ready?

412
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,146
Eat all you want.

413
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:48,273
Have a good meal.

414
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,525
Enjoy your meal.

415
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,818
Eat all you want.

416
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:53,528
Enjoy.

417
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:56,656
Eat all you want.

418
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:58,658
Enjoy.

419
00:26:58,742 --> 00:26:59,701
Give me more rice.

420
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:00,744
More?

421
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:03,997
Eat all you want.

422
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,749
-Eat all you want.
-Thank you.

423
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:08,752
Enjoy.

424
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,589
I guess you are not close to your sister.

425
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,925
She is more like an enemy than a sister.

426
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,762
Is it like sibling war?

427
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:23,892
To be precise,
it is a conspiracy of my sister.

428
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,186
I can hear everything you say.

429
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,604
Really? That is good.

430
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,608
How much do you recognize?
Do you recognize your family?

431
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,825
I am just asking as your family
are such snobs.

432
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,118
Enjoy.

433
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,748
How does it feel to change?

434
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,464
I am just asking

435
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,926
as you will need to change dramatically
while acting.

436
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,142
-Enjoy your meal.
-Eat all you want.

437
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,060
Enjoy.

438
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:09,437
Grandmother.

439
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,315
You just got some rice.

440
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,775
I just gave you a lot.

441
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,527
I didn't eat yet.

442
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,863
I'm not the same old lady.

443
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,783
Hey. You were just here.

444
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,785
You'll get sick if you eat too much.

445
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:24,869
Give it to her.

446
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:26,996
Huh? But...

447
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,207
She's not the one you just served.
Give it to her.

448
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:35,046
Ho-soon, come here. Sit here. Come here.

449
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,551
-Oh, my!
-She's my twin sister.

450
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:44,264
Oh, I'm sorry! You look just alike!

451
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,101
Eat all you want.

452
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,314
Eat all you want.

453
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:12,208
I am sorry for before.
I did not know what was happening.

454
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,502
It seems you still don't know very well.

455
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:15,628
Don't you see?

456
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,425
I am just checking.

457
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,719
Do you want to be part of our family?

458
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:26,639
Please get out of the way
if you are just going to talk gibberish.

459
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:27,724
I think...

460
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,268
I did an unnecessary thing.

461
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,146
If I am right,

462
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,356
we are on the same side.

463
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,525
I don't know how you are involved,

464
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,903
but you don't like my brother, correct?

465
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,697
He is a jerk.

466
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,369
You're right, he is a jerk.

467
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,498
-I knew it.
-And so are you.

468
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,796
Did you think I didn't know?
You were trying to screw both of us.

469
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,007
You are very cute.

470
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:02,926
You say whatever you want.

471
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,887
I guess that is why people like you.

472
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,391
Sibling war,

473
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,519
or conspiracy from the sister,

474
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,021
should not involve me.

475
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:17,565
I'm tired of that genre.

476
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,611
It is so old...

477
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:49,347
Good luck.

478
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:56,312
Han Se-gye is a very fun girl, huh?

479
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,236
Aren't you curious why I am here?

480
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,239
Media play is what you are good at.
What is there to ask?

481
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,992
So you want to cover your scandal
this way, huh?

482
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,369
That is so expected.

483
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:15,790
I guess I just showed up at the table
you prepared.

484
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,667
It was all for a good cause, so...

485
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,295
good job.

486
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,594
Speaking of Han Se-gye,

487
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,388
there is something between
you two, isn't there?

488
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,852
You guys look equally confident,

489
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:38,438
which means both of you have keys
to this situation.

490
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,482
Go if you're not going to work.

491
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,235
Why do you say that to someone
who's trying to help you?

492
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,281
Do you want me to help solve the problem
between you and her?

493
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,825
If you want to help, wash the dishes.

494
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,124
Oops.

495
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,584
My hands are slippery.

496
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,007
Clean up and apologize.

497
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,176
If you keep doing it,
I will break everything here.

498
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,385
Go ahead.

499
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,179
What's that reaction?

500
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:12,889
It is so boring.

501
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,682
What is there to react to?

502
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,100
I did not do it.

503
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,644
You did this.

504
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,228
You take care of it.

505
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,688
You...

506
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,108
need to learn that.

507
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:31,366
So annoying.

508
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,128
So annoying!

509
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,690
One more time!

510
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,942
Stand under the sun.

511
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:10,238
That is it! Good!

512
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,827
Oh, how pretty!

513
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:17,996
Once more.

514
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,976
He is so refreshing.

515
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,354
Why did I not make him an entertainer?

516
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,815
It is not too late.

517
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:48,109
He will go to the Cannes before I do.

518
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,243
Hold this.

519
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,924
Stop showing off your beauty
and help me out.

520
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,719
-I'm showing off?
-You are.

521
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:17,597
Why are you washing this with your feet
when there is a washing machine?

522
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,600
I am just trying to help.
What will you do?

523
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,143
I will take care of my business.

524
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,062
Do you see the woman over there?

525
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,608
Take her.

526
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:29,567
She's scary.

527
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,402
Don't worry. She's not as scary as me.

528
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,154
That sounds better.

529
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:38,618
Sorry.

530
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,412
Where did she go?

531
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,749
Go straight. Run.

532
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,024
What are you doing now?

533
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:14,320
This feels so familiar. So I was thinking,
where did I see that move?

534
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:18,783
My Gging-ggang does that when she tries
to recognize people.

535
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,917
You did it many times to me.

536
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,295
You were trying to check
if it was me, right?

537
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,383
How did you know that grandma was
not the same person?

538
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:37,301
So...

539
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,555
now, being able to tell the difference
between people is a problem.

540
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:43,766
Yes, it is a big problem.

541
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,978
They look similar,
but you see the differences.

542
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,188
Why is that?

543
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,942
Because you cannot just glance.

544
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,529
If you just glance, you can never tell
the difference, why?

545
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,783
Because you cannot recognize faces.

546
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,581
She does not know, does she?

547
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:17,967
Let's talk.

548
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:34,817
Help me, please.

549
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,486
I'm busy right now. Find someone else.

550
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:39,447
Help me.

551
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:44,911
Please.

552
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:05,473
Maybe you forgot.

553
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,476
I have the advantage in our relationship.

554
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:11,604
I know so many of your weaknesses.

555
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:13,898
Are you nervous?

556
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,152
You are doing this
because you are nervous.

557
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,070
Fine.

558
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:20,947
Let's say that is true.

559
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:24,325
Let's say I have that disorder.

560
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,327
What difference does it make?

561
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,412
That would make me feel better

562
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,040
because we would know
each other's weakness.

563
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,628
You really think so?

564
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,632
You are much more naive than I thought.

565
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:46,347
I can destroy you no matter
what you are and what you do.

566
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,183
The reason that I keep your secret is

567
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:53,437
my keeping silent indentures you.

568
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,939
Can you even imagine

569
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,609
how I will make you pay back
those debts?

570
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,823
You should know
there is something to fear.

571
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,658
That is what I am saying.

572
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:55,333
What kind of man is so weak?

573
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,085
I just pretended to be weak,
for no reason.

574
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,180
I feel afraid.

575
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:27,865
I feel...

576
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,826
very afraid.

577
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,414
I have lived that way everyday.

578
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,543
Not a single day has passed without fear
ever since I began changing.

579
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,671
So I hid from fear.

580
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:46,008
But you found me.

581
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,052
You recognized me.

582
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,306
Why did you say you'd believe it?

583
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,143
Why did you tell me to believe it?

584
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,105
That is what I am angry about.

585
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,233
I am angry at me being discovered
by someone like you.

586
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,070
I regret expecting more from you.

587
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,411
OK. I deluded myself.

588
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,622
You said you saved me
without knowing it was me. No.

589
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:21,043
That was not right. You...

590
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,422
saved me knowing it was me.

591
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,090
That is...

592
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,552
what you want to believe.

593
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,931
You just lost your chance.

594
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,319
Your chance to be honest with someone.

595
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,696
As I know well,

596
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:52,032
that chance does not come
as often as you think.

597
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,414
Mom! Mom!

598
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:01,375
Mom!

599
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,211
Mom! Mommy!

600
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:04,271
Mom!

601
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,857
What are you doing, in front of your kid?

602
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,235
Mom! Mom!

603
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:12,446
Without me, or him,
we all would have been killed.

604
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,702
Please get up, Seo Do-jae.

605
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:22,915
Seo Do-jae!

606
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,796
Oh, my god.

607
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,136
Call an ambulance.

608
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:45,896
Seo Do-jae, are you alright?

609
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:49,358
Seo Do-jae!

610
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,152
Seo Do-jae, Seo Do-jae!

611
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:02,538
Blood.

612
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,000
You are bleeding.

613
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:35,446
She lost her first kid there.

614
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:41,243
She sits there everyday and goes home
after dark...

615
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,085
looking like she barely is alive.

616
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,222
-How is Seo Do-jae?
-He left.

617
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,101
He did?

618
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,187
They wanted to thank you.

619
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,147
Did he say that?

620
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,857
No, Secretary Jeong did.

621
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,943
I did not see him after the accident.

622
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:24,745
Ju-hwan.

623
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:26,413
Yes.

624
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,000
Can you drop by the office?

625
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:30,918
Yes.

626
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,525
Sunho Group hotline is different.

627
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,819
The reactions are already good.

628
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,738
You even got offers for commercials.

629
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:04,118
Eun-ho will take care of Gging-ggang
for one more day.

630
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,416
Did you find his weakness?

631
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:15,671
No.

632
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:22,094
Are you sick? Do you want me to stay?

633
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:27,725
I am just tired. You go.
I will sleep.

634
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,187
OK. Rest well.

635
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,731
-Bye.
-OK.

636
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,247
Why did he suddenly act kind?

637
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,502
That makes me mad.

638
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,751
It's been a while.

639
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,714
And I am happy to see myselves here.

640
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:48,740
I emailed you the CCTV recording
of the date you mentioned.

641
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:19,062
Han Se-gye for today ends here.

642
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,440
Han Se-gye for today ends here.

643
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:24,902
-Han Se-gye for today ends here.
-Han Se-gye for today ends here.

644
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:27,154
Han Se-gye for today ends here.

645
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:30,073
Han Se-gye for today ends here.

646
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,950
Han Se-gye for today ends here.

647
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,536
Han Se-gye for today ends here.

648
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:42,628
Nothing made sense from the beginning,

649
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,547
neither the situation
Han Se-gye is in,

650
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,966
nor the person Han Se-gye.

651
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,802
Even if I understand the situation,

652
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:55,349
understanding the person is another story.

653
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:09,947
The take-off ceremony will be held
as planned.

654
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:12,908
-That's fortunate.
-I agree.

655
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:19,247
I was wondering why the Strategic Planning
Department sticks with

656
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,208
the model who keeps causing troubles.

657
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:25,003
Now I know behind the scenes.

658
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:26,797
I had no idea.

659
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,633
Why didn't you say anything?

660
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,136
APPROVAL FILE

661
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:39,601
Han Se-gye is the biggest scandal maker
in this country.

662
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:42,020
Her posting gets covered
with negative comments.

663
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,982
Other actors, actresses,
and films all get all attacked.

664
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:46,692
Exactly.

665
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:51,196
Nevertheless, the clothes she wears
sell out the same day.

666
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,533
The make-up she uses becomes top sellers.

667
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:57,285
And snack maker that make
the snacks that she eats

668
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,162
make new production lines.

669
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:03,875
It would be easier to count the big hits
without Han Se-gye than those with her.

670
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:08,255
Her masterpiece is herself.

671
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,551
You don't understand.

672
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:20,308
The ceremony will be attended
by the Chairman, Vice Chairwoman, CEOs,

673
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,728
and of course, the model Han Se-gye.

674
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:27,482
I am saying
that many people are watching you,

675
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:29,609
so that you don't make a mistake.

676
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,238
Thank you for your concern.

677
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:35,782
Having said that,

678
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:39,327
I would like to have my credit card back.

679
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,002
Didn't you say I should buy meals

680
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,212
and an airplane?

681
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,842
I never used it.

682
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:59,014
Then, I will see you at the ceremony,

683
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,016
Mr. Kim.

684
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,438
See you there.

685
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:17,074
Why do I have to deal with this
because of her?

686
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,256
Two iced americanos are ready.

687
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,175
Enjoy your drinks.

688
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:42,015
-May I take your order?
-One cafe latte, please.

689
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,142
Cafe latte? What size?

690
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,186
-Small.
-Small it is.

691
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,354
It is 4,000 won.

692
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:51,316
Hold on, please.

693
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:58,949
One hot vanilla latte to go please.

694
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:01,827
Oh, hi!

695
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,458
-Hello!
-Yes.

696
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:12,337
-Do you have a coupon?
-No.

697
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,595
I will get two for you as you work
for good purposes.

698
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,099
OK.

699
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,060
One latte and one vanilla latte.

700
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,609
Do you work around here?

701
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:36,361
No.

702
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,281
Come again!

703
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,753
Young kids are too aggressive these days.

704
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,639
That was cute.

705
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,018
Did you make sure each latte was given
to the right person?

706
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:10,312
Yes, I drew a heart on the vanilla latte.

707
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,105
May I take your order?

708
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:30,248
Enjoy never-changing beauty!

709
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:37,255
Never-changing beauty?

710
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,758
What is it now? You were just fine.

711
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:43,553
It is just funny, hilarious.

712
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:47,807
Sometimes,
it's so funny that I get scared.

713
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,937
I have such a thick skin.

714
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:56,107
Why am I doing this so hard?

715
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:59,444
Don't say you will retire again.

716
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:00,403
Retirement?

717
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,406
I would love to.

718
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:06,952
But I cannot make that decision.

719
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:11,706
That is why I keep wanting it.

720
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:16,670
Just like people saying they want to die,
but live.

721
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:22,801
Why can't I give up?

722
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:29,391
Why do I like what I do so much?

723
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:31,935
Why?

724
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,442
I have many thoughts and I am tired.

725
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,737
Just like when I suddenly age.

726
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:49,786
PROSOPAGNOSIA

727
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:54,374
Gging-ggang, it is me.

728
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:58,295
You recognize me
even when my face changes,

729
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:01,006
but not when I have a mask on?
You silly.

730
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:04,634
Quiet.

731
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:09,514
DEFINITION AND CAUSES

732
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,349
Prosopagnosia...

733
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:14,311
So it is called prosopagnosia.

734
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:19,774
Mainly it is caused by brain damage
such as a stroke or degenerative changes.

735
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:31,328
The patients have difficulty recognizing
familiar faces that they see everyday.

736
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:35,957
They usually cannot recognize
their spouses and kids.

737
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:42,672
Even recognizing their own faces
seems difficult for them.

738
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,889
These patients recognize people
using clothing, hair, walking style,

739
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:54,351
voice, and other cues instead of faces...

740
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:01,316
How inconvenient.

741
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,818
No, it's not inconvenient.

742
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:11,785
I feel bad for him.

743
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,122
Gging-ggang!

744
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:24,339
For them, understanding the plots of films
or TV shows is difficult...

745
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:35,308
Han Se-gye...

746
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:38,812
is she pretty?

747
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:41,189
Well... she is pretty.

748
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:44,567
But she is not my type.

749
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,948
What makes her not your type?

750
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:53,451
It is just that she looks like
a white vase from the Joseon Dynasty.

751
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:55,995
Anyhow, she is not my type.

752
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,206
Her face is too white.

753
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:00,708
Her lips are unnecessarily red.

754
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,043
What's your type?

755
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:04,671
It's a secret.

756
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:08,800
-What is it?
-If I say it, can you even tell?

757
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:14,472
You, you cannot look down on me like that
just because I do not recognize faces.

758
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,141
My feelings get hurt.

759
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:19,352
Don't try to buy my sympathy.
That does not work anymore.

760
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:41,875
It is just that she looks like
a white vase from the Joseon Dynasty.

761
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,584
Let's get used to it.

762
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:09,295
I have to see myself for a long time.

763
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,548
Let's get to know each other,

764
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:13,967
please.

765
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:33,152
Why do you try so hard today?

766
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,783
Because there is a person
who I do not want to beat.

767
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:43,454
NEW ROUTE TO KHABAROVSK

768
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,203
CEO Kim Hong-woo, Director Beak Sang-hyun.

769
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,581
Director Seo Mu-seok, and Vice Chairwoman.

770
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:29,375
Chaiman, and VIce President Kyla.

771
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:32,587
Next is the director
of Seoul Regional Office of Aviation.

772
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:34,714
He is the special VIP
you need to pay attention to.

773
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,633
He loves attention.

774
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:40,803
He can impact T-Road quickly,
on a large scale.

775
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:45,391
And this is Han Se-gye.

776
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,423
He escaped.

777
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:10,518
I arranged for him to meet
with a nice girl recently,

778
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:12,895
but I guess he did not like her.

779
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,982
I had a hard time apologizing
to her parents.

780
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:18,860
He is too picky, way too picky!

781
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,988
He grew up with you, so I understand.

782
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,073
-That's not it.
-Then, what is it?

783
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:28,077
You pretended to call your girlfriend
during the blind date?

784
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:31,038
Or, maybe...

785
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,707
Does he have someone, Ju-hwan?

786
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:35,710
As far as I know, he does not.

787
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:39,380
So pathetic.
You don't even have a girlfriend.

788
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,716
Are you sure?

789
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,512
You better not have one.

790
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:49,515
Please do not make
the media rumor turn out to be true.

791
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:53,644
Trust me. Please trust me
and do not bother Han Se-gye.

792
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:54,896
If so, it is fortunate.

793
01:02:56,647 --> 01:02:57,648
Let's go, Dad.

794
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:12,121
I have that. I will bring it to you.

795
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,456
Yes. Let's hurry.

796
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:18,085
Oh, I am sorry.

797
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:20,296
-I am so sorry.
-Are you OK?

798
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:22,673
-I am fine.
-I am sorry.

799
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:26,969
We will cut the ribbon now.

800
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:29,388
Please be seated.

801
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:33,017
I would like to invite the VIPs
to the stage here.

802
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:51,661
That day...

803
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:55,915
Congratulations!

804
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:58,709
Congratulations, Mr. Seo!

805
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:03,798
Please excuse my casual look.

806
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:07,468
Something spilled on me,
so I did not have a chance to greet you.

807
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:12,515
Ah, yes.

808
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:17,770
You don't recognize me?

809
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:24,652
Who is he?

810
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:26,654
What's the matter?

811
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:41,252
You really don't know me?

812
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:46,549
Hello!

813
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:49,886
It's a nice surprise to see you here!

814
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:51,804
It is so good to see you.

815
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:54,724
Do we know each other?

816
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:55,850
Excuse me?

817
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:58,144
Don't you know me?

818
01:04:58,227 --> 01:04:59,687
I sure do, Han Se-gye.

819
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:02,690
You do! When did you come?
Did you get to eat?

820
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:03,649
Excuse me?

821
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,403
What was your name again?

822
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:08,696
Kim?

823
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:10,281
Lee?

824
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:11,824
Park?

825
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:15,620
I am sorry.

826
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:18,831
I memorize movie lines really well,
but not names.

827
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:23,544
-I am Jang Kyung-goo.
-That's right! I remember now!

828
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:26,172
-We don't know each other!
-What?

829
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:28,549
But why did you look so familiar?

830
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:32,595
-Maybe I saw you in the economy magazine.
-Do you read economy magazine?

831
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:33,930
Nope.

832
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:48,986
To celebrate the new route of T-Road
and wish for the route's success,

833
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:51,405
we will cut the ribbon.

834
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:56,369
VIPs, please cut the ribbon
on the count of three.

835
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:03,417
Han Se-gye.

836
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:05,795
No need to thank me.

837
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:08,631
One.

838
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:11,592
It would not have mattered
if it was you or not.

839
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:13,177
Two.

840
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,388
I would have helped even if I did not know
it was you.

841
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:18,849
Three.

842
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:57,221
I feel afraid.

843
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:00,182
I feel very afraid.

844
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:02,184
So I hid from fear.

845
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:04,228
But you found me.

846
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:08,566
You recognized me.

847
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:13,904
Even so, you were still...

848
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:17,074
It would not have mattered
if it was you or not.

849
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,994
I would have helped even if I did not know
it was you.

850
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:23,873
You really aren't afraid.

851
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:40,848
You should have left it alone.

852
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:43,726
You should have let
that jerk get destroyed.

853
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:45,644
I was being nosy again.

854
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:47,563
No, you did the right thing.

855
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:51,108
If he has a good conscience,
he will not hurt someone who saved him.

856
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:00,409
Yes. Document?

857
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:02,036
What document?

858
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,332
They say I did not get
some kind of document.

859
01:08:06,665 --> 01:08:08,375
Just wait here until I go and get it.

860
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:10,878
-Come back quickly.
-OK.

861
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:13,839
What document did I not get?

862
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:20,012
You are right. I should have left it alone
so that he gets in trouble.

863
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:24,141
Why did I...

864
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,562
But I felt bad for him...

865
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:40,616
Seo Do-jae, what are you doing here?

866
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,284
You told me before.

867
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:44,870
I am the one who found you
hiding from fear.

868
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:49,917
I lost a chance to be honest.

869
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:52,002
So I am saying this.

870
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:54,755
I found you
and I want to know more about you.

871
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:57,466
I want to capture
the opportunity to be honest.

872
01:08:58,884 --> 01:09:00,553
What is this all of sudden?

873
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:01,512
Are you busy later?

874
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:05,307
No, not really.

875
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:06,225
Good.

876
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:10,729
Then, let's sleep together, later.

877
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:15,693
Excuse me?

878
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:18,070
Sleep with me.

879
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:57,735
Let's sign the contract.

880
01:09:57,818 --> 01:10:00,654
-I will not run away.
-I know that well, Han Se-gye.

881
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:04,742
-What does "sleeping together" mean?
-We just need to keep being together.

882
01:10:04,825 --> 01:10:05,868
Good. Just sleep with him.

883
01:10:05,951 --> 01:10:08,370
Why do you keep appearing?
Are you following me?

884
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:10,414
-Of course not.
-What about Eun-ho?

885
01:10:10,497 --> 01:10:12,041
Are you really following me?

886
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:13,876
Am I not better than her?

887
01:10:13,959 --> 01:10:15,336
You are better.

888
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:16,962
Say that one more time, please?

889
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:20,132
You are the only actress I can recognize.

890
01:10:24,845 --> 01:10:27,348
