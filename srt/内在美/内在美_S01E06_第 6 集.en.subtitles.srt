1
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,298
I appeared confidently

2
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:51,760
and I said I was her boyfriend.

3
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,597
But at the corner of my heart...

4
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,144
Hi, there.

5
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,150
Right?

6
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,403
How can you not come to my wedding?

7
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,614
I told his family so proudly
that you would come.

8
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,658
When you debuted,
I went to the theater three times.

9
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,744
Are you too famous to come
and see me now?

10
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,120
Is it Se-jin?

11
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,456
She is mad that I did not attend
her wedding.

12
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,459
She asked if you came until she walked in.

13
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,294
This happens all the time.

14
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,089
This is how my friendships get organized.

15
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,926
I might not even be able to go
to my own wedding, not to mention hers.

16
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,351
I am so disappointed in you.

17
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:48,733
I am sorry.

18
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,280
From the first day when I began changing,

19
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,534
I've always been falsely misunderstood.

20
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:03,248
How can you not come
when your mom had surgery?

21
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,166
I am sorry.

22
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,544
I had an important schedule that day.

23
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,628
Schedule?

24
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,465
If I die,
money and fame will not feel the same.

25
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,551
I said I am sorry.

26
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,221
-Do you need anything?
-No, I don't.

27
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:21,266
Since I did not have a chaperone, I had
to get an endoscopy without sedation.

28
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,268
Do you know how sad I was?

29
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,687
This is why people say kids are no use.

30
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,063
Bye.

31
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,904
I could not cry every time,

32
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,032
as ten years is a long time.

33
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,545
I am sorry, I am so sorry.

34
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,840
I didn't see anything.
I couldn't see anything.

35
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,844
Misunderstanding is my old friend.

36
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,263
To tell the truth, I was there.

37
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,932
I was there,

38
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,394
but she did not recognize me.

39
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,818
Let's take one more.

40
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:19,324
Mother,

41
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,953
to tell the truth, I went there.

42
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,833
I was there with my mom.

43
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,127
Isn't she killing?

44
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,378
She is pretty.

45
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:36,758
Why is such a pretty daughter not coming
to see you, when you are sick?

46
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,427
She is too busy to come.

47
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:43,598
She insisted on coming,
but I did not let her.

48
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,185
She is so famous,
so that is understandable.

49
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,230
By the way, who did you come to visit?

50
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:53,900
My mom.

51
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,446
Your mom?

52
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,698
Your family must live a long time.

53
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:28,768
Oh my goodness.

54
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,896
-What are you doing in here?
-Get out!

55
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,444
I thought I was getting used to this.

56
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,823
But this kind of incident happened
for the first time.

57
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,199
EPISODE 6

58
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,140
Please go to my house.

59
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,392
But this happened because of me.
I should...

60
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,227
Do you want me to get killed?

61
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,734
The passcode is my birthday.
You know it.

62
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,319
If you are who you are.

63
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:20,611
I know the passcode.

64
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,864
Because I am who I am.

65
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,200
You must be her.

66
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,051
It seems correct.

67
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,681
Please go home. I am not done checking.

68
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,813
You did not forget the clause
about not running way, correct?

69
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,940
You don't run away, either.

70
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,166
How old is he?

71
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,250
Not sure.

72
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,295
Eighteen or 19?

73
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,549
You don't even know the age
of a person you slept with?

74
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,468
We haven't known each other long.

75
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,472
You just met with such a young...

76
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:30,848
young...

77
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:37,480
Oh no. This is because
I was against her with no apparent reason.

78
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,524
It is all because of me.

79
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,528
This is my fault.
I am responsible for this.

80
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,114
I know what you are imagining.

81
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,992
But whatever you imagine,
it is not as bad as that.

82
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,581
What? You guys already went that far?

83
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,920
What is going on?

84
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,465
-Honey!
-Yes!

85
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,176
She was just a bit shocked.
There is no big problem.

86
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,763
I am not the one who got shocked. He is.

87
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,683
For your information, I am not prejudiced.

88
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,060
But it is not that.

89
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:19,355
What are you talking about?
I saw it with my own eyes.

90
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,940
See what? You didn't see anything.

91
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,234
What is this about?

92
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,903
It is that Do-jae is...

93
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,575
-ga...
-Ga?

94
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,246
-Ga...
-Do you want to eat crab?

95
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,957
You don't like shellfish.

96
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,210
Sickness can change food preferences.

97
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,380
-It is not I who changed preferences.
-No?

98
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,050
He is ga...

99
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,141
I will say it again. I am not.

100
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,479
I shouldn't have brought these flowers.

101
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,230
I should have brought crabs.

102
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,326
-Oh!
-Don't the flowers look sad?

103
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:17,163
This flower has meaning
of "love that can't come true."

104
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,875
Why would it not be possible?

105
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:25,296
Sad things are always pretty,
just like you.

106
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:30,259
Yes, I am sad.

107
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,390
Your screaming proves you are fine.

108
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,896
My daughter!

109
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,859
Just say it. I will do anything for you.

110
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:51,697
What do you want to eat?
What do you want to have?

111
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:57,370
Dad! There is something
that I want to have.

112
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,957
-What is it?
-Se-gye.

113
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,168
I want Se-gye, right now.

114
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:11,008
Look at my daughter!

115
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:15,721
Even in this small room,
she dreams about the world.

116
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,559
Even when she is sick,
she is like that!

117
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,310
SECRETARY JEONG

118
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,440
You need me at work right now,
as soon as possible?

119
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,317
I did not say anything yet.

120
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,028
Is it that urgent?

121
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:35,032
If you want to come, go ahead.
We have a problem anyway.

122
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,912
That works!
I have to go to the office now.

123
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,165
Do you even care about your mom?

124
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,126
You don't know this, Grandpa.

125
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:49,714
But staying here now would mean
not caring about her.

126
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,966
Take care. I will call.

127
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,095
Se-gye...

128
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,725
I am sorry, Se-gye.

129
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:15,781
Oh dear, thank you.
Thank you so much.

130
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:24,415
Thank you for-- Your face...

131
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,542
Do you have an agent?

132
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:33,382
-Someone is calling you.
-It is not important.

133
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,013
Are you interested in acting?

134
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,891
My mom said not to take a business card
from a stranger.

135
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,310
I am not a stranger.

136
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:49,106
Why does she keep calling? She is so dull!

137
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,402
You know Han Se-gye, right?

138
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:57,073
I am a representative at her agency,
World Entertainment.

139
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,619
I've been looking for a face like yours.

140
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,039
What kind of face is mine?

141
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,626
It is a Cannes' face.

142
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,169
I will send you to the Cannes.

143
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,632
I will call my mom and ask if I can go.

144
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,804
Why does she keep calling?

145
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,013
Pick it up.

146
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,266
Pick up, Mommy!

147
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:32,566
-Is that you, Se-gye?
-I am doomed. Now what?

148
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:38,155
Isn't it like destiny?

149
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,200
No matter how you look,

150
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:45,371
you are my artist forever!

151
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,711
Hey, hey! You are too young!

152
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,216
I just made someone get hospitalized.

153
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,301
I can't stay sober, so give it to me.

154
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:03,597
Who? Does that person know you are Se-gye?

155
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,474
How could she know?

156
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,059
No? It's fine then.

157
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,185
It is not fine!

158
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,146
Seo Do-jae's mom passed out
because of me!

159
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,232
She fainted? Why?

160
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,949
I slept in his house...

161
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,409
Did you...

162
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,619
You are really...

163
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:32,251
grown up now!

164
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,671
I am so touched that I feel like crying!

165
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,051
You slept with him wearing that?

166
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,137
Not that kind of sleeping!

167
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,139
-Wasn't he surprised?
-What?

168
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,601
Was he not surprised to see you?

169
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,020
Did he call you by your name?

170
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,981
You said before

171
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:00,237
you wanted someone to call you
by your name, besides us.

172
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,531
Is that person Seo Do-jae?

173
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,410
At least, he was not surprised.

174
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,333
Good.

175
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,127
Now you just need to hear "Se-gye!"

176
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,172
U-mi!

177
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,132
What happened?

178
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,300
I don't want to talk.

179
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,218
Then don't.

180
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,845
Aren't you giving up too easily?

181
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,223
-So what is it?
-I don't want to talk about it.

182
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,434
-Shall I say "I don't want to talk", too?
-What is it?

183
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,396
-What is it?
-OK, I will be nice to you.

184
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,565
Oneair launched a preemptive strike.

185
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,943
It will hold the event
one week earlier than it used to.

186
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,778
It does not sound like a strike.

187
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,112
It is.

188
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,908
It is having a "plane tickets
for one won" promotion for a limited time.

189
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,451
The response is very good.

190
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,162
What's our counter plan?

191
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,374
Not much.
None of the suggestions are that great.

192
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,501
The most popular alternative
among the CEOs is to give

193
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,253
luxury incentives
to first-class passengers.

194
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:02,049
It is already luxurious.
What else will they do? Build a palace?

195
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,510
Mr. Kim seems to like it.

196
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,762
Maybe because they use first-class.

197
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,765
Is that why they are gathered here?

198
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,561
I am really not in the mood for talking.

199
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,900
Which one do you think will win
between first class and economy class?

200
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,487
The one with more heads is likely to win.

201
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,823
I don't want to play a losing game.

202
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,950
If this fight will be 17 vs. 1...

203
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,955
I want to be in a group of 17.

204
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,169
You just don't get it.

205
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,048
The first class passengers are

206
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:48,053
loyal customers of T-Road, right?

207
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,974
So, as a token of our appreciation,

208
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:56,020
I suggest providing
more benefits to them.

209
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,565
What's wrong with this plan?

210
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:03,152
If we promote this on SNS,

211
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,988
will you passionately participate?

212
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:06,906
I...

213
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,205
I wouldn't. Do you know why?

214
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,958
Because I know
they will treat me well anyway.

215
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,837
It is just what is expected.

216
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,590
An expected incident is not an event.

217
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,383
It is just an ordinary thing.

218
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,887
Making ordinary moments special.

219
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:34,099
That is what travel is about
and what we need to do basically.

220
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,686
We will change the target
to economy class.

221
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,941
Upgrade the seats to the first class
for event participants.

222
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,361
Maybe that will be OK for the short
and medium term.

223
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:49,782
But do you know what the price
difference is for long distance flights?

224
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,951
First class is more
than ten times the price.

225
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,118
So what?

226
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,705
Big rewards bring more people.

227
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:00,417
So, it's like Cinderella.

228
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:06,715
It looks like you like Cinderella
too much.

229
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:17,393
That is a great idea. You are so amazing.

230
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,894
Me?

231
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,398
We should also invite the real Cinderella.

232
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,943
Are you saying you will invite
Han Se-gye, too?

233
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,532
So you will work with her and love her
at the same time?

234
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:35,953
Is that a problem? I can do both well.

235
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:41,291
If you are envious, try to do good job,
at work and at love.

236
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,671
Let's begin the event a week from now.

237
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:51,093
The real Cinderella I know will be
busy for a week.

238
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,388
This has a much better atmosphere
than last time.

239
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,932
A beauty makes food taste better.

240
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,309
You can say that again.

241
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:04,440
This is the first time I've been invited
to the gathering I always heard about.

242
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:10,112
Does that mean you recognize me
a little more as the head of a company?

243
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,490
You are the first woman we've invited
to the breakfast meeting.

244
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,993
Your event was really good this time.

245
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:20,873
We invited Seo Do-jae many times,
but he has never showed up.

246
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:25,461
Maybe it is because you are a soft woman.
I feel we can talk.

247
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,673
It is not because I am a woman.

248
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,676
I am  just more ambitious than my brother.

249
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,055
"Brother" has a nice sound.
You can call me brother, too.

250
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:39,516
If you have a problem with your business,
you can call this brother.

251
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,812
I saw a picture that shows you
in a uniform,

252
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,440
and you were killing it!

253
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,609
Next time, let's look at it together.

254
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,199
A woman should not pour
her own glass.

255
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,162
Let's toast.

256
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,331
OK, let's do it.

257
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,373
Ms. Kang?

258
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,838
I forgot that I had to approve
something urgent.

259
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,632
I have to go.

260
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,510
Why do you work so hard
when you are so pretty?

261
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,887
If a woman is pretty, that is all
she needs to do. Right?

262
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,765
Absolutely.

263
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,309
Let's have a meal together often.

264
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,816
Such a pretty woman.

265
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,600
Damn ignorant bastards!

266
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:02,743
How pathetic! I couldn't say a word.

267
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:11,627
Idiot! What did I expect?

268
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,841
I am so dumb.

269
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:33,857
So frustrating!

270
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,464
How much is it?

271
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,474
Did you cry?

272
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,518
Who cried?

273
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:14,856
A cup of coffee.

274
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,446
You asked how much.
I am asking you to buy me a cup of coffee.

275
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,033
I will pay for your carwash.

276
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:39,006
I should've asked for a steak,
if I knew you would bring me here.

277
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,427
You asked for coffee, but I am hungry.

278
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,725
I couldn't eat
because the atmosphere was so bad.

279
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,770
Why did you cry?

280
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,024
I didn't.

281
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,400
You did.

282
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,116
Because of a man.

283
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,244
Actually, because of men.

284
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:10,871
That's odd.

285
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,332
You seem like the type who makes men cry.

286
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,127
That is true in many ways, too.

287
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,927
Since we're meeting like this,

288
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,347
are you Han Se-gye's boyfriend?

289
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,266
I understand.

290
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:35,729
Your girl is getting pictures taken
on dates with her fake boyfriend.

291
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,105
It must be upsetting for you.

292
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,650
Do you like her that much,
to put up with all that?

293
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,652
We are just friends.

294
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,947
We saw everything as we grew up.

295
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:50,327
Nonsense. There are no friend relations
between men and women.

296
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,663
Just because you could not do it,
don't assume others will be the same.

297
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,086
That is right. I shouldn't.

298
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,633
Then, what's up with the two of them?
They are not really in a relationship.

299
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:08,512
If you have a questions about Han Se-gye,
you should ask her directly,

300
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,138
as I said before.

301
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:19,064
OK, I got it. Then I will ask about you.

302
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,736
Were you really interested in me?

303
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,697
Interest?

304
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,533
You asked me to buy you coffee.

305
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:37,707
I was told you came to the cafe,
so I wanted to know why you came.

306
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,002
Also, I wanted coffee.

307
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,674
Then, why did you appear,
get my number, and call me?

308
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,389
I think there has been a misunderstanding.

309
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,850
I don't like a bad person.

310
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,398
HAN SE-GYE
BRING GGING-GGANG.

311
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,442
Got to go.

312
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,200
Thank you for the coffee.

313
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:16,872
I don't like you either!

314
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,670
I don't like a nice person.

315
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,813
Drink up and drink up!

316
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,940
The drink is going in!

317
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,903
How long will you make me
do the shoulder dance--

318
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,154
Hey!

319
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,742
Do you think it is time
for the shoulder dance?

320
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:57,120
Kang Sa-ra asked him
if the relationship was real?

321
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,997
What she will do about our relationship?

322
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:03,793
Why have you met Kang Sara for no reason?

323
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,963
Be careful before I sell your information.

324
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,507
Jeez!

325
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,636
Where are you going to sleep tonight?

326
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,471
You cannot go home like that.

327
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,348
Of course not!

328
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,433
I will take her to my house.

329
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,852
Hey, I am a man now.

330
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,229
Hey.

331
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,067
What about going to a sauna together?

332
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,569
Crazy! Don't say that to your big brother.

333
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,364
Let's go to the sauna
and see which of us is the big brother!

334
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,870
Gging-ggang!

335
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,122
Do you want her to find out?

336
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,666
Money.

337
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,335
You want money for this?

338
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,963
Hey, you asked me to prevent the scandal.

339
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,631
Pay me now!

340
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,052
Here!

341
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:57,889
Come here, pretty!

342
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,524
Who is this?

343
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,485
Someone you don't have to know.

344
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,653
Don't even dream.

345
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,655
Why? Anyone can have a dream.

346
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,703
How old are you? Do you like older women?

347
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,204
Gging-ggang!

348
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,713
How have you been?

349
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:33,425
Oh, you like dogs! Don't you?

350
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,926
You like this type of man...

351
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,848
Let her dream.

352
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,183
This is a midnight dream
on a summer night.

353
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,311
It will be gone in a week.

354
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:49,524
She always goes for looks. I am worried.

355
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,153
I am the one who has to worry.

356
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,949
ID.

357
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:58,867
Well...

358
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,870
I was just born...

359
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,338
-Out!
-What about you guys?

360
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,548
Get out!

361
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,650
HAN SE-GYE?

362
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,428
Hello!

363
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,062
I told you to come here
and now you show up...

364
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,690
completely drunk!

365
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,947
Oh, now you are not asking who I am.

366
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:24,202
Is your mom OK? Seems like she is OK.

367
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,705
She called me more than 20 times.

368
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:30,041
-You didn't pick up, did you?
-Of course not.

369
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,712
She will be fine.
She has withstood worse than that.

370
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,089
Don't try to buy my sympathy again.

371
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,138
Are you an alcoholic? Did you eat?

372
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,515
Of course.

373
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:48,017
This is the week that I eat a lot,
so don't stop me.

374
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:51,438
No matter how much I eat,
I go back to where I was.

375
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,857
Isn't that surprising and mysterious?

376
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,567
I never said you could bring a dog.

377
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,402
It is a puppy, not a dog.

378
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,779
Now that you mention it,

379
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,324
will you let Gging-ggang and I sleep here?

380
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:04,951
Why should I?

381
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:07,871
Huh?

382
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:12,709
Should I go home looking like this,

383
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:16,296
and make a triangle of the century
instead of the couple of the century?

384
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,631
You would love that, wouldn't you?

385
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:20,842
If you wish.

386
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,970
Do I have to explain again
whose loss that is?

387
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,184
I feel drunk. It is hot.

388
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,021
What are you doing now?

389
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,857
We are both men. It is fine.

390
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,443
Oh!

391
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:44,324
I see black intention in your eyes!

392
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,203
What will I do with a drunk person?

393
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,830
Let's talk when you are sober.

394
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:54,209
Look at the black eyes
with bad intentions!

395
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,378
Is this your type?

396
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:03,676
Seo Do-jae?

397
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,598
Seo Do-jae, are you avoiding me?
Seo Do-jae?

398
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,644
Seo Do-jae?

399
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,230
Come out!

400
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:23,488
Come out and explain about your eyes!

401
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:25,281
What's up with your eyes?

402
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:31,454
Big brother! I mean, Honey!
I am not drunk!

403
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:59,941
Woof! Woof! I am a dog.

404
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,110
I am certain I am a dog.

405
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,989
Gging-ggang's food looked delicious!

406
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,409
Die. Just die.

407
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:15,248
Oh! He has a good body!

408
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,584
Yes, it is good.

409
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,768
Why did you get naked and shower?

410
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,313
Then, should I wear clothes in shower?

411
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,316
What's the matter? We are both men.

412
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,109
Well, that is...

413
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,069
You remember.

414
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,031
Wash up and change your clothes.

415
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:51,618
I cannot let you stay here
looking like that.

416
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,661
Bathroom is that way.

417
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,455
Dressing room that way.

418
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:05,590
Oh, he has a good body, too. Excellent.

419
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,435
That is not how you do it.

420
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,771
Oh my! Jeez!

421
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,273
That is why I came.

422
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,193
A liter of blood would mess up my house.

423
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,404
Why do you come to the bathroom
without warning like this?

424
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,114
What's the matter? We are both men.

425
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,825
I am sorry about what I said.

426
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,453
Why? What you said is correct.

427
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:41,501
I will teach you how to shave.

428
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,175
Following the direction of the hair,

429
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,972
shave from face to neck.

430
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,766
Around your lips.

431
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:05,400
Chin.

432
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,868
Toward your mustache.

433
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:16,828
Hold on...

434
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:19,414
Don't speak. You will get hurt.

435
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,076
When you are done,
touch it with your fingers

436
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,287
to make sure you didn't miss anything.

437
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:05,752
Feels right.

438
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:14,260
Wow! You are very good at shaving!

439
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:26,439
Now that I learned how,
I will do it for you next time.

440
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,626
Just find whatever fits you.

441
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,378
But I don't want to take your clothes...

442
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,089
What? Do you need me to dress you, too?

443
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,801
Did you get that young?
Just wear whatever and come out.

444
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:02,809
It is hard to choose from so many clothes.

445
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,852
This is too expensive!

446
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,314
This is too big.

447
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,861
This is too long.

448
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,115
SEO DO-JAE

449
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:48,146
Wake up! No black intentions.

450
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,876
This is the only thing that fits,

451
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,170
as I am a growing teenager.

452
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,590
You did your tie well.

453
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,676
Right? I thought so, too.

454
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,722
Why do you still have
such clean school uniform?

455
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,850
My dad made it. By hand.

456
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,852
I will wear something else.

457
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:29,353
Han Se-gye!

458
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,652
Walk toward me.

459
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,196
What?

460
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,199
Come toward me, now.

461
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,659
Where did we first meet?

462
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,661
On the rooftop at the hospital.

463
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,376
-What did I give to you there?
-Insults.

464
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:35,962
Handkerchief.

465
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,588
What did we first eat together?

466
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:38,631
Swearing.

467
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:41,926
Sushi.

468
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,935
That was good sushi,

469
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,938
although the companion was a jerk.

470
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:58,109
It is OK. I was not good either.

471
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,568
You were OK.

472
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:03,823
It's just that I did not know you
well enough then.

473
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,462
You really are Han Se-gye.

474
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,506
Now that you see it, what do you think?

475
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,468
-I am even more curious now.
-About what, for instance?

476
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:29,890
-When are you coming back?
-Why? Do you want me to come back soon?

477
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,476
Yes, as soon as possible.

478
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,399
Do I make you uncomfortable like this?

479
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:39,942
Very.

480
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,695
Because I am not Han Se-gye?

481
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,238
Because you are not.

482
00:38:56,250 --> 00:39:00,338
He is the same jerk. What did I expect?

483
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,257
Yes, I am weird.

484
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,510
It is natural to feel that way
when I look weird.

485
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,846
He is still a jerk anyway.

486
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,600
One more tteok-bokki, please.

487
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:13,768
OK.

488
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:16,896
Enjoy!

489
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:22,276
Really? Ju Ga-young revealed
her feelings for you?

490
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:26,906
Give it to me. Hurry up.

491
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:30,993
What did I tell you?

492
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,497
Such a poor girl will fall in love
even with a little bit of playing.

493
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,541
You must be happy to be loved
by a super poor girl.

494
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,711
Jeez! Would you like it, if you were me?

495
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:44,090
Why not?
She even gets sponsored by a foundation.

496
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:47,259
-Good for you. She gets money.
-I am envious.

497
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:50,721
She throws free money everywhere.

498
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,098
I know.

499
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:55,684
How can they say such words
without any hesitation?

500
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:10,658
JU GA-YOUNG

501
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,097
Do you want to be my girl?

502
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:35,349
Excuse me?

503
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,858
People won't leave you alone.

504
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:45,818
What?

505
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,195
What can I do for you?

506
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:52,324
Should I get revenge or make them regret
it for the rest of their lives?

507
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,829
-What are you...
-I'll just do both.

508
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,374
I am an actor,

509
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,835
and there is a genre
that I always wanted to do.

510
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:14,889
You are Ju Ga-young.

511
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,057
The one
those assholes were just talking about.

512
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:18,601
I will help you.

513
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,187
Who are you?

514
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,898
Someone who has been in your place.

515
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:29,236
Men who play with women's hearts are
the ones I hate the most.

APPLICATION FOR THEOLOGY DEPARTMENT

517
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,129
So, you are really doing this?

518
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:53,135
Mother, did you search my room?

519
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,430
I've been telling you not to go there.

520
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,891
I've been telling you
for the last ten years,

521
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,684
and you need to do this?

522
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:03,896
So I've thought about this
for the last ten years.

523
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,606
And I've concluded...

524
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,193
I am going.

525
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,278
Do you want me to die?

526
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:15,282
Doctor, policeman, judge, lawyer,
prosecutor...

527
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,327
There are many things you can do
to help people.

528
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,538
Why do you have to be a priest?

529
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,541
I can't help it.

530
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:25,960
I tried not to be one, too,

531
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,671
but I couldn't help it.

532
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,883
I endured all the pain to give birth
to you. I'm not giving you to him.

533
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:37,012
I've neither heard his voice
or talked to him.

534
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:40,224
I can't do it. I can't!

535
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:58,993
Take this. I've been saving money
to give to you before I leave.

536
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,619
Who said I need money?

537
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,621
I don't need money.

538
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:08,085
Once you go there, you don't get to see
family or friends for years.

539
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:09,712
Why do you have to live like that?

540
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,009
Why do you have to walk that path?
Why you?

541
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:29,064
Mom, I've made up my mind already.

542
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,570
If you want to decide everything
on your own, get out!

543
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:35,613
Mom!

544
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:40,367
Get out! When you go there,
you won't be my son anymore anyway!

545
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:58,135
I have to go to work. I will be back.

546
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,776
When things like this happen...

547
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,990
I wish I weren't so nice
that I cannot even swear.

548
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:47,494
Really.

549
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:59,173
Director Choi, is T-Road our competitor?

550
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:07,931
Then why should I do STP analysis
on a sister company?

551
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,559
We expected this.

552
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:16,648
They do what they do and we do what we do
to achieve the market share.

553
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:18,317
Stay the course.

554
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:31,747
Huh?

555
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,796
I looked everywhere for you,
and you were at my house all along.

556
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:50,390
Yes.

557
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,354
He must be working to be an entertainer.

558
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:57,481
He is so handsome!

559
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:11,078
Oh, he looked at me!

560
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,921
Why aren't you picking up the phone?

561
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,465
Are you trying to torture me?

562
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:28,470
I was dying to see you!

563
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,433
Take it!

564
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:41,650
Next line, quickly!

565
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,072
I told you not to call me like that.

566
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:51,076
This is burdensome.

567
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:53,662
Nice lines!

568
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:56,874
You think I want to do this?

569
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,834
I can't help it,
because I am in love with you!

570
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,715
Audience reaction is good, too.

571
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:08,719
Ju Ga-young?

572
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:12,598
Is that him?

573
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,558
The one you're playing with?

574
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:15,767
What?

575
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:21,106
That is him. The one
who doesn't even know he's being played.

576
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:30,657
Ga-young, you choose. Him or me?

577
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:45,172
Don't go.

578
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:01,188
Min-woo,

579
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,984
you... are ugly.

580
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,868
So stop acting up.

581
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:16,703
What the...

582
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,374
Don't touch my girl.
Last blow!

583
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:23,835
You bastard!

584
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:27,673
Oh, it's gonna be like this, huh? OK.

585
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:31,301
Come at me one by one.

586
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,971
Hold on! What do I do?

587
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:36,932
OK, two at a time.

588
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,602
What are you doing? Come here.

589
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:44,731
-Ddolgi, Ddungi, Hochi, Sechom...
-Nope.

590
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:48,360
-Trago, Yorong, Macho, Mimi...
-Wrong.

591
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,113
Why can't you get it right one time?

592
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,992
Did you fall in love so hard
you can't think?

593
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:56,368
I know who he is.

594
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:59,079
How can you not know?
He is the only different one.

595
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:02,582
I know. Why is he different?

596
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:06,503
Why are you asking a question out loud
to yourself? Do you want attention?

597
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:11,258
Mr. Jung, have you ever been excited
for a man's body?

598
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:17,639
That's not it.

599
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:21,518
I said that's not it.

600
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:34,072
Yes?

601
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:37,200
Is this Seo Do-jae's father?
This is the police.

602
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:39,703
We picked up your son for assault.

603
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,414
My son?

604
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:43,665
Yes, your son.

605
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,625
I am asking this just in case.

606
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:49,254
What year is it over there?

607
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:20,494
Seo Do-jae?

608
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:23,038
Father!

609
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:31,129
It looks like you had your son
by accident!

610
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,925
That explains him.

611
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:38,929
That's why we should separate the kids
who don't have proper parents.

612
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:43,141
The statement you just made shows
what a great person you are.

613
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:46,895
What did my son do wrong?

614
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:51,733
That poor girl seduced my son first.
She should've thought about who she is.

615
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:55,112
Your language is so harsh!

616
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:57,155
Look at him!

617
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:59,741
How dare you stare at me, you little punk?

618
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:02,661
Why do you even try to talk to them?

619
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:05,330
Let the law handle this.
File a lawsuit.

620
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:07,749
They don't know how scary the law is.

621
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:12,295
Excuse me, your son hit me first.

622
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:15,674
But I was so agile that I avoided it.

623
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:23,014
Your sons were following us,
and tripped. It was really funny.

624
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,099
Hey!

625
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,351
You bastard!

626
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:31,982
-Are you OK? You're not bleeding?
-I'm fine.

627
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,527
What? You say you're bleeding a liter?

628
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,988
You feel like you're going to pass out?

629
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:45,203
Oh! I think I broke my leg!
Call an ambulance!

630
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:47,247
I might die!

631
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:50,917
Lawsuit sounds good. Let's do it.

632
00:52:57,799 --> 00:52:59,759
What is this act?

633
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:04,264
Sunho Group, T-Road?

634
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:06,683
I contacted our legal team.

635
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:10,145
After determining assailants and victims,

636
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:11,897
we will let the court handle it.

637
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:15,358
Including this assault case.

638
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:20,614
The kids were just playing around!

639
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:22,741
We don't need to talk about the law!

640
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:25,577
-You're the one who brought up the law.
-When did I say that?

641
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,542
Why did you help me?

642
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:33,877
Because I love you.

643
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,590
No, I mean what is the real reason?

644
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,886
Because tteok-bokki
you bought for me that day was so good?

645
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:46,848
Thank you.

646
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,184
You are welcome.

647
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:50,769
Go.

648
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,689
Can I have your number?

649
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:01,279
-I am going abroad to study.
-Going abroad?

650
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,949
-To where?
-France.

651
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,576
-You know the Cannes, right?
-Cannes?

652
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:12,832
I will come back when I am
a better fit for you.

653
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:18,213
Even the ending is perfect.

654
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:20,840
Your acting was great!

655
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:25,178
It was an honor to act with you.

656
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,015
The honor is mine.

657
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:47,909
I knew you were good,
but I did not know you were this good.

658
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,538
You never really know people.

659
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,164
That's why you get stabbed in the back.

660
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,458
-Why did you come?
-Because you had them call me.

661
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:59,296
So you did not miss me,
but you came just because they called.

662
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:01,756
-What are you talking about?
-You said you were uncomfortable.

663
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:04,217
Look ahead if you don't want to crash.

664
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:06,136
Don't look at me
since I make you uncomfortable.

665
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,935
Do I make you so uncomfortable
I have to get out?

666
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,687
I am asking what you mean by that.

667
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:19,691
You said you wanted me back soon,

668
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:21,985
as I made you uncomfortable.
What does that mean?

669
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:24,404
It means you don't like me as I am.

670
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:28,325
You said you would recognize me
and that you're not prejudiced.

671
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,869
But you are just like others.

672
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,042
Are you sore about it?

673
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,668
I am not sore! I am just angry!

674
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:41,713
You caused trouble and called me
because you felt so sore?

675
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:43,840
As your dad, not even as your brother.

676
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:46,092
I still had to take care of urgent...

677
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,303
I said I was not sore, I was angry!

678
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,017
We have a promotional event in a week.

679
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,520
So I need our model Han Se-gye.

680
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:58,980
What?

681
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:03,318
There is no other reason for me to feel
uncomfortable. Especially me.

682
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:09,157
To me, you've always been you.

683
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:13,870
If I said I felt uncomfortable,
it was because of the event.

684
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:18,541
Why didn't you say that?
You made me misunderstand.

685
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:22,879
Agreed. I only thought about this
from my perspective.

686
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:25,090
I should've put myself in your shoes, too.

687
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:27,926
If you admit it so quickly,

688
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:32,055
I feel ashamed and sorry.

689
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,307
Do you feel sorry?

690
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:37,852
I do. I am sorry for calling you
for something like this,

691
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:43,024
misunderstanding you,
and getting drunk and stuff.

692
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,276
Then, live with me.

693
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:48,488
You wanted to sleep together,
and now you want to live together?

694
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,240
Think of this as probation.

695
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:54,828
I am worried you might to go prison
before our business ends.

696
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:58,331
-But we are a man and a woman.
-What's the matter? We are both men.

697
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,500
I already apologized
for what I said before!

698
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:02,669
You have nowhere to go anyway.

699
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,462
-That's not true.
-Yes it is.

700
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,430
I will pay back with my labor.

701
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,307
I broke your valuable light,

702
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:17,851
so I'll pay with labor.

703
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:21,020
No, pay it off with money.

704
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:25,150
I don't have money.
I will work in-house until I pay that off.

705
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:29,070
What made you think I would let
a man stay in my home as a maid?

706
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,364
I've already been doing it.

707
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,659
-That's dif--
-And you are satisfied.

708
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:39,706
-I am satisfied, but--
-I plan to be a priest.

709
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:45,253
You mean a bride, as opposed to a groom?

710
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:47,714
No, as in priest or nun.

711
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,886
I am not interested in women.

712
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,638
That includes you.

713
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,435
-Still...
-Help me, please.

714
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,191
Is it not possible?

715
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:20,079
So, you are living there for a while?

716
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:24,125
What other options do I have?
Where are you?

717
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,003
Even A-rham does not know where you are.

718
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:31,382
I am well. Don't try to find out more.

719
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:52,779
I am out of my mind.

720
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,593
What a a strange woman.

721
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:26,104
-Aren't you coming?
-I am!

722
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:29,232
Who exercises so early in the morning?

723
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:33,820
Looking back,
it was a series of strange days.

724
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:38,491
Oh!

725
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,245
Those are the ones I bought for you.

726
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,082
I bought this.

727
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:48,918
I ate with someone
as if nothing had happened.

728
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:53,840
Have a good day! Bye!

729
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:58,469
I said bye to someone
as if nothing had happened.

730
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:15,903
What if we make a love story like that?

731
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,615
You fall in love with my beautiful heart.

732
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:22,076
So you confess your love within a week
after we met.

733
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:23,453
Me?

734
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:25,038
Then, you say this!

735
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:27,999
"You are the nicest woman I ever met."

736
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:30,835
Me?

737
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:41,095
I joked with someone
as if nothing had happened.

738
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:52,899
This feels strange.

739
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:57,028
This is the first time anyone else takes
a picture for me.

740
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:02,200
At one, two, three.

741
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:10,458
Do you like it?

742
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:12,752
Very much!

743
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:21,052
We recognized each other
as if nothing had happened.

744
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:25,556
Han Se-gye!

745
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:32,563
Han Se-gye!

746
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:39,862
Han Se-gye!

747
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,115
Because nothing felt special,

748
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:45,118
they were special days.

749
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:14,647
Did you sleep well?

750
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:20,027
Yes.

751
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:22,488
I did.

752
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:26,576
For the first time,
I was disappointed when I came back.

753
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:44,552
You look good.

754
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:46,262
Did you visit a happy place?

755
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:50,558
I've just had ordinary days.

756
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,643
Can I guess?

757
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:55,813
L.O.V.E. Love!

758
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:58,316
You must be in love.

759
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,862
You cannot fool me.

760
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,782
OK. That's good.

761
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,456
Tteok-bokki, please.

762
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:16,542
Oh my goodness. You are here.

763
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,836
Why haven't you come by for so long?

764
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:22,048
So you have a boyfriend?

765
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:23,674
Yes...

766
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:26,344
-Enjoy!
-Thank you.

767
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:41,776
Tteok-bokki, please.

768
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,616
Do you want my autograph?

769
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:50,451
No.

770
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:04,507
They have good tteok-bokki here, right?

771
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:05,466
Huh?

772
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,470
Thank you.

773
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:14,809
For... what?

774
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:17,520
For lots of things.

775
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:28,739
Aren't you going to answer that?
It is loud.

776
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:32,743
Hello!

777
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:34,495
You finally picked up!

778
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,677
I sent your 200 million won back.

779
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:52,221
I kept 100 won as it was my money.

780
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:56,267
I would like to apologize.

781
01:04:57,184 --> 01:05:00,313
I was too rude.
I am usually not like that.

782
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,315
I am sorry.

783
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:07,820
So you are giving me things?

784
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,781
Because money is easy to return?

785
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:12,825
That is not it.

786
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:18,039
Please take good care of Do-jae.

787
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:21,792
All of a sudden?

788
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:26,005
I know I am fixing the barn
after losing my cows.

789
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:28,799
So...

790
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,616
If I want to have Cinderella back,

791
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:57,161
I should return her lost shoe.

792
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,250
Would you...

793
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,670
be my Cinderella?

794
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:07,588
Excuse me?

795
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:12,385
LOOKING FOR CINDERELLA
WE WILL BE YOUR GLASS SHOE

796
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:15,221
-Congratulations for winning the event!
-Thank you!

797
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:34,156
FIRST CLASS UPGRADE

798
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:07,690
It is good.

799
01:07:35,926 --> 01:07:38,262
I saw him a lot with his face.

800
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:42,558
I do not see him even once with this face.

801
01:08:09,543 --> 01:08:12,254
HAN SE-GYE?

802
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:19,678
HAN SE-GYE.

803
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:31,315
AUNTIE

804
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:33,234
Hello?

805
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:36,195
I just called to tell you
the event was successful.

806
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:39,281
Yes, I saw the picture.

807
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:42,785
Oh, you did?

808
01:08:45,412 --> 01:08:46,705
Why didn't you say anything?

809
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:50,501
So the headquarters directors usually
don't attend the event?

810
01:08:50,584 --> 01:08:53,879
We don't. We get a briefing.

811
01:08:56,715 --> 01:08:58,175
Couldn't you just come?

812
01:08:58,425 --> 01:08:59,468
Why?

813
01:09:00,427 --> 01:09:01,345
Excuse me?

814
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:03,055
Why do you miss me?

815
01:09:05,182 --> 01:09:08,894
When did I say I missed you?
You are so silly.

816
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:12,064
It is just that when I work hard,

817
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:17,945
if you just play around, I would feel
jealous and I get mad, so I asked.

818
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:20,906
So you called me because you missed me?

819
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:22,908
No!

820
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:27,037
I just called to ask something.

821
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:30,958
Is my razor there?

822
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:33,210
No. I threw it away.

823
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:36,755
Why do you throw away
someone else's stuff? You are weird.

824
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:39,884
Isn't it weirder to have someone else's
stuff at my house?

825
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:41,677
If that is all, I will hang up.

826
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:42,928
Just a second.

827
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:44,180
Now what?

828
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:46,182
That...

829
01:09:49,476 --> 01:09:53,439
That movie we started watching together,
we didn't finish.

830
01:09:53,772 --> 01:09:55,399
Don't watch it by yourself.

831
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:58,611
You fell asleep right after it began.

832
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:01,864
No, I didn't. I was just closing my eyes.

833
01:10:03,115 --> 01:10:04,617
OK. I won't watch it.

834
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:06,994
Now we are good, right? Bye.

835
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:08,287
Control tower!

836
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:13,792
Have you been to the control tower?

837
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,212
Why are you asking?

838
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:20,507
Just curious.

839
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:21,717
Aren't you sleepy?

840
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:24,094
No, I am not.

841
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:26,472
The let's meet for a bit.

842
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:39,193
Will this be OK?

843
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:42,321
Of course. It is mine.

844
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:43,364
Really?

845
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:46,116
To be exact, it is my grandfather's.

846
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:50,663
It is a training center
for T-Road controllers.

847
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:53,707
When there is no training,

848
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,252
I can use it for personal purposes,
like now.

849
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:58,087
Are we really going in here?

850
01:10:58,170 --> 01:10:59,797
You said you were curious.

851
01:11:53,183 --> 01:11:54,101
This is insane.

852
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:58,522
I understand. I felt the same way
when I first came here.

853
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:00,816
Do you come here often?

854
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:04,695
Usually more than once a week.

855
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:08,490
We have to maintain the equipment
and do training.

856
01:12:09,074 --> 01:12:11,076
I have a lot to check and report.

857
01:12:14,538 --> 01:12:16,373
Why do you work so hard?

858
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:20,502
Isn't this a family business anyway?

859
01:12:21,086 --> 01:12:23,047
It is not something you wanted, right?

860
01:12:24,256 --> 01:12:26,258
Especially with your condition.

861
01:12:29,219 --> 01:12:30,929
Because I don't want to lose it.

862
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:40,356
I felt that way at first.

863
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:42,566
But then, it amazed me.

864
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:46,570
Those who might never have met
get to see each other

865
01:12:46,945 --> 01:12:49,281
from opposite sides of the world.

866
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:51,575
They love,

867
01:12:52,409 --> 01:12:54,411
and even live together sometimes.

868
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:02,920
I help those
who otherwise would never meet.

869
01:13:04,588 --> 01:13:09,093
I help those
who otherwise would never love.

870
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:13,097
That is what I do.

871
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,604
Sounds like destiny.

872
01:13:22,189 --> 01:13:23,023
Us?

873
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,141
Sorry.

874
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:42,352
What does it mean for a man
to kiss someone

875
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:44,146
and pretend like nothing happened?

876
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:46,648
-Are you really dating him?
-Dating? No way!

877
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:48,609
Why isn't he calling? Why not?

878
01:14:48,692 --> 01:14:50,068
It has been an hour already.

879
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:51,278
What are you doing?

880
01:14:51,361 --> 01:14:52,321
I've done this a lot.

881
01:14:52,404 --> 01:14:54,114
So I have a lot to think about.

882
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:56,283
I usually don't tell others
something like this.

883
01:14:56,366 --> 01:15:00,329
It is because no one listened
to you before. I will listen.

884
01:15:00,412 --> 01:15:03,707
I am not used to this,
so I couldn't say it.

885
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:06,919
How can I say it? I am a mess.

886
01:15:07,544 --> 01:15:10,672
Just say it. I am a mess, too.

887
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:18,055
