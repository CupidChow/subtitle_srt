EPISODE 11

2
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,634
I just arrived.

3
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,890
It's OK. It will be done soon.

4
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,975
Gging-ggang?

5
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,644
She is still with Eun-ho.

6
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,780
My mom did a good job on her house.

7
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:17,577
She already cleaned up,
so there wasn't much to do.

8
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:21,790
Nothing much.

9
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,753
A picture of my mom, and her planter.

10
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,802
I came home now.

11
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,140
I will call you later.

12
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,434
OK.

13
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,243
The house looks peaceful

14
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,203
without me.

15
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:14,384
You are driving me crazy, Han Se-gye.

16
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,264
Stop eating instant food.

17
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,392
And do the dishes right after you eat!

18
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:24,936
It stinks!

19
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,853
Don't let the food I made go bad.

20
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,107
Do you understand?

21
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,516
She made me a lot of food.

22
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,370
I told you to put dirty socks
in the laundry basket.

23
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,205
So dirty!

24
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,208
You are dirty, Han Se-gye!

25
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,660
The dramas these days are so predictable.

26
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,414
Don't you do dramas?

27
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,400
It's embarrassing to do this alone.

28
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,612
How do you do this all the time?
You are amazing.

29
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,955
Daughter. Did you eat?

30
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:32,582
Yes.

31
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,834
Did you eat instant food again?

32
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,129
Take care of your health
when you are healthy.

33
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,715
Did you do the dishes?

34
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,383
I did.

35
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,636
What about cleaning? And laundry?

36
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,098
You don't do it until I tell you to.

37
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,392
I did those, too.

38
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,854
Are you going to sleep now?

39
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,522
Yes.

40
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,274
Good night.

41
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,818
Sleep well, without dreaming.

42
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,528
You, too.

43
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,697
Sleep well without dreaming.

44
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,617
You've done a lot today.

45
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,410
My pretty daughter.

46
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,956
You have done so much today too, Mom.

47
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,834
My pretty mom.

48
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,295
Have a good day tomorrow!

49
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,507
My daughter is the best.

50
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,178
OK. Have a good day tomorrow!

51
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,472
Your daughter is the best.

52
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,979
Did it record well?

53
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,662
Have a good day tomorrow!

54
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,040
Your daughter is the best.

55
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:03,965
Hello.

56
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,341
Hi.

57
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:06,717
Hello.

58
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:07,969
Will you be alright?

59
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,262
I'm fine.

60
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,097
Hello.

61
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,187
-Hello!
-Hi.

62
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,772
You came!

63
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,235
There was a long delay because of me,
wasn't there?

64
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:26,737
I'm sorry.

65
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,197
And...

66
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,951
thank you for coming

67
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,203
to say goodbye to my mom.

68
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,665
I should thank you for coming here.

69
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,170
Don't push too hard.
If it's too difficult, just tell me.

70
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,340
OK. Let's get started.

71
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,848
I will take them all.

72
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,643
I will let you find peace.

73
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,320
Cut, OK!

74
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,071
It's "Cut OK!"

75
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,412
Look at her cold eyes,
even in this heart-breaking situation.

76
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,915
Wow, she is a professional!

77
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,252
I was so surprised!
Holding you like this...

78
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,507
SE-GYE FLEES AT SHOOT

79
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,799
SE-GYE FLEES AGAIN

80
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,642
SE-GYE HAS A SON

81
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,946
Something's suspicious.

82
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,532
There definitely is something.

83
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,367
Why?

84
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,786
Is there something? What is it?

85
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,204
Are we friends?

86
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,623
Why do you talk to me?

87
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,208
Just keep driving.

88
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,759
Hello? Yes.

89
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,844
I want to have someone followed.

90
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,687
I will pay tonight
to show my appreciation.

91
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,273
Order anything, and everything!

92
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,734
It was nothing.
You don't need to thank us.

93
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,111
We are friends.

94
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,196
If I don't say it, you won't know.

95
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,993
There are so many important things
you need to say so others will know.

96
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,204
If I don't say it, you'll never know.

97
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,876
I'm going to impart some knowledge on you,

98
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,628
my young friends.

99
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,674
Say what you want to say, right away.

100
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,927
-Hey!
-Yes?

101
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,179
I love you.

102
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:58,806
Suddenly?

103
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,434
Gross!

104
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,478
You said I should say it.

105
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,649
Hey, I love you too.

106
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,277
Really gross!

107
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,195
Do you need money?

108
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,490
I work as a designated driver.
I have plenty of money.

109
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,160
Do you really need to do that, too?

110
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,455
Should I give you money?
How much? 100 million won?

111
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,332
Long time no see!

112
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,666
You want egg omelets?

113
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,127
I added an extra egg.

114
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,255
-Oh, thank you!
-Thank you!

115
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,509
So good!

116
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,721
What is her secret?

117
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,057
My mom did not make good ones.

118
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,185
Cooking this is harder than it looks.

119
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:00,618
Oh!

120
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:05,247
I'm sorry. I made things weird.

121
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,709
I'm fine.

122
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,712
I'm fine.
I said that only because it was good.

123
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:15,341
She was right.

124
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:17,635
What is.

125
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,303
Someone said that...

126
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,806
you would pretend you're OK,

127
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,059
but you really aren't.

128
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,440
You poor thing!

129
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,860
I'm sad for you.

130
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:41,867
Hey...

131
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,537
That's not true. I'm really fine.

132
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,373
Just stay there. Don't let go.

133
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,053
I'm going home now.

134
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,139
Did you drink a lot?

135
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,684
A little bit!

136
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,269
Are you OK?

137
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,603
I'm fine.

138
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,772
Better than I thought.

139
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,442
I mean it.

140
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,113
I wish

141
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,658
I could be with you
from morning until night.

142
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,578
I haven't heard that in a while.

143
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,621
But your friends have

144
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,875
loved you longer than I have.

145
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,878
I won't barge in. I will just wait here.

146
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,880
Too bad.

147
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,215
I wish I'd met you a little sooner.

148
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,759
What's that?

149
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,720
Are you being smart or cold?

150
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,225
The filming will end soon.

151
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:52,772
Then, let's be together

152
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,232
from morning until night.

153
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,278
Good night.

154
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,072
I will call you again.

155
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:03,949
Good night!

156
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:22,927
Mother!

157
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,229
I stopped the reporters for now.

158
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,648
I heard you were at the funeral.

159
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,818
You didn't have to do that.

160
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,655
Why not?

161
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,990
She's already having a tough time.

162
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,034
Rumors'll only make it harder.

163
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,914
I was not considerate enough.

164
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,333
Thank you mother.

165
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:01,799
Do you love her?

166
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,051
Yes.

167
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,930
Does she know about your disorder?

168
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,140
She does.

169
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,854
Then why are you here?

170
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,399
When your father left for another country,

171
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,443
I only focused on my work and you.

172
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,445
Then you got hurt.

173
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:29,368
I couldn't do anything. I was helpless.

174
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:33,831
That was the first time
my world collapsed on me.

175
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,380
When you opened your eyes,
Prof. Kang said

176
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:47,136
"If Do-jae is your light,
I will be your soil."

177
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,638
After hearing that,

178
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,601
I thought this man would never leave me,

179
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,062
no matter what happens.

180
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,482
That includes

181
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,776
the most painful moments.

182
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,283
There are more important things
than work.

183
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,160
I missed...

184
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,996
a lot of those.

185
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,460
Go to her, and then...

186
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,795
take care of her in every way.

187
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,174
Don't hold back. Don't wait for your turn.

188
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,635
Don't be logical either.

189
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,012
If your love is real,

190
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,349
that's what you need to do.

191
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:54,536
He is dumb, just like me.

192
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,172
I didn't expect you.

193
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,757
I'm dumb.

194
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,258
Excuse me?

195
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:12,888
I'm so dumb... that I came just now.

196
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,404
Oh my god.

197
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,202
I thought I was OK, but I must not be.

198
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:37,579
Maybe...

199
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,499
I'm having a really hard time.

200
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,187
I'm so bad.

201
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,148
Why?

202
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,276
Because I'm so selfish.

203
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,988
I thought only I was hurting,

204
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,866
only I was having a hard time.

205
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,285
But you hurt, too.

206
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,496
You are having a hard time, too.

207
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,749
I just make it worse.

208
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,677
If you find out how selfish my love is...

209
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,057
you will be shocked.

210
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,024
I love you because of me.

211
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,945
When I'm with you,

212
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,033
I feel normal.

213
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,913
I feel like...

214
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,333
I'm living an absolutely

215
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,252
perfectly normal life.

216
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,519
It's OK to be bad.

217
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,523
It's OK to hate everyone.

218
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,527
I love you that way, too.

219
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:39,201
If you are not pretty,
I will still love you.

220
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,205
Because you are complete.

221
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,458
I love you.

222
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,421
Me, too.

223
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,092
You're like a miracle to me.

224
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,326
On my birthday,

225
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,871
I got potted flowers.

226
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,541
The meaning of the flowers was

227
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,879
"Happiness that comes no matter what."

228
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,343
Welcome!

229
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,344
By any chance,

230
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:44,141
do you have a flower that means
"Happiness that comes no matter what?"

231
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,310
Oh, you are talking about marigolds.

232
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,604
Marigolds...

233
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,648
The funny thing about marigolds is

234
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,984
that they have two meanings.

235
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,863
MARIGOLD MEANING

236
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:11,543
THE SECOND MEANING IS
SADNESS FROM SEPARATION

237
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,175
I knew it.

238
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,390
Second place is

239
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,143
always my place.

240
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,297
It was this flower, right?

241
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,305
I kept thinking about it...

242
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,228
What's this?

243
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,897
Even if it's not with me,

244
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,692
the happiness will still come to you.

245
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,451
You came... to say that?

246
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,083
This is why

247
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,211
I don't like a good person.

248
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,926
If what I said makes you uncomfortable,

249
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,553
just forget it.

250
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:46,805
Those words...

251
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,059
just came out of my mouth.

252
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,689
I just reacted
because you were kind to me.

253
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,235
I'm not such a reckless person.

254
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,196
I shouldn't have said that.

255
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:12,414
I submitted my application
to a theology college.

256
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:24,134
Do you have anything to say to me?

257
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:28,805
No.

258
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,482
What...

259
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,110
did I want to hear?

260
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:57,667
Cut, OK!

261
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,920
-Nicely done!
-We did it!

262
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,006
-Thank you.
-Good work!

263
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,508
Nice job!

264
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,593
Good work!

265
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,179
Great work, everyone!

266
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,394
It was great work, Director.

267
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,314
Thank you for giving me the opportunity

268
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,483
and for trusting me.

269
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,653
Looking at you...

270
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:30,325
I thought maybe it is
I who really changed.

271
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,662
You are still the same.

272
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,332
But I judged you based on what I heard.

273
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,043
I'm sorry.

274
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,089
Thank you...

275
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,342
for giving me a chance.

276
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,639
It was good to see you again.

277
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,731
Thank you.

278
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,865
-Spicy one.
-Good!

279
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,494
Great work.

280
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,247
I won't see you soon. 

281
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,545
Who knows? We might meet again soon.

282
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,182
UNCLE

283
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,437
Are you done?

284
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,566
Wow, how did you know?

285
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:47,277
Because I've been waiting for this day.

286
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,446
Where should I go?

287
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:50,780
Here.

288
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,875
Really?

289
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,003
Did you really rent this entire cabin?

290
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,094
My boyfriend does not mess around!

291
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:56,429
No, your boyfriend does not mess around.

292
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,822
Hello, Director.

293
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:17,033
I am the pilot of this flight,
Bae Min-seok.

294
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,578
I hope to provide you with
a pleasant flight.

295
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,580
Please take good care of us.

296
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,926
Didn't this come next?

297
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,764
I've never seen the pilot greet
the passengers before.

298
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,810
Is that so? I'm used to it.

299
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,399
So funny.

300
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,776
I had no idea we'd be like this.

301
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,403
I kind of knew.

302
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,365
Because I was nervous.

303
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,536
When you leaned on my shoulder,

304
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,496
I couldn't turn the page.

305
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,540
Really?

306
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,918
Ah, that was my secret.

307
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,009
How about now?

308
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,136
Are you still nervous?

309
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:20,722
Now...

310
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,600
it's your turn to be nervous.

311
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,647
Look over there.

312
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,450
Say hello to your mom.

313
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,125
This is the closest place to heaven.

314
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,903
I remember when I first bought the fish.

315
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,048
The fish, swimming in the blue aquarium,

316
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,510
looked like they were flying in the sky.

317
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,597
So I used to sit and look at them
for a long time.

318
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:03,533
There was a time
when the fish was my entire world.

319
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:08,288
My unchanging, strange world.

320
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:30,101
My strange woman
who walked in my strange world...

321
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,747
About my dad...

322
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,376
My mom said

323
00:29:56,669 --> 00:30:00,840
my dad suddenly appeared
and suddenly became kind.

324
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,511
He suddenly made her love him,

325
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,430
and then suddenly left.

326
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,067
You did the same.

327
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,404
You suddenly showed up in my life.

328
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,866
You suddenly became kind

329
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,369
and suddenly made me love you.

330
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,914
I won't disappear.

331
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,002
Are you sure?

332
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:42,340
So you don't disappear, either.

333
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:53,351
I hope this strange woman will be
strangely happy,

334
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:59,649
very strangely happy, for a long time.

335
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,246
-I'll take a pic of you, too.
-Huh?

336
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,044
One more time.

337
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,757
It's a good pic. Look!

338
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,597
Isn't this a good pic?

339
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,056
-This?
-This!

340
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,934
So that I can be happy, too.

341
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,530
Do you remember when I turned into a kid?

342
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,744
My mom and I...

343
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,622
spent time together like when I was a kid.

344
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,917
We ate together,

345
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,837
we watched TV together,
and we slept together.

346
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:07,842
I didn't know it then,

347
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,680
but I think those moments were for now.

348
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,143
There are moments whose meaning
you realize

349
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,937
only after time passes.

350
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,608
What kind of moment will this be for us
after time passes?

351
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:30,990
I hope we can remember this
as a happy moment.

352
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,368
It might not be a happy moment.

353
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:35,870
Why?

354
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,456
Are you going to make me happier?

355
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:47,340
I will be happier,

356
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,802
as my mom would want that.

357
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,347
She wouldn't want me

358
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,351
to be sad and crying.

359
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:02,939
I will laugh a lot...

360
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,693
and love a lot.

361
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:12,240
Are you declaring a love war?

362
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,033
Yes.

363
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,744
I will make you happy,

364
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:22,750
on and on, for a long time.

365
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,132
So days like this will be ordinary.

366
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:14,552
Oh, you are busy, huh?

367
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:17,638
You know that and still enter
without an appointment?

368
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,266
There you go again.

369
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,019
Don't sound so disappointed.

370
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:27,023
We belong to the same company.
We are like family.

371
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:30,109
Shouldn't you be happy if family visits?

372
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,362
You know, sometimes, I feel

373
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,323
like you are ice cold.

374
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,492
What nonsense are you talking about?

375
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,493
Choi Gi-ho.

376
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,119
He came back to Korea.

377
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:42,622
Oh?

378
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,832
Didn't you know?

379
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,878
I know your wedding is not based on love.

380
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:51,631
But how do you not know that
your fiance is back?

381
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,176
Anyway,

382
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,262
you are so clever.

383
00:34:58,846 --> 00:34:59,931
Brilliant!

384
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,141
I must say

385
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,353
President Choi is a good choice

386
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,105
to strengthen your power.

387
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,523
He's a traditional man.

388
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,150
I'm the oldest son in that family.

389
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,529
But he is a total scumbag, though.

390
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,155
Mr. Kim!

391
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,203
The way you just addressed me,

392
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:25,414
it was more than being cold. I'm scared!

393
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:26,791
I will go.

394
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:30,628
I don't have any other intention.

395
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:33,339
I came here in good faith
just to let you know.

396
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:36,592
So you don't get upset.

397
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,804
I really have to go now. Bye!

398
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,558
It is strange. I would be worried...

399
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,018
Whatever.

400
00:35:58,447 --> 00:35:59,532
I'm a driver.

401
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,534
Go to the VIP room.

402
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,418
You are crazy!

403
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,670
You're meeting your fiancée tomorrow.

404
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:18,217
Hey. Kang Sa-ra may be my fiancée,
but our relationship is just business.

405
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,095
This will not cause any problem.

406
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,974
Do you think she didn't know I do this
when she decided to marry me?

407
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:29,645
She is marrying me
because I have something she needs.

408
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,899
You talk as if you wouldn't gain
anything from her.

409
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,820
You're trying to destroy Sunho Group,
using Kang Sa-ra.

410
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,239
I know.

411
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:41,866
Ah.

412
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:45,953
Seo Do-jae came to me to butter me up
when I was angry.

413
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,580
You should have seen it.

414
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,249
It was so much fun.

415
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,087
You got a great wedding gift for her.

416
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,137
What is this?

417
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,015
-I'm the driver.
-"I'm the driver."

418
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,519
Oh. You are the driver!

419
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,402
Go start the car, then.

420
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,533
Wow Choi Gi-ho,
you still have that temper.

421
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,995
Why? Did I do something wrong?
Is there a problem?

422
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,380
You are the only woman I love.

423
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:39,632
Kang Sa-ra?

424
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,051
Who is she?

425
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,887
Ah! I remember now.

426
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,555
Kang Sa-ra at Oneair?

427
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,978
She is annoying.

428
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,940
She never waves her tail or obeys me.

429
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,403
Marriage is not about love.

430
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:05,241
That woman is crazy
about beating her brother.

431
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:11,163
Ambitious ones are always fun.

432
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,005
"I'm the driver" guy, drive carefully.

433
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,551
What? It's nothing.

434
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:31,535
Look at this!

435
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,204
You are a pro.

436
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:34,663
"Pro?"

437
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:37,208
It's a secret.

438
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:40,753
Aren't you hungry?

439
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,844
Sweetie, I'm so hungry.

440
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,137
Wow!

441
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,264
You are a pro!

442
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,750
-Aren't you Han Se-gye?
-Hi!

443
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:20,751
Hello!

444
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,357
Look at this.

445
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,449
Just a second, please.

446
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,655
-Oh, I'm sorry...
-It's OK.

447
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:36,785
Oh, it's Han Se-gye!

448
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:19,703
Han Se-gye.

449
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,748
It must've been hard
for you to look for me.

450
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:29,046
It must have been difficult
and made you anxious.

451
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,342
You must have thought someone else was me
and got disappointed.

452
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,680
But you didn't give up
and kept looking for me.

453
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:41,183
Thank you.

454
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,019
Thank you so much.

455
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,146
You don't have to thank me.

456
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,607
It was all for myself.

457
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,700
I wanted to surprise you,

458
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,952
but I really frightened you.

459
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,247
Hold it.

460
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,375
I'm not giving it to you yet.

461
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,619
Now, I will recognize you.

462
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,371
No matter what you look like.

463
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:05,517
Let's go back...

464
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:08,020
home.

465
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,616
CHOI GI-HO

466
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,030
SNAIL BRIDE

467
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,285
-Hel--
-Where are you?

468
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:08,747
Where are you?

469
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,417
Don't make me ask again.

470
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,584
At the cathedral.

471
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,545
Which one?

472
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,923
I don't know yet.

473
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:23,929
But... if I don't decide now,

474
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:26,348
I'll have to dwell on it again.

475
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:28,976
Julianus,

476
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:33,897
you'll never know the path
you did not take,

477
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,942
regardless of the destination.

478
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:46,994
How about you try these clothes on once?

479
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:49,621
No.

480
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,624
I have to endure many hours to wear those

481
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,544
and I have to pray harder...

482
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,171
So... well...

483
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,550
It it helps you decide your path,

484
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:06,096
the Lord won't criticize you for doing it.

485
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:32,915
Why?

486
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:36,543
Does it look so good
that you can't take it off?

487
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,860
I asked where you were before.

488
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:04,780
That means...

489
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,742
I would come here.

490
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,456
Is this...

491
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,209
what you wanted to show me?

492
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,506
I wanted to confirm something.

493
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:26,510
Maybe you wanted to test something, no?

494
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:35,519
You don't know

495
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,231
what I gave up to come here.

496
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:42,985
What did you give up?

497
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:50,576
Tell me what you gave up.

498
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:53,579
Why do I have to tell you?

499
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:57,416
I need to hear it to decide
what to give up.

500
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:08,176
Never mind.

501
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:14,266
This was a losing fight
from the beginning.

502
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,813
I thought he would be nice,

503
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,608
but he is pettier than I thought.

504
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:27,279
Is he not negotiating fairly
because I don't believe in him,

505
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:31,992
or...

506
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,745
is he punishing me

507
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,497
for being bad?

508
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,389
Why do you like me?

509
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,602
Because you're pretty.

510
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:44,606
Because I'm worth the money?

511
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,238
In my entire life,

512
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:56,535
I've never seen anyone prettier than you.

513
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:58,996
Because such a pretty person...

514
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,206
listened to me.

515
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,295
Because he comes when I ask him.

516
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,715
Because he cares about what I eat.

517
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:11,800
Sometimes,

518
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,221
Because he feeds me
something too sweet.

519
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,770
What? You don't like what I said?

520
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:28,275
You are engaged to someone, aren't you?

521
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,236
Is his name...

522
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:33,447
Cho Ki-ho?

523
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:38,660
Why did you lie?

524
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,458
I didn't lie.

525
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:48,712
I...

526
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:52,382
just didn't say anything.

527
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,389
At first, I didn't think

528
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,601
I needed  to talk about it.

529
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:04,936
And then,

530
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:09,232
I didn't want to.

531
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:12,861
You are shameless.

532
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:16,615
I know. That is how I am.

533
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,117
But...

534
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,621
why do I like to hear that?

535
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:33,298
A guest already?

536
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:42,849
Let's talk later.

537
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,811
-You can leave now.
-OK.

538
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:49,648
You should've called. You surprised me.

539
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:51,274
That's good.

540
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:52,651
I wanted to.

541
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:55,362
Leave now.
Let's go in and talk.

542
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,127
I will call you. Come when I call.

543
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,506
You said you will come.

544
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:17,217
So,

545
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,220
come when I call you.

546
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,707
I guess you knew I was back,

547
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,125
given your reaction.

548
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,377
I heard, unfortunately.

549
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,503
Who was he?

550
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:57,382
Do you think you can ask that
in our relationship?

551
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:58,800
Of course.

552
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:03,346
Your ambition is too big
for a pretty man.

553
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,639
You are Kang Sa-ra.

554
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,642
Or else you wouldn't be my partner.

555
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,021
-Why are you here?
-No reason.

556
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,232
I don't need a reason to see you.

557
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,276
Is that so?

558
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:18,987
You saw me, so we're done.

559
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,700
Your brother is still a jerk!

560
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:29,873
You don't agree with me.
Have you gotten close?

561
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:32,459
That's not it.

562
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,711
I'm tired. You should leave.

563
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,340
Sunho Group is almost in our hands.

564
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:40,926
I will give it to you.

565
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,554
It's better if you are the lady of Sunho.

566
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:48,308
I will not be the lady, 

567
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:49,851
but the owner.

568
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:53,188
Fine. If that is what you want.

569
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:55,774
Oh, I brought a present.

570
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:56,858
A present?

571
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,488
Since when do you give me presents?

572
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,951
You will like this.

573
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:07,786
Seo's weakness.

574
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,103
What is it?

575
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:36,523
Why do you ask me to drink
as soon as I get to Seoul?

576
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,276
I had no one else to drink with.

577
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:42,404
I'm sorry I asked you to come out.

578
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:45,991
Goodness, call me any time.

579
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:48,785
I always look forward
to comforting you guys.

580
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:57,752
Why?

581
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,880
Why do you drink so much?
It's not like you.

582
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:09,306
It took all my courage to visit her.

583
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:14,978
But she sent me away.

584
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:19,607
She shut the door

585
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:21,568
right in my face.

586
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:27,157
I stood outside the door for a long time.

587
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:29,951
But...

588
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,704
the door never opened.

589
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,124
No matter how long I waited.

590
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:40,545
And then...

591
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:45,508
I realized this must be how she felt.

592
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:48,511
Gosh.

593
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:49,929
Are you drunk?

594
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:52,515
Yes.

595
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,147
What about her?

596
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:01,733
Does she like you?

597
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:05,987
Hey.

598
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,741
I'm telling you this from experience.

599
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,077
Don't keep it inside.

600
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:14,412
No,

601
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:16,414
you can keep your thoughts inside,

602
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:19,292
but you should still tell her.

603
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:23,380
Speak quickly or someone will get hurt.

604
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:25,382
She will?

605
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:29,427
Look at you. You are serious.

606
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:32,138
You are putting her ahead of yourself.

607
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,812
Your first love hit you hard.

608
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:40,313
Right?

609
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:42,273
Love?

610
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:45,777
I don't know yet.

611
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:49,447
I dreamed of being a priest for 10 years.

612
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:54,119
I can't believe I faltered so easily.

613
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,914
Hey, you are the one who dreams.

614
00:56:57,997 --> 00:56:59,249
It doesn't dream you.

615
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:03,128
Who cares if you change your dream?

616
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,130
No one will blame you.

617
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:10,135
If anyone does,
U-mi and I will take care of him.

618
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:17,308
Why should Kang Sa-ra be so pretty?

619
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:21,187
Hey, how did you know?

620
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,773
-What?
-About Kang Sa-ra.

621
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:27,902
I would be dumb not to know.

622
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:32,365
That brother and sister are problems.

623
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:34,742
Sure.

624
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,578
They are.

625
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:57,015
I haven't found
much information about her yet.

626
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,269
No, I know I'm right.

627
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:03,354
I know there's something.

628
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:06,024
Either a kid or a problem.

629
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:08,735
Keep digging.

630
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:11,863
If you find evidence,
I will pay whatever you want.

631
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:13,573
I'll call you again.

632
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:29,589
So pretty!

633
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,966
-Too much!
-One, two, three.

634
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:34,552
Good!

635
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:38,264
Han Se-gye is happy today, as usual.

636
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,725
You are happy whenever you see me.

637
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:42,727
Should I guess why?

638
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:45,813
Isn't it because of L.O.V.E, love?

639
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:48,858
Well, I think the fragrance makes
me happy today.

640
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:50,818
You are pretty.

641
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:52,612
One, two, three.

642
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:55,031
Oof!

643
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:58,159
Hey.

644
00:58:58,243 --> 00:58:59,536
Eun-ho's sick.

645
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:02,038
It's because of love.

646
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:03,498
Se-gye!

647
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:06,960
Did you share a secret
while I was away?

648
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:10,255
Well... that is a secret.

649
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,757
Jeez, that is not fair!

650
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:14,259
I feel sad.

651
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:16,803
Shouldn't have left us behind
for your man.

652
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:19,389
Look who's talking! What about you?

653
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:21,516
You left on a secret trip--

654
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,851
Be quiet.

655
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:25,478
Be quiet about what?

656
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,897
You might be married soon at this rate!

657
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,858
I told you to be quiet.

658
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:33,319
-You might get married.
-Do you think so?

659
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,163
What? Is something wrong?

660
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:45,665
It's just...

661
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:50,878
Maybe I'm mistaken.

662
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:52,380
About marriage?

663
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,674
You might get married.

664
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:56,217
Might I?

665
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,510
You are crazy.

666
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:10,815
I have a strange feeling.

667
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:12,567
Why? What is it?

668
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,613
Do you feel like you're about to change?

669
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:19,073
No, it's not that.

670
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:22,368
Then what?

671
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:25,997
Are you sick? Are you cold and shivering?

672
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,292
That's not it either. It's just...

673
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:33,838
Something is not right. I feel like...

674
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:36,174
someone is watching me.

675
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:38,384
Watching you?

676
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,307
Is a reporter following us?

677
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:45,850
Maybe.

678
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:48,728
Let's be cautious for a while.

679
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,856
When things are weird,
it's best to stay invisible.

680
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:55,860
I will wheedle Reporter Park
into finding out who is following us.

681
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:58,071
Hey.

682
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:00,198
By the way...

683
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:04,452
your mother-in-law is powerful!

684
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,371
She is not my mother-in-law...

685
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:08,956
yet.

686
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:14,337
There has been no media report,
so I asked Reporter Park.

687
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:17,465
He said your mother-in-law blocked
everything.

688
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:19,509
I'm relieved she's got your back.

689
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:27,308
But... I think I'm the one who is sick.

690
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:29,519
Am I the only one who is cold?

691
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:31,938
Why am I shivering?

692
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:35,024
I heard the cold going around is,
a real bad one.

693
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,235
Wear this. Wear more.

694
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,782
The only person who cares about me is

695
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:45,493
you, only Han Se-gye.

696
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:46,786
Hello?

697
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:51,416
Of course. The only person who cares
about me is my sweetie.

698
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:54,877
Do you want something to eat?

699
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:57,338
Yes. The answer is yes.

700
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:58,673
Good.

701
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:01,008
If you said no, I would've insisted.

702
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,760
What do you want to eat?

703
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:09,976
Decide quickly.

704
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:11,894
Sushi!

705
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:17,984
Thanks to your wonderful choice,
we can meet sooner.

706
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:21,070
Really? I'm a good girl!

707
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:25,491
We can talk about the night we had
a fight in the sushi restaurant.

708
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:28,661
You have the edge on that story.

709
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:46,721
-Hey!
-Sorry!

710
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:48,389
I need to change clothes.

711
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:49,724
You really...

712
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:56,063
It's cold!

713
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:59,358
Oh, it is cold.

714
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:01,152
What's all this?

715
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:31,390
Han Se-gye!

716
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:34,602
Were you waiting

717
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,939
for me or for sushi?

718
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,528
I don't care which one.

719
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:46,739
What are you doing? Let's go in.

720
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:56,415
Mr. Seo Do-jae...

721
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:05,716
Mr. Seo Do-jae, I'm...

722
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,888
President You, I'm sorry.

723
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:14,851
I was mistaken as it was dark.

724
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:18,771
Here.

725
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:21,816
Can you take this to Han Se-gye?

726
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,319
Then, bye.

727
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,268
HAN SE-GYE

728
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:00,521
Han Se-gye...

729
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,403
HAN SE-GYE

730
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:11,324
HAN SE-GYE

731
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:14,952
HAN SE-GYE

732
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:16,412
What is...

733
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:19,081
HAN SE-GYE

734
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:20,499
What is this?

735
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:42,730
AUNTIE

736
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:50,446
Are you OK?

737
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,114
U-mi told me.

738
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:54,033
I'll explain it to her.

739
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:56,994
Hello?

740
01:05:58,788 --> 01:05:59,705
Hello?

741
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:19,100
What are you doing?

742
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:20,434
Is this true?

743
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:23,771
I'm asking if this is true.

744
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:28,275
You don't recognize faces?

745
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:58,806
-You scared me!
-It's me.

746
01:06:58,889 --> 01:07:00,016
Is today that day?

747
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:02,727
You had someone follow me? Are you crazy?

748
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:04,645
Is this the secret?

749
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:06,605
I'm very serious now.

750
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:08,566
I'm also seriously happy.

751
01:07:08,649 --> 01:07:12,361
-That's why you were such a jerk.
-Hey!

752
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,947
Is this because of that bastard?

753
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:16,365
I want to know

754
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:19,785
the reason I changed my dream to you.

755
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:27,835
