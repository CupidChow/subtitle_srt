1
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,393
Seo Do-jae, what are you doing here?

2
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,562
Are you busy later?

3
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,648
No, not really.

4
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:06,608
Good.

5
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,987
Then, let's sleep together, later.

6
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,076
Excuse me?

7
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,369
Sleep with me.

8
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,668
Why...

9
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,381
should I...

10
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,094
sleep...

11
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:35,637
with you?

12
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,264
-I've been thinking.
-OK.

13
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,933
That time, on the plane...

14
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,393
-It happened while you slept.
-It did.

15
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,728
-That is why.
-What is that?

16
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,605
No matter how hard I think,
I don't understand.

17
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,607
Not that I can't understand,

18
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,903
but maybe it is not about understanding.

19
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,323
I cannot find any other reason
to explain this.

20
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,867
So, I would like to see

21
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,661
how you change.

22
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,380
Now I get it.

23
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,882
I was about to call 112.

24
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,803
Can you speak more coherently?
You are a headquarters director.

25
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,763
So if my face changes every time I sleep,

26
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,974
did I fall asleep
during the award ceremony?

27
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,308
Didn't you?

28
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,229
You are more simple-minded than I thought.

29
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,482
But I am impressed that you tried
so hard to understand.

30
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,735
I cannot lose
the opportunity to be honest.

31
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,947
So I need to confirm
that you are not deceiving me,

32
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,783
and that I am not crazy.

33
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:40,660
I am scared, too.

34
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,124
EPISODE 4

35
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:49,919
This confirms
that you do not owe anything anymore.

36
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,381
So you are saying there will be no report
or media coverage that says

37
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,304
Seo Do-jae was the actual donor
of the 100 million won, right?

38
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,227
PAY OFF VERIFICATION STATEMENT
NAME: HAN SE-GAE

39
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,272
What is this?

40
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,316
Is there something wrong?

41
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,193
The name is wrong.

42
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:14,944
"Han Se-gae"

43
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,071
It is not "gae." It is "gye."

44
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,199
-Oh!
-Oh?

45
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,992
I must have given you the wrong copy.

46
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,510
-Secretary Jeong--
-"Gye," isn't that correct?

47
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:44,891
Before that!

48
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,434
NAME: HAN SAE-GYE

49
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:49,771
Not "Sae" as in "dog" or "goat."

50
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,983
It is "Se" as in "three",
or "son of a bitch"!

51
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,361
Oh, that was as in "dog."

52
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,280
Anyway, it is "Se."

53
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,631
-Choose the one you like.
-Ms. You just left.

54
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,508
Correction!

55
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,636
As you said you were not busy,
let's go somewhere together.

56
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:22,553
Where?

57
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,223
Ms. You will be here soon.
Answer first, please.

58
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,768
You can call the police
or you can come with me.

59
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,867
You've acted so cool,

60
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,204
and denied so hard.

61
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,415
How pathetic!

62
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,084
-What are you doing?
-I am packing my stuff.

63
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,128
Where does that attitude come from?

64
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,923
Why are you standing there like that?
You make it hard to say no.

65
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,050
I can hear everything.

66
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,178
"I can hear everything." Of course.
I'm saying it out loud so you can hear.

67
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,265
This is called "monologue"
in the industry.

68
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:12,103
Why am I so nice?
No one knows that I am nice.

69
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:14,605
I do know.

70
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,359
Now I know that you are a good person.

71
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,988
What do you mean "now"?
I have always been good.

72
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,893
Did you get home safely that day?

73
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,562
What day?

74
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,234
Oh, you mean the day when the truck almost
hit me and I fell down like this?

75
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,488
The day when I bled so much, but someone
disappeared without even saying goodbye?

76
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,282
Was your arm OK?

77
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,659
Looks like you put a Band-Aid
on your elbow.

78
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,745
No, I was not OK.

79
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,498
My elbow got scratched
and I bled so much, like a liter.

80
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:19,045
A Band-Aid can stop a liter of blood?
Your ability to recover is pretty good.

81
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,005
Or was it the Band-Aid that was good?

82
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:28,930
YOU U-MI.

83
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,395
What are you doing?
Why are you doing that on my phone?

84
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,526
SECRETARY JEONG

85
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:46,656
We're even now.

86
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:50,993
Now we are.

87
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,009
Because I wasn't here...

88
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,596
Hey Se-gye!

89
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:12,723
You're not here?

90
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,688
Han Se-gye you son of...

91
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:22,900
Did you look under the seat?
Maybe she became a little baby.

92
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,986
That is not it. Don't you think
I would know what?

93
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,155
OK, that is good.

94
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,533
Or not.

95
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,537
Anyway, I don't know,
so search somewhere else.

96
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,414
Eun-ho! Hey!

97
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,127
Where did she go?

98
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,424
I am sorry. Let me start over.

99
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:53,347
In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.

100
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:57,018
Trust in the mercy
and blessing of the Lord,

101
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,270
have remorse for the sins
you've committed,

102
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,814
confess the truth.

103
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,774
I am lying to my mom.

104
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,903
She gets upset just hearing
the words "priest school,"

105
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,697
so I could not tell her the truth.

106
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:15,703
Both the Lord and my mom guide me
on their ways.

107
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,747
Which way should I go?

108
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,876
There are too many places
that I have to be.

109
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,795
The Lord does not show the wrong path.

110
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,965
He will be with you
no matter where you go.

111
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,468
Of course. Amen.

112
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,646
Once again, I have to go to the place
that calls me.

113
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,690
-Where to?
-I need to go to my part-time job.

114
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:50,363
The Lord has forgiven your sin.
Go in peace.

115
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,658
Thank you.

116
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,070
Is this where you wanted to go?

117
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:34,699
It's simple. They keep searching for us
because we hide.

118
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,368
And most of all,

119
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,287
it is my territory.

120
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,375
But it is too public.

121
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,942
Jeong, I am going to my office now.

122
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,403
Sure, ancestral rites are important.

123
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,406
I will conclude the contract
with Han Se-gye.

124
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,699
Don't worry.

125
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:17,867
OK.

126
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,421
Did you bring your stamp?

127
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,759
Stamp?

128
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,855
Can I make a signature instead?

129
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,442
It is a big contract,

130
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,611
and that is why I invited you
to come here.

131
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,072
Yeah, it is a big one.

132
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,451
Can I make a big signature?

133
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,714
Hi Jeong. I said it's OK.

134
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:17,301
She will sign the document
at theÂ Strategic Planning Department

135
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,594
and then leave right away.

136
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,514
Yes, she forgot her stamp.

137
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:23,724
Don't worry about work.

138
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,810
Just do our ancestral rites well.

139
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,690
You have absolutely no talent in acting.

140
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,400
Or you are not good at lying.

141
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,694
I am very good at lying.

142
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,612
And you should know better than anyone.

143
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,657
You were not good. That is why I am here.

144
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,575
That is what I want to say.

145
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,373
So...

146
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,501
let's continue our conversation.

147
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,965
You want to... sleep with me.

148
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,758
Ultimately, yes.

149
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,760
Because I want to get to know you.

150
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,596
But you said sleeping does not cause
the change.

151
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,432
I did not say I did not change
after sleeping.

152
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:08,811
I change once a month, for a week,
on a relatively regular schedule.

153
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,480
Sometimes while sleeping,
sometimes right after I wake up.

154
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,648
I can't tell.

155
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,359
-With no warning?
-The warning is my feeling.

156
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:19,155
If I feel strange around that time,
that is usually when the changes happen.

157
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,075
But sometimes, it does not.
It is annoyingly sporadic.

158
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,828
Then, it is simple.

159
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,289
We just have to stay together.

160
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,417
From the morning to the night.

161
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,587
How can I trust you?

162
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,048
-What if you change your words again?
-Let's make a contract.

163
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:42,219
So that you can find out about me
before you decide to sleep with me.

164
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,226
What is this?

165
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,441
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

166
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,320
If you can't trust me, trust the contract.

167
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,991
I know well that paper is more trustworthy
than people.

168
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,037
Write the contract,
and investigate my weakness.

169
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:11,624
And then you can show me your weakness.
Would that give you confidence?

170
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,335
Wait a minute. Hold on.
I need to think.

171
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:15,961
I have done all the thinking.

172
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,963
You just need to sign here.

173
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,549
-Why are you in such a hurry?
-I don't want you to run away.

174
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,344
You tend to fly away at critical moments.

175
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,390
I think I've told you
that I don't run away for fun.

176
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:31,894
I will not run away.

177
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,480
Good, then.

178
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:39,735
Then, shall we write
"No running away" first?

179
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:41,821
One.

180
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,616
No running away.

181
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:52,122
Two. Secrets shall be kept no matter what.

182
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,336
Having said that,
please change my name on your phone.

183
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:58,671
Also your password.

184
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,758
Isn't 1004 too classic?

185
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,052
Why? It is easy to remember.

186
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,555
Also I am like an angel, too.

187
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,224
It is easy for other people, too.

188
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:14,728
Change it to something that is not related
to angelic Han Se-gye.

189
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,107
When's your birthday?

190
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:19,775
January 16th.

191
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,444
Good, 0116.
And it has nothing to do with me.

192
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,154
It is up to you.

193
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,075
Three. Phone calls shall be answered
within three seconds.

194
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,952
How is that possible?
I am a very busy person.

195
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,704
Do I look like I have a lot of time?

196
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,622
Lastly, Four.

197
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,875
When our business relationship ends,

198
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,002
this contract shall be destroyed.

199
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,755
About sleeping together,

200
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,967
we can decide on the details

201
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,428
after revealing all myÂ weaknesses.

202
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,685
After...

203
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,439
I earn your trust.

204
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:02,735
Why do we always work on-site?

205
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,695
I am so tired.

206
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,241
I can't go home and I get no recognition.
This is the tragedy of a salaryman.

207
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,744
Nevertheless, Han Se-gye is so pretty.

208
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,787
She is!

209
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,415
She is not that pretty.

210
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,375
Are you jealous?

211
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,795
-I understand. She is prettier than you.
-What?

212
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:25,549
Why do I have to look pretty?

213
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,928
It is good for men to be pretty, too.
You are ages behind the trend.

214
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,472
Isn't that Han Se-gye,
who is prettier than you?

215
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,557
Why does she have to be prettier than me?

216
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,267
Ha... Han Se-gye!

217
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,652
It looks like your employees came back.
Do you want to pull down the blinds?

218
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,696
I left them up on purpose.

219
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,410
Why? Because it would look suspicious?

220
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,914
What's wrong with being suspicious?

221
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,210
Is it OK to be suspicious?

222
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,045
No.

223
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,384
Then, let's end the suspicion.
Go home.

224
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,220
I will contact you to confirm
the next meeting.

225
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,514
You're telling me to leave now?

226
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:16,141
Take the document
and think it over carefully.

227
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,311
Please let me know,
hopefully before your next change.

228
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,189
Are you serious?
I am alone and I have no car.

229
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,817
After you sign, you can send it
by express delivery service,

230
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,652
since meetings look suspicious.

231
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,575
Then, good bye.

232
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,849
I look forward to good news, Han Se-gye.

233
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:24,376
My manager hasÂ ancestral rites today,
so I am so busy.

234
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,295
When was the next meeting?

235
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,422
Was it 7:00 p.m.? Or 8:00 p.m.?

236
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,637
So busy... busy.

237
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,267
She is so pretty.

238
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,354
So she came alone because
her manager had to goÂ ancestral rites.

239
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,607
Yes, that makes sense.

240
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,903
Otherwise, she would not come here
and leave alone like that.

241
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,030
She is pretty, though.

242
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,406
Prettier than you.

243
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,825
I wish I could have that face for one day.

244
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,911
She looks nice even from behind!

245
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,164
If you are done with your work, go home.

246
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,878
Even if you are not done, go home.

247
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,436
Oh, my God!

248
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,562
Yes.

249
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,940
That is how I feel everyday,

250
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,150
when I open the waiting room door,

251
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,362
when I open the van door,
and when I open the internet browser.

252
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:34,988
"Oh, my God!

253
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,616
Where did she run away?"

254
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,745
-Sorry.
-Let's terminate the management contract.

255
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,248
I cannot live like this any more.

256
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,208
Hold on a sec.

257
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,462
Before you express your frustration,

258
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,881
I request a peaceful discussion
over tteok-bokki

259
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,468
What kind? Spicy one?

260
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,021
So, you were with him until now?

261
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,524
Did he apologize?

262
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,401
Did he thank you?

263
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,153
Sort of.

264
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:15,821
By the way,

265
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:21,034
what does it mean
when a man asks to sleep together?

266
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,787
Is that something they ask for
with no special meaning?

267
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,372
That jerk asked you to sleep with him?

268
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,750
No...

269
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:34,006
I just...

270
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:39,845
was curious if that is something
that anyone can ask.

271
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,555
Good. JustÂ sleep with him.

272
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,056
What?

273
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,977
You are past the age
where you should save it for later.

274
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,854
What does age have to do with this?

275
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:49,855
It does.

276
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:53,025
When you get older,
you cannot save it anyway.

277
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:56,195
Because there will be no desire left.
Use it while you have it.

278
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,779
That is not it.

279
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,365
Pour everything in while you can.

280
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,409
Now is the time.

281
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,538
-That is not it!
-Then what?

282
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:10,542
I will take a break
and think about it for a while,

283
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,877
before I decide what to do.

284
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,130
Good idea. Make sure you take a break.

285
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,633
Do not run away again, OK?

286
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,550
Alright.

287
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,010
OK?

288
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,430
I said alright.

289
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,071
DATING WITHOUT WEDDING

290
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,326
He is not a good person.

291
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,956
Did he really... have to say that?

292
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,166
"Sleep with me!"

293
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,838
Did he really have to make my heart drop
like that?

294
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,600
One. No running away.

295
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,436
You also ran away form my questions.

296
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:16,275
Also no running away from questions.

297
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,737
Two. Secrets shall be kept no matter what.

298
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,286
It is understood
that broken secrets result in retaliation.

299
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,788
I risk my life.

300
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,207
-Retaliation is a must.
-Excuse me?

301
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,420
Oh... I am just practicing my lines.

302
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:10,954
INCORRECT PASSWORD

303
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,884
Jerk Seo Do-jae.

304
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,764
Uncle.

305
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,865
What's up with the three second rule?

306
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,284
He hasn't even been calling.

307
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,332
I answerÂ as fast as I can.

308
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,381
Calls shall be frequent.

309
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:06,968
Phone calls shall be answered actively,
when necessary,Â and cooperatively.

310
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:11,306
Four. When our business relationship ends,

311
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,266
the contract shall be destroyed.

312
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,894
Upon destruction of the contract,

313
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:19,898
every detail that was written
in the contract shall be forgotten.

314
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,327
There is a delivery for you.

315
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,287
From whom?

316
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,457
Auntie?

317
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,001
Is your auntie coming
to the family gathering?

318
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,350
Look at all these plants.

319
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:01,940
PROF. KANG DAE-SIK

320
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,233
Twenty eight!

321
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:04,860
Next.

322
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,113
The red ones...

323
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:17,956
Just as we inject viruses
to make a vaccine,

324
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,625
we inject crop protectants.

325
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,420
Eighteen and 23.

326
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,343
Time flies!

327
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,193
-Give me all of them.
-Could you please wait for a second?

328
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:50,280
No, I don't have time.
Please wrap them up and give them to her.

329
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,699
-I will be looking around upstairs.
-Yes ma'am.

330
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,345
Are you following me?

331
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,847
Not at all.
I am just handing out samples.

332
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,015
It is a new perfume.

333
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,935
Why do you keep appearing?

334
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:24,105
Strictly speaking,
you appeared at my work.

335
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,484
So I am following you?

336
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,028
It is OK. I am used to it.

337
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,406
Since you are following me, take it.

338
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,617
Enjoy your shopping!

339
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,793
This is our new perfume.

340
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,878
Try this.

341
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,713
Thank you.

342
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,466
This is our new perfume.

343
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,261
Try this. Thank you.

344
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,347
Employee training is a mess.

345
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,723
Try this please.

346
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,143
This is not even my style.

347
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:37,804
Pork belly dishes are supposed to be

348
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:42,309
shared by all family members like this.

349
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,853
Let's eat.

350
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,107
This is too luxurious.

351
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,360
-What?
-Am I wrong?

352
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,696
We could have just gone
to a neighborhood restaurant.

353
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,240
What's up with the top chefs
and assistants?

354
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:58,992
I feel this is too much.

355
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:08,251
He is just happy that the family gathered
to eat together after so long.

356
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,921
He always expresses his happiness
that way. You know that, Dad.

357
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,424
You take everything the wrong way!

358
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,512
-The food is really good, Grandpa.
-Yes!

359
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,264
Eat all you want.

360
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,895
Are you wasting her potential?

361
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,397
Look at her face. She lost so much weight!

362
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,443
I am the one who is ambitious.
It is not mother's fault.

363
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:41,409
Prof. Kang raised these. Try some.

364
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,662
Is that so?

365
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:49,751
Not bad.

366
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,504
It is worth the money.

367
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,841
Is it from that Smart Farm?

368
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,135
The one that I sponsored?

369
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:02,806
Yes. Thanks to you,
the students are doing experiments.

370
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,600
It is all because of you, Chairman.

371
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,478
You called me "Chairman" again.

372
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:12,065
When are you going to see me
as your father-in-law?

373
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,235
After all that money,
you still don't call me father-in-law?

374
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,781
That's just how he is.

375
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,157
Isn't that why you like him?

376
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:24,536
I want him to call me father
because I like him.

377
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,998
What happened between you and that model?

378
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,670
Why do you always talk about the model?

379
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:37,132
Then, what else would I talk about?

380
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,175
Then should I talk about business?

381
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:42,846
With someone who cannot even handle
one VIP at the takeoff ceremony?

382
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,641
Did you think I would not know?

383
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,603
If it wasn't for that model,

384
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,356
you must have been embarrassed so much.

385
00:28:55,442 --> 00:29:00,488
Did you know that T-Road contracted
with Dasi Tour to share mileage?

386
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,991
Do-jae worked hard.

387
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,868
Did he? Really?

388
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,829
If he couldn't get it done,
I am sure Sa-ra would have.

389
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,833
Does Oneair have
planes big enough to fly there?

390
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,967
I was about to say this later,
but since we are on the topic,

391
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:25,555
we recently won a plane
worth 50 billion won at the auction

392
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:26,723
at half price.

393
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,308
Look at her!

394
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:33,646
-She is good at saving.
-What about the airworthiness certificate?

395
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,399
AIRWORTHINESS CERTIFICATE: TEST
FOR SAFETY AND RELIABILITY FOR FLIGHT

396
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:40,612
We got it. On the first try.
It was fit, just like Grandpa.

397
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:42,906
What about slots?

398
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,449
SLOT: TAKE OFF AND LADING CAPACITY.

399
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,284
I would like to take some from T-Road.

400
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,704
I cannot make flights
to vacation destinations at dawn.

401
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,916
Of course.
It is hard to fill planes that early.

402
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,377
That hurts my feelings.

403
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,546
Our pilots are real veterans.

404
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,631
No doubt.

405
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,883
You scouted them from my team.

406
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:05,970
I was not worried about the pilots.
I was talking about the service area.

407
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,266
He worries about me so much.

408
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:12,811
Thank you, Brother.

409
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,313
No, thank you.

410
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,191
You taught me the joy of giving,

411
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:21,319
as I always have to give to Oneair.

412
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,288
Now that you mention the joy of giving...

413
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,297
This is for Grandpa.

414
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,008
This is for Mother.

415
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,135
And this is for you, Dad.

416
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,931
I am practicing giving, too.

417
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,060
You didn't have to do this.

418
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,854
-Thank you.
-And...

419
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,653
This is for you.

420
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:09,450
Since you like fish.

421
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,871
Don't kill it.

422
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:22,755
Since I have eaten, received a present,
and talked,

423
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,508
-I will go now.
-Already?

424
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,176
It will die soon like this.

425
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,137
She said not to kill it.

426
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:33,308
On your way out,
take one of those cars over there.

427
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,145
I haven't ridden in the last one
even ten times.

428
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,564
You bought extra cars, just for fun again?

429
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:43,610
The sales person was sweet.

430
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,862
How could I buy just one?

431
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,113
I had to save face.

432
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:49,657
What is all the money for?
You are just wasting itÂ like this.

433
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,952
How dare you?

434
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:57,248
Just go! You've ruined my appetite.

435
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,712
Leave him alone.
My dad changes his mind all the time.

436
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,591
I will go for a walk while I say good bye.

437
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,134
I am so full.

438
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,720
Would you like to walk with me, Son?

439
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,154
Did you really have to do that?

440
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,281
-What?
-Did you really...

441
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:33,993
Never mind. Just eat.

442
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,372
Why?

443
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:41,876
You don't want to see me be unruly
in someone else's family?

444
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:44,879
Kang Sa-ra!

445
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,799
You are happy that you live
with a woman you love.

446
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,175
It has been ten years

447
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:52,053
since I joined this house for you
when you got married.

448
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,269
In a family of strangers,

449
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,189
this is how I try to belong.

450
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,441
So just leave me alone.

451
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,820
Sa-ra.

452
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,864
Family is not about

453
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:16,119
winning and being recognized.

454
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,037
Then, I may not be their family.

455
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,377
Was it fun?

456
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,879
Of course it was.

457
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:31,426
It's been a while
since I saw you trying not  to lose.

458
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:36,764
Both Grandfather
and you have strange taste.

459
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:40,226
I try every day. You just don't know it.

460
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,021
Why don't I know?

461
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:47,108
Hang in there. Be patient.

462
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,821
Are you happy with your new husband?

463
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,034
I am.

464
00:33:56,534 --> 00:34:02,040
Your dad was too busy loving his pottery
and statues, not me.

465
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:08,129
He gave his favorite vase to you, not me.

466
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,841
Your father failed as a husband.

467
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,719
He failed as a father, too.

468
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:20,183
He tried to pay back his guilt
of not being a good dad with a vase.

469
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:24,395
Why did it have to be a Joseon white vase?

470
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:49,420
Entertainment Inside invited the top star
Han Se-gye here.

471
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,047
Hello, Han Se-gye!

472
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:51,964
Hi!

473
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,966
Can you please say a word for theÂ viewers?

474
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,637
I've always wanted to share
the love I've been given.

475
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:01,599
I am glad that I was able to this time.

476
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,601
For the fans,

477
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:07,563
they will be happy to find out
what your next film will be.

478
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:11,734
Do you have any plan
to share the excitement?

479
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,695
I am waiting for a good one.

480
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,532
The rumor says

481
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:21,035
you are cast in a movie by Lee Hui-seop
who is resuming directing after ten years.

482
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,286
Is that true?

483
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:23,830
Pardon?

484
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:26,415
You debuted in Lee's movie "Ok-jeong"

485
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,960
and have been called
a persona of Director Lee.

486
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,711
That is how you got the spotlight.

487
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:34,423
You must feel emotional to star
in his movie again after ten years.

488
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,008
Well... yes.

489
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:40,221
We look forward to the film
made by a top star and a top director.

490
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,430
Thank you.

491
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:48,771
-Good job.
-Thank you.

492
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:55,027
-Did the director come back?
-Huh?

493
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,362
Yes.

494
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,364
Why did you not tell me?

495
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,741
Because it is better for you not to know.

496
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:02,827
Call him.

497
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:06,539
Se-gye, there are lots of other films.

498
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,957
Call him, please.

499
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:13,713
I did. He said he doesn't want to see you.

500
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:24,307
What's the point of putting it there?
It is so distinctive.

501
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,268
Sa-ra gave it to me.

502
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,773
Did you make sure it's not carrying
a bomb or a microphone?

503
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,817
Unfortunately, I could not.

504
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,780
Just curious. If something goes wrong,
will the company pay for it?

505
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,199
No.

506
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,994
So don't think something bad will happen.

507
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,250
What will you name him?

508
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,127
Not sure.

509
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,356
I should have put a mic on the fish.

510
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:18,736
-Is Kang Sa-ra in there?
-You cannot just go in.

511
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:22,365
-There is a deliver for you, Kang Sa-ra.
-Wait, just give it to me.

512
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,824
I will hand it to her.

513
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,744
No, it says it has be delivered
to her directly.

514
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,414
I am Kang Sa-ra.

515
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,540
That is mine.

516
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,335
-Can I see your ID please?
-Oh...

517
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,464
-Well...
-ID please.

518
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,676
You cannot just barge in.

519
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,135
I am sorry.

520
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,391
I am sorry.

521
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,017
Why are you here?

522
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:53,729
I was told
to hand it over to you personally.

523
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:59,527
Giving it to my secretary is
the same as giving it to me.

524
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:03,239
I am not sure if you are inflexible
or if you are good at your job.

525
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,576
-Leave it there.
-After I see your ID.

526
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:13,374
In order to receive this,
you have to present your ID first,

527
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,042
according to the procedure.

528
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,803
Here. Now leave it and go.

529
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,225
You are older than me.

530
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,530
Are you actually following me?

531
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:50,202
It might look like that,
but this is a simple coincidence.

532
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,206
Please sign here.

533
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,058
Then, bye.

534
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,735
He does everything.

535
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,196
He must be so busy.

536
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:39,251
-Are you on strike?
-Something like that.

537
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:46,675
What's this?

538
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:48,761
DIRECTOR: LEE HUI-SEOP

539
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:51,055
-What's this?
-It is a script.

540
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,307
Where did you get it?
You said he wasn't answering calls.

541
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,392
I stole it.

542
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:58,354
You are the best!

543
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,357
Chae Yu-ri will play the role, I heard.

544
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,859
There will be a better film.

545
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,865
Where is he?

546
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,701
I heard he will leave soon
to finish the scenario.

547
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,372
He is the one
who helped me begin this career.

548
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,250
You know what that means to me.

549
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,835
There will be another chance.

550
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,712
He directs once in ten years.
When will I have another chance?

551
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,174
I don't know what will happen to me.

552
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,846
Hold on. Wait, please.

553
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:36,434
You can't just come in without
an appointment. He is in a meeting.

554
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,269
Don't you know me? I am Han Se-gye.

555
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,521
Director Lee!

556
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,983
I am here. Han Se-gye is here.

557
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,905
Hello!

558
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:58,706
I think she came here
to have a word with you. Should I leave?

559
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,666
No, stay here.

560
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,377
It is OK.

561
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,006
Say what you want, please.

562
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:12,553
Director Lee.

563
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:16,348
You came back to Korea.
Why did you not call me?

564
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,727
If I don't call you

565
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,604
or answer your calls,

566
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,148
wouldn't there be a reason?

567
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,527
I am Se-gye. Why are you speaking
in such a formal tone?

568
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,739
Maybe I overdressed.

569
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,950
I just wanted to look nice,
since I hadn't seen you in so long.

570
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:36,702
We don't know each other.

571
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:41,624
The actress that I knew does not seem
to exist anymore.

572
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,420
She has changed too much.

573
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,592
Do you really have to create
this uncomfortable situation?

574
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,844
What is this, when I have a guest here?

575
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,598
You think it's OK
because you are Han Se-gye?

576
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,604
I am sorry. I was in a hurry.

577
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,025
I was afraid if you left the country,
I would lose this opportunity.

578
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:13,197
What is this nonsense?
There is no opportunity for you anyway.

579
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,450
If you are done, leave.

580
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:24,083
Now you don't even listen?

581
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:25,501
Why?

582
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:29,046
I thought you liked to be told to leave.

583
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:35,177
Or is it only when you want to?

584
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:40,224
Do whatever you want.
You can stay there or leave.

585
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,687
You are too big a star
for a humble director like me.

586
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,327
I am sorry.

587
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:03,581
Yes, Director.

588
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,834
I know I've changed. But I...

589
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,717
I did not change because I wanted to.

590
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,387
Your acting has improved.

591
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:22,266
Please give me a chance.

592
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:23,976
Trust me just once.

593
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,645
No one can do it better than me.

594
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,607
I don't agree.

595
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,734
I will do my best.

596
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,277
I will do well.

597
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,905
You know me. You know me best.

598
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,201
I used to think I did.

599
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,457
Your film will screen soon, right?

600
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,710
I asked you come during
your busy schedule. Sorry about this.

601
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:50,878
Where were we?

602
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:55,257
I think the character's love can...

603
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:59,219
be added to this part.

604
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,388
Get up. Let's go.

605
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:17,571
This is my profile.

606
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,239
Please take this.

607
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:39,927
Take it away.

608
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,812
I shouldn't have taken you there.

609
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:55,943
I should have dragged you
away from the gate.

610
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,361
It's fine.

611
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,655
This must be uncomfortable.

612
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:02,199
Go home and drink.
I will set up the big table for you.

613
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:04,743
I want to drink on the street tonight.

614
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,497
I was so pathetic today.

615
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,878
Just let me do what I want.

616
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:16,964
Fine.

617
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,845
He said I've changed too much.

618
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,765
Everyone says I've changed.

619
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:38,986
In the past, I used to think
people just didn't know me.

620
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,865
But today, it came to me.

621
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:48,829
Maybe

622
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:53,125
the person they think I am is the real me.

623
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:57,963
Maybe I should be.

624
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,716
Stop thinking like that.

625
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,010
Why do you care what other people think?

626
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:04,803
I should care, of course.

627
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,431
My jobs is to appear in front of people.

628
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,350
Then, I will advise you as a stranger.

629
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:15,272
To me, you are same. Nothing has changed.

630
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,028
That was cool.

631
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:23,989
It is all good.

632
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:27,242
Drink and forget about it.
Is that the only movie in the world?

633
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:31,246
That is right. Is that the only one?
The script wasn't even that good.

634
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,166
I just wanted to do it
because they would not let me.

635
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:38,754
I really think so.

636
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:42,216
To be honest,
I think that movie will flop.

637
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,180
Raise your glass.

638
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:50,182
Flop!

639
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:52,810
Flop!

640
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,604
Lord, please forgive me.

641
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,233
-Flop!
-Flop!

642
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,239
-Let's drink a little more.
-Are you going to buy?

643
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,282
I feel good, so I will pay.

644
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:09,076
Sit down.

645
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,745
Hello, here!

646
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,414
Pork cartilage and three sojus please!

647
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,582
Which soju?

648
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,084
Han Se-gye orÂ Chae Yu-ri?

649
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,378
Pick the prettier one.

650
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,464
-Chae Yu-ri!
-Chae Yu-ri?

651
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:26,718
I told you to pick the prettier one.

652
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,720
You don't know anything
about pretty faces.

653
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,347
That's why you are alone.

654
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:35,102
I heard Han Se-gye donated 100 million won
to help underprivileged youth.

655
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:40,023
She has a pretty face
as well as a pretty heart!

656
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,902
R...right. That's right.

657
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:46,280
That is the real beauty.

658
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:51,118
See? Han Se-gye is prettier.

659
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:54,371
She is pretty inside and out.
And she is rich.

660
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:56,748
Which one is your pick? Hurry.

661
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,793
We will go with Han Se-gye.

662
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,461
Han Se-gye! Yes!

663
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:04,923
I will buy eel for that table,

664
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,925
because I am drunk!

665
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,143
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

666
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,316
AUNTIE

667
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,451
Phone calls shall be answered
as quickly as possible.

668
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:38,415
Hello.

669
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,213
Is she that pretty?

670
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:47,841
Is she that much better an actress
than me?

671
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,969
Why is it her, not me?

672
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:55,307
I really wanted to do it!

673
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:58,435
Really, really!

674
00:48:58,644 --> 00:48:59,728
Han Se-gye?

675
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,397
The movie is not going to flop.

676
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:05,901
What do you think?

677
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,153
How would I know?

678
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:12,950
I knew it.
I knew you would think that way!

679
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:15,702
It will go to the Cannes.

680
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,080
Cannes...

681
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:22,542
I've always wanted to go the Cannes.

682
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,086
Are you drunk?

683
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,673
The title of the movie is "Six."

684
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,217
You know about clones, right?

685
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,804
It is about six clones

686
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:36,473
who live their own lives.

687
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:40,852
I can act really well.

688
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:43,772
That is something only I can do!

689
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:49,444
I am right. Look.

690
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:50,988
No, you don't have to...

691
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,169
Sit.

692
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:12,551
Darling, I cannot live
in this cruel house.

693
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,886
I'll have to leave.

694
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:19,307
You don't speak today either.

695
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,518
You are a heartbreaker!

696
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:29,526
Guns work for those who don't speak.

697
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:35,657
When I aim,
they open their mouth asking for mercy.

698
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,743
It is a boring repertoire.

699
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:45,834
How was it?

700
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:50,172
Wow, it is surprising! Can I hang up now?

701
00:50:57,054 --> 00:51:00,390
The director was surprised like you were
when he first saw me.

702
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:06,396
I began my acting career with his film.

703
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,190
He is...

704
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:14,821
like a mom who gave birth to me.

705
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,157
I don't know why I have to listen to this.

706
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,117
I haven't had a dad

707
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,872
since I was born.

708
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:30,253
My mom gave birth to me alone at 18.

709
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:32,464
Her life was... tough.

710
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:34,633
That is not my point.

711
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:38,095
Anyway, the director is like my dad.

712
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:42,057
I am where I am because of him.

713
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,020
So I feel...

714
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:52,109
like I've been abandoned by my dad.

715
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:59,241
You know how it feels?

716
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:03,995
Do you?

717
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,040
I do.

718
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:11,711
What do you know?

719
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:15,549
Are you crying?

720
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:20,011
Don't you think I am great at crying?
I got you, right?

721
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:23,849
-I'm hanging up.
-Wait!

722
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,738
You are a heartbreaker.

723
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,035
Heartbreaker....

724
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:29,456
Do me a favor?

725
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:32,125
Yes, I got it.

726
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:39,049
Do you have to serve
the Headquarters Director again?

727
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:41,593
That is what a salaryman does.

728
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,471
Aren't you getting paid too little
given your loyalty?

729
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:47,140
Will you ever be able to buy
a house in Seoul?

730
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,310
You wanted to buy a house, a big one.

731
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:54,522
If I save, I will, someday.

732
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:58,193
Instead of someday, you could buy one now.

733
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,657
What do you think of Oneair?

734
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:06,993
What do I think?
It is just a sister company to me.

735
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,037
Not a competitor?

736
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:12,499
Oneair has about 14 slots per hour.

737
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:15,210
It is too small to be called a competitor.

738
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:18,296
How do you make a profit
with such a small number of flights?

739
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:22,008
You speak so nicely.

740
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,554
Only capable people can play
hard like you.

741
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,849
I like a capable and hard-playing people.

742
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,395
I am so introverted
that I do not like to change environments.

743
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:36,481
-Then, why did you come here?
-You said you would buy me breakfast.

744
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:39,359
I came here to get free food
from my school senior.

745
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,904
But it was pretty big for breakfast.

746
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,781
-You, Jeong Joo-hwan!
-You are scaring me.

747
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,700
I am so scared that I will leave now.

748
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:56,126
That fish reminds me...

749
00:54:57,168 --> 00:55:00,171
You didn't plant a mic on the fish,
did you?

750
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:05,093
-I should have.
-Why didn't you?

751
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,971
With that spirit,
you could have recruited me.

752
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:10,932
Why him?

753
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:15,103
As kids don't choose their parents,
subordinates don't choose their bosses.

754
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:17,355
So I am letting you to choose.

755
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:22,152
Just leave.

756
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:26,156
This was the first breakfast
I had in a month. It was good.

757
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:51,097
It will go to the Cannes!

758
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:54,642
Cannes!

759
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:56,728
You don't speak today either.

760
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,189
You are a heartbreaker.

761
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:04,569
Guns work for those who don't speak.

762
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:11,576
I am just a dog.

763
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,161
Dog.

764
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,374
Han Se-gae.

765
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:30,053
Store D on the third floor
of Royal Department Store at 3:00 p.m.

766
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:31,721
Don't forget your passport.

767
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,437
What is this all of a sudden?

768
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:46,486
"Phone calls shall be answered actively
and cooperatively."

769
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:49,364
This is what you wrote, Auntie!

770
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:00,875
You know, people make mistakes.

771
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:04,254
Why do you ask me to come
right after I drank?

772
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:06,172
I did not even get to eat hangover soup.

773
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:08,842
People make mistakes.

774
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,845
But you were not a human last night.

775
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:19,060
You are not
so much of a human today either.

776
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:20,979
Did you throw up?

777
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:23,314
No, not yet.

778
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:26,276
The store is not busy.
It is perfect for someone to throw up.

779
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:29,404
-Maybe because it is a weekday?
-I asked them to clear the store.

780
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:41,958
I don't look my best,
but people still recognize me.

781
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,502
The life of a star!

782
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:49,466
Mr. Director!

783
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:52,343
Thank you for visiting our store.

784
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:54,971
Sure.

785
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:59,517
This, this, this, and this.

786
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:03,563
And from here to there.

787
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:07,817
Send them all.
The new lines this season are all good.

788
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,737
Yes, I will prepare right away
and send them to your home.

789
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:12,155
I would also like to...

790
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:18,077
buy from here to here.

791
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:22,999
You are...

792
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,960
You are right. I am Han Se-gye.

793
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:28,463
Don't feel burdened, though.

794
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:33,384
-Not that. Have you made an appointment?
-An appointment?

795
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:37,805
A lot of people reserve
the new clothing lines for women.

796
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:40,558
If you don't have an appointment,
you can make one.

797
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:42,060
Then, we will sell one by one.

798
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:47,357
The designer for this brand presented
clothes to me directly.

799
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:51,945
Good for you.

800
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,532
Would you like to make an appointment?

801
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,201
I don't think she will have time for that.

802
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:01,287
If you don't mind,
can you proceed with my order first?

803
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:04,624
Yes, sir. I will do that.

804
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:11,130
Why do you decide if I have time or not?

805
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,559
What is...?

806
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,312
You might be only a little late,
if you leave now.

807
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:29,732
It is not my fault. You arrived late.

808
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,571
This is the flight
that Director Lee will be on.

809
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:37,699
Fortunately, he flies with T-Road.

810
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,660
There is no hidden meaning in this.

811
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:44,956
Your success is also good for T-Road.

812
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,894
Please take me to the airport
as fast as you can.

813
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:08,521
My life depends on this.

814
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,035
Are you Mr. Lee Hui-seop?

815
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:24,495
-Yes.
-Your seat has been upgraded.

816
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,040
Come this way, please.

817
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:34,881
You can sit anywhere you want.

818
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:37,550
-OK.
-Have a wonderful flight.

819
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,993
Did you follow me here?

820
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:08,081
Strictly speaking, I was here before you.

821
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,794
Now you talked to me casually.

822
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:17,382
You will change nothing by doing this.

823
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:20,885
-Did you see my profile?
-I threw it away.

824
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,639
It must be mixed in
with other applicants' profiles.

825
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:29,102
Good, that is where I want it to be.

826
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:32,230
That applicant,

827
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,482
the Han Se-gye
you met for the first time...

828
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:38,403
is still me. I have not changed.

829
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:43,116
No. Unfortunately, you have changed.

830
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:47,120
I was told you've changed.

831
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:53,543
Then,
why don't you think during the flight

832
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:56,421
and decide if I have changed
and how I have changed.

833
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:04,095
If you cannot trust me, trust yourself.

834
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:09,350
I am the actress that you made.

835
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:13,646
If I made you like this,

836
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:15,273
I should admit

837
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,568
I am disappointed in myself.

838
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,569
Oh my goodness, who is this?

839
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:04,280
Aren't you Han Se-gye?
Did you run awayÂ again?

840
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:09,952
No, I am here to catch
a friend who ran away.

841
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,538
-Did you catch him?
-No, I lost him.

842
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:16,626
Other people run away
because you run away all the time.

843
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:20,213
I guess so.

844
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:22,965
You look so down.

845
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:26,219
Cheer up. Just don't run away next time.

846
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:29,388
-You are pretty.
-I am your fan.

847
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,140
-Me, too.
-I am your fan, too.

848
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:32,517
Me, too!

849
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,772
I think I will run away next time, too.

850
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:40,149
I can't help it.

851
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:04,048
Hello?

852
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:06,926
We are calling to offer a prize
to our valued customers

853
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:09,178
where you can loan
up to 10,000,000 won.

854
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:11,347
I already have plenty of money.

855
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:14,976
You sound like a young lady.
Why don't you--

856
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:17,311
I am young and rich, OK?

857
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:18,479
Please wait--

858
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:34,287
-I said I have plenty of money.
-I know.

859
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:37,248
How?

860
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,417
You made a donation before.

861
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:46,883
Who is this?

862
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:50,428
The guy who does laundry, serves coffee,
sells perfume, and makes deliveries.

863
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:54,849
-How did you find my number?
-It was written on the delivery slip.

864
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:57,602
Do you think it's OK
to get my number that way?

865
01:04:57,685 --> 01:05:01,272
I know I shouldn't, but I was desperate.

866
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:02,607
I am sorry.

867
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:06,444
Your desperation has
nothing to do with me. Bye.

868
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:07,820
Hold on!

869
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:14,201
He acts cute!

870
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,544
Why hasn't anyone invented
a make-up removing machine?

871
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,671
I've been rejected.

872
01:05:26,213 --> 01:05:27,757
-By who?
-By someone rich.

873
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,134
I thought that was a girl.

874
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:31,469
It is a girl.

875
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:39,352
-Really?
-She makes donations and does good things.

876
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:42,104
There was this group who needed money
so desperately.

877
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:44,523
Sure.

878
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:47,109
That was why you called.

879
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:49,695
"You?" You don't call me "big brother"?

880
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:51,072
Whatever.

881
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:54,825
-You are not even listening.
-You son of...

882
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:09,590
Get in before someone sees you.

883
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,067
That was surprising.

884
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:30,152
How did you know it was me?

885
01:06:30,444 --> 01:06:32,446
By looking at your clothes and your walk.

886
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:34,573
How was the meeting?

887
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,451
I think it was not meant for me.

888
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:42,206
But I feel alright,
as I did everything I could.

889
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:46,210
Thank you for helping me do that.

890
01:06:46,293 --> 01:06:49,463
No need. You owe me for this.

891
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:53,467
You just can't be nice.
You have to mention debt.

892
01:06:57,555 --> 01:07:00,558
The contract is concluded.
Review and sign it, please.

893
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:05,062
This is why I came.

894
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:07,398
Of course.

895
01:07:15,781 --> 01:07:18,159
Why do youÂ keep acting

896
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:20,286
with that special condition?

897
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:24,290
Is this subject to the first clause
in the agreement?

898
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:26,792
"Questions shall be answered

899
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:29,003
without running away."

900
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:29,962
It could be.

901
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:33,090
OK. Let's say it is.

902
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:38,095
I am doing it so that I don't forget.

903
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:40,222
So that I don't forget about myself.

904
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:45,519
Someday... I feel like I will forget
everything about myself.

905
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,277
Is it my turn?

906
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:58,282
Hold on. Can you stop there?

907
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:10,878
According to my research,

908
01:08:10,961 --> 01:08:14,006
watching a movie seems difficult
for those with prosopagnosia.

909
01:08:14,965 --> 01:08:15,800
So,

910
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:20,012
we can check if what you say is true
or not while we are here.

911
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:23,182
Do you really have to check
in the daytime, on a weekday?

912
01:08:23,557 --> 01:08:24,809
Isn't that too reckless?

913
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:26,727
You don't know.

914
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:29,939
Daytime during the weekday is
the safest time. There are fewer people.

915
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:33,984
During the daytime on a weekday,
when there are not many people,

916
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:35,402
why a Chae Yu-ri movie?

917
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:40,032
As you paid for the plane tickets,
I will pay for the movie tickets.

918
01:08:53,754 --> 01:08:54,755
See?

919
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:56,173
I told you.

920
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:10,104
Are you looking for something?
May I help you?

921
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:17,153
Yes.

922
01:09:21,365 --> 01:09:22,533
May I help you?

923
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,577
Am I not better than her?

924
01:09:27,913 --> 01:09:29,081
Can you not tell?

925
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:32,793
I can tell the difference.

926
01:09:33,919 --> 01:09:34,753
You can?

927
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:40,718
Are you sleeping?

928
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:44,221
If people change theirÂ hair and clothes,

929
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:47,016
they look the same to me.

930
01:09:48,475 --> 01:09:52,396
It is better not to look,
because it is easier to just listen.

931
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:53,856
Sushi?

932
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:57,610
Good. I like sushi, too.

933
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:59,028
That is unfortunate.

934
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:01,197
I have to count the inventory today...

935
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,489
You are better.

936
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:07,953
It is dinner time.

937
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:09,705
Say that one more time, please?

938
01:10:10,414 --> 01:10:11,874
You are better.

939
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:14,335
Why?

940
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:17,588
You are the only actress...

941
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:20,466
I can recognize.

942
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:46,909
This is very difficult.

943
01:10:49,995 --> 01:10:51,580
You were honest.

944
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:56,210
You are sick,

945
01:10:57,795 --> 01:10:59,088
just like me.

946
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:11,850
Thank you for the thought.
Have a good meal.

947
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:13,602
Wa..wait.

948
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:21,485
Are you sleeping?

949
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:29,910
I guess the trip wore me out.

950
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:31,912
I am sorry.

951
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:37,710
Thank you.

952
01:11:39,086 --> 01:11:41,088
I will pay you back for this, too,

953
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:42,965
no matter what.

954
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:49,972
Please wake me up when it's over.

955
01:11:52,057 --> 01:11:54,351
She is so bad at acting
that I cannot watch.

956
01:12:16,915 --> 01:12:18,208
To tell the truth,

957
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:21,545
I did a lot of practice before coming
here today,

958
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:24,673
to have a meal with you...

959
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:31,638
Why does it have to be today?

960
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:40,564
It was a good ending, right?

961
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:42,358
You didn't even watch.

962
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:57,373
There is Han Se-gye!

963
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:03,504
-That is Han Se-gye.
-She is here.

964
01:13:03,587 --> 01:13:06,882
-Isn't that the man, Seo Do-jae?
-Hurry!

965
01:13:07,007 --> 01:13:10,302
-It is him!
-Why are they coming out together?

966
01:13:14,014 --> 01:13:17,226
Are you following cameras
or are cameras following you?

967
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:19,228
I don't know the answer.

968
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:23,774
But standing in front of a camera seems
to be your destiny.

969
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:27,027
Do you know what to do?

970
01:13:40,624 --> 01:13:43,794
-It is her.
-Han Se-gye, can you say a word?

971
01:13:43,877 --> 01:13:47,589
-It was true.
-Are you admitting the relationship?

972
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:53,345
Smile...

973
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:03,355
as if you are happy.

974
01:14:37,764 --> 01:14:41,685
-Why did you say something like that?
-Let's be the couple of theÂ century.

975
01:14:41,768 --> 01:14:45,439
Did the director not give you a role
even after youÂ knelt down?

976
01:14:46,106 --> 01:14:48,609
You will only be his weakness.

977
01:14:48,692 --> 01:14:50,360
Please leave my son immediately.

978
01:14:50,694 --> 01:14:52,279
-Are you crying?
-Don't move.

979
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:55,157
You might not have recognized me.
That is why.

980
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:57,534
"Questions shall be answered
without running away."

981
01:14:58,202 --> 01:14:59,828
Let me ask you one thing.

982
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:01,914
It is a bit late to ask now...

983
01:15:03,123 --> 01:15:04,625
but do you have a boyfriend?

984
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:10,756
