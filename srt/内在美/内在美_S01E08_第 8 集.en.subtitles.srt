1
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,312
I closed my eyes for just a short time,
and when I opened them...

2
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,034
Can you hear me?
Give me something now.

3
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,329
...the world had changed.

4
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,248
Oh, Do-jae.

5
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,671
Who... are you?

6
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,579
In the blink of an eye, I realized...

7
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,260
I'm sorry.

8
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,677
...it was not the world that had changed,

9
00:02:58,636 --> 00:02:59,470
I had.

10
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,453
Number one.

11
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,208
Number two.

12
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,006
Number three.

13
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:42,680
Try again.

14
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:47,602
Again.

15
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,108
It took a very long time...

16
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:57,862
One... two... three...

17
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,950
four... five...

18
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,453
six.

19
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,208
Number seven.

20
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,669
Try again.

21
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,130
12.

22
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,845
For the first time,
you got them all correct.

23
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,518
...until I could recognize
the things I love.

24
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:04,053
Hairstyle, clothes,

25
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,764
walk, smell...

26
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,016
Mother.

27
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,976
speech, and habit.

28
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:12,812
I'm back.

29
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,732
When I started to recognize you,
the one I love,

30
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,859
using all those things,

31
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:18,818
You're back.

32
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,155
the last person I could not recognize...

33
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,329
was me.

34
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,257
Maybe it was from that moment.

35
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,635
Among the ones I can recognize,
that I must recognize,

36
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,929
and the ones I love,

37
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,267
the fact that I was not included...

38
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,109
EPISODE 8

39
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,072
I have't loved myself since that day.

40
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:05,907
Not even once.

41
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,201
I am not sure

42
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,203
if it's alright

43
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:12,830
for a person like me

44
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,167
to love you and myself.

45
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,419
Will you be OK

46
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:20,797
with me?

47
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:24,926
Do you mean it?

48
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,220
I do.

49
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:29,639
I can't believe it.

50
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,102
Prove it.

51
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:46,883
You like me?

52
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:48,801
Yes.

53
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,095
Even if I'm not beautiful?

54
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,097
Even so.

55
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,058
Thank you.

56
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,021
For liking me.

57
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,318
For liking me,

58
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,905
even though I am like this.

59
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,623
What should we do about the contract?

60
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,545
There is no such thing any more.

61
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,299
I ripped it up.

62
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:38,226
So I am the only one who has the contract.

63
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:40,811
I feel nervous.

64
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,987
We broke up.

65
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,614
But we are dating.

66
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,200
We decided to date.

67
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,787
But the media will say we broke up.

68
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,171
HAN SE-GYE AND SEO DO-JAE ARE FRIENDS

69
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,807
It happened to be that way.

70
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,856
Do it one at a time.

71
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:27,483
One!

72
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,196
Is that why poured the drink for yourself?

73
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,657
Is that why you didn't eat?

74
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,784
No. Never.

75
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,369
He made you get drunk.

76
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,913
He made you suffer so much
that you couldn't eat.

77
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,291
I won't accept this relationship.

78
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,627
It was because of work.
It was all because of work.

79
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,713
It was all because of Chae Yu-ri.

80
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,047
Next...

81
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,675
is a more important problem than that.

82
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:53,884
Answer directly.

83
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,220
Did you...

84
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,015
confess your feelings?

85
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,434
No.

86
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,437
He did. I refused.

87
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,231
I told him I will quit, but Seo Do-jae...

88
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,899
That is good, then.

89
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,735
U-mi.

90
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,738
I'm really sorry.

91
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:22,705
Reporter Park,
I have a good report for you.

92
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,212
Look at that. They already broke up.

93
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,297
Already?

94
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,966
Because of busy schedule?

95
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,718
Why did they bother in the beginning?

96
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,803
Because of personality difference?

97
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,347
They broke up to focus more on work.

98
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,974
-Now?
-Maybe she ran way again.

99
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,726
HAN SE-GYE AND SEO DO-JAE SEPARATING?

100
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:45,561
Did you see it?

101
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,231
The director
and Han Se-gye are separating.

102
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,777
Han Se-gye and Seo Do-jae's separation
from couple to friends.

103
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,321
Han Se-gye's side confirmed
the separation.

104
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,825
The reason for the separation is
to focus on her work.

105
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,921
I told you the news will be out soon.

106
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,839
I heard this from my informant,

107
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,966
which surprised me a lot.

108
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,428
How can I respect

109
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,931
the owner family?

110
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,100
What do you think, President Kang?

111
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,772
I am sure you did not call me
to post malicious comments together.

112
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,274
I heard you got very upset
at President Kim.

113
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,278
You are a woman of determination.

114
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,114
Amazing! Great!

115
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:44,161
President Kim was such a cheap shot,
unlike how he looks.

116
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,833
I am sure you didn't call me
to praise me either.

117
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:56,966
Let's gamble.

118
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,678
I am good at gambling.

119
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,973
My bet is not on Seo Do-jae,

120
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,560
but on you. What do you think?

121
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,939
You have a big dream.

122
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,651
Gambling only works when the players have
a similar amount of betting money.

123
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,194
What?

124
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,781
Your crappy cards
and bluffing will not work.

125
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:25,703
Most of all,
you are not holding good cards.

126
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,419
How dare you choose me?
Know where you stand.

127
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,171
The Chairman is

128
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,798
a stylish person.

129
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,759
However, he will not give the company

130
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,094
to his step-granddaughter
instead of his grandson.

131
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:47,349
Do you really think I wouldn't know that?

132
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,895
Are you being this bold because of him?

133
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,940
He has not come back to Korea yet, right?

134
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,527
Rumor has it he is having a good time.

135
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,660
You said he was love crazy!

136
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,123
Even crazy love ends.

137
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,958
I guess he is crazy.

138
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,211
I told you to keep your eye on him.

139
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,755
He will be in the society section
of the newspapers.

140
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,090
I will do my best to prevent that.

141
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,343
You say that.

142
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:23,928
Saying it is easy.

143
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,764
Solve this now, unless you want
a smaller salary.

144
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,516
Excuse me?

145
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,772
Salary reduction!

146
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,567
How are you?

147
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,111
Not well!

148
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,239
Why did you make such a press release?

149
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,241
Our director got dumped?

150
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,784
Does it make sense?

151
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:47,993
Why not?

152
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,371
That is what our Se-gye said.

153
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,206
She dumped him.

154
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,626
Considering it's not a real relationship,

155
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,420
we took a lot of risks already.

156
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,923
How much more should we concede?

157
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,553
Maybe you don't understand
what "taking a risk" means.

158
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,929
No, I don't.

159
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,974
Maybe it's office jargon.

160
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,559
I wouldn't know

161
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,019
as I am cut out for on-site work.

162
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,939
Do you think we will be the only ones
who get a blow?

163
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,191
Your side will also be hit hard.

164
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,442
That is what I am saying.

165
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,778
Both of us will be hit,

166
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,613
and we want to get hit a little less.

167
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,578
I cannot have a conversation with someone
who is so low.

168
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,204
Do you understand now

169
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,331
how low you guys were?

170
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:40,504
If you realized how low you were,
you wouldn't do this to me,

171
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,757
but talk to your director first.

172
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:49,889
Thanks for lunch.

173
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,984
My son is creating all kinds of trouble!

174
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,949
Darling, that is not a weed.

175
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,910
A plant that looks like a weed
has to be pulled.

176
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,245
You shouldn't do that!

177
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,290
It's hurt already.

178
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,043
You should cover it with dirt
and pat it nicely.

179
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,629
Please talk to Do-jae.

180
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,464
He won't listen to me.

181
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,717
Is there anyone who listens to you
more than him?

182
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,638
If I go, I feel like I would pull him
like a weed.

183
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,974
So, you go and pat him.

184
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,151
How do you feel?

185
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,905
Sorry. I ruined the trip.

186
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,865
Why do you apologize for your sickness?

187
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,660
You should apologize to yourself
for harassment.

188
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,664
I'm sorry.

189
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,542
Isn't today shooting practice?

190
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,544
Will that be OK?

191
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,004
Yes.

192
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,006
I am going to meet with an action team.

193
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,633
Alright.

194
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,303
Filming will begin soon.
Take good care of yourself.

195
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:12,930
Go.

196
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:15,307
Director,

197
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,227
may I ask you a question?

198
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:19,561
Yes.

199
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,482
Why does it have to be her?

200
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:24,775
Yu-ri?

201
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,026
Yes.

202
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:28,988
Why do you like her?

203
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,746
She is not like you.

204
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,540
How?

205
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,001
I want to know.

206
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:47,172
She loves herself too much,

207
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,508
unlike you.

208
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,051
You two have

209
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,679
completely opposite problems.

210
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:55,681
So...

211
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,518
take good care of her.

212
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,609
Hold here.

213
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,579
Senior, I heard you got separated.

214
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,457
Don't act silly when I am holding a gun.

215
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,376
People say it was because of rumors.
It that true?

216
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,798
It feels awkward to be called senior.
You spoke with no respect before.

217
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,888
Me? When?

218
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,100
"Me?"

219
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,561
"When?"

220
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,563
I guess I was drunk.

221
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,523
I have a bad drinking habit.

222
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,234
I lose memory and stuff.

223
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,695
When did you get separated?

224
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,697
Is that why you acted that way
on the trip?

225
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,617
Did you drink so much
because of the separation?

226
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,826
You said you don't remember.

227
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,120
No, I don't.

228
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,999
-Senior...
-Hey!

229
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,667
Don't talk to me.

230
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,171
Do you know?

231
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,173
I saved your life.

232
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,593
If I didn't get help,
you wouldn't be here.

233
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,179
You are making a lot of noise.

234
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,264
Shall I shoot her?

235
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,265
What?

236
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,601
That would be a waste of bullets.

237
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,605
That is not true.

238
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,108
Write the facts.

239
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,445
A beautiful separation for each other.

240
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,114
That's it.

241
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:42,121
I feel so embarassed.

242
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,748
Do you know what kind of trouble
I was in?

243
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,334
Since when have you been
in the relationship?

244
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,211
Since yesterday.

245
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,255
Why did you ask me to send
the report to the media?

246
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,091
Just... because.

247
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,554
-I quit.
-No.

248
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,764
-Then, raise my salary.
-No.

249
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,225
-I'm going home.
-No.

250
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,520
You still have 30 minutes left.

251
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,697
Did you have an appointment
with your father?

252
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,325
Father, why did you come?

253
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:23,745
Oh, I was in the neighborhood...

254
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,332
and I wanted to see you.

255
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,251
Is that what my mother asked you

256
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,794
to say here?

257
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:38,177
The rubber trees make scars on them

258
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,888
to fully live their lives.

259
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,224
Also, some fields are burned

260
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:47,186
to support new lives.

261
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,443
Every tree has a scar.

262
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,403
Even though your love did not work out,

263
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,615
-it will be the basis--
-That's not it.

264
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,577
It's OK. It's always like that
in the beginning.

265
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,495
Then you grow...

266
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,206
and forget.

267
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,540
That's not it.

268
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,129
Don't be too mad.

269
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:15,964
If it's too hard,

270
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,383
cry or something.

271
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,676
It's not hard.

272
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,762
A good woman will show up.

273
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,514
She does not have eyes for a good man.

274
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,643
How can she break up
with such a nice man like you?

275
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:35,400
Does she want to reconsider, by any means?

276
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,991
I am sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

277
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,829
Would you like a drink?

278
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,346
It's not working. We should find a way.

279
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:05,931
Fully agreed.

280
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,894
Why did you send that to the media?
You made things more complicated!

281
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,272
It was your idea.

282
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:16,149
So, you go ahead right after I said it?

283
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,567
Should I not have done that?

284
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,487
You are so dull.

285
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,657
I am not used to it.

286
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,616
Don't say that!

287
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,034
Why?

288
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,246
You don't like me like this?

289
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,581
No, I get so sympathetic.

290
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,919
It hurts my heart.

291
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,130
That is touching.

292
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,800
Of course. You don't need to be touched.

293
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,471
Do you see anything different
about me today?

294
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,683
That's the question men hate the most.

295
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:50,767
That's why I'm asking.

296
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,938
Your earrings look good on you.

297
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,400
I knew it. You are not like other men.

298
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,153
You have good taste.

299
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,949
Are you praising me, or yourself?

300
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,537
-Me?
-Hold on.

301
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,543
OK.

302
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,295
What are you doing?

303
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:19,921
I'm not doing anything.

304
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,967
I need to go home.
See you at our next secret rendezvous.

305
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:27,971
Han Se-gye,

306
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,390
call me when you get home.

307
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,475
Why?

308
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:32,726
I'll worry.

309
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,786
Oh my god! What was that?
He really acts like a boyfriend.

310
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,047
Where did you go?

311
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,256
You scared me!

312
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,884
That is...

313
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,554
someone I know was bereaved, so...

314
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,518
Someone you know was bereaved, so...

315
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,896
you went out with such pretty earrings?

316
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,611
Did you go to see your "uncle"

317
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,196
in this messy situation?

318
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,031
How did you find out?

319
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,449
About uncle?

320
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,827
How do you think I found out?

321
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,497
You said everything at the interview.

322
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:44,131
I am cancelling all the interviews,
and you are...

323
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:50,929
Tell your uncle to cancel

324
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,474
the T-road company interview
as smoothly as possible.

325
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,351
Shall... I?

326
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,151
No...

327
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,528
Let's not cancel.

328
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,572
Why? What are you doing now?

329
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,700
A risk is an opportunity.

330
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,668
I am not sure
if this is right thing to do.

331
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:22,878
Just trust me.

332
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,146
Oh my goodness.

333
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,450
Big news.

334
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,076
What is it?

335
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,286
What now?

336
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,246
What is it?

337
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,414
What is going on?

338
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,874
What? What is it?

339
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,919
Han Se-gye is in the lobby right now.

340
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,423
-Wow.
-Oh dear!

341
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,341
Han Se-gye?

342
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:35,158
Han Se-gye is going to our floor now.

343
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,500
Wh...what is happening?

344
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,126
Why did she come after breaking up?

345
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,045
-To meet the Director?
-The Director?

346
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,798
-Should I go out and check?
-It will be too obvious.

347
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,971
I... just don't know what to do.

348
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,641
This is the model of the airplane
we plan to purchase, and...

349
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,687
We need your approval to proceed...

350
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,106
I AM HERE. HEADING FOR INTERVIEW ROOM.

351
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:12,487
Where are you going?

352
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,739
Do you want a salary cut?

353
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,826
Big news!

354
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,248
She just... arrived.

355
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,292
Han se-gye, in the hallway.

356
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,836
So she just arrived
and is walking in the hallway.

357
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,921
What if she comes
to the director's office?

358
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:30,964
What do we do?

359
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:34,384
I'll pretend that I got lost
and check the situation.

360
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,846
Why would you get lost in our building?
You are even a team leader.

361
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,222
Right.

362
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,308
Take your toothbrush.

363
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:44,269
Why a toothbrush after lunch hour?
That is even more suspicious.

364
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:47,355
Pretend you have braces.
They always need to brush their teeth.

365
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,565
But I don't have braces.

366
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,776
Pretend you have a lingual orthodontic,
inside your teeth.

367
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,069
Oh, genius!

368
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:38,531
You came to work?

369
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,367
Are you going out to work?

370
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,286
Please take good care of yourself.
I'm asking as a director.

371
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:52,629
No worries. I am a model of this company.

372
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,344
Good luck!

373
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,268
Call me when you're done.

374
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,938
-We'll get something to eat.
-OK.

375
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,148
-It's on me.
-OK.

376
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,366
They are so cool.

377
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,909
I thought I was in Hollywood.

378
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,202
The air is cold.

379
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:27,414
They are the ones who broke up.
Why do I feel like I am dumped?

380
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,335
Oh my god, oh my god!
I never spoke to you that casually.

381
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,294
I know.

382
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,422
Your acting has improved.

383
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,091
I was very nervous.
I guess it wasn't too obvious.

384
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,968
I guess that's why your hand was cold.

385
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,348
Sorry, it was my colleague.

386
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:46,516
Shall we continue?

387
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,519
I guess you are doing well.

388
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:52,063
We were afraid you might cancel
the interview.

389
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:57,193
It's not like we shouldn't meet
just because we broke up.

390
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,320
He is a good friend.

391
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,573
And I respect him as a person.

392
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:03,992
Can we begin the shoot?

393
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:04,909
Yes.

394
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:14,294
Is that what they call
"a cold and handsome man"?

395
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:24,929
Oh, just a minute.
I got a business message.

396
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:29,768
I haven't texted you.
Who are you talking to?

397
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,729
Yes. Just a minute. Almost done.

398
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:34,981
Are you even listening to me?

399
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,277
-Are you?
-Wha... What?

400
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:41,946
Never mind.

401
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,033
What should I do now?

402
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,367
Now you can...

403
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,370
go home.

404
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,583
Go home? Already?

405
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,543
Yes. Go home.

406
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:07,055
-Hey. Give it here.
-Why?

407
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,849
It makes me nervous. Give it to me.

408
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,977
Why? I did well.

409
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,147
You just have to reveal it.

410
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,108
When did I reveal it?

411
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:22,237
What's up with your profile picture
on the messenger?

412
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,780
That hand!

413
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,865
It's Seo Do-jae's hand!

414
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,084
What are you talking about?
It's just an ad.

415
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,628
Are you an elementary school kid?

416
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,714
No. Even they are better than you.

417
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,759
Even they don't show their relations
that way.

418
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:07,782
Hey!

419
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,618
Why are you suddenly putting on perfume?

420
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:11,870
Why?

421
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,330
It's to make you feel good.

422
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:17,083
To change the atmosphere,
the mood, and the subject!

423
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,003
Pew! It smells!

424
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,297
Look ahead.

425
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,259
You're going to crash. Look ahead!

426
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,763
I said I'm not going anywhere!

427
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,849
I won't leave until you go in.

428
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,309
I am going in!

429
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:40,648
After I see you go in, I will wait
out front for 30 minutes, and then leave.

430
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:44,444
Jeez. I'm going in now. Watch. I'm going.

431
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,120
You watch out.

432
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,080
Behave.

433
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,667
Don't cause trouble.

434
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,127
Don't worry.

435
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:29,822
That was too much!

436
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,540
What's up with your pass code? 10041004?

437
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,376
Are you obsessed with angels?

438
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:44,170
Should I change it to a number
I don't care about, like 0116?

439
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,630
You care about it now.

440
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,053
Stop saying such things out of the blue,
I said.

441
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,807
You smell nice.

442
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,560
You don't do this any more?

443
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,897
I don't need to.
I don't forget your smell.

444
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,235
I will only wear this one.

445
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,195
I can't even change my perfume.

446
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,239
This relationship is so particular.

447
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,700
I would appreciate it if you would think

448
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,786
rather than particular,
this relationship is unchanging.

449
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,163
I would appreciate it, too.

450
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,584
By the way,
a secret relationship is so thrilling!

451
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,878
Having a secret is so fun.

452
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,715
I've been uneasy, sad, and lonely.

453
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,843
Now, we will be uneasy, sad,

454
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,845
and lonely together.

455
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:39,392
Can we be not uneasy, sad,
and lonely together?

456
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,228
I will try as hard as I can.

457
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,022
I feel better!

458
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,423
That light bulb...

459
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,176
why haven't you changed it?

460
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,430
I've been waiting
until I become a tall person.

461
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,600
Shall I change it for you?

462
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:28,441
Oh my!

463
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,487
Could you do that one more time?

464
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,529
What?

465
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,115
Pull your shirt and watch off.

466
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,035
You find that attractive?

467
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,919
So cool and sexy. But It's funny!

468
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,504
You are funny and cute, but sexy.

469
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,006
-What are you doing tomorrow?
-Working.

470
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,300
-I'm going to work, too.
-Why?

471
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:59,597
I don't want to work. I was wondering
if we could afford not working.

472
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,726
Wow. This is the first time
you said you didn't want to work.

473
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,562
What's going on?

474
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,773
I guess you really like me!

475
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:10,483
Yes.

476
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,403
So it would seem.

477
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,450
Do you know what I just thought?

478
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,285
You will be so surprised.

479
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,124
"I want to change right now.

480
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,794
Then, we could be together."

481
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,135
This is...

482
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,807
the first time I want to change.

483
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,188
Really.

484
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,440
What was it like the first time?

485
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,110
I did everything.

486
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,738
I went a church to pray,
to a temple to bow 108 times,

487
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,365
and to a shaman for a rite.

488
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:04,662
But I am OK, now.

489
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:09,250
After difficult times,
something I want comes true, too.

490
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,710
Just like now.

491
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,464
Or...

492
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:20,094
to realize my dreams,
I needed those difficult times.

493
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,014
No matter what the sequence is,

494
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,018
I want you to be happy.

495
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,189
So it would seem.

496
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,817
I am...

497
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,528
very happy now.

498
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,250
Go carefully.

499
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:52,668
Don't get caught.

500
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,337
I will.

501
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,005
I won't get caught.

502
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,590
Seo Do-jae.

503
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:02,220
Shall I drive you?

504
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,479
We're already here.

505
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:13,356
Good night.

506
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,274
So...

507
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,277
what are you going to drive home?

508
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:19,612
Huh?

509
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:21,489
This is my car.

510
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:37,338
Good night. Sleep well.

511
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,423
Thank you for the ride.

512
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:42,093
Go in. I want to make sure you get in.

513
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,081
Would you like some ramen before you go?

514
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,469
I told you to stay home.

515
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,555
So you bring him here?

516
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,266
U-mi, it's not like that.

517
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:33,769
I knew it when you put the perfume on.

518
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,022
You just have to make me work at night.

519
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,482
Secretary Jeong, it's not like--

520
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,901
I knew it when you looked in the mirror.

521
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:45,323
Residents reported that suspicious
people are wandering around,

522
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:48,409
-it turns out to be these two!
-You two sure look suspicious.

523
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,995
You are pulling your hats down
and avoiding eye contact.

524
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,477
What's your name?

525
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,020
You U-mi.

526
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,313
You-mi?

527
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,439
You U-mi.

528
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:19,648
Ah, You-mi?

529
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:26,030
Oh! I'm so sorry!

530
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:29,241
You two walk like that.
No wonder people feel nervous.

531
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:32,953
When he shows his face,

532
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,456
everyone tries to fight with him, so...

533
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:40,169
Yes... I am kind of like that.

534
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,423
I guess I didn't cover him enough.

535
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,178
Now they are using the police to fight.

536
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,138
Right honey?

537
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:55,142
It looks like you're trying
to fight with me.

538
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,354
Anyway, watch out.

539
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:04,402
-Yes. Sorry. Go in.
-Sorry.

540
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,820
Sorry.

541
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,530
Go in.

542
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,242
-Go in.
-Don't worry.

543
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,743
We will try to stay home.

544
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,495
I will lock her in.

545
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:26,173
Where are you touching? Honey?

546
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,967
You, Han Se-gye!

547
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:49,780
I so wish I had a makeup removing machine!

548
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,538
What are you doing?

549
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,040
I've done this many times. Don't worry.

550
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,293
My friend gets wasted often.

551
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:06,297
As Han Se-gye is an actress,

552
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,923
I take care of her skin.

553
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:13,554
I am not going to get up
or anything like that.

554
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,933
I am so tired I cannot lift a finger.

555
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,227
Why?

556
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,732
Thanks to your friend.

557
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,277
They got separated?

558
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,447
It would be fine if that was all it was.

559
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,034
But they chose to have a cool separation.

560
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:37,786
So I have a lot to think about.

561
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:42,208
And President Kim just talks nonsense.

562
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:46,212
Why doesn't he do it on his own?

563
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,297
He shouldn't call me to come...

564
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,384
I usually don't tell others
something like this.

565
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:54,220
Why did I say this?

566
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:58,057
Because I listen.

567
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:02,144
It's because no one listened
to you before.

568
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:05,397
I will listen to you.

569
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,358
Tell me everything.

570
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,114
What is this?

571
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,784
What?

572
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,078
You want something from me.

573
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,747
Wow. How did you know?

574
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,084
I am a businesswoman.

575
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:27,461
What is it?

576
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:33,384
You have a lot of money, don't you?
Do you want to donate?

577
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:38,180
You are selling donations like blankets.

578
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:43,936
If I make a donation,
what will you do for me?

579
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,940
If you make a donation,

580
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:49,942
I will smile.

581
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,613
You said my smile is worth money.

582
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:09,253
Where did you get this much stuff?

583
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,840
From someone who likes smiles.

584
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:34,695
She is tenacious.

585
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:38,907
What do you mean?
It looks like she is in great pain.

586
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:43,287
After her son's death, she donated
his heart to another kid.

587
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,789
Giving my kid's heart to someone...

588
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,291
I could never do that!

589
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,669
What's the use?
It would be gone once it's buried.

590
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,421
I think I would feel better

591
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:55,466
to know that my son's heart is working
for another kid.

592
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:11,815
Did you decide which calling
you will take, Julianus?

593
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:21,992
I made the decision
a long time ago, Father.

594
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,441
Come home.

595
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:57,194
How did you find me?

596
00:44:57,736 --> 00:45:00,531
It doesn't matter. Just come back,

597
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,992
before your mom really passes out.

598
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:07,955
I can't live the way mom wants.

599
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,374
I get it, so come home.

600
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:19,049
That is how we wrote the contract.

601
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:22,010
Look at this
and tell me if that is possible.

602
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,555
Does it make sense to take a week off?

603
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:27,307
I wrote that in the contract for a reason.

604
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:30,853
If you don't abide by the contract,

605
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,731
I will have no choice
but to take legal measures.

606
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:36,859
We will go to another town soon,
so just be patient.

607
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,028
Or you go and talk
to the director directly!

608
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:43,240
Even the main role is not doing this.
Don't push it too hard.

609
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,911
Wow.

610
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:49,997
What the...

611
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,967
Do you like to make people nervous?

612
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,511
Do you like to pick fights?

613
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,722
You wanted to take time off.

614
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,142
Why don't you just stay out of the film?

615
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,186
For whose benefit?

616
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:15,022
For all of us.

617
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,860
We're the ones who have to suffer
if you cause trouble.

618
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,278
That's enough.

619
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:25,199
Apparently, you are busy pretending
to have a good break-up.

620
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,367
Can you try that hard for your work?

621
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:29,203
Please?

622
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,124
Then,

623
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:37,169
let's do what we can.

624
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:40,547
Are you crazy?
You might get in big trouble.

625
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,091
You don't have many days left.

626
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,468
It will be worse without me.

627
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:47,471
-You grew up after being dumped.
-I was not dumped.

628
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,348
Right, you dumped him!

629
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:51,433
What did I hear?

630
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,727
"He's a good friend"?

631
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,438
"I respect him as a person"?

632
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,149
How do you know? You don't read about me.

633
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:01,109
Oh, someone told me.

634
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,194
Who?

635
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:03,904
Someone.

636
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:05,781
Fine.

637
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:07,533
Let's try.

638
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,410
Tell me when you feel danger.

639
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:13,872
I will take you out of the site
like an abduction.

640
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:18,293
I will get the OK sign the first try,
so we will finish quickly.

641
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,921
I will give them tons of free time.

642
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,966
Do you want to volunteer your free time?

643
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:26,802
Sorry. I will be too busy playing.

644
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:28,220
What about donations then?

645
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:31,265
No thanks. I wanted to,
but I don't anymore, since you ask for it.

646
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:37,020
Zipping your mouth would help
you recruit volunteers.

647
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,985
I went to the Welfare Center
that we visited before.

648
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,364
The woman you saved....

649
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:49,741
as I heard,

650
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,828
she gave her dead son's heart

651
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,039
to another kid.

652
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,836
Wow, that is admirable.

653
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,506
Not everyone can do it.

654
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,719
You can't say

655
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:10,971
"good job!", either.

656
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:13,640
I know.

657
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,436
I think about her sometimes.

658
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:23,400
I think of her empty eyes. They looked
like seeing the end of the world.

659
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,696
One world must have ended

660
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,115
for her.

661
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:37,706
It's a good day to drink!

662
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,545
What about rice noodle soup
for our hangovers tomorrow?

663
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,130
-OK?
-OK.

664
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:46,924
OK.

665
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:52,763
See you tomorrow.

666
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:54,973
I will bring Gging-ggang.

667
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:56,350
Leaving already?

668
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:59,978
I can't stay out too late
when I am staying someone else's house.

669
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:00,896
Good night.

670
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:03,482
Bye.

671
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:06,276
Such a nice coat!

672
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,780
He is making a dramatic exit...

673
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,325
-Aren't you worried?
-About what?

674
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:14,660
He said he became a slave.

675
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,912
He told Ahram that he slept on the street.

676
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,790
-What did he say to you?
-I didn't ask.

677
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,793
He is a grown man. He will be fine.

678
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:26,630
-What kind of friend are you?
-I did that because I am a friend.

679
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,598
We should make sure.

680
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,290
Is this OK?

681
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,751
What if he gets abused by bad people?

682
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,421
-We are the bad ones here.
-No.

683
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:33,447
I'm back.

684
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,033
You are a bit late.

685
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:16,364
This is funny.

686
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:22,287
This is...

687
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:25,290
I've heard you've been looking
for my weakness.

688
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:29,920
But I think I am the one
who found the weakness,

689
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:31,713
just now.

690
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:36,134
I'm not following you.

691
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,180
I am not her weakness.

692
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,517
I am going to leave the house.

693
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,777
Thank you for letting me stay.

694
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:56,029
Ryu Eun-ho!

695
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,157
You guys leave, too.

696
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,368
We will talk tomorrow.

697
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,088
I told you...

698
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,133
we are the bad ones.

699
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:26,059
This is for the chandelier, after my wage.

700
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,770
Do you know how much it is?

701
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:31,731
I searched for the lowest price.
It was 388,000 won.

702
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,276
You were more frugal than I thought.

703
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:36,403
And this is

704
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:41,950
a small token of my appreciation
for letting me stay here.

705
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:54,254
-What will you tell your friends?
-I'll tell them the truth.

706
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,340
The truth?

707
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:58,842
It was a sort of my job.

708
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:04,139
When are you leaving?

709
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:05,557
Tomorrow.

710
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,144
-When did you decide?
-Today.

711
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,113
Will you still come if I call?

712
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:25,202
I don't mean anything else.

713
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:28,914
I am just asking because it's bothersome
to find a good maid.

714
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,291
Even if I find one,

715
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:34,419
it takes time
for her to get used to my house.

716
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:36,546
Will you call?

717
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:40,884
Then, I will come.

718
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:49,809
When did you find out
the price for chandelier?

719
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,063
Right after I broke it.

720
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:02,197
Kids these days are too aggresive.

721
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:07,535
OK then.

722
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,414
I will call, and you come.

723
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:06,636
It's too sweet.

724
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,380
I told him I don't eat breakfast.

725
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:31,304
Good soup.
My stomach feels much better now.

726
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:35,642
Oh, the best hangover soup is...

727
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:37,560
rice noodle soup.

728
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,067
-About yesterday...
-Let's eat.

729
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:51,699
Why should I feel so small?
You are the one who talked--

730
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:56,079
Get this straight.
I haven't sold your information.

731
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:01,167
Are you dating with her?

732
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,003
-Really?
-No!

733
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,090
OK. You don't have to be upset.

734
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:10,552
This is a matter of respect among friends,

735
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:13,179
and respect to someone who took me in
when I had nowhere to go.

736
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,936
But... how are we supposed to understand
what you said?

737
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:22,439
Talk in detail.

738
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:32,574
Sorry. I followed you
because I was worried.

739
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,869
I know.
That's why I am not saying anything.

740
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,922
Should I do it?

741
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:50,675
The donation?

742
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:52,719
Yes.

743
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,972
And you say "Yes" so fast...

744
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,309
Are you fully awake?

745
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:00,268
And sober?

746
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:04,105
She is completely awake.
She is not offering to buy a house.

747
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:07,233
I only make promises I can keep.

748
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:09,777
Are you going to the filming place?

749
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:14,908
I should.
That's also a promise I need to keep.

750
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:18,786
I am sorry, friend.

751
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:20,622
We were just worried.

752
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:23,249
Good girls.

753
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:33,092
What's this?

754
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,844
Did we get the time wrong?

755
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:38,056
-No.
-What time are we supposed to be here?

756
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,475
-We are even late.
-What?

757
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:45,939
What's this?

758
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:49,317
For your happiness.
From Han-Se-gy's fan.

759
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:19,055
Your uncle likes to make a big deal.

760
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,602
Do you only buy fish with money?

761
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,272
Why didn't you call before you came?

762
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:13,318
Do I need to inform you
when I come to my office?

763
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:23,369
You cannot even do your business right?

764
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:27,415
I am doing my work right.

765
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:30,960
I heard you broke up with the model.

766
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:33,046
I told you she is an actress,
not a model.

767
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:34,756
How did you find out?

768
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:38,384
I'm on the internet.
Everyone is talking about it.

769
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:43,973
You got dumped here and there.

770
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,684
You are so incapable.

771
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:51,022
Good work, Grandpa.
You surfed the web on your own.

772
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:53,816
You cannot handle a woman,
but you can still talk.

773
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:56,778
Stop, please, and leave.

774
01:00:57,195 --> 01:01:00,114
You don't have to rub salt in the wound.

775
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:01,949
Do you want me to handle it?

776
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,452
How, with your money?

777
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,329
She has lots of money.

778
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:11,000
That's why you got dumped.

779
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:15,922
You have to give what she needs the most.

780
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:19,092
How does a businessman not know that?

781
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:26,641
What she wants the most is...

782
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,770
not to see me anymore.

783
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,439
You are so incapable.

784
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,335
Yes, I am broken.

785
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:56,504
And you, too.

786
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,384
But now that I know of your existence,

787
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:04,679
I came out into the world.

788
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:11,477
Maybe... you've been waiting for me, too.

789
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:19,861
I've been waiting...

790
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:23,865
to throw your broken life
into the trashcan.

791
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:45,762
Cut, OK.

792
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:50,266
Cut OK. Get ready for Scene C-5.

793
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:51,851
Le't's get ready.

794
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:08,534
Will you really be OK?

795
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,036
Should I call it off?

796
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,455
It's OK. I have one scene left.

797
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:16,918
-We just need to shoot on more scene.
-I am so nervous.

798
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:20,213
I still have two days left.

799
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:23,049
It could be up to five days off.

800
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:28,387
It is OK. I think it will be OK.

801
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:44,737
You are my mistake and imperfection.

802
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:47,114
When you disappear,

803
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:50,493
I will be complete.

804
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:23,651
-Cut, OK.
-It is OK!

805
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,436
Are you OK?

806
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:15,161
How old am I?

807
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,792
Assistant Director!

808
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:24,837
One of the child actors didn't make it
because he was sick.

809
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:25,880
What?

810
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:28,257
Ah, shit!

811
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:31,052
The director will be very upset.

812
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:33,763
What can we do?

813
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,224
He doesn't have any lines,

814
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:39,727
so bring anyone.
He just has to stand there.

815
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:40,645
OK.

816
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:42,229
Move quickly.

817
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:47,610
Somehow I wanted to bring...

818
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:50,404
kids' clothes.

819
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,077
What's size of clothes?

820
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:58,079
Between 9 and 10.

821
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:06,504
Then, I will be 10,
to reduce the generation gap.

822
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:08,589
You look young.

823
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:24,105
No, he does not know
anything about acting!

824
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:27,274
Another kid will do the line.
He just has to stand there.

825
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:30,444
-We will take him for now.
-No!

826
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:43,958
-Why don't we have a mom?
-Cut!

827
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:47,920
Let's do it again.

828
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:52,842
Action!

829
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:57,054
-Why don't we have a mom?
-Cut, cut, cut!

830
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:01,809
Take it slow. Again!

831
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:05,604
Action!

832
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:07,523
-Why don't we--
-Cut!

833
01:07:10,484 --> 01:07:11,527
Let's take a break.

834
01:07:14,613 --> 01:07:17,491
I did not want to be part of this,
but I can't help it.

835
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:22,163
Kid!

836
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:24,373
Kid? Me?

837
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:27,043
-Yes, you.
-You are a kid, too.

838
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:29,712
Right. I am a kid, too.

839
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:32,131
Hey, friend.

840
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:34,633
Do it like this.

841
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:42,850
Why don't we have a mom?

842
01:07:43,684 --> 01:07:45,853
Why don't we have a mom?

843
01:07:45,936 --> 01:07:47,646
No, no, cut, cut!

844
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:50,483
That is not it.

845
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:59,033
Why... don't we have a mom?

846
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:01,577
Like that!

847
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:04,914
Why don't we have a mom?

848
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,042
Give him the line.

849
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:16,175
Why don't we have a mom?

850
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:20,513
Then, where did I come from?

851
01:08:22,389 --> 01:08:24,391
Where should I go to?

852
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:39,490
Cut! Great. Good job!

853
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:47,123
What's your name? Where is your mom?

854
01:08:47,581 --> 01:08:50,459
You act really well.
Do you have an agency?

855
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:53,587
I am from DM...

856
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:57,049
Hey, he has been taken.

857
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,762
Great job, my dear actor!

858
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:04,515
He's with World Entertainment.

859
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:12,356
I should get a booster seat or something.

860
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:13,357
Sorry.

861
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:15,234
No worries!

862
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:17,278
You even took one more scene
than scheduled.

863
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:21,615
You did so well. Great work!

864
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:26,120
They are going a few different places,
so take a good break.

865
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:28,122
I felt a bit sad
when I didn't get the main role.

866
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:29,456
But this is convenient.

867
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:32,418
I know. Should we keep taking
supporting roles?

868
01:09:32,793 --> 01:09:33,878
This is a great idea.

869
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,215
Hey, by the way...

870
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:42,428
how will I get home?

871
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:24,345
There you go!

872
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,430
We did it! Sit.

873
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:33,062
Do you really have to eat this?

874
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:34,939
Should I rinse it?

875
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:37,191
It looks too spicy for you.

876
01:10:37,274 --> 01:10:38,817
-It's OK.
-No!

877
01:10:39,526 --> 01:10:41,904
It's not good. Give it to me.

878
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:45,532
You are grown up in your heart,

879
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:47,243
but your tummy is still a kid's.

880
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:49,328
You will get sick if you eat this.

881
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:54,416
I really wanted to eat spicy tteok-bokki.

882
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,126
True that!

883
01:10:58,587 --> 01:10:59,880
This is strong flavor!

884
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:09,014
I was scared to death.
I thought you would be discovered.

885
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:10,182
Me too!

886
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:12,893
I am glad you weren't discovered.

887
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:16,939
Eat. Eat all you want, my sweetie!

888
01:11:18,899 --> 01:11:20,442
Hey, would you stop?

889
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:24,196
Would you stop saying "hey" to me?

890
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:29,118
FROM: MOM

891
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,127
What are you going to do?

892
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:39,670
What can I do?

893
01:11:40,337 --> 01:11:41,171
I can't pick up.

894
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:45,843
Your life is...

895
01:11:49,346 --> 01:11:50,597
Have a drink!

896
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:52,975
Let's drink!

897
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,274
Did you call Seo Do-jae?

898
01:12:00,357 --> 01:12:01,275
No!

899
01:12:01,358 --> 01:12:03,819
Come here, come.

900
01:12:04,361 --> 01:12:06,697
Han Se-gye, mom is here.

901
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:08,115
Mom?

902
01:12:09,116 --> 01:12:10,159
Mom!

903
01:12:25,632 --> 01:12:26,508
Who is this?

904
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:58,707
