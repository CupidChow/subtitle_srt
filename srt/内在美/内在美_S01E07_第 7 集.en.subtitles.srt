1
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,428
Sounds like destiny.

2
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:55,889
Us?

3
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:29,798
Sorry.

4
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,505
I felt like I should.

5
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,052
Excuse me?

6
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,596
I thought it was proper.

7
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,225
Where are you going?

8
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,856
We satisfied your curiosity.
We should go to bed.

9
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:30,817
Together?

10
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,403
No, separately.

11
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,446
There's no reason to share a bed.

12
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:41,786
Why? Aren't you sleepy?

13
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,020
EPISODE 7

14
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,274
Me, too.

15
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,154
I thought it was proper, too.

16
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,405
OK.

17
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,160
Say something.

18
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,494
No.

19
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,875
I feel like I'm not really myself.

20
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,088
I feel like I am someone else.

21
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,301
I feel perplexed and confused--

22
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,265
But you are Han Se-gye.

23
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,559
Not someone else.

24
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,906
I might know what you want to hear.

25
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,618
-Then, say it.
-No.

26
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,749
So... good night.

27
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:28,935
UNCLE

28
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:44,534
Why isn't he calling? Why not?

29
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,202
It's already been an hour.

30
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:54,836
Shouldn't he text me that he's home?
It has been one hour and one minute.

31
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,218
Did you get home safely?

32
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,277
Are you sleeping?

33
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,113
You can sleep in this situation?

34
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,825
He can't be.

35
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,830
No reply? In this situation?

36
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,134
Why aren't you eating?

37
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,429
Can you eat meat for breakfast?

38
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,349
I have a dress rehearsal later.

39
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,768
If I don't want to lose to a young one,

40
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,436
I should watch my body.

41
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:58,358
Eat a little bit.
This little won't make you gain weight.

42
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,365
We're on a reading trip this week.

43
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,532
So suddenly?

44
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:11,454
We go somewhere to practice reading
and building relationships.

45
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:16,793
It was this week, so I agreed.
It's your safe week.

46
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,922
OK. Sounds good. Let's go.

47
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:23,841
By the way...

48
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,931
Why does a man kiss
someone and pretend like nothing happened?

49
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,058
Maybe he did not want to do it.

50
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,147
Why?

51
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,192
Did you kiss him?

52
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:45,154
No, I was just wondering...

53
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,407
you know that movie...

54
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,243
I was thinking about that kiss.

55
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:54,247
I had to repeat the scene
more than 20 times.

56
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,376
But I had no feelings whatsoever.

57
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,128
No one asked.

58
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,172
Absolutely nothing...

59
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,217
for me, too.

60
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,053
Are you really dating him?

61
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,305
Dating? No way!

62
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,226
Dating is nothing special.

63
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,812
It's like...

64
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,023
he peels the shrimp

65
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,860
and grills the meat for you.

66
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,820
That is dating.

67
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,781
-He didn't peel shrimp.
-Maybe you didn't eat it?

68
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,702
What is it? Then are you and I dating now?

69
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,621
It's more than that. We are in business.

70
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,296
Right.

71
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,925
We are in business.

72
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:54,348
We must be...

73
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,151
You are too old to run away.

74
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,028
You left because Mom said so?

75
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,405
You used to always be a good son.

76
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,616
-I was saving my rebellion.
-Hey.

77
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:15,536
Space out your rebellion.
Don't do it all at once.

78
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,080
-Stop saying "hey" to me.
-No.

79
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,042
Hey, where are you sleeping?

80
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,377
What the...

81
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:30,259
What do you care? I sleep on the street.

82
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,136
You're going to be a priest?

83
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,888
If you don't get married, 

84
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,473
I'll have to get married.

85
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,724
I like being single.

86
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,019
You will ruin my life!

87
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,026
Don't let me or anyone else ruin
your life.

88
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,654
That is why I left, too.

89
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,155
Big brother,

90
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,784
are you really not coming home?

91
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:56,661
How's Mom?

92
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,871
She's been in bed.

93
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,543
You're lucky that Dad hasn't come
home due to an emergency.

94
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,546
If he had, he would have shot you.

95
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,886
Are you OK?

96
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,015
Why did you come?

97
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,476
This bastard!

98
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,734
-What's up?
-Chief, we got the CCTV recording.

99
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:29,902
Find the vehicle?

100
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:33,114
We got the number and are checking
the suspect's past.

101
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,323
On my way.

102
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,866
Again?

103
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,327
I will be back soon.

104
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,789
Change your socks!

105
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,335
Where are there so many bad people?

106
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,046
The worst one is at our home.

107
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,342
He made you feel sad.

108
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,680
Then, go get your son first.

109
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:01,267
I often catch them and find out
they are actually good.

110
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,021
Get some rest. I will be back. Good luck!

111
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:12,278
Eun-ho is just like you.
After all, he is your son.

112
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:14,822
Be safe!

113
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,744
The event result is serious.

114
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,245
What does that mean?

115
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,749
It went really well,
so it can't be compared with past ones.

116
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:25,833
Congratulations!

117
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,502
What does that mean?

118
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,463
Are you listening?

119
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,590
No, not really.

120
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,263
If someone kisses you and says sorry,

121
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,640
what does that mean?

122
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,643
-Sorry.
-And then asks if there's anything to say?

123
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,228
In that case,
there are two possible answers.

124
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,981
"I love you" or "I am sorry."

125
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,068
What if you don't want to say sorry?

126
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,986
Then say "I love you."

127
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,741
What if you cannot say that either?

128
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:03,037
If you keep asking,
pay me extra for emotional labor.

129
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,040
What makes you so bold?

130
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,458
My face.

131
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:11,796
You will pay the price for lying because
I don't recognize faces.

132
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,006
You'll be the one who pays the price.

133
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,551
You have an appointment with Dr. Oh.
Go listen to him.

134
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,303
-And you?
-I have plans.

135
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,680
And they're urgent?

136
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,974
Not really. But they're scarier.

137
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,559
Meeting my mother?

138
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:26,977
It's  a secret.

139
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:31,565
No matter what she says,
don't take it the wrong way.

140
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,235
Maybe it's not a secret.

141
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,993
Given her cold personality,
we prepared mannish and black clothes.

142
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,746
This looks the same as Chae Yu-ri's.

143
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,631
This is to get some attention
in dark scenes.

144
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,676
We prepared a rather eye-catching
dress with flowers.

145
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,137
Chae Yu-ri also brought one of those.

146
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,850
This and this, too.

147
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,646
All of these?

148
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,608
-Get Chae Yu-ri.
-Yes.

149
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,030
Strange.

150
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:23,617
We could have similar tastes,
but all the same clothes?

151
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,801
I had to play six characters,

152
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,387
so I needed different types of clothes.

153
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,272
Do you have this, too?

154
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,987
Oh no! I have that, too.

155
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,741
Seasonal clothes were all similar.

156
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:09,455
Ah... so you play a character
who hides somewhere, fearing death.

157
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:14,126
But she wears a dress this fancy?
When and where?

158
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,009
The hiding character does not have
to wear dark clothes.

159
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,762
Maybe she wants to wear something
like that.

160
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,765
You are taking
all the clothes in this country.

161
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:34,021
OK. Take them all. I will film naked.
That will draw some attention.

162
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,901
Fine. It's people that act, not clothes.

163
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:49,620
Senior!

164
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,456
What? Want to something to say?

165
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,177
Are you upset?

166
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,263
What?

167
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,433
I won't wear them.
I don't need those clothes.

168
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,896
You are the important one.
So you wear them.

169
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,567
I will prepare mine again.

170
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:29,034
I am sorry for making you upset.

171
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,638
Chae Yu-ri did that on purpose.

172
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,475
Her stylists checked all our sponsor shops

173
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,770
and asked for our list.

174
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,355
Then, she acted!

175
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,692
She is cleverer than I thought.

176
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:05,905
Let her. It's been a while
since someone actually tried that hard.

177
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,783
She worked so hard to screw me.

178
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,327
Let her?

179
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,955
I don't know what I'll do
if she acts like that during the trip.

180
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,667
I lost completely today.

181
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:23,631
There are supposed to be
days where I lose.

182
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:32,014
UNCLE
DID YOU ARRIVE SAFELY?

183
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,440
Fine. I quit.

184
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:43,901
I quit.

185
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,320
Quit what?

186
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:49,073
Are you saying that you will retire again?

187
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,200
Schedules. I quit schedules.

188
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,536
Don't schedule anything.
I have to practice acting.

189
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,164
I already took care of it.

190
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,708
You have nothing except tomorrow.

191
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,418
Tomorrow?

192
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,171
I have something tomorrow? What is it?

193
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,298
-You have a date.
-Again?

194
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:11,136
Tomorrow? With Seo Do-jae?

195
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:17,017
I asked you to come
because I have something to say.

196
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,981
How much can you do for Do-jae?

197
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,859
Can you raise my salary?

198
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,153
Why do you ask?

199
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,572
I think I have more secrets to keep.

200
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,658
I work more, I should get paid more.

201
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,786
-Where's the money?
-It's in the bank.

202
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,330
So responsible.

203
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,960
Did you know...

204
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:48,841
-Do-jae is... ga...
-Ga?

205
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,513
-Do-jae likes m...
-M?

206
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,557
Never mind.

207
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,767
How's he doing with Han Se-gye?

208
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,729
-Are they together again?
-They never separated.

209
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,939
They have a public date tomorrow.

210
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:05,858
Good.

211
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,277
Monitor everything.

212
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,279
From what angle?

213
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,201
I think it would be OK
for them to get married.

214
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:17,703
Suddenly?

215
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,541
Do-jae is about to appear
in the society section of the paper,

216
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,627
not the entertainment section.
We should prevent that.

217
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,714
I am not prejudiced,

218
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,593
but a high-school kid? That is not right.

219
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,888
I am not following...

220
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,058
You must know, you are always next to him.

221
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,894
He meets men, too.

222
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,937
What?

223
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,315
Are you going abroad again?

224
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,860
True. So tell me how you've been doing.

225
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,740
My heart flutters.

226
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,035
Maybe I miss her.

227
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,871
-That sounds good.
-Is it good?

228
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:04,041
You did not like seeing things.

229
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,919
In some senses, you are improving.

230
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,757
But I feel like I am not myself.

231
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,468
In what perspective?

232
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:17,513
Business is all about saying
what others want to hear

233
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,557
to get what I want.

234
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,393
And I am very good at it.

235
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,021
But suddenly I do not want
to do that anymore.

236
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:31,193
Do you know what she wants to hear?

237
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,695
I think I know precisely.

238
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:35,948
What's that?

239
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:41,912
Sorry.

240
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,289
Sorry.

241
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,256
If you don't want to say it, don't.

242
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,261
Say what you want to say,
looking at the face you want to see.

243
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,096
Don't be afraid.

244
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:04,601
You just found another you.

245
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,898
These are essentials for housework.

246
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,067
-Please prepare them.
-All these?

247
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,402
By the way...

248
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,825
what are you wearing?

249
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,870
Oh, I don't get along with my sister.

250
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:25,789
I'm the same way.

251
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,958
If this is too much, look at my face.

252
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,837
You know you are handsome, don't you?

253
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,090
Everyone says
I am more pretty than handsome.

254
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,677
You say things like that yet
have a face like that.

255
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,346
Where is your humility?

256
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,224
I did not need them this urgently.

257
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,896
It's because I am too busy.
If not today, I don't know when.

258
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,691
Oh, I've been meaning to say...

259
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,611
Thanks for letting me stay with you.

260
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,322
I'll try to make you feel comfortable.

261
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,910
Well, the house is empty most of the time,

262
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,078
and it's okay for you to care for it.

263
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,873
That is why I agreed. Don't take it wrong.

264
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,502
I'll pay you back quickly and leave.

265
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,547
If you wish. Oh!

266
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,301
There's also something I've wanted to say.

267
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,305
I am not interested.

268
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,099
-In me?
-In younger guys.

269
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,101
Ah.

270
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,440
Oh!

271
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:36,902
Oh my, isn't that Eun-ho?

272
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:37,819
Hello!

273
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,657
It'll be promotional season soon.
Won't you join?

274
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:46,536
We sold so much thanks to you.

275
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,332
If I were the owner,
I would leave everything up to you.

276
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,126
I just found a really good job. Bye!

277
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:54,836
Bye!

278
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:02,928
How many jobs did you have?
Do you get jobs with your popularity?

279
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:07,432
My popularity is like public property.

280
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,894
It's not social property that I pay for.

281
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:15,399
I think you need to get paid
for your smile.

282
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,651
It has monetary value. Oh!

283
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:21,071
That was not praise,
only a status-quo analysis.

284
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:23,657
Should I pay you?

285
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,367
No.

286
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,676
What do you think of this?

287
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,593
It's fine.

288
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,348
-What about this?
-Fine.

289
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,185
This?

290
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,650
You've completely lost your mind!

291
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,985
Where are you?

292
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:02,988
Control tower.

293
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,282
Control tower? Why are you there?

294
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:07,492
Huh?

295
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,582
Uncle?

296
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,667
Do you talk to your uncle?

297
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,419
What are you talking about?

298
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,964
Oh, my uncle. I talk to him all the time.
Give it to me.

299
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,300
Hi, Uncle!

300
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,676
Where are you now?

301
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,679
How is everyone?
Is your business doing well?

302
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,557
I am at home. Why?

303
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,768
Can we meet? I'm at the cafe near you.

304
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,646
You call and say that out of nowhere.
What are you doing?

305
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,398
I have something to say.

306
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,818
OK. I'll be right there.

307
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:53,288
He is in the neighborhood
and wants to see me. I will be back soon.

308
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,831
-Shall I go with you?
-No!

309
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,001
You startled me.
You didn't have to scream.

310
00:22:58,585 --> 00:22:59,544
I mean...

311
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:04,216
my uncle is very introverted and passive.

312
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,889
He can't make eye contact
and doesn't like people.

313
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,309
OK. Go.

314
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,936
I'll be back soon.

315
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,557
Why are you staring at me?

316
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,809
In case I make a mistake.

317
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,896
It's the first time I've seen your hair
like this.

318
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,191
I just came from home, so...

319
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:48,111
Sorry if I made you nervous.

320
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,739
You shouldn't feel sorry about that.

321
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,783
What did you want to say?

322
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,746
Having a public relationship's good

323
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:58,997
at times like this.

324
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:03,627
We can meet publicly in a public place.

325
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,382
Here's a list of questions
for the interview.

326
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,429
Is this what you wanted to say?

327
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,806
We have to be on the same page.

328
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:23,522
Sure, because we are the couple
of the century.

329
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,690
What did I expect?

330
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,860
-The thing that happened...
-Was a mistake.

331
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,821
I just got carried away.

332
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,284
So stop avoiding me. You don't need to.

333
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,371
Did I avoid you?

334
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:42,624
What will you wear tomorrow?
We should match.

335
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,005
What else is there?

336
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,885
I did not reply to your text,
because time has passed too--

337
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,932
I'll send you my answers
to the questions.

338
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,559
Han Se-gye!

339
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:08,733
Take it easy.
Working at night doesn't feel good.

340
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,214
Here.

341
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,637
No thanks. I am on a diet.

342
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:44,811
Must be hard.

343
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,151
Nothing is harder than this.

344
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,821
What's next? The interview?

345
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:56,823
Next is...

346
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,122
this.

347
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:06,875
Open it.

348
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,503
This is to show my thanks
for the present you got me last time.

349
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,341
I should open this with a happy face,
right?

350
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,183
The directing is very detailed!

351
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,110
Is this good?

352
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,158
It's not directed.

353
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:45,372
I gave them to you because I wanted to.
Because they were pretty.

354
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,624
Because they look nice on you.

355
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,878
As you already have a necklace,

356
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,965
and that's not something I can change.

357
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:05,392
Many people are curious
about your love story.

358
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,644
Who confessed their feelings first?

359
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:08,770
I did.

360
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,107
May I ask you what you said?

361
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,693
"You are the nicest women I know."

362
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:20,615
I fell for her because of her nice heart
within a week of meeting her.

363
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,703
Oh! Are you thinking of that time?

364
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,579
Your face is turning red.

365
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:29,708
I just got a little hot.

366
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:34,462
How did you save each other's names
in your phones?

367
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:35,547
Oh...

368
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,174
-Auntie.
-Excuse me?

369
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,093
Uncle for me.

370
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,388
Is there any hidden meaning?

371
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,057
No, we just chose whatever.

372
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,268
Something not too suspicious.

373
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,980
Someone said I should do that.

374
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,483
Isn't that a cute idea?

375
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,610
How did she think of that?

376
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,322
This may be too much,

377
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,533
but when was your first kiss?

378
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,829
I will not comment on that.

379
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:09,748
We haven't.

380
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,794
We haven't kissed.

381
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:21,050
I said before I will quit
if you ask questions I did not agree to.

382
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,970
This interview is over.

383
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,848
I think you have enough for your story.

384
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,030
You didn't have to take me home.

385
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,199
I don't agree.

386
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,367
Oh, right. This was for the business.

387
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,579
You are always very thorough
with your work.

388
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,415
Thank you. Good bye.

389
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,501
What're you doing tomorrow?

390
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,131
I'm going far away for reading practice.

391
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,883
For a while. Why?

392
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,052
-What about in two days?
-Work.

393
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,595
-And the next day?
-Work.

394
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:06,596
I work, too.

395
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:07,680
I know.

396
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:09,641
We're both busy people.

397
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:14,521
Speaking of work, you worked hard today.

398
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,524
We did great business today.

399
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:20,276
How many more times must we do this?

400
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:22,737
This?

401
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:23,738
Work.

402
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:28,993
Let's finish up quickly,
so we can terminate our contract soon.

403
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:34,040
I feel uncomfortable... in many ways.

404
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:16,291
He said we didn't kiss? We didn't?

405
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:23,631
Fine. Let's say we didn't.

406
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:25,967
That is just cheap.

407
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,013
Oh my goodness!

408
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,566
Are you upset because I spoke
as I wished earlier?

409
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:44,444
-I was being considerate--
-That's why you're here?

410
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:45,486
Han Se-gye!

411
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:49,782
Considerate?

412
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,747
Are you trying to abuse
all the good words?

413
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,873
What do you mean?

414
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,374
Expectation, trust, etc.?

415
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,003
Do you know how I feel now?

416
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:07,008
Fine. You don't even remember me.

417
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,802
How would you know my feelings?

418
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,138
How would you feel in my heart?

419
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,474
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?

420
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:19,020
If so, I do not want to say it.

421
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:22,732
Don't say it. It's too late anyway.

422
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:05,566
So annoying.

423
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,368
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

424
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:27,648
Why do you look so sunken?
Didn't sleep last night?

425
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,568
There were too many crickets.

426
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:31,986
Where? Inside of you?

427
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:40,953
Sometimes, I wonder how much you know.

428
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:45,083
I know a lot, but I'm pretending I don't.

429
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,586
Did you eat breakfast? I brought food.

430
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:52,173
Later. I get indigestion
when I eat in the car.

431
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,180
You did it. It has been a while.

432
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:04,310
Top star H took C's clothes in jealousy.

433
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,813
News is that
troublemaker H attended

434
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:10,983
an audition for a supporting role
in the movie directed by L.

435
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,277
Habits don't die easy.

436
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,906
This time, she took C's clothes.

437
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:22,912
C had to give up her clothes
for her senior H.

438
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:27,875
Nevertheless, H did not even thank C
for her compromise.

439
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:32,463
Officials suspected
that this must have happened

440
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,049
as H was jealous for losing the role to C.

441
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,425
H is Han Se-gye.

442
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,094
C is Chae Yu-ri.

443
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,095
What the...

444
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:43,224
This damn crazy bitch! What the hell!

445
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,977
This annoying asshole!

446
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,689
This scumbag is driving me nuts!

447
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,232
What a bitch!

448
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:54,610
Get in.

449
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,493
Good shot!

450
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:04,495
Good shot!

451
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,622
Wow, how far did it go?

452
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:10,835
Men need men's time.

453
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,003
Don't you think?

454
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,880
I need time for myself, now.

455
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,799
Do you want to lose your job?

456
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,348
-Good shot.
-Good shot.

457
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,600
Good shot, Mr. Kim.

458
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,769
He's Mr. Seo, not Mr. Kim.

459
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,063
Is that right? Good shot, Mr. Seo.

460
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:32,732
Enough!

461
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,693
It's OK, Chairman.

462
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:38,821
He likes to joke around.

463
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:42,033
You are so mischievous. Always.

464
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,119
The three of you have a similar style.

465
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,747
It's hard to tell you apart.

466
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:52,919
Thank you for taking care
of that roughneck.

467
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,004
No problem. I didn't to anything.

468
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:59,300
He is just very good at his work,
and at love.

469
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,427
Is he in a relationship?

470
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,098
Are you dating that model?

471
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,351
I have been for a while.

472
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,311
Don't you surf the web?

473
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,395
What?

474
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,648
You are such a...

475
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,191
Good shot.

476
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,276
Good shot.

477
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:20,988
You treat me like a golf ball?
I even raised revenue.

478
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:27,912
So the Se-gye that my daughter wanted
that day was not the world,

479
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,288
but the model, right?

480
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,206
Actress.

481
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,624
Yes, that model.

482
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,876
Bring her over. Let's eat together.

483
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,253
Why, with you?

484
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:39,048
My daughter wants to have her.

485
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:44,262
You must learn that there are things
in this world you can't buy with money.

486
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,930
Stop being a smart ass!

487
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:48,349
I am holding a golf club!

488
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,143
I am holding one, too.

489
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,396
And it's my turn.

490
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,162
I got you some juice.

491
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,377
Is there something in it?

492
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,045
No way.

493
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:21,048
Jeong, taste this for me.

494
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,342
I am not getting hazard pay.

495
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,468
You drink it.

496
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,222
Mr. Director, it looks like 

497
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,934
you need to look alive to stay
in the inheritance scheme.

498
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,770
Oneair's head Kang went

499
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:38,983
to the breakfast meeting
hosted by Mr. Kim.

500
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,861
-What did you say?
-You already know.

501
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,447
The only women invited to the meeting

502
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,365
are either actresses or singers.

503
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:50,411
How amazing is this?

504
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,664
They say she said "Yes,"

505
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,792
and just smiled the whole time.

506
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:01,088
That is not easy
unless she has big ambition.

507
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,800
Even though she is a woman,
we have to learn that.

508
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:08,679
Bravo, Kang! She is so amazing.

509
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:10,931
President.

510
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,516
What?

511
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,393
You left out her title.

512
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,271
Preseident... Kang.

513
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,526
You should at least show some respect
to the owner's family,

514
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:23,986
Director Kim?

515
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:30,368
My sister is not amazed
to hear your praise.

516
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,578
Know where you stand.

517
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,462
I stopped here
because I am relatively nice.

518
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:45,216
If President Kang were here,
she would not throw juice at you.

519
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,677
She'd throw the glass at you.

520
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,438
Murder? I can't do it!

521
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,274
The sight of blood makes me pass out!

522
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,362
Then, get out of this, princess.

523
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,989
Or go and die first.

524
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,616
You are in the way.

525
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:13,494
Cell phone for #2 rings.

526
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,788
#2 gets very scared.

527
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:19,500
It must be her.
She said she would come to kill me.

528
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,377
She will kill me...

529
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,754
#3 picks up the phone with no hesitation.

530
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,924
Hello! Hello?

531
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:29,635
Speak if you called.

532
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:31,804
This isn't your phone.

533
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:34,181
Are you all here to save my trouble?

534
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,226
I'm sorry. I need to go the bathroom
so badly.

535
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:53,033
Sorry. I am sorry.

536
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,121
Shall we continue?

537
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,584
This isn't your phone.

538
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,128
Are you all here to save my trouble?

539
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:06,922
-I am--
-Director!

540
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,092
Let's wrap it up and have a drink.

541
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:11,844
Yu-ri!

542
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,141
I am just so tired.

543
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:19,059
I had so many lines.

544
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:21,479
Everyone is tired.

545
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,982
Can you please let it go?

546
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,829
Yes, bring them in.

547
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:54,386
It's not big.

548
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,264
I just wanted to make sure
everyone gets enough.

549
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:08,317
Not only do we like the same clothes,
but we also think the same.

550
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:11,403
President You!

551
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,680
Don't worry about Gging-ggang.
Take care.

552
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:40,349
Where are you staying, really?

553
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:44,853
I work for the master, and sleep in a hut,
like a slave.

554
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,773
Hey! I can buy you a house.

555
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:48,899
Are you drunk?

556
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,068
I can afford that much!

557
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,278
I have money.

558
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,738
Then deposit 100 million won
in my account.

559
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:55,781
Hey.

560
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:59,201
Then... please...

561
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:02,496
take good care of Gging-ggang.

562
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,001
She's not drunk enough.

563
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,513
One hot vanilla latte to go, please.

564
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,599
Do you have the coupon?

565
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:22,891
No.

566
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,277
-What is it?
-Because you're a good person.

567
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:37,656
Do you like dogs?
Nice people usually like dogs.

568
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:44,955
Here we have a beautiful actress.

569
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:47,291
The air is different.

570
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:50,377
-Of course!
-I am still young!

571
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:53,422
Thanks to the head
who cherishes me so much,

572
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:56,300
a new actress like me gets to be invited.

573
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,177
I truly appreciate it.

574
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,434
A lady should not pour a drink.

575
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:15,194
Who is this?

576
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,489
Aren't you Director Seo of T-Road?

577
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:21,784
What changed? After so many invites,
you finally show up.

578
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:22,868
I was close by.

579
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:26,205
And I wanted to drink for many reasons.

580
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:30,542
Of course, we need to drink
at this historical moment.

581
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:31,627
Take this.

582
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,337
I should pour you a drink.

583
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,178
That is enough.

584
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,359
What is this?

585
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:58,862
I poured the drink for someone
who will sit here next time.

586
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,031
Stop inviting me to these meetings.

587
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,535
You cannot just call and invite

588
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,371
me or President Kang.

589
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,377
I will pay for this.

590
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:19,466
-Hey, stop.
-Director Seo!

591
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:45,451
Why are you taking care
of Han Se-gye's dog?

592
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:46,952
Because she pays me.

593
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:48,871
You do anything for money.

594
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,331
Not anything. Just most things.

595
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,010
Did you invite someone, too?

596
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,887
No way. It's not my home.

597
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,680
Maybe it's your guest?

598
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:10,434
No way. I have no friends.

599
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:18,776
It's your brother.

600
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,486
Who?

601
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:21,779
Your brother.

602
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,115
I don't have a bro...

603
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,286
It's Seo Do-jae.

604
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,881
-Hide now. Hide that, too.
-Yes.

605
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,139
Ryu Eun-ho.

606
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:53,185
No matter what happens, don't come out.

607
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:56,522
Nothing would be more dangerous
than your coming out.

608
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:29,221
Are we so close that you come here
without calling?

609
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:32,099
I have to confess something.
You are free, right?

610
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,100
Speak there.

611
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:36,562
Let's go in. You might get loud.

612
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,063
I said to speak there.

613
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:42,568
It's about the breakfast meeting.

614
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,237
I took care of them for you.

615
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:46,738
What?

616
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,866
See? I knew you would yell.

617
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:56,248
Who do you think you are?

618
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,208
You are scary and disrespectful!

619
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:01,003
Why weren't you like that at the meeting?

620
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,597
PRESIDENT KIM

621
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,723
Just great.

622
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:21,106
What did you tell your brother
to make him act like that?

623
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:23,442
I thought you were better than that.

624
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:26,194
You are a wuss
to tell your brother everything.

625
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,531
You have a happy life, right?

626
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,325
You probably need nothing.

627
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:32,868
Do you know why?

628
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,746
You are ignorant and didn't learn.

629
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:38,957
-What?
-Hide that you did not learn.

630
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,084
Aren't you ashamed?

631
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,713
Indeed, you should know something
about shame.

632
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:45,797
Hey you!

633
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:48,884
So loud. Maybe a dog is barking.

634
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:51,136
Why is a dog talking to a human?

635
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:53,805
Did you see?

636
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:56,475
I must put up with this because
you intervened.

637
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:59,436
I didn't do it because I couldn't.

638
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,563
I know you are good at it.

639
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,608
So do what you are good at.

640
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:08,528
I can't see you lose to someone.

641
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,949
Funny. What do you think you are?

642
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:14,117
Me? I am your brother.

643
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,207
Since when?

644
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:25,087
I think... I became your brother about
ten years ago.

645
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:39,935
Do you have a dog?

646
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:44,022
What are you talking about?
I don't like dogs.

647
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,110
I was just coughing.

648
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,280
Is somebody in there?

649
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:54,866
No.

650
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,539
Why do you keep blocking me?

651
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:02,791
Do you think I always block you?

652
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:03,959
You are delusional!

653
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:09,464
Do you even know what you are saying?

654
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:12,009
No, I am tired. Just go.

655
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:15,512
You can thank me when you have no guest.

656
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:18,515
No one is here and I don't thank you.

657
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:20,100
Introduce me later.

658
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,768
He seems to have a dog.

659
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,854
No one is here!

660
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:48,420
Sorry.

661
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:59,181
Are you raising me like a cow?

662
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:05,270
I can't believe my weakness is the maid.

663
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:09,191
I am ruining the moment.

664
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:11,359
I am sorry.

665
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,780
Have you eaten anything?

666
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:18,116
I did not see you eating.

667
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,244
I'm a little on edge with the reading.

668
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,705
I can't really eat.

669
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,042
Just like in the past.

670
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:30,879
People said you changed,
but that was not true.

671
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:35,592
You did not make excuses
back then, either.

672
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,346
You chose to be bad.

673
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:46,895
I know you are falsely accused
and I feel sad.

674
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:52,234
It's OK. I am used to it now.

675
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:53,985
I am fine.

676
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,656
That's not something you get used to.

677
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,867
You don't become fine with it either.

678
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:03,954
Because there's nothing I can do.

679
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:10,085
You said you killed her
because you sympathized with her,

680
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:12,504
before.

681
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,385
Do you kill her when you feel sympathy?

682
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:21,138
It can be unconditional
as she truly sympathizes.

683
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:24,432
Can't you sympathize with yourself?

684
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:26,351
Why?

685
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,312
Are you afraid of killing yourself?

686
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:33,275
You could kill out of sympathy,

687
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:37,154
but you could also hug... out of sympathy.

688
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:41,408
Life is not like a movie.

689
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:46,705
So, just hug yourself.

690
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:51,626
Or it's good to have someone
who can hug you like that.

691
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,675
Walk a bit before coming in.

692
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:01,428
The stars are beautiful.

693
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:12,105
It looks like
they are all trying to comfort me.

694
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:24,826
Someone to hug me.

695
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:29,789
Someone...

696
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,377
who understands me.

697
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:49,809
Soju is sweet when I drink it with you.

698
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,937
Drink with me, too.

699
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,689
Can I take a little break?

700
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,442
I've been drinking too much.

701
00:53:58,026 --> 00:53:59,861
I will take a break just once!

702
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,529
OK, fine.

703
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:05,742
Then, drink in a pretty way.

704
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,202
What?

705
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:09,746
There is a drinking scene.

706
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:11,248
Practice drinking here.

707
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,876
How can I do it suddenly?

708
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,254
Why? Don't you want to?

709
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:21,299
No... you are ruining the moment...

710
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:23,718
for drinking.

711
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:24,886
This is wrong.

712
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,639
I didn't say I wouldn't. I will do it.

713
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:30,392
I won't drink from a glass,

714
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,478
but from the bottle.

715
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:35,814
Alright!

716
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,692
Bite your lip in a sexy way.

717
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,989
Do it. Good!

718
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,824
Drink it. Drink.

719
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:47,158
So sexy!

720
00:54:57,252 --> 00:55:00,171
If you want to keep doing this,
I will play her part.

721
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:17,689
That soju was strong.

722
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:28,116
MOM

723
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:33,121
What's up?

724
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:35,290
I saw your interview.

725
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,084
You two look so good together.

726
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:41,796
Was his picture touched up?
Or does he really look like that?

727
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:46,134
Mom.

728
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,595
You have a drunk slur.

729
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:51,181
You drank, didn't you?

730
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:53,016
Mom.

731
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,020
What was it like dating Dad?

732
00:55:58,271 --> 00:56:00,648
Why do you suddenly bring him up?

733
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:03,151
Tell me about how you two dated.

734
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:04,402
Your dad?

735
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:09,157
There was nothing special.

736
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,410
He suddenly appeared
and he was suddenly nice to me.

737
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:17,624
He suddenly made me love him,
and then suddenly left.

738
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,709
He was bad.

739
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:22,462
Why did he suddenly appear

740
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,091
and suddenly be nice?

741
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:29,177
Right?

742
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:30,929
Speaking of being bad,

743
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:35,600
Suddenly making me love him
and suddenly leaving is worse.

744
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:36,935
You are right.

745
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:41,398
Why? Did you fight with him?

746
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:45,568
No, I was just wondering how
other people handle their relationships.

747
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:48,530
I was curious.

748
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,281
What about you?

749
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,034
It just...

750
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:57,247
makes me feel happy.

751
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,126
Very...

752
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,338
much like real.

753
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:06,464
I know.

754
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:11,136
You must feel things in the past are fake.
Only what you feel is real.

755
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,847
You must have met the right one.

756
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:18,643
I have to go.

757
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:21,604
Eat some hangover soup tomorrow.

758
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,481
Say hi to your boyfriend.

759
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,066
OK.

760
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:40,206
Thinking about him upsets me!

761
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:42,041
Why do I have to be like this?

762
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,275
Why haven't you been calling? Why?

763
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:10,153
You said you would work today.

764
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,946
You still should have called.

765
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,782
If I don't pick up,
you should keep trying.

766
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:17,827
Why do you make me call you?

767
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:18,912
Han Se-gye,

768
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,873
did you drink again?

769
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:23,249
You are so annoying.

770
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:26,085
Why did you suddenly appear?

771
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:28,922
Why did you suddenly act kind?

772
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:30,882
Where are you now?

773
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:34,552
Why? Will you come here?

774
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:36,971
I...

775
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:41,017
I also want you to show up

776
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,228
right in front of me, but...

777
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,234
I quit.

778
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,530
I want to quit.

779
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:59,786
I feel so dumb. I hate myself like this.

780
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:06,501
Han Se-gye?

781
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:10,255
Han Se-gye?

782
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:13,216
What do you think you are?

783
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:20,014
Let's talk later.

784
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,266
Why do you intervene?

785
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:23,351
Why do you help me like that?

786
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:28,106
Did you just hit me?

787
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,693
Yes, I did. So what?

788
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:33,695
Can't I?

789
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:36,739
Wow. Just because there is
no one around...

790
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:43,913
So, did you like what they did to you?

791
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:45,957
It didn't look that way.

792
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:50,336
Yes. I liked it.

793
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,757
If you take that kind of disrespect,

794
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:58,678
and let it go,
others have to suffer a lot more.

795
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:02,223
If the main character takes everything
like 20 times,

796
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,309
how rude will they be to the others?

797
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:05,602
Why do I care?

798
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:06,686
UNCLE

799
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,146
Mind your own business.

800
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:10,106
You just got a supporting role.

801
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:15,445
Let's just say you don't like me

802
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:16,404
and stop this.

803
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:18,364
Why do I not like you?

804
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:21,075
You're not good enough to be hated.

805
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,619
You don't show up on time.

806
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:24,621
You run from the shooting.

807
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:27,248
You date anyone.

808
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:29,208
Those are not my problems.

809
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:31,210
Those are your problems.

810
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:34,881
Let's stop. Later...

811
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:38,968
Why? Your rich boyfriend took you
to the top of the world?

812
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,055
You are so naive.

813
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,308
Who would like a woman like you?

814
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:47,935
Don't you know?

815
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:52,023
He is just playing you.

816
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:59,030
What is this? Are you acting?

817
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:02,450
Han Se-gye.

818
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:09,582
Han Se-gye!

819
01:01:16,297 --> 01:01:17,382
Han Se-gye.

820
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:20,677
Han Se-gye!

821
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:26,307
Help. Help here!

822
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:43,908
Se-gye!

823
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:46,035
Are you OK?

824
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:48,329
Why am I...

825
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:49,956
You crazy!

826
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,583
You passed out because you didn't eat.

827
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:55,253
You chugged on an empty stomach.

828
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,214
Sorry.

829
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,217
I must have scared you.

830
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:16,482
Why is he...

831
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,110
You didn't pick up the phone,
so he called me.

832
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,321
I was so worried...

833
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,283
Se-gye.

834
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:26,909
Se-gye.

835
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:30,246
I will go.

836
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,134
Han Se-gye.

837
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,011
That's not me.

838
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:46,471
It is.

839
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:51,434
You don't recognize me when you have to.

840
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,479
You recognize me when you shouldn't.

841
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:57,899
You do whatever you want.

842
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:02,445
I certainly told you not to run away.

843
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,744
Let's terminate the contract.

844
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:15,458
Let's end the confidentiality
and relationship agreements now.

845
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:18,211
Understood.

846
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,804
Send the news to the media

847
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:29,764
that we broke up.

848
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:37,188
Is it good now?

849
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:40,566
Why kiss me,
if you were going to act like this?

850
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,235
That's what I wanted to ask.

851
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:45,696
Are you dumb? Do you really know nothing?

852
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:46,614
I don't.

853
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,449
I am not used to this.

854
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:53,412
I can't get used to

855
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:57,333
seeing invisible things.

856
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:02,505
And I hate myself for being like this.

857
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:09,220
I have't loved myself since that day.

858
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:11,138
Not even once.

859
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:18,980
When a woman asks if there is anything
to say after a kiss,

860
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:20,398
there are two answers.

861
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:25,361
Either "I love you" or "Sorry."

862
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:30,116
I don't want to say "Sorry,"

863
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:33,619
which leaves one answer.

864
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:38,040
That is why I couldn't say anything.

865
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:43,880
How can I say that

866
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:48,676
when I am such a mess?

867
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:55,600
Say it.

868
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,146
Just say it.

869
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:02,899
I am a mess, too.

870
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:12,491
If we name this feeling,

871
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,953
things will be out of control.

872
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:19,707
You won't be able to forget
for a long time.

873
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:23,628
I can't anyway,

874
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:27,048
even after my death.

875
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:31,802
Because you are the one who recognized me.

876
01:05:39,977 --> 01:05:41,312
Will you be OK

877
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:43,522
with me?

878
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:47,693
Do you mean it?

879
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:49,904
I do.

880
01:05:51,405 --> 01:05:52,657
I can't believe it.

881
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:56,869
Prove it.

882
01:07:12,486 --> 01:07:14,697
