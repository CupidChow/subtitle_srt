Episode 16

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
People say that his father is a superman.

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,000
But my father is an alien.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
He always said that the universe is limitless and that humans are tiny.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So we have to face this world with ease.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But he forgot to tell me that there are humans in this world.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Humans are very complicated.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Chen Le Le, why didn't your mother come to the festival today?

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
My mother went abroad. My father said he would come.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Your father didn't come either. You think this is a festival?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's none of your business. Your mother went abroad because she didn't want you.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Has your mother hit you?

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Why are you asking?

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
My mother hasn't hit my father either.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That's because they don't want you. My mother said she would hit you if she loves you.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Chen Le Le, why did you hit me?

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes, Chen Le Le, why did you hit me? I'm telling you.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I wanted to tell my mother.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Le Le.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Le Le, you're not here.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What a pity.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I ran so far to buy this colourful bicycle for her.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Who is this?

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Le Le.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Look at this light. I bought it from a Thai shop. I can light it myself.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I heard that someone hit you at school today.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It wasn't that. It was a bullet.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
A bullet? Where did it hit you? Where did you get hurt?

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I didn't, but it was very painful.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You're so good at taking time.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I just got a call from the teacher.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Did you forget that you were coming to the festival today?

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What festival?

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Nothing.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You've been listening to your mother.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
She told me that you didn't eat well.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You came home late at night, right?

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Can you not send me away?

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm not sending you away.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm just worried that no one will take care of you.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I can take care of myself.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But don't send me to my neighbour's house again.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Can you?

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Okay.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Let's go.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Let's go.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Let's go.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm so happy to be here.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm so happy to be here.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm so happy to be here.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm so happy to be here.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm so happy to be here.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm so happy to be here.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm so happy to be here.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm so happy to be here.

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm so happy to be here.

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm so happy to be here.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm so happy to be here.

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm so happy to be here.

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm so happy to be here.

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm so happy to be here.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,440
Welcome the new benefits

64
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,440
of performing all along the zither.

65
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,440
And tell us if you like it or not.

66
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,560
Miss Liu,

67
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,280
why aren't you coming down?

68
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,080
Oh I have to perform a candle dance.

69
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,020
The toilet is over there.

70
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,980
Let someone to wash the followers out.

71
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,980
Alright, put the fork in front of the doors.

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Our bars are larger.

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Make it available before the nesseN times show.

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,800
Miss, the bathroom is the same.

75
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
I just talked about the bathroom.

76
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
Yes.

77
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,300
Miss, is the bathroom clean?

78
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,500
Yes, it's very clean.

79
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,000
Really?

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,500
Yes.

81
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,000
Sorry.

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
No, no, no.

83
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,000
Miss, is there a lot of bathrooms?

84
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
Yes, there are.

85
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,500
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Or you can take me to the bathroom.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
No, no, no.

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Bye.

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What do you think he's doing today?

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The pregnant woman is the best.

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
He's taking it slow.

93
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,000
But he's already taking it slow when he's not pregnant.

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So what if he's pregnant?

95
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,000
He's busier than usual.

96
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,500
I don't know what he's doing.

97
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,000
You're saying this to me, right?

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
If you're not happy, you should say it.

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Who is it that will take the old lady to the funeral?

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,500
If the money is useless,

101
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
I'll send it to you this morning.

102
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Don't underestimate the potential of the grandparents.

103
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,000
When you treat them well,

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,500
they'll take you to the funeral.

105
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,500
That's a good idea.

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Help me.

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Sorry.

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The pregnancy is taking so slow.

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,500
That bag is for you.

110
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,500
The bag is for Le Le.

111
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,500
The pregnancy is slow.

112
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,000
I can't even speak.

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Really.

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,500
Let's go somewhere else next month.

115
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,000
Why?

116
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I have to do the dishes.

117
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Because you can't take the baby here.

118
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Think about yourself first.

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,500
Think about the moon, the face, and the spa.

120
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,000
Think about men when you're married.

121
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You'll still think about the baby before you're born.

122
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Who's like you?

123
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,500
You only think about yourself.

124
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,500
I'm doing this to take care of myself

125
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
is the biggest contribution to the world, okay?

126
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,000
It's best to be old, but it doesn't hurt.

127
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's better to be born early.

128
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,500
Who was it at first?

129
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,500
Who was the one who said he was going to marry a rich man and become a rich woman?

130
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,500
Don't say that to me.

131
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,500
Who was the one who said he was going to be a tour guide to America?

132
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
You two are really noisy.

133
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,500
Who was it that really wanted to be a tour guide when he was young?

134
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,500
I want to be the tour guide.

135
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,500
What do you want to do?

136
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,500
I don't know. I don't know.

137
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,500
Forget it.

138
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,500
You're going to America.

139
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,500
I'm looking for you.

140
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
We're looking for your mom.

141
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
I can't continue.

142
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Why isn't anyone asking for my tour guide?

143
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
You still want to ask?

144
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
We want you to be more stable,

145
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
not to be like you when you eat and act like you are.

146
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,500
You're saying my name is a tour guide?

147
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,500
Yes, yes.

148
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,500
It's because they had more people staying last night.

149
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
We have a room.

150
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Is that our problem?

151
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Then why are you bothering me?

152
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm going to buy something.

153
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'll buy you a coffee first, okay?

154
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
No, I'm not angry with you.

155
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm not angry.

156
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm just waiting too long.

157
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And let me remind you.

158
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Isn't it time for us to go out?

159
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm going to buy something.

160
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Then who will pay for the time?

161
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'll pay for it myself.

162
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Can you massage your mom?

163
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Wait until the flower is in bloom.

164
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Why does she have to massage? I'm also very sad.

165
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,500
Brother, didn't you just talk to me?

166
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,500
No, I'm also very tired.

167
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,500
Then where are you tired?

168
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Here.

169
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
I'm so tired.

170
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Here.

171
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,500
You're making fun of me.

172
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
Brother, don't say that.

173
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,500
We're in a hotel, not a hotel.

174
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
No, you can just be joking.

175
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,500
It's okay.

176
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Wait, wait.

177
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Wait, are you scolding our guest?

178
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
No, I'm not scolding the guest.

179
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,500
Miss, what's your problem?

180
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't have any problem.

181
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm not scolding you.

182
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm trying to do my best.

183
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You can't do this.

184
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I've been patient with you for a long time.

185
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You're always sulking.

186
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You're the one we hired.

187
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I have the right to ask you to give us the highest service value.

188
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Lin Wei is here.

189
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
She hit me.

190
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Lin Wei is here.

191
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Lin Wei is here.

192
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Lin Wei is here.

193
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Lin Wei is here.

194
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Are you okay?

195
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
My heart is so painful.

196
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Are you okay?

197
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Don't touch me.

198
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Don't touch me.

199
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,500
Don't touch me.

200
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
Don't touch me.

201
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
Don't touch me.

202
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Don't touch me.

203
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Don't touch me.

204
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Don't touch me.

205
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Don't touch me.

206
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The senior management of the travel group hit people.

207
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Is it so difficult to hurt the guest's mood?

208
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You report to the media.

209
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I wasn't popular enough before.

210
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What do you want me to do with the person you introduced?

211
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Tell me.

212
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Actually, he...

213
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What?

214
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,500
Actually, I...

215
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
What?

216
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,500
If you want to stay in the company,

217
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
you go out first.

218
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,500
What did you do?

219
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,500
No, the situation of the day, the general manager,

220
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
that aunt...

221
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
If the guest wants to hit you, you hit him.

222
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
He's just a bully.

223
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,500
He's just...

224
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,500
Did he hit you?

225
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,500
He didn't.

226
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
Did you touch him?

227
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I just...

228
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I just hit him.

229
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Hit him?

230
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Then you hit him.

231
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You know the client can't be hurt.

232
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You can only respect them.

233
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Do you understand?

234
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
They are gods. They are gods.

235
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What are you?

236
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Get out.

237
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You go.

238
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Go?

239
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Go?

240
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Pack up your things.

241
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Get out.

242
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Nala.

243
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Nala.

244
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Nala.

245
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I want to say something.

246
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
This is how it should be.

247
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
With this spirit, okay?

248
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Don't let it be a one day blue.

249
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Our ZOEY's Overmind

250
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
is also open to everyone.

251
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Including those who are less experienced,

252
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
can come to the stage

253
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
to test their own performance.

254
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,500
It's your first time

255
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,500
to see us on the Togo show, right?

256
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
Many of you are here for the first time.

257
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
Too free, right?

258
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,500
Welcome.

259
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,500
Because today is Monday,

260
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
I know many people's mood.

261
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
Work.

262
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,500
One day blue.

263
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,500
So we hope that the next performer

264
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,500
can bring us some energy.

265
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,500
Let's make a good impression.

266
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,500
Because this performer

267
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,500
is also the only one in our club

268
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,500
who can easily make a good impression.

269
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
You can tell by his body.

270
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,500
Let's welcome C2.

271
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,500
Hello everyone, I'm C2.

272
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,500
Yesterday when I was going home,

273
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,000
I was waiting for the bus.

274
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,500
And besides me,

275
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,000
there was a couple waiting for the bus.

276
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,500
And suddenly, on the opposite street,

277
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
there was a guy who looked like

278
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,500
the boss of the gang.

279
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,500
He shouted at us.

280
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,500
Hey, hey, you, it's you.

281
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Wow, I felt so scary.

282
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
I bowed my head.

283
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,500
Pretending I couldn't hear.

284
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,500
And he shouted again.

285
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Hey, you, it's you, fatty.

286
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Then I turned around

287
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and looked at the couple.

288
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Because I have to know

289
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
who has the lowest BMI.

290
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
How much?

291
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You're being polite.

292
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
58.

293
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Applause.

294
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
58, who has this amount of weight?

295
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Hello, mom.

296
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,500
Oh, right.

297
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,500
It will be announced today.

298
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,500
I'm pretty sure.

299
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,000
Don't worry.

300
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,500
I'll let you know if there's any good news.

301
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,500
It's two o'clock in the morning over there.

302
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,500
Get some rest.

303
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,500
Okay, good night.

304
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,500
Stop my mother.

305
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,500
Stop my mother!

306
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,500
けど

307
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,700
스트

308
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please

309
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I can't say the show.

310
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I can't say the show.

311
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I can't say the show.

312
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
But it's fine.

313
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Anyone can say it.

314
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You can say what you want to say.

315
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
How do you call yourself?

316
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm Chen Le Le.

317
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Oh, Chen Le Le.

318
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Wow, is that your real name?

319
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yes.

320
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You just revealed your true self.

321
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What did you do?

322
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I was fired.

323
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I was fired.

324
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I know why you were fired.

325
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I tell you, the audience of the show

326
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
likes to see

327
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
people who are not good enough.

328
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
They hate people who are good enough.

329
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Come on, come up and talk.

330
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Hello, everyone.

331
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm Chen Le Le.

332
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
As I said,

333
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I was fired today.

334
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Before I left the company,

335
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I went to the HR department.

336
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The HR department

337
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
was in charge of the HR department.

338
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I was fired.

339
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I was fired.

340
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I was fired.

341
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I was fired.

342
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I was fired.

343
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
The HR department told me

344
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
that I didn't do my job well.

345
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I said, yes.

346
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I haven't done my job well

347
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
for several years.

348
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Now I realize

349
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
that I didn't do my job well either.

350
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I was serious

351
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
and only fired twice.

352
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The first time was

353
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
when I was fired by the national treasure.

354
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The reason why I was fired

355
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
was because I apologized too often.

356
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Chen Le Le,

357
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
why did you apologize so often?

358
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

359
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm sorry.

360
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I didn't mean to.

361
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You're still here.

362
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm really sorry.

363
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You can't apologize.

364
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Get your beauty out of your body.

365
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Fuck you.

366
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'll apologize if you ask me to.

367
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What do you think you are?

368
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Fuck you.

369
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
Hey.

370
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,700
Le Le, I'm sorry.

371
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,700
I put you to sleep right away.

372
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,860
I was worried that we couldn't do this.

373
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,660
It's okay.

374
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,500
Le Le is not young anymore.

375
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,840
Can we go look for an outsider?

376
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,620
After you're pregnant,

377
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,620
please go to bed early.

378
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,820
I'll just sleep.

379
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,020
Okay. If there's any news, let us know.

380
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,220
Okay.

381
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,820
You can rest now. Good night.

382
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,720
The reason I got fired for the second time was because

383
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,520
I was too unwilling to say sorry.

384
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,220
I received some complaints.

385
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,020
I even got on the news and the newspaper.

386
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:31,340
Especially when you know that Taiwan is a place full of hidden

387
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,740
But your child is already 35 years old.

388
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:39,340
Is there any good food in this restaurant that can be refunded?

389
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:45,140
Why was the tour guide prettier last year?

390
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,740
Wow, we're not making any money.

391
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,740
It's a loss of mental energy.

392
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,940
It's normal for me to eat tofu in this industry.

393
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,740
You know, it's like eating and drinking water.

394
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,740
But I saw my friend that day.

395
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,140
When he was eating tofu,

396
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:07,540
the thread broke like this.

397
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,540
I was told that I hit people.

398
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:14,940
No, how could I hit people?

399
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,740
I don't mix with gangsters anymore.

400
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,740
I'm so miserable.

401
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,140
Right?

402
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:31,140
I think the saddest thing is that

403
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,340
when my friend fired me,

404
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,340
he was standing next to me.

405
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,540
He's my best friend.

406
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,840
It's so good that we even came to the concert together.

407
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,740
But the best friend is

408
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,140
he should help me fight for my life.

409
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,340
But he can't do anything.

410
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,540
Bitch.

411
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,440
He's not a bitch.

412
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,340
But forget it.

413
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,140
I know it from the bottom of my heart.

414
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,340
I'm a few years old.

415
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,540
How can I believe this?

416
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,340
But I think today

417
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,340
I really feel like I'm betrayed by the whole world.

418
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,140
As a social worker, I know it's helpless.

419
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,940
But at least I think

420
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,140
he can keep me for a while.

421
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,140
For example,

422
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,940
he hugged me.

423
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,740
Then I told the general manager,

424
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,340
I helped the general manager.

425
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,340
After Cheng Lele finished the fight,

426
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,740
he would silently help Xiao Qiang.

427
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,540
He was reading the scriptures,

428
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,540
reading the Taoist scriptures, and Amitabha.

429
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,940
How could he hit people?

430
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,540
I'm so happy.

431
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,740
The number you have dialed is not available.

432
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,740
The number you have dialed is not available.

433
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,540
The number you have dialed is not available.

434
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,240
I need to drink.

435
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,340
That's great.

436
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,540
ocking.

437
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,540
Cheng Lele.

438
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,660
Oh, hello.

439
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,980
Are you still interested in coming back to talk show?

440
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,220
I'm sorry. I was being serious.

441
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,900
You have a lot of potential.

442
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,140
Me?

443
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:08,540
I'm just a loser who got fired and got drunk during the middle age crisis.

444
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,100
That's great.

445
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,340
I feel like there are a lot of things to say.

446
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:17,980
The more miserable people are, the more they are suitable to talk about.

447
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,820
We need people with stories.

448
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,940
Especially women.

449
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,060
I'm sorry.

450
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,420
Are you following me?

451
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,620
No, no, no.

452
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,220
I'm sorry. I thought someone was following me.

453
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,700
I'm sorry. I scared you.

454
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,380
To be honest, I'm really following you.

455
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,820
Don't misunderstand. I'm the audience just now.

456
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,500
Okay.

457
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:18,940
I... I just wanted to say thank you.

458
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,100
Thank you for what?

459
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:28,780
Thank you for making me feel happier tonight.

460
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:37,700
You're welcome. I'm happy too.

461
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,020
It's fun. Do you often say that here?

462
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,940
No, no. This is the first time.

463
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,860
Yes, I'm too drunk.

464
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,020
I can't tell. No, it's fun. You have a lot of talent.

465
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,780
Thank you.

466
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,900
It makes me happy.

467
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,940
I was a little upset today.

468
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,300
It's okay.

469
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,660
You're not from the fraud group, are you?

470
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,460
I am.

471
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,420
I want to get on with my work.

472
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,100
Do you want watermelons?

473
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,980
Good, we don't want it.

474
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,460
It's game time. Come on eat, come on.

475
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,940
Watermelon.

476
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,980
Who do you want to take?

477
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,980
You're not going to the game?

478
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,980
No, I'm not going.

479
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,980
Why are you still awake?

480
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,980
I told you not to wait for me.

481
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,980
I'm watching the game.

482
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,980
Are you watching me or preparing to watch?

483
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,980
Why would I watch the second game?

484
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,980
I'm going to sleep.

485
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,980
I'm going to sleep.

486
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,980
What are you doing?

487
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,980
I thought you were going to drink milk

488
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,980
when you were hungry.

489
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,980
Are you crazy?

490
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,980
This is my little thing.

491
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,980
I'm so confused.

492
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,980
I really need to get some fresh air.

493
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,980
What are you going to do?

494
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,980
Next month, the schedule is 7,000 a week.

495
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,980
That accurate?

496
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,980
I need to ask for leave.

497
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,980
I asked Le Le to ask me for the ticket discount.

498
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,980
I don't know if she got it.

499
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,980
Are you a fool?

500
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,980
Why are you like this?

501
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,980
We're good friends.

502
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,980
Just tell her.

503
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,980
Don't tell her.

504
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,980
She's always the one who gets mad.

505
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,980
Just tell her the truth.

506
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,980
It's like forcing her to be your guide.

507
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,980
I've been covering for her.

508
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,980
I'm the one covering for her.

509
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,980
Okay, don't be mad.

510
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,980
Let's order.

511
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,980
I don't want to eat.

512
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,980
You're crazy.

513
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,980
I decided to eat a plate of pickled pork and sweet potatoes

514
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,980
by myself today.

515
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,980
I want to eat two bites.

516
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,980
No, you order it yourself.

517
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,980
Every time, you're like this.

518
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,980
Le Le's food is half as delicious as you.

519
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,980
Yes.

520
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,980
Mo Mo, I want a rice ball with ice cream,

521
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,980
three pieces of beef, fried chicken, and a beer.

522
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,980
Okay.

523
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,980
So, it's not about the action.

524
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,980
It's not my problem.

525
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,980
But it's a little bit...

526
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,980
I think we need this.

527
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,980
So, we can definitely talk about the price.

528
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,980
Miss Chen, we really can't use you

529
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,980
for these things.

530
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,980
Sister Shih Kuei,

531
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,980
the first day,

532
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,980
you only went to Qing Mai Tower

533
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,980
to take pictures with us.

534
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,980
It's boring.

535
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,980
What do you think is more interesting?

536
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,980
I'll go to the bathroom first.

537
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,980
I'm going to the bathroom.

538
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,980
Ke magn volcanoes

539
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,980
In這裡

540
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,980
In speciallyae

541
00:27:41,980 --> 00:28:00,980
ha

542
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,980
down

543
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,980
You can put it in and straight up.

544
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:04,980
And up.

545
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,980
Dingord Nicam

546
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,980
This is my present situation.

547
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,780
If you have any questions, just ask me.

548
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,980
Okay, thanks for the call.

549
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,980
Please come over.

550
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,980
You finally answered my call. I'm so worried.

551
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,980
Listen to me.

552
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,980
Fang Shu-fei is a strong personality.

553
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,980
I don't need any rational analysis.

554
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:47,980
I'm going to work now.

555
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,980
No, no, no. Listen to me.

556
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,980
No, no, no.

557
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,980
Hey.

558
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,980
This is a new work of art.

559
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,980
I don't need any rational analysis.

560
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,980
Are you okay?

561
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,980
Do you need any help?

562
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,980
Are you okay?

563
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,980
I'm fine.

564
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,980
Do you need any help?

565
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,980
You have really bad eyes.

566
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,980
You're going to have a baby.

567
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,980
Huh?

568
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,980
Do you want to sit down?

569
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,980
Yes, after my first wedding is two weeks away.

570
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,980
Be careful.

571
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,980
I can actually come by myself.

572
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,980
I'm fine.

573
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,980
Don't be nervous.

574
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,980
Don't be nervous.

575
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,980
I'm not nervous. You guys don't have to be nervous.

576
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,980
I'll be right there. Don't worry.

577
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,980
Miss, this is your wedding.

578
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,980
Congratulations.

579
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,980
You have to be with my family.

580
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,980
I'll call you later.

581
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,980
My husband is in Taiwan.

582
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,980
Where are the other families?

583
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,980
I don't have another husband.

584
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,980
Don't be nervous.

585
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,980
I'm not nervous.

586
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,980
What's going on?

587
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,980
Let me help you.

588
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,980
Be careful.

589
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,980
Be careful.

590
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,980
I have an emergency contact.

591
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,980
Wait.

592
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,980
I'll be right there.

593
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,980
Excuse me.

594
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,980
Who are you looking for?

595
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,980
Lin Jiayu.

596
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,980
Are you her family?

597
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,980
Sister.

598
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,980
Listen.

599
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,980
If you let us miss the process of my sister and her sister's birth,

600
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,980
I'll help you.

601
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,980
Room 710.

602
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,980
Remember to wear protective clothing.

603
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,980
What are you doing?

604
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,980
What are you doing?

605
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,980
Be careful.

606
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,980
Be careful.

607
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,980
Why is my father useless?

608
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,980
Why is my leg hurting?

609
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,980
He's not here.

610
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,980
I forgot to wash my hair.

611
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,980
I was about to break my jaw.

612
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,980
I forgot to wash my hair.

613
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,980
You're worried about this now.

614
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,980
It hurts.

615
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,980
It's about to give birth.

616
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,980
I'm afraid it'll come back.

617
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,980
My wife will miss you forever.

618
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,980
I'll be by your side.

619
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,980
There are massage machines nearby.

620
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,980
I'll help you.

621
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,980
Harder.

622
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,980
I'll do it.

623
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,980
Why are you waiting for someone to show up?

624
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,980
I miss you so much.

625
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,980
Don't you?

626
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,980
I'm so worried about you two.

627
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,980
I...

628
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,980
I can see your head.

629
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,980
I can see your head.

630
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,980
Are you okay?

631
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,980
Okay.

632
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,980
Oh my god.

633
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,980
Me.

634
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,980
Your usually the one eating.

635
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,980
It's so scary to have children.

636
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,980
Oh.

637
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,980
You carp that we saw children come out from the gym.

638
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,980
I'm sorry.

639
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,980
But I don't feel sorry.

640
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,980
When you were fired, I was actually happy for you.

641
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,980
You don't like that job.

642
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,980
I know.

643
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,980
It's just that I've been in this profession for so long.

644
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,980
Suddenly I realized that

645
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,980
I didn't have the talent to do that job.

646
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,980
I'm so mediocre.

647
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,980
I need a little bit of mental construction.

648
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,980
So am I really not suitable to be a leader and a tour guide?

649
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,980
You don't have the talent.

650
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,980
Okay.

651
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,980
So, how to be a good actor?

652
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,980
How did you know?

653
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,980
Please, I know your dad.

654
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,980
He's always so experienced.

655
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,980
I didn't expect to be able to say it on stage.

656
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,980
That's because you always say it.

657
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,980
I don't have the chance to say it.

658
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,980
I'm not good at it.

659
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,980
I don't have the chance to say it.

660
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,980
But it's undeniable.

661
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,980
The feeling on stage is quite special.

662
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,980
As long as you don't hit the customer,

663
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,980
you can do anything.

664
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,980
Can you just have a second

665
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,980
to ask people to like you?

666
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,980
I don't need it.

667
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:20,980
I'm starting to miss you.

668
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,980
I don't need to talk to you anymore.

669
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,980
Brother Rui.

670
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,980
Coming.

671
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,980
What does it mean?

672
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,980
Huang Su Fei, don't challenge the limit of human beings.

673
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,980
It's okay. Tell me.

674
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,980
It's already my greatest consideration.

675
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,980
No, it looks cute.

676
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,980
You're always being disturbed by Taipei's fashion.

677
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,980
Little baby is cute when he's not noisy.

678
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,980
Yes.

679
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,980
How is it?

680
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,980
Sha Sha, these two are my best friends.

681
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,980
This is Aunt Su Fei.

682
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,980
This is Aunt Luna.

683
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,980
Aunt Lai Yu, Mom, it's time to rest.

684
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,980
Let's take the baby back to the baby room.

685
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,980
Let's take the baby back to the baby room.

686
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,980
Okay.

687
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,980
Let's go back to the baby room.

688
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,980
I miss you so much.

689
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,980
Brother Rui.

690
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,980
What day is it today?

691
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,980
No, what day is it today?

692
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,980
It's January 20th.

693
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,980
Are you scared?

694
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,980
My dad's birthday.

695
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,980
Nowadays, people who have kids

696
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,980
are very careful about their kids.

697
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,980
I'll remind him of my son's birthday in the future.

698
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,980
It's okay, I'm just a kid.

699
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,980
I don't want to do this.

700
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,980
I'll do it.

701
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,980
I'm sorry.

702
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,980
I'm sorry.

703
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,980
I'm sorry.

704
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,980
I'm sorry.

705
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,980
I'm sorry.

706
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,980
I'm sorry to hear that.

707
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,980
I'm so sorry.

708
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,980
I'm sorry.

709
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,980
I'm sorry.

710
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,980
I'm sorry.

711
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,980
I'm sorry.

712
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,980
You're up late. You have to go home and feed the cat.

713
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,980
You're raising a cat?

714
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,980
Because you know why?

715
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,980
When the cat is angry, it will only meow.

716
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,980
But when the friend is...

717
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:35,980
Go home and feed the cat later.

718
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,980
Stay with me for a while.

719
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,980
Can you go home and feed the cat later?

720
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,980
Hurry up.

721
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,980
Okay, okay. You can rest now.

722
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,980
We'll go home first.

723
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,980
When did you arrive at my office?

724
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,980
He's already on the plane. He'll be here later.

725
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,980
But my wife will be here soon.

726
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,980
Then you'll be out in a minute.

727
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,980
Husband's life is like he's going to die.

728
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:00,980
Right now, the most important man in my life is only Liu Sao.

729
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,980
Me too.

730
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,980
The most important man in my life is my Mimi.

731
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,980
Woman, what a wonderful life.

732
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,980
Okay, let's go.

733
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,980
Wait a minute.

734
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,980
What?

735
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,980
What?

736
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,980
What do you mean?

737
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,980
Don't characteristic like a właśnie?

738
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,980
