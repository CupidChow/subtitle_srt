1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
to get Paso the new boyfriend.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,840
Put your pants on.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,860
Marry to learn.

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,780
Here comes the new boyfriend piece.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,140
Then,

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,500
you're married.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,460
If someone had announced this,

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,320
you would realize that

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,100
it's her happiest moment

10
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,360
when she makes her boyfriend the boyfriend.

11
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,560
She has her own motivation,

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,420
Exploiting sounds.

13
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,900
That's what I do...

14
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,600
See?

15
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,640
which is like if we watch the same movie THE HIGH UNIT

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,460
He complains about it with me

17
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,460
And I agree

18
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,000
But on the other hand, or talking guys

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,280
You would feel that he might have a tragic thing

20
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,280
I finally know what is it called

21
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,020
Being single

22
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,520
OK, OK

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,520
Why that area for more resting time?

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,520
I am so sleepy

25
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,320
There is a VIP audience

26
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:17,020
lista

27
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,420
yes

28
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,120
20

29
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,040
Reverend

30
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,320
Oh, you waited for so long.

31
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,720
I'm satisfied.

32
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,720
Le Tong.

33
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,560
I really can't do anything.

34
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,360
Every time I ask Le Le to eat, she's always playing hide and seek with me.

35
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,080
It's hard to say that she's going to make egg rice cake.

36
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,440
Is it that hard to cook?

37
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,600
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,580
Le Le's personality is a bit more...

39
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,580
unruly.

40
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,960
Just like mom.

41
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,840
You're so naughty.

42
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,160
It's fine.

43
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,960
I'll put the key on her now.

44
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,080
She can come back on her own.

45
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
Le Tai, thank you for taking care of her.

46
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,680
Oh, it's nothing.

47
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,600
Little bird.

48
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,880
Le Le's so small, I can see her grow up.

49
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,920
How long are you going to run away from her?

50
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,960
I haven't paid the rent yet.

51
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,480
I want to save some money.

52
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,600
Let Le Le live a bit better.

53
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,000
But Le Le is a girl.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,960
She'll get married when she grows up.

55
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,040
When you're alone, who's going to take care of you?

56
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,280
You're an old man.

57
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,400
Le Tai, you're thinking too far ahead.

58
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,040
I'm old, I can take care of myself.

59
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,760
We can rent this house to the next one.

60
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,560
Then I'll have money to support myself.

61
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,080
But isn't it weird to rent it out after you pay the rent?

62
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,000
You should spend more time at home.

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,520
It's only once when the child grows up.

64
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,640
No!

65
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,640
Stop.

66
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,720
I'm back.

67
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,440
Where's the person?

68
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,680
Uncle Tang, are you home?

69
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,000
Le Le.

70
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,920
Who's the girl?

71
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,560
Who's the girl?

72
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,520
I'm home, Le Le.

73
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,520
Are you full?

74
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,240
I'm not hungry. I'm going back to my room.

75
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,200
I'm going to prepare dinner.

76
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,240
Okay, be good.

77
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,080
It's normal that your daughter doesn't like you.

78
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,040
Le Le likes me.

79
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,560
What?

80
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,520
What are you doing?

81
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,320
Hi, it's from my name is Chen Le Le.

82
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,640
I'm going to show with you today.

83
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,680
What's my dream is?

84
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,520
My big dream is to go to America one day.

85
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,760
I'm going to...

86
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,440
Do you want me to cheer you up?

87
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,880
Please, don't.

88
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,480
Hey.

89
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,560
With my support, I'll have good luck.

90
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,560
You can't do anything you don't want to do.

91
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,560
Who's that Aunt Amy?

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,200
It's Aunt Sammy.

93
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,040
Where's that Aunt Yoyo?

94
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,160
They're all like that Auntie Liu.

95
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,400
They're just friends.

96
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,680
Just friends?

97
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,360
I'm so bad at English.

98
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,280
Hey, I can hear you.

99
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,640
I'm so sorry.

100
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,040
I'm so sorry, Aunt Amy.

101
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,880
Hi, it's from my name is Chen Le Le.

102
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,600
I'm going to show with you today.

103
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
What's my dream is?

104
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,200
My big dream is to go to America one day.

105
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,040
There is someone I really want to see.

106
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,240
Le Le!

107
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,800
Le Le, dinner time!

108
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,800
I have to tell you. When he's not around, you have to go to Mom Liu's house for dinner.

109
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
I'm already full.

110
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,800
I'll go to your house to sleep after I finish my homework.

111
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
I'll go to your house to sleep after I finish my homework.

112
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
I'm going to sleep.

113
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Did you have a good night?

114
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Very very energetic.

115
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,800
Let me ask you a question.

116
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Is the audience here a mom?

117
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Is the audience here a mom?

118
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
No.

119
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,800
I think so.

120
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,800
Which mom has the time to watch the show?

121
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,800
I don't have a child yet.

122
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,800
But my good sister has.

123
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,800
Her son is the first baby I've ever seen in my life.

124
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,800
I was really scared when I saw him.

125
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,800
I have to say,

126
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,800
a newborn child

127
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,800
is really cute.

128
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
But when I saw his son from the hospital,

129
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,800
I was really touched.

130
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
I was really touched.

131
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
I was really touched.

132
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,800
I was really touched.

133
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
He's purple.

134
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
He's all wrinkled.

135
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,800
I thought, where did this alien creature come from?

136
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,800
I really wanted to say hello to him.

137
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,800
I really wanted to say hello to him.

138
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
I really wanted to say hello to him.

139
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,800
Welcome.

140
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,800
Welcome to the earth.

141
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Congratulations on your birth.

142
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Congratulations on your birth.

143
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Congratulations on your birth.

144
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Happy birthday to you.

145
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
My ex

146
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
was touching me very gently on the bed.

147
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
was touching me very gently on the bed.

148
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
I said, do you want to have a baby together?

149
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
I jumped out of bed.

150
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
I said,

151
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
do you want to hear crying every day?

152
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
He said, no, the child won't cry all day.

153
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
I said, but I will.

154
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
I can cry for you now.

155
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
I don't want to have a baby.

156
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,800
Really.

157
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,800
I know you have a lot to deal with after you live separately.

158
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,800
But you're really bad.

159
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
I don't know what you're resisting.

160
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
It's rare to have a living experience.

161
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
You can curse, complain, humiliate your other half.

162
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
You can curse, complain, humiliate your other half.

163
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Why don't you use it?

164
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
At least you can capture your ex.

165
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
He's not my ex.

166
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,800
We're still talking about the divorce.

167
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
It's the same for every tea.

168
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
You have to remember him.

169
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Use his remaining value to the fullest.

170
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
I don't want to use this way to win the audience's heart.

171
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Do you have another way to win the audience's heart?

172
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,800
I was good to you

173
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
because you know how to be self-righteous.

174
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
But I tell you, you're not a newbie anymore.

175
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Your biggest problem

176
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
is that your use of words is too simple.

177
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
It doesn't hurt.

178
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,800
The audience is here to vent their anger.

179
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Not to listen to you telling stories.

180
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
But you told me that you needed a woman's story.

181
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
So I'm telling you a woman's story.

182
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
If the audience doesn't care about you,

183
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
they won't keep following you.

184
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
Every task has a stage.

185
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,800
I think I can find my own style.

186
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,800
I've seen too many people.

187
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
You're interesting.

188
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
But if you keep being self-righteous,

189
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,800
anyone can replace you.

190
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Hello?

191
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Hello, I'm sorry.

192
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
I'm looking for Chen Guangqi. I'm An Nuer.

193
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,800
Over there.

194
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,800
Thank you.

195
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Chen Guangqi,

196
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,800
you're...

197
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,800
Dad.

198
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Dad.

199
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,800
I'm sorry.

200
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,960
Prof heavilyne.

201
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,840
You're better than me after all, BlackSt einem.

202
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,240
But I have very little experience.

203
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,840
Team air core is so weak.

204
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,120
The consistent group of drones...

205
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,320
the importance of weariness for time waste.

206
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,720
That's to crop off tears and venture into trauma.

207
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,520
Every time you are near

208
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,560
Just like me

209
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,280
They long to be close to you

210
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,680
White stars fall down from the sky

211
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,280
Every time you walk by

212
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,240
Just like me

213
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,560
They long to be close to you

214
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,680
On the day that you were born

215
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,240
The angels got together

216
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,360
And decided to create a dream come true

217
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,640
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair

218
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:32,440
I'm gonna start a rise of blue

219
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,200
Let's go

220
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,720
Look at the temples

221
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,280
Married two women

222
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,120
They have which is missing

223
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,520
The old woman broke the word

224
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,240
The sky is dark

225
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,520
I remember

226
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,280
She used to be funny

227
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,120
But her eyes became red

228
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,520
Looking toward the sky

229
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,740
She held a

230
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,740
Le goes up

231
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,360
ira

232
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,760
The point, shade

233
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,200
Doesn't shine

234
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,200
I'm not here. You have to listen to me, okay?

235
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Why are you crying like this?

236
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,200
I'll be back in ten days.

237
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
Le Le!

238
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,200
Xiao Fang?

239
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Xiao Fang?

240
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
Are you still listening to me?

241
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
I'll be back in ten days.

242
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
Okay.

243
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,200
When I'm not here, you should talk to the neighbor.

244
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,200
If she wants to say hello, you don't have to talk to her.

245
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
I'm going to work.

246
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,200
Guo Qun!

247
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
What's wrong?

248
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Nothing.

249
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,200
It's okay. Don't think too much.

250
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,200
Go to sleep. I'm going to work. Bye!

251
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,200
I'm going to work.

252
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
Xiao Fang!

253
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Are you going to buy vegetables?

254
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,200
It's been a while since I saw you.

255
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,200
Le Le, little Le Le.

256
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,200
Don't cry, don't cry.

257
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,560
It's okay.

258
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,760
How many children do you have?

259
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,960
Crying will make you healthy and grow faster.

260
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,480
It's easy for kids to have a few more children.

261
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,640
Okay.

262
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,480
Let's go home and cook.

263
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,480
It's okay.

264
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,560
It would be better if you try to get out quickly.

265
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,600
Go.

266
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,620
Do you want to call it quits?

267
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,560
Yes.

268
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,780
Jiaming said...

269
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:41,460
someone is better suited to becoming a mother.

270
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,140
So I should leave?

271
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,720
Some are not very best suited to it.

272
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,060
Bye.

273
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,200
Mom's gone.

274
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,200
But whether it's suitable or not,

275
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,200
in a mother's life,

276
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,200
she's always confused and happy.

277
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Mom's gone out to play.

278
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,200
Mom!

279
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
But...

280
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,200
the mom I remember...

281
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,200
isn't happy at all.

282
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
Mom, look!

283
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,200
Mom, look!

284
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,200
Mom, look! Why aren't you looking?

285
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
I am.

286
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,200
I'm done. I'm done.

287
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200
30.

288
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,200
Lele, it's snowing.

289
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,200
Mom, where are you going?

290
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
I'm hungry.

291
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Chop the onion into small pieces.

292
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,200
After I teach you,

293
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
if you're hungry,

294
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,200
you can do it yourself.

295
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,200
Do you hear me?

296
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,200
You can put a lot of tomato paste in it.

297
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,200
But remember to mix it well.

298
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,200
Remember this.

299
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Mom, I'm hungry.

300
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
I'm hungry.

301
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
I'm hungry.

302
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
I'm hungry.

303
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,200
I'm hungry.

304
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,200
I'm hungry.

305
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
I'm hungry.

306
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
I'm hungry.

307
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
I'm hungry.

308
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
I'm hungry.

309
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
I'm hungry.

310
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
I'm hungry.

311
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,200
I'm hungry.

312
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,200
I'm hungry.

313
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,200
I'm hungry.

314
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,200
I'm hungry.

315
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,200
I'm hungry.

316
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
I'm hungry.

317
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
I'm hungry.

318
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
I'm hungry.

319
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,200
I'm hungry.

320
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
I'm hungry.

321
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
I'm hungry.

322
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,200
ıyor

323
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
I'm hungry.

324
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,200
I'm hungry.

325
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,200
I'm hungry.

326
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,600
He never left the boat.

327
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,080
I'm so sorry.

328
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,280
When I said I didn't want to Most Innocent using遠慮

329
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,040
He only left me with ease.

330
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,960
I may think he's not sincere.

331
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,120
Hello?

332
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,200
We might think that the world is going to collapse

333
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,200
But in fact, it can still be running

334
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,200
Let us breathe in

335
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Let's listen to this song together

336
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,200
Can you turn off the music, driver?

337
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Only two hours

338
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,200
The insurance company will be here

339
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,200
Hao

340
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,200
Hao, are you okay?

341
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,200
Are you okay?

342
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
I'm fine

343
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,200
We have to move fast, only two hours

344
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
Why are you in a hurry?

345
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
It's not a big deal, don't leave me

346
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
You'll lose something if you see it

347
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
That's enough

348
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,200
How do I open this door?

349
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,200
Hello, hello, you guys

350
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,200
Brother Chen

351
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,200
Ah-Qing

352
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,200
Long time no see

353
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,200
Yes

354
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
You are Fang's daughter

355
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
You look like your mother

356
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,200
Where do I look like?

357
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
I live in the next door, my name is Ah-Qing

358
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
I'll open this door for you

359
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,200
This door is stuck

360
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
When you open it, you have to use a little skill

361
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
Slightly squeeze up

362
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,200
This is how you open it

363
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,200
Ah-Qing

364
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,200
I didn't expect you to live here

365
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
I was going to live with my daughter

366
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,200
And help her take care of the kids

367
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,200
Who knew she kept blaming me

368
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,200
I moved back

369
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,200
To be Fang's sister's partner

370
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,200
That's good

371
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,200
The landlord told me

372
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,200
The furniture was here

373
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,200
You can clean up the rest

374
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,200
Okay

375
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
I can't bear to leave you

376
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,200
When is the farewell?

377
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,200
There's no farewell

378
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
Le Le

379
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
What? What did you ask?

380
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,200
What's wrong?

381
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,200
Let's talk again

382
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,200
Fine, fine

383
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,200
Actually, Fang doesn't like those

384
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,200
She doesn't believe in religion

385
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,200
She only likes singing

386
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,200
When she hears people's prayers, her head will hurt

387
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
I...

388
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
Thank you

389
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,200
I can actually...

390
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,200
We can clean up

391
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,200

487
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200

488
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200

490
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,200
I'm sorry

491
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,200
I'm sorry

492
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,200
I'm sorry

493
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,200
I'm sorry

494
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,200
I'm sorry

495
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,200
I'm sorry

496
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,200
I'm sorry

497
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,200
I'm sorry

498
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,200
Go

499
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,160
Nobody runs out of eyes

500
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,200
Don't

501
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,200
What's wrong?

502
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,200
There are not enough things from this put

503
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,200
It's unfair

504
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,200
Isn't it too ruthless

505
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
You're so heartless.

506
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,200
Heartless?

507
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,200
I'm not heartless anymore.

508
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,200
Right, you're the most heartless.

509
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,200
What is this? You've been paying for her medical bills?

510
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,200
Where did you get the money? Didn't you take the house to the loan?

511
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,200
So you're borrowing money for Wang Xiao Fang?

512
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,200
This is my money.

513
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,200
I thought she was in San Francisco or the US.

514
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,200
You contacted her and you still didn't let me know?

515
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,200
Don't you think this is too much?

516
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,200
She left me and us behind.

517
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,200
You forgot?

518
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,200
Do you know why I want to learn English?

519
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,200
Because I want to find her.

520
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,200
Because I think I have the ability to find her. Do you know why I want to be a tour guide?

521
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,200
I want to find her. I want to leave you.

522
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,200
Do you understand?

523
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,200
I don't understand.

524
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,200
I really don't understand.

525
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,200
She lives here and you tell me what will happen.

526
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,200
I'm now...

527
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,200
Even the neighbor next door, Li Jun, A Qing...

528
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,200
A Qing?

529
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,200
A Qing, whatever!

530
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,200
She knows more than my mom and I do.

531
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,200
I don't want to live.

532
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,200
I don't want to live.

533
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,200
She will tell you why she's leaving.

534
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,200
She knows I have a lot of questions for her.

535
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,280
I think after moetang...

536
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,300
I would thann find a car with no brakes.

537
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,260
Then stop determine if you want to hire something.

538
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,820
Don't glue your fur on my back like that.

539
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,660
That's because I wanted to be in my job.

540
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,440
I want money and to live.

541
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,760
I want to be a star magician.

542
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,480
Send a note to the police.

543
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,300
Can you translate for me?

544
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,300
I'm sorry!

545
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,800
Let me tell you.

546
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,800
My mom took me to the photo studio.

547
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,300
You don't know, right?

548
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,800
She wanted to leave you, not me!

549
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,800
Your mom's been having a hard time these past few years.

550
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,800
I'm sorry.

551
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,300
Look at this. How could I possibly scold her?

552
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,800
Shao Shao went to lose that girl because of me.

553
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,300
Lin Jiayuan, can't you be so ungrateful because of your son's moral judgment?

554
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,300
No.

555
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,300
The girl sitting next to Shao Shao was the one who made a scene.

556
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,800
She yelled at Shao Shao and said,

557
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,300
What's so great about a housewife? How could she possibly be a superhero?

558
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,300
You're so annoying.

559
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,300
So this is a housewife?

560
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,800
Look at her drawing me. Pretty, right?

561
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,300
So many hands. What's this?

562
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,800
This is a broom.

563
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,300
What about this?

564
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,300
This is...

565
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,300
a shit?

566
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,300
Someone's been using it to get shit.

567
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,800
It's garbage!

568
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,300
So in your mind, you're a...

569
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,800
octopus?

570
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,800
This is a son's love for his mother. You don't understand.

571
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,300
Other people have love too.

572
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,300
Your son is throwing away other people's pencils. They have love too, okay?

573
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,800
Here it is.

574
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,300
What are you looking at?

575
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,800
My son drew this.

576
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,800
Let me see.

577
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,800
It's really good.

578
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,800
I'm sorry.

579
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,300
It's okay.

580
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,800
Are you okay?

581
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,300
I'm okay.

582
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,800
You...

583
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,300
Just take it as if he's traveling again.

584
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,300
It's the same as before.

585
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,300
Yeah.

586
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,300
Look at...

587
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,300
Look at how much of a father and mother Huang Shu Fei has been.

588
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,300
It's the same as when he was away.

589
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,300
I'm okay. Let's talk.

590
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,800
Let's talk.

591
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,800
How did you do today?

592
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,300
Yeah.

593
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,800
I think he didn't leave anything behind.

594
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,300
It seems like he...

595
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,800
is always ready to leave.

596
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,800
He's always ready to leave.

597
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,300
You're thinking,

598
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,800
if your mom left back then,

599
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,800
would it be postpartum depression?

600
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,800
Was this a thing in those days?

601
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,800
I have to say that that sentence on my knees

602
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,800
really reminded me of that.

603
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,800
So maybe my mom really had postpartum depression.

604
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:52,200
these

605
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,280
ideas

606
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,620
Where did I

607
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,920
I've found

608
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,920
First to see

609
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,280
what

610
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,280
I found a very empty room

611
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,280
Wow, there was only one sofa

612
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:21,280
And a bed, a toothbrush, and a pair of pills

613
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,280
And a pair of black rubber long sleeves

614
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,280
Can you just be like a normal mom?

615
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,280
Leave me a gold bar

616
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,280
Or a gold ring, a gold bracelet

617
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,280
A name tag, anything

618
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,280
I need all of these

619
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,280
I don't understand why you abandoned us

620
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,280
You abandoned everything, you abandoned me

621
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,280
And you lived such a hard life

622
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:03,280
I lived my life just to pursue the dreams that people outside told me

623
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,280
This kind of behavior, this kind of stupid behavior

624
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:13,280
I can only say that you are very similar to me

625
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:22,280
As a woman, I didn't forgive you

626
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:29,280
But as a woman, I can understand you

627
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,280
Are you just tired?

628
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,280
Are you overwhelmed by fear?

629
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:43,280
Are you overwhelmed by fear?

630
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,280
You want to be yourself

631
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,280
You are very tired, you are under a lot of pressure

632
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,280
But you know what?

633
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,280
I actually envy you

634
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,280
Because I think you are braver than me

635
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,280
I only consider you as a friend

636
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:13,280
A friend

637
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,280
Meiya

638
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,280
Sameer

639
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,280
Meiya

640
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,280
See you

641
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,280
See you

642
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,200
If you don't want any mistakes,

643
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,380
don't fight for anything else,

644
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,280
but focus on showing your strength.

645
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,000
To this point,

646
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,000
given the fact

647
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,180
the crowd has grown so much.

648
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,480
I know knotthose blowing up

649
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,800
so that everyone knows

650
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,120
that 곧罗!,

651
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,920
so I don't have to feel so worried

652
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,840
now it's gonna pass.

653
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,580
Do whatever you want.

654
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,340
Or at least

655
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,340
But no matter what, I...

656
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,340
I've grown up now.

657
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,340
Without you,

658
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,340
I still grew up.

659
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,340
And I'm doing very well.

660
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,340
I'll be doing very well,

661
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,340
right?

662
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,340
I'm sorry.

663
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,340
Actually, I don't know.

664
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,340
In my life, I really...

665
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,340
You're treating my words as air?

666
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,340
Are you sure you want to say that?

667
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,340
I'm sorry.

668
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,340
This is a stage for talking.

669
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,340
Not your mother's house.

670
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,340
I'm sorry.

671
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,340
You can't say sorry as food.

672
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,340
The audience won't listen to your sorry.

673
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,340
They don't need to know

674
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,340
what happened before you came on stage.

675
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,340
They came here

676
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,340
just to relax.

677
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,340
I know.

678
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,340
Okay.

679
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,340
Bring the draft.

680
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,340
I'll change it for you.

681
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,340
You mean I can write it this way?

682
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,340
Hurry up.

683
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:53,340
The first day I met your mother,

684
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,340
we danced all night.

685
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,340
Dance?

686
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,340
I didn't even see her smile.

687
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,340
She even danced?

688
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,340
Actually, she used to like to smile.

689
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,340
I still remember

690
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:09,340
she used to be a very happy person.

691
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:14,340
Especially when she was singing on stage.

692
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:23,340
She's been alone all the time.

693
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:26,340
Her parents are long gone.

694
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,340
To some extent,

695
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:32,340
we're all suitable for one person.

696
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,340
Why do we have to have a baby?

697
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,340
It's not like we're trying to have a baby.

698
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,340
We find it unsuitable and then we throw it away.

699
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,340
How do we know if it's suitable

700
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,340
if it's not suitable?

701
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,340
When we were young,

702
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:52,340
we all loved to watch alien movies.

703
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:57,340
Nobody believed there were aliens.

704
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:00,340
Only your mother believed me.

705
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,340
She even told me

706
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:05,340
she wanted to move to outer space with me.

707
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,340
Did you hate her?

708
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,340
I...

709
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,340
I didn't understand her before.

710
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:17,340
But I never hated her.

711
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,340
When we were older,

712
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,340
nothing mattered anymore.

713
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:47,340
The best wishes

714
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:50,340
ordinary days

715
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,340
Dad, why are you washing clothes?

716
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,340
I almost forgot to give you.

717
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:08,340
I found this in the cabinet in your mother's kitchen.

718
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:11,340
I put it away.

719
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,340
I'm sorry.

720
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,340
The ground

721
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:47,360
Ne surveil

722
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:49,340
Don't worry.

723
00:43:49,340 --> 00:44:01,560
I'll get it back soon and Chuan

724
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,060
and get the fruit.

725
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,340
While everyone else is busy.

726
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,340
Every day

727
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:07,060
I start drinking it

728
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,340
It's floral.

729
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,340
Boring.

730
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,340
It's you, indeed

731
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,540
Hello, Your Highness

732
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,740
Long time no see

733
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:16,740
Yes

734
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,340
Do you remember Yang Bo-po?

735
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:23,540
He's the one who helped you get fit

736
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,340
How would he remember?

737
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:32,340
You've been in touch with him?

738
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,940
Fang has been unwell

739
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:41,540
He's not in a stable mood

740
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:42,540
Yes

741
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:43,940
Okay, I'll go

742
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,540
Okay

743
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,740
Mom

744
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:08,740
In my dreams

745
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,140
I've seen you countless times

746
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,140
In real life

747
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,740
I also feel like I've met you often

748
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,740
Outside the window

749
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,340
At the alley

750
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:25,740
I know

751
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,740
Or at the side of the road

752
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,740
But I know

753
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,340
It's not you

754
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,540
Put your hands together

755
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:36,540
One, two, three

756
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,540
Because

757
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:40,540
I miss you so much

758
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:41,540
Come on

759
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:42,540
Smile

760
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,740
You said you'd take me to Mount Jiu-jin

761
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,140
To see the bridge

762
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,140
And the aliens

763
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,340
I deliberately forgot

764
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:58,340
You would smile

765
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,540
Mom, hold me

766
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:07,940
Mom, hold me

767
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:08,940
I'm here

768
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:09,940
Come on

769
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:10,940
Get ready

770
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,940
I can forget

771
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,740
You've worked so hard

772
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,940
I deliberately forgot

773
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,940
The day you were leaving

774
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,340
I told you to leave

775
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:50,140
Mom, you can leave

776
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,140
But don't cry anymore

777
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:07,540
Mom

778
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,540
Mom

779
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,540
Mom

780
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,540
Mom

781
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:07,540
Mom

782
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:37,540
Mom

783
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,540
Mom

784
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:38,540
Mom

785
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:11,540
Ordinary day
