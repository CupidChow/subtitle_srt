00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Episode 2

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm his daughter, but I can't do anything today.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But I will ask the nurse to bring him over.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So please wait for us a little longer, okay?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yes, I know. The doctor is going to rest.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm really sorry.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Sorry, please wait a moment.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Sorry, the nurse is calling.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'll call you back in a moment. Thank you.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yanni, where are you now?

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Why are you in Zhongli?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Didn't I tell you last week...

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yanni, let me tell you.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's okay. I'll take him to the hospital now.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
When you get to Taipei, go to the hospital immediately.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Okay? Bye.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Isn't he going to the hospital by himself?

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We're going to the hospital now.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Who are you with?

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You look so tired.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm fine. Really.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Don't let anyone take care of you.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm fine.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm already grown up. I can take care of myself.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
No matter how old you are, you need someone to take care of you.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thank you.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Nanny, I'm sorry.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm sorry. It's in there.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Cheng Le Le, this is the third time in two weeks.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Do you still want this job?

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
If you're capable, you can find someone to take care of you.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
If you can't, your colleagues will cover for you.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Are you kidding me?

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm really sorry, I'm sorry to you too.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I have no excuse.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But because something happened so suddenly today...

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
No, you said the same thing last time.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I really don't know.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I don't know if I can use you again.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Please give me another chance. I'll work hard.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
My dad is going to the hospital today.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I have something to do.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
But I already have a nurse to help me.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So please give me another chance.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I really need this job.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That's weird.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Why do you want me to take care of your personal affairs?

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What are you going to do next? Do I have to teach you?

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Thank you.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm leaving.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Remember to send me a new letter.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Hello.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Hello, thank you.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Here's the letter.

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I didn't become a mother.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But I became my dad's mother.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm home.

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Here.

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Oh, you don't want to eat?

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The lightning struck.

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hello.

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Hello, I'm from the 223 family.

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yes.

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Be quiet. I can't hear you.

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I want to ask if my parents are doing well?

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I know.

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's probably because the weather is too dry.

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
They think they've already been raised.

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You're really great.

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Very careful and professional.

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Thank you.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll have to trouble you to take care of them.

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay, I'll go back to see them as soon as possible.

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It should be next month.

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Here.

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You don't drink water?

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But you've been drinking very little water lately.

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Your lips are cracked.

85
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm always talking.

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Let me help you check.

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
A few days ago, I received your insurance.

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It seems like you paid for it 40 years ago.

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You seem to have taken out all the money in it.

90
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So there's not much left.

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
They wanted me to handle it.

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But you have to sign it yourself.

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Don't blame me.

94
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'll sign it for you.

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm telling you, I'm very good at signing.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I thought I was in the contact.

97
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
But the teacher didn't notice.

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
By the way, Zhang Kai.

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Before you asked me if I wanted to go to Singapore with him.

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Do you want to go with him?

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Of course I want to.

102
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But I can't.

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I know.

104
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You'll say,

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I don't care about you.

106
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Just go.

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Right?

108
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Okay, I admit I thought about it before.

109
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'll leave you.

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Sorry.

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Sometimes I can't tell if it's because of responsibility or guilt.

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Actually, I...

113
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Actually, I'm very tired.

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But I feel sorry for you.

115
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You know what?

118
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Sometimes I feel like you're like a sand.

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
When I'm relaxed, you'll flow away from my fingers.

120
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Do you understand?

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You know I hate you calling me.

122
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But it's been a while since I heard it.

123
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Can you call me?

124
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Zhang Lele.

125
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Zhang Lele.

126
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Zhang Lele.

127
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm sorry, Dad. I'm not complaining.

128
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's just...

129
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm really a little tired.

130
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I do the same thing every day.

131
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Can you tell me if I'll get better?

132
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm afraid.

133
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm afraid you'll leave all of a sudden.

134
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But I'm even more afraid.

135
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You can't leave.

136
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm sorry. I'm not filial.

137
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Hit me. Hit me.

138
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Hit me.

139
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Hit me.

140
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Miss Huang is taking a day off today.

142
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll help you to check the files on the table.

143
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'll give them back to you later. Bye.

144
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Where's Shu Fei?

145
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
He's always taking off today.

146
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I have a proposal next week.

147
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Have you finished the work?

148
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yes.

149
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
We have a plan for a secret hospitalization.

150
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
We have several hospitals online today.

151
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
We can report to the general manager after the weekend.

152
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You're not working?

153
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You're so old-fashioned.

154
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Hello?

155
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Ms. Chen, there's a set of tickets.

156
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Okay, I'll send it to you.

157
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
No problem.

158
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I know you don't like sweets.

159
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But that's the Beihai Island steamed roll.

160
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's worth trying.

161
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The strawberry from Beihai Island?

162
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's very ritualistic.

163
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's been very popular in the past few years.

164
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Here.

165
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Mom and Dad, are you okay?

166
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm okay.

167
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm just a little tired.

168
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm going to Beihai Island for the New Year this year.

169
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Of course.

170
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm eating New Year's Eve alone.

171
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Do you know when I feel the best?

172
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's when I take them to eat New Year's Eve.

173
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I forget everything.

174
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Everything is quiet.

175
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I can hear the sound of snow falling on the ground.

176
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
They all feel I'm poor.

177
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But I feel relieved.

178
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I don't need to...

179
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I don't need to say those sweet words.

180
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Those jokes.

181
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm just a rich lady.

182
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm just a rich lady.

183
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm going to be a rich lady this year.

184
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm going to be a rich lady this year.

185
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I still haven't told Lele that you two had a car accident.

186
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I know.

187
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's not moral to keep secrets like that between people.

188
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But I don't want them to feel sorry for me.

189
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm afraid of hearing the news of Anhui.

190
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I know what they're going to say.

191
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm sorry.

192
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Lies are like wishes.

193
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I've believed in myself for a long time.

194
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I believe you're still here.

195
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You're living in a different place.

196
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Mom and Dad.

197
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I really miss you.

198
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I feel like I can't remember you.

199
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'll try to remember you.

200
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You're off work?

201
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Yes.

202
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You can stand up again.

203
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Take off your jacket. We'll have noodles later.

204
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Come on.

205
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Go wash up.

206
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
We'll have dinner later.

207
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Go wash up.

208
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Dad.

209
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Dad!

210
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Dad!

211
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,480
I can't imagine

212
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,360
my ta mple

213
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,240

214
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,200
Who is it, 我 outreach

215
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,120
I still don't know easy

216
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,960
How can I do this

217
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,480
U me

218
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,320
I am going out

219
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,160
I am going

220
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,280
I have been very busy

221
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,680
I don't have time

222
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,440
I really like you

223
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,480

не

226

I'm sorry.

227
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,480
The faster you tie it, the faster it will drop.

228
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,480
So we tie it like this.

229
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,480
It won't go in too quickly.

230
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,480
And then the whole part is empty.

231
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,480
Then her belly will be very dirty.

232
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,480
One, two, three.

233
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,480
Point your head.

234
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,480
Point your head.

235
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,480
Come on, push it hard.

236
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,480
That's great, dad.

237
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,480
Okay, hold it.

00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,560
What do you mean?

385
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,560
I'm sorry, brother.

386
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,560
My mistake.

387
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,560
Of course.

388
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,160
My mistake.

389
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,160
Cheng Le Le

390
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,560
This is you in Spain

391
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,560
You brought me a...

392
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,560
I think it's a...

393
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,560
A bear? I kept it till now

394
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,560
You guys go to America

395
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,560
I've always liked

396
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,560
This photo

397
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,560
You're so handsome when you were young

398
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,560
I remember my classmates when I was young

399
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,560
They all said to me, your dad is so handsome

400
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,560
But I think you're getting more and more handsome

401
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,560
Look at the family photo

402
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,560
Who is this kid?

403
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,560
Who is this kid?

404
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,560
Cheng Le Le

405
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,560
Who is Cheng Le Le?

406
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,560
It's me

407
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,560
Look, it's blue

408
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,560
This is my first car

409
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,560
Can you not send me away?

410
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,560
I'm not sending you away

411
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,560
I'm just worried that

412
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,560
No one will take care of you

413
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,560
It's going to rain, let's go home

414
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,560
He will tell you

415
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,560
Why he's leaving

416
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,560
Dad, don't let go

417
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,560
Dad, don't let go of the ball

418
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,560
Dad, don't let go

419
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,560

00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,560
Dad, don't let go

463
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,560
Dad, don't let go

464
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,560
Dad, don't let go

465
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,560
Dad, don't let go

466
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,560
Dad, don't let go

467
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,560
Dad, don't let go

468
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,560

469
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,560

473
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,560
Dad, don't let go

474
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,560
Phone call

475
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,560
Hello

476
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,560
I haven't been able to reach you all day

477
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,560
How are you?

478
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,560
How's Reba?

479
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,560
She's gone

480
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,560
Where?

481
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,560
Oh shit! Where?

482
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,560
I'll go find you

483
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,560
No

484
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,560
It's okay

485
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,560
I actually think that I can spend the next few days quietly with her

486
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,560
That's pretty good

487
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,560
She'll be here sooner or later, right?

488
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,560
Don't worry

489
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,560
Just like this

490
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,560
I'll be right there

491
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,560
Miss, this is the death certificate you applied for

492
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,560
Hello, I'm here to help you with your work

493
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,560
Okay

494
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,560
Hello

495
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,560
Miss, good news

496
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,560
There's already an outpatient

497
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,560
We can start to deliver next Monday

498
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,560
Thank you.

499
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,560
Hello, what's up?

500
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,560
My grandma took two kids back to the south.

501
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,560
Do you want me to go there?

502
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,560
Or should I bring you something?

503
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,560
It's okay, I don't need anything.

504
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,560
You should have a lot of things to do now.

505
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,560
I'll be there in an hour.

506
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,560
I really don't need it.

507
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,560
I'm just worried about how to deal with my dad's business.

508
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:55,560
I finally know why my dad is so reluctant to throw things away.

509
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,560
Lin Jiayu, I know.

510
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,560
I found out that the ceremony of the 7th and 49th day

511
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,560
was for the family to use as a cash register.

512
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:20,560
But my dad's farewell ceremony is over.

513
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,560
I don't know what I should do now.

514
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,560
I'm sorry.

515
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,560
I'm sorry.

516
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,560
I'm sorry.

517
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,560
I'm sorry.

518
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,560
I'm sorry.

519
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,560
I'm sorry.

520
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,560
I'm sorry.

521
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,560
I'm sorry.

522
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,560
I'm sorry.

523
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,560
I'm sorry.

524
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,560
I'm sorry.

525
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,560
I'm sorry.

526
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,560
I'm sorry.

527
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,560
I'm sorry.

528
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,560
I'm sorry.

529
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,560
I don't know if I can do it.

530
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,560
I can't handle it.

531
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,560
I don't know if I can do it.

532
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,560
I don't care. Just try.

533
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,560
Today is the day your mother died.

534
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,560
You're right.

535
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,560
Your mother didn't leave you anything.

536
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:16,560
So I plan to record a short message for you every day.

537
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,560
If I leave one day,

538
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,560
these words will accompany you.

539
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,560
You won't be so lonely, right?

540
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,560
My idea is cool, right?

541
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,560
I'm in your heart.

542
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,560
What?

543
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,560
I guess you're turning a blind eye, right?

544
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,560
It's better than crying, right?

545
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,560
What am I thinking?

546
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,560
Oh, right.

547
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,560
You went home with me from the hospital.

548
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,560
Didn't you ask me what you wanted to say?

549
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,560
I just broke up with your mother.

550
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,560
You didn't talk to me for half a year.

551
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,560
I kept talking to you.

552
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,560
I kept talking to you.

553
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,560
One day, you started talking to me.

554
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,560
What did I say?

555
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,560
You said you wanted a map of the US.

556
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,560
The one you hanged in your room.

557
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,560
I'm old.

558
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,560
I can't remember what happened yesterday.

559
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:37,560
But I remember what happened before.

560
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,560
Well...

561
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,560
I can't remember what I said.

562
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,560
That's all for today.

563
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,560
The first episode is shorter.

564
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,560
Bye.

565
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,560
I don't know if I can do it.

566
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,560
Let's see.

567
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,560
Bye.

568
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,560
I don't know most people in my phone.

569
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,560
I forgot who they are.

570
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,560
So I don't need to care about them.

571
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,560
But the people in this cloth are very important.

572
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:22,560
This is my friend who helped me when I needed it.

573
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:27,560
I'll thank them when I leave.

574
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,560
I'll thank them.

575
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,560
I'll tell them not to come to me.

576
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,560
I'll go and check the road.

577
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,560
Uncle Wu, I'm sorry.

578
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,560
I'm not a good person.

579
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,560
I can go anywhere.

580
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,560
Chen Li.

581
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,560
Come on.

582
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,560
Let's take a picture.

583
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,560
I'm sure that Zhao Yun will comfort you.

584
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,560
You must cherish them.

585
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,560
Otherwise, you'll be lonely when you get old.

586
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:08,560
Although your uncles and aunts don't know what a talk show is,

587
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,560
I told them that you were doing something great.

588
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:18,560
It's not easy to make yourself happy in this world.

589
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,560
You have to make others happy.

590
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,560
You're great, Le Le.

591
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,560
Look at your face.

592
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,560
You're 80 years old.

593
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,560
How do I look?

594
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,560
Handsome, right?

595
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,560
You're a gentleman.

596
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,560
You should be here soon.

597
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,560
You're free today.

598
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,560
By the way,

599
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,560
take this home and eat it.

600
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,560
Don't eat outside.

601
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,560
It's not good.

602
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,560
You're here.

603
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,560
You're here.

604
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,560
Hello, Le Le.

605
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,560
Okay.

606
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,560
Go ahead.

607
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,560
It's okay.

608
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,560
Bye.

609
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,560
You said I'm unreliable.

610
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,560
Some people are less reliable than me.

611
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,560
You're free today.

612
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,560
Let's find a place to eat and talk.

613
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:01,560
But the young people's life is more important than the parents' life.

614
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,560
I'm sorry.

615
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,560
We treated our parents like this when we were young.

616
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,560
I'm sorry.

617
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,560
Three, repair the bike.

618
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,560
Four, return it to the road again.

619
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,560
Five, the god's steak.

620
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,560
Six, find time to watch Le Le's show.

621
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,560
Why is my show still in sixth place?

622
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,560
I'm still behind a steak.

623
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,560
Are you serious?

624
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,560
You should review it yourself.

625
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,560
You never invited me to watch your show.

626
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,560
I'm so embarrassed to watch it.

627
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,560
Why are you embarrassed?

628
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,560
You're my real mother.

629
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,560
You don't have to worry about me.

630
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,560
Don't look at me.

631
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,560
I worked hard when I was young.

632
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,560
I ran to earn money to buy a house.

633
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,560
I hope we can have a house.

634
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,560
I can be with you for a long time.

635
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,560
I can be with you all the time.

636
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,560
I know I'm getting old.

637
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:16,560
I don't like you to keep the old man on me.

638
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,560
Who doesn't get old?

639
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,560
Who doesn't forget?

640
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,560
When I leave,

641
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,560
you'll cry for a few days.

642
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,560
I'll be with you.

643
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:37,560
You'll cry for a few days.

644
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:43,560
Then you'll go back to normal.

645
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:48,560
Live a normal life.

646
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,560
Maybe you'll forget me.

647
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,560
You don't have to lie.

648
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,560
You're amazing.

649
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:10,560
You told me that you could cry neuro-fleischer in the Usually video.

650
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,560
Killed by me.

651
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,560
I still don't think about it

652
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,560
You tell me about the other day

653
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,560
We should stop talking about it for a moment.

654
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,560
Are you sure?

655
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,560
Sure?

656
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,600
If someone approaches you,

657
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,440
you'll be jailed for more than ten years.

658
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,680
Left tears are the best way

659
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,160
for someone who has spread joy abroad to come to our country.

660
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,780
We love you,

661
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,300
and we cherish you.

662
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,700
So,

663
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,780
if you have no other choice,

664
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,700
go goad yourself.

665
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,560
I know.

666
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,960
If you have no other choices,

667
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,160
then I'll have to suffer.

668
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,960
If you throw the model of love

669
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,960
...can keep some distance.

670
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,700
I'm afraid...

671
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,840
...he'll leave home again.

672
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,960
I'm sorry.

673
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,960
Okay, I'll send you the wallet.

674
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,960
Okay, thank you. Good night. Bye.

675
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,960
Sis, I'm going to a beauty clinic today.

676
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,960
I've found a great price.

677
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,960
Ken.

678
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,960
Oh no.

679
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,960
What if I give up this beauty project?

680
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,960
What if we join a LeLin group?

681
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,960
Don't you think we're too unkind to the elderly?

682
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,960
We let them live their lives.

683
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,960
But they also want to go out and play.

684
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,960
Someone must have planned it.

685
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,960
If I had money, I'd rather spend it on LeLin.

686
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,960
I'd be 28 years old.

687
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,960
You're not listening to me.

688
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,960
No.

689
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,960
Sis, you're not listening to me.

690
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,960
Even though you're my boss, I have to tell you...

691
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,960
...we've been busy for so long.

692
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,960
What's the purpose?

693
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,960
Tomorrow we can leave the case with him.

694
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,960
I'm so happy.

695
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,960
Don't you want to give me a lucky star?

696
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,960
What a beautiful voice.

697
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,960
Tonight, an old friend of ours...

698
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,960
...has come back.

699
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,960
How much money does he have?

700
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,960
I want to share with you.

701
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,960
Ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome...

702
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,960
...Chen Lang Lang!

703
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,960
Hello, everyone.

704
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,960
I'm Chen Le Le.

705
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,960
How are you today?

706
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,960
I have a friend who's kind-hearted...

707
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,960
...and let the elderly sit in his seat.

708
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,960
He was fired from his company.

709
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,960
Do you know why?

710
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,960
Why?

711
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,960
Because he's a driver.

712
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,960
This cold joke is my dad's joke.

713
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,960
I only have one thought.

714
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,960
I can't be an actor anymore.

715
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,960
I can't be an actor anymore.

716
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,960
It's because of my genes.

717
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,960
Do you know that?

718
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,960
Speaking of my dad, he passed away a while ago.

719
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,960
I saw some of the audience's faces.

720
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,960
They were frozen.

721
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,960
I'll change to a more gentle voice.

722
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,960
I'll be a little more gentle.

723
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,960
I'll be a little more gentle.

724
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,960
I'll be a little more gentle.

725
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,960
I'll change to a more gentle voice.

726
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,960
My dad went home.

727
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,960
I'm sure you know that he went home...

728
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,960
...to that house, not this house.

729
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,960
If he went back to this house, it would be seven days later.

730
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,960
When my grandma passed away when I was little,

731
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,960
my dad told me,

732
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,960
Le Le, grandma's asleep.

733
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,960
I said,

734
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,960
Grandma's asleep for a long time.

735
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,960
I'll wake her up.

736
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,960
My dad changed his words.

737
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,960
Le Le, wait.

738
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,960
Grandma went to heaven.

739
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,960
I heard it and I said,

740
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,960
Why?

741
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,960
Why are you so nice?

742
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,960
Why don't you take me there?

743
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,960
For a kid who just joined the funeral,

744
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,960
you can't find a perfect explanation...

745
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,960
...for what death is.

746
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,960
Before my dad died,

747
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,960
he became a child.

748
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,960
Taking care of an old child...

749
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,960
...is a very tiring task.

750
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,960
I always thought he needed me, he relied on me.

751
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,960
After he died, I realized...

752
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,960
...that I needed him.

753
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,960
I thought I didn't need to come back here.

754
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,960
Because the world of the mouth-to-mouth show doesn't need Le Le.

755
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,960
But after my dad died,

756
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,960
the only place I wanted to come was here.

757
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,960
Because I'm Le Le.

758
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,960
I can't live without the mouth-to-mouth show.

759
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,960
I need you.

760
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,960
Don't be so mean.

761
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,960
I'm a very happy person.

762
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,960
I have...

763
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,960
...people who love me...

764
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,960
...and people I love.

765
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,960
And those who have heard me say my dad's lines.

766
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,960
You know, my dad is always so annoying.

767
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,960
He doesn't only say silly jokes.

768
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,960
Have you ever asked your dad...

769
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,960
...if he only cooked instant noodles for his daughter?

770
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,960
Le Le, have some noodles.

771
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,960
No, I have to go.

772
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,960
Hello?

773
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,960
Le Le.

774
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,960
You have something to do?

775
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,960
Then you can go ahead.

776
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,960
It's okay.

777
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,960
Bye.

778
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,960
He was driving around...

779
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,960
...and running around outside.

780
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,960
He was running around outside.

781
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,960
He was running around outside.

782
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,960
He believed that there were aliens.

783
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,960
My dad always said that...

784
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,960
...there were people higher than you...

785
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,960
...in the sky.

786
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:38,960
There were people higher than you...

787
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,960
...in the sky.

788
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,960
And a month ago...

789
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,960
...the person who was taller than me...

790
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,960
...was lying down.

791
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,960
And I realized that...

792
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,960
...I didn't have the ability to hold on to that sky.

793
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,960
I admit that I was a little angry.

794
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,960
He lied to me.

795
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,960
I was seriously angry.

796
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,960
I realized that I was actually angry at myself.

797
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,960
I realized that I was actually angry at myself.

798
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,960
How could I really believe that...

799
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,960
...he would always be there to accompany me?

800
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,960
How could I have thought that...

801
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,960
...I could be a woman...

802
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,960
...who would never grow up?

803
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,960
There are things...

804
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,960
...that no matter how long you prepare...

805
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,960
...when they happen...

806
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,960
...your sadness will not be less.

807
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,960
Hello?

808
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:30,960
I'm asking you.

809
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,960
Someone said that...

810
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:32,960
...after a person dies...

811
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,960
...the mountain will still have a temperature.

812
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,960
I'm a little afraid that he will get cold.

813
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,960
Do you think he will get cold?

814
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,960
I should have found a place to stay...

815
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,960
...to stay with him.

816
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,960
But this month...

817
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,960
...I finally figured it out.

818
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,960
Even if I can't hold on to that sky...

819
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,960
...it's okay.

820
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,960
It's okay.

821
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,960
There are really aliens.

822
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,960
What's that?

823
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,960
So ridiculous.

824
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,960
This radio...

825
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,960
...is the tool that my dad used to contact...

826
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,960
...the aliens.

827
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,960
My dad always said that in this generation...

828
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,960
...things that weren't being repaired were just thrown away.

829
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,960
But in their generation...

830
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,960
...things that were broken were to be repaired.

831
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:27,960
So I fixed the radio, dad

832
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,960
I will continue to find the alien with you

833
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,960
Sometimes people will be forgotten

834
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,960
But I think

835
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,960
With his personality of love to play cool

836
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,960
If he still remembers him after he died

837
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,960
He should be very happy

838
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:06,960
Maybe it's because of this

839
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,960
So he can be remembered forever

840
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:15,960
Right?

841
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,960
So what I want to say is

842
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,960
Dad, as long as I stand here

843
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,960
I will always consume you

844
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,960
You can't take me either, right?

845
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,960
What did you say?

846
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:43,960
Can't hear

847
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,960
I will always be with you

848
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,960
It's okay if you forget

849
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:20,960
I will help you remember

850
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:22,960
As long as I keep talking

851
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,960
I will never forget

852
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:28,960
Until

853
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,960
I also started to forget that day

854
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,960
I will always be with you

855
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,960
It's okay if you forget

856
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,960
It's okay to give up

857
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:33,960
I finally learned to fly with you

858
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,960
I forgot to ask why you fell

859
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,960
I only have a pair of shoes

860
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,960
I know I'm not ready

861
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,960
I only have a pair of shoes

862
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,960
I only have a pair of shoes

863
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,960
I only have a pair of shoes

864
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,960
I only have a pair of shoes

865
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,960
I only have a pair of shoes

866
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,960
I only have a pair of shoes

867
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,960
I only have a pair of shoes

868
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,960
I only have a pair of shoes

869
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,960
I only have a pair of shoes

870
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,960
I only have a pair of shoes

871
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,960
I only have a pair of shoes

872
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,960
I need time to remember

873
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,960
As long as I remember

874
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,960
In stalking you

875
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,960
I believe you'd think to forget

876
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,960
I'm willing to give up

877
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,960
Wandering in one direction

878
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,960
Leaving no aim

879
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,960
While discussions completed

880
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,960
Like fog stretched out

881
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:46,500
My differenceanging

882
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,960
Oh, it's like علىo

883
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,960
Air dismisss

884
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:21,960
I'm sorry.

885
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,960
I'm sorry.

886
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:23,960
I'm sorry.

887
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,960
I'm sorry.

888
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:25,960
I'm sorry.

889
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:26,960
I'm sorry.

890
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:27,960
I'm sorry.

891
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:28,960
I'm sorry.

892
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,960
I'm sorry.

893
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:30,960
I'm sorry.

894
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:31,960
I'm sorry.

895
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:32,960
I'm sorry.

896
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:33,960
I'm sorry.

897
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:34,960
I'm sorry.

898
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:35,960
I'm sorry.

899
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:36,960
I'm sorry.

900
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,960
I'm sorry.

901
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:38,960
I'm sorry.

902
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:39,960
I'm sorry.

903
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:40,960
I'm sorry.

904
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:41,960
I'm sorry.

905
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:42,960
I'm sorry.

906
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,960
I'm sorry.

907
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:44,960
I'm sorry.

908
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,960
I'm sorry.

909
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:46,960
I'm sorry.

910
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:47,960
I'm sorry.

911
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:48,960
I'm sorry.

912
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:49,960
I'm sorry.

913
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:50,960
I'm sorry.

914
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,960
I'm sorry.

915
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:52,960
I'm sorry.

916
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,960
I'm sorry.

917
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:54,960
I'm sorry.

918
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,960
I'm sorry.

919
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:56,960
I'm sorry.

920
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:57,960
I'm sorry.

921
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:58,960
I'm sorry.

922
00:51:58,960 --> 00:51:59,960
I'm sorry.

923
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:00,960
I'm sorry.

924
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:01,960
I'm sorry.

925
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,960
I'm sorry.

926
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:03,960
I'm sorry.

927
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,960
I'm sorry.

928
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:05,960
I'm sorry.

929
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:06,960
I'm sorry.

930
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:07,960
I'm sorry.

931
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:08,960
I'm sorry.

932
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,960
I'm sorry.

933
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:10,960
I'm sorry.

934
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:11,960
I'm sorry.

935
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:12,960
I'm sorry.

936
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:13,960
I'm sorry.

937
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:14,960
I'm sorry.

938
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:15,960
I'm sorry.

939
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:16,960
I'm sorry.

940
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:17,960
I'm sorry.

941
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:18,960
