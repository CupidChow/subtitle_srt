00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Episode 2

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,800
He seems to be very careless.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,000
But he actually sees everything.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Don't look at Old Qi.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,600
He doesn't seem to be afraid of anything.

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,400
But I know that his biggest fear is his daughter being unhappy.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,400
You don't know,

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,400
he asked me to teach him how to make tomato and egg rice for several times.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,800
It's not that I don't teach him.

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,600
It's that he is the only one who has the talent to make instant noodles.

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,600
Old Qi is the best friend I've ever met in my life.

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,200
The most loyal person.

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,400
Last time, in Old Tang's farewell ceremony,

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,800
I seemed to have told Old Tang the same thing.

15
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,400
Last time, I said that people of our age

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,400
attending the funeral is more likely than the number of people at the birthday party.

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,800
But Old Qi said that

18
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:20,200
now, the number of people who can sit at the bottom is also getting smaller.

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,000
Other than this,

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
how about you, Qiu Mingzhe?

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Because there's one person named Qu built this house.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,400
I just told Everyone.

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,800
He said ever since I began dating with Qiu Mingzhe,

24
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,400
the type, he has completed several relationships and then

25
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,600
met this girl, Qiu Mingzhe.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,600
But I don't know how things went from then.

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,360
She was the person,

28
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,360
I'm not a good cook.

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,360
I don't know how to dress like this.

30
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,360
But this suit is my favorite

31
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,360
from my childhood.

32
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,360
Every time I wear it,

33
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,360
he praises me.

34
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,360
So I want to wear it again

35
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,360
for my farewell today.

36
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,360
I want to make him wear it again

37
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,360
and praise me again.

38
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,360
Many of my friends

39
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,360
probably don't know

40
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,360
that I almost married Qi.

41
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,360
When we were dating,

42
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,360
Qi said very politely

43
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,360
that I married

44
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,360
because I was old and someone took care of me.

45
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,360
Nothing else.

46
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,360
He also said

47
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,360
that it was to not let my daughter worry.

48
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,360
But I thought

49
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
that for the sake of getting old,

50
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,360
I would still say no

51
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,360
if I married you.

52
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,360
But if you walk out of the coffin

53
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,360
and ask me if I want to marry you,

54
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,360
I would still say no.

55
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,360
Thank you for your kind words.

56
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,360
Now, let's invite another

57
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,360
close friend of ours,

58
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,360
Ms. Wang Mei Hui,

59
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,360
to come up and chat with us.

60
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,360
Are you sure you don't want to come up and chat?

61
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
Okay.

62
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,360
Next, we will invite Mr. Zhang Kai.

63
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
Hello, everyone. I'm Zhang Kai.

64
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,360
I'm Mr. Chen Guang Qi's

65
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,360
close friend.

66
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,360
I'm just kidding.

67
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,360
Actually, I'm also very sorry

68
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,360
that I didn't expect

69
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,360
to see a bad thing

70
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,360
in this occasion.

71
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,360
Le Ba is not only my elder,

72
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,360
but also my old friend.

73
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,360
He's very optimistic,

74
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,360
he's very energetic,

75
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,360
and he has this kind of experience

76
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,360
that I think is far better than many young people.

77
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,360
Today, I want to share

78
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,360
a little story with you.

79
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,360
Le Ba often told me in private

80
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,360
that he was grateful

81
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,360
that I took Le Le away.

82
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,360
But today, I want to take this opportunity

83
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,360
to tell him

84
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,360
that I should be grateful to him.

85
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,360
Thank you for giving Le Le to me.

86
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,360
But I don't know how to

87
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,360
return Le Le to him.

88
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,360
But no matter what,

89
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,360
the fate of Le Ba and I

90
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,360
will never disappear.

91
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,360
We are all people

92
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,360
who love Le Le the most.

93
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,360
Thank you.

94
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,360
Thank you, Mr. Chen's family and friends,

95
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,360
for bringing us together

96
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,360
to look back on the different aspects of life in the old days.

97
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,360
At the end of today's ceremony,

98
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,360
we want to invite Mr. Chen's

99
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,360
most beloved daughter, Chen Le Le,

100
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,360
to share with you

101
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,360
her family.

102
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,360
Thank you.

103
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,360
Let me protect you.

104
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,360
I will protect you.

105
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,360
Jesus, what are you doing?

106
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,360
Protect her.

107
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,360
Dad,

108
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,360
if you are really uncomfortable

109
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,360
and want to leave,

110
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,360
don't worry.

111
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,360
Don't worry about me.

112
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,360
I will protect you.

113
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,360
I will protect you.

114
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,360
I will protect you.

115
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,360
I will protect you.

116
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,360
Mr. Chen, you are awake.

117
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,360
Dad.

118
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,080
It's you.

119
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,080
I...

120
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,660
I...

121
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,860
I just...

122
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,260
got to the end of the roads.

123
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,460
I saw you up there.

124
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:48,760
***...

125
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,780
I'm scared.

126
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,940
I'm back.

127
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:20,440
Your

128
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,520
Yes.

129
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,580
You did know?

130
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,420
Then stoop to the Jam!

131
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,320
Enamble Bird

132
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,040
Stup so hard to pull

133
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,520
you're still not stora

134
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,520
Thank you for coming today.

135
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,520
I miss you all so much.

136
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,520
I heard so much from you.

137
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,520
I really feel...

138
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,520
very...

139
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,520
I really feel very...

140
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
I've never died.

141
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:25,520
I don't know how it feels to be in that wooden box.

142
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,520
I don't know if I can hear people talking.

143
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,520
So I made such a little conspiracy with my daughter.

144
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,520
I'm sorry.

145
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,520
I'm quite willful in my life.

146
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,520
I'm not a good father.

147
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,520
I'm not a good husband.

148
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,520
As a friend, I'm not very reliable.

149
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,520
I'm too interested in work.

150
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,520
I can't do anything well.

151
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,520
I really want to do...

152
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,520
I won't say it.

153
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,520
I don't have a chance to be a good son.

154
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,520
Of course I'm not a good lover.

155
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,520
But I think...

156
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,520
I'm a good person.

157
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,520
I'm afraid of regret in my life.

158
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,520
But I'm afraid of regret...

159
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,520
and I'm sorry for many people.

160
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,520
I heard so much from everyone.

161
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,520
I just found out...

162
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,520
that it's a big deal to have two feet.

163
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,520
Everyone says good things...

164
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,520
and it becomes a good memory.

165
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,520
Lele.

166
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,520
I'm sorry.

167
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,520
Lele.

168
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,520
I always say that...

169
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,520
there are high people in the sky.

170
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,520
You always tell me...

171
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,520
what if the high people squat down?

172
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,520
What should I do?

173
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,520
I'll tell you.

174
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,520
I'll be watching you in the sky.

175
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,520
Don't be afraid.

176
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,520
I'll be watching you.

177
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,520
I wanted to tell you...

178
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,520
I'll be back no matter what.

179
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,520
Do you think we should...

180
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,520
get married as soon as possible?

181
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,520
Do you think we should...

182
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,520
get married as soon as possible?

183
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,520
I can apply for a leave.

184
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,520
Why?

185
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,520
Run!

186
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,520
I can't even handle my dad.

187
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,520
I'm glad that we didn't have a baby.

188
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,520
Otherwise, things would be...

189
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,520
really hard to handle.

190
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,520
If something happens to my dad today...

191
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,520
those bad things...

192
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,520
and the good things...

193
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,520
I'll listen to you.

194
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,520
If there's a problem with the financial situation...

195
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,520
No problem.

196
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,520
Thank you.

197
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,520
Le Le.

198
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,520
Can you not be so aggressive?

199
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,520
Chen Guang Qi is really...

200
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,520
crazy.

201
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,520
You have a wife and a daughter.

202
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,520
What do you mean?

203
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,520
Don't you think it's ridiculous...

204
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,520
for you to help him with the farewell?

205
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,520
Do you think I can stop him...

206
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,520
from doing what he wants?

207
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,520
That's enough.

208
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,520
You can't even walk five steps.

209
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,520
I'm tired. I want to sit down.

210
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,520
Ten more steps.

211
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,520
Mr. Chen, have some medicine.

212
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,520
Here.

213
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,520
No.

214
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,520
You're asking me for a leave? Seven steps.

215
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,520
I'll give you ice cream later.

216
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,520
Okay?

217
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,520
Okay. I'll eat it.

218
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,520
You can do it. You look great today.

219
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,520
Yes, you're great.

220
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,520
One more step. Yes, you're great.

221
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,520
You're great, Chen Guang Qi.

222
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,520
Why are you talking like a dog?

223
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,520
Please. Even dogs can walk faster than you.

224
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,520
I just talked like a dog.

225
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,520
Come on. Hurry.

226
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,520
Don't pick the big one.

227
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,520
You picked the big one.

228
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,640
This one?

229
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,640
Big one?

230
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,520
Try.

231
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,520
Mavarice, you must...

232
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,520
Wait a minute.

233
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,520
I'm tired.

234
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,520
Don't pass me.

235
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,020
I'm so happy.

236
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,440
Ice cream, ice cream.

237
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,440
This is the best.

238
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,020
Really?

239
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,480
And then in this place,

240
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,480
when you go to the supermarket,

241
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,740
you don't actually have to pay.

242
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,940
Because all the caretakers

243
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,440
are the cashiers.

244
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,200
They will tell you,

245
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,480
you don't have to pay.

246
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,360
Because someone paid for you.

247
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,700
And those old people will say,

248
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,280
not bad.

249
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,700
Is dad funny?

250
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,820
I have to be very focused to be able to walk straight.

251
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,520
It's delicious.

252
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,520
After every practice,

253
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,520
I'll treat you to ice cream.

254
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,520
Okay?

255
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,520
You're so good at it.

256
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
Let me take a picture for you.

257
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,520
Come on.

258
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,520
Good.

259
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,520
Let's take a picture.

260
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,520
It's hot again.

261
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
Come on.

262
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,520
Good.

263
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,520
Are you all right?

264
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,520
You're still taking medicine.

265
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,520
Dad.

266
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,520
I'm coming.

267
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,520
Dad, wait.

268
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,520
Dad.

269
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,520
Why are you here?

270
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,520
Dad.

271
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,520
Why are you not going in?

272
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,520
Do you need help?

273
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,520
Tell me.

274
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,520
Dad.

275
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
Dad.

276
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,520
I told you I was going out.

277
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,520
And I only came back for three hours.

278
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,520
I really need to go out to work.

279
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,520
I'm going to watch TV.

280
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,520
I'll be back in three hours.

281
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,520
I'll be back soon.

282
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,520
Thank you for giving me another chance.

283
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,520
No problem.

284
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,520
Someone has a second chance.

285
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,520
Did you bring a clip?

286
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,520
I forgot to print it.

287
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,520
But I have my script on my phone.

288
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,520
You can take a look.

289
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,520
No need.

290
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,520
Just come.

291
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,520
What are you talking about?

292
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,520
The nursing home.

293
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,520
Boring.

294
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,520
No, no, no.

295
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,520
This is really interesting.

296
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,520
It's in He Lan.

297
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,520
It's true.

298
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,520
They built a nursing village for the elderly.

299
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,520
And the elderly

300
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,520
don't know how to take care of themselves.

301
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
And they have 24-hour surveillance.

302
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,520
It's really interesting.

303
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,520
It's in He Lan.

304
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,520
It's true.

305
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,520
And they have 24-hour surveillance.

306
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,520
It's really interesting.

307
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,520
Go on.

308
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,520
I'll start with my dad's situation.

309
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,520
And then I'll start to speak in reverse.

310
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,520
Like, I'm so happy.

311
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,520
And then I'll be more serious.

312
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,520
I'm more sensitive.

313
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,520
If you're okay with it.

314
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,520
Sorry, I'll take a call.

315
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,520
Hello?

316
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,520
Is this Miss Chen?

317
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,520
This is the stock market analysis and investigation company.

318
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,520
No, thank you.

319
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,520
Do you have any additional funding?

320
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,520
Sorry.

321
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,520
You have to perform well on stage.

322
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,520
Okay.

323
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,520
You're dressed like this today.

324
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,520
I look more like a girl.

325
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,520
Yes.

326
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,520
Okay.

327
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,520
Okay.

328
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,520
I'll go first.

329
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,520
Thank you.

330
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,520
I'll go prepare.

331
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,520
It's not necessary.

332
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,520
I'm still thinking about you.

333
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,520
Next is a very good actress

334
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,520
in our club.

335
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,520
As long as she's here.

336
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,520
There's no place that can't be fixed.

337
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,520
Let's welcome Chen Le Le.

338
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,520
Hi, everyone.

339
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,520
I'm Le Le.

340
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,520
How are you all doing today?

341
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,520
We're fine.

342
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,520
I'm fine.

343
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,520
I'm like you.

344
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,520
Recently, I've been...

345
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,520
I'm fine.

346
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,520
Sorry.

347
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,520
Recently, I've been living alone for a long time.

348
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,520
So I forgot to turn off some of the vibration.

349
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,520
Come on.

350
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,520
I'm not very professional.

351
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,520
I put my phone on stage.

352
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,520
Should I be very unprofessional now?

353
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,520
Where are you?

354
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,520
It's noisy over there.

355
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,520
I'm working.

356
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,520
What's wrong?

357
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,520
Your dad has been waiting for you downstairs.

358
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,520
He said you wanted to pick him up.

359
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,520
Why wait for me?

360
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,520
We didn't make an appointment.

361
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,520
Where are we going?

362
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
We're adults.

363
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,520
We'll go home by ourselves.

364
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,520
Go home by ourselves?

365
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,520
I'll give him the phone.

366
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,520
You can talk to him.

367
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,520
Le Le.

368
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
Where are you?

369
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,520
Le Le, your dad is gone.

370
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,520
Le Le.

371
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,520
I think I'm very unprofessional now.

372
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,520
Our host is here.

373
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,520
Applause.

374
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,520
Why is he gone?

375
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,520
Can you go find him for me?

376
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,520
I'll handle things here.

377
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
I'll be right back.

378
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,520
Please.

379
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,520
Jia Yu, where are you?

380
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,520
It's okay. Don't be nervous.

381
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,520
Take Le Le to the doctor.

382
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,520
It'll be fine.

383
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,520
Don't be nervous.

384
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,520
I'll go upstairs and finish my speech.

385
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,520
A single woman would say to me

386
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,520
that I can imagine

387
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,520
that you're a good father.

388
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,520
As long as you have a child,

389
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,520
your life will change completely.

390
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,520
Because in that kind of life,

391
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
it's easy to get a little bit of trouble.

392
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,520
Simple things can be very difficult.

393
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
I'm sorry.

394
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,520
I'm sorry.

395
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,520
I'm sorry.

396
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,520
I'm sorry.

397
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,520
I'm sorry.

398
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,520
I'm sorry.

399
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,520
I'm sorry.

400
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,520
I'm sorry.

401
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,520
I'm sorry.

402
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,520
I'm sorry.

403
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,520
I'm sorry.

404
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,520
I'm sorry.

405
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,520
I'm sorry.

406
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,520
I'm sorry.

407
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
I'm sorry.

408
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,520
I'm sorry.

409
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,520
I'm sorry.

410
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,520
I'm sorry.

411
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,520
I'm sorry.

412
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,520
I'm sorry.

413
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,520
I'm sorry.

414
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,520
I'm sorry.

415
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,520
I'm sorry.

416
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,520
I'm sorry.

417
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,520
I'm sorry.

418
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,520
I'm sorry.

419
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,520
I'm sorry.

420
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,520
I'm sorry.

421
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,520
I'm sorry.

422
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,520
I'm sorry.

423
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,520
I'm sorry.

424
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,520
I'm sorry.

425
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,520
I'm sorry.

426
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,520
I'm sorry.

427
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,520
I'm sorry.

428
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,520
I'm sorry.

429
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,520
Sorry, I'm sorry.

430
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,520
Let's go.

431
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,120
Dad,л

432
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,600
Gentlemen,

433
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,160
it's hard to find a choice.

434
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,520
I'm good,

435
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,760
but please go,

436
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,320
everyone.

437
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,520
I'm soon to die.

438
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,720
My life and social life

439
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,720
will require me!

440
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,320
In the end,

441
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,320
I always...

442
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,120
I wasn't going to say it!

443
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,320
No, I just..."

444
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,320
I'm short!

445
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,820
I'm sorry, you have a d*** If you call me,

446
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,880
Fat должны

447
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,400
Sing

448
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:18,820
I'm waiting for you

449
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,820
Waiting for you

450
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,820
Sir, please accompany us

451
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,820
Your daughter will be here soon

452
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,820
Wait a little longer

453
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,820
I want to go home

454
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,820
I know we will let you go

455
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,820
I have hands and feet

456
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,820
Why can't I go home

457
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,820
We will let you go

458
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,820
But you are going out alone

459
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,820
I don't need to go home

460
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,820
Be careful

461
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,820
Sir, please help me

462
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,820
No need, no need

463
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,820
Let me do it

464
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,820
I will do it myself

465
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,820
No, no, we don't need to help

466
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,820
Dad

467
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,820
Okay, okay

468
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,820
You are his daughter, right?

469
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,820
Your father may have been lost just now

470
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,820
It's dangerous to be alone on the street

471
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,820
Be careful

472
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,820
Can we go now?

473
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,820
Yes, please sign some documents

474
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,820
Come on, sit down

475
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,820
Please sign here

476
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:16,820
Do you know what kind of animal is this?

477
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,820
It's not a sense of direction

478
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,820
Lost

479
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,820
Your father is in good health

480
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,820
He is very strong

481
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,820
He was about to hit someone just now

482
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,820
By the way

483
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,820
You are his children

484
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,820
Don't let an old man

485
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,820
Stay at home and live alone

486
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,820
I didn't let him live alone

487
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,820
Okay

488
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,820
Let's go

489
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,820
Mr. Chen invited us home

490
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,820
Come on, let's go home

491
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,820
Okay, be careful

492
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,820
They think I can't find my home

493
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,820
It's really strange

494
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,820
I've never been lost

495
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,820
On the sea before

496
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,820
Be careful on the road

497
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,820
Be careful

498
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,820
Sir

499
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,820
Yes

500
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,820
Sorry, I'm tired

501
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,820
You're welcome

502
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,820
Be careful on the road

503
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,820
What's wrong?

504
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,820
Why did you go out?

505
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,820
Where did you go tonight?

506
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,820
Dad

507
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,820
Mr. Chen Guangqi

508
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,820
I'm talking to you

509
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,820
Who am I?

510
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,820
What's wrong with your hand?

511
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,820
It was fine

512
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,820
Why?

513
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,820
Mr. Chen

514
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,820
Can you listen to me?

515
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,820
Can you?

516
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,820
Give it back to me

517
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,820
Give it back to me

518
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,820
I'll give it back to you

519
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,820
But you answer all my questions first

520
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,820
Why did you go out?

521
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,820
Why did you go out?

522
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,820
What happened to you all night?

523
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,820
Can you think about it?

524
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,820
Because if it's like this

525
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,820
I don't know

526
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,820
I don't know if I can

527
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,820
Leave you alone at home

528
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,820
Do you remember?

529
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,820
We didn't meet at the door

530
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,820
Okay?

531
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,820
So don't wait for the door

532
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,820
Do you remember?

533
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,820
I've grown up

534
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,820
Don't pick me up at school

535
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,820
Do you remember?

536
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,820
I'm divorced

537
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,820
Don't mention Zhang Kai

538
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,820
Did I tell you

539
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,820
I'm going to work today

540
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,820
And I'll sit for three hours

541
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,820
Did I tell you

542
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,820
Can you listen to me?

543
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,820
Say something

544
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,820
If it's like this

545
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,820
I seriously think

546
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,820
I want to send you to the nursing home

547
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,820
Because I'm not sure

548
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,820
If I can stay in this house

549
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,820
And continue to take care of you

550
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,820
I went to the police station all these years

551
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,820
What should I do?

552
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,820
I lost my job

553
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,820
To find you

554
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,820
Do you know that?

555
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,820
I need to make money

556
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,820
I need to take care of you

557
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,820
Why?

558
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,820
Because I don't have money

559
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,820
I have no money

560
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,820
Because you took the house

561
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,820
And the loan

562
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,220
I'm so tired every night.

563
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:57,420
I'm so tired that I let you find an alien to make your home.

564
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,220
There's no alien in this world.

565
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,620
It's broken.

566
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,020
It's broken.

567
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,820
It's broken.

568
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,020
You can't find me.

569
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,020
Dad, I'm sorry.

570
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,020
I'm sorry.

571
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,020
It's broken.

572
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,220
We'll fix it.

573
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,620
I don't remember.

574
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,820
I don't remember.

575
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,020
It's okay.

576
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,620
It's okay if you don't remember.

577
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,020
I don't remember.

578
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,220
We'll fix it.

579
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,020
We'll fix it.

580
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,820
Dad, wait for me. I'll be back soon.

581
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,220
I'm sorry.

582
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:30,220
The doctor's bus ticket.

583
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,620
Don't worry about that.

584
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,420
I've already evaluated it. You can apply for an alien to take care of it.

585
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,220
Thank you.

586
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,420
But you might have to wait.

587
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,020
Because there are a lot of people queuing up now.

588
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,220
And the social aging.

589
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,020
And the children are also busy.

590
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,020
Yes, yes.

591
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,220
The population aging problem is very serious.

592
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,620
That...

593
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,020
The part you mentioned about the new medicine.

594
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,020
The new medicine part.

595
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,820
If I'm saving money now, it's...

596
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,820
The medicine now.

597
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,020
It might be for Chen Bei Bei's current situation.

598
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,020
It might not be of much help.

599
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,420
Because the main thing is that the treatment of the golden period has passed.

600
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,020
What we might be thinking now is how to make Chen Bei Bei.

601
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,420
In the whole life.

602
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,820
Get better care.

603
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:12,420
So now you're mainly taking care of Chen Bei Bei?

604
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,620
Yes, yes.

605
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,420
Because I saw some of her feet.

606
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,820
That may be because the skin is too dry.

607
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,820
She went to catch it herself.

608
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:21,220
Then we try to make the elderly stand up and walk.

609
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,820
Because if she sits for a long time,

610
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,220
It may cause an injury.

611
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,220
Even the limbs will shrink.

612
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,420
Then there may be some organs that will deteriorate.

613
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,420
By then, for them,

614
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,620
Maybe even swallowing.

615
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,020
It's even difficult to swallow saliva.

616
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,420
There are currently a lot of cases.

617
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,420
The elderly accidentally choked on the water.

618
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,220
Then I don't believe it's too late.

619
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,220
Thank you.

620
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,020
Did you have her foot knot调整?

621
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,420
Are you than scared?

622
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,420
Did the doctors still post it?

623
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,220
Of course, no.

624
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,740
You just fix the foot in that way.

625
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,340
And put it on top.

626
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,360
I think if she like this, she'll stand a little strong.

627
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,080
ек's over here, push up.

628
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,980
You're not going to have a third child, are you?

629
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,480
Okay.

630
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,680
Why are you bringing this?

631
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,880
Why are you always cursing me?

632
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,480
Le Le said she wanted to buy something for her old man.

633
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,880
It looks like what my son is using.

634
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,080
Press it on top.

635
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,380
Okay.

636
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,280
Then...right.

637
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,380
The highest part.

638
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,180
It's very high.

639
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,680
That part.

640
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,280
Here?

641
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,480
Yes.

642
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,280
Be careful.

643
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,380
Open it like this.

644
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,380
If you're going to draw it, make it bigger.

645
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,080
You can see it clearly.

646
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,280
See?

647
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,080
It's so long.

648
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,280
Where should I put it?

649
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,180
Do you have a screwdriver?

650
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,580
I'll help Le Le feel it.

651
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,680
Okay, I'll find it.

652
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,380
Okay.

653
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,080
It's so long.

654
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,580
Brother, go buy some drinks.

655
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,080
I'm so hot.

656
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,980
I'll go chat with Le Ba.

657
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,180
Le Ba!

658
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,780
He's sleeping. Don't go find him.

659
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,480
They're all bullying me.

660
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,780
He's sleeping.

661
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,780
Please.

662
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,980
He's pretending to rest.

663
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,480
He's sleeping.

664
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,980
Leave him alone.

665
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,580
I'm going with you.

666
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,780
Do you want me to open his house?

667
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,460
It's 2 a.m.

668
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,900
I'm making milk for you.

669
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:10,180
You're hungry tonight. You want milk?

670
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:28,940
Remember to go to school tomorrow.

671
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,460
I'll make you some milk.

672
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,460
Dad, let's go.

673
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,980
Come on, it's okay.

674
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,380
Let's go.

675
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,380
Be careful.

676
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,780
I want to sit.

677
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,780
Okay.

678
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,780
Can you?

679
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,780
It's hard.

680
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,780
I'll sit here.

681
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,780
You...

682
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,780
Be careful.

683
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,780
You have to take off your pants.

684
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,180
I'll wash them later.

685
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,780
Help me wipe the towel.

686
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,780
You? Okay.

687
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,780
Wait.

688
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,180
You can take it off.

689
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,780
I'll help you.

690
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,780
Be careful.

691
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,180
I'll help you.

692
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,180
Be careful.

693
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,780
Excuse me.

694
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,780
Sorry.

695
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,780
You just got off the building.

696
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,980
How did you get here without me?

697
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,980
We didn't even have the sun when you weren't around.

698
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,980
Is that so?

699
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,980
Yes.

700
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,980
I'll do it.

701
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,980
Okay.

702
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,380
Dad, are you hungry?

703
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,380
Do you want to eat something?

704
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,580
Or do you want some water?

705
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,180
You don't want it, do you?

706
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,580
I found some information about the nursing home.

707
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,580
Okay.

708
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,780
I'll leave it to you.

709
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,180
These CPs are not bad.

710
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,780
I helped you mark them.

711
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,180
I regretted it after talking to you that day.

712
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,180
You don't have to make a decision now.

713
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,980
If you can,

714
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,780
take Le Ba to see her.

715
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,580
You have to let her be in the hospital.

716
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,980
I still feel cruel no matter what.

717
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,780
Cruel?

718
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,980
How cruel?

719
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,380
At least those nursing homes

720
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,580
are for caretakers or professionals.

721
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,580
You got hurt when you took care of them.

722
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,980
You tried your best.

723
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,980
I didn't try my best.

724
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,580
I know I didn't try my best.

725
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,380
My mom ran away when I was little.

726
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,380
My dad was a big man.

727
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,180
I'm in a bit of a dilemma now.

728
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,580
I want to send him to the nursing home.

729
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,580
I shouldn't even have this idea.

730
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,580
Mom, come here.

731
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,580
Okay?

732
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,580
Mom, I'll buy you some drinks.

733
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:28,580
Why is it so easy to see?

734
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,580
Just like I said,

735
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,580
they're all for caretakers.

736
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,580
I think you should find a job

737
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,580
with a better income

738
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,580
and send Le Ba to the nursing home.

739
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:41,580
These CPs are really okay.

740
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,580
It's so hot today.

741
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,580
Dad, let's go home first.

742
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,580
Okay?

743
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:57,580
Can you not send me away?

744
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:06,580
Can you not send me away?

745
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:22,580
Can you not send me away?

746
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,580
I can take care of myself,

747
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:27,580
but don't send me to the nursing home.

748
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,580
Okay?

749
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,580
Okay.

750
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,580
Here.

751
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,580
Here.

752
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,580
This is a little better.

753
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,580
No. 55, please come to No. 16.

754
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,580
Please come to the counter. Thank you.

755
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,580
May I ask what your name is?

756
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,580
Divorce.

757
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,580
May I ask for your names

758
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,580
and your ID?

759
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,580
Please wait.

760
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,580
I'll be waiting.

761
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,580
Okay.

762
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,580

770
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,580
Bye.

771
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,580
Bye.

772
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,580
Bye.

773
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,580
Bye.

774
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,580
Bye.

775
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,580
Bye.

776
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,580
Bye.

777
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,580
Bye.

778
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,580
Bye.

779
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,580
Bye.

780
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,580
Bye.

781
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,580
Bye.

782
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,580
Bye.

783
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,580
Bye.

784
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,580
Bye.

785
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,580
Okay, then...

786
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,580
good night.

787
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,580
Take care.

788
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:48,140
This is what I wanted to make,

789
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,420
Shouze!

790
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:10,200
We now need to be in bed.

791
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,140
Hold me.

792
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,540
One two three

793
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:17,780
Six, eight, nine, ten.

794
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,620
Move out of the way

795
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:48,580
Okay

796
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,700
Be careful

797
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,620
Come

798
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:19,080
cards

799
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:24,580
Fire

800
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:47,060
When do you want to have asize?

801
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:59,660
What are you reading?

802
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:05,060
Don't require to read. You're handsome.

803
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,540
Dad, do you remember?

804
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:18,540
You used to do that

805
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,540
the watermelon game when you were little

806
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,540
Do you remember?

807
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,540
Look, it's like this

808
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,540
Let me show you

809
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,540
Look

810
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,540
Do you remember?

811
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,540
You always win

812
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,540
I won once

813
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,540
I know you lost to me on purpose

814
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,540
I'll give you one

815
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:42,540
I'll give you one

816
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,540
Come, let me show you

817
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,540
Dad

818
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,540
You always win

819
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,540
And you always dance this dance

820
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,540
Do you remember?

821
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,540
We danced it on rainy days

822
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,540
I thought you danced

823
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,540
Do you remember?

824
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,540
Come, try it

825
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,540
You'll win, I know

826
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,540
It's okay

827
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,540
It's okay if you don't remember

828
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:44,540
I forgot to ask why you fell down

829
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:48,540
I only prepared to sit down

830
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:52,540
I knew I was not ready

831
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:56,540
I was hesitating

832
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:58,540
What are you doing?

833
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:02,540
I was hesitating for my selfish performance

834
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,540
I was looking down at the world

835
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,540
What are you doing? I don't know

836
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,540
I'm sorry

837
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:10,540
I'm sorry

838
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:12,540
I'm sorry

839
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,540
I'm sorry

840
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,540
I'm sorry

841
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,540
I'm sorry

842
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,540
I'm sorry

843
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:22,540
I'm sorry

844
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:24,540
I'm sorry

845
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,540
I'm sorry

846
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:28,540
I'm sorry

847
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:30,540
I'm sorry

848
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,540
I'm sorry

849
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,540
I'm sorry

850
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:36,540
This is my dad

851
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,540
We can't let you go

852
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,540
Your dad

853
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:42,540
I'm sorry

854
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,540
I'm sorry

855
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,540
I'm sorry

856
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,540
I'm sorry

857
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,540
I'm sorry

858
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:52,540
I'm sorry

859
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,540
I'm sorry

860
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,540
I'm sorry

861
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,540
You go

862
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,540
I'm sorry

863
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,540
I'm sorry

864
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:05,540
It's too hot.

865
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,540
It's so hot.

866
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,540
Chen Wan-Ti.

867
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,540
Handsome.

868
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,540
I'll take a picture for you.

869
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:20,540
From the mirror.

870
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:31,540
Beautiful to me.

871
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:33,540
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

872
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:35,540
I'm sorry.

873
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:37,540
I'm sorry.

874
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,540
I'm sorry.

875
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:41,540
I'm sorry.

876
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,540
I'm sorry.

877
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,540
I'm sorry.

878
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,540
Grandpa, I'm Yanny.

879
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,540
Hello.

880
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:53,540
Dad, this is Jiayun's friend.

881
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,540
Her name is Yanny.

882
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,540
She'll be taking care of you for the next two days.

883
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,540
She's very experienced.

884
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,540
She's just a fatter person.

885
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:04,540
But she loves to joke around when she's with me.

886
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:06,540
No problem, madam. I'll take care of grandpa.

887
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,540
I'll be back around 8 today.

888
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:10,540
It'll be a bit late, so I'm sorry.

889
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,540
Don't worry, madam.

890
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,540
I'll take care of grandpa.

891
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:16,540
Thank you.

892
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,540
Thank you, madam.

893
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,540
Grandpa, I'm Yanny.

894
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,540
I'm here to take care of you.

895
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,540
Don't be afraid.

896
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,540
What do you want to eat?

897
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:28,540
I've had experience as a tour guide before.

898
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,540
So I think

899
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,540
I'm very good at handling

900
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,540
the situations that come at you.

901
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:36,540
So you're experienced.

902
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,540
And you're good at handling crises.

903
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,540
Yes.

904
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,540
That's great. We need people like that the most.

905
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:44,540
Yes.

906
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,540
How did you come to think of me at this age?

907
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:49,540
Grandpa, I've taken care of many people.

908
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:52,540
So I understand your feelings.

909
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:56,540
I'll take good care of you here.

910
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,540
But I haven't seen my dad for a long time.

911
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,540
It's funny.

912
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,540
My dad didn't take care of me.

913
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,540
He's been taking care of other people's dads.

914
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:10,540
I'm sorry.

915
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,540
I'm sorry.

916
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,540
I'm sorry.

917
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,540
He's my dad.

918
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,540
I'll cook some porridge for you, okay?

919
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,540
I'll cook you some porridge.

920
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,540
I'll cook it for you.

921
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:46,540
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm out of my mind.

922
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:48,540
You're in the wrong station. What's wrong?

923
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:51,540
Madam, I just went down to ask Grandpa to help me.

924
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,540
I can't go in now.

925
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:55,540
Don't worry. Is he okay?

926
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,540
I... I don't know.

927
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,540
Okay, I'll be right back.

928
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,540
Don't run around at the door.

929
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,540
I'll be right back.

930
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,540
Okay.

931
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,540
I'll be right back.

932
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,540
I'll be right back.

933
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,540
I'll be right back.

934
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:13,540
I'll be right back.

935
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:15,540
I'll be right back.

936
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:17,540
Okay, bye.

937
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,540
They're back.

938
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:32,540
Hurry up and get some food.

939
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,540
Chen Guangqi!

940
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,540
They hit me!

941
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:43,540
I didn't hit Grandpa.

942
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,540
I didn't hit Grandpa.

943
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,540
I've been taking care of him all day.

944
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:49,540
I know. I'm sorry.

945
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,540
I think Grandpa really doesn't like me here.

946
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,540
No, he's just not used to it.

947
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,540
You know what's going on with him.

948
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:57,540
I'm sorry.

949
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,540
I know you didn't hit him.
