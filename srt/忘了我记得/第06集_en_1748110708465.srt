Dad, what's wrong?

4

I don't want to be a doctor anymore.

15
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Why are you saying this?

16
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Excuse me.

17
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000

Thank you.

20
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This is a medicine for relaxing the brain.

21
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
One before going to bed at night.

22
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And this is for the stomach.

23
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Okay.

36
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm a little crazy.

37
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You're a little crazy.

38
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You're a little crazy.

39

Are you going to get up?

40

Are you a little crazy?

41
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You always say I'm not that strong.

42
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The old man has a situation.

43
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm in a hurry.

44
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What does he have to do with me?

45
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
He didn't mean it.

46
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Or am I?

47
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Why are you so loud?

48
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Can you respect each other?

49
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The old man has a situation.

50
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I think it's funny when you say respect.

51
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Do you respect me?

52
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Okay, okay.

00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,540
and now, he's forcing us to work out his toe?

198
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,860
We can't work out the toe.

199
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,900
Why not? Off the price you'll pay.

200
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,300
Can you see it clearly?

201
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,740
You're going to raise the suture again?

202
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,860
Okay, I'm gonna go get it.

203
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,620
Where are you going with this senior?

204
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,260
This guy is so young and thinner than you.

205
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,520
You're still Mai Woo!

206
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,340
Sit on the floor.

207
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,860
man speaks Chinese

208
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,900
man continues muttering

209
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,660
man speaks Chinese

210
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,900
man speaks Chinese

211
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,300
Sit tight.

212
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,300
Your shoes are in your hands.

213
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,300
Help me help you put them on.

214
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,300
Sit tight.

215
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,300
Good.

216
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,300
I'm sorry.

217
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,300
I'm sorry.

218
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,300
I'm sorry.

219
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,300
I'm sorry.

220
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,300
I'm sorry.

221
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,300
I'm sorry.

222
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,300
I'm sorry.

223
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,300
I'm sorry.

224
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,300
I'm sorry.

225
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,300
I'm sorry.

226
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,300
I'm sorry.

227
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,300
I'm sorry.

228
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,300
I'm sorry.

229
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,300
I'm sorry.

230
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,300
I'm sorry.

231
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,300
I'm sorry.

232
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,300
I'm sorry.

233
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,300
I'm sorry.

234
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,300
I'm sorry.

235
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,300
I'm sorry.

236
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,300
I'm sorry.

237
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,300
I'm sorry.

238
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,300
I'm sorry.

239
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,300
I'm sorry.

240
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,300
I'm sorry.

241
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,300
I'm sorry.

242
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,300
I'm sorry.

243
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,300
I'm sorry.

244
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,300
I'm sorry.

245
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,300
I'm sorry.

246
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,300
I'm sorry.

247
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,300
I'm sorry.

248
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,300
I'm sorry.

249
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,300
I'm sorry.

250
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,300
I'm sorry.

251
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,300
I'm sorry.

252
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,300
I'm sorry.

253
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,300
I'm sorry.

254
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,300
I'm sorry.

255
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,300
I'm sorry.

256
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,300
I'm sorry.

257
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,300
I'm sorry.

258
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,300
I'm sorry.

259
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,300
I'm sorry.

260
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,300
I'm sorry.

261
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,300
I'm sorry.

262
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,300
I'm sorry.

263
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,300
I'm sorry.

264
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,300
I'm sorry.

265
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,220
war

266
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,300
Be careful, there is a ke.

267
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,300
Ok, stop moving.

268
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,300
your face is a bit tight.

269
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,300
Come on.

270
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:10,840
Hello.

271
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,340
Your feet are much better.

272
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,340
Much better.

273
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,340
Really?

274
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,340
Thank you.

275
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,340
The most tragic thing about divorce is

276
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,340
to change your emergency contact person

277
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,340
from husband to dad and mom.

278
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,340
But my dad has been

279
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,340
diagnosed with dementia recently.

280
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,340
The most inappropriate thing for him to do

281
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,340
is to deal with emergency situations.

282
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,340
If one day,

283
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,340
something happens and I go to the hospital,

284
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,340
Dr. Chen, I'm sorry,

285
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,340
your daughter is in the hospital.

286
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,340
Please come over right away.

287
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,340
Then my dad says,

288
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,340
you've found the wrong person.

289
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,340
Who is Mr. Chen?

290
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,340
I hung up.

291
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,340
Then I said,

292
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,340
Dad, wait a minute,

293
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,340
answer the phone.

294
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,380
Mom, I'm in Daxi.

295
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,380
Where's Mark?

296
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,380
He's gone.

297
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,380
But he doesn't seem to be happy.

298
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,380
Your break-up cannon today

299
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,380
is super high.

300
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,380
Great.

301
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,380
I'll hang up first.

302
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,380
Okay, you go first.

303
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,380
Hello.

304
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,380
Where are my underwear?

305
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,380
In the closet.

306
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,380
I can't find it.

307
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,380
I moved to the closet in the bathroom.

308
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,380
I told you not to touch my things.

309
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,380
Don't touch my things.

310
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,380
My things are where he should be.

311
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,420
You said you were coming back

312
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,420
to be my filial daughter.

313
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,420
You're filial.

314
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,420
I'm the one who's filial, not you.

315
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,420
Okay?

316
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,420
Then you don't wear it today.

317
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,420
No.

318
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,420
Or you'll wear it the other way around.

319
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,420
When are you off work?

320
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,420
What if I don't wear it every day?

321
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,420
It'll be empty.

322
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,460
It'll be empty.

323
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,460
You don't have to go to work.

324
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,460
It's so free.

325
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,460
Are your feet okay?

326
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,460
My feet are fine.

327
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,460
I lost my crutches.

328
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,460
It's better.

329
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,460
Don't run around.

330
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,460
Are you my mom or am I your dad?

331
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,460
I'm your dad.

332
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,460
I'm your mom.

333
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,500
Dad.

334
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,500
It seems you're fully recovered.

335
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
The picture is nice, right?

336
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,500
It's from the fortune teller.

337
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
The fortune teller has been down for a long time.

338
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,500
No.

339
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,500
I bought it from the fortune teller.

340
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,500
Dad, do you know where to go?

341
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,500
I'll go with you.

342
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,500
No need.

343
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,500
I went to the chest.

344
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,500
I...

345
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,500
I'll go with you.

346
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
It's nice, right?

347
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,500
It's nice.

348
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
I bought it.

349
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,500
Dad, what's for dinner this year?

350
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,500
It's New Year's Eve.

351
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,540
Oh, right.

352
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:39,540
I was going to buy red paper and write a new year's card.

353
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,540
Please don't write a new year's card.

354
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,540
No.

355
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,540
It's New Year's Eve.

356
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,540
It's not New Year's Eve if you don't eat New Year's Eve dinner.

357
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,540
Okay.

358
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,540
Come on.

359
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,540
Wait a minute.

360
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,540
You're taking medicine again?

361
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,540
That's a lot.

362
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,540
You'll have more after you stop eating.

363
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,540
Come on.

364
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,540
Okay.

365
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,540
You're so good.

366
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,540
It's nice, right?

367
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,540
I bought it first.

368
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,540
I'll go with you.

369
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,540
...very big.

370
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,540
Good and bad, and so on.

371
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,540
So, it's important to observe and take care of the environment.

372
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,540
Le Le,

373
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,540
why don't you go home and eat New Year's Eve dinner this year?

374
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,580
I told you I was going to work late.

375
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,580
It's New Year's Eve.

376
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,580
You have to work.

377
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,580
Late night shift is twice the salary.

378
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,580
You have to depend on yourself after you go home.

379
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,580
Okay, okay.

380
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,580
I'll go home now.

381
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,580
Le Le,

382
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,580
tell me,

383
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,580
what do you want for New Year's Eve?

384
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,620
Happy New Year.

385
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,620
Happy New Year.

386
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,620
Bye.

387
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,620
Bye.

388
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,660
Happy New Year.

389
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,660
Happy New Year.

390
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,660
Come to the center with your friends.

391
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,660
Say bye to our Mother Goddess.

392
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,660
Help yourself to pray.

393
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,660
Happy New Year.

394
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,660
Happy New Year.

395
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,660
Happy New Year.

396
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,700
Come on.

397
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,700
Why didn't I sleep well on New Year's Eve?

398
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,700
Happy New Year.

399
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,700
Go home and sleep.

400
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,700
Remember,

401
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,700
the luck will come when the luck is down.

402
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,700
The happiness will come when the luck is down.

403
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,700
That's how happiness comes.

404
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,700
Happy New Year.

405
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,700
Happy New Year.

406
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,700
Happy New Year.

407
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,700
Happy New Year.

408
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,700
Happy New Year.

409
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,700
Happy New Year.

410
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,700
Happy New Year.

411
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,700
Happy New Year.

412
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,700
Happy New Year.

413
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,700
Happy New Year.

414
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,700
Happy New Year.

415
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,700
Happy New Year.

416
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,700
Happy New Year.

Happy New Year.

Happy New Year.

Happy New Year.

00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,700
Happy New Year.

421
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,700
Happy New Year.

422
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,700
Happy New Year.

423
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,700
Happy New Year.

424
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,700
Happy New Year.

425
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,700
Happy New Year.

426
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,700
Happy New Year.

427
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,700
Happy New Year.

428
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,700
Happy New Year.

429
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,700
Happy New Year.

430
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,700
Happy New Year.

431
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,700
Happy New Year.

432
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,700
Happy New Year.

433
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,020
Does anyone want pork belly?

434
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,020
Hey Pony,

435
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,020
what would you like?

436
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,020
I'd like pork belly.

437
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,020
Pork belly?

438
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,020
It's red.

439
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:32,520
It's

440
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,520
medications.

441
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:28,520
ё

442
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,600
sn

443
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:57,700
Here is the

444
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,700
The boss is very good at cooking.

445
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,700
He's very good at cooking.

446
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,700
He's a very good cook.

447
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,700
He's a very good cook.

448
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,700
He's a very good cook.

449
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,700
Ta-da!

450
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,700
Beef roll with beef.

451
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,700
Red fire tomato noodles.

452
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,700
Flower-shaped rich chicken.

453
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,700
Fried noodles with all kinds of ingredients.

454
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,700
Fried noodles with all kinds of ingredients.

455
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,700
This...

456
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,700
Yuan Wei.

457
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,700
My order is egg rice.

458
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,700
You've been cooking for the whole afternoon.

459
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,700
It's pretty good.

460
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,700
You don't like instant noodles, do you?

461
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,700
You don't like instant noodles, do you?

462
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,700
You know you've been cooking for me all day.

463
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,700
I only know how to cook this.

464
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,700
I only know how to cook this.

465
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,700
Okay, pick one you like.

466
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,700
Okay, pick one you like.

467
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,700
I...

468
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,700
I'll pick this one.

469
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,700
You're eating Yuan Wei. Are you playing with me?

470
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,700
No, no.

471
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,700
Yuan Wei is good. Yuan Wei is good.

472
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,700
You've made it so complicated before.

473
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,700
I'm afraid you don't have enough nutrition.

474
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,700
It's pretty good.

475
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,700
Really?

476
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,700
Oh, mom's cooking smells so good.

477
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,700
Okay, let's eat.

478
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,700
She's getting ready to eat.

479
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,700
Come, let's put the toys away.

480
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,700
It's okay.

481
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,700
It's okay.

482
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,700
Come, come.

483
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,700
Mom's coming.

484
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,700
Hey, baby.

485
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,700
Do you remember the ride we played earlier?

486
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,700
You and Suo Suo.

487
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,700
You and Suo Suo. You're here.

488
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,700
Mom,

489
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,700
Mom,

490
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,700
Happy New Year.

491
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,700
Have you eaten your New Year's Eve meal?

492
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,700
I'll take a picture for my grandpa and grandma.

493
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,700
I'll take a picture for my grandpa and grandma.

494
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,700
Look at me.

495
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,700
Happy New Year.

496
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,700
Hey, let's go on a trip next year.

497
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,700
Why do they play the same game every year?

498
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,700
Yeah, it's not bad.

499
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,700
But that one...

500
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,700
That one...

501
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,700
It's not bad.

502
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,700
The situation is pretty good.

503
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,700
It's funny inside.

504
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

505
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,700
Happy New Year.

506
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,700
Happy New Year.

507
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,700
Wait a minute.

508
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,700
For me?

509
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,700
Yeah.

510
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,700
Happy New Year.

511
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,700
Happy New Year.

512
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,700
Thank you.

513
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,700
Thank you.

514
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,700
That's great.

515
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,700
It's a little thin.

516
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,700
Don't say that, okay?

517
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,700
It feels like the world of Chu Men.

518
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,700
But the scarier thing is

519
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,700
that you're in this world

520
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,700
and you can't get out of it alive.

521
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,700
Call.

522
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,700
Call.

523
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,700
Call.

524
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,700
And these old people...

525
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,700
Boss Chen.

526
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,700
Yeah.

527
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,700
It sounds really scary.

528
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,700
But it's a real place.

529
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,700
Do you know that there's a place in Holland

530
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,700
called Hogweichun?

531
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,700
It's actually a nursing home.

532
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,700
And it's all seriously lost

533
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,700
old people living in it.

534
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,700
It sounds very cruel.

535
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,700
It sounds...

536
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,700
Because they actually

537
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,700
know nothing about the world around them.

538
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,700
And they're being monitored

539
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,700
and watched for 24 hours.

540
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,700
The people next to them are medical staff.

541
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,700
But these old people don't know.

542
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,700
They're being monitored and

543
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,700
summoned every day.

544
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,700
They're very happy.

545
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,700
Especially when they buy things.

546
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,700
Especially when they buy things.

547
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,700
They don't have to pay.

548
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,700
Lip balm.

549
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,700
Cash.

550
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,700
When they get to the cashier,

551
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,700
they say, you don't have to pay.

552
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,700
You paid last time.

553
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,700
It's like the world of Chu Men.

554
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,700
Ugh.

555
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,700
Hi.

556
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,700
Hello.

557
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,700
Hello.

558
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,700
Oh, handsome.

559
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,700
Why are you coming in when you have time?

560
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,700
Jiayun.

561
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,700
I'm Shu Fei.

562
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,700
Hi.

563
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,700
Hi.

564
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,700
You want a cup?

565
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,700
Let me get you a cup.

566
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,700
What cup?

567
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,700
You're so big.

568
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,700
Wait, let me take a look.

569
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,700
Do you want to drink?

570
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,700
Drink.

571
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,700
What do you want to drink?

572
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,700
Your dad is really good with kids.

573
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,700
He's a good kid.

574
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,700
I got a coupon a few days ago.

575
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,700
A good house with a good view.

576
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,700
And you can also soak in the hot spring.

577
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,700
It's only 60% off.

578
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,700
Let's go on a trip.

579
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,700
Can I bring two kids?

580
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,700
Can I bring an old one?

581
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,700
What? You're going to soak in the hot spring?

582
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,700
You're so funny.

583
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,700
I really have time to chat.

584
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,700
No wonder I'm always single.

585
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,700
If it's the day when I come back,

586
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,700
I can force myself to come back.

587
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,700
Can I ask my mother-in-law to bring the kids?

588
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,700
I can do that too.

589
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,700
Right, I'm forcing myself.

590
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,700
I'm the one who ordered the food.

591
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,700
You're still not here.

592
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,700
You're still not willing to promise me.

593
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,700
Forget it.

594
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,700
No.

595
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,700
Where's the watermelon?

596
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,700
No.

597
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,700
I'm sorry.

598
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,700
We're busy right now.

599
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,700
We're not with you.

600
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,700
Do you think we've become boring?

601
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,700
How can I be boring in real life?

602
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,700
Right.

603
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,700
You all have a house to talk about.

604
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,700
Do I have a house to talk about?

605
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,700
Lonely.

606
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,700
Because the water is boiling.

607
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,700
Lonely.

608
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,700
Right?

609
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,700
I want to give you some.

610
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,700
I want to take it home.

611
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,700
I want to take it home.

612
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,700
I'm not saying I want to drink it.

613
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,700
Okay, I'll open it for you.

614
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,700
Wait.

615
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,700
I'll open it for you.

616
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,700
I want it too.

617
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,700
Be careful with the food you eat.

618
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,700
Don't get it pressed.

619
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,700
I've prepared everything for you.

620
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,700
I've put it in the fridge.

621
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,700
You're hungry.

622
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,700
You can eat it when it's hot.

623
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,700
Okay.

624
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,700
Remember to take your medicine.

625
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,700
I've put it in the medicine box.

626
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,700
I've written down

627
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,700
the person you need to contact.

628
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,700
I've put it in the fridge and the bathroom.

629
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,700
I've told your mom.

630
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,700
If you need anything,

631
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,700
contact us or her.

632
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,700
Okay?

633
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,700
Dad.

634
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,700
Dad.

635
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,700
Aren't you coming back tomorrow?

636
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,700
Yes.

637
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,700
I'll be back tomorrow.

638
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,700
Mom, dad.

639
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,700
Your driver is here.

640
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,700
Remember to eat and take your medicine.

641
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,700
I'll be back soon.

642
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,700
I'll be here at the emergency contact.

643
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,700
Bye, I'll bring you something delicious.

644
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,700
Hurry up.

645
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,700
I've been waiting for a long time.

646
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,700
Hurry up.

647
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,700
I've been waiting for a long time.

648
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,700
I'm coming.

649
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,700
Hurry up.

650
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,700
Okay.

651
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,700
Bye, mom.

652
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,700
I'll be back soon.

653
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,700
Take care of your daughter.

654
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,700
Bye.

655
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,700
Mom.

656
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,700
Is your brother back?

657
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,700
He's back.

658
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,700
You're still in the shower.

659
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,700
Really?

660
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,700
How did you get back to Zhang Kai?

661
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,700
He didn't come back.

662
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,700
I don't have a new ideal brother.

663
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,700
I know.

664
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,700
You know?

665
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,700
You don't know.

666
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,700
I don't even know.

667
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,700
You're a happy single woman.

668
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,700
How do you know our love?

669
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,700
I have my troubles.

670
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,700
Like what?

671
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,700
I'm not so obvious today.

672
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,700
I've never lied.

673
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,700
You can't compare your pain.

674
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,700
Of course I can.

675
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,700
All the pain is compared.

676
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,700
The pain of having a baby.

677
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,700
The pain of being helpless.

678
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,700
The pain of spending the New Year with your mother-in-law.

679
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,700
You're so ungrateful.

680
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,700
You'll never understand.

681
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,700
What time is it?

682
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,700
Should I talk to my son?

683
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,700
No.

684
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,700
I'll call my dad.

685
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,700
No.

686
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,700
We've only been here for three hours.

687
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,700
The skin is all rotted.

688
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,700
Only five minutes.

689
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,700
Then let's soak it for another 20 seconds.

690
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,700
Handsome, do you miss me?

691
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,700
Do you miss mom?

692
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,700
What are you eating today?

693
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,700
Dad made me ice cream.

694
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,700
It's delicious.

695
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,700
It's delicious.

696
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,700
It's sweet and delicious.

697
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,700
But it's cold today.

698
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,700
Your dad is not afraid of you.

699
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,700
And remember to eat sugar.

700
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,700
How about seven hours?

701
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,700
I'm not tall.

702
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,700
I'm sorry.

703
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,700
I'll see mom today.

704
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,700
You should go to bed early.

705
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,700
Don't play with your phone in front of the child.

706
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,700
You're so scary.

707
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,700
You scared the man away.

708
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,700
I'm not.

709
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,700
I don't even go home when I'm older.

710
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,700
You don't go home?

711
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,700
You take your girlfriend home?

712
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,700
I can't remember.

713
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,700
What did I do with my mask?

714
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,700
You're so old.

715
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,700
It's so late.

716
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,700
It feels so good to be a housewife.

717
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,700
I've thought about it.

718
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,700
If I could be like this,

719
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,700
I would have a good time with my dad.

720
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,700
I would have a good time with Zhang Hai.

721
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,700
I would have a good time with Zhang Hai.

722
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,700
I don't know.

723
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,700
I'm not right.

724
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,700
But if I have a brother and sister,

725
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,700
I won't have to worry about it.

726
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,700
At least I won't be so worried.

727
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,700
I'm so tired.

728
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,700
Let's not talk about these unhappy things.

729
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,700
Let's not talk about these unhappy things.

730
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,700
Cheers.

731
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,700
I'll bring you some wine.

732
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,700
I'll bring you some wine.

733
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,700
I'm sorry.

734
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,700
I'm sorry.

735
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,700
Hello?

736
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,700
Hello?

737
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,700
Yes?

738
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,700
Hello?

739
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,700
Yes?

740
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,700
Yes.

741
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,700
No.

742
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,700
No.

743
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,700
No.

744
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,700
No.

745
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,700
It's okay.

746
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,700
It's okay.

747
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,700
I'm sorry.

748
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,700
Can you help me with this?

749
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,700
Sure.

750
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,700
How's your wife?

751
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,700
She's still in the hospital.

752
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,700
Is your family here?

753
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,700
Chen Guangpi's family!

754
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,700
Chen Guangpi's family is here!

755
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,700
I... I'm...

756
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,700
Chen Guangpi's family is here!

757
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,700
Okay, then can you help me carry this?

758
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,700
Sure.

759
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,700
Are you her family?

760
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,700
Yes.

761
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,700
Do you know what happened?

762
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,700
I don't know.

763
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,700
I'm not by her side.

764
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,700
Okay.

765
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,700
She might have a stroke

766
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,700
and her breathing is weak.

767
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,700
We'll have to help her with that.

768
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,700
Do you know what kind of chronic disease she had?

769
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,700
Is it really chronic?

770
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,700
Yes.

771
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,700
Have you discussed the situation

772
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,700
of not performing a heart transplant?

773
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,700
Okay, I'll show you this list.

774
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,700
You can tell us after you think about it.

775
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,700
Okay.

776
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,700
The end

777
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,700
To live

778
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,700
is the most basic thing you can do as a human being.

779
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,700
We've learned for a lifetime,

780
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,700
and we've followed it for a lifetime.

781
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,700
Now,

782
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,700
whether we want to live or not

783
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,700
can we only depend on the signature of another person?

784
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:54,520
I don't want to be a

785
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,700
person.

786
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,700
I don't want to be a person.

787
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,700
I don't want to be a person.

788
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,700
I don't want to be a person.

789
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,700
I don't want to be a person.

790
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,700
I don't want to be a person.

791
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,700
I don't want to be a person.

792
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,700
I don't want to be a person.

793
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,700
I don't want to be a person.

794
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,700
I don't want to be a person.

795
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,700
I don't want to be a person.

796
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,700
I don't want to be a person.

797
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,700
I don't want to be a person.

798
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,700
I don't want to be a person.

799
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,700
I don't want to be a person.

800
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,700
I don't want to be a person.

801
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,700
I don't want to be a person.

802
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,700
I don't want to be a person.

803
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,700
I don't want to be a person.

804
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,700
I don't want to be a person.

805
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:45,100
We listen to the radio in the rain.

806
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:55,100
We take a stroll among the faces of life to come.

807
00:40:55,100 --> 00:41:02,100
We sit at the table in peace, sparring our pricks.

808
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:11,100
We lay on the green meadows and look upon the crescent moon.

809
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:21,100
We hear the morning prayer chanted for the cure.

810
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:29,100
We watch the stars order themselves into the midsummer night.

811
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:40,100
We lean by the counter and steal a long slow kiss.

812
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:52,100
We sing in the forest under the twilight that steals the colors from the sky.

813
00:41:52,100 --> 00:42:17,100
And all this world's confusion and disarray, how extraordinary an ordinary life is.

814
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:26,100
Whether good or bad, it is our ordinary day.

815
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:30,100
Whether good or bad.

816
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:58,100
And all this world's confusion and disarray, how extraordinary an ordinary life is.

817
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:07,100
Whether good or bad, it is our ordinary day.

818
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:11,100
Whether good or bad.

819
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:23,100
It's our precious ordinary day.

820
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:33,100
It's our precious ordinary day.

821
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:37,100
It's our precious ordinary day.

822
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:41,100
It's our precious ordinary day.

823
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:45,100
It's our precious ordinary day.

824
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:48,100
It's our precious ordinary day.

825
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,100
It's our precious ordinary day.

826
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:55,100
It's our precious ordinary day.
