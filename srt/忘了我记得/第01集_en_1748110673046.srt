3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,780
Bye-bye.

4
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,420
I'm leaving now.

5
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,180
Bye-bye.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Have you ever walked through it?

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Have you ever walked through so much?

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We kept looking out.

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We thought we would be held by something by accident.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
When we looked back, we realized

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
we seemed to have lost something.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Did we lose ourselves

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
or get lost in them?

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Have you ever been lost by your dad?

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
No.

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You haven't been lost by your dad?

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Come on, give me your hand.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So many?

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You haven't been lost by your dad?

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
No.

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You don't have a dad?

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm just kidding.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
When I was 6 or 7 years old,

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I was a little girl.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I was a little girl.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I was a little girl.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
When I was 6 or 7 years old,

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I went to a market near my house with my dad.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I was so excited.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I was looking at this and that.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
There were so many inside.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Why?

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I turned around and looked.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
There was only one left in my heart.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Why?

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That is, why is my dad gone?

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Dad!

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Dad!

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
For a 7 or 8-year-old girl,

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I really think the world is ruined.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Dad!

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What makes me the most angry is that

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I finally saw him across the street.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Then he gave me an expression.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
He lost his daughter to buy a cup of peach juice.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
My value is not just a cup of peach juice.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And he is very unlike a dad.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You know, as his daughter,

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
he succeeded in the show for me on the wedding day.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Honey, help me call Shao Shao.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'll go talk to him.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I have to go find Le Le.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Wait a minute.

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Let me tell you.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Our classmates were so bad at math.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Oh, you're not here?

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay, okay.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Thank you.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Thank you, Sister Chen.

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Thank you.

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's been a long time.

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Bye, sister.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I can't find him.

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He's not at home.

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The neighbor said he saw a car leaving two hours ago.

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Car?

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That should be soon.

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
A bicycle.

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Maybe there's another one.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's okay.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Relax.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
We can yeah.

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Hello.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Hello.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,200
What's going on?

79
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,720
I see.

80
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,960
This is Zhang Ba Zhang.

81
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,000
Let's welcome Zhang Ba Zhang.

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,800
Come on.

83
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,880
I bet your parents will think this wedding is a disaster.

84
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,040
Don't think too much.

85
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Your parents have no objection to our marriage.

86
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,800
They have.

87
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,040
They just said,

88
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,720
you can decide.

89
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,040
But they thought you should listen to me.

90
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,880
It makes no sense.

91
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,160
Don't be so arrogant.

92
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,960
Relax.

93
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,440
Okay?

94
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,880
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,720
I'm really feeling...

96
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,800
And I think my skin is so dry.

97
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,120
What's wrong?

98
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,040
Why is this brother so stubborn?

99
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,080
I don't want to be parted from you.

100
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,200
You're beautiful.

101
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,480
What's wrong with me?

102
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,080
You're beautiful.

103
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,800
I'm so hungry.

104
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,280
I'm beautiful.

105
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,960
I'm hungry too.

106
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,480
Yeah.

107
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,200
You don't know that for today,

108
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,480
Huang Shu Fei only eats wild vegetables and chicken for one month.

109
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:32,960
How's it?

110
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
It's good, right?

111
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,320
What?

112
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,360
It's done?

113
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,920
Why did you post it on the photo?

114
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,800
Someone asked for it.

115
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,240
I should know my responsibility.

116
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,960
Anyway, you don't want to get married.

117
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,200
I want to feel like I'm being chased.

118
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,560
Why haven't you come yet?

119
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,480
Did I tell you that

120
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,920
you should take your dad out with you?

121
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,560
She's the bride today.

122
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,120
Great.

123
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,040
This video is so touching.

124
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,840
She hasn't arrived yet.

125
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,400
Yeah.

126
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,840
She hasn't arrived yet.

127
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,360
Le Le.

128
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,560
She must have been blessed for eight lifetimes

129
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,720
to be able to marry our groom, Zhang Kai.

130
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,920
What?

131
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,920
We can see her story on her body.

132
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,760
It's a very good example.

133
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,880
Chou Xiao Ya.

134
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,800
Miss Hui.

135
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,960
In this real world,

136
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
this will happen.

137
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,720
Ye Kuan.

138
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,000
Are you okay?

139
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,320
True love has no distance.

140
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,320
Who found the host?

141
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,720
You can't find this when you get married.

142
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,400
Listen.

143
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,520
The other table.

144
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,680
The other table is all the lawyers.

145
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,560
You can find them when you get divorced.

146
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,480
Okay.

147
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,880
You can use the wine on the table.

148
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,720
The wine that's not on the table.

149
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,760
How's it?

150
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,680
Going in and out.

151
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,000
Doesn't look good.

152
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,440
What did you say?

153
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,880
Doesn't look good.

154
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,400
Then check out the result.

155
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,520
I didn't hand in.

156
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,680
That's wrong.

157
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,200
We watched the receipt

158
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,720
and well said it didn't work.

159
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,280
Yes, that's right.

160
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,240
affe and...

161
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,480
I Hear a din of wine

162
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,280
on the table.

163
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,080
It should be right about now.

164
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,880
Yeah.

165
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,400
Let it go.

166
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,400
I need to cut my hair.

167
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,400
Which side?

168
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
How are you all doing today?

169
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
Sorry.

170
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
I am Lele.

171
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,400
Thank you all for coming to my wedding.

172
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,400
Some people say that

173
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,400
if you have a very rough parents,

174
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,400
usually their children will be very strict and responsible.

175
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,400
I am a very cautious and reliable person.

176
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,400
I am a person who has a very good plan.

177
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,400
So everyone can think of me as a father.

178
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,400
So, I will take this opportunity to take a break.

179
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,400
I will introduce my best friend from university.

180
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,400
Lin Jiayun and Huang Sufei.

181
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,400
Thank you all.

182
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,400
And my colleagues at work.

183
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,400
We are not in a good mood for 24 hours.

184
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,400
It's like we can't beat the future.

185
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
What are you talking about?

186
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,400
Hanghang is a top student.

187
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,400
Of course, there are people who can change my mind.

188
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Zhang Kai.

189
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,400
Thank you.

190
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,400
Thank you.

191
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,400
Thank you.

192
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,400
My best friend can testify for me.

193
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Before I met her,

194
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,400
I never thought about getting married.

195
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,400
I have to thank my mother.

196
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,400
When I was 8 years old, she left me.

197
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Then she went to the US to travel the world.

198
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,400
She used the most powerful voice to tell me

199
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,400
that marriage is the tomb of love.

200
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Or a mess.

201
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,400
If you have married many times.

202
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Anyway, this person made me take the risk

203
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
to cross the wild and barren land

204
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,400
to step into the tomb of love.

205
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,400
Is that sentence used like that?

206
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,400
It seems that the white tomb is a legend.

207
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,400
Luckily, he doesn't have to tell his uncle.

208
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
You know what?

209
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,400
I bought a house for his baby son.

210
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
I know.

211
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,400
I don't have it.

212
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Hanghang, open it.

213
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
Thank you.

214
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,400
My father, Chen Guangqi.

215
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
Thank you.

216
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Come in.

217
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Hello.

218
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
Do you have a patient named Chen Guangqi?

219
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Chen what?

220
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,400
Chen Guangqi.

221
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
He's bright and neat.

222
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
The second bed is behind.

223
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,400
Do you know why the hen shivers?

224
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,400
I don't know.

225
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,400
This is more funny.

226
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,400
Chen Guangqi.

227
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,400
You're exaggerating.

228
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Do you know what day it is?

229
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
It's my daughter Lele.

230
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,400
She's married today.

231
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Congratulations.

232
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Thank you.

233
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,400
She's beautiful.

234
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,400
Where's Kai?

235
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,400
He's still marrying her.

236
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,400
Good things don't come in pairs.

237
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Bad things come in pairs.

238
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,400
My father went to the hospital like he went to the kitchen.

239
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
He was scared to death.

240
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,400
But yesterday,

241
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
it was yesterday.

242
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Do you know why the hen shivers?

243
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
I don't know.

244
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,400
The hen shivers.

245
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,400
How many doctors are you going to tell about this silly joke?

246
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,400
He's very nice.

247
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
I'm sorry.

248
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,400
This time, it's really bad.

249
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,400
It's not that.

250
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
I told them to find

251
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,400
the best surgeon to sew it for me.

252
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
It's very well sewn.

253
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,400
It's not hurt at all.

254
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
How handsome is he this time?

255
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,400
I saw a very cute puppy.

256
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
I'm sorry.

257
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,400
We have to wait for Chen's parents to leave.

258
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,400
The doctor will send you the situation later.

259
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,400
I know.

260
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,400
Thank you.

261
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
You just got off work.

262
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
This is...

263
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
Thank you.

264
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,400
You're so good.

265
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,400
Miss Chen.

266
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
Yes?

267
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,400
Chen's father may have early dementia.

268
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,400
We suggest that the family may have to take a lot of measures.

269
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,400
I'm sorry.

270
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,400
We suggest that the family should pay more attention to the day

271
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,400
and not let the elders live alone.

272
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
When dad came just now,

273
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
he couldn't remember the address of the house.

274
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
Fortunately, I put your name card on him.

275
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,400
We suggest that we should check it next time we come back.

276
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,400
Is it because he hit his head?

277
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,400
We have a check, but it should be fine at first glance.

278
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,400
But if the elders in the family often fall,

279
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
we should pay special attention to that.

280
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
For example, he may feel unfamiliar with the space

281
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,400
or his ability to descend.

282
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,400
So next time we have to do a special check.

283
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,400
Doctor, I think it's unlikely.

284
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,400
You know, my dad is naughty.

285
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,400
So I'm not suffering from dementia.

286
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,400
I'm really sorry.

287
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,400
Naughty?

288
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,400
Yes, he's just pretending.

289
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
He usually jumps around and likes to say some cold jokes.

290
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,400
Miss Chen,

291
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
how long have you not seen your dad?

292
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
About

293
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,400
two, three months, three, four months.

294
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
Do you live far from here?

295
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,400
No, but...

296
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,400
I've been busy recently.

297
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,400
It's okay, I understand.

298
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,400
I have some information about dementia

299
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,400
that I can show you.

300
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
Sir,

301
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,400
don't treat this place as your own home.

302
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,400
It sounds nice.

303
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,400
Next time they call you,

304
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
just tell them you're not here.

305
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
Or you're abroad.

306
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
When you were little,

307
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
the school called me and said you were sick.

308
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
I didn't go right away.

309
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,400
You're doing well now.

310
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
You're so stubborn.

311
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
I want to be stubborn too.

312
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,400
You like to be a fool.

313
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
Listen,

314
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
if the sky falls,

315
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,400
there are tall trees on top.

316
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,400
What if the tall trees are as unreliable as you

317
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
and suddenly fall?

318
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
Are there aliens?

319
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,400
You're with them.

320
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,400
I'm waiting for them to pick me up.

321
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,400
Childish.

322
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,400
Being childish for the rest of your life is also an achievement.

323
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
What? I don't need it.

324
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
I'll go get it.

325
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
Do you know

326
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
why I put the newspaper on the floor

327
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
when I was sick?

328
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,400
I don't want to know about your illness.

329
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
Let's go.

330
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
I usually wear old-fashioned glasses.

331
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,400
They're nice.

332
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,400
Why do you wear old-fashioned glasses?

333
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,400
I'm a far-sighted person.

334
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,400
I don't care.

335
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,400
I put the name card on the fridge.

336
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,400
Forget it.

337
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,400
Let's walk back.

338
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
There's no car.

339
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,400
Wait.

340
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,400
Listen.

341
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,400
Wait. I'm going back to the message.

342
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,400
You're busy.

343
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,400
Do you remember

344
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,400
where you took a pink bicycle when you were little?

345
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,400
It was a few hundred years ago.

346
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,400
That bicycle was blue.

347
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
Look.

348
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,400
You don't take pictures of pigeons.

349
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,400
And that bicycle must be pink.

350
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,400
You don't remember anything.

351
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
You're worse than me.

352
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
Why do you remember something so important?

353
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
I can't remember anything now.

354
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,400
I just broke up with your mom.

355
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
You mean Wang Xiao Fang?

356
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
He left home.

357
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,400
You two broke up.

358
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,400
You didn't talk for half a year.

359
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,400
You made me anxious.

360
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
I took you to the doctor,

361
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
the temple, the hospital,

362
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
and the church.

363
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,400
You didn't talk to me except for dinner.

364
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Did I?

365
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400
And then?

366
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
I went to school to pick you up every day.

367
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,400
You went to school to pick me up every day?

368
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,400
You must have forgotten that.

369
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
After I picked you up,

370
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,400
we walked around.

371
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,400
As we walked,

372
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
I kept talking to you.

373
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
I kept talking to you.

374
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
One day,

375
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
you started talking to me.

376
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,400
What did I say?

377
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
I forgot.

378
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,400
I was thinking of what to say.

379
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
I think I was talking too much.

380
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,400
I'm sorry.

381
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,400
I've been very busy lately.

382
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,400
I have to go to the toilet.

383
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,400
I have to go to the toilet now.

384
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,400
See you later.

385
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,400
I will go with you.

386
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,400
I'm so sorry.

387
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,400
I'm so sorry.

388
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,400
I'm so sorry.

389
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,400
I'm so sorry.

390
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,400
I'm so sorry.

391
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,400
I'm so sorry.

392
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,400
I'm sorry.

393
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,800
I'm going home soon.

394
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,000
Don't worry. I'm not cooking for you.

395
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,800
I've made an appointment with Old Tang and the others last week.

396
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,600
I'm going to bring some side dishes for Old Zhang and Qing Sheng.

397
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,000
You have side dishes too?

398
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You're really getting more and more things.

399
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I don't.

400
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Dad, Uncle Zhang's birthday is two weeks ago.

401
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,600
It's possible. You must have mistaken.

402
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,200
It's next week.

403
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,800
You wrote it on your calendar. Go and read it.

404
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,600
No way.

405
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,200
It's obvious that Uncle Wen told me last week.

406
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,200
Uncle Wen has been away for a long time.

407
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,800
Huh?

408
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,660
The

409
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,000
This is too much room.

410
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,200
Uncle, come and help me.

411
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,600
What?

412
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,400
Come on.

413
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,200
Help me clean this table.

414
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,000
Take these two away.

415
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,400
Put them there.

416
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,000
Okay.

417
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,600
You're really...

418
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,400
Put the TV on.

419
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,200
Here.

420
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,000
I told you not to cook for me.

421
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,600
I didn't even finish writing this afternoon. I'm going home to write.

422
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,600
You should have eaten earlier.

423
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,800
Eating those side dishes is bad for your health.

424
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,000
Yes.

425
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,800
Eating instant noodles is good for your health.

426
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,800
Wait.

427
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,800
It's okay.

428
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,000
You cooked so much. Who can finish it?

429
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
If you can't finish it, take it back to Zhang Kai.

430
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Sir, I'm already separated from Zhang Kai.

431
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You're really a dementia.

432
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,600
Don't worry.

433
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,400
I'm not going to need you to take care of me.

434
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,200
I didn't say I wanted to take care of you.

435
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,200
And also,

436
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,200
the dining table is a place to eat, not a place to pile up things.

437
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,400
Isn't that obvious?

438
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,600
You can take anything you want.

439
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,800
Is it good?

440
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,200
I don't like instant noodles.

441
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,400
I'm going home after eating some.

442
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,200
If I can't finish it tomorrow,

443
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,800
I'll kill myself.

444
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm going to work.

445
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,800
Don't watch TV too late.

446
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,800
Don't watch TV too late. Bye.

447
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
Bye.

448
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,800
Old people like my dad who are stuck in front of the TV every day,

449
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:30,400
have they forgotten how busy their 40-year-old life is?

450
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,000
They can only rush around every day.

451
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,400
Not to mention instant noodles.

452
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,000
They even dare to make a cup of coffee.

453
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,800
Hello, welcome.

454
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,800
Hello, do you need a bag?

455
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,400
No.

456
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,200
Let's brush separately.

457
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,800
I think I'm speaking Chinese.

458
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,600
Brush separately.

459
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,400
You mean we should brush separately?

460
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,200
Yes, brush separately.

461
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,400
Okay.

462
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,800
What's the number of members?

463
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,800
0963, 763, 441.

464
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,000
441, not 411.

465
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Okay, sorry.

466
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,800
441.

467
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,000
Okay, yes. 0963.

468
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,600
763.

469
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,600
441.

470
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,200
Okay.

471
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,800
Please confirm again.

472
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,000
May I ask how to pay?

473
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,800
Cash.

474
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
I'll pay the bill for you.

475
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,600
Will you please pass the bill?

476
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,000
Thanks, I'll take my answer.

477
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,400
With you as my support, I don't have to feel sorry.

478
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,400
For pocket money, I didn't get my classmate class.

479
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,300
Draw 2 sets of numbers correct if 1, 2, 3...

480
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,500
1, 06...

481
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,000
Oh my god!

482
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,600
picture head?

483
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,400
Here is the picture head.

484
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,800
A rolling pin and she functions as a handle.

485
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,000
You have to send me a ticket

486
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,680
I...

487
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,600
Send me a ticket

488
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
Send me a ticket

489
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Send me a ticket

490
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,600
Are you out of your mind?

491
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,800
The whole world is waiting for you

492
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,000
The store is a retail store, not a service company

493
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,200
You're kneeling down to help you pay the bill

494
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,000
You can't tell the truth when you're in love

495
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,800
That's right. I'm a fool

496
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,800
I'm sorry

497
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,800
I might have made some mistakes

498
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,800
So I'll help you return the product

499
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,800
And then I'll send you the ticket

500
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,600
Okay?

501
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,800
I'm sorry

502
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,800
Thank you

503
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,000
Yo, sisters

504
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,800
Hi

505
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,200
I arrived on time yesterday

506
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,800
You're not here yet?

507
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,800
You're missing one person lately

508
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
I've been talking nonsense lately

509
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,800
I'm pregnant again

510
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
Stop cursing me

511
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,800
My life's goal is to live a life without breastfeeding

512
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,800
So I can be in my own world

513
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,800
Wait for me

514
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,800
My dad is in the hospital

515
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,800
I have to say, Reba is really a tough guy

516
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,800
How is he?

517
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,800
He got a few stitches on his forehead

518
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,800
He even asked a doctor to do it for him

519
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
Do you think he's good?

520
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,800
He's really handsome

521
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,400
He really knows how to do it

522
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
But he didn't get a bone

523
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,400
Yanni, don't throw that away

524
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,400
That's my breast milk

525
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,400
Why did you use such weird words?

526
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,400
That way, Yanni would understand

527
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,400
Did you say you wanted to throw away the breast milk?

528
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,400
No, I said I didn't want to throw it away

529
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,400
You guys still want me to drink two cups?

530
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,400
Sure, it's Belize milk

531
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,400
So annoying

532
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,400
Breast milk is precious, you know that?

533
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,400
You have to freeze it first

534
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,400
So you can make a bathrobe

535
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,400
Mom

536
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,400
The breast milk you made last time was really good

537
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Please make a few more this time

538
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
It's really good, right?

539
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
Mom, play with me

540
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,400
Wait, I'll call you later

541
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
Mom, what's going on?

542
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,400
What?

543
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,400
No, I can't see it

544
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,400
I can see it clearly

545
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,400
Is this a flower?

546
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,400
Hurry up, what do you want to eat to eat a flower?

547
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,400
It's a cure for all the diseases

548
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,400
My baby is so little

549
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,400
You have to recommend some night-yellow food every day

550
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,400
And then we have gassan, anti-bacterial acid and DHA

551
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Protect your eyes

552
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,400
Wait, I can't remember

553
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
I'll go get it

554
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,400
Do you have any recommendation?

555
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,400
Yes, I do

556
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,400
Change your breast milk suit

557
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,400
Let's go to work

558
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,400
I'll go back to work

559
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,400
Talk to you later

560
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
Mimi, okay

561
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,400
I'm going to eat

562
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,400
Okay

563
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,400
Hello, welcome

564
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,400
Auntie, give me a hot latte

565
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Auntie? Who are you calling Auntie?

566
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,400
An

567
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,400
Yes, hot latte

568
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,400
Okay, big or medium?

569
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,400
Big, thank you

570
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,400
Okay

571
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,400
Thank you

572
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,400
Why do I have so many stupid questions?

573
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,400
What questions?

574
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,400
Tell me

575
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,400
What time does the journey start every day?

576
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,400
Is there a washing machine in European restaurants?

577
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
Why can't I sit on the sidewalk?

578
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,400
Can't I live with my friends?

579
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,400
Why don't you use your brain when you ask questions?

580
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,400
Think about it, I'll ask

581
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,400
Calm down

582
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,400
There's a page

583
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,400
It's a group of people we met when we were in the group

584
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:49,320
They were famous,

585
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,320
I'm done

586
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,320
Thank you, Yanny

587
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,320
You've been cleaning for a long time

588
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,320
Because Mr. Hui is back

589
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,320
Mom said the house wasn't clean enough

590
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,320
It would be nice if Le was still in the group

591
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,320
Yes, there are no guests that she can't control

592
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,320
Except

593
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,320
I heard that she was in every group for making money

594
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,320
Amazing

595
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,320
Yes, she wanted to go to the US group

596
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,320
America?

597
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,320
Why?

598
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Who told you?

599
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,320
I don't want to tell you

600
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,320
Think about it

601
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,320
Is it easier to make money?

602
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,320
Here

603
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,320
Where is my son?

604
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,320
Where is my son?

605
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,320
It's very far

606
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,320
I'm still a rabbit

607
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,320
I'm still a rabbit

608
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,320
Shit

609
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,320
Shit, I'm going to the bathroom

610
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,320
Let's put Chacha away first

611
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,320
We're going to pick up Keke

612
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,320
Shit

613
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,320
Wait a minute

614
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,320
Wait a minute

615
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,320
No

616
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,320
Fuck

617
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,320
I'm going to the bathroom

618
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,320
Wait a minute

619
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,320
Wait a minute

620
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,320
Wait a minute

621
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,320
Wait a minute

622
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,320
Wait a minute

623
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,320
Wait a minute

624
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,320
Fuck

625
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,320
Fuck

626
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,320
Fuck

627
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,320
Fuck

628
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,320
Fuck

629
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,320
Fuck

630
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,320
Fuck

631
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,320
Fuck

632
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,320
Fuck

633
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,320
Fuck

634
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,320
Fuck

635
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,320
Fuck

636
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,320
Fuck

637
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,320
Fuck

638
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,320
Fuck

639
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,320
Fuck

640
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,320
Hello

641
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,320
Hello

642
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,320
Sorry

643
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,320
Come here

644
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,320
Sorry

645
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,320
Sorry

646
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,320
The bus is not here

647
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,320
It's too much

648
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,320
Wait a minute

649
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,320
Wait a minute

650
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,320
I'll come straight over

651
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,320
Fuck

652
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,320
My voice is a little messy

653
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,320
Why don't you find a closer door to work?

654
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,320
It's easier to get away from home

655
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,320
Sorry

656
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,320
What do you want to discuss?

657
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,320
The place where the red line is drawn is not OK

658
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,320
This font is so comfortable

659
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,320
Is it 46?

660
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,320
26

661
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,320
26

662
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,320
No

663
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,320
I'm going to talk about it tonight

664
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,320
You change it with me now

665
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,320
Because you only sent it to me this morning

666
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,320
I wrote it while I was filling the stock

667
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,320
I'm quite attentive

668
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,320
The place where the dating experience is not spicy enough

669
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,320
No punch line

670
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,320
You said it yourself

671
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,320
I want to talk about dating

672
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,320
Because dating is the theme tonight

673
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,320
But are you dating?

674
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
You can only talk about what you know

675
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,320
Otherwise the audience will easily see you

676
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,320
Your logic is very strange

677
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,320
Did the R.D. really do those things

678
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,320
when he talked about the sexual harassment?

679
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,320
Don't give me such a sharp tongue

680
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,320
Okay, you can sort it out

681
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,320
I'll put the boss in the fourth position in order, okay?

682
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,320
I don't want to talk behind the R.D.

683
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,320
Why?

684
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,320
Are you afraid he'll laugh at you?

685
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,320
No, he never talks about it

686
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,320
I know

687
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,320
You should be happy

688
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,320
You check the Q

689
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,320
I'll go over

690
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,320
Okay

691
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,320
I don't think you have to talk so much

692
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,320
Did you help me?

693
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,320
Your clothes are very nice

694
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,320
I like the blue one

695
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,320
Thank you

696
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,320
I'm going to go to the bathroom

697
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,320
Thank you

698
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,320
Do you know what the captain is responsible for?

699
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,320
The crew?

700
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,320
Yes

701
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,320
What about the water gun?

702
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,320
The water gun is to turn off the lights

703
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,320
Turn off the lights?

704
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,320
You can't learn these things there

705
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,320
Really

706
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,320
It's so funny

707
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,320
Why did you ask me out today?

708
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,320
I...

709
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,320
You're shy

710
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,320
We've known each other for so long

711
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,320
No, I was thinking

712
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,320
What's more appropriate?

713
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,320
Let me tell you

714
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,320
One thing

715
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,320
Now

716
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,320
Two 80s

717
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,320
What's your problem today?

718
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,320
I...

719
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,320
I'll just say it

720
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,320
We're all so old

721
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,320
I...

722
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,320
What should I do?

723
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,320
Why do you think of me?

724
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,320
Actually

725
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,320
Lele always wanted to take care of me

726
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,320
She's afraid I'm old and no one cares about me

727
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,320
I'm afraid she'll take care of me

728
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,320
I've delayed the relationship between her and Kai

729
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,320
If I find a partner now

730
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,320
She won't have to take care of me

731
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,320
Right?

732
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,320
Chen Guangqi

733
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,320
I'm not wrong

734
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,320
You want to find a partner

735
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,320
Or a caretaker?

736
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,320
I didn't mean that

737
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,320
I mean we're old

738
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,320
We should take care of each other

739
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,320
Who's older than you?

740
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,320
Are you angry?

741
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,320
Next

742
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,320
I want to introduce this person

743
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,320
She's the only female performer

744
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,320
In our funny drama

745
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,320
She's also the only one

746
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,320
Who got married and divorced

747
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,320
Welcome Chen Lele

748
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,320
How are you all doing?

749
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,320
I'm Lele

750
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,320
Today's topic is dating

751
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,320
I can only say

752
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,320
Dating

753
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,320
I haven't dated for a long time

754
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,320
Seriously

755
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,320
Don't you think dating

756
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,320
Is too much of a formality?

757
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,320
Especially for girls

758
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,320
You have to get up early

759
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,320
Take a shower

760
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,320
And put on a good make-up

761
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,320
Find the most decent outfit for you

762
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,320
And in the process

763
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,320
Pretend you're a person who never gives a shit

764
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,320
And also

765
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,320
Do love

766
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
What is love?

767
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,320
I don't know

768
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,320
Same word?

769
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,320
Dating?

770
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,320
I don't understand

771
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,320
What is love?

772
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,320
This topic has reached my age

773
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,320
I'm not interested at all

774
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,320
You know?

775
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,320
I'm already 40

776
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,320
We only talk about

777
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,320
I want to ask you

778
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,320
When was the first time you did love?

779
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,320
On the stage

780
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,320
Are there any 40-year-old audience?

781
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,320
OK, I'm not going to lie

782
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,320
This is the reaction we should have at our age

783
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,320
I

784
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,320
I'm old

785
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,320
Seriously

786
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,320
What dating?

787
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,320
Don't say you have the courage to love someone

788
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,320
I don't even have the courage to get up

789
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,320
I can't do it

790
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,320
I'm stuck

791
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,320
I can't lie down anymore

792
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,320
I'll have time to lie down after I die

793
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,320
There's not much time anyway

794
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,320
Really

795
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,320
I'm old

796
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,320
This afternoon

797
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,320
I have a middle-aged woman in my shop

798
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,320
I always thought I had a lot of time when I was young

799
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,320
I wanted to grow up soon

800
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,320
But I don't know when I suddenly felt

801
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,320
Time seems to be not enough

802
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,320
Jiayun said since she had a child

803
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,320
Time seems to be not enough

804
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,320
I'll help her with the medical examination first

805
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,320
Her kidney is not well

806
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,320
I'll treat her first

807
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,320
Su Fei said

808
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,320
Since her cat was born at the age of six

809
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,320
Time seems to be not enough

810
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,320
What about me?

811
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,320
I never thought my father would get old

812
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,320
But that day

813
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,320
I saw his back

814
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,320
I forgot

815
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,320
People

816
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,320
Are all aging in an instant

817
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,320
Dad

818
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,320
I tell you

819
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,320
Why do you keep looking at me

820
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,320
Why do you keep looking at me

821
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,320
Smile

822
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,320
I'm already smiling

823
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,320
What does it look like if you don't smile

824
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,320
You won't want to see it

825
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,320
I was just a suggestion

826
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,320
A non-sensual suggestion

827
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,320
I'm sorry

828
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,320
I'm sorry

829
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,320
I'm sorry

830
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,320
I'm sorry

I'm sorry

I'm sorry

834
