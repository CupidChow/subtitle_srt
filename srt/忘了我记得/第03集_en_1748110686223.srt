1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What did you think?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Are you a woman?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yes

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm a man

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
But I'm not a woman

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm a man

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm a man

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You can't call me that

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You can't call me that

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm a man

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm a man

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm a man

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm a man

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm a man

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I was like, can I be a little fatter?

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I was like...

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A little fatter?

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Okay

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh, I'm in the wrong place

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Okay

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So, I really want to ask

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Does this count as a double-double?

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It does

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Okay, this gentleman

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm curious, is this person next to you a friend or girlfriend?

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Girlfriend

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Girlfriend

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Wedding date

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I think we need to understand

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Why two people have double standards for each other

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Congratulations

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I want to tell everyone

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I want to encourage the audience

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Including you

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
To be in a relationship

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If you are in a relationship

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Don't let go easily

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Really

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Because you may be in a relationship

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You have been too long

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Too long

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So long that you have forgotten how ugly you look now

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Do you know?

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
If you forget how to judge your beauty

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Or the state you are in now

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I will teach you a method

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If you see a person on the road

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And that person is yourself

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Then you ask yourself

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Would I want to date this person?

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Wow

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So sad and silent

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I have to say that letting go is harder than I thought

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If you have to find another person

55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The one who is willing to hold your hand

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's harder

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Especially at my middle age

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I don't know why every time I see someone getting married

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I have some feelings

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Then I will write those feelings

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
In the wedding card to be sent out

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I will write

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The future

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It can't be sweet forever

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So when you want to grab her face

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Please think about it

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I will think about it

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
When you want to grab her face

69
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Please think about it

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The reason you fell in love with her

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I want to go to Singapore

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Today is decided

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
They want me to manage your office

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Can we

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Try again?

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Bye bye

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Bye bye

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Lele

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Are you interested in coming back to talk show?

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Sorry, are you serious?

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You have potential

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Are you following me?

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
No, don't misunderstand

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I am the audience

86
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I just want to say

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Thank you tonight

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Thank you for what?

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Thank you for making me

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
More happy

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
More happy

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You are welcome

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Hello

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Do you have any more play?

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
No

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay, thank you

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Thank you

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Now is the time

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I will wait

102
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Thank you

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000

105
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Thank you

109
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000

00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You are not yet accurate

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000

So happy

129
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh my god

130
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Oh my god

131
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Let me see

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So happy

135
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000

Cheers

140
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Cheers

141
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's all watermelon flavor

142
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Let's welcome Chen Lele

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Chen Lele

144
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Chen Lele

145
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So hot

146
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So scared

147
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So scared

148
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So sweet

149
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes

150
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So sweet

151
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
In those

152
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Seems to be relaxed daily life

153
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
When did we start to forget

154
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The reason for chasing each other

155
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So happy

156
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Thank you

157
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I am Chen Lele

158
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I know

159
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I will be at my dad's house

160
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I will be there on time

161
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The restaurant looks really expensive

162
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The pressure is too big

163
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Without money

164
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's just that your house

165
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You are here

166
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The show is all in a hurry

167
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Can't come

168
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
How long have you been here

169
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I have been here for half a year

170
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
For a lifetime

171
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yes, my dad is back

172
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You came just right

173
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Take a picture with me

174
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Wait a minute

175
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
My dad is back

176
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Low angle

177
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Low

178
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Lower

179
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Wait a minute

180
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
All in

181
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes

182
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Right

183
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Okay

184
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Right

185
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Okay

186
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Thank you

187
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I received your address

188
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Not bad

189
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Okay

190
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Bye

191
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll buy you something

192
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
In the kitchen

193
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I don't need anything

194
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Just need you to accompany me

195
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You are busy too

196
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
How about it

197
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Now the mahjong doesn't fight

198
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
That Mrs. Li

199
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The knuckles are too long

200
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The fingers are deformed

201
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Can't wear the ring

202
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
She said it's not good to play cards like this

203
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Then you find

204
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You find a new card

205
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
We are old

206
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm used to playing with the old

207
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Come a new one

208
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I have to get used to it again

209
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Forget it

210
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Come on

211
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Hurry up

212
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Hurry up

213
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Hurry up

214
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Hurry up

215
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Hurry up

216
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
This big thing

217
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Wait a minute

218
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Don't touch

219
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Hurry up

220
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Hurry up

221
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
This game is really a long time

222
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Okay, now it's finally water to the city

223
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You know

224
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
How long did this guy count on you

225
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So you can become a close partner

226
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Wait a minute

227
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Please prove it

228
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
What is算計

229
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You have to have a comment

230
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I think

231
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
My junior has studied abroad

232
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Then know how to deal with foreigners

233
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So Zhang Kai promised

234
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What did you promise

235
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The main thing today is to celebrate

236
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Our Singapore branch is open

237
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yes

238
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Then I want to invite my junior today

239
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Are you interested in going abroad

240
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I understand what the senior means

241
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
For overseas expansion

242
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I am interested

243
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Then it's done

244
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Interested

245
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Then it's done

246
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
No no no

247
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What are you talking about

248
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Golden ball

249
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Thank you senior

250
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Thank you

251
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Thank you

252
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Okay, don't mind them

253
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Legal men

254
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Just talk about work

255
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
it is good

256
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
But

257
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Wait a minute

258
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
But

259
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The most important but came out

260
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But

261
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
But I just came back to Taiwan

262
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Then I want to spend more time with me

263
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
With my wife and my father-in-law

264
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But senior, I will

265
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Take a good care of it

266
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Thank you senior

267
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Will your wife come

268
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Correct

269
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I said I would come several times before

270
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Didn't appear

271
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Correct

272
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Is he working

273
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yes

274
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
He is busy recently

275
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Your Internet pot

276
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm sorry

277
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'll wash it again

278
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
No need

279
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The water in the water tank is clean

280
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
No need to eat

281
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
No problem

282
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm looking for time

283
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Let people look at the keys again

284
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Don't worry about me

285
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I can do it myself

286
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
By the way

287
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Next weekend

288
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm going to go to the Dandan Valley with your uncle

289
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Two days of recording

290
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Two days

291
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What age recording

292
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Younger than you

293
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
By the way

294
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
After eating

295
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You take a few packs of noodles back to Zhang Kai

296
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
He said he liked it very much last time

297
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
He is talking to you

298
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What son-in-law

299
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
See the donkey

300
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Oh my god

301
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Oh my god

302
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What's wrong

303
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh my god

304
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What's the matter

305
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I think Zhang Kai has a very important party tonight

306
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I forgot

307
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I forgot

308
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Take it after eating

309
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
No no no

310
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Be careful

311
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I will call me

312
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Come with me

313
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I have to go

314
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I have to go

315
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I play crazy all day

316
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Can't stand it

317
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Sorry Kai

318
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm on the way now

319
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Almost there

320
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Wait for me

321
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Jason, what are you doing

322
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's not coming after dragging for so long

323
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
This is a private conversation

324
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Do you think Jason is one or zero

325
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You are very boring

326
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Wait a minute

327
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Let me tell you

328
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Our office is very open

329
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
As long as the ability is OK

330
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Nothing else

331
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Because I think

332
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm quite humorous

333
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
But sometimes I can't get his jokes

334
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Really?

335
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Can't get

336
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Come

337
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Let me introduce to you

338
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
This is my partner

339
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Roger

340
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Hello

341
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Come

342
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Sit down

343
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Let's introduce

344
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Just let me go

345
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Hello

346
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Hello

347
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
This is my in-law

348
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yes, I am his in-law

349
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I am Amy

350
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Hello

351
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Hello

352
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I

353
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Is your wife here?

354
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yes

355
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Hello

356
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
There are many cars outside

357
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Sorry for being late

358
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Your wife is not here

359
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Do you think it's a joke?

360
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Is it a joke to run to the school?

361
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I am

362
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Excuse me, sir

363
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Can you help me change it?

364
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Are you sure I'm older than you?

365
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Excuse me, sir

366
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Can you help me change it?

367
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I really have

368
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm in a hurry

369
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm sorry

370
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm in a hurry

371
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Okay, I'm going in

372
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I really envy the life of my sister

373
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
She has artistic spirit

374
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm interested in it

375
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's fun

376
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
If you're envious

377
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I was the only one who didn't come last time

378
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
She doesn't have time

379
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What kind of life is it now?

380
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Write a report every day

381
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Write it in the middle of the night

382
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Are you a new assistant professor?

383
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yes, I am a deputy professor

384
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I really became a student soldier

385
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Please

386
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Everyone is so hard

387
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm the only one who wants to retire soon

388
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You've earned enough

389
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You can retire quickly

390
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You can rely on you

391
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Her name is

392
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Roger

393
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Roger

394
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Roger, what do you do?

395
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Wait, let me try it

396
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
She looks very tasteful when she wears clothes

397
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It should be related to art

398
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
She just started to get in touch with stage plays

399
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
She is really into art

400
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
So strange

401
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Stage play

402
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Last time I had a classmate

403
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Asked me to sponsor a stage play

404
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I asked around

405
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I heard that stage plays now

406
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Make a lot of money

407
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But no one watches

408
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What do you know?

409
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You're the only one who doesn't watch

410
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Actors' work is actually very hard

411
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
They have to burn the money on the stage

412
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And many people's income is unstable

413
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
No, your friends don't understand

414
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
They are outsiders

415
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Actually they may think

416
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's easy for actors to talk on stage

417
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It's actually called training, right?

418
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Not easy

419
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Not easy

420
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Thank you

421
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Not easy

422
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Wait, wait

423
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
How is Singapore?

424
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I will consider

425
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Sorry

426
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Come

427
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Sorry

428
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Sorry

429
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Sorry to keep you waiting

430
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
My wife is here

431
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Welcome

432
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Welcome

433
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Look

434
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'll sit here

435
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Wait

436
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Honey, are you too rushed?

437
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I think she is too rushed

438
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
So

439
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Do you want to sort it out?

440
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
No, it's okay

441
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Sorry

442
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Sorry

443
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm sorry

444
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
First time meeting

445
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Okay

446
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Take your time

447
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
She just came and she is leaving

448
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Are you okay?

449
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Do you want to take care of her?

450
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's okay

451
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's okay

452
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Enough

453
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Come

454
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm also having breakfast

455
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Thank you

456
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Never mind

457
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I have something better

458
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
See you

459
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
See you

460
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Okay

461
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Okay

462
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Okay

463
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I have to go

464
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Our usual wait

465
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I have a very pinny National Monument

466
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Am I です

467
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,800
Sorry

468
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Okay

469
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Goodbye

470
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
How are you doing?

471
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Have you been well?

472
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I've been fine

473
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Really?

474
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I see

475
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Don't worry

476
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Bye

477
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
See you

478
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You're tired after working so late.

479
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You must be very hungry.

480
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Hurry up and eat.

481
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Okay, thank you.

482
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Wait.

483
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Before we eat, we need to celebrate.

484
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Today is the first time we all gathered together.

485
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
We're late.

486
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Let's have a toast.

487
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Let's have a toast first.

488
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
No problem.

489
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Sorry.

490
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Let's drink together.

491
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'll pay.

492
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Sorry.

493
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
We were just talking about you.

494
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Really?

495
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
We're really curious about you.

496
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What kind of job are you doing?

497
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You work so late.

498
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
No, I like to work during the day.

499
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
He's working at a bank.

500
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Bank?

501
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Really?

502
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Yes.

503
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
He just became the director recently.

504
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
So he's a bit busier.

505
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Thank you.

506
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Thank you.

507
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You can ask him about any financial issues in the future.

508
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
That's great.

509
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You're amazing.

510
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I've always been different about numbers.

511
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'll ask Le Le more questions if I have any problems.

512
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
By the way, we have a reading meeting.

513
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
How about we meet up?

514
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
We can share some financial information with the ladies.

515
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Okay.

516
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
What kind of reading is it?

517
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
We usually read about our children,

518
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
cooking, and spiritual growth.

519
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Sometimes, we'll have art.

520
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Let's all come together next time.

521
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
How about this?

522
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Let's toast to everyone.

523
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Let's make the overseas version of the painting

524
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
more famous.

525
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Let's toast to everyone.

526
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
The overseas version of the painting can be more famous.

527
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm relieved to hear you say that.

528
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Let's toast.

529
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
To us, overseas...

530
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
To us, overseas...

531
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I broke the pipe in the kitchen.

532
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Is it fixed?

533
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yes.

534
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
They said they'd send me to...

535
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You think I'm embarrassing you?

536
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm sorry.

537
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Are you going to stop now?

538
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Do you think you'll be okay every time you don't talk?

539
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I think you're in a bad mood now.

540
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I can't discuss things with you.

541
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So you chose not to talk?

542
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
My dad said he and my mom have never had a fight in our lives.

543
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's fine if we don't argue or communicate.

544
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But what happened?

545
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
We're in a different situation from your parents.

546
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
No.

547
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
We're exactly the same.

548
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I remember this expression of yours.

549
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Why can you always escape so calmly?

550
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Why do you always need to be so educated?

551
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Do you know silence is the most perfect way to express your feelings?

552
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Is this thing that serious?

553
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You don't recognize my job?

554
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I don't not recognize your job.

555
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
But have you ever cared about how I feel?

556
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Have you put me in the top priority?

557
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I told you about something so important today.

558
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
But you still forgot.

559
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I told you.

560
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
My dad's kitchen is ruined.

561
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Don't take your dad as an excuse.

562
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You know how much you care about your dad.

563
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
To be honest,

564
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I eat more than you do.

565
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You're just like your dad.

566
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You're just yourself.

567
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Living in your own world.

568
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm sorry.

569
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I was talking...

570
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
No, no.

571
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It's my fault.

572
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Sorry.

573
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It's my fault.

574
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I shouldn't have been late.

575
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
But this doesn't mean

576
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
you can humiliate me in front of everyone.

577
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Why would I humiliate you?

578
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Why would I humiliate you?

579
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
If my job

580
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
is not enough to make Ge

581
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
a wife to me,

582
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
then we have nothing to say.

583
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Don't be like this, okay?

584
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Just think about it.

585
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
You're not in the same social circle.

586
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I forgot.

587
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I was bullied tonight.

588
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I was bullied.

589
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I was bullied.

590
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I was invited to their reading party tonight.

591
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
What?

592
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Do you want to pee?

593
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I want to pee, too.

594
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
You go first.

595
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
You go first.

596
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
You...

597
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Let's go together.

598
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Okay.

599
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It's okay.

600
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I'll go first.

601
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Honestly,

602
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
we've discussed it many times.

603
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I can afford to support you now.

604
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
You can change to a relatively

605
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
easy job.

606
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
What kind of job is easy?

607
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Staying at home without working is the easiest.

608
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I didn't ask you to quit your job.

609
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You go to the hospital to work during the day.

610
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You tell jokes at night.

611
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Did I say anything?

612
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I come back from work every night.

613
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I can't see anyone.

614
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I also hope that

615
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
we have our own little days.

616
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
At the same time, I also hope

617
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
you can slowly

618
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
integrate into my life.

619
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Do you understand?

620
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I know.

621
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
But

622
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I'm just not used to

623
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
that kind of occasion, that kind of social circle.

624
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Are you okay?

625
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
You don't need to be so hostile.

626
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I'm not.

627
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
You're not?

628
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Are you sure?

629
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
You really have a good eye

630
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
to see me

631
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
and my colleagues from the office.

632
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Even if they are good friends,

633
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
you still think they have a purpose.

634
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
They don't?

635
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Why do they have to?

636
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
They just want to know

637
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
what my wife looks like.

638
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
They want to see and understand you more.

639
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
That's all.

640
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I really doubt that

641
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
they want to understand me more.

642
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I'm not.

643
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Didn't your dad always tell you

644
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
to face everyone

645
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
with a relaxed attitude.

646
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
No matter if that person is better

647
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
or better than you,

648
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
you don't need to please or flatter them.

649
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
So I'm not trying to please them.

650
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Then you don't need to be a thorn in their side.

651
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Why do you have to choose

652
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
such a fancy restaurant?

653
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
They want to celebrate.

654
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Of course you have to choose a restaurant.

655
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Did you hear that?

656
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
They were chatting

657
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
and talking about something all night.

658
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
That's how their lives are.

659
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
So you can't be sure of anything.

660
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Calm down. Listen to me.

661
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Look at my face.

662
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You're my wife.

663
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
You're a very important part of my life.

664
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I just want you to

665
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
get to know them

666
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
and understand them.

667
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
That's all.

668
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Is it hard?

669
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
But am I...

670
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Am I also

671
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
a part of your life

672
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
that you want to be?

673
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So you're back to normal now?

674
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You know, I really...

675
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I really don't understand you.

676
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
You were so happy

677
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
and humorous on stage.

678
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
You're so good at joking.

679
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
So you think I'm a

680
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
boring person

681
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
in private?

682
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I don't think so.

683
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I just hope you don't take

684
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
this matter so seriously.

685
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So you don't think

686
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
what you did today is not okay?

687
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I think I'm not okay.

688
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I want to apologize to you.

689
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Are you serious?

690
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Are you serious?

691
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
What do you want me to do

692
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
to make you think

693
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I'm serious?

694
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
What do you want me to do?

695
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
What do you want me to do?

696
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I don't know.

697
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I don't know.

698
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I...

699
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I really want to believe that...

700
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I work very hard every day.

701
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I work very hard,

702
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
but I'm also very anxious.

703
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Not everyone

704
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
is like you.

705
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Your family is rich

706
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
and you can send me to school.

707
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Your parents

708
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
can be old and happy now.

709
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And you can be free and free every day.

710
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
What's the biggest

711
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
mistake in your life?

712
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
It's probably that time

713
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
when you thought

714
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
you were a partner.

715
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You failed.

716
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
What's wrong with you?

717
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Are you belittling

718
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
my effort?

719
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Is this how my family is?

720
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Am I wrong?

721
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
That's not what I meant.

722
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
You're not.

723
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I was born in a poor family.

724
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I'm a good teacher.

725
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Am I wrong?

726
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Or is it my parents' fault?

727
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Do I live a hard life?

728
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Even if I work twice or three times

729
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
more than others,

730
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
they don't even recognize me.

731
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Do you know that

732
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I'm a partner today?

733
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Everyone thinks

734
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I'm relying on my family,

735
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
my dad, and my mom.

736
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
That's not what I meant.

737
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Then what do you mean?

738
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I can tell you today

739
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
that I'm working harder than anyone else.

740
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I'm working harder

741
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
than anyone else in this world.

742
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I said I didn't mean that.

743
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
But everyone has their own hardships.

744
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Then what do you mean?

745
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
You said it.

746
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
But you're easier than anyone else.

747
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Do you always imagine

748
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
other people's lives

749
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
in your head?

750
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Can you try to think

751
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
about other people's lives

752
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
a little more seriously?

753
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Where are you going from now on?

754
00:29:40,000 --> 00:30:00,400
I'm going to contact

755
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,880
careful concern to it.

756
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,280
But what about your harvesting skills?

757
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,440
Can you tell me...

758
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,800
This job...

759
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,480
What did they do wrong to annoy you?

760
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,320
They didn't bother me or annoy me at all

761
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,040
But I want to know...

762
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,040
I'm the only one in this world who feels helpless in life.

763
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,040
I stand on stage and talk about the problems I can't solve.

764
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,040
I laugh at those sad things.

765
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,040
And then those strangers laugh.

766
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,040
They understand.

767
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,040
Do you understand?

768
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,040
I understand.

769
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,040
Can you just...

770
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,040
Can you just...

771
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,040
Can you just tell me honestly...

772
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:11,040
What kind of trouble did this job cause you?

773
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,040
Can you stop being a funny actor?

774
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:22,040
Can you stop being a funny actor?

775
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:36,040
Thank you for listening to me.

776
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,040
Where are you going?

777
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,040
Do you want me to tell you the truth?

778
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,040
You're leaving again.

779
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:48,040
I'm afraid I'll say something that will make us both regret it.

780
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,040
Le Le. Le Le.

781
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,040
I didn't mean that.

782
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,040
I didn't mean that either.

783
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,040
Honestly, why did you want to marry me?

784
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,040
Do you want to say it?

785
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,040
Because I...

786
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,040
I'm happy when I see you.

787
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,040
I'm happy when I see you.

788
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,040
I'm happy when I see you.

789
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,040
I'm happy when I see you.

790
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,040
It's going to rain.

791
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,040
Come down.

792
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,040
What's wrong with your foot?

793
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,040
Do you need a doctor?

794
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,040
No.

795
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,040
Here, I'll give you this.

796
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,040
Here, I'll give you this.

797
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,040
I'm sorry.

798
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,040
Le Le.

799
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,040
Le Le.

800
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,040
Le Le.

801
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,040
You're a hanger.

802
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,040
Let me through.

803
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,040
Le Le.

804
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,040
You feel very embarrassed.

805
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,040
You're embarrassed for saying that out loud.

806
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,040
You...

807
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:37,040
I'm embarrassed for saying that out loud.

808
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,040
I...

809
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,640
How do you like it?

810
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,800
I can't feel something Special.

811
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,620
What has happened?

812
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,580
Don't worry

813
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,560
But I have something to tell you

814
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,400
Forget it

815
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,560
You know

816
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:55,880
Just hateuga

817
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:00,720
Go

818
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:03,760
The pink is bad

819
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,740
Why is it not a pink?

820
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,540
Is it auxiliary?

821
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,420
Bye

822
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,600
Antigen

823
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,700
Second

824
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,260
Third

825
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,400
Four

826
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,400
five

827
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,040
Look

828
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,000
So cool

829
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,700
Second

830
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,420
Well

831
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,680
D入

832
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,300
patt considering

833
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:16,980
I

834
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,560
So

835
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,300
The pink

836
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:24,300
Everyone, let's welcome Chen Le Le!

837
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,300
Hello everyone, how are you? I'm Le Le.

838
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,300
I took a break for two weeks.

839
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,300
These two weeks are really important to me.

840
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:42,300
Because I need to think about whether I should get divorced or not.

841
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,300
I know, some of you must be thinking,

842
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,300
you need to think about the divorce for two weeks?

843
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,300
Okay, here's the thing.

844
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,300
I wanted to get divorced because two weeks ago,

845
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:01,300
I went to a very important dinner party at my husband's Lawyer's Office.

846
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:05,300
It was the one that celebrated the establishment of overseas branch companies.

847
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:09,300
They were meeting at a very high-end French restaurant.

848
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,300
The partner saw me and asked,

849
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,300
what does your wife do?

850
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,300
Let me add something.

851
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,300
I worked at a convenience store during the day,

852
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,300
and performed here at night.

853
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:26,300
My husband, a handsome and talented lawyer,

854
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,300
and a law firm partner,

855
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,300
stopped to think about it.

856
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,300
I was thinking, what would he say?

857
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,300
Would he say, I'm a convenience store employee,

858
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,300
or a talk show actor?

859
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,300
And in the middle of these two answers,

860
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:46,300
he finally decided to choose the bank's high-end manager.

861
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:51,300
Wow, that was really complicated for me.

862
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:55,300
You always didn't like my job.

863
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,300
You were so embarrassed to say it.

864
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,300
On the other hand, I thought,

865
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:04,300
the bank's high-end manager and the law firm partner

866
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,300
sounded like they were in the same team.

867
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,300
But I had limited knowledge.

868
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,300
I thought the bank's high-end manager

869
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,300
was very sensitive to numbers.

870
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,300
So that night, I was in all the conversations,

871
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,300
and added all kinds of numbers.

872
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,300
Did you know that last year,

873
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,300
there were 114,606 couples in Taiwan

874
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,300
who got married in the 4.88% interest rate.

875
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,300
But there were 47,887 couples who got divorced.

876
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,300
But it didn't work.

877
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:39,300
The divorce rate was 9.32%.

878
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,300
That's it!

879
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,300
I just pretended.

880
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,300
I pretended to be the last one.

881
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,300
I was about to succeed, but I failed.

882
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,300
Because when the dinner was over,

883
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,300
the ladies were waving their hands and saying goodbye.

884
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,300
Bye-bye, see you.

885
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,300
It was a very international farewell.

886
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,300
I said,

887
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,300
thank you for coming.

888
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,300
Please enjoy.

889
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,300
But you know what?

890
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,300
What made me the most angry was

891
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,300
that there were a couple in the partner group

892
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,300
who said,

893
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,300
Comrade Nan, you're so cool.

894
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,300
They didn't need to hide their identities.

895
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,300
So, can anyone tell me

896
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,300
that it's harder to be a comedy actor

897
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,300
than Comrade Nan?

898
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,300
But I think comedy actors are actually

899
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,300
a very noble profession.

900
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,300
Because they are very similar to lawyers.

901
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,300
We put our happiness

902
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,300
on the pain of others.

903
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:46,300
So, being a lawyer is amazing.

904
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,300
Okay, I admit it's amazing.

905
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,300
Because now, after I thought about the divorce,

906
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,300
I realized that if you're a lawyer,

907
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:58,300
you can help yourself to save a lawyer's fee.

908
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,300
Isn't that important?

909
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,300
So, I have to say,

910
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,300
my husband...

911
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,300
I remember when we were getting married,

912
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,300
I asked my husband

913
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,300
why he wanted to marry me.

914
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:34,300
He said he was happy to see me.

915
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,300
But now,

916
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,300
why can't he be happy to see me?

917
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,300
What's wrong with me?

918
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,300
Whether it's a smooth or a tough life,

919
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,300
rich or poor,

920
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,300
healthy or ill...

921
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,300
I'm sorry, I have to go.

922
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,300
We will be loyal to each other.

923
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,300
We will love each other

924
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,300
until the end of time.

925
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,300
When we were talking about this,

926
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:10,300
we didn't lie, did we?

927
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,300
No, right?

928
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,300
I remember every moment of the wedding.

929
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,300
We used to love each other so much.

930
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,300
But...

931
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,300
Why can't we love each other now?

932
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,300
Okay.

933
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,300
I am going to Singapore.

934
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,300
Alright.

935
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,060
Don't be angry.

936
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:01,980
Tell me,

937
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,140
do you stillの right to reserve a room for all of us?

938
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,820
I'll be working for the department now,

939
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,820
We've been working too hard.

940
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:41,820
Zhang Kai fell in love with me on the lowest day of his life.

941
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:46,820
But he decided to leave me on the highest day of his life.

942
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,820
Maybe we're not not in love anymore.

943
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,820
We've been working too hard.

944
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,820
Zhang Kai

945
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:03,820
Do you want us to be together and scold Zhang Kai?

946
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,820
Or do you want to go on the road that says,

947
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,820
I don't allow you to say that?

948
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,820
I respect his decision.

949
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,820
It's too official.

950
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,820
I mean it.

951
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:17,820
Why don't you move back to your dad's house?

952
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:21,820
I don't want to move back to that old house that looks like a ghost.

953
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:25,820
This bag is for you.

954
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,820
I forgot how nice it is to live alone.

955
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,820
You can go home and cook.

956
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:30,820
You won't feel guilty.

957
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:33,820
You can also carry a weight loss band at home.

958
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,820
Weight loss band?

959
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,820
Okay.

960
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,820
You have to become beautiful.

961
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,820
Everyone will come back.

962
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:42,820
Living alone is great.

963
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,820
You just have to take care of yourself.

964
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,820
At this age, everything has been filled with possibilities.

965
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:51,820
How about we live together after 30 years?

966
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:53,820
I went to see a community development.

967
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,820
That house is so beautiful.

968
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,820
It's perfect for the life of an old man.

969
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:58,820
Wait a minute, old man.

970
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,820
Are you serious?

971
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,820
Is this the topic of our dreams now?

972
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,820
You're exaggerating.

973
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:05,820
You're here.

974
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:06,820
Dad.

975
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,820
Kaihan.

976
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:10,820
You guys.

977
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,820
We're here to help.

978
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:16,820
Thank you.

979
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:18,820
You guys.

980
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,820
A-mei.

981
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,820
You can't.

982
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,820
You can just come home and live here.

983
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,820
I'll take care of you.

984
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:37,820
That's right.

985
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:41,820
How could Mr. Cheng say such a warm word?

986
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:45,820
Thank you.

987
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:47,820
You guys.

988
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,820
A-mei.

989
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,820
It's a waste of money.

990
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,820
You can just come home and live here.

991
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:57,820
Why do you rent a small room that's only ten minutes away from home?

992
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,820
I want to start over.

993
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,820
And if I really live there,

994
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:02,820
I'll start to clean up.

995
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:03,820
You'll regret it.

996
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,820
You put this down.

997
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,820
If you can't put it down, you put it there first.

998
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:08,820
No, no, no.

999
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:09,820
Don't move the garbage home.

1000
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,820
You also piled up a pile of garbage at home.

1001
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,820
You put it there first.

1002
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:14,820
I'll clean up the garbage.

1003
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:15,820
I'll go to the bathroom.

1004
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:16,820
Okay.

1005
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:17,820
Okay.

1006
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:18,820
I'm going to get something.

1007
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:19,820
What?

1008
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:20,820
Thank you.

1009
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:21,820
Sure.

1010
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:22,820
Leave it to us.

1011
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:23,820
I also want something.

1012
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:24,820
I'll get it for you.

1013
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:25,820
Okay?

1014
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:26,820
Hello, Mr. Cheng.

1015
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:27,820
Hello.

1016
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:28,820
This way, please.

1017
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:29,820
Thank you.

1018
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:33,820
What's going on between you and Zhang Kai?

1019
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:34,820
Please.

1020
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:35,820
I ran away from the scene.

1021
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,820
I just don't want to talk about Zhang Kai and me.

1022
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,820
It's a blessing to see you guys.

1023
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:46,820
I heard a joke a few days ago.

1024
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:49,820
The elder asked the child,

1025
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:52,820
you won't get married or have children in the future.

1026
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:55,820
When the family lights up during the New Year,

1027
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,820
you'll know how lonely you are.

1028
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,820
The daughter said,

1029
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:01,820
I just don't get married.

1030
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,820
I don't pay the electricity bill.

1031
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:07,820
It's cold.

1032
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:08,820
It's cold.

1033
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,820
It's cold.

1034
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:15,820
According to my experience,

1035
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:17,820
I want to give you some advice on marriage.

1036
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:21,820
You're the most unfit for marriage in Taipei, aren't you?

1037
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,820
Listen to me.

1038
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,820
It's the heaven and earth that makes people happy when they're together.

1039
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:27,820
When they're not together,

1040
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:30,820
it's the heaven that makes the earth unhappy.

1041
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:31,820
Okay.

1042
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:32,820
Okay.

1043
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:36,820
You should tell this to the aliens.

1044
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:40,820
Aliens are willing to visit the earth

1045
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,820
and look at the earth.

1046
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:45,820
Don't you think they're very intelligent?

1047
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,820
It's incredible.

1048
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,820
I didn't expect that on the first day I moved in,

1049
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:53,820
I was talking to my dad about aliens.

1050
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,820
Don't you have something to take me back?

1051
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,820
Here.

1052
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,820
In the kitchen.

1053
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,820
Okay.

1054
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,820
Where do you think I should go?

1055
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:15,820
Go home.

1056
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:18,820
Su Fei and Jiayun are waiting for me there.

1057
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,820
You go home. I go home.

1058
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,820
My home is your home.

1059
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,820
Okay.

1060
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:43,820
Su Fei.

1061
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,820
Su Fei.

1062
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,820
Su Fei.

1063
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:49,820
Su Fei.

1064
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:51,820
Su Fei.

1065
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,820
Su Fei.

1066
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,820
Su Fei.

1067
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:57,820
Su Fei.

1068
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:59,820
Su Fei.

1069
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,820

1070
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:03,820

Su Fei.

1077
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:17,820
Su Fei.

1078
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,820
Su Fei.

1079
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,820

1080
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,820

1085
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:33,820
