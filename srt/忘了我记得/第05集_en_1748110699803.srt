00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The End

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Episode 1

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Life is a series of choices

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And I choose what I can bear

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Here, take this

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Thank you

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hello, miss, do you need an in-or-out-of-the-box?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Is it a delivery man?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The delivery man wants to buy clothes and give them to you today

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What would you like to drink today?

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'll have a cup of latte

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Okay, latte

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Do you need a five-person drink?

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Or a small bottle of fresh milk?

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Or a low-fat coffee?

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Or a full-fat coffee?

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Or a sugar?

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
A large cup? A medium cup? Or a small cup?

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What time do you need it?

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Is the ice cream still hot?

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Or do you want it in the cup or the outside?

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Outside

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Outside

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Low-fat coffee

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Low-fat coffee

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Sorry, we have to wait a little bit

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Thank you

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'll think about it

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No problem

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Hello, miss, do you need an in-or-out-of-box?

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Or do you need an in-or-out-of-box?

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Is it a delivery man?

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I need an in-or-out-of-box

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I need to go to the store

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'll have a special order

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
A large cup of latte, a cup of coffee, a cup of sugar

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And I want a fat coffee

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And a three-inch coffee with a special pulse

39
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'll need a card

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And a bag, thank you

41
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Thank you

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's just a cup of coffee

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But every time I'm asked, my IQ drops to the standard

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm coming

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Can't I come back two days earlier?

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Can't I come back two days earlier?

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You can choose the bread yourself

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I don't want you to make a choice between family and work

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But I haven't seen my parents in a long time

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Mom, I want this hot dog bread

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Okay, I won't talk about it

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That's not healthy

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That will cause a heart attack

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Didn't you ask me to choose it myself?

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Eat this, it's delicious and healthy

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'll be grateful when you grow up

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm leaving, it's late

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm leaving

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I believe many people know that I'm already in my forties

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I know what you're thinking

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I haven't stopped yet, okay?

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I haven't stopped yet

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But I can stop anytime

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm already in a time of chaos

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's like playing hide-and-seek with me

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Like, hey hey

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm coming, I'm leaving

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm coming, I'm leaving

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
When I was young, if I didn't come to the moon, I would be very nervous

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I would think to myself, I'm not pregnant, am I?

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But now, if I don't come to the moon, I'm still nervous

72
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I would think to myself, please, I'm pregnant

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I don't want to stop, I really don't want to

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It sounds so sad

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
When the tide falls, it will bring mental changes

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Memory loss

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You will always feel unhappy

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Or you can't concentrate

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And you're easily angry, you can't fall asleep

80
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
These symptoms, when I heard them, I thought

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
How could it be the same as my dad's Alzheimer's disease?

82
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So I told the doctor, wait

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Is it possible that you have a misdiagnosis?

84
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
My dad might not have Alzheimer's disease

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
He might just have a headache

86
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Stop, it's over

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Sir, please come in

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Sir, I'm sorry

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What's wrong?

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He said he lost something

91
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I just checked the front and back

92
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No one broke in

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I asked the old man what he lost, he didn't dare to say

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You said my wallet was lost

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You see, the key is still there

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Wallet?

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'll look for it

98
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Wallet

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm sorry

100
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm sorry

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm sorry

102
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm sorry

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This is my second visit this month

104
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'll come as long as you help us

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I know

106
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Would you like to take a break?

107
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Have a drink or something

108
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
No, it's okay

109
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'll leave first

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm sorry

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Sorry, it's been hard

112
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This hospital is cold

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
How is it?

114
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I just got a sprain in my back

115
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Sprain in your back?

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Wait, I'll find a seat for you

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Be careful

118
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm sorry

119
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Is there a chance...

120
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm pregnant

121
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Okay

122
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
No need

123
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Sit here

124
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
No need

125
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Thank you

126
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Go and sit

127
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay, Chen Bei Bei

128
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
How is your food these days?

129
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You don't have to be so loud

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
My ears are pretty good

131
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
How is your food these days?

132
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Who gave birth to you, Yue Han?

133
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Who?

134
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Hua

135
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Hwa Sen Jiong

136
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I had breakfast this morning

137
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Hwa Sen Jiong

138
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And toast

139
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You're so boring

140
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Focus

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
How was your sleep?

142
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Good

143
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Do you know what time it is this week?

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It doesn't matter

145
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Who is she?

146
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Do you know who came to see you today?

147
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
She's my daughter

148
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Doctor, I'm not sick

149
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
She's sick

150
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
She's not very good at remembering things

151
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
She always gets lost after school

152
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I always find her to come back

153
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
What about last night?

154
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Do you remember what you ate last night?

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Seaweed

156
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Seaweed

157
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Chen Bei Bei

158
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You're all fine

159
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You're fine

160
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yes, I'm not sick

161
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
She's sick

162
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
She should see a doctor

163
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yes

164
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I often look for her

165
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'll take a look for her

166
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You wait for us

167
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Okay

168
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
She's grown up

169
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Don't worry

170
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'll take you home

171
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Thank you

172
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm sorry

173
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
She's very weak now

174
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'll prescribe some delaying drugs

175
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But her memory will slowly dissipate

176
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And she'll start to suspect

177
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Because she forgot to put her things

178
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
She'll start to think if there's a thief

179
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Or even some violent phenomena

180
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But we still suggest that you accompany her

181
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And chat with her

182
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So that the situation will be better

183
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Is this situation irreversible?

184
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Just like we're getting older

185
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
We won't get younger

186
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Do you have any thoughts on the new drug I mentioned last time?

187
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yes, I did check the information

188
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But is there any side effect?

189
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
All drugs have side effects

190
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We just see that compared to the whole treatment

191
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What is the significant impact?

192
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
This is the only drug that can be treated for the kidney

193
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
We've been treating the kidney for a long time

194
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Our hospital has a new drug plan

195
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Chen Wei Bei is in her early stages

196
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Her treatment is the best

197
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I understand

198
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So I have to make a decision now?

199
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Because the cost...

200
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
If you go back and confirm with dad about the cost

201
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
We can still talk with the hospital

202
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Okay

203
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Why are you standing there?

204
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I don't need to stand there

205
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm giving it to someone else

206
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You're being too strong

207
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You're the one who's being too strong

208
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Have some coffee

209
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Let's find a place to drink

210
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Let me ask you

211
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Who do you think is better, coffee or coke?

212
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Coke

213
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Then who is the coffee-lover that coke is better with?

214
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Coke

215
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Coke

216
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Because she's in a good mood

217
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So she can live longer

218
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Coffee is hard to say

219
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It depends on everyone's life

220
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Whether there's any exercise

221
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The relationship with other people

222
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The environment in the world

223
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's all related

224
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And then?

225
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Nothing and then?

226
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Coffee has been talking for too long

227
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Coke is out of breath

228
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's so funny

229
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's not funny

230
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It looks very serious

231
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I lied to you

232
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Boring

233
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It still hurts a little

234
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Wait, be careful

235
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Thank you, thank you, thank you

236
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's okay

237
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I think we have to change to an elevator apartment

238
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's good to climb the stairs

239
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Can you exercise?

240
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What if I can't climb it one day?

241
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You look down on me too much

242
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
No, sooner or later

243
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I don't want to climb the stairs

244
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You're lazy

245
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm old

246
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm used to living here

247
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I don't want to move

248
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The doctor said you can't live alone

249
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Then you can live with the doctor

250
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
No, this can be discussed

251
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You go up and down

252
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's dangerous to go up and down the stairs

253
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm moving out when I'm old

254
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Then move to your heart

255
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You think the doctor's diagnosis is wrong

256
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You're not a wet tissue, you're a childish

257
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Hello

258
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Are you here to take over the shift?

259
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Are you kidding? You're so sudden

260
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I have to go to work today

261
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Is the job of a super businessman important?

262
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Just find someone to take over the shift

263
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'll think about it

264
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Where's the medicine?

265
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Wait a minute

266
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You go back quickly

267
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Do you want to play a birthday party today?

268
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's a good chance to shine

269
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I didn't do it

270
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And didn't you say that the jokes I said were not funny?

271
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Are you sure you want to discuss this now?

272
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Wow

273
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Or should I say you're a quiet businessman

274
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Is this more funny?

275
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Hello, welcome

276
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I want to take a break

277
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yes, I'm sorry

278
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You scared me

279
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's raining

280
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You're performing tonight?

281
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You're alone?

282
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Jack and my mother-in-law are in Taipei

283
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I can finally miss them

284
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I miss you

285
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
What happened?

286
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
What's wrong?

287
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What happened that I have to come to you?

288
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Friends are fake

289
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Let's go

290
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
When Jack went out just now, he told me

291
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
He said his colleague from the village

292
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
He wants to take the kids to the studio

293
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I said that Shao Shao is about to start

294
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's just a class

295
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
He said it doesn't matter

296
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It depends on what you want

297
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Do you want to ask for leave or what?

298
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What?

299
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It seems that I decided

300
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm actually being fooled

301
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You still want me to go to the toilet

302
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Take a leave, cancel the class, apologize to the teacher

303
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Do I have the right to choose?

304
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
At least you have an open choice

305
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I have to choose

306
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Those open options are fake

307
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
They are already choices after being chosen

308
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Is your dad okay?

309
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
How is he?

310
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I think my standards are changing every day

311
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
He used to help me make decisions

312
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Now I help him make decisions

313
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Moving house, new medicine

314
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
In the future, I have to help him decide

315
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Whether to eat or drink

316
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
How do I help him make decisions?

317
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Taking care of the elderly is like taking care of children

318
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You passed this class

319
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Not yet

320
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
The next class is coming soon

321
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
From milk powder, diapers to going to school, kindergarten

322
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Sometimes I feel like I'm crazy

323
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Why?

324
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I don't want to decide

325
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I want to sleep

326
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
If he is not satisfied, I will help him make a decision

327
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Will he say it himself if he is not satisfied?

328
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What if the decision that makes him not satisfied

329
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Actually is better for him

330
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Do you think it's better for him

331
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Or does he think it's better?

332
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I think it's better

333
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I have a good idea

334
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I have a good idea

335
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You have to...

336
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Old

337
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
No, small

338
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I will go to the bathroom

339
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Be careful

340
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Please drink

341
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Choose one

342
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Don't choose

343
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Where should I put these?

344
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
What will you choose?

345
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's so difficult

346
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
The convert has two flowers

347
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Take the pastgreen

348
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:23,820
Which flower is this in

349
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,820
What's the difference? It's romantic in the North.

350
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,520
Even if it's romantic, don't say it's a six-year-old, okay?

351
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,220
What about the group that's holding hands?

352
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,520
No, I'm alone.

353
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,420
I want to spend the New Year with Mimi.

354
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,020
Hello?

355
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,920
Manager.

356
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,720
Yes, this isn't a double-minded question.

357
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,720
I know my family is abroad, but...

358
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,120
Yes, Manager is the best for me.

359
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,920
I'm a pirate.

360
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,820
Thank you.

361
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,820
Thank you, Your Highness. Please enjoy the rest.

362
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,820
Thank you.

363
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,820
You're so annoying.

364
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:30,020
We listen to the radio in the rain

365
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:39,020
We chase the storm on the faces of life to come

366
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:46,020
We sit at the table at peace

367
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,020
We're sparring all the things

368
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,920
We're laying on the green meadows

369
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,920
Look upon the pressing moon

370
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,920
We hear the morning prayer

371
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,920
Chanting for the cure

372
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,920
We watch the stars with themselves

373
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:18,820
To miss our night

374
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,820
We meet by the counter

375
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,820
See you on the snowy fields

376
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:31,820
I see you in the forest

377
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,820
Under the twilight

378
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,820
That steals the colors from the sky

379
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:52,820
And all this wet confusion and desirability

380
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,820
How extraordinary

381
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,820
And ordinary

382
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,720
I'm just a little out of it

383
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,720
I'm just a little out of it

384
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:11,720
I'm just a little out of it

385
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,720
I'm just a little out of it

386
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,720
Dad, you put the key at the door. Do you know?

387
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,360
What's up?

388
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,720
Go in.

389
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,820
I'll be right there.

390
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,820
Hello, Le Le.

391
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,820
I want to ask you what happened to Uncle Yi.

392
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,820
What did he write about?

393
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,820
I can't leak the information of the client.

394
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,820
Can you be a little more flexible?

395
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,820
When did he come to talk to you about this?

396
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,820
Why don't I know? I'm his daughter.

397
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,820
It's such an important matter.

398
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,820
And then I don't know anything.

399
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,820
No one told me.

400
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,820
Are you...

401
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,820
okay?

402
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,820
I'm fine.

403
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,820
How could I be not okay?

404
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,820
I'm just single now.

405
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,820
I'm single and I have two jobs.

406
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,820
And then my dad thinks he's going to die.

407
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,820
I wrote a will.

408
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,820
I have a will to take.

409
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,820
How could it be not good?

410
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,820
Calm down.

411
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,820
Do you need me to go with you?

412
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,820
Why are you back?

413
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,820
You have a private plane now.

414
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,820
I don't have a private plane.

415
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,820
But I'm in Taipei now.

416
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,820
So you don't have to tell me when you're back?

417
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,820
Yeah.

418
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,820
You don't have to tell me now.

419
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,820
That...

420
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,820
You go first.

421
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,820
It's okay.

422
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,820
I'm sorry.

423
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,820
I should have let you know.

424
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,820
No, no.

425
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,820
I'm sorry.

426
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,820
I'm really bad.

427
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,820
I'm so sorry.

428
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,820
You didn't say that five minutes ago.

429
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,820
Stop talking so much.

430
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,820
But what about the will?

431
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:34,820
I'm the unkind lawyer.

432
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,820
How long have you been back?

433
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,820
I'm not sure.

434
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,820
Is everything okay in Singapore?

435
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,820
It's hard for a person.

436
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,820
But we chose it.

437
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,820
Right?

438
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,820
Yes.

439
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,820
But I didn't know at first.

440
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,820
Is there any other option?

441
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,820
No.

442
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,820
It's okay.

443
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,820
I still have a plan.

444
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,820
I'll tell you when I'm back.

445
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,820
I'll tell you when I'm back.

446
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,820
Don't worry.

447
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,820
I know you two are in a relationship.

448
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,820
I'll go tell them.

449
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,820
I'll go tell them.

450
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,820
I'll go tell them.

451
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,820
I'll go tell them.

452
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,820
I'll go tell them.

453
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,820
I'll go tell them.

454
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,580
I'm waiting for you at the beef noodle restaurant.

455
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,220
I'm the first one to come back.

456
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,300
Hey, you old man.

457
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,700
When did you buy this?

458
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,420
You're not even good enough.

459
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,300
If you don't have the strength,

460
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,220
don't make excuses over there.

461
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,780
Hey, let's go.

462
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,460
They're all over there.

463
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,100
Hey, wife, I'm leaving.

464
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,900
Hey, don't run away.

465
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,940
I think he doesn't like this one.

466
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,180
I think this one is good.

467
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,860
This one.

468
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,420
This one doesn't have a smile.

469
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,420
Hey, old man.

470
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,700
I've been picking this one for a long time.

471
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,260
What do you think?

472
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,260
Let me see.

473
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:34,900
Okay?

474
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,940
This one is not good.

475
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,460
This one is not good.

476
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,580
It should be.

477
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,980
This one, old Tang will definitely like it.

478
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,300
This one?

479
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,220
We were just looking at it.

480
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,340
Let me see.

481
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,340
How about this?

482
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:48,740
Okay?

483
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,700
Then this one.

484
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,060
Okay?

485
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,020
Okay.

486
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,260
Then we'll decide.

487
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,700
Okay, that's good.

488
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,900
This one is good.

489
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,260
That's good.

490
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,780
Wife.

491
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,660
Where is this?

492
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,780
This is your house.

493
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,380
What about old Tang?

494
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,300
Old Tang went to ride a bike.

495
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,300
He'll be back soon.

496
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:23,300
I haven't eaten beef noodles for a long time.

497
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,300
Dear Tang's friends, thank you for coming.

498
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,300
Last week, Tang went to the hospital for a flu vaccine.

499
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,300
He got a new disease.

500
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,300
He passed away the day before yesterday.

501
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:44,300
He asked me to tell you to remember to ride your bike.

502
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,300
He's on the road now.

503
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,300
He's on the road with me.

504
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,300
I've come to my senses.

505
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,300
I'll stop talking to you.

506
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,300
Old Tang and I are fake friends.

507
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,300
He just retired.

508
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,300
He's not happy.

509
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,300
I knew he liked to ride with me.

510
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,300
He came too.

511
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,300
He was even more obsessed with it than me.

512
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,300
Once, we fell down.

513
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,300
I don't remember when.

514
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,300
He broke his leg.

515
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,300
It was very serious.

516
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,300
My daughter said, don't ride anymore.

517
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,300
I said, I have to ask Old Tang.

518
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,300
If he doesn't retire, I won't.

519
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,300
Old Tang said,

520
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,300
tomorrow night, the official will come to see him.

521
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:45,300
He said, I'm a very sincere person.

522
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,300
I love drinking like you.

523
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,300
Why don't you bless me?

524
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,300
He said, I ride a horse.

525
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,300
You ride a Superlini.

526
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,300
I can't catch up.

527
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,300
Right?

528
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,300
It's not funny.

529
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,300
It's not funny.

530
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,300
The one who can understand the joke

531
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,300
is already laughing in the sky.

532
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:22,300
Old Tang, let's continue riding.

533
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,300
Be careful on the road. Don't ride too fast.

534
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,300
If I were your big brother,

535
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,300
I wouldn't be so responsible.

536
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,300
You're my mother.

537
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,300
How long will you take care of me?

538
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,300
You're taking care of your parents when they're healthy.

539
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,300
Where are you when they're not?

540
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,300
Where are you?

541
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,300
If I don't beat him today,

542
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,300
I won't believe him.

543
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,300
Brother, don't say that.

544
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,300
Will he take care of us if he gives us more?

545
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,300
What are you arguing about?

546
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,300
Your mother is inside.

547
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,300
Do you have to go to this room to argue?

548
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,300
Wu Bei Bei, it's my brother.

549
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,300
Wu Bei...

550
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,300
Can you give me a business card?

551
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,300
Sure, you can consult me if you have any problems.

552
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,300
Okay, thank you.

553
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,300
Uncle, what happened to your car?

554
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,300
My car is a bit stuck.

555
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,300
The brakes are a bit loose.

556
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,300
I need to check it.

557
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,300
Don't ride it if you want.

558
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,300
I'll let you know when the car is here.

559
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,300
You're right.

560
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,300
Thank you.

561
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,300
Bye.

562
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,300
Wu Bei...

563
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,300
Wu Bei...

564
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,300
Wu Bei...

565
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,300
Wu Bei...

566
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,300
Wu Bei...

567
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,300
Wu Bei...

568
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,300
Wu Bei...

569
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,300
Wu Bei...

570
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,300
Wu Bei...

571
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,300
Wu Bei...

572
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,300
Wu Bei...

573
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,300
Wu Bei...

574
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,300
Wu Bei...

575
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,300
Wu Bei...

576
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,300
Wu Bei...

577
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,300
Wu Bei...

578
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,300
Wu Bei...

579
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,300
Wu Bei...

580
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,300
Wu Bei...

581
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,300
Wu Bei...

582
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,300
Wu Bei...

583
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,300
Wu Bei...

584
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,300
Wu Bei...

585
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,300
Wu Bei...

586
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,300
Wu Bei...

587
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,300
Wu Bei...

588
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,300
Wu Bei...

589
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,300
Wu Bei...

590
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,300
Thanks.

591
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,300
We're here.

592
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,300
I want to see Zhang Zan.

593
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,300
Sir, we're here.

594
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,300
We're at the bus terminal.

595
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,300
Where are we?

596
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,300
This is the bus terminal.

597
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,300
Where is it?

598
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,300
Where is the Anxin community?

599
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,300
We've searched the Anxin community.

600
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,300
Anxin community

601
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,300
Anxin community

602
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,300
Anxin community

603
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,300
Brother, the medicine is ready.

604
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,300
Just need to take the black one.

605
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,300
The waist is twisted.

606
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,300
It's fine if it's a fall.

607
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,300
Don't think too much.

608
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,300
I'm going to the toilet.

609
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,300
I'm going to the toilet.

610
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,300
You're still dirty.

611
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,300
The things should be in the right place.

612
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,300
The food is in the kitchen.

613
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,300
The clothes are in the laundry.

614
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,300
The garbage is in the trash can.

615
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,300
The fire station is in a fixed place.

616
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,300
You taught me how to put things in such a big place.

617
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,300
Do you know when you went out today,

618
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:31,300
you left the key on the door and forgot to pull it out?

619
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,300
It's really worrying.

620
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,300
Why are you so worried?

621
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,300
You've been away for so long.

622
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,300
Why are you suddenly concerned about me?

623
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,300
Don't think I don't know.

624
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,300
You didn't even take your medicine.

625
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,300
I'm not healthy.

626
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,300
What medicine should I take?

627
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,300
You're drunk.

628
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,300
You said you're not drunk.

629
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,300
It's fine.

630
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,300
I'm fine.

631
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,300
I'm not sure if you're right.

632
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,300
I'm begging you.

633
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,300
If you're not feeling well,

634
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,300
I don't have time to take care of you.

635
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,300
And I have to find time to clean up.

636
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,300
I don't need your care.

637
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,300
You're so messy.

638
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,300
How are you going to find things?

639
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,300
You like to clean up.

640
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,300
Go and clean up your room first.

641
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,300
When you leave home,

642
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,300
put all your things in my house.

643
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,300
My house is not your warehouse.

644
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,300
Where's my DV?

645
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,300
It's thrown out on the balcony.

646
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,300
It's thrown out?

647
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,300
No one's using the machine anymore.

648
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,300
You don't throw things away.

649
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,300
It's not a waste of time.

650
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,300
You can't just throw it away.

651
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,300
Throw it away?

652
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,300
You can just throw me away.

653
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,300
I'm telling you one last time.

654
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,300
You're not allowed to touch my things.

655
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,300
Okay.

656
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,300
I won't touch it.

657
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,300
Where did you go today?

658
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:09,300
Uncle Tang asked me to go to Wanjing City to ride a bike.

659
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,300
But he suddenly died.

660
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,300
Did you hear that?

661
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,300
Uncle Tang died.

662
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:21,300
They said he died from a flu.

663
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,300
How did he leave so suddenly?

664
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,300
It's so normal.

665
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,300
It's so normal.

666
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,300
It's normal.

667
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,300
A flu vaccine can cause death.

668
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,300
It's very unlikely.

669
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,300
You didn't hear me say it.

670
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,300
Uncle Cheng died from a flu vaccine.

671
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,300
Is it Uncle Tang or Uncle Cheng?

672
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:04,300
They said the bodies need to be washed and cleaned.

673
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,300
They need to be paid.

674
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,300
The family needs to go.

675
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,300
They asked me to go.

676
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,300
What am I going to do?

677
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:18,300
I used to go to the mountains with Tang.

678
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,300
He's taking a shower alone.

679
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,300
What am I going to do?

680
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,300
Look.

681
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,300
Look.

682
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,300
Look.

683
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,300
I'm going to the mountains with Tang.

684
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,300
I'm going to the mountains with Tang.

685
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,300
I'm going to the mountains with Tang.

686
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,300
I'm going to the mountains with Tang.

687
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,300
I'm going to the mountains with Tang.

688
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,300
I'm going to the mountains with Tang.

689
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,300
I'm going to the mountains with Tang.

690
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,300
I'm going to the mountains with Tang.

691
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,300
I'm going to the mountains with Tang.

692
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,300
I'm going to the mountains with Tang.

693
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,300
I'm going to the mountains with Tang.

694
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,300
I'm going to the mountains with Tang.

695
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,300
I'm going to the mountains with Tang.

696
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,300
I'm going to the mountains with Tang.

697
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,300
This...

698
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,300
What is this?

699
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:36,300
Other people will cry when they read your will.

700
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,300
Why would I cry?

701
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,300
One, go to Jiaming Lake to find aliens.

702
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,300
Two, five days and four nights to film.

703
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,300
Three, repair the bicycle.

704
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,300
Four, go to the environment again.

705
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,300
Five, eat the sacred steak.

706
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,300
Six, find time to watch Lele's talk show.

707
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,300
Seven...

708
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,300
Why is my talk show ranked first?

709
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,300
I'm ranked sixth in my talk show.

710
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,300
I'm not even as good as a steak.

711
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,300
Are you serious?

712
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,300
Shouldn't you also review it?

713
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,300
You've never invited me to your talk show.

714
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,300
I feel embarrassed when you sit in the audience.

715
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,300
Why would I be embarrassed?

716
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,300
You're my biological daughter.

717
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,300
You're not my biological daughter.

718
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,300
Technically, you're just a helper.

719
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,300
At least I'm doing well.

720
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,300
Did you say bad things about me

721
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,300
when I was in the audience?

722
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,300
Let's not talk about this.

723
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,300
Okay, here.

724
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,300
Ninth, take a photo.

725
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,300
Don't you think it's too late

726
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:39,300
to write and explain this in the will?

727
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,300
I'm afraid I'll forget it,

728
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,300
so I have to write it down.

729
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,300
You gave the new suit to Liu.

730
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,300
Why don't you give it to him now?

731
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,300
Why are you sitting here?

732
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,300
Don't you think that

733
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:55,300
we didn't do what we wanted to do?

734
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,300
This isn't a will.

735
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,300
This is a wish list.

736
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,300
It's...

737
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,300
Do you really think a will is for living people?

738
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,300
A will is for people who are watching secretly.

739
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,300
Are you bored?

740
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,300
Write it down for me to watch secretly.

741
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,300
I wrote you a text message.

742
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,300
You don't even have time to read it.

743
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,300
So I have to write a will.

744
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,300
I'm your daughter.

745
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,300
I'm not Lala Mu or Uber Yi, okay?

746
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,300
Actually, everyone thinks

747
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,300
that the important things are different.

748
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,300
Okay, I know now.

749
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,300
I'm in sixth place in your heart.

750
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,300
If you think I wrote it wrong,

751
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,300
then give me your will as a reference.

752
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,300
What reference?

753
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,300
I'm not ready to write a will.

754
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,300
Let me tell you.

755
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,300
You're living alone now.

756
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,300
It's the same as me.

757
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,300
Maybe no one can help you with the rest.

758
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,300
Okay, I know.

759
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,300
You have to think about it.

760
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,300
Okay, I...

761
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,300
What?

762
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,300
You've already read it.

763
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,300
You've completed your task.

764
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,300
I'm going to make instant noodles.

765
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,300
Do you want to eat?

766
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,300
I don't like instant noodles. I don't want to eat instant noodles.

767
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,300
Why can't you remember this?

768
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,300
If you don't want to eat, then don't eat.

769
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,300
Do you want to eat watermelon?

770
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,300
I have frozen watermelon.

771
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,300
Take it back to Zhang Kai to eat.

772
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,300
I'm going back.

773
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,300
Stay and eat.

774
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,300
I'm going to eat tomorrow.

775
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,300
Tomorrow, tomorrow, always tomorrow.

776
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,300
Fortunately, I have tomorrow every day.

777
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,300
Hi, everyone.

778
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,300
Today, the cold air report

779
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,300
will start to drop after the recording.

780
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,300
I'm going to take a shower.

781
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,300
I'm going.

782
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,300
I'm going.

783
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,300
Jball

784
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,300
It's impossible for such a friend

785
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,300
to give up shopping

786
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,300
and take the hot eighth.

787
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,100
I've been craving ice cream lately.

788
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,300
You don't have the right to. You need to take care of yourself.

789
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,300
Do you think I have time to take care of myself?

790
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,100
You really look very dry.

791
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,600
Let's go.

792
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,100
I really need this.

793
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,500
My skin has been so dry lately.

794
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,100
Let me wipe it for you.

795
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,300
You're not going to stand on the stage in the middle of the show, are you?

796
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,100
I have makeup on.

797
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,500
You're so advanced. I can't tell.

798
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,700
Here you go.

799
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,700
You can wipe your face with this.

800
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,700
Who's going to die?

801
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,900
Have you ever written a book?

802
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,500
Come on.

803
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,100
Why are you asking me such a humiliating question?

804
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,700
Of course I have.

805
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,900
You're even crazier than I thought.

806
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,300
No, have you ever seen this?

807
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,700
A mass-producing device.

808
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,300
What is this?

809
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,500
The basic information.

810
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,500
Write it down.

811
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,700
Then here.

812
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,500
Business accounts, arrangements,

813
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,500
and all the financial distribution.

814
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,700
You're serious.

815
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,500
I'm not too serious about the field.

816
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,500
Just in case the company wants me to plan something for the end of the year.

817
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,300
So you planned it a few years ago

818
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,500
and went to Switzerland. Is that considered a field?

819
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,700
It is.

820
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,700
But I think the death of a person

821
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,700
should be something that they can make their own decisions.

822
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,500
That's too much.

823
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,500
I call this a little bit of a nightmare.

824
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,300
You have your family.

825
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,100
If you really have a good plan,

826
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,100
there will be a lot of people who will help you.

827
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,500
What about me?

828
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,900
I'm alone.

829
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:50,500
I always need to arrange and handle things.

830
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:54,500
Your parents look like they're not here.

831
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,900
But they can't send me away.

832
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,100
Look.

833
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,900
Like Facebook, computer,

834
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,700
bank account, and all these passwords.

835
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,900
I always need to arrange and handle things.

836
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,500
If I die, someone will help you.

837
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,900
And us?

838
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,300
Do you really have someone?

839
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,300
What do you mean?

840
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:18,300
Sometimes when you need someone, you really have someone.

841
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,500
That's right.

842
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,500
Being single is only a matter of loneliness.

843
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,100
You can't be afraid of trouble.

844
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:30,100
Because no one needs to be responsible for other people's lives.

845
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:39,700
I'm not sure if my dad is really old and has dementia,

846
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:43,700
or he's just crazy.

847
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:47,700
Last week, he just finished his last book.

848
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,100
He wrote the last book himself.

849
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,100
He invited me to go with him.

850
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,100
I was so happy.

851
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,100
I was so happy.

852
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,100
I was so happy.

853
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,100
I was so happy.

854
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,100
I was so happy.

855
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,200
He wrote the last book.

856
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,700
He invited me to take a picture with him.

857
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,300
When I saw the contents of the last book,

858
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:14,300
I had a feeling that he wrote it in his dementia.

859
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,300
What is the content of the last book?

860
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,300
Going to the temple to eat steak.

861
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,300
Going to the Lake Jiaming to find an alien.

862
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,300
Then blah blah blah.

863
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,300
I was thinking where is the last book?

864
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,300
This is called the wish list.

865
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,300
Just call it

866
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,300
This is how you look at your daughter's backup

867
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:35,300
So she wrote a diary just like I used to

868
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,300
It was all for others to peek

869
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,300
You know? My old diary

870
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,300
I used to write

871
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:46,300
October 2nd, Sunday, the weather is nice

872
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,300
Today the weather is nice

873
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:52,300
I just want to stay at home and read

874
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,300
And the next day I will see my dad on the top of the foot

875
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,300
I got caught peeking

876
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,300
Math question

877
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,300
If you are 40 now

878
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:06,300
How much time do you think you have left to spend with your parents?

879
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,300
If you can only eat once a month

880
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,300
If your parents are still alive

881
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,300
And can live to be over 80

882
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,300
Let's see

883
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:20,300
How much time do you have left to spend with your parents?

884
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:24,300
How much time do you have left to spend with your parents?

885
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,300
If you are tired, go home early

886
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,300
You still have a lot of time tomorrow

887
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,300
The answer is 15 days

888
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,300
There are only 15 days left

889
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,300
And in these 15 days

890
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,300
She will be in a place

891
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,300
When you find her

892
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,300
She will be in an old area that she can't control

893
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:02,300
Until she can't decide for herself

894
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,300
Thank you

895
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,300
Can you take a picture with the tree for me?

896
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,300
Can I?

897
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,300
Is it worth it?

898
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,300
Yes

899
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,300
Take a picture

900
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,300
The whole tree

901
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,300
Take a picture of the top of the tree

902
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,300
Okay

903
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,300
One, two, three

904
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,300
So I have to make a decision now?

905
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,300
Because the cost

906
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:26,300
If you go back to confirm with your dad

907
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,300
Then we can still talk to the music

908
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,300
Thank you

909
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,300
Doctor

910
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:38,300
I think my dad will think he is sick

911
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:41,300
So your judgment and decision will be more important

912
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,300
Miss Chan, you must have a psychological preparation

913
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,300
Your dad's cognition will be more and more deformed

914
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,300
Then maybe in the end

915
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,300
You are the only one who can make a decision

916
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,300
So if you can think about it as soon as possible

917
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,300
Maybe it will be better for the patient

918
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,300
I'm sorry

919
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,300
I'm sorry

920
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,300
I'm sorry

921
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,300
I'm sorry

922
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,300
I'm sorry

923
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,300
I'm sorry

924
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,300
I'm sorry

925
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,300
I'm sorry

926
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:20,300
I'm sorry

927
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,300
I'm sorry

928
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,300
I'm sorry

929
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:23,300
I'm sorry

930
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,300
I'm sorry

931
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,300
I'm sorry

932
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,300
I'm sorry

933
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,300
I'm sorry

934
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,300
