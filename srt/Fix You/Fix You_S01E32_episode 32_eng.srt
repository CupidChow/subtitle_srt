1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,100

2
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,410
What are you doing here? You haven't left yet?

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,420
Oh, right... I was just feeling the breeze.

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,440
Well, the breeze does feel nice,

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,590
but have you had dinner? 
 - Yes.

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,510
Have you not been able to contact anyone?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,700
Dr. Lee...

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,980
I used to have a bit of money before.

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,170
At that time, a lot of people sought me out.

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,600
But now I don't have money

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,610
and have just become a body that enters and leaves the hospital.

12
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,420
Nobody will even look at me.

13
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,840
Even though I'm very normal right now.

14
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,950
Would you like a second dinner?

15
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,860
I'm... kind of hungry.

16
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,520
- I think I can find some places you can rest. 
 - You?

17
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,970
There's a shelter that the government runs.

18
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,580
What if you stayed here temporarily? Until you find your family.

19
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,540
Can I do that?

20
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,630
Yes, if you spend some time there, the social welfare workers can also help you find a job.

21
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,340
Does the hospital normally help patients with this kind of stuff?

22
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:35,520
Our social welfare team does help people who need help,

23
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,970
but our hospital is thinking of improving and expanding our resources for their work.

24
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,520
Wow...

25
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,610
Don't be too upset at your family.

26
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:50,030
If you do that, you'll become depressed again. Wouldn't that be upsetting, if that happened again after all your treatment?

27
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,980
- Right? 
 - Right.

28
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,950
If you find yourself suffering again because you don't have the friends and family you need,

29
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,790
you can come visit the hospital any time.

30
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,040
I'll be your friend.

31
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,390
- Okay? 
 - Thank you.

32
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,470
We'll go into a plie in first position.

33
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:15,090
Extend your arm and dip, ready?

34
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,030
Let's raise your arm a bit and drop your shoulder.

35
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,570
Raise your arm and drop the shoulder.

36
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,160
Please gather your fingertips. Perfect.

37
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,630
One more plie.

38
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,580
Okay, okay.

39
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,450
Hold the bat, and move your right foot back and your left foot forward.

40
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,460
You can't hold the bat like this.

41
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:14,970
You'll hurt your hand that way. This way.

42
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,070
This is-

43
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,750
- Oh my... 
 - You did it! You hit it!

44
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,880
- That was the last one. 
 - I'm pretty good!

45
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,310
Dr. Noh, why did you pick psychiatry?

46
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,070
Because of Dr. Lee Si Joon.

47
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,900
To be honest, I was going to apply to general surgery

48
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,340
but I changed my mind after I met Dr. Lee as an intern.

49
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,810
What about Dr. Lee made you change your mind?

50
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,490
- He looked lonely. 
 - What?

51
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:01,130
But that also seemed cool, too.

52
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:05,850
Treating patients, even though he himself felt lonely.

53
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,490
You totally fell for him.

54
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,630
Right now, I think I've fallen for you.

55
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,340
I haven't.

56
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,030
You haven't?

57
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:21,290
- I haven't! 
 - Stop joking!

58
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,420
Ms. Han Woo Joo.

59
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,060
Yes?

60
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,420
Please head inside.

61
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,450
Thank you.

62
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,660
You even made an appointment. What's the occasion?

63
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,910
I wanted to ask you something,

64
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,890
but I felt bad about always showing up out of the blue.

65
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,380
I know that I've changed a bit.

66
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,720
Can you feel it?

67
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,170
I couldn't get used to myself,

68
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,410
but Dr. Lee told me this.

69
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:01,870
I didn't change. I've always been this person.

70
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,570
I've been able to adjust after I heard that.

71
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,270
What did you want to ask me?

72
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,330
Is it about the new study you're doing?

73
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:16,630
Yesterday, I felt some new emotions, but I was curious as to what that was.

74
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,230
What kind of emotions?

75
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:26,700
I was just walking outside, and coincidentally saw a family that looked so happy.

76
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:31,770
A mom, dad, and a kid that looked maybe 5 or 6?

77
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,100
They looked so happy I couldn't take my eyes off of them.

78
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,140
I stared at them for a while,

79
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,760
and I suddenly felt so pitiful.

80
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,900
I've never thought of myself as pitiful.

81
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,230
When someone saw me as pitiful,

82
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,520
I actually got angry, asking if they were expressing sympathy.

83
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:07,300
But yesterday, I... felt so pitiful.

84
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,240
I can't even express it in words.

85
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:18,490
Dr. Ji, I know that I have borderline personality disorder.

86
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:24,540
Am I feeling these new emotions because of that condition?

87
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:29,400
I've become a lot better because of Dr. Lee and my mom's letter.

88
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,640
But is it going to start all over again?

89
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,470
Ms. Woo Joo, what did you think

90
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:40,130
after you felt that you were pitiful for the first time?

91
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:43,480
I think of myself as pathetic.

92
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,490
I... I've never loved myself.

93
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,050
Before, you got angry when others pitied you,

94
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,290
but now you've felt that you want to be cherished and loved?

95
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,850
Yes.

96
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:02,520
- Ms. Woo Joo, you've become even better. 
 - What?

97
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,130
The fact that you felt pitiful and pathetic for your past

98
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:10,030
means that you've started to love yourself.

99
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,310
Your mind has become larger and deeper.

100
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,840
Some diseases are not meant to brush off,

101
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,560
but wrap.

102
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,900
So don't try to force yourself to change.

103
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,330
Once you spend time together with your conditions,

104
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:39,990
it'll naturally become a part of yourself that helps you to grow.

105
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,000
Okay.

106
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:53,720
I think that the Vice President's condition is worse that I thought.

107
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,060
How so?

108
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,810
Yesterday, he suddenly said he thought there must be wiretapping in his room,

109
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,780
and showed signs of paranoia.

110
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,840
Goodness...

111
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,320
Well, he did recognize right after the incident that he'd crossed a line.

112
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,180
He probably has a lot of things pent up.

113
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,930
Everything he's done was to become the clinic head.

114
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,760
I'll try talking to him.

115
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,600
- Before that, what if we help relieve his sense of feeling of being wronged. 
 - How?

116
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,030
This is all because of me.

117
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,950
So what? Are you going to let him curse you out?

118
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,710
Well, there's no reason I can't.

119
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,660
You're really...

120
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:45,240
Starting from now, you can pick a picture that most resembles yourself or that you can best express.

121
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,380
Calm your mind and please pick carefully.

122
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,930
If you've all selected an image, we'll present them.

123
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,680
Ms. Woo Joo, would you like to start?

124
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,550
Why did you pick an image of a jelly fish?

125
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:24,030
I picked a jelly fish because I liked the way it lives in the ocean.

126
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:31,710
They aren't strong enough to swim against the current, so they just drift along with it.

127
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:35,710
Things in the ocean die if they're not strong enough to swim in the ocean.

128
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:40,050
So it found its own way to live.

129
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:47,900
Moving forward, I want to live life a bit more relaxed, like the jelly fish.

130
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,630
I hope you'll be able to do that.

131
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,020
Ok, next up--

132
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,980
Why do you keep coming here? I'm not a patient.

133
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,860
Forget about what happened yesterday.

134
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,780
I was just temporarily out of my mind. I'm completely fine.

135
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,950
Dr. Lee, you shouldn't do that.

136
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,100
So you became the clinic's head. Do you have to rub it in?

137
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,820
When there are all those people who rank above you?

138
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,990
You always looked down on me.

139
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,740
Didn't you? Didn't you look down on me?

140
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,970
You looked down on me for not having gone to a great college like the others.

141
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,070
Just say it.

142
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:23,790
While we worked at this hospital together, have you ever eaten a meal with me? A drink?

143
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,660
You told the other kids to ignore me and made me an outcast.

144
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,080
You only like Park Dae Ha.

145
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,920
You shouldn't do that.

146
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,030
Do you know what's the saddest thing in the world?

147
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:36,480
When someone under you looks down on you.

148
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,990
What did he even say? I couldn't hear a single word he said with these.

149
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,400
Oh?

150
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:13,190
Vice President, please get well soon.

151
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:17,440
Since you are sick, Vice President, it's hard to do our work.

152
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,840
Why are you suddenly being like this?

153
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:23,740
Vice President, do you know who Intern Kim Young Seok respects the most at Eun Kang Medical Center?

154
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,530
It's you, Vice President.

155
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:29,040
It's true. I respect you, Vice President.

156
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,350
You two interns, you will need to decide your specialty soon.

157
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,130
Have you decided?

158
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,290
I've decided on psychiatry.

159
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,250
So please take good care of me from now on.

160
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,550
And you, Kim Young Seok?

161
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,240
I haven't decided yet. It's a lot harder than I expected.

162
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,760
You said you respect me, so you should come to our department.

163
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,310
I will put some deep thought into it.

164
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,800
 Psychiatrist Ji Young Won

165
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:30,470
I heard you became the clinic's head. I wanted to congratulate you.

166
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,600
Do you have time today?

167
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:40,050
You've heard about Dong Hyuk going to Johns Hopkins, haven't you?

168
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,910
Yeah.

169
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:45,260
I heard that Dong Hyuk confessed his feelings.

170
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,770
He even told you that?

171
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:50,470
He was worried about whether you'd accept him, so...

172
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:56,580
I haven't told him yet but I intend to accept his feelings.

173
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,790
But why haven't you told him?

174
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:02,470
If I told him, he might decide not to go to Johns Hopkins.

175
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,980
Wow, you really are a considerate person.

176
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:12,260
- Young Won, take good care of Dong Hyuk.
 - What do you mean?

177
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,030
Well, it feels a little bittersweet.

178
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:20,470
Leave Dong Hyuk to me from now on, stop worrying about others, and take care of yourself now.

179
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,280
- And stop worrying about Han Woo Joo.
 - Why do you mention her all of a sudden?

180
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,990
She came to see me earlier.

181
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,280
I was a little surprised.

182
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,210
She used to barge in suddenly.

183
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:36,110
But today, she even made an appointment and left when her time was up.

184
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:39,010
She's changed a lot.

185
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,090
Woo Joo has so many secrets now.

186
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,300
I don't know what she's doing, but she's so busy and she won't tell me when I ask her.

187
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,460
- Is that so?
 - Do you know, by any chance?

188
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:53,470
I do, but I can't tell you due to doctor-patient confidentiality.

189
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,700
Fine, I won't ask.

190
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:03,460
Si Joon, Woo Joo has begun to love herself.

191
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,310
You know what that means, don't you?

192
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:09,840
So she doesn't need as much help from others as before.

193
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,430
She found her own way.

194
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,750
Yes, I knew she could do it.

195
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,290
Good job.

196
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,080
Why did you run?

197
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:35,900
Well, I saw you, and my steps became faster without my realizing it.

198
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,210
What's up?

199
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,470
I was curious whether the chorus practices were going well.

200
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,610
Don't worry about the chorus.

201
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:50,260
Han Woo Joo will make borrow strength from the whole universe to make sure that it is great.

202
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:55,370
Because Dr. Lee Si Joon will become the head of the clinic.

203
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,460
What else?

204
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:03,990
I suddenly had the thought that I should greet you.

205
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,340
What kind of greeting?

206
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:12,690
A very long time ago, there was an incident involving my first patient.

207
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:16,070
Right here at the Han River.

208
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:23,400
So for a very long time, I couldn't come near the Han River.

209
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:27,880
But now, I can comfortably talk about what happened back then.

210
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,860
And I can walk here, like nothing is wrong.

211
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,950
Thanks to you Woo Joo, I overcame my trauma.

212
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,700
Thank you.

213
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,160
- So what happens to us now?
 - What do you mean?

214
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:54,750
We've both overcome our pain due to each other.

215
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,510
Then what happens to us?

216
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:02,150
I was curious about that, what would happen to us?

217
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,880
Nothing changes.

218
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,070
I will look after you, and you will look after me.

219
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,690
One on one.

220
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:20,200
You and I will continue to walk side by side.

221
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,490
And as we walk, if one of us stumbles, the other will help.

222
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:27,760
And if it becomes difficult, we can rest together,

223
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,410
and we will walk together, like that.

224
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,240
Because everyone is in their own universe.

225
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,160
Yes.

226
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:52,190
Hello? I wanted to speak to Father on the phone.

227
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:57,370
Can you give the phone to Father, please?

228
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:07,140
Father, you can hear my voice, can't you?

229
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:10,440
I have something I wanted to tell you.

230
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:15,230
I became head of the clinic.

231
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:18,800
Eun Kang Medical Center's Mental Health Clinic Head.

232
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,820
That makes you happy, too, doesn't it Father?

233
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,000
I think you'll be a bit proud of me from now.

234
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,480
I know you're not speaking, but I think you're very happy inside.

235
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,500
Police officer Cha Dong Il.

236
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,900
Hello.

237
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,840
I heard the news. Congratulations.

238
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,540
Gosh.

239
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,580
- Did you come to practice?
 - Yes.

240
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,110
- But can you sing well?
 - I cannot.

241
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,280
You say that you cannot sing so confidently.

242
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,700
But it's fine, everyone is gathered and doing it together.

243
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,760
I know.

244
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,920
Your voice is low, so you can sing bass.

245
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,960
No, I want to be a baritone.

246
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,950
Sure, do what you want.

247
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,970
Everyone is here, right?

248
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,870
- Then let's begin.
 - Yes.

249
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:23,130
Music please.

250
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,490
Two, three, begin.

251
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:32,330
♪ Pleasures and palaces
 "Home, Sweet Home," Sir Henry Bishop

252
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:37,380
♪ Although they call to me

253
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,860
♪ There's no place like home

254
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,380
Hold on.

255
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,650
The rhythm is great for the very first time.

256
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,760
Let's just pay a little more attention to the tune.

257
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,610
And try to match your breathing with the person next to you.

258
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,530
Two, three, begin.

259
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:57,770
♪ Pleasures and palaces

260
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:03,050
♪ Although they call to me

261
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,340
♪ There's no place like home

262
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,980
Hold on, hold on.

263
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,330
When we say "do" someone keeps shouting.

264
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,340
So let's just work on that tone.

265
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:18,120
Do...

266
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,270
Will this chorus work?

267
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,510
I may have been mistaken about this.

268
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,610
Two, three, begin.

269
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:36,090
♪ Pleasures and palaces

270
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,040
Did I say that?

271
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,010
I think he said it before too.

272
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,670
What's funny about that?

273
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:45,300
- Welcome.
 - Welcome.

274
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,840
Oh stop.

275
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,370
Go and sit down.

276
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,800
Sit here, please.

277
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,510
This is your first time at Kong Rice House, isn't it?

278
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,720
So this is your secret hideout, huh?

279
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,120
Have a drink.

280
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:05,820
Vice President, this is on the house, especially for you.

281
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,620
Thank you, we will enjoy it.

282
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,430
Enjoy your food.

283
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,650
 Is there such a thing as a cure?

284
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:18,010
 As treatment begins the moment you acknowledge that you are ill,

285
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:21,930
 a moment that you are cured can exist as well.

286
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,420
Woo Joo...

287
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,620
You've been through a lot.

288
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,640
It's been difficult, right?

289
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,440
You've worked hard.

290
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,160
Thank you.

291
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,260
I love you, Woo Joo.

292
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:28,410
 In order for a disease to be cured, there is a condition that must be met.

293
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:32,760
 Instead of trying to erase your scars,

294
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,470
 you could acknowledge them, accept them, and love them.

295
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:46,670
 All our scars become a map to help direct us in our lives.

296
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:52,830
 Thus, instead of trying to overcome your wounds,

297
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:55,740
 what if we embraced them?

298
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:07,640
Our wounds are like the navigation systems of our lives.

299
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,710
Someone once said

300
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:13,520
all people in the world is their own universe.

301
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,150
I will leave you with these words today.

302
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:22,400
This has been 'Soul Mechanic'.

303
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:40,150
Hello! I am Lee Si Joon, the Director of the Eun Kang's Mental Health Clinic.

304
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,060
Thank you for coming to celebrate the opening of our new clinic today.

305
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:01,480
Starting now, we will watch the performance our hospital's doctors and patients have prepared.

306
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:07,610
Musical actress Han Woo Joo will be conducting the performance today.

307
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,920
♫  What's the use of irritation?   ♫

308
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,950
♫  What's the use of anger?  ♫

309
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:40,660
♫  There are so many sad things  ♫

310
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,550
♫  We shrug and live on  ♫

♫  When your worries stack up,  ♫

317
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,600
 Hurry up and take my blood!

318
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,440
 Take my blood!

319
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,210
 Don't die because of someone like me!

320
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,490
 I'm... really, really sorry.

321
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,750
 - Give it. 
 - No!

322
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,210
 Give it to me!

323
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:32,220
 You can't drink this!

324
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,750
 I wonder how a 15 yr old mind can be this complicated.

325
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,490
 Citizens of this Nation!

 I'm really sorry.

00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,560
 I'm really sorry.

331

You've been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder?

341
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:02,840
You're wondering if this disease is curable.

342
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:08,380
It'll take some time, but you can improve.

 Musical Actress Audition

344
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,680
Hello. My name is Han Woo Joo.

345
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,310
I'm so nervous since it's been a while I last stood on stage.

346
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,540
I'll try my best.

347
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:58,140
The heterogeneity in terms of individual response to anti-psychotic treatment

348
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,020
and the current inability to predict response

349
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,990
leads to a trial and error strategy with treatment choice.

350
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:12,520
In psychotic depression, the combination of an anti-psychotic and anti-depressant

351
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,500
is more effective than...

352
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:19,130
Based on our last consultation and your most recent psychological assessment,

353
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:24,050
you started feeling depressed after a traumatic event.

354
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:27,520
Starting now, we'll start discussing

355
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,010
the accident you were involved in.

356
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:33,410
Will that be okay?

357
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,820
- Dr. Park. 
 - Vice President.

358
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,750
- Do you know where the Clinic Director is? 
 - I'm also looking for him.

359
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:46,400
He won't even pick up his phone. Where is he? There are so many things we need to discuss.

360
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,020
I'm so angry with him as well.

361
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:51,310
What did I say! I told you he can't be the director!

362
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:55,510
I'm sure he's out with a patient again. I'm sure of it.
