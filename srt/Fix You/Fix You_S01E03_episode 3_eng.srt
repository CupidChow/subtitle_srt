1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,230

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:13,020
A victim earlier. A perpetrator now.

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,550
Aigoo?

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,360
It looks like you've been investigated for assault several times already.

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,910
I'll let you go because the victim didn't want to press charges,

6
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,980
but you will be fined for the damages to the car.

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,640
You can't go around swinging a baseball bat whenever you want.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,450
- You'll get into trouble that way.
 - Can you just punish me?

9
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,380
- What? 
 - Just lock me up!

10
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,580
If you don't, I might just go kill that bastard!

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,820
Just lock me up.

12
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:59,650

13
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,700
Excuse me...

14
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,490
What? Do you have something to say to me?

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,640
I know this might be a shameless request,

16
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,420
but could you please agree to settle?

17
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,310
I, as the patient's doctor, am responsible for what happened.

18
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,120
It's all my fault.

19
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,960
I'm really sorry.

20
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,040
Why do I have to be so generous?

21
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,280
After 10 long years, I finally thought things would start working out for me.

22
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,990
It only took an instant for me to become a criminal.

23
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,950
If that wasn't enough, I was betrayed by my boyfriend.

24
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,510
I'm about to be labeled as a crazy woman now that I've been  investigated for assault.

25
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:12,080
Why do I have to be so generous given my circumstances!

26
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,590
Why do I have to settle!

27
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:24,960
I really was imprudent.

28
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,540
It doesn't matter if you apologize. I won't agree.

29
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,060
I understand.

30
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,570
I'm really sorry.

31
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:55,240

32
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,390
I heard this wasn't the first time this patient escaped.

33
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,170
How is Lee Si Joon going to take responsibility for this?

34
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:13,320
What if we just dealt with it by transferring the patient somewhere else?

35
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,590
You're saying you want to just let this slide?

36
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:21,280
Lee Si Joon is an acclaimed doctor, and the face of our department.

37
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,540
The face is something we can replace.

38
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,210
He's already booked out for the next year. At least, for the  sake of our patients...

39
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:34,020
You know I've already let many issues slide for that reason.

40
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,610
Think of this time as the last,

41
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,980
please, Director.

42
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:48,160
Manager Park, who is Dr. Lee to make you bow your head in front of me?

43
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,490
Does the psychiatry department not run without Dr. Lee Si Joon?

44
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,700
I have to take responsibility as well, as the manager.

45
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,530
Cut Dr. Lee's research funds immediately.

46
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,490
That's a bit...

47
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,280
Okay. I understand.

48
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,140
Manager.

49
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,990
What about patient Cha?

50
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,260
He's being held at the station. He'll be taken into prosecution tomorrow.

51
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,830
When he comes out, transfer him right away.

52
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,660
- What?
 - You promised.

53
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,390
If he escaped again, you said you would transfer him.

54
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,840
Let's not discuss it anymore.

55
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,380
Why are you being like this? Are you telling me to just abandon my patient?

56
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,720
Are you the only doctor in the world? Are you the only person who can fix Cha Dong Il?

57
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,920
If he hasn't gotten better under your care until now, it must mean your ways are wrong!

58
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,970
You've never considered that, have you?

59
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,530
I am not wrong.

60
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:13,820
This is your problem. Do you not think you've made that patient worse?

61
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,540
 Stop right there!

62
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,630
 I told you to stop!

63
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,810
 Get out of the way!

64
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,850
 This way, please.

65
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,760
 Please cross.

66
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,570
 Thanks.

67
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,270
 It's a bit salty.

68
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,360
 Why did you put so much soy sauce on it?

69
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,600
 Was I really wrong?

70
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,840

71
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:09,220

72
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,850
What more do you have to say to me? I thought I made myself clear yesterday.

73
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:24,240
Patient Cha Dong Il. Please let me treat him.

74
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,170
Dr. Lee, is this something to be stubborn about?

75
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:36,010
If his primary doctor changes now, it'll become more difficult to treat him.

76
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,280
You don't think you're the best doctor out there, do you?

77
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:48,080
The relationship between a psychiatrist and their patient is really important for treatment.

78
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,550
If that relationship is broken, the patient will feel betrayed.

79
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,720
They could take extreme measures from the shock.

80
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,280
Are you trying to frighten me?

81
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,530
Can't we hold it off at least until the trial results come out?

82
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,100
I will do whatever I can to try to get the victim to settle.

83
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,150
Does that patient not have a family?

84
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,720
Why are you going to such lengths?

85
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,620
Isn't our hospital known for being like a family for the patients?

86
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,480
Please reconsider.

87
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,330
Hello everyone!

88
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,730
Hello.

89
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,820
Hi.

90
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,270
Hello!

91
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:57,940
Hello!

92
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,020
Han Woo Joo, what are you doing here?

93
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,500
What do you mean? I'm here to practice.

94
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,240
Didn't you hear from the director? I told him to cut you.

95
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,700
Where's the director? What's his deal?

96
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:17,410
Sir, it's been revealed that I wasn't drinking under the influence.

97
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,020
I know I was publicly shamed in front of the nation,

98
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,160
but it was just an incident, and everyone knows that patient—

99
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,140
Who doesn't know that? Being an actress is all about the image!

100
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,120
Who cares about the truth?

101
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,900
Haven't you been online? Everyone is talking about you.

102
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,430
How can we use an actress who was dragged off stage in handcuffs?

103
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,770
Do you want to ruin the show?

104
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,250
I'll ask for them to correct the published article.

105
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,930
Sir, I'm the victim here.

106
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:50,370
To be honest, this wasn't the only issue. There were issues at the last performance too.

107
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,100
- That's— 
 - I heard you're seeing a psychiatrist.

108
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,030
Is that the reason I'm getting cut?

109
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:05,010
The director says he feels burdened by you,

110
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,040
and they all say they're scared of you.

111
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,350
What are you all doing?

112
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,880
Hurry up and practice!

113
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,240
Yes, sir.

114
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,350
You all need to focus. There aren't many days until the performance.

115
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,650
Yes, sir.

116
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,670
One...

117
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,600
Two...

118
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,460
Three...

119
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,180
Four.

120
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:58,140
Five.

121

156

157

What are you doing here?

158
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,730
Are you hurt?

159
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:53,730
I'm actually here to see him. The fake cop.

160
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,200
Where is he? I can visit him, right?

161
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,220
He's not here.

162
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:01,870
Why not? You're hiding him from me, right?

163
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,010
He's being prosecuted.

164
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,240
Since you're here anyway, you should get that treated. You hurt yourself.

165
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,060
Forget it.

166
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,970
If you leave, there will be risk of infection.

167
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,080
Even small scratches need to be treated properly.

168
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,850
Bacteria could get into it, and it could get infected.

169
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,880
From there, if it gets worse,

170
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,510
you might have to amputate it.

171
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,090
Are you trying to frighten me?

172
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,750
Why are you trying to meet my patient?

173
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,110
You can't sleep here.

174
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,140
I'll leave after I get some sleep.

175
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:09,150
This is a hospital, not a hotel.

176
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:14,280
I like it here. It's busy.

177
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,490
You live for moments like this.

178
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,900
Dr. Lee.

179
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,010
Are you on call again?

180
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,230
Woo Jung hasn't been able to go home for the last few days.

181
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,810
Dr. Lee, I really respect you.

182
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,600
It sounds like flattery, not respect.

183
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,920
That's not true.

184
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,980
I keep smelling alcohol, where is that from?

185
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,430
Unnie Woo Joo?

186
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,190
Do you know her?

187
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,920
She's friends with my older sister.

188
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,190
Really?

189
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,910
Is she hurt?

190
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,780
She's just out because she drank too much.

191
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,100
I'll wake her up right now.

192
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,590
Let her be. You don't always have to be bleeding for it to be an emergency.

193
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,480
 Rookie musical actress arrested by fake cop for DUI

194
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,330
Are you busy?

195
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,230
Have you not eaten dinner yet?

196
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,720
I'm eating right now, thanks to you.

197
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,670
You sound energized.

198
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,120
Are you happy you're busy?

199
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,260
Why did you call? It seemed urgent.

200
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,950
I want to refer a patient to you.

201
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,000
What kind of patient?

202
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,250
She can't control her anger.

203
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,060
How bad is it? Do they have IED?

204
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:17,530
She says it influences her quality of life,

205
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,240
but you'd have to meet her to know for sure, right?

206
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,330
Why are you trying to refer her to me?

207
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:25,330
We've had 11 consultations, but she isn't making any progress.

208
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:28,540
There's so little progress that I'm starting to lose confidence.

209
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,070
You know I get depressed without validation.

210
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:36,270
Gosh, you're so fussy. Okay, I'll meet her.

211
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,050
You've already met her.

212
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,050
Who is it?

213
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,090
Han Woo Joo.

214
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,930
 Where am I?

215
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,550
 What is this?

216
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,330
 Where is this?

217
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:35,610
 What are you doing here?

218
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,150
 I'll leave after I get some sleep.

219
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,410
 This is a hospital, not a hotel.

220
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,730
I'm crazy...

221
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,460
I'm crazy... absolutely crazy.

222
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,860
What's up with this?

223
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,250
Hey! You know we're low on beds.

224
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,040
Yet you let a drunk just sleep? Is this a hotel?

225
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,760
The ER is for patients in an emergency.

226
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,310
Do you need to be bleeding or have a ruptured organ to be considered an emergency patient?

227
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,250
Are those words or crap?

228
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,410
My patients have a right to the emergency room as well.

229
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,930
Hey, watch where you sh*t.

230
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,680
Do you know how many emergency patients we send away because we don't have enough beds?

231
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,020
What if she had caused a ruckus in the emergency room?

232
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,060
You call yourself a psychiatrist, yet lack common sense?

233
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:37,060
Last time you— Hey. Hey!

234
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,990
Hey, you jerk— I'm not the guy I used to be!

235
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,180
Are you running away?

236
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:54,890
I've been caught.

237
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,690
Follow me.

238
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

239
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,520
You were kind of cool earlier.

240
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,640
"Do you need to be bleeding or have a ruptured organ to be considered an emergency patient?"

241
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,690
You really are an actress.

242
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:27,430
You seemed like an emergency patient yesterday.

243
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,640
Was I mistaken?

244
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:35,700
I was cut from the show, even though I practiced until my lungs gave out for the last two months.

245
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:41,220
I was supposed to be the victim, but I was turned into the perpetrator because of my temper.

246
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,730
 She can't control her anger.

247
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,640
 How bad it is? Does she have IED?

248
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:54,330
She says it has influenced her quality of life, but you'd have to meet her to know for sure, right?

249
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:59,820
The worst part of all is that my boyfriend cheated on me, but he claims it's my fault.

250
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,900
Because of my temper. Does that make any sense?

251
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,100
He's total trash.

252
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,900
- He's a jerk. 
 - Is that enough?

253
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,160
Don't you know how to swear?

254
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,900
I'm going to pluck this seed-like tongue of yours and turn it into a fly trap!

255
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,540
You mean something like that?

256
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:26,030
Yes, that. You're very good.

257
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:29,620
I may look very dandy and refined,

258
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:33,030
but sometimes I get frustrated too. One moment, please.

259
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,540

260
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,620
The worst craziest dog-like jerk I've ever met!

261
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,440
Like eighteen cups of ssanghwa tea!

262
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,900
Should I change the order of your rib bones for you?

263
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,780
Why don't you

264
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:02,030
disappear to the Siberian plains, you jerk!

265
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,060
Now I feel like I can breathe a little.

266
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:16,610
I've been wanting to swear at someone since earlier.

267
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,770
Where can I learn that kind of profanity?

268
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:23,550
I get sworn at a lot, from here and there.

269
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,290
Please use it when you need.

270
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:36,970

271
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,670
 I'll agree to settle.

272
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,740
I feel grateful.

273
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,460
Dr. Lee, patient Cha Dong Il is here.

274
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,610
How's his condition?

275
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:19,430
He seems a bit down, but there seems to be nothing wrong with him.

276
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,940
He's with Gong Ji Hye right now.

277
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,700
He must have come to his senses at least a little after that incident.

278
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,410
This time I really won't let him off the hook.

279
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,180
Are you okay?

280
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,450
It's a present.

281
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,830
A present? For me?

282
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,070
Open it. Hurry.

283
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,740
Officer Cha, you're a chief now.

284
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,980
You've been working really hard lately, so we're promoting you.

285
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,590
Are you really giving me a promotion?

286
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,730
Is this real?

287
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,790
It's real.

288
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,470
Good work.

289
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:36,750
Do you know how helpful you've been while on patrol?

290
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:40,110
Preventing fights and catching pick-pockets.

291
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:42,490
Controlling the traffic, too.

292
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:47,290
Looking after drunks and getting attacked.

293
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:50,020
You've really been working hard.

294
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,130
We know!

295
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:57,120
We know you've acted more like a policeman than the real police!

296
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,420
Though you weren't a real officer, the things you've been doing

297
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:05,880
were far more impressive than those of any real officer.

298
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:14,650
So you shouldn't think of yourself as a failure.

299
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:20,050
Just because you didn't become a policeman doesn't mean you lived a failed life.

300
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:24,980
To us, you are a real police officer.

301
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:39,600
Thank you for your hard work, Cha.

302
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,520
You've worked hard.

303
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,200
You've really worked hard, Detective!

304
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,200
Detective!

305
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:06,660
 Delusions start occurring when one cannot accept themselves and their reality.

306
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:20,980
 Because you deny your identity, an alternate world is imagined.

307
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:26,240
 Ultimately, they believe in this alternate reality.

308
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:42,890
After I saw that picture, I thought something really traumatic must've happened to you three months ago.

309
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,830
You started thinking parasites were living in your body ever since.

310
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:51,780
Could you tell me what happened?

311
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:03,430
This is what he told me as he left:

312
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,360
"You're nothing more than a parasite."

313
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:25,910
 At times, sudden shock or trauma makes us not want to face reality.

314
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:34,070
 In psychological terms, delusional disorders

315
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:39,640
 are caused by excess dopamine in the brain.

316
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,560
Well, that's what scientists claim.

317
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,650
 The biggest cause is a broken mind.

318
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:54,870
 That's why you need a fixer, like me.

319
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:01,000
 Don't uphold yourself to the standards of others.

320
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,930
 Compliments and critiques,

321
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:09,730
 these are all things that will pass.

322
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,020
 It's only in the moment.

323
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,120
 No matter what your 'disease' may be, don't suffer alone.

324
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,480
I don't know what to do.

325
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,880
 If you can overcome it alone, that's not a disease.

326
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:54,640
Today, I

327
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,240
am in so much pain...

328
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,380
I'm scared and in pain.

329
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:11,730
 The moment you acknowledge your pain,  the healing process can begin.

330
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:16,350
The secret chatter of a psychiatrist.

331
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,750
This was "Fix You".

332
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:27,920
So you referred the musical actress, who was your patient, to Si Joon?

333
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,360
He hasn't replied to me yet.

334
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,750
You're not one to easily refer your patients to another doctor.

335
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,010
That patient has borderline personality disorder.

336
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:40,220

337
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,840
I didn't tell him she had BPD.

338
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:49,000
I knew he wouldn't take her if I told him. The patient isn't aware of it either.

339
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,860
Ji Young Won, you're in trouble. If Si Joon finds out, he'll go nuts.

340
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,530
That's why you need to help him.

341
00:29:56,530 --> 00:30:00,700
I want Si Joon to overcome what happened.

342
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,870
You worry a lot about him.

343
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:10,200
We're friends.

344
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,790
- Are you okay?
 - With what?

345
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:17,240
Do you still live with guilt?

346
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,600
It's not something I can brush off.

347
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,990
I want to help Si Joon. That'll help me.

348
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,190
♫  On an early morning day  ♫

349
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:38,570
♫  Filled with heavy fog,  ♫

350
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:45,400
♫  We were dragged away with knives and guns   ♫

351
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:52,600
♫  For what reason? Where are we going?  ♫

352
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,340
♫  Nobody...  ♫

353
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,430
♫   Answered...  ♫

354
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:02,170
Sorry. I'll try it one more time.

355
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:05,040
That's enough. You can head out.

356
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,450
You shouldn't do that during an audition.

357
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:16,040
You were talking about me, right?

358
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:21,470
I said you have a nice voice, but the song choice was a bit disappointing.

359
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:24,750
Can judges not even discuss those things?

360
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,990

361
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,680
I must be crazy.

362
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,970
Why am I like this?

363
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:51,420
Patient Kim Yu Ra's boyfriend suddenly broke up with her three months ago.

364
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:56,210
Her confidence plummeted from the shock, and led to her condition.

365
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,500
Young Won told me she wants to refer a patient to you.

366
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,020
Yeah, Han Woo Joo. I'm still thinking about it.

367
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,750
Why, you're not interested?

368
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:08,980
I'm grateful, but she agreed to the terms without any conditions of her own.

369
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,130
Then, shouldn't you help her?

370
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,440
Something keeps stopping me.

371
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,490
For now, I need to look into a few things.

372
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:21,010
See if she's a patient I can handle.
