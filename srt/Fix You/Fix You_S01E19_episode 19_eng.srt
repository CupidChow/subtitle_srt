1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,890

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,640
So are we dating now?

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,770
- Huh?
 - But you just said that.

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,460
That we are dating.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,290

6
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,640
Why would you be on your knees?

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,450
Is this something worth kneeling for?

8
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,970
I was acting, though.

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,220
- Acting?
 - Yes.

10
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,790
I wasn't being sincere, I was acting.

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,380
Can't an actress do even that much?

12
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,640
Getting down on your knees and pleading was all acting?

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,240
Why?

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,980
I guess my acting was pretty good?

15
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,710
But I haven't heard the Vice President's response.

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,180
He's not the one who broke your contract.

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,020
Then who was it?

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,730
Who fired me?

19
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,960
Whoever it is, nothing will change.

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,480
I will make sure you aren't let go from your position this way

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,050
so can you leave this to me?

22
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:10,850
I will find a way to solve everything, so Woo Joo, please just trust in me.

23
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,800
Shall we walk?

24
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,650
Go on ahead.

25
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:30,530
But why didn't you tell me last night? You must have completely exploded.

26
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,500
I held myself back.

27
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,440
Wow, amazing.

28
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:48,450
It was fascinating, but once 6 seconds passed, I really did feel calmer.

29
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,090
And once I was calmer, I could think about everything from the beginning.

30
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,630
You did well. Good job.

31
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,530
But what you said earlier... how can you say things like that so bluntly?

32
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,350
What do you mean?

33
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,550
 You two are dating, right?

34
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,310
 Yes. You're right. So what?

35
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,410
You were so powerful.

36
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,180
- I was acting, too.
 - Huh?

37
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,870
How about it? I am not a bad actor, am I?

38
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:33,280
Well, I.. should be heading back in now. Bye.

39
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,190
Oh, it's not this way. Okay.

40
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,810
I heard it was your doing. Why did you do that?

41
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,860
Then what about you?

42
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,830
I told you to be careful, so that no one would have any misunderstandings.

43
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,920
But by any chance, is it true?

44
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,420
Yes.

45
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,230
Why do you insist on living such a difficult life?

46
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,640
You know that better than anyone how dangerous the borderline personality is.

47
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,270
Someone died in front of your eyes, and yet you would date another borderline personality?

48
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:20,160
I thought about it a lot, too.

49
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,480
"What is wrong with me?"

50
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:28,810
"How foolish can I be that I am doing the same thing again?"

51
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,120
It began before I knew that she was borderline.

52
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,770
And I tried to stop, once I found out.

53
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,950
I even tried to stop seeing her a patient.

54
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,060
I really tried to stop seeing her, but I couldn't.

55
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,930
No matter how much I tried, I couldn't stop.

56
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,520
Can't you ever love someone normal?

57
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,520
So what is the line between normal and abnormal?

58
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,860
Can't you date someone who isn't a patient, just a regular person?

59
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,460
I'm a patient, too!

60
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,490
I was planning to ask Han Woo Joo to quit anyway.

61
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,940
But this isn't the right way.

62
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,730
Fine, since she is a patient, I won't cast her out.

63
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,630
But she can't do theatrical therapy anymore.

64
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,550
- You told me Hospital Director wants her to quit, too.
 - Chief.

65
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:26,100
Also, I think you require supervision.

66
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,740
From today, I am your supervisor.

67
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,680
Let's work clean, please?

68
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,720
And please reconsider.

69
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,490
Abandon this idea that you can fix everything.

70
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,490
 Someone died in front of your eyes, and yet you would date another borderline personality?

71
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,390
 Can't you ever love someone normal?

72
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:21,420
 This time is different from the last time. I will make sure that it is.

73
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,950
Thanks for bringing those patients today.

74
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,400
They all were excited to come,

75
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,350
though there was a bit of a fight at the end...

76
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,480
The fire fighter who got hit... is his face okay?

77
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,060
He said to tell you thanks for hitting him.

78
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,360
He said those kinds of things often,

79
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,910
that if he had only been dispatched quicker, those kids wouldn't have died that way.

80
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,170
So I guess I slapped someone who wanted to cry?

81
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,790
Yes.

82
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:54,660
Somehow, the people who should feel guilt are just fine,

83
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,810
and innocent people are living with guilt. I don't know why things are that way.

84
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,990
I know.

85
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,510
Young Won, are you Si Joon's closest friend?

86
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:09,280
- Why are you asking that, suddenly?
 - When it comes to PTSD, Lee Si Joon has it, too.

87
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,060
So I'm asking you to see him often.

88
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,290
Has something happened to Si Joon?

89
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,900
No, nothing.

90
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,750
Just that he only thinks of his patients, to an excessive amount.

91
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,160
He sleeps at the hospital every night, even these days.

92
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,660
Then I'll make sure I'm a good friend to him.

93
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,310

94
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,400
- Doctor.
 - It's been a while.

95
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,800
There are cars behind, so I'll be going.

96
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,610
Let's go together.

97
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,290
I have something to talk to you about, Doctor.

98
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,710
What is it about?

99
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:46,400
But Doctor, why did you see me and pretend not to?

100
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,550
Well, that's my choice.

101
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,570
Where shall I take you?

102
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,520
I heard No Woo Jung sunbae's patient died.

103
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,580
I heard that, too. So it's true?

104
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,450
Is that so surprising? It's something that happens often.

105
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,350
I was afraid of blood, that's why I chose psychiatry.

106
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:14,100
But after being an intern, I think psychiatry has much more scarier things than blood.

107
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:20,980
Do you know what is the first thing required to become a psychiatrist?

108
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,760
Ability to sympathize with others?

109
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,150
No, I think it's actually the opposite.

110
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,420
Isn't it better to lack sympathy, a bit?

111
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,120
In any case, you can't cry easily, and you need a hard heart.

112
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,870
If not, you could go crazy after listening to your patients' situations.

113
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,760
- Kong Ji Hee.
 - Yes?

114
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,080
Is something going on?

115
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,550
No, nothing is going on.

116
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,250
- Thank you.
 - Thank you.
 - We enjoyed the meal.

117
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,690
Ji Hee!

118
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,950
Go on ahead.

119
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,950
What? I have to go home soon.

120
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,510
What's with you, not even eating?

121
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,590
Something bad happened?

122
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,810
Why is Woo Joo dating the doctor? You know, Unnie, didn't you?

123
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,220
It's a long story.

124
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,030
What is wrong with Woo Joo unnie, anyway?

125
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,970
Why my attending, when there are so many men in this world?

126
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,530
They're not dating, Woo Joo just likes him.

127
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,690
But I saw everything.

128
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,530
She has no one to seduce, so she seduces my attending?

129
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:38,260
And how long will this last? She's just going to hurt him?

130
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,540
Don't speak that way.

131
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,360
And Woo Joo is the one always got hurt, she didn't hurt them.

132
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,030
Unnie, you should have stopped her.

133
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,170
I tried.

134
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,500
Woo Joo unnie and the doctor don't even suit each other.

135
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,650
Kong Ji Hee, what do you think you're doing right now?

136
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,270
Did you forget what Woo Joo did for you?

137
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:01,180
Saying you were smart and good in school, she gave you spending money and even bought you a computer.

138
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:05,570
All the money she earned teaching kids acting, she gave it all to you.

139
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,380
Why are you talking about this right now?

140
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,170
Because you're looking down on Han Woo Joo, aren't you?

141
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,230
Oh, this little...

142
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,210
- I wanted to see you, Doctor.
 - Is that so?

143
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:37,920
I am so sorry about last time, and there was something I wanted to talk to you about.

144
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,690
But you have Dr. Lee Si Joon now.

145
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:45,720
Next time, please discuss it with him. It's not a good idea to keep switching the person you consult with.

146
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,730
But, it's about Dr. Si Joon, so...

147
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,710
What is it?

148
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:04,160
Today, Dr. Si Joon 'declared war' with the Vice President.

149
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,170
And told him that we are dating.

150
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,790
He was so powerful when he said it.

151
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,080
So I'm really happy right now.

152
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:24,890
But I'm also worried, too.

153
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:30,790
How long will this last? I'll probably get abandoned again.

154
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,700
If it happens again, I feel like I really won't be able to endure it this time. So what do I do?

155
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:41,500
Maybe now, when I am so happy, I should run away?

156
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,180
What's wrong?

157
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,080
- Please listen well to what I'm about to say.
 - Yes.

158
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,750
Do you want to hear the 'doctor' version, or the 'neighborhood unnie' version?

159
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,430
'Neighborhood unnie' version.

160
00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:00,180
Han Woo Joo, do you know what we need in order to love someone? 
 (T/N: she's speaking casually to her, as if she's a friend)

161
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:05,110
Unconditional trust. Without it, you don't even have the right to love.

162
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:10,200
And it's all up to you. Being suspicious, getting angry, making people sick of you.

163
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,500
Of course anyone would leave. Who likes that?

164
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,680
Before worrying about such things, you just have to do your part properly.

165
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,270
I know some distinct characteristics about people like you. Don't suspect your partner.

166
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:24,550
Don't suspect him no matter what and just trust in him. Trust.

167
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,580
You seem very shocked. 
 (T/N: she's speaking formally to her again)

168
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,020
Shall I do it again in the 'doctor' version?

169
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:37,460
No. I'll heed your words well.

170
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:41,630
I will make an effort.

171
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,110
I've arrived.

172
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,290
Where are you?

173
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,490
Yes?

174
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,990
I missed you.

175
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,460
It hasn't been that long since we saw each other.

176
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:15,200
But that was when the sun was out, and now it's nighttime.

177
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,870
♫  The endless and dark night  ♫

178
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,930
I'm embarrassed.

179
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,990
Why don't I have any pride?

180
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:27,060
♫  When you don’t know where to go  ♫

181
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:32,920
 I missed you, too.

182
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,930
You just said something to me, didn't you?

183
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:40,380
No. I didn't say anything.

184
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,990
You did. What did you say?

185
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,490
I didn't say anything.

186
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,310
You did, you did.

187
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:53,050
- I'm telling you I didn't!
 - Lie!

188
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,680
- You drank a lot.
 - I did not.

189
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,570
- How about we walk a bit?
 - Yes, let's.

190
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:03,160
♫  Waiting for you and looking at you, like this  ♫

191
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:09,950
♫   I am the most grateful for that.   ♫

192
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:20,170
♫   Do you remember what I've told you before?   ♫

193
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,060
The moon is so pretty.

194
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,750
♫   When I think of you, it gets better.   ♫

195
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,220
What do we do when the moon is up?

196
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,940
Exercises.

197
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,730
♫   we can be each other's courage.  ♫

198
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,310
What kind of exercises?

199
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,450
Shaking exercises!

200
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,460
♫   At the end of a tiring day,   ♫

201
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,150
These legs are not mine.

202
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,770
These arms are not mine.

203
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,060
♫   I will always be there for you.    ♫

204
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,360
That's not it!

205
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,510
How do I do it then?

206
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,390
- You have to be more relaxed, like this. 
 - Oh...

207
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,140
If you keep your limbs light,

208
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,400
then your arms will rise on its own.

209
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,540
- As if they're not my own arms.
 - Lightly, like this.

210
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,510
- I don't think these arms are mine! 
 - I don't think these legs are mine.

211
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,710
Like this!

212
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:06,070
Your arms have to rise on their own.

213
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,030
♫  Let’s always walk together  ♫

214
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:16,260

215
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,260
Sorry, we're closed—

216
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,520
I saw the light was on from outside.

217
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,070
Just go ahead and sit down. I'll make it for you. Anything you especially want to eat?

218
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,350
Anything will do.

219
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,480
As long as I have the ingredients. What do you want to eat?

220
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,300
I guess you like banquet noodles?

221
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:55,030
I had a patient who frequently told me, 'Let's go eat banquet noodles together.'

222
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:59,930
Others usually say, "Let's go have soju or coffee."

223
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,300
But he always spoke of banquet noodles.

224
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,230
Why banquet noodles? I should have asked.

225
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:14,360
Maybe it was for some kind of hope?

226
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:19,570
Banquet noodles is something you usually eat when something good happens.

227
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:23,990
So maybe he was hoping for something good to happen.

228
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,620
Now that I think about it,

229
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,880
I think you are right.

230
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,560
I heard about your patient earlier, actually, Dr. No.

231
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,220
Be strong.

232
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,940
What is it?

233
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:59,640
You don't look so cheerful yourself, Ms. Kong.

234
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,310
But you're comforting me.

235
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,190
Well...

236
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:31,360
Let me repay you with music.

237
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,900

238
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,570
How are you these days? Sleeping well?

239
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,480
I plan to leave here. I've become a lot better, I'm fine.

240
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,700
What do you mean? You can't sleep at home, Oppa.

241
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,590
You have nightmares every night, screaming. Waking people up to evacuate them.

242
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,570
Mom and I cannot sleep because of you, Oppa.

243
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,120
Then I'll move out.

244
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,200
What, and go live with your wife who divorced you?

245
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,040
So what do you want me to do?

246
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,220
I see fire and smoke

247
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,000
and kids everywhere who are waiting to be rescued.

248
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,220
So stay here and get treatment.

249
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,280
Why are you so unusual, anyway?

250
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,540
Dozens of firefighters were there that day, why are you the only one who's acting this way?

251
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,850
Guardian, you must not raise your voice like that here.

252
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:34,250
And if you're going to speak to the patient that way, please leave and return on another day.

253
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,480
I'm fine.

254
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,160
Who are you to say this to me, anyway?

255
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,630
I am the person who is responsible for this ward.

256
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:45,190
If you mistreat a patient, even if you are his guardian, I can have you removed.

257
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:54,400
Guardian, please don't just leave and speak to his attending doctor.

258
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,440
Why do you keep telling me what to do?

259
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,760
If that made you feel bad, let me apologize.

260
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,700
But the family members are suffering as much as the patient, too.

261
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,670
So please visit him.

262
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,860
I don't need to do that.

263
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,630
So I will consider the contract with Han Woo Joo canceled.

264
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:21,150
But in order to process a few things, I request a little time.

265
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,800
How long?

266
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,400
It won't take long.

267
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,720
- Don't do that, please. There is no need.
 - What?

268
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,050
Chief Park, she may be a contracted employee, but still, can you fire her like that?

269
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,960
Thanks to you, I'm viewed as the irrational one.

270
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,870
Dr. Lee, just let Han Woo Joo work comfortably.

271
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,090
Of course,

272
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:49,730
until recently I didn't think a relationship between a doctor and his patient was a good thing.

273
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,290
So I said a few words out of my concern for Dr. Lee.

274
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:58,960
But seeing Dr. Lee's attitude yesterday, I realized this isn't something I should stop him from.

275
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,150
As they say, love does not know boundaries. Isn't that true?

276
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:09,620
Vice President, this work is so important to Han Woo Joo.

277
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,970
How can you think of making jokes about it, like this?

278
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,140
What?

279
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,050
Dr. Lee, you should leave now.

280
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,910
What did I do that he's acting like that?

281
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:32,280
Vice President, what in the world are you thinking?

282
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,050
About what?

283
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:38,060
You know that Dr. Lee doesn't care what other people think, and that's why you're doing this, isn't it?

284
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,000
That if they are in the same space, rumors will spread naturally

285
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,450
and they will be criticized for immorality, so they'll know to leave on their own.

286
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,360
You would really go that far?

287
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,090
Chief Park, isn't that why

288
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:54,790
you canceled Han Woo Joo's contract, to protect Dr. Lee?

289
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,960
Why do you think so little of Dr. Lee, anyway?

290
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,390
You're making me sad. When did I say I think little of him?

291
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:09,020
You're all twisted, Chief Park, not even seeing my sincerity.

292
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,370
Yesterday, regarding the firefighters who've suffered from similar damage

293
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:23,050
and their group therapy for PTSD, I think it was difficult for everyone to be satisfied with it.

294
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,290
My opinion is different.

295
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:30,530
Although it may not have been immediately satisfactory, I believe that repeated sessions will be effective.

296
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,500
I agree with Woo Jung sunbae.

297
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,780
Although they experienced similar damage, their symptoms are different and they were affected differently.

298
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,600
So I thought for them to fight during the first session is a natural response.

299
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,210
But the fact that they fought means

300
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,470
that to recall the memory of the incident is too difficult for them.

301
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:50,630
Even if we do group therapy, shouldn't they be able to deal with

302
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:55,000
the memories of their trauma at least a little bit, in order for it to be effective?

303
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,420
Kong Ji Hee, why don't you have an opinion?

304
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,720
I don't especially have anything to contribute.

305
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,880
I'm sorry.

306
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:10,740
For patient Baek Hong Min, I intend to treat him first with cognitive behavioral therapy before group therapy.

307
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,990
I will begin with theatrical therapy.

308
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:13,980
We will prepare for that.

309
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,330
I spoke to Woo Joo already, so look into that before we begin.

310
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:21,510
About patient Baek Hong Min, you said he had problems with his family relationships?

311
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,580
Shouldn't we also treat his family members, too?

312
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,730
That is true, but I don't think it will be easy to persuade them to be treated.

313
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:30,090
But that's Dr. Lee's specialty.

314
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,170
Me?

315
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:34,720
I would like his help, of course.

316
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,260
Sure, I'll try meeting with them.

317
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:43,410
I'll contact his family members first for you.

318
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:47,110
Also, I have an announcement.

319
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:52,720
And Han Woo Joo on the social welfare team who's been working with us,

320
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,590
her contract will be canceled.

321
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,360
Why so suddenly?

322
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,200
Looks like this theatrical therapy session will be her last.

323
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,700
She's returning to her original job of being a musical actress, so everyone cheer her on, please.

324
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:22,160
Why is Han Woo Joo suddenly quitting?

325
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:25,940
I fired her.

326
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,830
- You did?
 - The relationship between Si Joon and Han Woo Joo,

327
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,370
did you know about that, too?

328
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:33,750
Well, I did notice it, a little.

329
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,870
You knew that and just watched and did nothing? Aren't you his friend?

330
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:41,430
I thought she was experiencing transference and Si Joon knew that, so I didn't worry.

331
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:44,940
It's not transference. Those two people are sincere about their feelings.

332
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,270
- Si Joon actually said that?
 - He didn't deny it.

333
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:58,040
Chief, I know what you're worried about, but I'm sure it's different from 8 years ago.

334
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,560
That was Si Joon's first patient, after all.

335
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,600
So? I should just stand by and watch?

336
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,410
Young Won, who is a PTSD expert told me this.

337
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:13,070
For Si Joon to overcome his PTSD, he must experience another borderline personality.

338
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,620
Han Woo Joo.

339
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,800
Hello.

340
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,180
Do you happen to have some time right now?

341
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,770
- Right now?
 - If you're busy, another time is fine.

342
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:37,760
No, I have time.

343
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,820
Perhaps you've heard about me getting fired?

344
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,330
Yes, allow me to apology on their behalf, Woo Joo.

345
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:05,010
No. I was thinking about quitting, anyway.

346
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,730
So about that, what I requested your help with last time,

347
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:10,950
let's just say it didn't happen. You're probably not in the mood for something like that.

348
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:14,930
No, please don't. I want to do it.

349
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:18,190
Please give me a chance to leave this job on a beautiful note.

350
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,280
Will you really be alright?

351
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,860
Yes. I am really fine.

352
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,730
Let me finish it.

353
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:35,110
Then please take good care of us. Thank you.

354
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,830
Sorry, I'm a bit late, aren't I?

355
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,900
I think I told you that you have to observe consultation times no matter what.

356
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,310
Well, I was coming in

357
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:55,660
and Dr. In asked to speak with me briefly.

358
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:03,210
Can't you wait a little for me, for something like that?

359
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:06,860
You could meet him after our consultation. This was a promised appointment.

360
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,870
- I couldn't refuse.
 - Why not?

361
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:15,550
It was about something important. Dr. In requested my help with a theatrical therapy session.

362
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:19,840
Is that more important than your scheduled consultation?

363
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,980
Yes. It's important.

364
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:27,600
Of course it's important. It will be my last theatrical therapy session.

365
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,160
And can't someone be a little late?

366
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,770
He asked to speak with me briefly, to refuse would be rude.

367
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:39,430
Did you think you were being considerate to another person?

368
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,810
Why do you keep getting angry?

369
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:46,430
You're the one getting angry right now.

370
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,520
Could you really not refuse his request because of manners

371
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,230
or you knew you should refuse, but you didn't for another reason?

372
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:58,420
Fine. I've always been bad at refusing other people's requests.

373
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,240
Happy now?

374
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,100
It's time for my next patient's session.

375
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,760
As you leave, please make your next appointment with the nurse.

376
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:49,380

377
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:55,950

378
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,590
Ji Hee.

379
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:03,040
Do you have time by any chance? Have a cup of tea with me.

380
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,440
I'm busy.

381
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,270
Okay.

382
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:10,730
What's with her now?

383
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,830
Do you think I was wrong, too?

384
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,740
Doctor is right, you should have been on time for your consultation.

385
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,830
But he asked to see me about my work, how can I refuse?

386
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,540
That's your problem, your inability to ever say no.

387
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:35,060
Think about how much you missed out on because of that. Always getting ripped off by your adoptive father.

388
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:38,430
But why bring that up now?

389
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:41,710
I'm reminding you how meddlesome you can be.

390
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:44,810
This isn't about me being meddlesome.

391
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:48,630
You had an important appointment right away. That is obviously your priority.

392
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:51,250
Learn to say no, please.

393
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,080
Dr. Si Joon was really mad at me.

394
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,380
I doubt he was really mad.

395
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,580
No, his gaze had changed.

396
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,880
How?

397
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,430
It felt like he thought I was pathetic.

398
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:05,930
You're saying nonsense again.

399
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,880
- Ji Sun.
 - Yeah?

400
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,720
I've suddenly become nervous.

401
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,760
About what?

402
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,690
I think he's begun to dislike me.

403
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:21,090
Woo Joo, don't suspect people like that without any evidence. You're giving yourself a hard time.

404
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:23,740
But I have never seen him look that way before.

405
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,240
Will I be abandoned again, like this?

406
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,870
Oh...
