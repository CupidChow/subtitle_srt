1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,170

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,420
Doctor, eating lunch just now?

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,960
Did you speak to his family members?

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,490
I spoke to his younger sister, but she says she won't come to the hospital.

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,600
She says she can't make time because of work, but I think she doesn't want to.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,670
Where does she work?

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,290
She works at the borough office. She's a civil service worker.

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,770
What time does everyone leave work there?

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,500
Ah yes, I'm Dr. Lee Si Joon from Eun Kang Medical Center.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,790
You are the younger sister of Firefighter Baek Hong Min, aren't you?

11
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,620
Yes, I am his younger sister.

12
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,140
Is there something fun outside?

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,770
Just thinking about the past.

14
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,000
When would that be?

15
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,340
Elementary school.

16
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,080
Did something special happen back then?

17
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,300
Oppa's dream when he was younger was to be Superman.

18
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:25,570
He always loved to help others, so we thought being a firefighter suited him well.

19
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:30,820
But it didn't suit him at all. He had a difficult time, and suffered a lot.

20
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,070
After going to a car accident site, he wouldn't let us drive.

21
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:39,660
And after doing to a fire, he wouldn't let us even use the gas stove.

22
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,700
I should have made him quit his job earlier.

23
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,590
But isn't being a firefighter a difficult job for anyone?

24
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:51,280
In my opinion, the patient hasn't yet found the right treatment yet.

25
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,790
Then what must be done?

26
00:01:54,980 --> 00:02:00,610
How about if the family members all receive a consultation together?

27
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,790
I think that will be very helpful.

28
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,590
Of course, we don't want to force you.

29
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,720
Were you close with your oppa before?

30
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,480
I'm closer to him than our mom.

31
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,230
Why is that?

32
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,090
Our mother

33
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:23,910
abandoned us and left home for a few years when we were young.

34
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,280
Oh my.

35
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,540
You both must have had a tough time when you were young.

36
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,660
We were able to endure thanks to Oppa's homeroom teacher.

37
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:44,010
She took care of us like she was our mom. He still sometimes says that he missed her.

38
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,330
What kind of teacher was she?

39
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:51,140
When I was in 5th grade, my homeroom teacher,

40
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,500
she always hugged each student at the end of the school day.

41
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,180
 - I'll see you tomorrow.  
 - Okay.

42
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,630
 There we are. Be careful.

43
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,260
Goodbye.

44
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,790
- Take care, be careful of cars.
 - Yes.

45
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,670
Oh, our little scamp. Be well.

46
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,950
- Bye.
 - Oh, Hong Min.

47
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,100
Take care, be careful of cars.

48
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,850
Oh, our princess. Take care.

49
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:23,460
See you tomorrow, bye.

50
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,620
Be well. Take care.

51
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,610
Oh, be careful of cars.

52
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,550
I always made sure to get hugged twice. I liked her embrace so much.

53
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,910
I guess she's a grandmother now.

54
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:55,040
But you're trembling a lot when you speak about your brother.

55
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,970
Are you aware of it?

56
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,790
I do that?

57
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,750
This is a symptom of trauma as well.

58
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:07,110
Family members who suffer from trauma have a high probability of suffering again from trauma in the future.

59
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,330
I will treat you. Come to see me at any time.

60
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,610
I'm hungry, give me something to eat.

61
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,600
You can make it yourself.

62
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,570
Are you really going to be like this?

63
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,810
I'm disappointed in you.

64
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,930
But am I acting this way without reason?

65
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,020
I said that thinking about Woo Joo unnie's well-being, too.

66
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:44,530
A psychiatrist cannot date his patient. This is immoral, and it's something that a doctor will be seriously reprimanded for.

67
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,800
And do you know how popular my attending is?

68
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,140
There are so many doctors and nurses who like him. Those two will never last.

69
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,440
Hey, if you really care about Woo Joo,

70
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,660
you should cheer her on and help her, not stop her.

71
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,890
Woo Joo, were you there?

72
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,920
Hey Woo Joo?

73
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,020
 A psychiatrist cannot date his patient.

74
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,360
 This is immoral, and it's something that a doctor will be seriously reprimanded for.

75
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,390
 There are so many doctors and nurses who like him. Those two will never last.

76
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:55,720
♫  It's very strange  ♫

77
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,630
♫  I haven't done anything, but a day has passed  ♫

78
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:04,860
♫  As much time has passed today  ♫

79
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:11,700
♫  are you becoming more distant from me?  ♫

80
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,870
 Your call could not be connected.

85
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,870
Hello?

86
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,320
Okay, I'll be right there.

87

88

♫  I'm sorry, I miss you  ♫

92
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,340
Patient, are you alright? Please try to breathe slowly.

93
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,110
- Yes, slowly.
 - One, two.

94
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,420
- Inhale.
 - Doctor is on his way.

95
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,860
- Doctor.
 - Doctor.

96
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,960
Ho Yeong, I'm here, you're alright.

97
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,460
You're alright, you're alright.

98
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:37,510
Doctor, we gave him 0.25 mm of Alprazolam today. Shall we give him more?
  (Alprazolam = sedative to treat anxiety and panic disorder)

99
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:41,110
He can't take oral medicine like this, so prepare the Lorazepam.

100
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,240
I'll prepare that.

101
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,480
It's okay. You're okay.

102
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,300
Why are you doing this suddenly? You were fine for a while.

103
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:57,410
Did you have a nightmare or something? It's fine, it's fine.

104
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,770
 The call was not connected, so after the beep...

105
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,940

106
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:19,080

107
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:36,050
 The call was not connected, so after the beep...

108
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,280
Oh, I left it here.

109
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,410
 From Han Woo Joo

110
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,930
 48 missed calls

111
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,630
 The call was not connected, so after the beep...

112
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,050
Woo Joo, I'm sorry.

113
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:16,270
There was a patient having an emergency, so I couldn't answer my phone.

114
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:19,580
What is the meaning of this photo?

115
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,500
Are you alright?

116
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,300
What is it at this hour?

117
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:51,840
Young Won, Woo Joo just sent me a photo of her self-harm.

118
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,030
- What?
 - And I can't get in touch with her.

119
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:57,770
She called me dozens of times, but I couldn't answer it.

120
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,190
Si Joon, calm down. Where are you?

121
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,390
I did say some harsh words to her this afternoon.

122
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,050
Where are you right now?

123
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,400
Are you driving? To find Woo Joo?

124
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,630
Yes. I'll try going to her home.

125
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,960
Stop the car right now and listen to me first.

126
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,630
- But I have to hurry and get there.
 - Come to your senses, Lee Si Joon.

127
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,250
Han Woo Joo is a borderline personality. Did you forget?

128
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,860
You cannot go now. Stop the car right now.

129
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,190
You were going to date a borderline personality without even this much resolve?

130
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,140
Han Woo Joo won't die, she will not.

131
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,430
So stop the car right now.

132
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Han Woo Joo is just apprehensive right now, afraid that you will abandon her.

133
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,450
This is a pattern that is repeated for borderline personalities.

134
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,820
The moment she learned that you like her

135
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:57,100
for any small reason, she becomes afraid that you will leave her, so this is how she resists.

136
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,800
Lee Si Joon, you've already experienced all of this before.

137
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,350
If you accept this behavior now, she will do this again countless times.

138
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,970
Are you going to chase her like this every time it happens?

139
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:14,510
I'm afraid that something will happen to her.

140
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,070
I'm scared.

141
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,300
Nothing will happen.

142
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,190
I told you, Han Woo Joo is different from Jung Se Woon.

143
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:31,520
So don't worry and regain your rationality. That is how you can treat her.

144
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,360
 Woo Joo, I know how you feel.

145
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,820
 I know what kind of apprehension you are feeling. But remember this one thing.

146
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:27,180
 Anytime, anywhere, I will always go with you.

147
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,650
 The call was not connected, so after the beep...

148
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:13,880
Doctor, Han Woo Joo won't answer her phone.

149
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,750
What do we do?

150
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,640
Keep trying.

151
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,520
What happened to Han Woo Joo?

152
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,540
- She didn't come?
 - We can't even contact her.

153
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,760
- Just wait a little bit longer.
 - Has something happened?

154
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,640
If you don't think she will come, we need to reschedule this.

155
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,800
To be honest, I can't be sure.

156
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,420
Alright, I'll take care of this.

157
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,390

158
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,480

159
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,650
 The call was not connected, so after the beep...

160
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:16,390
PTSD Theatrical Therapy

161
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:20,140
Woo Joo stayed up all night to write that.

162
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:25,400
Woo Joo worked really hard at the national trauma center, as if they were her family.

163
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,410
I think her experience there was helpful.

164
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:31,790
Ms. Kong, you don't know where Woo Joo is right now?

165
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:35,590
Yes, something happened yesterday that wasn't good, so...

166
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:42,790
Doctor, to be honest, I cannot handle Woo Joo.

167
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:50,290
I will handle Woo Joo from now on. So leave her to me.

168
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:57,200
Doctor, you can eat at my restaurant for free for the rest of your life.

169
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,700
I will give you everything for free.

170
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,180
I eat well, and a lot.

171
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,690
Then I will cook a lot of food.

172
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,960
- Nothing much happened?
 - Yes.

173
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,750
- Oh, you do have a guest.
 - A guest?

174
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:20,930
Doctor. Doctor...

175
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,270
What brings you here without even a phone call?

176
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,550
Doctor, I'd like to stay here today.

177
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:37,530
I can't sit here, so I'll sit in your waiting room, that's okay, right?

178
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:41,420
I don't know what's going on, but this is a hospital, not a cafe.

179
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,410
This is more comfortable to me than a cafe, though.

180
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,890
Shall I tell you about a comfortable cafe, then?

181
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,540
I wanted to hang out, then speak with you.

182
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,470
If you need a consultation with me,

183
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:59,610
please make an appointment with the nurse outside, and come at that time.

184
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,400
Do you really want to see someone die for real?

185
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:11,920
Woo Joo, let me speak to you today with the 'doctor' version.

186
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:16,230
Woo Joo, I don't know what happened with you, but please don't try to force things.

187
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,610
Woo Joo, you are no longer the 6-year-old who went to the orphanage.

188
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:23,310
And you're not the 12-year-old who was sent away by her adoptive parents.

189
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,820
So can you please leave now?

190
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:55,900
♫  These moments we can just pass by.  ♫

191
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:03,290
♫  Even if you disappear from my sight,  ♫

192
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:08,350
 Woo Joo, I don't know what happened with you, but please don't try to force things.

193
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:12,070
 Woo Joo, you are no longer the 6-year-old who went to the orphanage.

194
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:15,720
 And you're not the 12-year-old who was sent away by her adoptive parents.

195
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:21,930
 But I am still 6 and 12 years old.

196
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,100
♫  Your existence is more than enough.  ♫

197
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,710
 You're alright, aren't you?

198
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:39,280
 But I'm not alright. I miss you.

199
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:45,970
♫  I can't live in a world without you.  ♫

200
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:53,050
♫  My heart hurts even imagining such a thing.  ♫

201
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:59,190
 Woo Joo, if you are apprehensive, I become apprehensive as well.

202
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:07,190
 I really don't say things like this, but you are making me say it many times today.

203
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:11,440
 I miss you. I miss you a lot.

204
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,830

205
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,250
No.

206
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,240
I better wait. Wait...

207
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,990

208
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:56,480

209
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,870
 Oppa endured because of his homeroom teacher.

210
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:32,180
 She took care of him like our mom.

211
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,790
 I thought you needed this.

212
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,470

213
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,750
Woo Jung.

214
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,830
- Doctor.
 - I found a way to treat Firefighter Baek.

215
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,070
What method?

216
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:57,350
It's like "safe zone" therapy, so he will receive comfort from the person he likes the most.

217
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:00,860
What shall I call it? The Recall Method.

218
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,820
Recall Method?

219
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:07,100
Recall the person you want to see the most in your life, and receive comfort from that person.

220
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,770
Han Woo Joo wrote a script using her experience of working at the national trauma center.

221
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,730
It happens to overlap with what I heard from his sister yesterday.

222
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,840
Then we better speak to Dr. In about this soon.

223
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:23,310
Dr. In said instead of theatrical therapy, he will start cognitive behavioral therapy soon.

224
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:28,170
Then how about we help Dr. In secretly?

225
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,520
How?

226
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,540
I think we will have to find someone first.

227
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,930
Wait for me!

228
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,150
Excuse me.

229
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,570
I'm Noh Woo Jung, Doctor of Psychiatry at Eun Kang Medical Center.

230
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:04,500
I'm looking for Teacher Gu Won Sook who used to work here.

231
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
Teacher Gu Won Sook?

232
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,500
Do you know her?

233
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,180
Buy shoes as well.

234
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,600
Buy shoes as well.

235
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,470
See butterflies as well.

236
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,360
See butterflies as well.

237
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,120
See a raccoon as well.

238
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,090
See a raccoon as well.

239
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:21,680
Cats walk gently.

240
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,030
Cats walk gently.

241
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,830
Butterflies flap their wings.

242
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,690
What brings you here?

243
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:33,410
Is Teacher Gu Won Sook here, she teaches Korean?

244
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:36,280
Who is looking for me?

245
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,800
You found her? Does she remember Baek Hong Min?

246
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,140
I don't think she remembers clearly, but I'll speak to her some more.

247
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,260
Good job.

248
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,340
Yes, thank you.

249
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,510
Yes?

250
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,490
Where are you right now?

251
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,790
In front of my home.

252
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:12,010
You're alright, aren't you?

253
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,170
I am alright.

254
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:19,500
I waited all day for you. Shall we meet now?

255
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,780
I'm very close by.

256
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,830
No. Let's see each other tomorrow.

257
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:50,600
Alright, let's wait some more.

258
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,760

259
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,840
You're prepared, aren't you?

260
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,230
Inhale and exhale deeply.

261
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,430
Close your eyes.

262
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,550
Right now, we will return to your

263
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:39,560
happiest time, Mr. Baek Hong Min.

264
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:43,490
We will call that place

265
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,950
the "safety zone."

266
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:50,660
Where is Baek Hong Min's safety zone?

267
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,720
My 5th grade classroom.

268
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,760
Then right now, let us go in there.

269
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,730
Who is in there?

270
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,030
My teacher is there.

271
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:13,190
What is your teacher doing?

272
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:19,360
She is smiling brightly and hugging all of us.

273
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,190
 - Be careful.
 - Thank you, bye.

274
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,500
 It's almost my turn.

275
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,300
 My heart beats faster as I get closer.

276
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,460
 See you tomorrow.

277
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,970
 Hong Min.

278
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:39,200
Why does your heart beat?

279
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,630
Our mother abandoned me and my sister and left our home.

280
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,290
So my teacher was like my mom.

281
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,400
  Hong Min.

282
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,040
I can hear Teacher's voice so vividly.

283
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,590
Hong Min, have you been well?

284
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,650
Teacher?

285
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,870
Baek Hong Min?

286
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:33,440
Oh... how did you come here?

287
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,890
Our Hong Min called me, that's why.

288
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:43,340
You must have had such a hard time.

289
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,810
I feel bad for you, what can I do?

290
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:53,070
How could you come all the way here?

291
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:01,230
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

292
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,720
No, no, Hong Min.

293
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:09,050
I'm very thankful that you called for me.

294
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,530
So, once more.

295
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:16,100
You always got two hugs, every time.

296
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,350
It's fine.

297
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,040
You did well, Noh Woo Jung.

298
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,820
Don't mention it.

299
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:41,270
The truth is, I didn't do this. This was in the script that Han Woo Joo wrote.

300
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:44,930
I just brought the teacher here.

301
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,110
I just thought...

302
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:55,360
that you might need this for official reasons.

303
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,190
I'm sorry.

304
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:03,560
You were so good at this job, I really wanted to continue working with you.

305
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,670
No, it's fine.

306
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,940
I plan to return to the musical stage.

307
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:15,350
I liked it here so much, I had forgotten my original job.

308
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:18,000
I'm grateful for the time we had.

309
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:23,530
You submitted a resignation letter to the social welfare team?

310
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,550
Yes.

311
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:29,330
I wanted to do the PTSD treament that Dr. In requested

312
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:32,110
and end things on a beautiful note. So I do regret that.

313
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,700
Then what will you do now?

314
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,000
I have so many things to do.

315
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,920
I have to practice singing again and go to auditions.

316
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,520
And even teach kids.

317
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:50,890
So I don't think I will have time to come here anymore.

318
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:53,030
What does that mean?

319
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:56,460
I will not receive further consultations.

320
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:00,090
I will no longer act like a patient.

321
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:08,060
Do you think you're prepared to stand on stage right now?

322
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:15,940
Of course, I agree that I still have a lot of problems with my personality.

323
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:20,900
But I want to try to overcome it without your help.

324
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:26,140
- Woo Joo.
 - You've become burdensome to me.

325
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:32,760
I wandered around all day long and thought about it objectively.

326
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:37,770
But it turns out, I do not like you romantically, Doctor.

327
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:45,770
I was under a delusion. If you are disappointed, I am sorry.

328
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:49,780
But when it comes to people, who knows how things will turn out?

329
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,810
Maybe some day, for real,

330
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,860
really...

331
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,610
I supposed I could like you again. Don't you think?

332
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:06,950
So I won't be coming to see you for consultation.

333
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,690
Then I'll go now.

334
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:14,190

335
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,800
Hold on, hold on.

336
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,670
What are you so apprehensive of?

337
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,810
You can't trust me?

338
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:28,790
No.

339
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:32,300
I don't suspect you.

340
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:36,120
I know that yesterday, you worried about me all day long.

341
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,480
♪  Would that protect me from this world...  ♪

342
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,150
And you waited in front of my home, I know that, too.

343
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,490
♪  ...that is only harsh to me?  ♪

344
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:45,830
Then... why?

345
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:50,800
Thank you for everything.

346
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:56,230
♫  Goodbye, the memories I want to forget.  ♫

347
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:06,950
♫   The diary where I wrote down all my sad thoughts   ♫

348

 Do you know Nurse Heo Min Young? I'm worried about her.

352
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:28,150
 The ICU ward is notorious

353
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,830
 When did Nurse Heo begin having a hard time?

354
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,760
 She plans on filing a civil lawsuit against Young Won.

355
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,580
 Is it alright for me to feel this happy?

356
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,890
 Who requested this of you?

357
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,490
 Cha Dong Il, what are you doing right now?

358
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:45,620
 Doctor, why are you suddenly interfering with the nurses' affairs?

359
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,940
 What you just said, I dare you to say it again!

00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,700
