1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,490

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:11,720

3
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,940
Why did you introduce me to Lee Si Joon?

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,530
I've asked you multiple times before.

5
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,340
What disease do I have?

6
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,690
But you never told me.

7
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:35,830
Issues come up in your relationships because you have difficulty controlling your emotions,

8
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,630
and you have an anxiety disorder characterized by a repetitive dreamâ€”

9
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,970
Exactly! So what disease is that?

10
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:47,240
Usually, we don't tell patients who have a personality disorder what it is they have.

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,200
Not only is it difficult to say for certain what it is,

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,480
but it also doesn't help with treatment if they are misinformed.

13
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,280
Personally, I don't think you have any handicaps relating to your every day life.

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,310
Sure, you often feel angry and have experienced difficulty in human relationships because of your wide range of emotions,

15
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,560
but everyone has flaws and uncertainties.

16
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,320
If you know me so well, why did you send me to another doctor?

17
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,790
That's because Dr. Lee is a better doctor than me.

18
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,590
Then you must be a bad doctor, right?

19
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,700
Why did you act like you didn't know Dr. Lee, all those times I talked about him?

20
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,440
- Weren't you just messing with me?
- Ms. Woo Joo.

21
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,200
You abandoned me!

22
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,170
Why are you angry right now?

23
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,040
Because I'm not making any excuses?

24
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,040
Because you just heard my reasons, and you're angry I introduced you to Dr. Lee?

25
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,200
No. The two of you had already met before I introduced you to him.

26
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,250
I knew you had met him, and then asked Dr. Lee to work with me.

27
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,720
The reason I am angry

28
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,980
is because you abandoned me!

29
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,760
Well, it doesn't matter much, because I'm so used to being abandoned.

30
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,520
My biological parents who abandoned me, my adoptive parents who dissolved my adoption,

31
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,330
you. You're all the same.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,440
I thought you'd be a little different.

33
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,390
Since you're a doctor.

34
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,810
I'm never coming back.

35
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:51,580
 So the reason Dr. Lee has been good to me this whole time is just because I'm his patient?

36
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,290
 Ms. Woo Joo! Ms. Woo Joo!

37
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:02,100
 Ms. Woo Joo! Ms. Woo Joo!

38
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,010
 Han Woo Joo!

39
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,530
That's not it. I saw it.

40
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,960
What I saw is real.

41
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,610
He was really concerned about me.

42
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,750
Ms. Woo Joo is furious. She thinks I abandoned her.

43
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,680
Don't worry about it too much.

44
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,930
Si Joon, I'm worried that she'll become more reliant on you.

45
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,010
I think she'll become more attached to you out of her anger for me.

46
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,360
She's already experiencing transference to you.

47
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,560
What should we do?

48
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,340
I heard you found the cause of Congressman Koh's tic symptoms.

49
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,560
Yes. I found out coincidentally, when I went to meet up with the train operators to discuss their panic disorder.

50
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,800
Good work. Good work.

51
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,460
The director was very pleased. You start the medicinal treatment.

52
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,700
Me?

53
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,350
Of course!

54
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:12,490
You're the one that figured out the cause. I'll take care of the other things to organize.

55
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,240
I'm a bit late, right?

56
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,620
No, it's okay. I was waiting inside, and just came out.

57
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,910
Let's head in.

58
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:23,280
Do we have to do the consultation in your office?

59
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,150
Well, not necessarily. Then shall we take a walk?

60
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,560
I'll decide on the location.

61
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,950
Who is that?

62
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,040
She's a musical actress helping out with theatrical therapy.

63
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,670
Oh, that person? What's their relationship?

64
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,580
There's nothing going on between them.

65
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,480
Linking arms doesn't mean anything?

66
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,860
Han Woo Joo is also Dr. Lee's patient.

67
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,890
Patient? What kind of patient?

68
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,570
Well about that... I don't know either.

69
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,320
Then what?

70
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,380
Lee Si Joon asked his patient to do part-time work?

71
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,490
She became his patient after she had already been hired.

72
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,990
Whenever I got abandoned by someone,

73
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,510
I took it as something to be expected.

74
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,460
Since even my birth mother abandoned me.

75
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,230
But you told me this.

76
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:28,740
That I'm not a kind of person who deserves to get cheated on by their boyfriend.

77
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,170
That I'm someone who changes the lives of others.

78
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:41,660
I... think we were fated to meet.

79
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,420
What do you think?

80
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,690
I wonder...

81
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,230
Rather than fate...

82
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,240
- I think there must have been a reason. 
 - A reason?

83
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,500
So what I mean is... Everything that happens to me,

84
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:10,620
whether it be good or bad, has a reason.

85
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,510
There must be a reason for why I met you.

86
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,850
That reason is fate!

87
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,760
It's a bit... different from fate.

88
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,240
Nope! This is fate, and it must be fate.

89
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,010
Otherwise, all the consolation I've gotten from you becomes a lie.

90
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,710
- Ms. Woo Joo- 
 - I'm going to leave now.

91
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,750
Y-You're leaving? I haven't even started the consultation yet.

92
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,450
We'll always have a tomorrow.

93
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,230
Goodness... She just dropped a bombshell.

94
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,450
Fate?

95
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,480
- Dr. Lee must've been flustered. 
 - Why would he be flustered?

96
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,390
I told you that he just thinks of you as a patient,

97
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:05,780
but if you keep talking about fate and whatnot, it's burdensome.

98
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,020
At first, I thought so, too.

99
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,310
I denied my own feelings.

100
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,740
Since I'm quite bad a controlling my emotions,

101
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,320
I thought, I must've just become interested in a doctor during a lonely time.

102
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,990
But?

103
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,930
But after going to the ocean, I'm certain.

104
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,250
We have a special relationship.

105
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:35,660
What? Are you thinking...

106
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,650
What kind of person who got abandoned by their biological and adoptive parents suit a doctor? Something like that?

107
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:45,560
Hey, you're being so-- I'm just worried you'll get hurt again.

108
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,680
I know why you're worried,

109
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,730
but Dr. Lee is different.

110
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:56,340
Look at Ji Young Won. She was so nice to me, but eventually abandoned me.

111
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,640
I only have Dr. Lee left now.

112
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,190
Dr. Lee is different.

113
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,690
He must be different.

114
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,990
Citizens of our nation...

115
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,820
Citizens of our nation...

116
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,970
Citizens of our...

117
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:44,370
Then it must only be a matter of time until Congressman Koh is fully recovered.

118
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,650
Of course!

119
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,740
Now, he can go out to the hearing in his normal state. If he gets questions about his tic,

120
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,130
don't you think he'll say he was able to fully recover because of the medical team at Eun Kang Hospital?

121
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,740
You've worked very hard on this case.

122
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,830
 Republic of Korea - National Assembly

123
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:23,610
I... am stepping down from candidacy of the Minister of Employment and Labor.

124
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:33,940
The reason for my resignation is not because of this tic that you can see.

125
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:41,480
For a long time, I've worked tirelessly for the safety of the Korean citizens in subway transportation,

126
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,620
as well as the quality of work of subway operators.

127
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,530
I made a promise to them as well.

128
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,690
2-man shifts. Reduction of working hours.

129
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:03,870
Reinforcement of safety. Favorable working conditions.

130
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:09,900
However, I was not able to keep any of these promises.

131
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,870
Because of the promises I could not keep,

132
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,830
yet another operator...

133
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:24,040
recently lost his life.

134
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,130
What you are seeing right now

135
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,530
is the price I'm paying for not keeping my promises.

136
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,270
 The person that can cure your condition

137
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,460
 is not me,

138
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,710
 but yourself.

139
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:56,530
 Of course, we can alleviate your symptoms with medication.

140
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,730
 However, this is just a temporary solution.

141
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,140
 A full treatment,

142
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,530
 only you can do that.

143
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:11,660
Thanks to this, I was able to reflect on myself.

144
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,700
Now, I feel a bit light minded.

145
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:24,670
From now on, through congressional action, I will address issues such as

146
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:29,700
employment security, abolishment of discrimination, and other regulations for the safety of laborers.

147
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,940
So that those who are working in the lowest positions of our society

148
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,130
are given the appropriate worth for their labor,

149
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,190
I will give all my strength to the effort.

150
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,330
Congressman Koh, I have a question!

151
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,180
Please answer our questions!

152
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,940
 Eun Kang Medical Center

153
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,990
If you've found the cause, you should fix his disease. Why would you discharge him?

154
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:55,240
The cause of his tic was due to stress caused by his own guilt.

155
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,680
I decided that it could only be cured if he could free himself from his guilt.

156
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,200
The only person who knew how to do that was Congressman Koh.

157
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,260
Why do we have doctors? If guilt is the cause,

158
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,250
then shouldn't you have helped him using whatever means necessary?

159
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,070
Why did you make him overcome that alone?

160
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,390
More than the medication and psychological treatment we can give at the hospital,

161
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,120
I determined that it would be much quicker for Congressman Koh to keep his promises to himself.

162
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,270
So that's why you let him go? So he could go keep his promise?

163
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:27,280
Well, I didn't intend for him to do what he did, but I think Congressman Koh thought that to be best.

164
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,470
Was it so difficult to just alleviate his symptoms with medicine,

165
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:35,800
so that at least he could go to his hearing? That's what everyone does.

166
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,000
Dr. Lee, you were a bystander to your patient.

167
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,290
You could have treated him, but you chose not to.

168
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:45,100
I was never just a bystander, nor did I give up on him.

169
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:51,020
As a doctor, I chose a method that would not just temporarily alleviate his symptoms through the use of medications.

170
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,020
I do not think my method was incorrect.

171
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:58,180
Above all, in order to have Congressman Koh fully recover-

172
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,880
Fully recover? Is this a surgical procedure? Why are you looking for full recovery?

173
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,490
Where does a full recovery exists in our department? You have to regulate it for life.

174
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,800
You're so arrogant. You're quite amazing.

175
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,050
Can you fix a disease without medication?

176
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,760
Of course not.

177
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,310
How can you take over a Mental Health Center when you can't even cure a patient's tic symptoms?

178
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:23,870
Vice President. Chief Park. Please recheck the evaluations.

179
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,900
Yes, I understand.

180
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:40,620
Director, do you really think I was wrong?

181
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,980
Was that really your best effort?

182
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,550
Yes.

183
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,690
I'm going to train some students,  but you should come with me.

184
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:55,920
Training? Isn't that for first and second year attendings?

185
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,810
So what?

186
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:04,520
Why are you angry? Okay...

187
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,860
We will now begin practicing how to respond

188
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,870
to emergency situations during a consultation.

189
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,960
The most frequent type of emergency that may arise

190
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,610
is when you are working with a violent patient.

191
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,280
Dr. Lee, step up.

192
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,050
Me?

193
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,050
Okay. Dr. Lee will act

194
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:36,020
as a violent patient.

195
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,140
Okay. Try attacking me.

196
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,650
What are you doing, in front of the kids...

197
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,620
Come on, try it.

198
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,450
Okay.

199
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:58,550
- Ouch... 
 - You all saw that right? You can take them out like this.

200
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,080
What are you doing?

201
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,170
- Come on, clear out. 
 - Oh gosh, my back...

202
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,020
Wait a sec. I think I twisted something.

203
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,720
Can you support me a bit more?

204
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,130
Why are you putting on that act? Hurry, go in.

205
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,890
What a crybaby.

206
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,930
It'll be simple if you can resolve the situation like this,

207
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,930
but there aren't many doctors who can do this, right?

208
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,780
Yeong Seok? Turn off the lights.

209
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,410
Okay.

210
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,270
When you're dealing with a violent patient,

211
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:37,470
the most important thing is your safety. 
 - Oh my back. I'm going to die...

212
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,440
Does it hurt a lot?

213
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,690
Dr. Noh, I really-

214
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,020
- Noh Woo Jung.  
 - Yes?

215
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,430
What should we do to a patient who refuses medication?

216
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:52,980
Um, you should first address the patient's fears and concerns.

217
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,070
Then try to listen to why they feel uneasy.

218
00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:00,200
We must ensure they understand the benefits of medication

219
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,940
outweigh the potential discomforts brought by any side effects.

220
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,120
Did I ask you?

221
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,700
- Chief. 
 - Yes?

222
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,790
There are frequent cases where patients experience a transference of their emotions to the physician treating them.

223
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,010
What do you do in that case?

224
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,210
Dr. Lee, you answer this one.

225
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,780
Um... when a patient is experiencing transference,

226
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,550
you must maintain a very neutral stance.

227
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,910
It's important to not be wavered by the patient's demeanor, whatever that may be.

228
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:37,130
Remember your duties as a doctor and maintain your objectivity.

229
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:44,740
Above all else, it's important to treat the patient as you normally would.

230
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,430
Is she really so happy?

231
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,660
Hello! Hi!

232
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:05,230
Oh, welcome in!

233
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,450
I'm so hungry.

234
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,280
Is it just you three?

235
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,750
Yeong Seok and Yoo Mi said they would eat at the hospital.

236
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,770
Thanks.

237
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:24,360
What should I eat today?

238
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,690
Excuse me.

239
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,440
Ah, just a SPAM call.

240
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,870
What song is this?

241
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:35,530
I don't know the title. I just downloaded it because I like it.

242
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,330
It's called Vocalise, by Rachmaninoff.

243
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,900
Do you like classical music?

244
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,020
My sister majored in music as a cellist. She went to a liberal arts school.

245
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,810
Stop spouting nonsense and just eat. I'll have your food ready soon.

246
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,080
Thank you!

247
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,860
Why did owner Kong quit her liberal art studies?

248
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,470
She said to stop talking about useless things. Eat.

249
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,420
Dr. Lee, are you not coming to eat dinner?

250
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,400
I need to head home right now.

251
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,160
I need to air my podcast live. I don't have anything recorded.

252
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,340
Oh, your podcast...

253
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,010
Did social services contact you? We have a theatrical treatment appointment scheduled for tomorrow.

254
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,390
I did.

255
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,180
If time allows after theatrical therapy, let's do our individual consultation.

256
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,900
Okay.

257
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,320
- Your food is here. 
 - Thank you.

258
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,760
Where are you going?

259
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:44,620
 There is nobody in this world who doesn't feel fear.

260
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:50,180
 We look left and right before crossing a street, and put on our seatbelt when getting into our cars.

261
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,370
 We don't leave our homes during a storm.

262
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:59,780
 We may not always be aware of it, but our fears help us maneuver through the dangers of our lives.

263
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,830
 Our fears propel us forward.

264
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,690
 The area of our brain that registers fear the earliest

265
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:10,480
 is in the place called the amygdala in our limbic system.

266
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,770
 The neurotransmitters needed to calm down the amygdala include serotonin,

267
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:19,010
 GABA, and norepinephrine.

268
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,370
 These neurotransmitters

269
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,320
 are created by a presence of something.

270
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:30,510
 Of course, that could be a person, or doing something that you enjoy.

271
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,820
 Fears can be divided into normal fears and abnormal fears.

272
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,490
 Issues arise from abnormal levels of fear and anxiety.

273
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,860
 Abnormal fear could result in a fear of objects ordinary people are not afraid of,

274
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,620
 or the act of avoiding certain situations.

275
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:53,410
 For example, those with panic disorders or external phobias that make it difficult to establish human connections.

276
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:56,580
 These are forms of sociophobias.

277
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,250
Oh, it looks like someone submitted a story.

278
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,800
"Whenever I get close to someone, I get very uneasy."

279
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,220
"I dread being abandoned."

280
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,240
"I fear that this person may become unhappy because of me."

281
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:22,550
To be honest, I also have a quite significant illness

282
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,550
in which I fear a very specific situation.

283
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:29,650
To whoever sent this story in, why don't you try resolving this with me?

284
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:30,370
Okay!

285
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:34,820
We can't live in the world as cowards because of our anxiety, right?

286
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,460
Why don't we just open our eyes wide and jump out into the open?

287
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,020
Okay!

288
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:47,780
To be honest, we are all sick.

289
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,890
We just haven't been given a diagnosis.

290
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,430
Mental illnesses

291
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,870
are not a characteristic, but a state of being.

292
00:20:54,870 --> 00:21:00,600
A state of being is something that can change depending on what situation I am placed in.

293
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,690
In other words, if your state of being improves, your sickness will go away.

294
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:10,600
That's why having a stable mind is the best remedy.

295
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,920
This has been the Soul Mechanic.

296
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,750
You're here?

297
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:00,430
I can't recognize you outside the hospital.

298
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,350
How are you feeling?

299
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:07,530
I think I've gotten a lot better. I can come outside a bit now.

300
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:13,510
Why are you sitting so far away?

301
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:17,150
I'm still kind of uncomfortable around men...

302
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,730
You're a man, too.

303
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:24,290
Sure, then. Listen from where you are.

304
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,310
Everyone is worrying about you a lot.

305
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:31,780
Kong Ji Hee even called me, out of the blue.

306
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:36,690
I think it'll be a bit difficult for you to get consultation from a male doctor,

307
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:41,710
so I'll introduce you to a female doctor. Is that okay?

308
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:45,140
I've actually been looking for one.

309
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,400
Thank you.

310
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:52,930
There's a lot going on in the hospital right now. Hurry up and come back if you don't want to feel left behind.

311
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:56,540
I'm planning on grabbing some food with the others soon.

312
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:07,160
There are a total of 6 subway operators that will get a diagnosis of their panic disorders. I'll first start with individual consultations.

313
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,120
Once those are over, Woo Jung will start with exposure therapy.

314
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,220
Yes.

315
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,880
And I've requested social services for theatrical therapy, so Se Chan, check on that.

316
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,550
How many patients will you treat in total?

317
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:19,170
The total number of patients confirmed so far is 15.

318
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,190
I am ready to take pictures!

319
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,140
What pictures?

320
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,210
The director told us that today marks a historic day for our hospital.

321
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,730
She told me to take pictures and send it to the marketing department.

322
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:30,200
She said I must get a group picture.

323
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,680
Is she crazy? They're going to reveal the patient's faces?

324
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:54,390
Operator, what do you mean you can't come, all of a sudden?

325
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:04,240
 I'm really sorry. You're putting in a lot of effort for me.

326
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:12,820
 If I go to the hospital, there isn't anyone who can take my place.

327
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,830
Sir, are you okay?

328
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:20,160
Are you sure you're okay?

329
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,420
Okay, I understand. I will call you in just a moment. Okay.

330
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,930
None of the subway operators can come today.

331
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,660
Why?

332
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,350
Dr. In!

333
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,770
Where are you going?

334
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:42,960
The transportation corporation.

335
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,690
You're going to go complain?

336
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:48,270
I went and discussed it with their employees and even set up a time to meet. Does this situation make any sense?

337
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,760
Who does this benefit?

338
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,930
Does it make sense to tell someone who experiences a panic attack every day

339
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,420
to get behind the wheel again  instead of coming to the hospital?

340
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,550
How was the operator when you just called him?

341
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,960
He had difficulty breathing. I'll be back.

342
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,170
Wait.

343
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,680
Let's go visit the patient ourselves.

344
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,770
What?

345
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:10,280
If they can't come because they don't have the time and can't find a replacement, then we can go to them.

346
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,780
I mean, we could go to the corporation and complain,

347
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,700
but since the situation is serious, we should take care of what's more urgent first.

348
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,360
Then what are you going to do there? Conduct a psychological consultation while he's driving?

349
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,850
We don't even need to do a consultation.

350
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:25,680
What they need right now is the knowledge that they are not alone.

351
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,900
Dr. In, since you're the primary doctor, you make the decision. If you tell me not to go, I won't.

352
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,430
- Im Se Chan. 
 - Yes?

353
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,880
Call the subway system's control center,

354
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:49,250
and ask them which station, and at what time, I need to get on the subway that conductor Park Jong Wook operates.

355
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,770
Yes, I will do that.

356
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:56,510
Then you go take care of what's most urgent. I'll take care of the rest.

357
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,020
Hurry up.

358
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,330
We have to get to that station within an hour.

359
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,450
Hello!

360
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,620
- You're here already? 
 - I'm a bit early, huh?

361
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,420
What should we do? There's no theatrical treatment today.

362
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,140
- Why not? 
 - I should've called you earlier.

363
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,810
I'm sorry.

364
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:31,420
A patient visit? He went to the patient himself?

365
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:35,480
Yes. I wanted to go as well, but I didn't.

366
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:40,360
Chief Park, I'm confident in treating panic disorders. I've done a lot of research in medicinal treatment.

367
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,180
Please help me treat these patients.

368
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:48,470
The thing is... we offered to do a favor for them, but they're the ones that declined.

369
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,570
Is there no way to make it so that they can't decline?

370
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:53,670
Next time, I might just take the medicine and go find them myself.

371
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:56,180
Are you turning into Lee Si Joon?

372
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,370
I have absolutely no intentions of becoming similar to Lee Si Joon,

373
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:02,960
but as far as panic disorders are concerned, I want to use Si Joon's methods.

374
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,110
The hospital director is quite upset about what happened with Congressman Koh,

375
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,520
but I'll try bringing it up to her.

376
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,330
Please help me, Chief.

377
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,910
- This is the right station, right? 
 - Yes.

378
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,850
We can get on at platform 3.

379
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,090
If we miss it, then we have to go to a different station.

380
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,590
- How much time do we have? 
 - 2 minutes.

381
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,740
Hello, how can I help you?

382
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,660
Is this operator Park Jong Wook?

383
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,580
Who is this?

384
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:32,350
I'm a psychiatrist from Eun Kang Hospital, Dr. Lee Si Joon.

385
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,760
Since you were supposed to come to the hospital today but didn't, I came to visit you.

386
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,780
Are you okay right now?

387
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,050
Is anything wrong?

388
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,920
You really came here yourself?

389
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,020
I am right next to you right now.

390
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:50,330
If you just open one door, you'll be able to see me. Don't worry about anything and drive safely.

391
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:57,030
I will go with you until the last station, and nothing will go wrong until then.

392
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:01,030
So don't worry and operate safely.

393
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,150
I'm relieved that you're crying.

394
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:20,130
I thought you might possibly have trouble breathing, but it seems you're ok.

395
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:23,300
Operator, you are not alone.

396
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,200
Please rest assured.

397
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,120
 Stay strong, operator!

398
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,280
Do you hear that?

399
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,240
Operator, you are not alone.

400
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,410
We're all traveling with you.

401
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,000
 Thank you!

402
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,160
 Please cheer up!

403
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,420
 Fighting!

404
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:09,710
Just one shift for us lasts over three hours.

405
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:15,660
But all of those three hours are spent just passing through a tunnel.

406
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:22,930
Earlier, I thought I might die, but I was able to get through it thanks to you.

407
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:28,280
It made me feel relieved just knowing that someone was next to me.

408
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,020
The other doctor who went to visit you last time probably already mentioned this,

409
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:37,130
but panic disorders can be cured with medication and a few types of training.

410
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:40,560
Please come to the hospital and get treatment.

411
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,240
We can't keep coming to you like this.

412
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,230
Yes. I'll make sure to go with my peers.
