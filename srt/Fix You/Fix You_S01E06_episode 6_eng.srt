1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,630
   

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:04,850
Have you been taking your medication?

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,690
I threw them up.

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,990
Why are you punishing yourself like that?

5
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,250
Because my mom cherishes me the most.

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,990
If something you cherish becomes ruined, it's painful.

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,510
Miss Hwang Bo Young, if you continue like this

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,690
not only will your body suffer from extreme nutrient and hormonal deficiency,

9
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,450
your brain could become damaged as well.

10
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,980
If you want to punish your mother,

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,060
what about we look for alternative methods?

12
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,270
Is there a CCTV in here?

13
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,640
No, there isn't. You can speak comfortably.

14
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,960
I...

15
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,330
Did you just sexually assault me? I can post this on social media.

16
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,390
- Miss Hwang Bo Young! 
 - Tell my mom

17
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,680
that she doesn't need to keep sending me to the hospital.

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,730
I really don't like coming here. I hate it!

19
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,950
 Sexual assault? 

20
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,700
She says she's done whatever her mother told her to do for 25 years.

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,140
What to eat, what to wear, everything. She went to the college her mother wanted her to go to.

22
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:28,800
That all built up until it exploded, in the form of self-abuse.

23
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,890
I think that patient needs psychological treatment first.

24
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,100
Endorphins increase a lot in anorexic patients.

25
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,500
They're people who are happier starving rather than eating.

26
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,550
My theory is that the lack of 'happy hormones'

27
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,870
is being revitalized in a paradoxical way through starvation.

28
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,260
That's an interesting theory.

29
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:52,300
It's a theory that can help figure out why people become addicted to starving themselves.

30
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,820
So you want to try rebalancing the hormonal levels of this patient with medication?

31
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,110
Yes, and then psychological treatment follows after.

32
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,100
I'm looking forward to it.

33
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,090
I heard the source of the pica patient's condition is due to a fear of his father?

34
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,720
I think this approach may help that patient as well.

35
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,920
I went to see my dad early this morning.

36
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,070
I realized for the first time today that his back was so small.

37
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,040
On my way back, I kept thinking,

38
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,590
"How did my dad become that way?"

39
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:36,080
"We all become weak as we grow old."

40
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,310
I wonder why I ran away so much from my father.

41
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,880
I don't know what kind of story patient Sung has,

42
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,290
but wouldn't figuring that out solve it?

43
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,680
Doctor, Sung Min Ho just cancelled his treatment session for today.

44
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,340
With whose permission?

45
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,690
The menu here is to die for; it looks really good.

46
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,450
Is it always this way?

47
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,970
Doctor,

48
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,010
why are you here?

49
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,710
Are you surprised? Seeing how you're stuttering.

50
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,250
Since you cancelled today's treatment session, I thought you must be busy, so I came here myself.

51
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:45,130
Sometimes changing the location like this is good for a change of atmosphere and can be helpful also.

52
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,820
Go ahead and eat, you must be hungry.

53
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,170
I feel good. I'm full, and the weather is nice too.

54
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,570
By the way, how tall is your dad?

55
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,820
Why?

56
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,290
I guess you don't know.

57
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,450
Then, what about his shoe size?

58
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,420
You must not be close with your dad, since you seem to know nothing about him.

59
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:15,480
Is my dad a friend that I should be friendly with him?

60
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,600
I should respect him.

61
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,650
Let's start by fixing your stammering.

62
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,300
This wasn't the first time you ate paper, is it? When was the first?

63
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:34,330
Why are you being this way to me?

64
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,580
Because I want to treat you.

65
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,370
- Why? 
- Because I'm a doctor and you're my patient.

66
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:48,140
I know how hard you tried to fix it.

67
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:53,060
You've probably been to the hospital and probably practiced  looking at the mirror every day.

68
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:58,580
You told me last time that you didn't want to chew on the house.

69
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,960
I understand that feeling.

70
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:12,410
At one point, I feared my dad the most in the world.

71
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,450
Trust in me this once.

72
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:30,240
Can y-you r-really f-fix me?

73
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,800
  Are you still angry?  

74
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,650
No. I was just about to go help you.

75
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:45,110
That's fine. You know the musical "Cinderella," right?

76
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,650
  The music director is a senior from my school. 

77
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,250
I talked about you, and he said he'd like to work with you.

78
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,680
- Really? 
- He said it's not really a big role.

79
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,370
Hey! What— How come you didn't tell me you had these kinds of connections before?

80
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,210
Thank you, I really won't forget this favor.

81
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,460

Okay, let's take a 10-minute break.

93
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,470
Thank you.

94
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:08,190
You've all improved.

95
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,700
Hello.

96
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,130
Miss Han Woo Joo, I heard about you from Ji Sun.

97
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,330
It's an ensemble, will that really be okay for you?

98
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,730
Of course. I can do whatever you tell me to do.

99
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,450
I'm sure your skills are great, judging from how you won the rookie of the year award.

100
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,600
You can practice right away, right?

101
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,750
Thank you. Thank you.

102
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,990
You should thank Ji Sun.

103
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,940
She begged me, even saying she would pay for  our team's dinner, so I said okay.

104
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,780
What?

105
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,750
You didn't know?

106
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,910
Oh you must have really not known.

107
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,960
Oh then,

108
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:53,200
you are hiring me because Ji Sun said she would buy you all a meal?

109
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,290
Well, we're just being of mutual assistance to each other.

110
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,300
Excuse me, I can't do it this way.

111
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,210
I will not do it.

112
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,440
Even though I was a national embarrassment

113
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,490
and was fired from projects,

114
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,030
it wasn't to the extent of being sold out for a free meal.

115
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,600
What do you want?

116
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,320
I just barely convinced the director.

117
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,530
Anyway, I'm not doing it.

118
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:30,470
You're failing every audition, and you still can't grasp the situation you're in?

119
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,650
I'm saying I won't do this because I do understand my situation! 
  (T/N: informal speech.) 

120
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,100
Just as the rumors said you are really a big freak.

121
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,580
Look here, do you think you're failing auditions because of drunk driving?

122
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,820
Not at all! It's because you are such a crazy b*tch!

123
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,100
- Do you know the rumors have spread in this field?! 
- Ahhhhhhh!

124
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,670
  It seemed like I was someone else.    

125
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:17,140
In the mirror,  there was someone I saw for the first time.

126
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,690
Why could I have suddenly felt that way?

127
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,740
Maybe you wanted to deny it, the Han Woo Joo you've been lately.

128
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,620
I didn't know

129
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,800
that I made people so uncomfortable.

130
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,320
When they get angry, I always apologized first.

131
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,110
Even though I did nothing wrong.

132
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,430
Then they all told me it was fine,

133
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,490
but I guess it wasn't.

134
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:51,170
No matter how small a wound, it doesn't always heal that easily.

135
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,210
I must really be a crazy b*tch.

136
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:02,550
Doctor, I'm going to leave this field for the time being.

137
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,850
Do you have plans on what you will do?

138
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,290
Someone recommended a part-time job to me.

139
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,360
What part-time job is it?

140
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,560
- What are you doing here? 
-  Oh my.

141
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,370
Perhaps are you here to meet me?

142
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,900
Yes.

143
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,700
Let's go in.

144
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,970
Have you decided?

145
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,640
On what?

146
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,480
- Didn't you come to get treatment? 
 - No.

147
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,300
Then?

148
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:55,410
I came because I was wondering if I could do the part-time job you suggested the last time.

149
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,810
You called it... theatrical treatment, right?

150
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,620
Yes, that's correct. Theatrical treatment.

151
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:05,870
I sometimes get reminded of acting in front of Mr. Cha Dong Il.

152
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,300
It strangely made me feel good.

153
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,160
I would like to do it. Can't I?

154
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,830
This works out so well.

155
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,600
I was worried. You are my savior.

156
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,920
Really? That's a relief.

157
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:55,320
These are documents on theatrical therapy. You can start immediately, right?

158
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,320
Of course.

159
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,140
What's wrong with treating their team to a few meals?

160
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,980
Are you running a charity?

161
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,500
That's your specialty.

162
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,680
Didn't you think of my pride?

163
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,210
I thought  you standing on the stage was a priority.

164
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:32,290
Pride is something you can protect once you're standing on stage.

165
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,010
I'll accept your thoughtfulness thankfully.

166
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,580
But I'm not going to look that way for the time being.

167
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,760
What are you talking about?

168
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,420
I agreed to work part-time at the hospital.

169
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,260
What work can you do part-time at a hospital?

170
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,980
Theatrical therapy.

171
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,770
What is that?

172
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:55,270
Sick people have something called "trauma" and  the job is about  finding  their trauma through theater.

173
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,630
 I'm having a really rough time. 

174
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,490
  Is this the time to be doing this here?    

175
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,750
 You've worked hard.  

176
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,370
  Well done.    

177
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,430
Hug me.

178
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:28,790
Don't say that, won't it get better on its own? 
 Be quiet and let me be! I'll live how I want!

179
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:33,310
How dare you speak to your mother that way, you little punk! Do you want to die?

180
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:13,530
You're going to college?

181
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:18,640
I told you that I can't send you to college, didn't I? I don't have the money to send you to college, also.

182
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,200
Do you think I'm made of money?

183
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,390
You're not going to some law school like your older brother.

184
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,610
If you just act a bit smarter,

185
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:34,610
you can make a living for yourself like I did, even without going to college.

186
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,240
How could someone like you go to college?

187
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,870
Hey! If I had the money to send you to college, I would rather buy your older brother an extra steak!

188
00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:00,270
Stop thinking about useless things and get a hold of yourself!

189
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:07,480
Min Ho, you have something you want to say. Don't hold it in and say it.

190
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:14,130
What kind of person is "someone like me"?

191
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:19,430
Are you asking because you don't know? Gosh, this worthless punk.

192
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:22,280
If I was able to raise you this well without your mother,

193
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,640
you should be grateful and try to live a bit more properly.

194
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,120
Is there even one thing that you can do properly?

195
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:35,290
Do you have any interest in what I'm good at?

196
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:44,760
Dad, I''m also a person.

197
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,650
I'm a person.

198
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,680
I'm also your son!

199
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,580
That's right, you're also his son. You have something you want to say to your father, right? Go on, say it.

200
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,600
Why do you only look at my brother? Why don't you see me?

201
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,380
I'm not a ghost. Stop making a fool of me like I'm not there.

202
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,850
You have to be more concrete. Your father doesn't understand you.

203
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:14,630
When I was 12, you didn't know that I ran away because I felt so lonely, did you?

204
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,230
I thought you would come looking for me.

205
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,490
After struggling out on the streets for a week,

206
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:26,430
I went back home because I couldn't stand it anymore. But you...

207
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,900
You didn't even know I ran away.

208
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,510
You just took my brother out to eat because he had come home with an award.

209
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:41,940
I was so hungry... but I had nothing to eat...

210
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:48,730
so I ate tissue papers with water.

211
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:56,500
"Let's eat this and die."  I ate it thinking that!!

212
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:24,500
 People who hurt others are typically not strangers. 

213
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:33,230
 A family member, significant other, or friend. They are those who are the closest to you.  

214
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,840
Doctor, hello.

215
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,730
Han Woo Joo, you really did well today.

216
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:58,940
I'll be heading out.

217
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:04,340
Doctor, we are going to get a drink, would you like to join us?

218
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,480
Next time.

219
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,820
Alright.

220
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,360
 There are approximately 100 billion neurons inside a person's brain. 

221
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:21,840
 The neurotransmitters that are released from these neurons influence our state of consciousness. 

222
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,200
 When we are stressed, adrenaline is released.  

223
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,470
 Oxytocin strengthens relationships with others.  

224
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,360
Thank you.

225
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,850
- Shall we do a cheers? 
 - Sounds good.

226
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,610
- Good work, everyone! 
 - Good work!

227
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:43,780
 Dopamine excites us, and GABA calms us down. 

228
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:50,060
Hello.

229
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,260
 What I wonder at this point, 

230
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:57,550
 is where these neurotransmitters come from? 

231
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,490
 They come from the mind.  

232
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,410
 But where exactly is the mind? 

233
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:08,410
 In Anglo-Saxon times, they believed the mind could be in the brain, 

234
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:12,860
in the diaphragm, or in between your ribs.

235
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:20,360
Judging from the phrase 'My heart broke', I guess they could have thought it was in the heart as well.

236
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:28,020
Greek philosophers believed that the mind was not matter, thus did not exist in the body as flesh and blood.

237
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:32,700
Thus, they said the mind did not die along with your body.

238
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,900
 I agree with the Greek philosophers.  

239
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,500
 Thus, the mind lasts forever, 

240
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,810
 and I am the fixer.  

241
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,570
I'm sorry I called you so suddenly.

242
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,560
I was thinking of calling a substitute driver but since I also have something to tell you...

243
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,490
It worked out fine, we are going in the same direction after all.

244
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,700
You know Hwang Bo Young, right? She's a patient of yours.

245
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,540
Is she someone you know?

246
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,020
She's practically family with our hospital.

247
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,430
- Oh you didn't know. 
- Yes.

248
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,630
How's the treatment going?

249
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:20,970
It seems she wasn't taking the drugs prescribed to her, so we're not seeing any effects.

250
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,630
Shouldn't anorexia first be treated psychologically, instead of with medication?

251
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,430
I am changing my approach.

252
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:31,750
Anorexia is incurable. You know that, right?

253
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,150
I know that.

254
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:38,740
I think anorexia... should be solved using Lee Si Joon's methods.

255
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,020
I'm sure you'll be able to do well yourself,

256
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:50,030
but family members always find the smallest things upsetting.

257
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:55,450
Of course I trust you. You know that, right?

258
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,150
 
 

259
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:11,770
   

260
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,290
   

261
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,080
Yes, I understand.

262
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,720
Yes.

263
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,450
Right, about the meeting of patients with eating disorders,

264
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,900
I heard there is one today.

265
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,770
Can you find out if patient Hwang Bo Young can participate in that?

266
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,170
 Yes, I'll do that. 

267
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,010
Okay.

268
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,420
What is it?

269
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:39,840
Why is he suddenly interested in theatrical therapy?

270
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,860
Let's go in.

271
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,090
Do we really have to meet my father?

272
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:09,700
You said you have something to say to him. You should tell him in person.

273
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:20,470
Psychiatry? You must be rich. Do you have money to waste?

274
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:25,710
Min Ho has something he really wants to say to you.

275
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,380
Listen.

276
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,840
If you have something to say, say it quickly, I'm busy.

277
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,440
Min Ho.

278
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:44,090
Dad, when I was 10 years old,

279
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:49,810
you woke me up during my sleep to scold me.

280
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:52,710
You asked me why I stole money from your wallet.

281
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:57,060
Even though I kept saying I didn't, you said I should not lie.

282
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,390
It really wasn't me.

283
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:02,390
I didn't steal the money.

284
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,580
You crazy punk.

285
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,370
You came all the way to say that?

286
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,710
How long ago was that?

287
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,650
Because I feel wronged.

288
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,020
That's been stuck right here,

289
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,770
all this time.

290
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,480
I say I feel wronged!

291
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,320
This pathetic punk.

292
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,870
Your brother confessed that he was the one who stole it.

293
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:29,890
Just how old are you that you're holding on to that?

294
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:32,390
That's why you are in this state.

295
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:37,030
Whether it's back then or now, just when will you become a person?

296
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,590
Doctor,

297
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:11,980
I didn't think my dad would be using things like dentures.

298
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,370
You really had no idea?

299
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,840
I couldn't even imagine.

300
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,820
All the dads in the world

301
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:27,700
slowly get smaller backs, whiter hairs,

302
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,020
and their teeth start to fall out.

303
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:35,660
Your dad is also not your dad from back then.

304
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,750
I won't tell you to understand your dad.

305
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,870
This is the beginning of the treatment.

306
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,480
Starting from finding your lost self-esteem.

307
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:05,050
Before we start to talk,  let's close our eyes for a couple seconds,

308
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:09,270
and feel the air in this space.

309
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,290
Han Woo Joo is also here.

310
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,820
She must be here to help out.

311
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,160
That's fun.

312
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,650
Alright, please open your eyes.

313
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:34,140
Everyone's face seems a shade brighter.

314
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,580
Then, shall we begin?

315
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,800
I... have anorexia nervosa.

316
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:50,590
I'm a model but  I've been cursed with a body that tends to gain weight by just drinking water.

317
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:53,940
It started out with a fear of not being able to stand on stage because of my weight,

318
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,040
but now I feel fear even when I look at food.

319
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,270
Adding weight by just drinking water is  just all crap.

320
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,290
If that were true, why would there be food scarcity in Africa?

321
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,710
They can gain weight by drinking water.

322
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,660
Thank you for sharing.

323
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,210
Next.

324
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:16,760
I'm a job seeker getting treatment for bulimia.

325
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,600
I think I must've submitted over 100 applications by now.

326
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,660
I developed a habit of overeating.

327
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,920
Once I grab my spoon, I can't put it down.

328
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,640
When I see food, I want to just put it all in my mouth and eat it.

329
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:34,160
If you don't lose weight, you'll probably be unable to get employed forever.

330
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:38,250
What are you— saying?

331
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,320
The both of you, thanks for being courageous.

332
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,080
Shall we all applaud?

333
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,200
What about you?

334
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,890
Anorexia.

335
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,530
I eat, then throw up. Eat, then throw up.

336
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:02,750
Why are you doing that?

337
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,390
My mom treats me like a doll.

338
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,400
But I'm not a doll.

339
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,240
In order to show my mother I am not her doll,

340
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,250
I just throw it all up in front of her.

341
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,890
Agonizing my mom is my goal.

342
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,180
You're really spoiled.

343
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:31,540
- What did you say?  
- You don't even know how precious that is.

344
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,490
You said agonizing your mom is your goal?

345
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:36,500
What do you know about me? I was abused!

346
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,580
That's immature of you.

347
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:42,380
- Doctor, I think they're going to fight. 
 -  There are people who live without something like that forever.  

348
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,620
Shouldn't we stop them?

349
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,690
There are tons of people in the world who float around this world like a speck of dust,

350
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:50,620
just trying to be noticed and be cared for.

351
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,050
That's why you shouldn't do anything you'll end up regretting,

352
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:57,030
and live properly with gratitude.

353
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,530
Alright, shall we all applaud now?

354
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,310
Woo Joo, are you already finished?

355
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,040
I was on my way to go take a look.

356
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:36,240
I guess I'm late. How was it today?

357
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,570
What is it, did something happen?

358
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,920
I'm sorry, I ruined it all.

359
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,920
Huh?

360
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,750
I don't think I'll be able to keep doing this. I'm sorry.

361
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,670
 There are people who have to live that way forever! 

362
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,240
Welcome.

363
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,050
Please give me one chicken.

364
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,710
Are you going to keep coming here?

365
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:45,980
I still haven't been able to find a chicken place as tasty as yours.

366
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,500
I'm someone who adopted and then ditched you.

367
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,970
Why do you keep coming here? There's nothing good to be gained from us seeing each other.

368
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:54,520
Are you doing that on purpose to make me uncomfortable?

369
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:01,170
From when I was 6 until I was 12,

370
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,010
you raised me for 6 years.

371
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,630
I want to see you sometimes, Mom.

372
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,990
Who are you calling Mom?

373
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,910
Mom,

374
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,000
about that time back then,

375
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:21,460
I'm really sorry.

376
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:26,340
Stop it. I've been so busy trying to survive, so I've forgotten things of the past.

377
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,550
Eat and leave.

378
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:19,670
♪  Would it be better just to smile and pretend I'm okay?  ♪

379
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:28,310
♪  Would that protect me from this world...  ♪

380
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:32,050
Ms. Woo Joo, what are you doing here?

381
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,240
How did you come here?

382
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:37,570
If I don't say it now, I will never be able to. That's why I came.

383
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:42,840
♫  Goodbye, the memories I want to forget  ♫

384
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,440
What you said was right.

385
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,330
I'm a patient.

386
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,870
Please treat me.

387
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,970
You can treat me, right?

388
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:03,720
♫   Will I finally be able to erase it?  ♫

389
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:10,260
♫  I'm fine. I'm so fine   ♫

390
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,750
♫  Stay by my side just like this  ♫

391
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,700
   

392
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:20,370
 Miss Woo Joo, you are someone who will change the lives of others. 

393
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,440
 Ru... Ru Oh! 

394
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,050
 Transfer Park Ru Oh to Dong Hyuk's care.  

395
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:26,020
 - He's my patient.
 - You ignore every protocol. 

396
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,810
 What's the reason you're so attached to all your patients? 

397
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,450
 Wha-What... Wait! 

398
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:32,510
 Why are you still wearing the watch I gave you? 

399
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:36,210
 What will you do if Han Woo Joo has borderline personality disorder? 

400
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,480
 Starting now, we will start the search.  

401
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,680
 You don't have any idea why they brought a search warrant? 

402
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,430
  Someone must have planned this. 

403
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:46,350
 Do you want it to be buried, scattered, or cremated?  

404
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,900
 What?
