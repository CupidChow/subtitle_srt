1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,200

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:07,360
I was a bit surprised that you contacted me directly.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:13,260
I usually go through the social welfare team, but today, I wanted to explain something to you myself.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,120
If you were surprised, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,390
Don't be sorry. I meant that I was pleasantly surprised.

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,540
It was the first time you contacted me directly.

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,220
Is that right?

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,120
What kind of patient is it this time?

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:31,280
The patient is a firefighter who suffers from PTSD, post traumatic stress disorder.

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,150
Here...

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,790
These are the relevant materials.

12
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,430

13
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,070
Oh, this fire? I remember this, too.

14
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,180
Was he at the site at the time?

15
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,810
Yes.

16
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,940
Just reading the articles brought tears to my eyes.

17
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,390
How much he must have suffered.

18
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:01,380
I've worked part-time at a trauma center before.

19
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:08,400
I saw a lot of firefighters and police officers who were suffering from PTSD at that time.

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,380
Is that right? That's great.

21
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,470
I'll try to recall that experience and work diligently to research this.

22
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,010
Han Woo Joo, your empathic ability is really outstanding.

23
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,650
- That is a good thing, right?
 - Of course.

24
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,360
So for this theatrical therapy,

25
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,430
the goal is to find out what serious injury this patient suffered during the fire.

26
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,790
I understand.

27
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,320
I will read over the materials and really make an effort.

28
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,460
Please take good care of us.

29
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,710
Dr. Lee.

30
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,350
What a good scheme.

31
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,270
What scheme?

32
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,440
Using Han Woo Joo to threaten me.

33
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,960
Huh?

34
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,200
Is she really a patient? She's great at playing around with people.

35
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,490
You met Han Woo Joo?

36
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,880
Why act like you don't know? You put her up to it.

37
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,140
You told her to come see me and say that she had no relationship with Lee Si Joon,

38
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,840
and if I don't allow the theatrical therapy, she will talk about how I'm abusing my power on SNS.

39
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,510
You told her to say those things to me.

40
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,430
I have never done that.

41
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,940
Then how would she know the Director wanted her to quit?

42
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,800
Because Han Woo Joo heard it herself.

43
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,990
Never mind, just put a stop to it. Director's orders.

44
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,370
Now, I don't even like seeing you in passing.

45
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,890
I will tell her to quit.

46
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,380
But I can't do so immediately.

47
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,310
- What?
 - It's not right to just cast someone out like this, is it?

48
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,170
Han Woo Joo also needs some time to mentally prepare.

49
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,200
So, you're going to ignore what I told you to do?

50
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,400
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,130

52
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:18,590
Oh!

53
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,880
It's cheesecake.

54
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,510
Because you like it.

55
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,310
You remembered.

56
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:29,190
Except for the fact that you love exercise, I know everything about you.

57
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:37,360
So what were you saying on the phone? You're going to do group therapy for trauma?

58
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,440
I think I will need your help.

59
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,430
What can I help you with?

60
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,300
Among your patients, if someone is suffering from a similar trauma

61
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,430
and if they are firefighters, ask them to participate, too.

62
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,270
One of my patients was a first-responder

63
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,740
during that training center incident. I'll try asking him.

64
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,190
Really? Good thing.

65
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,510
There are other patients like that in the National Trauma Center, too.

66
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:04,510
Of course it was not at the same fire site, but I'll look into whether they can participate as well.

67
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,350
Thanks.

68
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,450
Cheesecake won't be enough. Got it?

69
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,020
Of course. I'll buy you a meal, too.

70
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,950
- Drinks, too.
 - Okay.

71
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,150
And let's watch a movie, too.

72
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,560
Oh? Sure, let's do that.

73
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,700
Perhaps go on a trip, too?

74
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:38,420
Lee Si Joon, is Woo Joo special to you?

75
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,090
You aren't denying it.

76
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:48,030
From the moment I met her, she was different from others, it's true.

77
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:55,230
And all this time, I've been deceiving myself and denied it many times.

78
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,650
But I think I'm just going to accept it.

79
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:05,050
Once I made the decision, the first thing I thought of was you.

80
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:05,960
Why?

81
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:11,430
I was confused about whether I should say 'sorry' or 'thank you' to you.

82
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,890
Seeing your expression, I think the appropriate word is 'sorry.'

83
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:27,410
Actually, I had come that day intending to begin a relationship with you.

84
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,310
I guess I missed the right timing again.

85
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:39,380
Woo Joo, I've begun to see her in the office.

86
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,960
I will heal her for sure, and finally escape from my trauma, too.

87
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,770
I'll contact my patient and let you know. Drive safely.

88
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,520
Young Won.

89
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,320
We're still friends as ever, right?

90
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,970
You don't have any friends. Who else would be your friend, if not me?

91
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,940
Yesterday

92
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,380
I fought with my husband again.

93
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,930
Did he not let you drive again?

94
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,850
I'm trying not to do that

95
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:38,140
but every time he takes the driver's wheel, my heart trembles and I can't breathe.

96
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,570
Yesterday, we were on our way to a gathering

97
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:45,310
and midway there, I asked him to let me out of the car, because I couldn't stand it anymore.

98
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:50,230
Your husband overcame his trauma of being the driver in the car accident

99
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:54,290
but you have not. Why do you think that is?

100
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:59,020
Is it because my injuries were more severe?

101
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:04,160
I think the more likely reason is that you still resent your husband.

102
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,440
"The accident happened because of you." You have such thoughts, don't you?

103
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,790
To be honest, I do.

104
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:14,170
To overcome your trauma, you will have to rid yourself of those thoughts.

105
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:19,320
No, now I will detest him.

106
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,540
He's the reason I became this way,

107
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,870
but he said he can't live with me any longer and asked for a divorce.

108
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,630
- I'm sure he doesn't mean it.
 - No, he does.

109
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,110
He said it's not fun to live with me any more.

110
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,370
He says because I can't get in a car, we can't even go on a trip.

111
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,020
I'm sorry, Doctor.

112
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,570
It's alright, please don't hold back and cry.

113
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,800
If you hold back tears, it bruises your heart.

114
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,880
I've become so damaged...

115
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,210
Why do you cry, too, Doctor?

116
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,580
I'm sad with you, that's why.

117
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:24,820
Native Africans hold a large stone to their chests whenever they cross a river.

118
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,530
So they won't get swept away by the river's waters.

119
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:35,140
I think of trauma as that stone that everyone is carrying.

120
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:40,170
Someday, that stone will become a strength that supports you.

121
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:44,050
Trauma is a big life experience, after all.

122
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,780
Isn't that true?

123
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,420
- Yes?
 - Are you at Kong Rice House?

124
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,180
Yes.

125
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,690
Can I see you right now?

126
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,770
Why? I'm very busy right now.

127
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,990
Why do you keep asking to see me when I am so busy?

128
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:30,320
If I keep ditching work like this, I will get fired from Kong Rice House.

129
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,220
Did you meet with the Vice President?

130
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,270
That man, he already told on me, huh? Yes, I gave him a warning.

131
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:45,790
You threatened him, telling him not to abuse his power.

132
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,630
He told on me in such great detail.

133
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,130
Did things become difficult again for you, because of me?

134
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,250
No.

135
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,460
Vice President apologized to me and asked me to send his best wishes going forward.

136
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,780
You lie. He doesn't seem the type at all.

137
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,700
It's true.

138
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:16,170
But Woo Joo, this isn't a forever job, is it?

139
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,280
You know that it can end at any time, right?

140
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:25,610
So even if such a day comes, don't be shocked.

141
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,950
I asked to see you to tell you that.

142
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:33,650
Of course. It's not as if I was going to bury my bones in this job.

143
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:43,970
I will diligently practice my singing and look for another job.

144
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,830
Okay then. To signify our promise towards a tomorrow -

145
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,830
high-five.

146
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,030
- Wait, why aren't they coming apart? 
 - They're stuck!

147
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,520
- Why aren't they coming apart? 
 - They're stuck! It's stuck!

148
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,220
They must be stuck!

149
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,100
They don't come apart!

150
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,120
They've become totally stuck!

151
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:22,140
Ah, he's not picking up. 
 The call cannot be connected...

152
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:27,090
Seeing as he keeps not answering the phone, maybe he changed hospitals?

153
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:31,790
Even though he may not come to get treatment, we used to occasionally stay in contact.

154
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,760
Oh, it came through.

155
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,470
Yes, hello.

156
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,240
Ah, are you his wife?

157
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,900
I am the psychiatrist, No Woo Jung, from Eun Kang Medical Center.

158
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:53,110
I called because I have something to tell Seo Ban Kang, has he gone somewhere?

159
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,610
Sorry?

160
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,640
What does that mea—

161
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,100
Sunbae?

162
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,630
They say he died... a month ago.

163
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,230
What?

164
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:30,090

(T/N: TV show.)

165
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,580
Hello!

166
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,790
You didn't sleep well again yesterday?

167
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,180
Your face looks so ashen.

168
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:01,170
My ears were ringing all night so I couldn't sleep.

169
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,400
Then from today, we'll try changing your medicine.

170
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,720
Yes, doctor.

171
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,640
Soo In, you're getting discharged today, right?

172
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,170
- Are you going to go to school now? 
 -Yes.

173
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,100
You can't come again saying you miss me.

174
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,800
Yes.

175
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,010
Are you uncomfortable anywhere?

176
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,560
But, you seem to be sweating a lot. Since when have you been like this?

177
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,720
I was like this all night.

178
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,980
You must not be feeling very well. I'll prescribe you some medicine,

179
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,550
and if there's anything you want to eat let me know.

180
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,800
I'll buy it for you.

181
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:48,320
What should we do about the patient that can't fall asleep because of her tinnitus?

182
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,290
I don't think it'll be resolved by just changing her medicine.

183
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,530
We've already changed her medicine many times.

184
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:55,490
Bring the recorded list of medicines that she has taken so far,

185
00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:00,310
and about that patient that was sweating a lot during the night...

186
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,280
What are you doing?

187
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,170
I'm sorry.

188
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:10,680
Did you know the patient, Jung Hoon Yi, was sweating all night?

189
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,670
- I didn't know. 
 - Why wouldn't you know? She's your patient.

190
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:19,090
It seems like she couldn't sleep either. Decrease the SSRI in her medication, and combine it with anxiolytic drugs.

191
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,650
Keep watch over her for a day and if she doesn't seem to be getting better change her prescription.

192
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,520
Understood.

193
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,320
Doctor.

194
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,270
- Yes? 
 - I have something to tell you.

195
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,440
What is it?

196
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,070
About Woo Jung sunbae...

197
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,260
Why is your face so swollen?

198
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,970
I couldn't sleep last night. I pulled an all-nighter.

199
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,890
What were you doing that you stayed up all night?

200
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:07,290
I wrote a script.

201
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:11,550
Please don't ask me to show it to you, since I won't show you yet.

202
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,960
Why did you suddenly write a script?

203
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:20,210
Because, after watching a documentary, there's something that I remembered.

204
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:26,650
About 5 years ago, I had a job dealing with a PTSD patient's condition.

205
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:32,390
I really lived forgetting about it, but last night I suddenly started thinking about it.

206
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:35,060
So, I wrote a script about my experience during that time.

207
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,490
- What kind of job was it?
- Giving hugs.

208
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,320
Hugs?

209
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,850
Yes.

210
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:47,570
It was a part-time job hugging bereaved family members who had lost someone in an accident.

211
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:51,180
Everyone thought of me as the daughter who passed away,

212
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,050
and they all cried a lot.

213
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,120
I also hugged them like I had become their real daughter.

214
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,470
Later on, even on days I wasn't working I went and hugged them.

215
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,220
That's a great part-time job.

216
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,300
What about you, Doctor?

217
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,410
You said you had a trauma too.

218
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,750
Have you never done something like that?

219
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:24,800
There's something called a safety zone when treating a trauma.

220
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,340
If you think of a painful memory, or when you remember anything unfortunate,

221
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:34,740
you find stability in your favorite place, or by remembering things you liked to do.

222
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:40,010
The thing that you provided for those people, is basically like that.

223
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,690
You became their daughter.

224
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,010
Will you stand up for a second?

225
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,640
- Why? 
 - Quickly.

226
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,500
I thought you might need this too.

227
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,870
You're only just coming now?

228
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,280
Oh you were home?

229
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,580
How are you drunk every day?

230
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,610
I'm sorry.

231
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:24,400
You call yourself a doctor, and you're doing this because one patient died?

232
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,460
You're so weak.

233
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,490
If you're going to show me something like this, don't even bother coming home.

234
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,650
- Dad. 
 - What?

235
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,500
Just.

236
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:43,550
Can't you just console me?

237
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,990
Why are you so stiff?

238
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,660
Console?

239
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,060
Do you want me to give you a hug?

240
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:55,120
Yes. Hug me please.

241
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,260
I need something like that.

242
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,300
This pitiful fool. Really.

243
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,360
Doctor, why are we here?

244
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,110
Let's run a bit.

245
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,330
Suddenly, running?

246
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,610
If you run, you produce adrenaline.

247
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:28,590
There's nothing like running in overcoming trauma.

248
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:31,250
It helps you sleep, too.

249
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,980
Seeing your condition, you didn't sleep a wink yesterday did you?

250
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,580
- Right. 5 laps of the field. 
 - 5 laps?

251
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,960
If you can't beat me, it'll be difficult to become a doctor.

252
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,580
That's not fair.

253
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,810
It's up to me.

254
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,020
Right, get ready!

255
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,270
Doctor! That's cheating.

256
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,370
No!

257
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:29,190
He texted me about a month and a half ago.

258
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:35,650
I thought something was off then, but I just ignored it.

259
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:41,910
Now that I think about it, I think he was asking me to save him.

260
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,380
I couldn't protect him.

261
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,500
Are you some hero from a Marvel movie?

262
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:56,220
But I'm a psychiatrist.

263
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:02,240
Do you think psychiatrists are incredible people? We're not actually all that great.

264
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:09,840
We can make mistakes and fall into despair more easily than others.

265
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,810
We're just people, like everyone else.

266
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,270
I know that, too.

267
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,150
Do you really know it?

268
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:24,130
I think of psychiatrists as lookouts.

269
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:27,210
They silently watch over people in precarious situations.

270
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,300
You know very well.

271
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,140
That's good.

272
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,480
Amazing. This is really touching!

273
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,310
Is it really okay?

274
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:58,070
How did you come up with something like this?

275
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,610
From my part-time work experience.

276
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,290
Did you show Dr. Lee yet?

277
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:05,520
Not yet. The theatrical treatment patient for this one is Dr. In's patient.

278
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,510
Dr. Lee probably has a PTSD patient, too.

279
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:11,540
This isn't the final product yet. I'm going to edit it a bit more.

280
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,010
You're so cool.

281
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,980
Wow, it's the Chief.

282
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,530
Hello?

283
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:27,540
Why are you calling at this time?

284
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,550
Yes?

285
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:36,930
I am just... not really understanding right now.

286
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,620
What are you talking about?

287
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,810
I'll listen to what you have to say in person. Where are you?

288
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,200
I can't wait until tomorrow.

289
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,640
Maybe you're aware that this is something to get upset over?

290
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,950
Wait a minute. Don't hang up and—

291
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:58,420
Hello? Hello—

292
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,410
What's wrong?

293
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,560
One...

294
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,350
Two... Three...

295
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,350
Did they say to quit?

296
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,490
Han Woo Joo, let go!

297
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,440
Let go!

298
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,920
You're trying to call Dr. Lee right? You can't call him when you're like this.

299
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,500
- I just got fired. 
 - I know.

300
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,860
- I know but even if you're going to complain, do it tomorrow. 
  - How can I wait until tomorrow?

301
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,260
Even for a part-timer, isn't this too much?

302
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,910
I worked so hard!

303
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,730
Give me my phone. Give it!

304
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:47,430
Han Woo Joo! I can guarantee that Dr. Lee doesn't know a thing about this.

305
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:51,830
Think about it carefully. Who do you think did this?

306
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,190
The Vice President.

307
00:25:55,190 --> 00:26:00,080
Exactly. Then what happens if you tell Dr. Lee right now? You're just going to start an argument.

308
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,250
Let it go for today, and talk over it with that Vice President quietly tomorrow.

309
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:08,180
Even if you're going to be angry, take it out on the Vice President!

310
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,630
I thought you liked Dr. Lee.

311
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:15,120
You want to stay on good terms with him.

312
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,430

313
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:47,260
The fire fighters who are here today have all experienced similar things.

314
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,620
Can everyone share their stories?

315
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,760
Would you like to go first?

316
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:01,210
I went on a lot of fire suppression missions.

317
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:04,940
One day, I started being scared of fires.

318
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,730
These days, when I don't have water next to me, I feel anixous.

319
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:12,070
I usually have to carry around a few large bottles of water in my bag.

320
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,380
I have trauma related to fire as well.

321
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:19,730
Of course gas-lit fires were no joke, but I couldn't even light a candle on fire before. Now I've gotten a bit better.

322
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,940
I still can't look at the color red though.

323
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:26,650
My kimchi-fridge at home is red, but every time I look at it I have trouble breathing.

324
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:29,330
So I threw it out without my wife knowing.

325
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:31,950
Do you have a good relationship with your wife?

326
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,180
We almost got a divorce because of that.

327
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:43,460
I... experienced flashbacks for some time.

328
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:47,120
I kept seeing dead people right before my eyes.

329
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,740
At first, I was really surprised by it, but I've gotten better thanks to treatment.

330
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:56,940
In case anyone may be experiencing something similar right now, I hope you're not worrying too much.

331
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,830
Firefighter Baek, you have a similar experience, right?

332
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,080
Not at all.

333
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:06,680
I see ghosts. Ghosts of dead children.

334
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,020
He just said it was something called flashbacks.

335
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,940
Who are you to act like you know what I'm talking about?

336
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,940
By the way, you two were at the same incident.

337
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:23,450
You were on the fire-suppression team, and you, the rescue team.

338
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,840
How are you these days?

339
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,910
I'm...

340
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:36,020
getting better, thanks to consultations with my doctor.

341
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,720
I think things like this help a lot, too.

342
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,690
It's nice.

343
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,390
Then, can we hear a bit more about your experiences?

344
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:53,310
You can talk about anything.

345
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,140
On that day...

346
00:28:56,590 --> 00:29:00,720
I ran into the training center, but the door wouldn't open.

347
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:07,810
I just barely managed to break the door down and went inside, but the children were dead right at the door.

348
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:14,840
Not one person was alive inside.

349
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,810
You should just forget about it. It's unfortunate the kids died, but what can you do about it?

350
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:22,810
If you're a firefighter, you should treat it as something you're bound to experience and just forget about it.

351
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:24,850
What else can you do?

352
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:27,840
It's not like those dead kids will come back to life.

353
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,890
It's because of you!

354
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:35,880
If you had come just a little earlier, they wouldn't have died!

355
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,750
Hit me! Hit me again!

356
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,560
Why is he acting like that?

357
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,810
Dr. In!

358
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,900
Dr. In!

359
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,620
Dong Hyuk, today's the first day.

360
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,200
I'm sure he'll get better.

361
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,400
Isn't it true that not all traumas can be fixed with time?

362
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,170
Well, of course that's true, but—

363
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:23,750
Group treatment was never the correct way to treat that patient.

364
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,330
He's my patient. I'll make the decisions for my patients.

365
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:34,140
Okay. I should've had more discretion. I'm sorry.

366
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:39,870
I thought that if people of similar experiences met together, treatment would be more effective.

367
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:44,030
How can you always be so full of confidence?

368
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:49,050
You always think you only speak the truth, that you're always correct, and that you can solve everything.

369
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:52,390
Why are you being like this? I'm saying I was wrong. I'm sorry.

370
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,300
This is a superiority complex.

371
00:30:54,300 --> 00:31:02,650
It's a privilege that only people who have never had to chase behind others have.

372
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,810
Hello?

373
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:25,070
What?

374
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:30,360
The Chief revoked Ms. Han Woo Joo's contract?

375
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,760
Where is Ms. Han Woo Joo right now?

376
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,120
Please just get up! Why are you torturing me like this?

377
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,980
Vice President, I was wrong last time.

378
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,600
Please reconsider it one more time.

379
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,010
I was wrong to nitpick at things to someone superior to me.

380
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:55,250
I really regret my actions.

381
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,850
Goodness, I'm going crazy.

382
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:59,090
I'm telling you I didn't do it!

383
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,680
Please, Vice President.

384
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,420
- Get up. 
 - Wait.

385
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,720
What are you doing here?

386
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,510
The Vice President fired me, so I'm asking for forgiveness.

387
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,410
I'm telling you it wasn't me!

388
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:25,570
- Let's go.
 - I can't leave before I hear his response.

389
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:28,340
- Wait! 
 - Are you two dating?

390
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:38,960
You two are dating, right?

391
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,310
Yes. You're right.

392
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,160
So what?

393
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:49,850

394
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:52,560

395
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,840
♫  The endlessly dark evening road  is narrow and far  ♫

396
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,660

397
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:01,470
 Can't you love someone normal?

398
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,520
 Does Woo Joo suit Dr. Lee?

399
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,610
 Why are you the only one like this, when so many firefighters were at the scene that day?

400
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,800
 Isn't it fine for someone to be a bit late?

401
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,610
 Is that more important than a promised consultation?

402
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:12,940
 I suddenly feel uneasy.

403
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,850
 Ms. Woo Joo sent me pictures of self harm.

404
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:18,430
 Did you say you were going to meet a BPD patient without bracing yourself for even this much?

405
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:21,960
 Are you being like this because you want to see me die?

406
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,270
♫   I love you   ♫
