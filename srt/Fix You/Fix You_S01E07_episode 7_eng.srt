1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,390

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:10,820

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,570
Miss Woo Joo?

4
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,400
How did you—

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,430
How did you know to come here?

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,200
I came because I thought I couldn't ever say it if I didn't say it now.

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,890
You were right, doctor.

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,680
I'm a patient.

9
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,690
Please treat me.

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,900
You can treat me, right?

11
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,770
I... have no family,

12
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,750
and Gong Ji Sun is my only friend.

13
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,540
I've never ended on good terms with people I've met on stage.

14
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,100
They all disliked me because I'm a fighter.

15
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,500
In order to try to get along with others,

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,090
I've always been wary of them and given them everything I could.

17
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,980
It makes sense... that my boyfriend cheated on me.

18
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:17,570
Right? Who would like someone like me?

19
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,490
You told me that once I acknowledge that I'm sick, I can get treatment.

20
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,720
- Miss Woo Joo... 
 - Yes?

21
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,940
I'm really hungry. Can we get some food first?

22
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,350
 Can you really eat in this situation?

23
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:57,070
I didn't know you did a podcast.

24
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,040
But, what kind of scar is that?

25
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,700
There, on your wrist.

26
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,740
Oh, this?

27
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,050
It was just out of curiosity.

28
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,360
- Did you want to die? 
 - No.

29
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,250
I've never thought that I wanted to die.

30
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,950
I've actually always wanted to survive.

31
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,480
Even when I was tired to death of failing all my auditions,

32
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,650
I've always wanted to live,

33
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,420
getting love and attention from others.

34
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,060
This was also... another way I tried to get some attention.

35
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:44,060
It wasn't even with a knife. I was scared it would hurt, so I used a ruler. A plastic ruler.

36
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,700
It ended up scarring because the ruler broke...

37
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,020
Why did you want attention?

38
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,630
Isn't everyone like that? Don't you want attention?

39
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,600
I don't. I really don't like it when people pay attention to me.

40
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,340
How full of yourself...

41
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,380
Do you remember Cha Dong Il?

42
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,720
How could I forget that fake cop?

43
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,580
These days, he's working so hard to prepare for the police exam.

44
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,760
Even if it rains or snows, he goes to the library daily.

45
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,770
Goodness... Isn't that so surprising?

46
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,750
So what? What does that have to do with me?

47
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,040
Why wouldn't it have something to do with you?

48
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,100
Someone's life was changed because of you.

49
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,110
Because of me? Yeah, right!

50
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,290
Sung Min Ho, who was suffering from anxiety,

51
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:26,030
was able to say everything he's been keeping to himself for all these years because of you.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,130
You are not someone who deserves to be cheated on by their boyfriend.

53
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,450
You're someone who changes the lives of others.

54
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:45,100
There are no conditions that lack a source. There's a reason you must have become a fighter.

55
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,110
Now, shall we?

56
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,790
All of a sudden?

57
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,660
Today marks day 1.

58
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,830
I'm your primary physician, and you are my patient.

59
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,810
You can't be the kind of bad doctor that quits halfway because it gets difficult, okay?

60
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,870
Listen to what I say and don't even think of running away.

61
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,420
Okay.

62
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,780
Boop!

63
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,800
Let's see...

64
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,030
 For the time being, the weather will be clear.

65
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,590
 That concludes the weather forecast.

66
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,400
 Today was yet another eventful day.

67
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,860
 In times like this, it's good to take a break and go

68
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,290
 look at the cherry blossoms with your loved one.

69
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,640
Cherry blossoms? Yeah, right!

70
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,940
 I'm Hwang Min Wook.

71
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,950
Wait a minute. Why is he still wearing the watch that I gave him?

72
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,250
- Hello? 
 - It's been a while.

73
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,110
Give me back the watch. You don't deserve to wear that watch.

74
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,400
I bet you don't even know what kind of watch that is.

75
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,970
That watch doesn't belong on the wrist of a bastard like you!

76
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,330
What?

77
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,670
In a package? Do you really want to die?

78
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:01,200
Forget it. I'm going to get it right now, so you wait right there.

79
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,640
The watch... Goodness!

80
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,280
 That watch doesn't belong on the wrist of a bastard like you!

81
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,970
  Do you really want to die?

82
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,620
What have I done this time?

83
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,930
You pathetic psycho.

84
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,350
Why are you like this?

85
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,800
 Did you want to die?

86
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,450
 No. I've never thought that I wanted to die.

87
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,230
 I've actually always wanted to survive.

88
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,790
 What makes her want to live so badly?

89
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,310

90
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,920
Just let him be for now. Don't take your eyes off him.

91
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,370
New York, Paris, Tokyo, anywhere everyone's going!

92
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:44,280
New York, Paris, Tokyo, anywhere everyone's going!

93
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,030
Anywhere! Anywhere everyone's going!

94
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:52,480
Go, go, go, go! Go!

95
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,960
Go! Go!

96
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,250
 Anywhere everyone's going. Everyone's going.

97
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,980
Are you just going to keep watching him like that?

98
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,520
 Tokyo. Anywhere everyone's going.

99
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,370
His current medication doesn't seem to be working.

100
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,840
I think you should give him a different drug with greater sedating effects.

101
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,760
 Anywhere everyone's going.

102
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,560
If you give the order, I will move immediately.

103
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,460
Please wait a moment.

104
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,500
Dr. Lee is on his way.

105
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,160
If all the other patients wake up because of him, we'll be in bigger trouble.

106
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,210
 Anywhere, everyone's going.

107
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,000
Ru Oh's symptoms are getting worse.

108
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,420
Eventually, he won't eat or sleep,

109
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,770
and just lay there like a dead person.

110
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:39,240
When Doctor Lee gets here, I'll let you know.

111
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,960
Dr. Lee.

112
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,240
 Anywhere where everyone's going.

113
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,490
His visual hallucinations have gotten worse.

114
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,900
Should we increase his dosage?

115
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,770
Dr. Oh suggested we could change to a heavier sedative—

116
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,720
You said his condition got worse. Why would we increase his dosage if it got worse?

117
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,730
Dr. Lee, he has to sleep.

118
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:08,560
He's been like this anytime he eats. It's hard for us and the patient.

119
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,500
His ability to recognize faces has decreased tremendously as well.

120
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,430
I'm going to take Ru Oh on a walk.

121
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,340
What? At this hour?

122
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,420
Dr. Lee...

123
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,860
You can't take him on a walk.

124
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,440
Per the hospital's rules, night walks with patients are prohibited.

125
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,430
I'll stick right next to him.

126
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,240
If you let him take a walk now, his sleep cycle will be affected as well.

127
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,920
- New York, Paris, Tokyo. Anywhere where everyone's going. 
 - Park Ru Oh?

128
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,280
Shall we go on a walk?

129
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,240
Ru Oh seems to be in a better mood now.

130
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,570
It must've been stuffy in his ward.

131
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,840
He first started having hallucinations

132
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,790
in the student dormitory he lived in after he came to Korea. 
 (T/N: Affordable, but very cramped, rooms for students.)

133
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:59,500
His symptoms may have gotten worse because his hospital ward is small.

134
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,680
That's why you suggested... a walk.

135
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,870
I wonder how the mind of a 15 year-old became so complicated.

136
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,760
But Doctor... is it okay to break the rules like this?

137
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,160
Dr. Oh seemed really angry.

138
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,530
That's why I suggested we take a walk.

139
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,610
What?

140
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,180
Whenever she sees me, she just spits poison, so I ran away.

141
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,860
Ru-Ru Oh!

142
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,270
Hey, Ru Oh!

143
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,260
Ru Oh! Where are you going?

144
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,640
Ru Oh!

145
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,510
If I catch you, you're in trouble!

146
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,380
Ru Oh, be careful!

147
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,030
Ru Oh, where are you going?

148
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,020
Hey, watch the stairs! They're dangerous!

149
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,030
You're going to get hurt!

150
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,600
Gosh, he's so fast.

151
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,560
Ru Oh!

152
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,690
 Symptoms getting worse.

153
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:56,040
 Visual hallucinations getting worse, facial recognition...

154
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:03,260
The mental health center seems like it will open sooner than we expected.

155
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,240
Really?

156
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:12,330
Dr. In, be honest. Who do you think will be the center's first director?

157
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,730
Can I really be honest?

158
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,730
Of course.

159
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:24,130
I think... Chief Park will take that position.

160
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,400
Aren't you being a little too honest?

161
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,490
I personally hope you will take the position because

162
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:34,520
I want the new mental health center to use your treatment methods.

163
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:39,780
Of course, this is because I'm following in your footsteps as well.

164
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,030
Are you being sincere?

165
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:44,380
You know how honest I was just now.

166
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,300
Then I think you'll need to help me a bit.

167
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,900
With what should I help you?

168
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:55,060
Find Lee Si Joon's weakness. Something that will deter Chief Park.

169
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,090
Did you know that Chief Park and the President of the hospital went to the same school?

170
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,640
I didn't know that.

171
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,570
I'm not trying to become the center's director because I want the position.

172
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:17,060
I'm a doctor too. I have the patient's interest in mind, just like anyone else.

173
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:21,860
The center will fail if it takes after the approach of Chief Park and Lee Si Joon.

174
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,900
People seem to not know this, but mental illnesses are infectious.

175
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,330
Just look at how many patients have panic attacks these days.

176
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:35,810
The number will only increase from here. Using Lee Si Joon's methods? There's no chance.

177
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,620
Will you help me?

178
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,600
Well, sure. I'll help you,

179
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,210
for the mental health center.

180
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:53,810
Alright. Let's work hard for the mental health of this country.

181
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:23,650
I understand. I'll make sure I have a word with Dr. Lee.

182
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:29,070
Now that I've told you this, I actually feel a little uneasy.

183
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:33,750
I know that Dr. Lee cares for his patients more than anyone,

184
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,660
but we need to survive as well.

185
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:39,740
Patients need to sleep at night, but he never sleeps.

186
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,350
I understand.

187
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:48,970
At this rate, the nurses in this ward may leave in protest.

188
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,680
To be honest, in cases as extreme as patient Park,

189
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,570
it's better for the patient as well to put him to sleep, even if that means forcing him to take the sedatives.

190
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:00,610
He's on the brink of entering a vegetative state. I think giving him strong sedati—

191
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:05,760
Doctor. You've said enough.

192
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,150
The primary physician will decide what specific drug to prescribe the patient.

193
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:15,990
I've crossed the line. I apologize.

194
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,030
I'll be leaving now.

195
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,970
Ru Oh's mother.

196
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,500
You want to discharge Ru Oh?

197
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,890
It's time for us to return to Vietnam.

198
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:48,210
If he just finishes one more semester there, he can attend college there as a foreign exchange student.

199
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,140
It's the reason we've stayed there this long.

200
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:53,740
It would be such a loss to just give up like this.

201
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,640
Ru Oh cannot be discharged from the hospital.

202
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,180
Why can't I discharge my child from the hospital when I'd like?

203
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,280
He's gotten worse.

204
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,310
Why?

205
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,710
We'll look into the source of that from here on out.

206
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:11,660
What am I supposed to think if he's only gotten worse after being here for three months?

207
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:18,870
Three months is nothing compared to the time he spent in isolation.

208
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:25,340
Are you suggesting this all happened because I left my son in isolation?

209
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,150
Do you think I wanted to make my child live in a tiny student dormitory?

210
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,230
My child left school and was being called a returnee—

211
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,500

212
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,880
without my knowledge.

213
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:41,460
I mean to say that, as a doctor, I need more time to fully treat Ru Oh.

214
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:46,900
Are you confident that you can fix my son?

215
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,970
I'm asking you if you're confident.

 I don't have confidence.

238
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,930
 I can't fix a patient with just confidence.

239
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:24,810

Today, I will be reading your submitted stories and responding to them.

240
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:28,260
There are stories being submitted as we speak.

241
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,140
This is one that just popped up.

242
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:36,040
"I don't know when it started, but someone whispers in my ear every day."

243
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:42,210
"The thing that's crazy about this is that I know it's a hallucination, but I still do as they tell me."

244
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:45,870
"I am on Seogang Bridge right now."

245
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,370
"Right now, it's telling me to jump in front of a car."

246
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:53,170
"Soul Mechanic, please stop me."

247
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,750
Hey, hey! Hey!

248
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,500
Hey!

249
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,350
Hey, you!

250
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:17,130
 Ru Oh, unlike other patients with schizophrenia, knows that he is hallucinating.

251
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,840
 He also knows he is sick.

252
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,550
 He also knows that he must take medication.

253
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:28,240
 The problem is that his body rejects the medication.

254
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,880
 All complications arise.

255
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,300
 Then, there is only one answer.

256
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,360
Dr. Lee!

257
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,370
Doctor, what should I do? I caused big trouble yesterday.

258
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,560
What kind of trouble?

259
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:49,710
I couldn't see anything else then. I could only see the watch.

260
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:55,020
I could only think that watch is something that person shouldn't be wearing.

261
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,920
So you called him right away and asked for it back?

262
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:04,820
I learned for the first time that a person could be as petty as this.

263
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:10,320
Because of that, my rising self-confidence hit rock bottom,

264
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,270
and I even feel kind of depressed.

265
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:16,370
- Was it expensive? 
 - Yes. Incredibly.

266
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:19,860
I bought it for him to celebrate my first leading role.

267
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,030
Now that I think about it, it's kind of pathetic.

268
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,370
Why would I buy him a watch in celebration of me landing the leading role?

269
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:28,440
I should be the one receiving congratulations.

270
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:36,700
After I bought that for him, I was broke and walked around looking like a beggar.

271
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,710
I was suddenly so upset by that thought.

272
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:42,890
I suffered like that to buy someone like him a nice watch?

273
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,490
You did very well.

274
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:48,990
- What? 
 - Go get that watch back.

275
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,720
If you're upset at something, you should resolve it.

276
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,680
That's true, but... this is seriously petty.

277
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,920
Dating always ends in pettiness.

278
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,470
Make sure you get that watch, okay?

279
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:02,190
- Really? 
 - Call me once you get it back.

280
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:09,410

281
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:17,430
What do you think? Is it to your liking?

282
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,760
The facilities are not the main issue right now.

283
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:25,960
It's the first mental health center in Korea being opened by a university hospital.

284
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,850
To be honest, I am very excited.

285
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,300
What are you the most excited about?

286
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,170
I'm excited that there will be so many more hospital rooms available for patients.

287
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:42,710
I'm also excited for the trauma center and the establishment of the suicide prevention help line.

288
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,800
I'm excited for all of it.

289
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,490
Korea is a country with many wounds.

290
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:54,110
You know I was at the site of 9/11 in America?

291
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,230
Yes, of course.

292
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:02,220
At the time, the biggest concern of the U.S. government was establishing a trauma center.

293
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:07,580
The survivors as well as the family members of individuals who didn't survive the incident all got treatment.

294
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:12,880
I also received a lot of help from that center as well.

295
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:17,400
But then I realized Korea didn't have a place like that.

296
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,440
Our bridges fall, passenger boats sink, and the subways collapse.

297
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,980
There are big accidents happening all over the country,

298
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:32,620
but they want us to just endure it. Forget about it. Does that make sense?

299
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:39,530
This place has many wounds, but not enough healing.

300
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:42,400
That must be your reason.

301
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,830
The reason you want to establish the mental health center.

302
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,900
Chief Park, you're still...

303
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,900
quite naive, as you've always been.

304
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,670
Am I?

305
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,370
Hello?

306
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,840
Yes, thank you for letting me know.

307
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,710
Let's meet up soon, okay?

308
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:18,160
They say an investigation team is coming with a search warrant.

309
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:23,540
- To our department? 
 - Someone must have made a report to the National Human Rights Institution.

310
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,590
They said there was a case of violence in the hospital wards.

311
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,190
What's that?

312
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,630
I'll head in first.

313
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,970
We're the investigation team from the Seoul Metropolitan Police.

314
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,360
What?

315
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:02,590
We will be conducting a search and seizure investigation.

316
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,840
A sei—

317
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,950
For what reason?

318
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,460
Someone reported that a patient was forcefully admitted into an asylum and treated with violence.

319
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,270
We'll be taking materials from February 1st of last year

320
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:19,270
pertaining to the patient's records and any relevant CCTV material.

321
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,640
Please begin.

322
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,710
We object to the search.

323
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,710
A doctor has a responsibility to protect the records of their patient.

324
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,590
Doctor Lee.

325
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,830
If you continue acting like this, you could be arrested for noncompliance.

326
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,830
A report has already been made to the National Human Rights Institution.

327
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:50,680
Are you not aware that you must comply no matter what to reports made to the National Institution?

328
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:55,330
Are you not aware that doctors must protect no matter what the personal information of their patients?

329
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,970
What are you doing?

330
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,000
Comply to the search.

331
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,710
Chief.

332
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,630
It's about patient Park Ru Oh.

333
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:15,500
- What? 
 - There was concrete evidence filed to the Human Rights Institution.

334
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,450
Let them conduct the search.

335
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,490
Please go ahead.

336
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:27,690

337
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,290
Please only take items that are explicitly granted to you in the search warrant.

338
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:43,370
Sure, sure. We don't need other materials anyways.

339
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,090
Where are the CCTV record kept in this hospital?

340
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,270
Can't you hear me?

341
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:55,210
They're stored in the administrative offices.

342
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:02,600
Do you really have no idea why this happened? The search and seizure.

343
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:18,550
What's going on?

344
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,840
I'm so worried.

345
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,950
You know, right? The reason the search warrant came out?

346
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:31,450
When Ru Oh first came to the hospital, we couldn't get into contact with his guardians.

347
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,450
It had passed the three-day window where we could admit him as an emergency case.

348
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:36,330
So?

349
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,350
So I forcefully admitted him, without the consent of a guardian.

350
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,840
I think that became a problem.

351
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,800
 You have to come back with your mother.

352
00:27:54,800 --> 00:28:00,030
 You need more treatment, but we're letting you go because we don't have consent from your guardians.

353
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:03,830
 - You have to come back, okay? 
 - Thank you.

354
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,480
 Ru Oh, you don't have to leave.

355
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,040
 Doctor...

356
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,970
 I got in contact with his guardian. They're getting on a plane from Vietnam right away.

357
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:15,740
 Don't we still need to let him go for now?

358
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,400
 Let him leave, and then readmit him.

359
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,040
 How could you send him back to that tiny student dorm in this condition?

360
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,600
 He's still suffering from visual hallucinations.

361
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,330
 Forget it. An extra day won't hurt.

362
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:35,050
But to be honest, it wasn't just one day.

363
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:38,500
I remember, the guardian came after a week had passed.

364
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,220
So you knew about all of that even then.

365
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,400
He's a 15-year-old schizophrenia patient.

366
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:51,150
He was showing signs of hallucinatory behavior. I saw him run in front of a car with my own eyes. How could I let him leave?

367
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,880
You must be getting a lot of resentment from others.

368
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,780
What does that mean?

369
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,490
To you, that was the right thing to do. But others must have been uncomfortable about it.

370
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:10,530
Why else would they anonymously file a complaint now for something that happened three months ago?

371
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:13,950
Well, if that's the case, there are multiple people like that.

372
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,940
Can you joke in a situation like this?

373
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,590
In this situation, I kind of wish I could drink right now.

374
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:22,930
Come out after you've resolved everything then.

375
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,760
Are you letting me drink with you tonight?

376
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,350
I don't know.

377
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,210
What are you going to buy me? Huh?

378
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,240
What are you going to buy me?

379
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,630
Goodness...

380
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:38,290
You ordered a good one.

381
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:45,940
I thought search and seize investigations were only done in cases of illegal possessions or  fraud.

382
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,870
Me too. I didn't think that a psychiatrist could receive a search and seizure order.

383
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:53,860
It happens more often than you guys may think.

384
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,940
Who would have filed a report to the Human Rights Institute?

385
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,640
Was it the guardian? Usually it's the guardian that does things like this.

386
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:04,900
Guardians don't usually file a complaint. They would just sue the hospital.

387
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:11,400
The fact that they made a public report means that they wanted to protect themselves with the anonymity.

388
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:15,930
Don't you think someone could have done this intentionally?

389
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:20,070
There's a famous phrase you can use at times like these.

390
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,140
The culprit is closer than you think.

391
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,310
- So who? 
 - Doctor In.

392
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,040
- Goodness. 
 - I'm sorry. Bad joke.

393
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:34,830
If you file a public complaint, the investigation commences right away. They may have been after that.

394
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:38,160
It means someone genuinely thought there was some issue.

395
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,510
The nurses in the wards did have lots of complaints.

396
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:44,740
I heard the nurses whispering amongst themselves a lot, too.

397
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:49,440
They were complaining that the patients wouldn't sleep because Dr. Lee wouldn't prescribe his patients sedatives.

398
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:55,380
You all should think about whether you might have even accidentally done anything wrong to patient Park Ru Oh.

399
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,570
Another investigation could come out soon.

400
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:00,610
Yes.

401
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:06,160
So who would report something like this?

402
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,030
Since it's a public report, there's no way for us to find out.

403
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:11,750
I mean, do things like this happen often?

404
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:15,800
Once in a while? It happens at other hospitals too.

405
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:22,970
I think it's been 2 years? One patient sued us as soon as they were discharged from the hospital, claiming they were assaulted.

406
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:27,100
Thanks to the surveillance cameras, it was revealed that was a lie.

407
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:32,400
Woo Joo, don't worry. Dr. Lee watched over Ru Oh with so much care.

408
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:37,110
He didn't even prescribe Ru Oh any medication, because his body rejected all of it.

409
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:41,460
Well, I guess the nurses had to suffer every night because of that.

410
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,680
Someone definitely planned this out.

411
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,540
They're trying to find flaws in Dr. Lee.

412
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,210
I'm going to find out who made the report.
