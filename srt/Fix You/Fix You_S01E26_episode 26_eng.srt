1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,310

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,510

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,420
I'm psychiatrist Ji Young Won from a mental health clinic.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,460
The patient's emotions starting rising during a consultation before the panic attack came.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,650
- It's been about 30 minutes.  
  - What's her medical history?

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,390
She has high blood pressure and depression. She's also taking anti-depressants.

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,300
- We'll do an examination first. Please call her guardians. 
 - Okay.

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,330
Let's go.

9
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,370

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,590
Three years ago, her son died in the military.

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,140
It's been a year since I've been doing consultations.

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,280
She says she always felt there was a fire growing inside of her,

13
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,870
but during our consultation today, she had a sudden panic attack.

14
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,470
She has a lot of pent up anger

15
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,940
Her tears don't stop during the entire consultation.

16
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,390
She must not have anywhere else she can comfortably cry.

17
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:54,170
She said that it seemed like a sin to let herself cry when she had also sinned in letting her children die before her.

18
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,110
What happened in the military?

19
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,910
It was an accident.

20
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,670
He was helping other soldiers get on an armed vehicle,

21
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,740
but there was an accident caused by the vehicle suddenly going in reverse.

22
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:13,130
She says she resents and regrets always teaching him to think of others before himself.

23
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,020
She says if she had taught him to think of himself rather than thinking of others,

24
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,470
he wouldn't have helped others and gotten onto the vehicle first.

25
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,040
Today, she was talking about that before she fainted.

26
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,870
If you need our help, let us know.

27
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,160
By the way, I heard you're facing a disciplinary action case.

28
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,040
What the heck? Are there rumors about that already?

29
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,870
I'll be heading out soon. I'll see you next time.

30
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,150
So lucky he gets to do consultations.

31
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,780
You can't even run your outpatient clinic?

32
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,760
I've had a patient who lost her son in the military as well.

33
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,360
- But one day, she suddenly said she would stop receiving consultations. 
 - Why?

34
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,920
She said it felt wrong to receive treatment for her anger at the hospital,

35
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,670
when her son had died. She felt too sorry toward him.

36
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,870
She said she didn't ever give him allowance.

37
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:23,240
I think the most difficult sickness to cure in the world is repairing the hearts of parents who have lost their children.

38
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,080
Though it'll be difficult, you can endure it.

39
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,790
Okay.

40
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,730

41
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,200
I want to say something to you, as a friend.

42
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,610
As a friend?

43
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,910
Is it about Lee Si Joon?

44
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,800
About Dr. Lee's disciplinary action hearing...

45
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,480
I wish you wouldn't mention personal matters in that.

46
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,360
Disregarding the hospital's procedures and publicly exposing the hospital?

47
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,260
Sure, let's consider that worthy of the hearing.

48
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:09,740
But don't make any issues of things like, for example, his relationship with his patients.

49
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,770
You told me last time,

50
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,240
a friend is someone who shares heavy burdens.

51
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,270
I did.

52
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,370
Do you know how heavy my burden is right now?

53
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:25,590
I'm about to get this hospital taken away from me by my unworthy siblings.

54
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:34,410
After I got my divorce, I've only lived for this hospital,

55
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:38,310
but because of Lee Si Joon, the entire hospital's reputation is ruined,

56
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,530
and thanks to that, I'm about to give up my position as Hospital Director.

57
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,550
If you were really my friend, instead of only thinking of Lee Si Joon,

58
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,820
shouldn't you be helping me carry my burden?

59
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,160
I didn't think of that.

60
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,200
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,530
But still, I hope you can be understanding.

62
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,230
I'm not saying this because I'm only thinking of Lee Si Joon.

63
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,420
If weird rumors starting floating around, other patients could get hurt, too.

64
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,330
I beg of you.

65
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,070
- Did you hear about Dr. Lee's disciplinary action hearing? 
 - Yes.

66
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,890
Isn't that so ridiculous?

67
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,780
Shouldn't Dr. Lee Si Joon be receiving an award, not a disciplinary action hearing?

68
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,420
That's what I'm saying. Do you think he's doing okay?

69
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,970
I know this must have not been an easy decision to make, but thank you.

70
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,750
No, um...

71
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,420
But I just heard some nurses speaking outside.

72
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,240
I heard that Dr. Lee is facing a disciplinary action hearing.

73
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,760
You don't need to worry about that.

74
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,070
Is Dr. Lee okay?

75
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,670
This hospital is a very large organization.

76
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,790
In all things, there is a procedure to them.

77
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,760
Because Dr. Lee ignored those procedures, there is a disciplinary action hearing.

78
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,730
Did the matter get worse because of me?

79
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,480
Oh, of course not.

80
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,480
This has nothing to do with you.

81
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,170
Will it really be okay?

82
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,620
Are you still feeling very uneasy these days?

83
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,130
Well, it's the opposite.

84
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,240
"Am I allowed to be this happy?"

85
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,320
I keep thinking thoughts like this.

86
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,720
My adoptive mother has said to me before

87
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,060
that I'm the seed to misfortune.

88
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,020
Do you still think that?

89
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,480
Sometimes?

90
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,070
Sometimes, whenever I feel super happy, I think of her saying that.

91
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,260
There's no reason for you to force yourself to forget it.

92
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,970
Happiness and uneasiness are a set.

93
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,660
That's the same for anyone.

94
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,120
Since today is the first day, let's just do greetings for now-

95
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,320
There's one thing I'm curious about.

96
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,800
Tell me what it is.

97
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,910
My diagnosis.

98
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,820
Dr. Lee Si Joon and Dr. Ji Young Won both

99
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,950
They've never explained to me exactly what my condition was.

100
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,010
The reason we don't tell you the name of your disease is because it doesn't help with treatment.

101
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:27,280
There are also many cases where we can't say for certain whether it's this or that.

102
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,370
 Outpatients Only

103
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,220
 Are you done with your consultation?

104
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,880
 I'm heading back home now.

105
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,040
 There's no other doctor quite as good as me, huh?

106
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,110
 You're quite understanding, to be precise.

107
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,310
 Where are you? Should we meet for a bit?

108
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,590
 I'm a bit busy today.

109
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:03,180
 I have to go apologize to Ji Sun.

110
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,990

111
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,640
- Are you Dr. In Dong Hyuk?
- Yes.

112
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,640
You know of Kang Jin Woo, right?

113
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,680
Who are you?

114
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,980
- I'm Kang Jin Woo's father. 
 - I see.

115
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:33,650
I heard you kept it a secret that my son was a drug addict.

116
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,200
Let's go inside to speak.

117
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:43,460
Are you are druggie too? Is that why you turned a blind eye?

118
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,980
Sir, what are you doing?

119
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,210
Let's head inside to speak.

120
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,960
I told Jin Woo

121
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,250
that I would bury that doctor.

122
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,360
Since I know what you look like, I'll see you next time.

123
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,990
- Who is that person? 
 - He's a patient's parent.

124
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,810
Kang Jin Woo, are you okay?

125
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,740
Your father came to the hospital.

126
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,950
I'm sorry. I got caught by my father.

127
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,980
Have you continued taking those drugs?

128
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,300
My dad asked me where I got the drugs,

129
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,880
so I told him that you gave it to me. 
 - What?

130
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,500
I lied because I thought my dad would kill my mom. I'm sorry.

131
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,010
What's going on?

132
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:48,560
He's a patient that used to habitually take methylphenidates, but he had promised me not to take it anymore.

133
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,860
- And? 
 - He bought some online because it's his exam period,

134
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,410
but then told his dad that I had prescribed it to him.

135
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,150
Do his guardians not know about it?

136
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:01,440
His mom knows, but kept it a secret from his father because he's so scary.

137
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,790
If it's that severe, shouldn't you have him be hospitalized?

138
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,400
No, it's not that severe.

139
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,980
Neither the patient nor the guardians want that either.

140
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,440
I'll deal with it on my own.

141
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,360
Unnie!

142
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,510
Did I call you out while you were busy?

143
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,230
I have about 30 minutes to spare. It is something urgent?

144
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,570
- I have something to ask you. 
 - What is it?

145
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,010
- Do you know what the name of my condition is? 
 - What?

146
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,540
You know it, right? What is it?

147
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,480
Why are you asking that to me? You should ask your primary doctor.

148
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,490
They won't tell me because they say it doesn't help my treatment.

149
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,430
Then that's true. If you know, then keep searching things on the internet,

150
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:11,390
and there's lots of falsified information online. It won't help your treatment.

151
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,500
So what is it?

152
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,910
Unni, I can't tell you.

153
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:22,760
Ji Hee, I fought with Ji Sun yesterday. It was pretty bad.

154
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,760
So I was wondering how I should apologize,

155
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,800
and I was reminded of something a doctor has told me before.

156
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:37,960
The reason I am getting so angry so often is likely not due to an ordinary intermittent explosive disorder.

157
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,230
But nobody will tell me what it is. Not even the Chief.

158
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:48,030
Do I have an incurable disease?

159
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:53,040
No! It's a bit difficult to cure, but it's not incurable.

160
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,920
It's a difficult disease?

161
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,640
What difficult disease? Isn't that the same as an incurable one?

162
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,290
Not incurable, but it'll take some time to...

163
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,570
So what is it?

164
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:12,570
I only recently found out about it. I coincidentally came across your file while looking at others'

165
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,650
files to conduct more research.

166
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,030
The doctors don't know that I saw it.

167
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,600
Shall I go to another hospital and find out?

168
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,540
What is it? What is it that you won't tell me?

169
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,890
Then I'll tell you exactly as it's stated in your consultation records.

170
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:32,510
To be exact, it says "suspected BPD".

171
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,120
BPD? What's that?

172
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,360

173
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,130

174
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:40,070
- You were diagnosed with borderline personality disorder? 
 - Yes.

175
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:43,880
Then you're likely already receiving consultations. Are you curious about something else?

176
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,610
I wanted to check something.

177
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:53,700
I heard that this disease will cause trouble for those around me. Is that true?

178
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,520
Did you search that on the internet?

179
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:00,960
Impulsive, emotional, unable to control anger.

180
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:06,920
It said that whether it be friends or lovers, I'll end up driving everyone away from me.

181
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,570
Is that true?

182
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,410
I understand why you came to see me,

183
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,700
but I can only tell you one thing.

184
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,930
 It's a disease that can be cured. It'll just take some time.

185
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,610
 Everything depends on your mentality.

186
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,620
Do you two have some time?

187
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,730
Yes. Is something the matter?

188
00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:00,820
Oh... Well, I wanted to check something about Dr. Lee Si Joon.

189
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:05,370
There's many instances in which Dr. Lee has disregarded the hospital's policies, right?

190
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:09,210
He always takes hospitalized patients on walks.

191
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:12,100
I heard he even... goes out on trips with them?

192
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,310
Is that true? I'm not certain.

193
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:19,190
Nurse Oh, didn't you used to complain about things being difficult around here because of Dr. Lee?

194
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,350
Since when have you taken his side?

195
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,950
Starting right now. I'll tell you since the topic came up,

196
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:27,380
I acknowledge that Dr. Lee is odd.

197
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,090
But what I can do about the fact that it's all for the patients?

198
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:34,260
Whether or not that was in the best interest of the patient will be determined

199
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,540
by the disciplinary action committee, not you.

200
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:41,260
Are you unaware that many nurses have been healed thanks to Dr. Lee?

201
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,510
What do you mean?

202
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:46,850
There were many more nurses suffering from depression than I thought.

203
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:51,380
Even with just the news of a potential change in the working systems of this hospital, they say they feel better.

204
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:56,170
How is that thanks to Dr. Lee? It's because of the late Nurse Heo.

205
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:04,390
Dr. Lee is the person who helped ensure that Nurse Heo's death was not in vain.

206
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:08,180
Nurse Jung, it's time for the patients to take their medication.

207
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,340
Okay.

208
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,320
Nurse Heo is Nurse Jung's colleague. Please be understanding.

209
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,260
Goodness...

210
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,330
The vice president is really too much.

211
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:41,910
He keeps asking all the nurses in other departments if the petition was really signed out of their own will.

212
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,280
You don't have anything to do with the petition.

213
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,550
It's true that the hospital was placed in a difficult situation because of me,

214
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,020
so don't be too upset about it.

215
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,740

216
00:16:55,060 --> 00:17:01,110
 Ultimately, I made everyone like that.

217
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,220
 It's a curable disease.

218
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,790
 It just takes some time.

219
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,830
 Everything depends on your mentality.

220
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,140
She said it can be cured.

221
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:31,660
 I've never given up on my dreams, unlike you!

222
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,880
 You horrible wretch.

223
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,920
I have to go apologize to Ji Sun.

224
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,980
Huh?

225
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,270
 CLOSE

226
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,400
This can't be.

227
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,930
I have to apologize.

228
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,860
The restaurant is closed?

229
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,450
Then I guess you didn't make up with Ms. Kong?

230
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,780
Today isn't the only day. I'll just do it tomorrow.

231
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,200
Of course.

232
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,500
Doctor, please don't worry about me anymore.

233
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,100
Why would I worry about you, Woo Joo?

234
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,730
You didn't tell me about the disciplinary committee because you were worried about me.

235
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,870
You caught me.

236
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,590
You know,

237
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,620
I will protect you from now on, Doctor.

238
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:35,890
I will make only good things happen for you, every day.

239
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:39,060
Did you drink, by any chance?

240
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,410
Just a moment. I'll call you back.

241
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,330
What's wrong?

242
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:54,230
Oh, this isn't good.

243
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,470
Oh no, this won't do.

244
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,140
Please don't do this.

245
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,050
You can't do this.

246
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,330
Oh no, why?

247
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,470

248
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,870
When did you come?

249
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,600
My feet just brought me here by themselves.

250
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,970
You seem like you had a drink.

251
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,800
What about food?

252
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,860
Doctor, you're good at making ramyeon, too.

253
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,690
Is it hard? Just put it in water and boil it.

254
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:25,240
It would have been better if you weren't so great, Doctor.

255
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,680
You're so fun, you're so cool, and you're so skilled, too.

256
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:38,450
You're so perfect that it's hard to find any flaw.

257
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,320
Why are you saying that so suddenly, Woo Joo?

258
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:46,500
Your smile is a work of art, and you're even cute from time to time.

259
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,620
So you've had a lot to drink, huh?

260
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:54,470
I shouldn't even dare to want to be with you.

261
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:59,970
Doctor, it really would have been better if you weren't so great.

262
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:03,480
Then I would feel better about liking you.

263
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,350
And how nice would it be if you weren't a doctor?

264
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,590
It would be great if you were unemployed.

265
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,250
- Woo Joo.
 - Don't say anything, please.

266
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,580
This is how I feel right now.

267
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,240
You said this before, Woo Joo,

268
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,910
that someone who recognizes an ill person is someone who is even more ill.

269
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:32,380
I am someone who is as ill as you are.

270
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:37,640
And I'm not as perfect as you think I am.

271
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,900
So you can like me as much as you want, comfortably.

272
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,290
Do you remember that flower?

273
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:49,390
The flower that bloomed in the alley by Kong Rice House.

274
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,900
The flower that I sang to?

275
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,220
It had wilted.

276
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,920
Seeing that, my heart suddenly collapsed.

277
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,960
It's the flower that you and I raised together.

278
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,140
Flowers all bloom and wilt.

279
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,710
For the sake of the coming season.

Dr. In, later at the disciplinary committee hearing,

308
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:08,230
can you testify regarding the relationship between Lee Si Joon and Han Woo Joo?

309
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,820
I even have photos for evidence.

310
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,590
Want to see them?

311
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,670
But those are weaker than I thought.

312
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:26,160
And Lee Si Joon could deny it.

313
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,950
But if you testify, I'm sure everyone will believe it.

314
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,090
I cannot do that.

315
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:36,670
Dr. In, why do you live such a complicated life?

316
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:42,010
I don't understand why you would even do this, Vice President.

317
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:45,000
I will help you become the head of the clinic until the end.

318
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,440
But I cannot do these kinds of things with you.

319
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,230
What?

320
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,160
He has photos of me and Woo Joo?

321
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,760
You didn't even know that you were being photographed?

322
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,090
The issue is becoming blurred.

323
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:09,000
They will definitely pick on this to come after you. What will you do?

324
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,330
I am Lee Si Joon.

325
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:30,520
I will give up all my rights to defend myself.

326
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:36,270
I will accept whatever decision the disciplinary committee makes.

327
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:44,790

328
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:48,890
♫  If I knew you better  ♫

329
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:52,170
 Fix You

330
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,870
 Control emotions.

331
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:56,390
 How dare you do a background check on someone?

332
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,930
 Why do you live in such a shameful way?

333
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,540
 This punk! You really-

334
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,810
 How dare you look down on me when you're a drug addict?

335
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,510
 You want to lose your medical license, huh?

336
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:06,690
 How did they pick such people to be nurses, huh?

337
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:09,660
 Is there a good way to treat repressed anger?

338
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:13,050
 I hope someone can tell me what sort of child I was.

339
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:16,540
 This was among the belongings of the late Sister Lucia.

340
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,880
 Please come.

341
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,110
 I am so scared and afraid right now.

342
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,200
♫  I miss you  ♫
