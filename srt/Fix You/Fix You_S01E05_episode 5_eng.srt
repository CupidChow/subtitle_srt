1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,450
I am a crazy woman, actually.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,690
So you're right about that, but do you have the confidence?

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,390
The confidence to fix me?

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,460
Ms. Woo Joo, you're not crazy.

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,550
You're ill.

6
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:29,800
Once you acknowledge that you are sick, I can start to treat you.

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,720
You have a disease too, doctor.

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,570
You're a work addict.

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,110
You must see everyone as a patient.

10
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,490
But I'm not sick.

11
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,230
I just have a horrible temper.

12
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:52,060
I appreciate the gesture, but I'll take care of my own temper.

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,400
Good night.

14
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:06,610

15
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,370
What kind of doctor recruits patients?

16
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,190
Should I have told him I'm already getting therapy?

17
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,540
 Han Woo Joo turned me down. I think it'll take some time.

18
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,770
 So what if it takes some time? It'll be fine as long as you don't give up.

19
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,460
 You know a bad doctor isn't one with no skill, but one that quits, right?

20
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,560
Why is she threatening me?

21
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,770

22
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,060
Hello.

23
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,830
How was your sleep?

24
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,170
Leave. Leave. Leave!

25
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,190
Patient Kang got no sleep yesterday.

26
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,250
Leave!

27
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,120
Leave, leave, leave...

28
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,820
Are you still only eating chips?

29
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:57,510
Just give me the medicine, instead of asking this and that.

30
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,550
If you keep avoiding conversation, the treatment won't work.

31
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,820
Call from the director!

32
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,320
You too?

33
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,810
I wonder what's wrong.

34
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,220
It must be an emergency patient.

35
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,190
Sung Min Ho. 32 years old, male.

36
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,370
A few days ago, he came to the ER due to an extreme stomachache.

37
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,050
The results of an upper X-ray endoscopy found foreign matter in the upper body,

38
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,900
so he got surgery right away. Turns out he was pica patient.

39
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:10,360
What was the foreign matter found in his stomach?

40
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,330
Paper.

41
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,520

42
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,070
He swallowed a house whole.

43
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,340
I think I may know this patient.

44
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,160
How?

45
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,250
 Sung Min Ho!

46
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,130
 F-Father...

47
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,740
 You pathetic jerk.

48
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,000
 You worthless punk.

49
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,790
 When are you going to become a person?

50
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,330
 S-S... I'm sorry.

51
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,900
He seemed really anxious.

52
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,100
Dr. Lee, you take this patient.

53
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,180
Okay, I'll do that.

54
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,340
How is patient Hwang Bo Young?

55
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,980
I've prescribed her some medication.

56
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,660
Recently, it's been discovered that cyproheptadine, which is used to treat symptoms of an allergy

57
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,450
may suppress the effects of serotonin,

58
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,440
which depresses satiation and causes excessive eating. We're looking into that.

59
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,650
We've been pairing that with psychological treatment,

60
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,810
but she refuses to even converse with me.

61
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,660
Either way, keep watching over her.

62
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,180
Okay.

63
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,850
Alright, good work everyone.

64
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,750
Yes.

65
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,570
Thank you, sir.

66
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,960
I'll head out then.

67
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,390
See you. Good work.

68
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,390
He really ate a lot.

69
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,690
Where is this patient now?

70
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,350
I was just getting discharged after my surgery.

71
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:33,910
I was surprised when they told me to come to the psychiatry department.

72
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,150
Why? Are you uncomfortable here?

73
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:41,650
It's not uncomfortable, but rather... I don't understand.

74
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:47,810
You ate paper, right? That shows signs of pica, which is a type of eating disorder.

75
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,480
It usually stems from depression or anxiety,

76
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,000
so I just wanted to chat with you for a bit.

77
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,220
Do you eat paper often?

78
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,800
It was my first time.

79
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,630
How does it taste? I've never had it before.

80
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,590
Each type of paper tastes different. It feels different, too.

81
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,280
It has a slightly sweet taste.

82
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,130
You know a lot, considering it was your first time.

83
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,890
Do you have perfect taste, or something like that?

84
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,660
Why did you eat it?

85
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,560
I just...

86
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,740
wondered what it would taste like.

87
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,200
I-I-I was curious.

88
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,720
Something happened before you ate it, right?

89
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,590
Can you tell me about that?

90
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:49,540
I work at a paper crafting company.

91
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,160
We make models of buildings using paper,

92
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,480
then deliver them to paper museums or model homes.

93
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:07,860
I think I suddenly felt hungry then.

94
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,920
They were models that were about to be delivered, too.

95
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,280
What is this? What happened?

96
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,090
- Why are these like this? 
 - We worked so hard on it...

97
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,940
It was you. You did this, right?

98
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,990
You crazy bastard! Are you crazy?

99
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,910
I suddenly couldn't breathe and fainted.

100
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:46,030
What kind of person is your father?

101
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,890
My father?

102
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,790
He's the person I respect the most in the world. He built himself up from nothing, all alone.

103
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,840
Someone like me couldn't even start to follow in his footsteps.

104
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,740
When the heck will I become a person...

105
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,410
I always feel apologetic towards my father.

106
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:13,120
From the pictures, it seemed like you swallowed the houses whole. Why did you do that?

107
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,510
What if it had gotten stuck in your throat?

108
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:20,610
I didn't want to chew on the house.

109
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,390
If I chewed it, it would get ruined.

110
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:36,450
♫  A morning covered in heavy fog,  ♫

111
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:43,480
♫  We were dragged away   ♫

112
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:50,520
♫  For what reasons? Where?  ♫

113
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:58,050
♫  Nobody answers me  ♫

114
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:05,630
 Your acting is good and your singing is not bad, but your scandal bothers me...

115
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,730
 Let's meet again once things settle down.

116
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,470
It's all nonsense!

117
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:22,140
Sunbae, I heard you have a performance coming up.

118
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,700
Do you not need another actor?

119
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,060
I just won the rookie of the year award.

120
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,650
What do you mean, why did I get the award?

121
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:42,500
Why should I have turned it down? I didn't do anything wrong!

122
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,400
Is that something you should be saying to me right now?

123
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,560
- Enjoy your meal. 
 - Thank you.

124
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,330
- Can we order, please? 
 - Just one moment.

125
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,850
- Can we get some water? 
 - Water is self-service, over there.

126
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,130
- Sorry about that! 
 - How much longer do we have to wait?

127
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,520
I'll be out soon!

128
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,460
I'm coming!

129
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,890
What would you like to order?

130
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,890
- Two of the stir-fried meat, please. 
 - Okay, two stir-fried!

131
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,170
- Which table?
 - This one is for number 2.

132
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,950
Okay!

133
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,200
Can we get more side dishes here?

134
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,510
Just wait one moment, please!

135
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,490
Something happened today.

136
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,170
 Sung Min Ho!

137
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,640
 I didn't want to chew on the house.

138
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,340
 If I chewed  it, it would get ruined.

139
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
Hello?

140
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,230
Patient Sung Min Ho was treated for anxiety three years ago.

141
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,340
What was the cause of his anxiety?

142
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,540
It was out of fear of his father.

143
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,090
If it was three years ago, don't you think he would have fully recovered by now?

144
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,630
It's probably gotten worse.

145
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,510
Pica usually shows up

146
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:57,140
in 1 to 4 year-old children, not adults.

147
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,690
Whenever Sung Min Ho gets anxious, he stutters

148
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,860
and bites his fingertips.

149
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,970
Those are all symptoms you observe in children as well.

150
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,070
I think his pica could have something to do with his anxiety.

151
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:16,290
Conclusively, the reason he swallowed the house whole seems to be due to an attachment to his home.

152
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,760
He must have sustained trauma from when he was younger.

153
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,070
In cases like these, the person that actually needs treatment

154
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,950
is not the person who was hurt, but the person who made the offense.

155
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:29,460
Dr Lee, what does that mean?

156
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:34,750
In order to treat patient Sung Min Ho, we have to first treat his father.

157
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,830
How are we going to treat his father who doesn't even come to the hospital?

158
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:45,400
Figuring that out... is your job!

159
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,560
Unni, I'm here!

160
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,210
- Hello. 
 - Welcome in.

161
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,000
Dr. Lee, long time no see.

162
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,330
It's been a while, right?

163
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,120
- Woo Joo, you're here too?
 - Oh, hi.

164
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,800
Is that the musical—

165
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,890
Yes, that's correct. I lost my job because of that incident, so now I'm a part-timer here.

166
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,360
Sorry.

167
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,830
If you haven't eaten yet, would you like to join us?

168
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,960
Part-timers don't socialize with customers.

169
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,430
What are you going to eat?

170
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,740
Please come again!

171
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,230
Sorry, but we're done for the day.

172
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,990
We're just going to eat fast and leave.

173
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,640
We're actually all out of ingredients too. Sorry about that.

174
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,150
We'll be really quick.

175
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:42,060
If you come back next time, we'll be sure to treat you especially well.

176
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,850
It's her, right? It's you?

177
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,190
The musical actress.

178
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:51,090
Yes. I'm Han Woo Joo.

179
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:57,330
Wow, you're totally fine. I don't think I could go around in public after being massively humiliated like that.

180
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:02,370
Well, I guess everyone needs to be a bit shameless.

181
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,940
Let's go.

182
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,460
I didn't drive under the influence.

183
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,520
What are you saying? I saw you getting handcuffed on TV.

184
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:16,430
He wasn't even a real police, and I didn't do that!

185
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,210
This woman must be crazy!

186
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,670
Why on earth are you screaming?

187
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,000
- Stop that. 
 - But I didn't do that.

188
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,830
You should get your facts straight before yapping around!

189
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,390
Are you crazy!

190
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,520
Are you going to hit me? Trying to hit me?

191
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,390
Hit me then, so I can earn some compensation money!

192
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,240
Let me go!

193
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,930
Hit me!

194
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,580
Hey, Jong Won!

195
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,740
Excuse me.

196
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,970
Customer, hello?

197
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,720
Don't we need to call 911?

198
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,420
He should be okay. Don't worry too much.

199
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,190
Get home safe.

200
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,250
- Thank you for the meal. 
 - See you.

201
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,270
What would you have done if that customer had split his head open?

202
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,310
I suddenly just got so angry...

203
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,610
Sorry.

204
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,280
Do you think other people don't know how to be angry?

205
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:00,440
Can you please fix that temper of yours? This isn't the first time something has gone wrong because of your hot temper.

206
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,570
You've ruined more than one or two relationships.

207
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,340
I kept it in for a long time today.

208
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,450
I had an outburst because I was keeping it in all day.

209
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:16,220
You haven't been getting therapy lately, have you?

210
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,230
Do I look like a patient to you, too?

211
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,930
You're all ridiculous!

212
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,320
Hey.

213
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:34,360
I'm the one that should be angry at you!

214
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,100
Did I say anything that was wrong?

215
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:41,180
It was all fine until the end. Why did you suddenly bring up therapy?

216
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,310
I'm just worried about her.

217
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,860
There must have been many things that upset you today.

218
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,040
How did you know?

219
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,890
Just based on your arm strength earlier. 'Bam!'

220
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,860
Did you fail your audition again?

221
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,980
Are you a fortune teller?

222
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,680
Ever since I was young, people have told me I have a sixth sense.

223
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,920
Are all psychiatrists like you?

224
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,150
Not at all, I'm unrivaled.

225
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,330
Gosh, those idiots.

226
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:35,710
Your singing touches so many people,

227
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,870
but they don't even realize that.

228
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:42,670
- Right? 
 - Have you heard my singing before?

229
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,170
Nope.

230
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:47,720
You really are unrivaled.

231
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,070
- What is this? 
 - A present.

232
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,300
Look at it when you get home.

233
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:26,350
You know the hospital is open 24/7, right? You can come anytime.

234
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,830
Oh, my bad... I'm sorry.

235
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,250
My work addiction, again...

236
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,390
Just pretend you didn't hear that.

237
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,460
You're quite persistent.

238
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,070
 Prescription:

239
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,610
 Do some exercises at night.

240
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,750
What is this?

241
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,960
What am I doing?

242
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,500

243
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,430
Hello?

244
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,960
Yes,

245
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,770
I'll be right over.

246
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:54,990
Father! Father!

247
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,460
Father! Father!

248
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,360
Are you Si Joon?

249
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:11,940
Yes. It's me.

250
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,240
What are you doing?

251
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,350
Aren't you cold?

252
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:24,430
It's cold. Gosh, I'm cold.

253
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,990
It's cold...

254
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,980
 Dr. Lee!

255
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,430
 Dr. Lee! Where are you?

256
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,400
 Where are you?

257
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,680
 Dr. Lee!

258
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,750
 Dr. Lee!

259
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,740
He always goes on his rounds, twice a day.

260
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:14,070
When the other residents here get sick, they ask for your father instead of me.

261
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,520
He gets along with people well.

262
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,710
Earlier, he recognized me.

263
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,200
These days, he frequently comes to his senses.

264
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,710
He runs out every time that happens.

265
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:32,680
What happened to the patient my father tried to operate on?

266
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,390
He's at a nearby hospital.

267
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:39,120
It's fortunate it was just a small suture. If it was a larger procedure, it would've been much worse.

268
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,590
We can't constantly be watching over him,

269
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:46,250
but we can't tie him up either.

270
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,360
I'm really sorry.

271
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,130
Who are you?

272
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,290
Are you a new resident?

273
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:17,210
What are you doing here? Hurry, get ready to run rounds.

274
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,860
Why are you just standing there?

275
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:27,100
- I don't think you need to go on your rounds today. 
 - What?

276
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:31,620
I just checked on all the patients. Everything seems fine.

277
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:37,750
What would you know, you cheeky punk? You're the smartest one we've gotten in a while.

278
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:44,560
I wish my son was like you.

279
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:49,290
He's a doctor too.

280
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:51,940
He must have taken after you.

281
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,380
Him? He doesn't have even half my skill.

282
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:59,120
Why? He's a crazy psychiatrist.

283
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,410
Me? I'm a magician.

284
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,780
My son has never done anything to my liking.

285
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:12,930
I should've stopped him at all costs.

286
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,300
Do you want to be my son instead?

287
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:22,560
Why, do you not like it? I can give you all of my inheritance.

288
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,160
You must have a lot of money hidden away somewhere.

289
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:32,080
Money? Not at all. My inheritance is not money.

290
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,590
It's these two hands.

291
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:44,940
They were incredible hands that everyone acknowledged.

292
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,670
I was envious as well.

293
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,730
 Father...

294
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,120
 By conducting a transplant using a portion of the patient's sibling's liver,

295
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,790
 we have overcome the transplant rejection.

296
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:52,320
 It has been 4 weeks since the patient received the liver transplant,

297
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,400
 and he is maintaining his health. That is all.

298
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,850
 Father!

299
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:11,030
 Gosh, it's so cold. It's cold.
