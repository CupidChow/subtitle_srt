1
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,570
Hurry, we need to hurry.

2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,540
Are the GPS results out?

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,890
It's near Yeouido, by the Han River.

4
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,870
Officer Cha, go to the Information Center.

5
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,270
Okay.

6
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,930
 Episode 25

7
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:35,410

8
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,320
We've confirmed her location to be within a 1 km radius from the center of Han River in Yeouido.

9
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,720
Officer Cha, are you ready?

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,060
Yes, we've prepared everything as you've asked.

11
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,040
 Soul Mechanic

12
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,890
Let's begin.

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,950
 Soul Mechanic Podcast - Live

14
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,290
Dear listeners,

15
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,550
Soul Mechanic Podcast is broadcasting live from Yeouido Han River Park.

16
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,400
We request everyone in the area to look around you.

17
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,650
Check if anyone seems like they are about to make an irreversible choice.

18
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,430
Nurse Na, can you hear my voice right now?

19
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,130
Nurse Na, you can hear me, right?

20
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,120
What you're feeling right now is not wanting to die.

21
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,740
You want to speak.

22
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,030
With your death, you are trying to speak the things you want to say with your actions.

23
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,730
But if you die, you can't speak your truth.

24
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,000
Then what do I do?

25
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,430
What do you want me to do?

26
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,410
The reason you pick death, is because you want to deny the realities of this world,

27
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:06,770
and be reborn into a new life.

28
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:11,690
However, that's only a delusion you have about a world you haven't been to yet.

29
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,410
I will deliver your words for you.

30
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,270
I will tell your story,

31
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,080
no, our stories, to everyone in the world.

32
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,470
Nurse Na.

33
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,490
Don't come closer.

34
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,640
I understand how you feel right now.

35
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,350
You feel trapped,

36
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:51,580
and you see no alternative to death.

37
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,470
However, death will not lesson your feelings of sorrow or being wronged.

38
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:01,000
- Then what can I do? 
 - What can your death do?

39
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,540
 Police

40
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,650
 Dear listeners,

41
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,650
Please take a moment of silence

42
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,670
for the late Heo Min Young, who recently passed away.

43
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,670
 The responsible party for Heo Min Young's death

44
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:49,770
 is the workplace which she loved.

45
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:06,260
 Heo Min Young was someone who lead an altruistic life, and became a sacrifice of the systems in her workplace.

46
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:11,910
 The rest of us were bystanders, who were also not free of the system.

47
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,500
 The victim died, and the bystanders lived.

48
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:24,430
 We must resist unjust conventions and spark change.

49
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:31,460
 That is the task we must complete as the survivors.

50
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,030
 Suicide is not something that results from a lack of determination.

51
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,840
 An average of 37.5 people per day.

52
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:47,310
 This number is something everyone living together in this world must take responsibility for.

53
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,390
- Escort her safely. 
 - Don't worry. I'll be off.

54
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,050
 Police

55
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:13,320
Today felt like a super long day.

56
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,940
A lot of things happened.

57
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,960
- But there's something I'm worried about. 
 - What is it?

58
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,300
What if something happens at the hospital again.

59
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,150
It'll be okay, right?

60
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,780
So what if something happens? We saved a person.

61
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,120
That's right.

62
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,140
 Eun Kang Medical Center

63
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,920
 The Unfortunate Death of a Nurse at Eun Kang Hospital

64
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,730
 Eun Kang Medical Center

65
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,940
Hospital Director, the reporters are here.

66
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,280
I've already told the reporters

67
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,750
that we will only be accepting questions pertaining to the Mental Health Clinic for this interview.

68
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,610
Tell them to come in.

69
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:24,530
Please say a few words about the intentions behind establishing Eun Kang Medical Center's Mental Health Clinic.

70
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:29,220
Before I answer that question, I have something I'd like to say.

71
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:35,240
Recently, a nurse from our hospital unfortunately decided to take her own life.

72
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:42,900
We acknowledge that the cause of these events were due to issues in the system of the working environments of our hospital.

73
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,020
We will make changes to ensure no more similar, unfortunate events are repeated,

74
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:52,250
and want to use this opportunity to express my apologies for the family of the deceased.

75
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:57,050
It seems like you're agreeing to all the contents of the podcast which aired last night.

76
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,890
Were you not displeased by  that podcast?

77
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,310
The podcast that was aired last night

78
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,810
was done so after reaching an agreement with me.

79
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,160
I allowed that podcast.

80
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,080
I understand. Thank you for your answer.

81
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,660
The Hospital Director called at dawn.

82
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:21,220
She said she would call a reporter, and tell them the contents of the podcast were all things agreed upon.

83
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:25,130
Wow, she really has sense.

84
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,520
Is this a time to joke around?

85
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,220
Did you have to do that?

86
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,440
Do you think I made plans to do that?

87
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,260
I had no other option if I wanted to save Nurse Na.

88
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,630
Well, though the Hospital Director had no choice but to acknowledge her wrongdoings,

89
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,160
things won't just end like this.

90
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,400
I've braced myself for it.

91
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:51,280
You're so optimistic.

92
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,310
All organizations have a procedure.

93
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,400
Lee Si Joon ignored those procedures.

94
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,980
Is this the only time he's disregarded rules and procedures?

95
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,180
He always does as he pleases.

96
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,960
Please initiate the process of disciplinary action against Lee Si Joon.

97
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,160
Disciplinary action?

98
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,100
Don't you think this warrants disciplinary action?

99
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,480
Of course! There's plenty reason to initiate disciplinary action.

100
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,190
There have already been multiple instances of you turning a blind eye for him.

101
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:30,100
I will investigate everything thoroughly.

102
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,310
Yes?

103
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,180
Your face seems brighter. You must have gotten a good night's sleep.

104
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,800
I did. How did you know?

105
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,000
Dr. Lee, we will be putting together a committee of disciplinary action to investigate you.

106
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,460
Pardon? What did I do wrong?

107
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,760
You think you're the only one living in this world.

108
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,310
Is this because of the podcast?

109
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:04,000
I heard the Hospital Director told reporters that was something she agreed to air.

110
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,550
Then isn't it settled?

111
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:10,510
Dr. Lee, all things have a procedure.

112
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:15,590
Is this the only time you've ignored the hospital rules and acted as you pleased?

113
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:21,190
I understand. I can attend the disciplinary action hearing and explain myself.

114
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:27,860
Don't take any new patients for consultations until the results of the disciplinary action hearing come out.

115
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,410
To my knowledge, such rules don't exist.

116
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,770
I'm the Vice President of this hospital. I made the rule, right now.

117
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,990
Before we start, let's work on our breathing technique.

118
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,140
When we do breath training...

119
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,930
Here. I'll show you an example, you have to copy what I do, okay?

120
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,580
We'll start with 'ha'. Grab your apples.

121
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,830
Okay. We're going to pick it.

122
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,520
- Ha! 
 - Ha!

123
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,430
- He! 
 - He!

124
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,060
The point is that your body moves with the sound.

125
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,590
Now 'hee', ready?

126
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:10,190
- Hee! 
 - Hee!

127
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,640
Ho!

128
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,100
♫  My difficult day   ♫

129
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,140
♫  gets a little better.  ♫

00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:32,890

132
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,760

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,800

135
00:10:54,550 --> 00:11:00,460
♫  My feelings that don't feel like my own.  ♫

00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,740
 This happiness will last, right?

137
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,140
 It'll last.

Thank you.

150
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,020
- That's everything, right? 
 - Yeah, that's everything.

151
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:52,320
Mom? Is something wrong?

152
00:11:53,310 --> 00:12:00,610
Mom, about that day. I'm really, really sor-

153
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,180
I'm really sorry.

154
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,060
Yes? You can tell me whatever.

155
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,110
Okay.

156
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,140
I'll figure it out for you. Don't worry.

157
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:25,140
What do you mean, thanks. Of course I should do it.

158
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,980
Then I'll call you back. Yes.

159
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,620
Who is it? I thought I heard you addressing your mom.

160
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,150
- Yes, it's my mom. 
 - Your adoptive mother?

161
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,270
Why is that woman suddenly calling you?

162
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,320
Didn't you say  you totally cut ties with her last time?

163
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,800
Well, just because. She was curious how I was doing.

164
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,310
If you went to find her, she always avoided you,

165
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:49,840
as if they had seen a bug. Why would people like that suddenly be curious as to how you're doing?

166
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,030
- That's a bit weird. 
 - What's weird? You're more weird.

167
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,300
Hello!

168
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,020
Hello!

169
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,440
Oh no, ma'am. You don't like the hospital but you're back again.

170
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,720
What do you mean, ma'am? We're not that many years apart.

171
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,390
We could even be lovers.

172
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,360
If your hand shaking a lot?

173
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,630
It's not shaking. I'm totally normal.

174
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,090
Starting today, Dr. Noh will start consultations with you.

175
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,950
I understand.

176
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,850
She says that she's feeling queasy since yesterday.

177
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:36,060
Oh no, ma'am. You're thinking of your youngest child again, aren't you?

178
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,330
Then... your eldest?

179
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,580
The youngest? Your husband?

180
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:47,900
Oh, right. Your boyfriend...

181
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,190
There's really nothing you can't say, is there?

182
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,150
You laughed!

183
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,130
Ms. Park Keum Ja. Judging from how she keeps saying she feels nauseous, I think it's a side effect of her drugs.

184
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,600
Haven't we already been switching out the drugs we've been prescribing her?

185
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,040
Yes. We've switched them out.

186
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,270
But the one that she's taking right now is the one with the least side effects.

187
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,660
Then why don't you try altering the time of administration and decreasing the dosage.

188
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,920
Okay.

189
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,760
Okay then... disperse!

190
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,160
Good work.

191
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,960
Dr. Lee! Why is there a disciplinary action committee being opened for you?

192
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,590
It's nothing much. Don't worry about it.

193
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:31,010
How could I not worry about it, when your situation is all because of us nurses?

194
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:34,390
It's not. It's not because of the nurses,

195
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,920
but because of what I've done as a psychiatrist.

196
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,480
There's no reason for me to face disciplinary action, so don't worry about it.

197
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,490
Don't try to take care of it all yourself. Is there anything we can do to help?

198
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,510
Well, it you really want to help, maybe treat me to a cup of coffee?

199
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,370
Dr. Lee!

200
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,750
You really don't have to worry.

201
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,300
Why is he like that?

202
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,190
Nurse Oh, is it true?

203
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,030
Did you all not know?

204
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,840
Why is he facing disciplinary action?

205
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,920
Isn't it because of the podcast? Our hospital was shamed by the whole nation.

206
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:28,450
I'm sure that's the reason for it, but I don't think he could face charges for that since the hospital director allowed it.

207
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,840
Won't they use something else as an excuse?

208
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,160
I have heard a strange rumor.

209
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,940
What rumor?

210
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,970
That the doctor is dating Han Woo Joo.

211
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,760
He wouldn't be disciplined for that, would he?

212
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,740
That is ridiculous.

213
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,270
Han Woo Joo is his patient. Let's not speak such nonsense.

214
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:46,100
Han Woo Joo is a patient, too? What kind of patient?

215
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,440
She has IED (Intermittent Explosive Disorder).

216
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:57,590
So what if they're dating? It's not as if there's a law that says a doctor and his patient can't date.

217
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,840
There are even doctors who married their patients.

218
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:05,550
Of course, there is no law against it. But if someone wants to make it into a problem, doesn't it become a problem?

219
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,820
Does this make sense? Does it make any sense at all?

220
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,770
The fact that you are facing disciplinary action itself is wrong.

221
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,590
You better explain yourself properly this time.

222
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,680
Don't assert your pride uselessly. Got it?

223
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,770
I understand.

224
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:33,790
What is the point of all this? You must not accept anything beyond wage reduction.

225
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,770
Even the wage reduction seems unfair. What have I done wrong?

226
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:39,460
If you don't defend yourself properly, you will be suspended.

227
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:43,010
A month at least. It could even be several months.

228
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,320
Then what will happen to my patients?

229
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,020
So defend yourself well.

230
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:51,290
The disciplinary committee is not all made up of Vice President's people.

231
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:54,950
So it all depends on how you defend yourself.

232
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,560
Ok.

233
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,250
And they'll definitely bring up Han Woo Joo.

234
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:04,760
Tell them that you are doctor and patient. Absolutely nothing more.

235
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:10,090
Why won't you answer me? That is my biggest worry.

236
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,710
I understand.

237
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:15,720
And the Vice President is making an intense effort to become the Clinic's head.

238
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,270
So he will absolutely try to use this as an opportunity, so be careful.

239
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,120
You really won't tell me?

240
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,820
About what?

241
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,710
Why did your adoptive mother suddenly call you?

242
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,860
She's not someone who ever just calls you.

243
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,730
Did she ask to borrow money again?

244
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,180
How did you know that?

245
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,930
So what did you tell her? You didn't tell her you would give to her, did you?

246
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:53,340
How can I ignore her? She didn't ask for that much.

247
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,360
Is it about the amount?

248
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,380
Those people are really shameless. How can they even think about borrowing money from you again?

249
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:06,080
Think about how desperate Mom must have been to call me. She never calls me.

250
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,850
So I felt sorry for her. How she must have no one she could ask, that she had to ask me.

251
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:15,930
Why do you feel sorry? You should get angry. Why do you not get angry over this, of all things?

252
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,470
Hello? I'm not Woo Joo, I'm Woo Joo's friend.

253
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,220
I hear that you asked to borrow money from her?

254
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,040
- Hey!
 - Aren't you too much?

255
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,540
You've never considered her your daughter.

256
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:33,560
You really have no conscience. Woo Joo has forgotten you and living well, so please don't even make her suffer again.

257
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,020
Mom, hello? Mom, Mom.

258
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,860
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

259
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,930
Please just listen to me.

260
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,740
Hello? Mom? Don't hang up.

261
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,430
Hello...

262
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,200
What did you just do?

263
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,720
I said the things you couldn't say for you.

264
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,030
You have someone that you love now

265
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:01,950
and you're teaching kids at the school. There's no need for you to be dragged around by people like this.

266
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,590
- Who are you to interfere in my life?
 - What?

267
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:16,610
Who are you to interfere in my life?!?

268
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,030
What should we eat?

269
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,360
We're closed for business today.

270
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,200
I'm sorry, we're not open today. I'm sorry.

271
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,180
What are you doing right now?

272
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,260
Who are you to tell me what to do?

273
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,560
It's the first time Mom called me.

274
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:41,700
Whether she's asking to borrow money, or whether she's asking for my heart, it's up to me.

275
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,280
What right do you have? It means so much that she found me at all.

276
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,260
How dare you ruin that for me? Who are you to do that?

277
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,080
What right do you have to ruin that?

278
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,900
Wow, were you this stupid?

279
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,860
I didn't know you were this bad.

280
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,520
Okay, I'm stupid.

281
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,830
I'm stupid, but I'm a little smarter than you. Do you know why?

282
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:04,410
Because I've never given up on my dreams even once, like you did.

283
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,120
You awful b**ch.

284
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,890
To think that I thought of you as a friend all this time.

285
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,390
So if I wasn't your friend, what was I?

286
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,650
Did you tolerate me because you felt sorry for me?

287
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,420
Yes, I pitied you, so I tolerated you.

288
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,470
- What's going on?
 - Whatever you did, I tried to understand you.

289
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,390
- Are they fighting?
 - Who are you to pity me?

290
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:32,830
I'm not pitiful. You're more pitiful.

291
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,230
- Don't yell.
 - I will yell!

292
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,670
- Don't yell!
 - I will if I want to!

293
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,500
- Doctor, please take her away from here.
 - Hey.

294
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,420
Even if you stopped me, I would leave.

295
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,980
Hurry and go. Don't ever come back, don't set one foot in here.

296
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,750
I will never come back! Eat well and live well.

297
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,140
Because I will live well too!

298
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,760
I'm in the wrong, aren't I?

299
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,930
You said Ms. Kong was your only friend.

300
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:28,340
Friends should embrace each other's hurts, no matter what.

301
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,370
And that seemed to be a secret that Ms. Kong only told you, Woo Joo.

302
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,360
Yes, it's true.

303
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,940
She said she can't even tell her family.

304
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,050
Look at that.

305
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:47,500
So I made a mistake again.

306
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,360
What's wrong with me, anyway?

307
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,560
It's alright, just apologize.

308
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,400
I'll apologize to her tomorrow.

309
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,750
Yes, make sure you really beg forgiveness.

310
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,910
Okay?

311
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:02,190
Is this entertaining to you?

312
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:08,270
Why did your adoptive mother suddenly call you?

313
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:11,500
You said she's never contacted you first.

314
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,220
She was in need of some money.

315
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,360
I know. I know it all.

316
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:26,780
I know Ji Sun is just looking out for me, and I know I'm just being used.

317
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,670
But you're okay with that?

318
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,040
Whether she uses me or not,

319
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:37,690
the fact that my mom sought me out means that she's thinking of me.

320
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,820
It means she didn't erase my phone number.

321
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,910
Oh right.

322
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:57,100
The customers were talking about the podcast a lot earlier. Did anything happen?

323
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,220
Well... not yet.

324
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,940
That's a relief. I worried a lot.

325
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:09,510
You said worry is something that only grows as you do it. So why would you worry?

326
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:12,230
That's what I'm saying.

327
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:18,760
By the way... I'll be getting consultations from the Chief now.

328
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,000
What do you mean?

329
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,970
Did the Chief say something?

330
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:26,070
No. I made that decision.

331
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:29,840
I don't want to be your patient anymore.

332
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,380
I want to be your girlfriend.

333
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,420
I don't like it because I feel like I keep being weak in front of you.

334
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,750
There's no other meaning behind it.

335
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,740
I think that'll make me less insecure.

336
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,100
- Ms. Woo Joo- 
 - If you don't listen to me,

337
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,010
I'm going to move to a different hospital altogether.

338
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,880
Please listen to me. Please?

339
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,740
Vice President,

340
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,390
as far as things have turned out this way, should we put him on probation for 6 months?

341
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,660
Then, won't he get frustrated and quit on his own?

342
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:26,350
There is such a thing as procedure, you know.

343
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:33,550
I heard he was dating his patient. Couldn't you use that as a cause for discipline, too?

344
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:36,160
What do you think, Dr. In?

345
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:40,100
I don't think we should include any patients in a discipline process.

346
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,560
Why not?

347
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,170
We need to think about the perspective of the patient.

348
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,860
They could face criticism depending on the way you look at it,

349
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,630
but that isn't good cause for disciplinary action.

350
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:56,040
Dr. In, you're so refined.

351
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,770
Yes, refinement is good.

352
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:03,600
I thought Dr. In had a lot of grudges built up against Dr. Lee.

353
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,810
If you keep acting so refined, how are you ever going to catch up to him?

354
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,600
You're laughing?

355
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,690
Well, if you're trying to say Dr. Lee is a golden spoon,

356
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:18,560
and I'm a spoon made of dirt, you're correct.
(Korean social class is often referred to as gold, silver, and dirt spoons)

357
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,080
It's true I've lived with an inferiority complex towards my friend, Dr. Lee.

358
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:28,410
However, the reason I'm here with the Vice President is not to overcome my inferiority complex.

359
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:33,190
There's only one reason I want the Vice President to become the Clinic's director instead of Chief Park.

360
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:38,410
I agree with your methods of treatment.

361
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:41,760
Goodness, Dr. In, you're so emotional.

362
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,250
The cause for Dr. Lee's disciplinary action hearing

363
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:50,530
is because Dr. Lee ignored the procedures of the hospital

364
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:53,840
and used the podcast to taint the reputation of the hospital.

365
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,930
If the cause of this disciplinary action hearing changes, so will the public's confidence in the hearing.

366
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:01,450
I'll be leaving first.

367
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,090
Let's all drink.

368
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,140
Did you drink?

369
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,720
I'm a bit drunk for the first time in a while.

370
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,860
Then you should go home and rest. Why are you here?

371
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:44,090
Before, if I came here drunk, you used to make me ramen.

372
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:45,800
Wow... Ji Young Won has changed.

373
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,000
Why are you suddenly complaining about ramen?

374
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,960
Do you want to come in? I'll give you cup ramen.

375
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,860
Forget it. I just came to see you.

376
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:05,820
Young Won, do you feel awkward around me now?

377
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:13,170
It's not awkward, but now there are more things for me to think about.

378
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:17,210
That makes things very difficult.

379
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,160
What?

380
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:24,810
Ji Young Won's charm is being simple and straightforward, but you'll become too serious if you think a lot.

381
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:37,640
Young Won, regardless of how you feel,

382
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:43,850
I will just keep liking you, like I've done so far.

383
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:48,540
If you're going to keep liking me regardless of how I feel, why did you confess?

384
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:56,230
Should I have kept it a secret until the end?

385
00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:01,820
I really... this is my problem. In the end, I can't hide things.

386
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,890
So stop acting so strong all the time.

387
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,730
I've never told you about my mom, have I?

388
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,070
I heard she passed away.

389
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,440
What kind of person was she?

390
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:25,610
She was very strong. She even ran insurance scams so I could go to school.

391
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,830
- Really? 
 - Yup.

392
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,850
She was very bold.

393
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:37,350
For a mother like that, I wanted to do everything.

394
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,650
But there's one thing I couldn't do for her.

395
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:44,100
What is that?

396
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,410
First place.

397
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:50,750
The people who say things like "I'm hurting",

398
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:54,490
'This is difficult', 'I can't do this',

399
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:57,810
'I'm envious', 'I'm jealous'.

400
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:01,590
I'm most envious of people who say that in the entire world.

401
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:04,390
In Dong Hyuk is an idiot.

402
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,900
I must really be drunk.

403
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:14,960
I'll get going before I say more drunk things.

404
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,740
Shall I call a taxi for you?

405
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:22,590
It's okay.

406
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:47,000
Kong Ji, I'm sorry.

407
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,600
I'm sorry.

408
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,780
Ji Sun, I'm a b*tch.

409
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:02,410
No matter how angry I was,

410
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,940
I shouldn't have done that to you.

411
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,140
I shouldn't have said that to you.

412
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:12,270
What could I do to make you feel better? Do you want to hit me?

413
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,750
I'm going crazy.

414
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,890
Why did I say those things?

415
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,280
Ji Sun, I-

416
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,840
Argh! What do I say? I'm going crazy.

417
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,160
You're already closing?

418
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,560
Something really angered me today.

419
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,390
It's not tasty if I cook in a bad mood.

420
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,400
That's good.

421
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:51,190
- What is? 
 - I am also very angry right now.

422
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:57,160
♫  Won't you go see the stars with me?  ♫

423
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,460
I thought that I hadn't given up the cello,

424
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,520
♫  Anywhere is fine  ♫

425
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:08,970
but chosen cooking instead.

426
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:13,370
But today I felt very extremely that wasn't the case.

427
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,310
Well, to be honest I had already known it,

428
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,580
but I had been very good at hiding it.

429
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,020
You don't know this, do you?

430
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:27,390
That your meal is stronger than any drug.

431
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:30,170
Spoken like a true psychiatrist.

432
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:34,540
Do you know you're super similar to Dr. Lee sometimes?

433
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:40,790
I try my best to really be like Dr. Lee, but I've still got a long ways to go.

434
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,270
Why are you angry today?

435
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,780
Dr. Lee is facing a hearing for disciplinary action.

436
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:57,230
- Why? 
 -Dr. Lee tried with all his might to save a person who was determined to die,

437
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,380
but the hospital can't stand that.

438
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,230
I don't know what's right.

439
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,050
Everything is going crazy.

440
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:12,150
More people are getting sick because the world is going crazy.

441
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,900
But what should I do?

442
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,360
I feel like I keep liking you more and more.

443
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,460
You're crazy.

444
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:57,770
 Si Joon, it's me. Your father.

445
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:02,760
 By the time you hear this, I either won't be in this world

446
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:08,420
 or my dementia will have become so bad that it'll be as if I'm no longer a part of this world.
