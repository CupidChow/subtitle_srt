1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,440

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,550
Good morning!

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,650
I think you've lost some weight. Are you not eating well?

4
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,310
These days, I just have no appetite. I don't even want water.

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,760
Your medication has increased. Do you still see hallucinations at night?

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,980
Not recently.

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,740
Then I'll decrease the amount of medication you're taking.

8
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,880
And... This will help the bitter taste in your mouth.

9
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,570
Thanks.

10
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,850
How are you feeling today?

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,410
Not good?

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,600
- Young Seok. 
 - Yes?

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,150
After your rounds, go on a walk with him. It seems he  finds it a bit stuffy.

14
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,030
Okay, I'll do that.

15
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,190
I heard you slept at the taco shop again?

16
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,640
This crazy bastard.

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,540
Hey!

18
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,950
I'm already pissed enough as it is, what the hell are you all doing?

19
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,750
Jeez, if only I could I would replace all of you!

20
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,760
- Sons of b*tches... 
 - You're already done?

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,640
Well, seeing that you're swearing less, it seems you've gotten a lot better.

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,710
- Dr. Noh, 
 - Yes?

23
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:19,620
If the patient wants, teach him some new swear words. It's always the same.

24
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,410
I understand.

25
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,470
Jang Yu Mi. What were you doing earlier? Are you scared of the patient?

26
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,330
If you're scared of the patients, don't go on rounds.

27
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,210
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,790
Don't participate in rounds this week.

29
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,580
Okay. That's your punishment.

30
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,110
I understand...

31
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:43,470
Doctor, Kang Yeon Hee, he's a repeat offender.

32
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,910
He kept asking Dr. In to take a walk yesterday during his rounds.

33
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,860
Let's just let him off the hook.

34
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,060
 Petition for Nurse's Working System Reformation

35
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,140
Wow, you got so many!

36
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,090
We basically got the signatures of every nurse except for the ones that were off yesterday.

37
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,490
If we go for 2 more days, I think we can get everyone's signatures.

38
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,440
Great work.

39
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,810
Dr. Lee, the Vice President caught us with it.

40
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,990
That's fine. This isn't something we need to hide.

41
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:19,210
I used to think you weren't all that great, but now my opinion of you has changed.

42
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:23,490
Nurse Oh, you really are very honest.

43
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,210
- Will you be okay? 
 - What do you mean?

44
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:29,580
I'm worried this might be dangerous for you.

45
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,340
Oh my, now you're worrying about me?

46
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,110
Thank you.

47
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,040
Ms. Han Woo Joo?

48
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,960
Hello.

49
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,900
Can you spare me some time?

50
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,160
I only have 10 minutes.

51
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,710
If I don't make it to my appointment on time, Dr. Lee will be upset.

52
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,820
Oh, I see. 10 minutes is plenty.

53
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,320
Okay then! Please tell me what is it.

54
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:20,100
Um... I want to treat you, Ms. Woo Joo.

55
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,580
Me? Why?

56
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:28,650
Well... since you've been such a large help to our department

57
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:33,640
and I'm a little invested.

58
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,760
Is it because of Dr. Lee Si Joon?

59
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,530
I guess I can't say it's not because of that.

60
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,830
Can I... think about it a little bit and call you?

61
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,470
Yes, of course.

62
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,810
Okay. I'll let you know.

63
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,360
Alright.

64
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,030
Why that expression? Is something on your mind?

65
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:36,870
Dr. Lee... Am I allowed to be this happy?

66
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,380
You must really be happy these days.

67
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,390
The happiest.

68
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,730
Because of me?

69
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:51,220
Sometimes you're quite shameless. It's cute.

70
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,330
What? C-Cute?

71
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,440
I want to raise you.

72
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,590
Now I'm going to teach students at the academy,

73
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:09,870
pick a song for the choir, and even dating you.

74
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,010
Can someone like me be doing all these things?

75
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,100
What's so wrong about you?

76
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,840
Are you uneasy again?

77
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,120
I took out my personal microscope to examine my heart.

78
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,620
- And? 
 - I am uneasy.

79
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,120
But it's different from last time.

80
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,490
It's not because I'm afraid you'll leave me,

81
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,490
but because I'm afraid you'll get hurt.

82
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,400
Why would I get hurt? How?

83
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,760
Jee Hee found out.

84
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,770
What's so funny?

85
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,850
- It's not just Jee Hee, but everyone else knows as well. 
 - What?

86
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:56,040
So... we're publicly dating.

87
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,280
But are you really okay?

88
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,550
I'm not going to hide you away.

89
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,660
Wow... My heart just skipped a beat.

90
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,110
Wow. Oh my, what should I do?

91
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,960
Goodness. My heart is beating so fast.

92
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,980
Ms. Woo Joo, you're so consistently frank.

93
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:27,360
But... have you ever felt something weird physically?

94
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,820
For example?

95
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,350
Well, maybe your head feels light, or you have difficulty breathing,

96
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,290
or you develop anger that you can't identify the cause of.

97
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,370
I don't simply have intermittent explosive disorder, do I?

98
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,580
No disease in the world is a 'simple' disease.

99
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,630
One moment, please.

100
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,270
Yes?

101
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,710
I understand. I'll be right there.

102
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,920
Ms. Woo Joo, I have to go meet my father. I'll end the consultation here.

103
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,980
I'll go with you.

104
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,660
Can I?

105
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,850
Okay, let's go.

106
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,670
How many years did you work together with Nurse Heo?

107
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,440
I was Nurse Heo's preceptor.

108
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,860
I've worked with Nurse Heo ever since she started working.

109
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,040
Then it's been about, 3 years?

110
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:41,450
The hospital is thinking of giving compensation to Nurse Heo's family.

111
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:47,280
- We were wondering who should deliver it, and thought it would be good for you to. 
 - Me?

112
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,890
You can also extend your apology at this opportunity.

113
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,380
What do you think?

114
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,960
Are you implying that Nurse Heo died because of me?

115
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:02,060
I'm not trying to pin blame right now. Is that important?

116
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:07,430
With good intentions, if you apologize when giving them compensation,

117
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,150
don't you think they'll feel a bit more at ease, too?

118
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,970
You're really all too much.

119
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,650
It wasn't me.

120
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,030
I didn't do that.

121
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,720
Tell Chief Park to come as well.

122
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,870
I think the reporters will be here soon.

123
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,860
I understand.

124
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,080
Wait a minute.

125
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,420
Nurse Na?

126
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,060
- What happened? 
 - I just met with the Hospital Director.

127
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,480
She told me to go apologize to Nurse Heo's family and deliver the hospital's compensation.

128
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,070
What?

129
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,120
You told me not to worry. You said I would be fine.

130
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,810
I've been turned into a killer. What's fine about that?

131
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,010
I see, I'll try to do whatever I can to figure something out.

132
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:09,800
What are you going to do? I've totally been marked already.

133
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,040
The Hospital Director called me herself.

134
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:17,730
I can't even go to a different hospital or do anything.

135
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:31,220
It looks like something serious. Will she be okay?

136
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,720
Ms. Woo Joo, can you wait for me just a little bit.

137
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,860
Yes. Don't worry about me and take care of what you need to.

138
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:43,230
Nurse Jung, you have the Petition for Nurse's Working System Reformation, don't you?

139
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,090
Does it make sense to call a nurse who's been working for 5 years

140
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,760
and tell her to go apologize to Nurse Heo's family?

141
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,330
Someone has to apologize to her family!

142
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,190
The hospital should be apologizing.

143
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,330
Then should I go myself?

144
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,460
Nurse Heo was not only a nurse at our hospital, but a patient.

145
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,300
Despite this, our hospital hasn't even made a space to put flowers in her memory.

146
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,080
Acting like this isn't like you.

147
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:20,710
It's the most like me to think of the hospital's image above all else.

148
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:24,500
I'll go and apologize.

149
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,450
If you're going to do that, then quit working here first.

150
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,070
Nurse Heo's family is filing for civil action.

151
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:36,670
At first, she was going to sue some independent practitioner, but now, she's going to sue our hospital instead.

152
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,980
They must have gotten a lot of evidence that Nurse Heo was bullied.

153
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:44,920
We can't just stand here and watch our hospital's name get thrown around in the media.

154
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,330
If we sacrifice one person, we can save the entire hospital!

155
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,110
Vice President, how could you-

156
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:53,270
Aren't you worried that Nurse Na may also make extreme decisions if things go wrong?

157
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:57,160
If that happens, the hospital's image won't even be salvageable!

158
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:29,440
I can just tell by your expression that you're sad.

159
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,230
I'm sorry.

160
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,330
Don't worry. I can fix it.

161
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:11,120
What kind of person was your father? When I saw him last time, he seemed like a doctor.

162
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,030
My father was an exceptional surgeon.

163
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:20,740
- Thanks to that, I always felt inadequate. 
 - Oh no.

164
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:26,220
I'm curious what my father will say when he meets you.

165
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,750
Father, I'm here.

166
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,990
Honey.

167
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,750
Why did you take so long?

168
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,350
Do you know how much I looked for you?

169
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:17,830
Father, this isn't Mom,

170
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,110
but Ms. Han Woo Joo.

171
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,230
Hello.

172
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:26,660
Honey... You were really angry at me, right?

173
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,210
Uh... Father...

174
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,510
It's okay.

175
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,090
I'm sorry that I took so long.

176
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:45,420
My wife has become so young and pretty.

177
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,560
Thank you.

178
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:55,660
I've really missed you.

179
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,840
I regret letting you leave like that

180
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,230
when you asked for a divorce.

181
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:08,570
After I sent you away like that, I was in a lot of pain.

182
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,980
Si Joon hurt a lot, too.

183
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:16,950
But I... hit Si Joon every time he looked for his mom.

184
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,880
I hated my own son.

185
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,740
Because I thought of you every time I saw him.

186
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,040
Si Joon suffered a lot because of me.

187
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,170
He's my own son, but I didn't want to see him.

188
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:44,380
He's my own son, but I could never say a kind word to him or hug him.

189
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,360
Father...

190
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,310
I feel so sorry for my son.

191
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,760
You asked me to raise him well.

192
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,990
But I was wrong. I'm sorry.

193
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:17,670
We can just live well from now on, right?

194
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:20,430
Yes, of course.

195
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,200
You can live well from now.

196
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,490
Who are you?

197
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,350
Oh, you're the doctor, right?

198
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:44,450
Who are you, Miss? Are you also a doctor?

199
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:53,970
Doctor... I don't think I have very many days left to live.

200
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:01,060
We'll... take care of you well.

201
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:10,030
Doctor... Don't call my son.

202
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:17,600
Even if I die, don't call him.

203
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,560
Why not?

204
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,880
Because he will be sad.

205
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,020
I hate it the most when my son cries.

206
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,510
Your father asked me to give you this.

207
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:49,300
I think he recorded the things he wanted to say to you whenever his mind was clear.

208
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:59,300
You should visit him often. His condition is getting worse exponentially.

209
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,760
As all of his functionality declines,

210
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,410
he may not even be able to speak the next time you see him.

211
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:12,260
I understand.

212
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,930
Ms. Woo Joo.

213
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,710
- One moment please.
 - Yes.

214
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,680
I'll be back.

215
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:16,590
My father wanted me to become a doctor like him.

216
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:22,180
When I told him I was going to become a psychiatrist, he hit me.

217
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,650
Goodness...

218
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:30,510
Even after I went to medical school and started training,

219
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,830
"Are you Dr. Lee Taek Kyung's son?"

220
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,290
"You have such an incredible father."

221
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,790
Everyone else respected him,

222
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,810
but I couldn't understand him.

223
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:56,500
That's why I became a psychiatrist. To try to understand my father.

224
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:00,660
So did you understand him?

225
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:08,610
I understood... once my father got sick.

226
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:21,440
Now that I've met your father, I think I can start looking for my mom.

227
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,540
I can help you.

228
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm so happy I have you.

229
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,110
What about you?

230
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,280
Why are you asking when you already know the answer?

231
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,470
- Ms. Woo Joo. 
 - Yes?

232
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:52,120
Even up until recently, I exercised every day and night.

233
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,990
♫  The endlessly dark evening road is narrow and far.  ♫

234
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:58,210
Exercise increases the levels of serotonin

235
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:02,160
and dopamine in your body, which alleviates depression.

236
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,060
♫  I'll be there for you,  ♫

237
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:09,660
But now I feel the dopamine by just looking at your face.

238
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,160
♫  It'll all be okay,   ♫

239
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,650
♫  so don't worry.  ♫

240
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:19,170
Now, even without exercising, I can live.

241
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:35,080
♫  I love you.  ♫

242
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,610
♫   I have since the beginning.   ♫

243
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:50,160
♫  Waiting for you and looking at you, like this.  ♫

244
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:56,810
♫   I am the most grateful for that.   ♫

245
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:10,110
Hello, sir. Are you looking for anything in particular?

246
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:15,240
No. I just saw you while passing by.

247
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:24,120
The Hospital Director and Chief Park got into a big argument just now.

248
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:29,270
- About what? 
 - Nurse Heo's family is filing a lawsuit against the hospital.

249
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,560
I see...

250
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,740
Like you said, I'll be able to blow my nose without using my hands. 
 (Expression meaning find a solution without doing anything)

251
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,970
Don't you think they'll reconcile soon?

252
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:41,930
That's why we need to make sure that doesn't happen.

253
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,030
I understand.

254
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:46,160
Just you wait. The second I become the Center's Director,

255
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:51,400
Chief Park and Lee Si Joon won't be able to place even a foot inside.

256
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,060
All of his residents, too.

257
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,550
If Chief Park doesn't become the new clinic's director,

258
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:01,240
Si Joon will naturally not try to enter the new mental health hospital.

259
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,060
I'll see you.

260
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,540
- Dr. In. 
 - Yes, where is he?

261
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:37,260
Over there. We just completed pumping his stomach.

262
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:54,250
Kang Jin Ho. I know you're not sleeping.

263
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,400
Explain it to me.

264
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,190
It's testing season soon, but I was so sleepy even when I took the medication.

265
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:07,400
I must've taken too many at once.

266
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,990
You promised me you wouldn't take those pills because I said I would keep your secret from your mom. Did you forget?

267
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:16,610
I'm sorry. I couldn't do anything about it.

268
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:19,470
I got second place again.

269
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:25,500
You can't tell my mom, okay? Then I'll really be done for.

270
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,060
You'll actually die if you keep this up.

271
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:37,200
They are finished with the emergency treatment, so once he stabilizes, have him released.

272
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,990
You're just going to let him go? Is he not going to be hospitalized?

273
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:45,600
Dr. In. It's already Kang Jin Ho's third visit. Shouldn't we be hospitalizing him? I think he's addicted to his pills.

274
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,880
What if something happens after we let him go like this?

275
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,460
I know Kang Jin Ho well. Let him go for now.

276
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,080
Sunbae, don't we need to hospitalize him?

277
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,540
Just do as Dr. In says.

278
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,570
 Nurse Na Sun Kyeong

279
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:20,690
Hello?

280
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:25,060
Dr. Lee, I feel like this is so unfair.

281
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,190
It's so unfair,

282
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:32,310
that I just want to die.

283
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:38,240
I'm going to write everything in my will and die, like Heo Min Young.

284
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,010
When I die, I'm never going to Eun Kang Hospital.

285
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,700
And no one there can come to my funeral.

286
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,560
Nurse Na, where are you? I'll go to where you are.

287
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,210
 Nurse Na - call ended

288
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,590
Nurse Na.

289
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:58,120
Nurse Na?

290
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,290
What should we do?

291
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,770
 Cha Dong Il

292
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,280
- Yes, Dr. Lee. 
 - Dong Il.

293
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,620
Remember Ms. Na Sun Kyeong, the ICU Nurse?

294
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,660
Yes, I understand. I'll look for her right away.

295
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,780
Yes.

296
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,610
Chief,

297
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:33,710
I got a report of someone planning a suicide.

298
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,070
What?

299
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,390
What should we do?

300
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:14,880

301
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,260
We'll be able to find her, right?

302
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,080
We have to.

303
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,800
Is there no way to contact her?

304
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,060
There's one way.

305
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,940
What is it?

306
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:04,260
♫  If I had known you a little better.  ♫

307
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,190
♫  No, if I had loved you a little more.  ♫

308
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,720
 Did you have to do that?

309
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,290
 Begin disciplinary action against Lee Si Joon.

310
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:15,500
 Until the disciplinary action is complete, you can't accept any new patients.

311
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,890
 Mom! What's wrong?

312
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:19,380
 Why did that person suddenly call you?

313
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:23,740
 During our consultation, her emotions started getting stronger and she suddenly had a panic attack.

314
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,250
 Do you know my diagnosis?

315
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,750
 Dr. Lee, I made a big mistake...

316
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,360
 It would've been good if you were just a little bit of a bad person.

317
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,030
 Dr. In, can you testify about Lee Si Joon and Han Woo Joo's relationship?

318
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:39,630
♫  I miss you.  ♫
