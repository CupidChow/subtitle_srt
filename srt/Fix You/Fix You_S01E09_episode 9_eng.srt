1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,840

2
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:23,680

3
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,010
 I've never thought that I wanted to die.

4
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,460
 I've actually always wanted to survive.

5
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,060
 This was just... me trying to get some attention.

6
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,090
 I didn't even do it with a knife.

7
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,320
 I was scared it would hurt, so I did it with a ruler. A plastic ruler.

8
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,030
 That's not the problem right now!

9
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,840
 Hurry up and take my blood!

10
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,410
 Take my blood right now! Hurry!

11
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,360
 You were right, doctor.

12
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,420
 I'm a patient.

13
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,670

14
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:53,570
Recently I...

15
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,400
started liking someone.

16
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,850
Really? Congratulations!

17
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,730
I want to confess to her,

18
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:02,320
but my hea—

19
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,740
my habit of shaking my head isn't that great.

20
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,250
So I want to hurry up and get better.

21
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,710
How are you going to confess?

22
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,100
Can you try listening to it?

23
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,900
Should I? Try it.

24
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,070
Oh gosh, I'm nervous.

25
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,910
I won't beat around the bush.

26
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,930
Will you date me?

27
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,790
That's all?

28
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,400
What do you think of my— my confession?

29
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,180
Well... it's short and sweet.

30
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,360
I think it'll be a success!

31
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,220
Really?

32
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:54,940
Then... you should give me a response.

33
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,020
Come on, now.

34
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,270
Okay then, I'll wait a bit.

35
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,910
Take care.

36
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,540
Si Joon.

37
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,790
Why did you send Han Woo Joo to me?

38
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,480
You knew from the beginning but sent her anyway, didn't you?

39
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,180
Why did you do that?

40
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,550
I couldn't stand watching you live like that.

41
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,660
How do I live?

42
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,640
You don't exist in your life. You live for your patients.

43
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,930
Like you say, you run around all day and night because of that incident 8 years ago.

44
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,240
I sent Woo Joo to you as a doctor who concluded that you are a patient with PTSD.

45
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,120
She was my way of treating you.

46
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,290
Who told you to give me treatment as you please?

47
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,690
I want you to be able to free yourself from that incident.

48
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,660
So you're—

49
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,900
Why?

50
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:19,300
You're right. I have PTSD.

51
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:24,440
I haven't been able to overcome the shock from that incident 8 years ago.

52
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,510
Whenever I see a patient with borderline personality disorder, I get reminded of that incident,

53
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,830
and I want to avoid them at all costs.

54
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,370
Until when are you going to run away?

55
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,760
You're punishing yourself right now.

56
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,580
You have no thoughts of trying to get better.

57
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,420
Since Han Woo Joo

58
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,700
was your patient,

59
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,070
take her back.

60
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,280
Now that I know she has BPD (borderline personality disorder),

61
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,260
I don't think I can treat her.

62
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,860
Are you really a doctor?

63
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,460
Are you really a psychiatrist?

64
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,790
I got a big wake-up call

65
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,540
from that BPD patient.

66
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:43,440
One incident like that is enough.

67
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,540
If you let Han Woo Joo go like this, you can't call yourself a doctor.

68
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,170
You can't even call yourself human. I won't see you anymore.

69
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,320
 Do I look pretty?

70
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,270
 What? What did you say?

71
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,930
 That horrible wretch.

72
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,990
 That cruel wretch.

73
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,800
 You were really the worst.

74
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,110
 On that day, you killed me too.

75
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,740
He just ignored me and left, I was so flustered.

76
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,130
Hey, how could a person change so suddenly like that?

77
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,430
Dr. Lee is probably in the worst mood today.

78
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,630
That's why he was like that.

79
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:05,210
The chief gave him a punishment. No appointments.

80
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,650
Does that mean he can't take any patients?

81
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,960
Dr. Lee is a total work addict.

82
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,940
He probably feels like he's lost the world.

83
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,540
Is this all because of that? The search and seizure?

84
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,650
Of course.

85
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:20,790
Goodness, who made that kind of report?

86
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:36,160
By the way, do you remember the anorexia patient who got theatrical therapy last time, Hwang Bo Young?

87
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,220
She... quit treatment.

88
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,150
Is it because of me?

89
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,940
- Because of the things I said? 
 - It's not because of you,

90
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,000
but it's true Dr. Lee has been down since then.

91
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,420
Dr. Lee has been going through a lot lately.

92
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,710
Can you be understanding of that?

93
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,920
It's because of me.

94
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,270
I was the problem. It was me.

95
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,000
I didn't even know that.

96
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,660
What should I do, I feel so bad?

97
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,350
Oh my gosh...

98
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,980
Unnie!

99
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,780
How do you feel about tricking a naive doctor so you could go out and drink?

100
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,200
Do you feel like you're living now?

101
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,500
Thanks to you, we feel like dying.

102
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,170
Why are you nagging me so much?

103
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,610
Hurry up and change your clothes.

104
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,820
I'm going to get discharged.

105
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,720
Suddenly?

106
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,040
Don't try to keep me here against my will.

107
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,580
If you keep me here,

108
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,960
you guys will get another investigation.

109
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:50,890
Sure. If you say you want to get discharged, we have to let you go.

110
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,820
But you have to sober up first.

111
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,790
You can't go today anyway, so please change.

112
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,890
For goodness’ sake!

113
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,660
I can only change if you leave.

114
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,640
Hey! I knew you would pull something like this.

115
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:23,230
Give it back. That's mine! That's my alcohol! It's mine!

116
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,320
Give it back! Give it back!

117
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,650
Hey!

118
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,980
- Nurse Oh! 
 - Give it back!

119
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,660
Are you okay?

120
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:37,280
Let go! Won't you let go! I'm going to report this!

121
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,510
I'm going to report you all!

122
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,170
 The person you are trying to call...

123
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,230
I can't reach Dr. Lee.

124
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:55,420
Patient Kim Young Sun is your patient. You can decide whether or not to let her be discharged.

125
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,470
That's true,

126
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,710
but I'm not sure if it's right to let her go given the circumstances.

127
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:06,050
I want to wait to hear Dr. Lee's opinion.

128
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,920
At first, she was Dr. Lee's patient.

129
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,790
Like she said, because she's a patient that admitted herself,

130
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:14,840
we have to let her get discharged if she wants to.

131
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,040
We cannot keep her here against her will.

132
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,870
Right now, she's threatening to report us to the Human Rights Institution.

133
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,780
What are you thinking about? Just call him.

134
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,040
What if he doesn't pick up?

135
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,500
If he's busy, then that's possible.

136
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,080
I think he's really angry.

137
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,860
At you? Really?

138
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,040
He's not a petty person like that.

139
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,180
I really wanted to get along well with Dr. Lee Si Joon.

140
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,270
Am I the type of woman that men get tired of quickly?

141
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:56,810
He's not a man, but a doctor.

142
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,450
You don't have other intentions in mind, right?

143
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,900
What other intentions?

144
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,650
I mean...

145
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,080
I just think you're more worried than you should be.

146
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,090
He's not my type.

147
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,870
You've always been the type to fall in love quick.

148
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,690
Hey, who's that lady?

149
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,820
Why does she keep doing that in front of my store?

150
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,310
She's a patient from the hospital.

151
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,510
What kind of patient?

152
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,440
She looks a bit drunk.

153
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,460
She's an alcoholic.

154
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:58,140
She claims to know who the informant is, and told us to give her a drink if we wanted to know.

155
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,670
Han Woo Joo was convinced by her.

156
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:05,000
I heard that lady got discharged today. Is it really okay for her to drink like that?

157
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,430
Oh my goodness. Take the alcohol away from her! Quickly!

158
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:14,430
Why is Woo Joo being like this? She'll get into big trouble!

159
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,600
Unnie,

160
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,070
do you really know who the informant is?

161
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:25,460
I mean, you said you would tell me after just one drink. How many bottles have you gone through now?

162
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,920
The informant is

163
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,100
someone in the hospital.

164
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,490
Is it a patient?

165
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,260
A doctor.

166
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,380
- Really? 
 - Wait, my glass is empty.

167
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,570
Please leave now.

168
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,940
Can you be acting like this when you got discharged today? You have to stop, too.

169
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,790
Hey! She says the informant is a doctor.

170
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,480
Which doctor?

171
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,910
She's just putting on an act to get alcohol.

172
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,750
Where do you live? I'll call a taxi for you.

173
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,020
I don't have a home.

174
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,430
Then do you want to go back to the hospital? Should I call them?

175
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,170
Are you belittling me?

176
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:05,630
Why would I go back to the hospital?

177
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,940
If you want to know who the informant is, bring me more alcohol.

178
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:15,310
Nope. This is no good. I won't give you any more until you tell me who the informant is.

179
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:21,900
If you won't bring me any, I'll just go get more myself. I can go get it.

180
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,650
Unnie?

181
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:34,100
You can't sleep here.

182
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,310
Who's the informant? Huh?

183
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,430
Can you wake up?

184
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,430
Hey! Hey!  Unnie?

185
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:46,410
What should we do?

186
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,980
She's not breathing! What should we do?

187
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,070
What?

188
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:54,750
Unnie? Unnie?

189
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,500
- Hello? 
 - Si Joon...

190
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,400
Cut.

191
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,050
Cut.

192
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,390
Cut...

193
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,970
It's a great day to save lives.

194
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,140
Cut.

195
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,090
Cut.

196
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,930
Hey, it's you! The new guy.

197
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,680
You have an operation?

198
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,720
You catch on fast. Sure, I'll let you in on it.

199
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,860
It's a liver transplant and colectomy, so it'll be quite the surgery.

200
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,940
It's an honor.

201
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,960
When is the operation?

202
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,280
Tomorrow.

203
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:56,660
Oh, this surgery is in Seoul.

204
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,220
At the hospital where my son works.

205
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:07,620
Wow! Will you be meeting your son then?

206
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,190
What good would seeing that punk do?

207
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,420
Why won't you?

208
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,160
You're going to the hospital where he works.

209
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:20,910
I told you he's stupid. He and I are like water and oil.

210
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:30,340
That's similar to me. My father and I are also like water and oil.

211
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,030
How so?

212
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,480
I just can't converse with him.

213
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:41,940
He's stubborn, looks down on others, and thinks he's the best in the world.

214
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,240
He was so much to handle, even my mother ran away.

215
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:55,460
My father... didn't know how to smile.

216
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,730
The only memory I have of my father

217
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,060
is when he was hitting me.

218
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:08,190
It hurt me so much to get hit by my father.

219
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,950
Do you know what method I came up with to cope?

220
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:16,730
I had to think about him objectively. I wonder what kind of person he is.

221
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,870
I wonder what kind of life he's lived.

222
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,180
I wonder what he thinks while he hits his son.

223
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,010
The only thing

224
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:40,270
that my father passed down to me was poverty.

225
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:46,360
I didn't want to pass down poverty to my son.

226
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:51,070
The best inheritance that I could pass down to my son

227
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:55,250
was my medical knowledge.

228
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:00,580
That's why I wanted him to become a surgeon like you.

229
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:10,750
Are you remembering everything right now?

230
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,610
This pathetic punk!

231
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:17,810
Why are you still keeping things of the past in your heart?

232
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,400
Father...

233
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,190
- Dr. Lee? 
 - My princess!

234
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:31,500
You haven't ever seen my princess, have you? This is my attending.

235
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,560
What are you still doing here? Hurry up and go.

236
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,730
Go. Go.

237
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:44,430
It's taking off! Yay!

238
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,900
Okay, another one!

239
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,710
I've never seen my father laugh like that.

240
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,450
Loving someone has been helping him a lot.

241
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,640
He doesn't shout as much as he used to.

242
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,820
Today, his mentality was wandering back and forth.

243
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,940
These days, his mind frequently wanders.

244
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,780
As you known, dementia doesn't mean

245
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:15,280
that you've lost your consciousness until the day you die.

246
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,410
Oh my goodness!

247
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,960
 Thank you.

248
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,940
Are you leaving now?

249
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,950
Yes.

250
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:52,210
Go and prepare for the surgery. I'll be right there.

251
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,140
Alright, doctor.

252
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,940
Oh right, and be careful of driving at night.

253
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,030
Yes.

254
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,010
Oh, and...

255
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:07,250
- is he doing okay? 
 - Who?

256
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,450
The returnee.

257
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,720
Who?

258
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,780
Park Ru Oh!

259
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:21,580
If you can't respond to my questions like that in the operating room, I'll kick you out on the spot.

260
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:39,500
- Hello? 
 - Dr. Lee, where are you? I think you need to come to the hospital.

261
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,620
Why? Is there a problem?

262
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,010
Patient Kim Young Sun, who was getting treated for alcoholism,

263
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:49,690
got discharged earlier this afternoon. She was just wheeled in with acute alcohol poisoning.

264
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:53,650
- How is she? 
 - A blood test indicated that her blood alcohol level is 0.3%. She's in danger.

265
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,280
What?

266
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have let her go.

267
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:08,960

268
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:16,370
Gosh, why did I give her the alcohol? Why am I like this?

269
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,060

270
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,690

271
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:34,240
She got acute alcohol intoxication due to alcoholic hepatitis and sudden binge drinking.

272
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,730
We just completed a blood test and abdominal ultrasound.

273
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,070
To help the decomposition of alcohol, we are injecting her with a glucose solution.

274
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,500
Is she conscious?

275
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,100
Yes.

276
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:46,960
I heard she was sober for 6 months.

277
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,560
She should've controlled herself a bit more.

278
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,970
Alcoholism isn't something you can fix with endurance.

279
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,480

280
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,380
Her symptoms of alcoholic hepatitis got worse,

281
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,430
so we've decided to have her get treatment from the neurology department.

282
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,730
Why did this patient suddenly get discharged?

283
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:52,460
She left the hospital and drank because of my mistake.

284
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,510
I'm sorry.

285
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,250
She was a patient who admitted herself,

286
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,760
and the nurses were so adamant on her being discharged. There was nothing I could do.

287
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,070
Once the neurological tests are complete, readmit her.

288
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,180
Yes, sir.

289
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,580
I'll start off by cleansing her system of the alcohol, and prescribe her some medication.

290
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:09,010
But... won't that patient say they don't want to be admitted?

291
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,180
We can contact their guardian.

292
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:15,730
Dr. Lee, patient Kim Young Sun doesn't have a guardian.

293
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:20,300
After she became an alcoholic, she said she wasn't in contact with her family.

294
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,350
I think since she's already intoxicated, we should let her go

295
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:27,270
and readmit her once she's reached rock bottom again.

296
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:32,560
Once an alcoholic patient starts drinking, there's no way to stop them.

297
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,830
How did she come to the emergency room? Didn't her family members call?

298
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,220
About that, Ms. Han Woo Joo brought her.

299
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,390
How?

300
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,800
They were drinking together when patient Kim fainted.

301
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,010
What?

302
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,760
Han Woo Joo is a total troublemaker.

303
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,880
Last time, patient Hwang Bo Young said she would stop getting treatment because of her.

304
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,640
That's not true.

305
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,900
Why is that patient deciding not to get treatment because of Han Woo Joo?

306
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,110
Patient Kim Young Sun wouldn't have drank if I had kept her from leaving the hospital.

307
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,580
She got acute alcohol intoxication and alcoholic hepatitis while she was drinking with Han Woo Joo.

308
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,160
It's not like Woo Joo forced the alcohol down patient Kim's throat!

309
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:08,650
What are you guys doing in front of Dr. Lee?

310
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,760
I'm sorry.

311
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,820
Why are you stopping them? Keep going.

312
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,380
I'm sorry.

313
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,750
I looked through Ru Oh's files. They were helpful.

314
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,070
Why are you thanking me for something like that?

315
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:36,910
I'll start with a psychological consultation so that the change isn't so sudden for Ru Oh.

316
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:41,160
Sure. Since he's your patient now, do as you please.

317
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,210
I heard you met Young Won.

318
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,400
She's worried a lot about you.

319
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:52,140
You knew about Han Woo Joo too, right?

320
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,690
Yes. I was aware.

321
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:58,060
So what? Do you want to grab my collar again?

322
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,690
I call a jerk like you my friend.

323
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:04,330
You don't think about Young Won at all, do you?

324
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,190
Do you think I've pretended I didn't know for your sake?

325
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:16,200
I did it for Young Won.

326
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,210
I should have told Young Won.

327
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,770
Can you please take a look at Young Won's intent?

328
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:27,350
Why do you think Young Won would have done something like that?

329
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,610

330
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,830

331
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,680

332
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,660
 He's ignoring my calls and my texts.

333
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,300
 He must really be angry.

334
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:02,110
 Fine then. I'll pretend like I don't know you either.

335
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,410
Ms. Han Woo Joo.

336
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:28,690
 He's... calling... my... name.

337
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,510
You knew about Kim Young Sun's alcoholism, right?

338
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,170
I've met her once during theatrical therapy.

339
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:52,480
Something really bad could've happened to her.

340
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,040
Because she drank so much alcohol so suddenly after being sober,

341
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:59,720
she almost died when she fainted from alcoholic hepatitis.

342
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,040
- What sho— 
 - You knew she was a patient with alcoholism.

343
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,590
Why did you drink with her?

344
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:10,530
I mean, I thought— She had already been discharged,

345
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,980
and she was already drunk before I met her.

346
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,280
Is her drinking my fault?

347
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,750
- I heard you drank with her. 
 - I... did drink with her, but

348
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:23,050
I didn't ask her or tell her to drink.

349
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:27,320
I only gave her a few drinks because she said she would tell me who the informant was.

350
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,140
That's why I'm asking why you're uselessly interfering.

351
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,620
Uselessly interfering?

352
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,310
You're right. I'm a meddler.

353
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:40,690
If you knew she had been admitted for addiction, you should've stopped her when she asked for drinks.

354
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:41,930
Fine!

355
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,840
I basically poured alcohol into her body!

356
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,530
It's all my fault that she fainted like that!

357
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:52,250
From now on, please don't meet with the patients personally.

358
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,730
Wow! The more I listen to this, the more unfair it seems.

359
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:00,040
Am I someone that only harms patients?

360
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,090
Do you really think that?

361
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:09,950
Is that why you ignored my calls?

362
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,770
She would have drunk alcohol even without me!

363
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:17,670
I just wanted to help you!

364
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:21,390
I did that to find out who the informant was!

365
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,160
Let's go.

366
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,330
I'm going to quit theatrical therapy.

367
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:32,030
How could someone like me who only harms patients do theatrical therapy! Isn't that right?

368
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,710
I'll quit right now. Would that work?

369
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,780
Do that, then.

370
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:40,460
I think that'd be best for both of us.

371
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:06,030
 I think that'd be best for both of us.

372
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:16,250
This horrible bastard!!

373
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,330
How could someone be like that?

374
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:27,710
Can he not distinguish between sincere words and empty ones?

375
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,690
 I just said that because I was angry!

376
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:32,260
I wanted him to just pat my back,

377
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:37,530
tell me it wasn't my fault, and encourage me. Isn't that what a psychiatrist is supposed to do?

378
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,690
He's not in his right mind right now.

379
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:42,510
What do you think? I'm right, right?

380
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:46,470
I think you're not in your right mind.

381
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,430
Hey, what should I do about him?

382
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:53,040
How can I get revenge on him? Should I make another report to the Human Rights Institution?

383
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:57,820
Couldn't something like this be considered patient abuse, too?

384
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,920
Do you think I did something useless?

385
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,620
Why do you keep repenting? What have you done wrong?

386
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:16,290
You did what you should've done as a doctor and as his friend.

387
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,770
Si Joon was more adamant than I thought he would be.

388
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:24,270
Young Won, stop worrying about Si Joon and just give up.

389
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:27,210
Do you know what I said to him?

390
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:31,630
I told him a bad doctor isn't an unskilled one, but one that gives up.

391
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:36,770
I'm not going to give up on Lee Si Joon or Han Woo Joo.

392
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:41,160
Okay. Then I guess I shouldn't give up on you either.

393
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,910
What?

394
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,180
I'm kidding. It's a joke.

395
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,420
Eat up. It's good.

396
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:19,740
 If you ever want to swear at someone, do it in here. Don't hold it in.

397
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:26,100
 Don't be the kind of bad doctors that give up midway through because it gets difficult.
