1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:07,130

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,700
Vice President Oh Ki Tae

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,050
That Dr. Lee Si Joon gave up his right to defend himself and didn't even attend the hearing

4
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,830
I believe that means he will accept any disciplinary action the committee gives him.

5
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,570
Then there's no reason to dwell on it.

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,160
Let's not drag this out and bring it to conclusion today.

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,970
I understand.

8
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,250
Vice President Oh Ki Tae

9
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,260
What I'm curious about is if this is something one can recover from.

10
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,050
Yes, you can get better if you take the time and diligently receive treatment.

11
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,190
So how long does that take?

12
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:34,300
I know everyone is different, but what's the average?

13
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,940
How many hospitals have you visited so far?

14
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,410
This is my 6th one.

15
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,340
I understand well that you are very anxious but--

16
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,860
Why do you think I got this kind of illness?

17
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,710
Is it genetic?

18
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:54,900
I looked it up and there are many cases in which the patients had problems with their mothers when they were young.

19
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,290
Is that it?

20
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:01,690
Rather than understanding your diagnosis, isn't it more important to understand yourself?

21
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,770
Can you tell me your story?

22
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,030
About your childhood, or whatever else, it's all fine.

23
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,530
My childhood.

24
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:12,990
The patient's role is very important for treatment.

25
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,500
Yes.

26
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,920
The call cannot be connected, so after the beep

27
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,420
you will be connected to voice mail.

28
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,610
Why is it turned off?

29
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,110
I guess he's busy. A phone can be turned off, no big deal.

30
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,180
Excuse me, will it be much longer?

31
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,320
Yes, it's coming.

32
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,020
It's number 5, right?

33
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,480
Enjoy your meal.

34
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,750
What? Photos?

35
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,030
So the Vice President had Dr. Lee followed?

36
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,530
It appears so.

37
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,060
I really cannot tolerate this anymore.

38
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,940
Chief? Chief?

39
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,700
If you meet with the Vice President now, you'll fight with him in reaction to your emotions.

40
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,890
How dare he conduct that kind of secret investigation on someone?

41
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,520
Oh Ki Tae was not this sort of person before.

42
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,150
Clinic Head? Is it worth acting this way?

43
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,620
You two are colleagues,

44
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,120
so how about sorting things out later over some drinks?

45
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,780
In a comfortable setting, comfortably,

46
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,940
wouldn't you both have better dialogue that way?

47
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,840
Why does this require dialogue?

48
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,060
Oh Ki Tae, why do you lead such a shameful life?

49
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,090
What? So you want to abandon rank and protocol now?

50
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,620
Before, you weren't quite this bad. Aren't you even embarrassed?

51
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,220
I'm really angry right now because of Lee Si Joon.

52
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,320
You go and be the Clinic Head, okay?

53
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,730
Let me personally help make sure that you get that position, okay?

54
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,470
Who are you to say if I get to be the Clinic Head or not?

55
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,790
I'm the one who made you the Vice Presidentr. You didn't know that, did you?

56
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,490
So I'm really begging you now, please become a human being.

57
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,750
- How dare you...!
- Look at this.
- Ow, it hurts.

58
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,020
Ow, ow, that hurts.

59
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,530
You're barely even a handful for me.

60
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,260
I think it's too late for you to become a human being

61
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,440
but at the very least, don't become an animal.

62
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,110
You jerk.

63
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,670
Kong Rice House

64
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,200
I'm really sorry about last time.

65
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,130
Well, it's not as if I did anything right.

66
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,720
- And you didn't say anything that was wrong.
 - No.

67
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,280
I was the one who did wrong, for sure.

68
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,580
You had a lot of reasons to get angry before, because of me.

69
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,980
My emotional ups and downs are so severe.

70
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,940
I'm really sorry, Kong Ji Sun.

71
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,510
What the heck? You seem to have changed a lot.

72
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,070
I'm going to grit my teeth and try.

73
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,430
Try so hard at what?

74
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,920
To live like other people.

75
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,600
If I explode again and we fight again

76
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,620
then can you wait for me, just for a little while?

77
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,110
Then I will reflect right away.

78
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,180
What is this? Why are you being so submissive?

79
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:02,630
Fighting with you made me feel so lonely.

80
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,810
That's why.

81
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,090
Ask the doctor to come for a meal.

82
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,780
Can I?

83
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,000
 The call cannot be connected, so after the beep you will be connected to voice mail.

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,300
He's not answering?

85
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,740
His phone has been off all day. He must be busy.

86
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,470
Then call Ji Hee and ask what Doctor is doing.

87
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,770
Oh, right, I can do that.

88
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,150
The doctor isn't at the hospital right now.

89
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:45,000
There was a disciplinary committee hearing today, and I heard that he just left earlier.

90
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,330
 The call cannot be connected, so after the beep you will be connected to voice mail.

91
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:05,640
 Wait. I shouldn't be impulsive.

92
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,830
 Calm down and let's try thinking calmly.

93
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,980
One, Dr. Si Joon had a big thing happen at the hospital.

94
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,800
Two, he came home.

95
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,390
Three, he turned his phone off, which means that he wants to be alone.

96
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:29,230
Four, is it right for me to ring his doorbell?

97
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,610
Look, he hasn't gone far away. He is home.

98
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:49,000
At times like this, just wait for him quietly.

99
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:09,380

Control your emotions.

108
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,000
Control your emotions.

109
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,290
Control. Emotions.

110
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,920
 Lee Si Joon

111
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,410
 I'm okay.

112
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,160
 I'm just taking a break.

113
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:02,930
Dr. Lee, cheer up! Heart! Heart!

114
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,540
Cheer up!

115
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,040
Dr. Lee, you are the best!

116
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,580
The best!

117
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,730
Cheer up! Fighting!

118
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,030
Probation for one month?

119
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:20,790
I really can't believe it. It would already be too much to reduce his wage, but a probation?

120
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,860
Have you spoken with Si Joon?

121
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:28,920
His phone is off. I think he may have been quite disappointed by the outcome.

122
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,400
I'm worried that he'll suddenly disappear into the ground again.

123
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,950
He wouldn't just submit a resignation form, would he?

124
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,580
I can't be sure about that either, since he's always been quite unpredictable.

125
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,270
Sunbae, I heard about Dr. Lee.

126
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,920
But isn't that really too much?

127
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,100
If he's on probation, he can't get a promotion for a year and a half, and his salary will be reduced.

128
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:13,250
Sunbae, should we... do something for Dr. Lee?

129
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,910
Shouldn't we all get together and console him or something?

130
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,470
 Today I'm heading to the academy.

131
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:28,400
 At the academy, very kind students are waiting for me.

132
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,200
 I'm quite popular there.

133
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,740
She is overflowing with energy...

134
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,040
 This is our academy! Ta-da!

135
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,720
 Today, I will also try my best!

136
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,730
 Yay!

137
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,740
 Dr. Lee, I have something to tell you about Woo Joo Unni.

138
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,580
 I've made a big mistake.

139
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,650
What is it? Why are you hesitating so much?

140
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:06,840
Dr. Lee... I've made a big mistake.

141
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,520
I told Woo Joo that she has borderline personality disorder.

142
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,350
- What? 
 - I had no choice because she said she would go to a different hospital to find out if I didn't tell her.

143
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,810
I'm sorry.

144
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:18,950
I'm really sorry.

145
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,710
How did you know that? Did you see her charts?

146
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:26,290
Dr. In told me to do research on PTSD treatment techniques,

147
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:31,590
so I was looking through patient files and... Oh, I'm so sorry.

148
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:44,560
 I think it would've been better if you were not this great a person.

149
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,850
 Then I could like you a bit more comfortably.

150
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,500
 How nice would it have been if you weren't a doctor?

151
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,960
 Actually, it would've been best if you were unemployed.

152
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,700
What can I help you with?

153
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,910
Why else would a patient's guardian come to meet the doctor?

154
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,060
Please tell me what you came here for.

155
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:21,450
What was it? The methylphenidate? I heard that was a stimulant.

156
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:28,270
My kid... How could you prescribe him a stimulant if you knew he has a minor?

157
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,000
On top of that, without the parents knowing. Are you out of your mind?

158
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,060
Do you want to lose your medical license?

159
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:38,010
I have never prescribed that to him, and Jin Woo's mother knew about this already.

160
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:43,290
I'm not sure why you have this misunderstanding, but I am just a doctor who is helping to treat Jin Woo.

161
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,350
Jin Woo's mom claims that she had no idea.

162
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,750
Well, there must be a reason she can't be honest with you.

163
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,570
- What? 
 - There are records showing what medications have been prescribed to patients,

164
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:57,910
so you can look into that. Well.

165
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:03,960
This hospital was totally shamed all over the media recently.

166
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:09,790
If you don't want to face shame yourself, I suggest you do as I ask.

167
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,100
What exactly are you asking for right now?

168
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:17,800
With the condition that I shut my mouth, I just need one scrip. One.

169
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,780
Think about it carefully.

170
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,930
♪ Talk about the spring ♪

171
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,040
♫ Truthfully, just let it out. ♫

172
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,480
♫ I will tell you certainly ♫

173
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,120
♫ Cherry blossoms-- ♫

174
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:52,240
I came here to see if I could use any of these kids, but there's nothing here.

175
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,770
But still, please give them a chance.

176
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,790
There are some others.

177
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,130
Maybe there's an issue with the instructor...

178
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:02,150
Will it even be worth looking at the others?

179
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:07,370
By the way, how could you pick an instructors like them?

180
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:12,450
One of them has a disease of uncontrollable anger and the other ended their career only having ever been a part of the ensemble.

181
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,850
How could those kids teach anyone anything?

182
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:15,970
Sir.

183
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,360
I think your words are a bit harsh.

184
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,310
Why? Did I say something wrong?

185
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:23,230
- Since when did you cast people on the basis of talent--
- Hey.

186
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:29,160
I'm sorry. There are a lot of kids here who are really talented. Please reconsider.

187
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,330
Ms. Han Woo Joo, are you not showing your temper these days?

188
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:36,220
If it was like before, you would've lost your temper and totally lost it.

189
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,350
Why have you become so calm? That's no fun.

190
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:45,020
I've changed. I'm not like before.

191
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,890
What are you talking about? People don't change easily.

192
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:53,700
That's true, but I'll show you that people can change.

193
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,770
Sir, would you speak with me first?

194
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,730
This way, please.

195
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,670
 Good job.

196
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,800
 You did well.

197
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:46,240
 Don't you think it's more important to understand yourself before you try to figure out what your diagnoses means?

198
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,560
 Can you tell me your story?

199
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,590
 It can be a part of your past, or anything else.

200
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,690
What are you thinking about?

201
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,800
What the heck?

202
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,960
Why are you- How did you know to come here?

203
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,690
I mean, you told me that you were at your academy this morning. Wasn't that a signal for me to come find you?

204
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,280
It wasn't.

205
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,110
- Oh, really? I must've misunderstood. Then I'll be going-
- No!

206
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,360
I really like this kind of misunderstanding.

207
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,480
I thought you wouldn't leave your house for at least a few days.

208
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,700
I was planning on doing that, but I wanted to see you.

209
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:47,130
How do you feel? It's upsetting and difficult, right?

210
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,570
How do you feel?

211
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,450
Me? Suddenly? About what?

212
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:56,560
Have you been sleeping well at night? How do you feel?

213
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:02,740
You seem full of energy, but are you really in a good mood or are you just trying?

214
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,660
I told you I wouldn't be your patient anymore.

215
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:14,130
I even changed my primary doctor to someone else. I wish you wouldn't treat me like a patient.

216
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,190
Do you dislike showing me your weaknesses that much?

217
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,380
Yes. I hate it.

218
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:26,380
Of course I would hate it. Isn't it normal to want to only show your good sides to someone you love?

219
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:37,150
These past couple days, I've been thinking... 
"Why am I the way I am?"

220
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,750
Is it because I was born this way,

221
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:45,220
or because I suffered a shocking incident when I was young?

222
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,310
I wish someone would tell me what kind of kid I was.

223
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,760
I can help you with that.

224
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,110
No.

225
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:58,520
This time, I want to find the answer myself.

226
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,530
How?

227
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,180
First, I'll go to the orphanage I grew up in.

228
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,470
Do you know someone there?

229
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:12,000
The head nun is still there. She'll probably remember me.

230
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,310
Will you be okay? Shall I go with you?

231
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,990
I'll go alone.

232
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,860
This time, I really think I should go alone.

233
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,630
Ms. Woo Joo, you know, right?

234
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,090
That you're not alone.

235
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,050
I know.

236
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,530
Her primary doctor didn't even tell her. Why would you tell that to Woo Joo?

237
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm telling you I had no other choice.

238
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,170
How can someone who's a doctor not distinguish between what you should and shouldn't say?

239
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:45,090
Do you think I stayed quiet this whole time because I'm stupid?

240
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:48,280
It's because there wasn't a reason for me to know.

241
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:53,290
Even if I knew, I'd just hold biases and nothing would improve-

242
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,780
I knew something was off about her.

243
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,880
That's why she was trying so hard to...

244
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,680
Kong Ji you really! Don't tell me what Woo Joo's disease is.

245
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,600
I don't want to hear it.

246
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,690
Am I an idiot? Making the mistake once is enough.

247
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,980
That little...

248
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,310
When is Dr. Noh getting here?

249
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,780
He's on his way right now.

250
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,250
Since when has she been like this?

251
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,580
Five minutes. The hallucinations are severe.

252
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,470
- How many days has it been since she's been readmitted? 
 -  It's been 5 days.

253
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,890
Ms. Kim Young Sun, can you recognize me?

254
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,230
I think it must be delirium tremens.

255
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:45,330
Please place her in an isolated room and monitor her vitals, and give her lorazepam.

256
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,390
Yes, doctor.

257
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,900
We'll move her into an isolated room.

258
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,200
Why won't Dr. Lee even pick up my phone calls?

259
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,350
- Dr. Lee isn't answering any of our phone calls as well. 
 - I see.

260
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:19,380
I'm sure someday, people will recognize what kind of person Dr. Lee is.

261
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,260
Dr. In.

262
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,410
What's going on in the wards?

263
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:38,380
The patient, Kim Young Sun, who was re-admitted five days ago experienced delirium tremens, so I took action.

264
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,750
Doctor. I think it's an injustice for Dr. Lee Si Joon to receive 1 month probation.

265
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:49,000
- So what? 
  - I know that the Vice President doesn't like Dr. Lee.

266
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,620
I feel that the results of the recent hearing were not clean.

267
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,170
So what are you trying to say?

268
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,920
Doctor, why aren't you doing anything?

269
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,020
Shouldn't you be taking all the residents and protesting?

270
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,250
You must harbor some bad feeling toward me.

271
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,840
But I'm going to continue doing nothing. What to do?

272
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,430
I think you're misunderstanding something.

273
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:14,380
If you want to do something for Dr. Lee,  do something within your sphere of influence.

274
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,830
Pay more attention to your patients and give more care to your junior residents.

275
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,660
 After I fought with you, I was really lonely.

276
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,640
 That's why.

277
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:57,450
Where and how badly is she ill?

278
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,410
I hung a sign on the door that I'm closed.

279
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,360
I saw it.

280
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,080
But the lights were on.

281
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,190
I think I came at the right time.

282
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:23,290
Dr. Noh,  you are quite good at timing.

283
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,030
Why? Is something upsetting you?

284
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,840
Rather than upsetting,

285
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,310
it hurts my heart.

286
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:38,070
What should I do for you at a time like this?

287
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:41,090
Since you like classical music, we'll start with some music.

288
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:45,200
Wait. Dr. Noh, one minute.

289
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,590
Just wait one minute. One minute.

290
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,090
It's a cello!

291
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:05,270
I brought it here so I could play something for you eventually.

292
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,750
I think that day is today.

293
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,050
 You've said this before, right?

294
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:07,580
 That your life is divided into before you turned 6 and after you turned 6.

295
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,940
I stepped on it.

296
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,770
Catch it!

297
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,540
Pass it to me! Me!

298
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:41,760
To me! Pass it to me!

299
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,380

300
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:02,030
What brings you here?

301
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:07,760
Hello. I'm someone that used to live here.

302
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,810
My name is Han Woo Joo.

303
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,590
I see.

304
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:18,240
Wait a minute. Who are you?

305
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,760
Oh, my name? Han Woo Joo.

306
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,230
I'm so happy to see you!

307
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,040
Do you know me?

308
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,850
 Han Woo Joo  
 - This was in the possession of Sister Lucia who passed away.

309
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:35,460
I knew that someone named Han Woo Joo stayed at our orphanage,

310
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:41,150
but I kept it all these years because I didn't have a way to deliver this to you.

311
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,310
But what is this?

312
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,230
That... I'm not too sure myself.

313
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,250
She passed away so suddenly.

314
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,580
I haven't heard anything about that.

315
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,660
I do think something is inside.

316
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,200

But... what brings you here so suddenly?

318
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,480
This is the first time you've come back since you left, right?

319
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:09,840
Yes. To be honest, I came to see Sister Lucia.

320
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,740
I didn't know she had passed away.

321
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:19,160
Sister Lucia isn't here, but if you'd like, you can rest here before you leave.

322
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,650
The food at the orphanage is quite tasty.

323
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:24,060
Thank you.

324
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:45,530

325
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,900
