1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,890

2
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,470
What brings you here at this hour?

3
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,770
I have a favor to ask.

4
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,830
Come in and have some tea.

5
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,170
No thanks, I'll only need a minute.

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,010
Woo Joo says she wants to quit theatrical therapy.

7
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,110
She had an issue with one of the patients.

8
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:46,980
I knew she didn't mean it, but I told her to quit. Without hesitation.

9
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,430
- What? 
 - I was actually quite thankful

10
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,640
that she offered first.

11
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,230
You're really the worst.

12
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:02,040
She'll have a hard time. She's a BPD patient who inflicts self harm for attention. 
(BPD = Borderline Personality Disorder.)

13
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,540
She ran in front of my car because she wanted me to look at her,

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,120
just like Jung Se Yeon, who jumped into water in front of me, so that I would never forget her.

15
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,080
They're exactly the same.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,080
I'm so scared... that the same thing will happen again.

17
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,510
The only way someone can get over their fears is by confronting them.

18
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,410
You, as a doctor, should know that better than anyone else.

19
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,460
I don't think I'm ready yet.

20
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,360
Young Won, can you go find Woo Joo?

21
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,870
Don't wait for her to come find you. Go after her first and treat her.

22
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,130
I promised her

23
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,550
that I would never give up.

24
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,060
Please.

25
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,420
I'm going to do it my way, however I want. Is that okay?

26
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,450
Go away.

27
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,000
Anger, go away.

28
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,270
We confirmed there were no instances of violence against the patient by checking the CCTV.

29
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,720
The issue is that, even after the emergency period of three days had expired,

30
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,670
you forcefully admitted the patient without the consent of his guardians.

31
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,650
This breaks a mental health insurance law.

32
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,130
I don't have to explain further for you to understand, right?

33
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,530
I understand. I acknowledge what you've said.

34
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,340
Once we send the results of our investigation to the prosecutor's office, the results will come out soon.

35
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,890
I think they'll likely only penalize you with a fine, given the extenuating circumstances,

36
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,400
but you'll have to be careful from here on out.

37
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,630
If the same issue repeats itself, you'll face more than just a fine.

38
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,540
I understand.

39
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,950
Aren't you curious about who made the report?

40
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,570
People usually always ask about who the informant is.

41
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,740
It must just be someone who doesn't like me.

42
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:58,700
According to the informant, you confessed everything to them personally.

43
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,070
- Me? 
 - Yes.

44
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,200
You should think about it, who you confessed these facts to.

45
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,790
Who could I have confessed everything to?

46
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:51,560
Ru Oh, it's a bit unfamiliar for you being in a new office, right?

47
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,470
Where's the doctor?

48
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,320
Who?

49
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,880
Oh, Dr. Lee Si Joon?

50
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,420
From now on, I am your primary doctor.

51
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,810
Dr. Lee Si Joon told me he explained everything to you.

52
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,290
From now on, you'll be taking a bit more medicine than before,

53
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,510
but you can take all of it, right?

54
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:24,770
Dr. Lee let me know in detail which types of medication you don't react well to,

55
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,750
so don't worry and trust me.

56
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:54,810
Ru Oh, is there someone else in this room other than you and me?

57
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,330
This isn't somewhere people can get in without my permission. The person you're looking at,

58
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,290
how did they get in here?

59
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,550
I didn't call him.

60
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,860
Go. Go!

61
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,070
- Ru Oh. 
 - Go! Go!

62
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,560
- Go! 
 - Ru Oh?

63
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,750
- Go! 
 - Ru Oh!

64
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,740
Go! Go! Go!

65
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,410
Ru Oh! Ru Oh!

66
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,820
- Ru Oh, let's sit down. 
 - Go! Go!

67
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,650
Ru Oh, it's okay.

68
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,910
No, it's okay.

69
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,160
Go! Go!

70
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,420
Ru Oh! Park Ru Oh!

71
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,210
Park Ru Oh!

72
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,170
Ru Oh!

73
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,370
Security, please? It's urgent.

74
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,600
Park Ru Oh!

75
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,560
Dr. Lee!

76
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,860
Dr. Lee! Dr. Lee!

77
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:04,640
Ru Oh... Ru Oh!

78
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:09,100
Ru Oh, Ru Oh. Ru Oh!

79
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:15,300
Are you guys out of your minds? What are you doing to a child?

80
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,120
W-We were just following protocol.

81
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,440
Protocol or whatever, who told you to use these kinds of things whenever you like?

82
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,490
Is this patient holding a weapon? Was he threatening you?

83
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,420
I'm sorry.

84
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,870
Ru Oh!

85
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,670
Hey!

86
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,870
How could he do that to me just after one mistake?

87
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,100
I feel like I've been shot.

88
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,440
Thank you for calling me today.

89
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,760
Cry until you've let it all out.

90
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,720
Why is my life like this?

91
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,400
What's wrong with your life?

92
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,950
I can't get along well with people.

93
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:29,170
If I think that maybe we've gotten close, they all abandon me.

94
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:34,390
They leave me like they're throwing something into a recycling bin.

95
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,130
I really treat them well.

96
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,400
I'm getting more frustrated the more that I think about it. Why is life like this?

97
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,590
You know what frustrates me even more?

98
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:51,440
I don't even dislike Lee Si Joon that much for doing what he did. That aggravates me the most!

99
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,940
Why do you think that is?

100
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,990
Last time...

101
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:03,350
  You're not someone who deserves being cheated on by your boyfriend.

102
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,130
 You're someone who changes the lives of others.

103
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:15,040
When I heard him say those words, I felt alive.

104
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,680
It was like a dying flower

105
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,300
had finally received some sunlight and starting to grow again.

106
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:30,830
Have you ever seen a light shining behind a person?

107
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,590
I saw that behind him that day.

108
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,880
Like he was my savior.

109
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,690
I've always thought of myself as an inconvenience to others.

110
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:51,450
But he told me that I could be someone who helps others.

111
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:56,870
I can be someone who makes others happy.

112
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:07,540
I was so grateful that he helped me realize these things.

113
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,310
I kept being reminded of that day,

114
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:21,560
You must not be able to dislike him because he gave you courage.

115
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,080
I feel horrible.

116
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,120
I can't even curse at him as I please because of that!

117
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,730
Should we try being a bit honest?

118
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,800
What do you want to do?

119
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:50,750
I want to give back to him everything that I've received.

120
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,660
Dr. Lee!

121
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,330
Dr. Lee, Ru Oh has been in an accident.

122
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,840
What kind of accident?

123
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,270
He ran out during his psychological consultation with Dr. In,

124
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:16,720
but the security guards tasered him while chasing him down.

125
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,480
He doesn't have any injuries, but I'm sure he's very shocked.

126
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,930
I think you should go visit him.

127
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,310
- You must be really free. 
 - What?

128
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:32,450
Ru Oh is Dr. In's patient now. Why are you concerning yourself with the patients of another doctor?

129
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:36,500
It's just that... Ru Oh ran out looking for you.

130
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,680
You're a third year attending.

131
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,390
Don't you know where your priorities should be? Just take good care of Kim Young Sun.

132
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:58,160
What? A taser?

133
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,280
That #%@!

134
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,040
@%^&amp;^%$*#!

135
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,830
 (Profanity)

136
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,740
- What's the matter? 
 - Are you going somewhere?

137
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,590
I have a meeting. Do you have something to say to me?

138
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,280
No, I just heard you got hurt.

139
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,730
What do you mean, hurt? I'm fine.

140
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,530
How did something like this happen?

141
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,250
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

142
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,800
Nurse Oh? Has that patient always been this violent?

143
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,850
No. He's suddenly changed recently.

144
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,460
Did something happen?

145
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:00,040
I think we've missed the treatment period.

146
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,600
What does that mean?

147
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,620
I think you should ask Dr. Lee that question directly.

148
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,020
Why Dr. Lee? Was there an issue before?

149
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,480
It's not my place to say.

150
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,030
Sir, we're not here to discuss Dr. Lee right now.

151
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:18,900
Because the security guard used a taser on Ru Oh, we've become a hospital that used violence against a patient.

152
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,800
We need to let the guardians know of the patient's condition as soon as possible.

153
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,720
What for?

154
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,940
Of course, we need to tell them what happened to the patient.

155
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,120
Many people have already seen the guards using the electric taser on the patient.

156
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,810
It will only become a bigger issue later if we try to hide it.

157
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:37,480
Isn't it a given that a security guard would have an electric taser?

158
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,630
The issue is that they used it unnecessarily.

159
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,390
Chief Park, you will report it to the Hospital Director.

160
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,700
Yes, sir.

161
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:57,080
Gosh, if we get sued again or something because of this...

162
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,870
More than that, I think the guardians will try to discharge the patient.

163
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,930
Dr. In, if the guardians want to discharge the patient, let him go immediately.

164
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:15,360
Don't argue with them. I don't even want to hear the 'f' of forcefully admitting the patient.

165
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:24,670
Do you know anything about what Nurse Oh said earlier? What did she mean?

166
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:29,990
I think that's just her way of expressing her dissatisfaction at the work the nurses have to do.

167
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:34,030
No, there's definitely something going on.

168
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:38,240
Can you look into what Nurse Oh meant about missing the treatment period?

169
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,150
She's just overreacting and saying those things.

170
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,240
Should I look into it?

171
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,610
I'll look into it.

172
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:51,480
Why is Lee Si Joon being so quiet? He's not one to stay on the down low.

173
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,900

174
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:46,050
What's going on? Why are you all standing there blankly?

175
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,210
Music. Is there no music?

176
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,610
Um... who are you?

177
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,700
Who

178
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,250
am I?

179
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,520
I think you're in the wrong operating room.

180
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,740
What kind of nonsense are you blabbering? I'm Lee Taek Kyeong.

181
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,690
Scalpel.

182
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:12,230
Where were you? Hurry up and get over here.

183
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,470
Come here. Hey!

184
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,740
Let go! Where are you going?

185
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,380

186
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,030
Hey! Are you crazy?

187
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:26,090
This punk! Let go of me!

188
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,090
Why are you being like this?

189
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,400
Why are you here?

190
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,360
I told you I had a surgery to do at the hospital my son works at!

191
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,230
Out of all hospitals, why does it have to be the hospital your son works at?

192
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,810
What exactly do you want to prove to your son?

193
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,760
This little bastard!

194
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,030
Do you still have something to prove to your son?

195
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,880
What do you know?

196
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,290
I know my son well. I need to show him what's right.

197
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:01,700
He'll come to his senses once he realizes how exceptional I am in the operating room.

198
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,490
A psychiatrist? Aigoo!

199
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,160
Why would you want to wrestle with such weird people?

200
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,270
Do you know why I became a psychiatrist?

201
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,980
It was because I wanted to understand you. You're my father, but I can't understand you!

202
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,330
I wanted to understand you, so I became a psychiatrist.

203
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,830
Lee Si Joon!

204
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,790
Chief Park!

205
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,540
How have you been?

206
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,720
By the way, who is this?

207
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,890
- I have to go into surgery. 
 - He's new around here.

208
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,270
I'll have a word with him.

209
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:40,500
Just wait right here.

210
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,250
I heard about the surgery.

211
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,860
You still shouldn't be acting like this here, to someone who is sick!

212
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:52,500
My dad is not a patient. He's very normal.

213
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:58,230
He's normal enough to report his son to the Human Rights Institution.

214
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,930
What?

215
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,250
Are you saying he filed the report?

216
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,440
Yes. He did it.

217
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,460
How would he have done that?

218
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:19,450
I... told him that I forcefully admitted Ru Oh.

219
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,860
 I wanted to tell this to you.

220
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,090
 Good night.

221
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:42,540
 I wanted to confide in someone about Ru Oh, but it could become a problem.

222
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,980
 I told my father, who wouldn't remember anything anyway.

223
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:57,020
But he was completely normal while he was listening to me that day.

224
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:04,400
He understood everything but pretended not to, then reported me.

225
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,530
Why?

226
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,430
He still can't give it up.

227
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:21,330
He hates that I became a psychiatrist.

228
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:25,130
He wants to step on me at every opportunity he gets.

229
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,930
Hey, speak clearly. Exactly what nonsense are you spouting?

230
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,290
Please just do one thing.

231
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:39,280
Either be a father who is like oil and water to me,

232
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,540
or be a pitiful patient.

233
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:04,610
 Let's go to my room and have some tea.

234
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,430
 Sure.

235
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,640
Here's the person who is sick.

236
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,130
Let's go.

237
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:22,590
What are you doing? Let's go.

238
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,990
Here, let's head that way.

239
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,250
Let go! Aigoo! Aigoo.

240
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:34,700
But Dr. Lee, did you really make the report?

241
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,200
Yes, I did it.

242
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,530
Are you remembering the fact that you made the report?

243
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:44,630
Do you think that I'm a fool? Why would I not know what I've said?

244
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,730
Why... have you aged so much?

245
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,430
Do you know how old I am now?

246
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:59,720
Dye your hair. If someone sees you, they'll think you're some chief in their 50s.

247
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,950
Yes, a dye.

248
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:09,450
Is that funny? You should grow up. You need to find someone, get married, and have kids.

249
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,870
Until when are you going to keep working like this?

250
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,950
Aren't you exhausted? You'll be in trouble at this rate.

251
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:21,370
Speaking of which, I wonder if I'm getting some sort of dementia.

252
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,480
I keep forgetting things.

253
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,430
Don't you frequently get teary-eyed, too?

254
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,430
Dementia frequently comes with depression.

255
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:32,730
What do you mean? Why would I cry? I'm a man.

256
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,270
You should cry sometimes.

257
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,210
If you want to cry, you shouldn't hold it in.

258
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:40,110
Now you can let yourself cry in peace.

259
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:43,080
You've endured a lot of difficult things until now.

260
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,050
Why? Did I offend you?

261
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,550
Are you going to reprimand me now?

262
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,920
Who are you?

263
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,560
Where... where am I?

264
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,230
Why am I here?

265
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:26,410

266
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:34,440
Now, no matter what happens here, nobody will know.

267
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,740
I couldn't sleep at all last night.

268
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,030
Do you know what I looked up all night?

269
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,840
How to turn back time.

270
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:56,200
How great would it be if I could turn back time by just one day?

271
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,590
But there was no such thing like that.

272
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:01,890
What happened yesterday wasn't only your fault.

273
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,840
Don't blame yourself for all of it.

274
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,750
There's more to blame on the doctor who couldn't watch over his patients.

275
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,130
I know that,

276
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:16,080
but I'm the one that got fired. No doctors got fired.

277
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,200
Are you here to complain about that? Because you feel like it's unfair?

278
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:29,610
I'm angry and feel wronged, but for some reason I don't dislike you for it.

279
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:34,500
I need to be angry at you and curse you out, but I can't bring myself to do that.

280
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,290
I wonder why I'm being like this.

281
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,740
Then I realized,

282
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,830
I've received so much from that person.

283
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,720
Before I can repay him for everything, my life won't be right.

284
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,950
I want to repay you for everything I've received.

285
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,670
Is that okay?

286
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:01,670
Do as you like. I don't care whatever it is.

287
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,400
Okay!

288
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,360
Then have a seat over there

289
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,310
and take a listen.

290
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,330
One!

291
00:25:55,830 --> 00:26:00,700
 I want to give back to him everything that I've received.

292
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,940
 What have you received from him?

293
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,010
 Consolation.

294
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,910
By the way,

295
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,140
do you know that?

296
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:31,720
People who can recognize others in pain... are those in more pain.

297
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:37,400
I think the reason you help people who are in pain

298
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,900
is because you're in even more pain.

299
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:53,780
They say that listening to the drums helps you when you're feeling depressed.

300
00:26:53,780 --> 00:27:00,620
Just like how you consoled me, I want to console you.

301
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,950
Instead of how we met,

302
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:09,100
how we part ways is more important.

303
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:14,760

304
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,900
Okay, then.

305
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:28,880
♫  Goodbye, the memories I want to forget  ♫

306
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:36,060
♫   The diary where I wrote down all my sad thoughts   ♫

307
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:42,120
♫   Will I finally   ♫

308
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,570
♫  be able to erase it?  ♫

309
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:49,660
♫  I'm fine   ♫

310
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:53,180
♫  I'm so fine   ♫

311
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,010
♫  Stay by my side   ♫

312
00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:00,080
♫  just like this  ♫

313
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,300

314
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,250
 I keep waiting for him, without even realizing it.

315
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,240
 They are just signs of sexual desire.

316
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,740
 What if it's not just that, but he really likes her?

317
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,680
 Are you familiar with the hidden cam website?

318
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,000
 You're the one taking pictures of me and posting them to the hidden cam website, right?

319
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,560
 Voyeurism? What do you mean?

320
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,560
 Are you saying I'm some sort of pervert?

321
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,370
 You're not the lady I'm used to seeing here.

322
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:23,770
 - Don't you have any pride? 
 - What kind of pride could I have when nothing about me is normal?

323
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:26,470
 Can't you just turn a blind eye and hold on to Woo Joo?

324
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:29,260
 There was something I decided long ago.

325
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,680
 That decision is wavering right now,

326
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,670
 because of Woo Joo.

327
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,400
♫  Lean on me  ♫
