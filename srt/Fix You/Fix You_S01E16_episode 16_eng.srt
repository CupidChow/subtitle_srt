 Episode 16

2
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,250
Hello.

3
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,340
Hello.

4
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,220
- I'm the Vice President of this hospital. 
 - I see.

5
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,610
Are you the actress helping us with theatrical treatment?

6
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,090
How did you know?

7
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,410
I saw you last time, leaving with Dr. Lee Si Joon.

8
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,450
I just wanted to introduce myself to you, since I saw you while I was passing by.

9
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,670
But what are you doing here? Are you waiting for someone?

10
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,280
- I'm waiting for Dr. Lee Si Joon. 
 - Oh...

11
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,390
Have you two known each other for a long time?

12
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,510
I met him because of a patient named Cha Dong Il.

13
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,720
Right, right.

14
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,690
You really suffered because of Cha Dong Il, didn't you?

15
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:35,330
Yes, but I met Dr. Lee Si Joon thanks to that incident.

16
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,300
Is that so?

17
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,000
I heard the operators didn't come today.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,570
Yes. We're working to resolve that issue right now.

19
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,620
What's so difficult about that?

20
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,490
Forget about that. Follow me.

21
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,650
Where are you going?

22
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,590
What? What kind of nonsense is that?

23
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:04,330
That's what I'm saying. It made so little sense to me that I came here.

24
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,920
Is he crazy? Dating a patient?

25
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,010
Vice President, Dr. Lee is not dating Ms. Han Woo Joo.

26
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:13,820
I confirmed it myself! I asked Han Woo Joo directly!

27
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,530
What is it that you really want to say?

28
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,510
What do you mean, what is it? A psychiatrist is dating a patient that he's supposed to be treating.

29
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,220
If rumors start going around, our hospital will be humiliated!

30
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,330
The director is already upset about the incident with Congressman Koh!

31
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,940
It's true that Dr. Lee made a mistake in his treatment of Congressman Koh.

32
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,350
But still. Don't you think this is a bit unfair?

33
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,470
Unfair? What's so unfair about it?

34
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,030
What's unfair about it? Do I seem like I'm just making an issue out of nothing?

35
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,110
Dr. In, tell him! You saw it too!

36
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,280
You saw them linking arms and walking around the hospital!

37
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,090
- Vice President, that... 
 - Did you see it or not?

38
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,770
Did you see it or not?!

39
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,640
Is it real?

40
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,310
Yes.

41
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,280
Good work today.

42
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,140
Woo Jung, go upstairs and check on the wards.

43
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,410
Yes, I'll do that.

44
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,090
You've worked hard today.

45
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,790
Ms. Woo Joo?

46
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,300
When did you get here? I've been watching the door this whole time.

47
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,210
Were you waiting for me?

48
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,910
I couldn't go home.

49
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,780
Why couldn't you go home?

50
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:54,250
My finger... stings and just hurts so much.

51
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,330
What's wrong with your hand?

52
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,060
Earlier, when you passed by me,

53
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,390
your clothing brushed against my finger.

54
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,210
That's just cloth, but it stung and hurt

55
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,000
as if I had been grazed by a knife.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,030
As if I had really been cut by a blade.

57
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,460
After that, my feet wouldn't move.

58
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:26,660
Have you ever experienced something similar before?

59
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,590
When was it?

60
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:37,680
When my adoptive mother dissolved my adoption, she took me back to the orphanage I was from.

61
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:45,500
Then, she turned around after handing me one last $5 bill...

62
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:53,270
A part of her skirt brushed against my finger.

63
00:04:54,470 --> 00:05:00,730
Then, my hand stung and hurt like I had been cut by a knife.

64
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,830
What are you doing?

65
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,050
Touch this, and see if your hands get cut.

66
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:17,660
I mean, I'm just saying it felt like that. I'm not saying I actually cut my hand.

67
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,570
Are you happy now?

68
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:36,390
Feeling like that is because of your painful memories.

69
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:41,740
Dr. Lee. Am I a really sick person?

70
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,490
Tell me honestly.

71
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,980
I heard that Dr. Ji Young Won introduced me to you.

72
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:55,170
Dr. Ji said she just decided to collaborate with you.

73
00:05:55,170 --> 00:06:01,340
Am I someone so broken that doctors need to collaborate to fix me?

74
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,140
Ms. Woo Joo,

75
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,670
I am also sick.

76
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,530
Where?

77
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,780
My mind frequently catches the cold, for no reason.

78
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:20,610
I get treated by the patients that I treat.

79
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,820
While I treat them, I get consoled.

80
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,590
Do you know how much the sounds of those drums you made me listen to last time consoled me?

81
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:34,510
Whenever I feel down, I think of your performance,

82
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,350
then my mood immediately brightens.

83
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,950
Yesterday, I mentioned this in my podcast as well,

84
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,000
but there's nobody who isn't sick.

85
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,030
They just haven't been diagnosed yet.

86
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:56,100
While treating you, I'm also being treated.

87
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,550
Wait a minute.

88
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,870

89
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,840
I just sent you those drumming sounds as a file to you.

90
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,540
Whenever your mind catches a cold, you should listen to it.

91
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:20,410
I read somewhere that this is actually super effective.

92
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:24,200
Oh and, whenever you listen to it, you should imagine my performance too.

93
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,280
I'll tell you more things next time.

94
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,780
Okay.

95
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:33,530
Then... shall we as patients

96
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,690
high-five?

97
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,470
Sure!

98
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,430
What was that?

99
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,400
One more time?

100
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,570
One, two...

101
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,890
I knew you would do that!

102
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,120
- One, two— 
 - Three!

103
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,940
- This is the last time. 
 - One, two, three!

104
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,930
Dr. Lee Si Joon is really incredible.

105
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,220
How could he think of visiting the patient?

106
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,600
Dr. Lee never only meets his patient in his office.

107
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,100
Whether it be at their homes or their workplace, he goes to visit his patients.

108
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,280
I want to be on Dr. Lee's team. Should I ask Dr. In to send me?

109
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,180
Se Chan! If you say that, Dr. In will get pissed!

110
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,480
I've heard that even the patients recently

111
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,140
have been comparing the two doctors.

112
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,320
I got rejected by Si Joon before I could even confess. Before I could even say anything.

113
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,150
Dong Hyuk. I really feel horrible these days.

114
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,540
What's wrong this time?

115
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:40,240
I got rejected by a patient. Han Woo Joo.

116
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,920
She found out that introduced her to Si Joon, and hates me now for abandoning her.

117
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,560
She's a BPD patient. Isn't it a given that she would feel angry about such a thing?

118
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,320
She's totally transferred her emotions to Si Joon right now.

119
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,640
She relies on him a lot.

120
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,900
Is Si Joon aware of this?

121
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,030
Of course he is.

122
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:05,250
I'm sure it's hard for him too. He can't do anything about it.

123
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,750
Then I guess I don't need to worry about anything.

124
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,030
Why? Is something going on?

125
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,410
The Vice President is under the impression that they're dating.

126
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,750
So? Is there an issue?

127
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,390
Did a rumor start?

128
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,940
It's bad if rumors start circulating.

129
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,620
Well, it's fine for now.

130
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,580
If something happens because of that, you should take initiative and dispel the misunderstanding.

131
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,570
Why should I?

132
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:40,940
I'm going to stop standing behind Lee Si Joon.

133
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,660
What does that mean?

134
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,850
I'm going to send a patient to you. She's an attending in our department. She has sociophobia and anxiety.

135
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,650
Don't change the topic. What do you mean by what you just said?

136
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,510
What kind of patient is Ms. Han Woo Joo?

137
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,080
She's a BPD patient.

138
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,410
What?

139
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,430
You asked a BPD patient to take care of theatrical therapy?

140
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,330
I found out after I had asked her to do it.

141
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:26,420
So what if she's a BPD patient? She's doing well with the theatrical treatment.

142
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,600
We can't discriminate against the sick, after proclaiming that sick people should not be discriminated against.

143
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,810
Is Han Joo Woo experiencing transference towards you?

144
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,300
How did you know?

145
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,150
The Vice President said the two of you were dating.

146
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,560
You're not dating her, are you?

147
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,570
Why would you say such a thing?

148
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,610
I'm aware of it.

149
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,630
If you just wait patiently, it goes away on its own.

150
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,620
I'm just waiting for that to happen.

151
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,370
Then why did you link arms with her?

152
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,580
That's because she just suddenly linked her arm with mine,

153
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,400
and if I reject it, she might feel embarrassed.

154
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,970
Then what if... that resurfaces as another wound.

155
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,680
Please be more careful. The Vice President is watching you carefully,

156
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,690
and the Director is sensitive about the issue with Congressman Koh!

157
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,860
If the Director finds this out at a time like this, nothing good will come of it.

158
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,840
I understand.

159
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,210
Draw the line, so there are no more misunderstandings.

160
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:26,070
Under no circumstances should you meet up personally, outside of your office.

161
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,150
Why aren't you answering me?

162
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,220
I thought for a second you were my father with dementia.

163
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,640
Am I being like this for no reason?

164
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,840
If you're going to mention the incident from 8 years ago, don't.

165
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,030
This is different from back then.

166
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,500
A little too much.

167
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,460

168
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,850
How did you think of personally visiting the operators?

169
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:59,400
Vice President, Dr. In is quite clever!

170
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,650
Dr. In is quite eccentric.

171
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:05,190
He went out on a patient visit. It's difficult to see that these days.

172
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,210
You used the emergency telephone to carry out the consultation?

173
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,970
The person who went wasn't me, but Dr. Lee Si Joon.

174
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,120
Dr. In told him to go.

175
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,780
Whoever it may have been, it's more important who came up with the idea.

176
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,290
My reputation had hit rock bottom because of the incident with Congressman Koh,

177
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,160
but thanks you Dr. In, it's been revived.

178
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:31,340
Chief Park! Did you see the news? Dr. In really did something great for our hospital.

179
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,880
Yes, I just saw the news.

180
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,990
Dr. In cleaned up the crap that Dr. Lee Si Joon left.

181
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:44,350
Chief Park, have you confirmed what I asked you about yesterday?

182
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,500
He says it's not true.

183
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,550
What are you talking about?

184
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,370
About that...

185
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:55,740
I think that Dr. Lee Si Joon has personal relations with a patient that he is treating.

186
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,860
I'm telling you it's not true.

187
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,270
The patient is experiencing transference. I confirmed it myself.

188
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:07,900
Transference? Then that's more of a reason not to link arms in the hospital.

189
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,160
Link arms? Inside the hospital?

190
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,220
Please don't misunderstand, Director.

191
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,210
Well, to know if it's a misunderstanding or not, we can just ask directly.

192
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,680
Did you sleep well?

193
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,170
We injected Patient Yang with medication that has high anxiolytic effects late at night to help her sleep.

194
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,380
Since there are variances amongst all patients in their responses to the effectiveness of medication that helps them sleep,

195
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,250
so why don't we use these concurrently with antihistamines?

196
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,190
That sounds good.

197
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,800
Ever since her guardians visited yesterday, she's been sleeping.

198
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,620
I'll call you again once she's awake.

199
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,200
Okay.

200
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,240
Hello?

201
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:20,020
Was the Vice President the one that snitched?

202
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,290
What do I need to explain?

203
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,080
Okay.

204
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,840
Why didn't you just call me?

205
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,950
Can I tell a busy man to come whenever I want him to?

206
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:48,730
I've been hearing about some awkward things. Do you know what I'm talking about?

207
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,970
I wonder... I don't think so.

208
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,790
I heard that you had personal relations with a patient you were treating. Is this true?

209
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,080
You're laughing?

210
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,430
I think you're talking about Ms. Han Woo Joo.

211
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:10,400
She's just a patient. Of course, there's nothing going on between on.

212
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:16,190
I think it's ridiculous that I have to explain myself to you like this.

213
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,280
Are you being like this because of what happened to Congressman Koh?

214
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,060
Dr. Lee! Are you crazy?

215
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,530
Anyone would get pissed if they had to hear about things like this when nothing's going on!

216
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,360
I don't regret my judgement.

217
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,630
It was the best decision I could make as his primary physician.

218
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:36,360
This attitude of yours right now. Are you challenging me?

219
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:42,020
Fine then. Vice President, starting from today, Dr. Lee will get no funding for research.

220
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,410
If he says he'll go to another hospital, then let him go.

221
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,580
I understand.

222
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,700
If rumors like this circulate again, I won't forgive them.

223
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,620
Please tell the patient who is in charge of theatrical therapy to quit.

224
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,610
When did you get here?

225
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,570
Just now.

226
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,370
This is for you.

227
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,520
Thank you.

228
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,720
Then I'll be heading out.

229
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,130
Wait, Ms. Woo Joo.

230
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,770
I'm sorry,

231
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,570
but I don't think I'll be able to consult you today.

232
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:37,700
Something suddenly came up, so I have to cancel all my appointments.

233
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:44,110
That's a relief. I was wondering if I should reschedule my appointment anyway, because the restaurant is really busy today.

234
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,510
Then I'll reschedule your appointment.

235
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,950
Okay.

236
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,020

237
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,860
I thought Lee Si Joon would be different,

238
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,730
but it's not me. He's the same as everyone else.

239
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,320
I...

240
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:16,520
I... was abandoned again.

241
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:24,100
I— I really...

242
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,270
I really bring nothing but misfortune.

243
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:32,620
Even Lee Si Joon experienced misfortune because of me. I feel so bad.

244
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,650
But I really dislike him right now!

245
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,560
Ji Sun, I'm sorry.

246
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,820
I— I really tried not to cry in front of you again.

247
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:49,010
I really didn't want to cry in front of you.

248
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,570
I'm sorry.

249
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,420
The treatment we'll start now will be done using simple objects

250
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,920
to try mimicking the fear you feel

251
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:59,480
at the onset of your panic disorders and getting exposure to that.

252
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,900
First we will start with exposure therapy to nausea and fatigue.

253
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,480
Are you feeling okay?

254
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,490
There is one minute left.

255
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:46,840
Please stop. You can stop now.

256
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,290
Okay take a deep breath.

257
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:56,400
Once a recurrence happens, you'll feel nauseated as you are feeling right now.

258
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,820
However, please remember this one thing.

259
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,500
No matter how nauseated or suffocated you feel, like right now,

260
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,790
you will not die.

261
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:10,330
Please remember this.

262
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:15,650
I've been trying to brush it off using whatever means necessarily.

263
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:23,420
If I can't brush this off, then I will become a slave to that incident forever.

264
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,740
For a while, I prayed every day.

265
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,680
To please make them all experience what I went through.

266
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,180
Did you feel better, once you did that?

267
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:40,040
Not at all. I think I actually felt worse.

268
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,590
What do you feel the more angry and wronged about?

269
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,400
That of course would be that I was secretly filmed.

270
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,220
I think there's something else you feel worse about.

271
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,280
What do you think it is?

272
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,980
I lost my first patient.

273
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,150
I was looking forward to it so much. I feel that's unfair.

274
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,640
- What else? 
 - The economic loss is pretty significant as well.

275
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,040
I have to ride the taxi instead of riding on the subway.

276
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,600
The thing you are the most upset about, beyond all those things you just mentioned,

277
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,300
is the fact that you went from being a successful doctor to being a patient.

278
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,990
Because of those pitiful jerks, you missed your opportunity to treat your very first patient.

279
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:24,820
You even developed sociophobia and are struggling financially.

280
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:29,440
Isn't all of that just so unfair? I'm getting vicarious trauma from just listening to that.

281
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,610

282
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:35,660
That's true.

283
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,610
You had to study so much to meet your first patient.

284
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:43,730
How could it be that a doctor became a patient because of people like those that victimized you?

285
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,960
I can guarantee this.

286
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,730
If you're able to overcome this, when you meet a patient experiencing what you're going through right now,

287
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,910
you'll be the best at treating that patient.

288
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,660
I'll regain my confidence.

289
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,910
I'll help you.

290
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,320
What are you doing?

291
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,410
I heard you're not eating well again these days.

292
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:43,310
I just wanted to stop by. I didn't have anywhere else to go, either.

293
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:46,740
I want to fold an airplane, but it's not going well.

294
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,990
Why do you want to fold an airplane?

295
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:51,510
I have a 6-year old son. He's asking me to fold one for him.

296
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,100
Can you fold one for me?

297
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,190
You have a son?

298
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:09,620
He's so smart.

299
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,060
I think my son will like this!

300
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,460
Do you know how to fold a boat, too?

301
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:55,930
I guess you'll forget whatever I tell you today.

302
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:59,000
How are you so good at folding these?

303
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,830
I learned it from my father.

304
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,130
Is that so?

305
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:12,350
I'll fold you a boat, a turtle, and a rabbit. All of it.

306
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:15,280
But in return, can you listen to what I have to say?

307
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,050
Sure.

308
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:25,020
I... think I'm experiencing transference.

309
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,100
Towards a patient that I'm treating.

310
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,310
Oh, gosh!

311
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,650
Do you even understand what I'm saying?

312
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,720
You said you turned into a fish.

313
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,290
He says he's a fish!

314
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,570
So what happened?

315
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:55,930
To be honest, I've known for a while but I kept denying it.

316
00:25:55,930 --> 00:26:02,570
I didn't want the same thing to happen again. I even tried not meeting her again.

317
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:09,450
I tried to avoid her, but ultimately...

318
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:14,820
I've come all the way here, like some sort of fate.

319
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,520
Wow, you're so good at folding those.

320
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,500
What should I do?

321
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:28,620
Should I... keep running like this?

322
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,070
Or should I choose a different path?

323
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,760
Life is short.

324
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:39,530
Just go. Don't go back. Life is straight forward.

325
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,260
Exactly.

326
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:46,350
My son will probably grow up in no time. Straight up.

327
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,730
Of course.

328
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,090
Once your son gets older,

329
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,750
he'll...

330
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:07,010
there will come a day when he folds papers for his father like this.

331
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:18,670
What's that one?

332
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:29,630
This is delicious!

333
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,110
It's good.

334
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,850
You should have some too.

335
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:36,660
It's so good!

336
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,710
Come on, eat some.

337
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,060
What's this?

338
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,830
Why is nobody here? They told me to come.

339
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,290
Kang Noo Ri!

340
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:18,670
We love you, Kang Noo Ri!

341
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,740
Sunbae,

342
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:30,180
you said your favorite food is home-cooked food, so we prepared it for you.

343
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,170
Ta-da! Yay!

344
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:37,480
Sunbae.

345
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,230
Sunbae, you've been through a lot.

346
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,660
Oh no! Don't cry.

347
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,060
Why are you crying?

348
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,580
Eat up!

349
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,630
This looks so good.

350
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:52,000
Eat lots!

351
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,110
It's good!

352
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:02,110
Would you like to try some of this?

353
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,720
Thanks.

354
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,900
Thank you! This is so good!

355
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,870
It's totally delicious!

356
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,650
Be quiet. Let me eat.

357
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:15,070
Please.

358
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,030
I'm sorry.

359
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,040
It's really good.

360
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:47,860

361
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:55,490
♫  The endlessly dark evening road is narrow and far.  ♫

362
00:29:55,490 --> 00:30:02,170
♫   When you don't know where to go,  ♫

363
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:09,670
♫  I'll be there for you, on the corner of the road.  ♫

364
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:16,420
♫  It'll all be okay, so don't worry.  ♫

365
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:21,580
♫  I love you.  ♫

366
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,160
♫  I always have.  ♫

367
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,380
 Fix You

368
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:30,360
 Why were you good to me then? Why did you confuse me?

369
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,250
 My brother has been diagnosed with PTSD.

370
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:36,120
 PTSD is quite bad for Lee Si Joon as well.

371
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,620
 There's a fire! A fire!

372
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,560
 Why do you keep laughing?

373
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,000
 You shouldn't use that friendly face of yours to scam people!

374
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,870
 S-Scam?

375
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:47,160
 You can't just cast someone away like this.

376
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,710
 Do you think of Ms. Woo Joo as special?

377
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:54,080
 Ms. Woo Joo, you've always been different from other patients.

378
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,710
 Why are you leading such a difficult life?

379
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:00,100
♫   When I think of you, it gets better.   ♫
