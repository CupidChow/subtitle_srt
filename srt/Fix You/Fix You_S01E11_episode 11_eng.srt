1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,540

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,940
 When you fall ill because of a wound in your mind,

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,180
 they describe this as 'psychogenic'.

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:22,630

5
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,290
 A psychogenic illness is a phenomenon

6
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,170
 caused by mental or other psychological factors.

7
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:53,200
 When a similar situation repeats itself, it makes you want to avoid it or hesitate.

8
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:03,120
 Just like how depression can fade when you run because adrenaline is secreted through your body,

9
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,720
 some scientists claim that psychogenic illnesses can be fixed

10
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,540
 with neurological or chemical solutions.

11
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:21,550
 However, even if all the chemical substances in our body are functioning properly,

12
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,760
 our minds are not like a computer.

13
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,000
 Our mind is a collection of all our life's experiences.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,350
 It consists of love, pain,

15
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,390
 loss, anger, violence, peace,

16
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,040
 and happiness.

17
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,210
♫  Through the deep and small mountain valley,  ♫

18
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:55,100
♫  To the stream where clear water flows.   ♫

19
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:01,230
♫  Slightly hidden amongst the pretty flowers  ♫

20
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:06,140
Why are you sitting there and singing to the ground?

21
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,000
- Come here.
- Why?

22
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,080
Isn't it cool?

23
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,320
Wow. How could a flower bloom somewhere like this?

24
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,740
I'm singing for it so it'll grow well.

25
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,850
Goodness, stop messing around and stand up.

26
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,620
- You have to come out early tomorrow. 
 - Me? Why?

27
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,390
- You got fired from the hospital. Work part-time at my restaurant. 
 - Just like that?

28
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,520
You got fired from your part-time gig at the hospital.

29
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,500
If a person suddenly has no work, they'll get a disease.

30
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:41,360
 There is only one way to cure a psychogenic illness.

31
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,420
 It's to confront your fears.

32
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:58,050
 In order to free yourself of the darkness, you need to walk into it.

33
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:06,180
 To begin this process, you must let go of the memories from when you were hurt.

34
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,020
 I keep waiting for him, without even realizing it.

35
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,990
"Will he not come to eat lunch?"

36
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,510
"Will he stop by on his way home to have a drink?"

37
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,840
If you're so curious, you could call him.

38
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,910
It's not like you guys are enemies now.

39
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,580
I'm afraid I'll get found out.

40
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,730
What will?

41
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,060
My feelings.

42
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,220
I think... I like him.

43
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,270
But I don't actually like him.

44
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,970
I've never been great at controlling my emotions. That's probably why I feel this way.

45
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,880
Why do you think that?

46
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,170
How should I put it?

47
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:23,680
I've never been in love before, but maybe it's a feeling like I've lost him?

48
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:28,560
It's only been a few days, but I miss him so much.

49
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,160
I think of him all day.

50
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:36,620
I thought my temper was the only thing I couldn't control, but I guess these feelings can't be controlled either.

51
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,690
Doctor, why am I like this?

52
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:46,430
Liking someone doesn't become an issue.

53
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:51,180
Don't try to deny it. Try to look into it as if you're looking into a mirror.

54
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,330
See if you really like him,

55
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,720
or if this is coming from feelings of abandonment

56
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,270
since you've become dependent and used to him.

57
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,340
Feelings of abandonment?

58
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:07,920
When you feel that you've suddenly been abandoned, it's natural to look for people to lean and depend on.

59
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,230
Maybe that's it.

60
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:19,030
But what if this is real?

61
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,840
Then, is it okay for me to like him?

62
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:27,940
Does someone like me have the right to like others?

63
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,690
What sort of rights do you need to like someone?

64
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,710
Dr. Lee!

65
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,780
Dr. Lee, I'm getting discharged!

66
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,050
Are you happy you're going home?

67
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,040
Where's your mother?

68
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,600
She went to fill out the discharge forms. She said she'll be back soon.

69
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:13,270
Really? Then should we take a walk before your mom gets back?

70
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,380
Where are you taking Ru Oh? His guardian will be here soon.

71
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,450
I know. Since she'll be here soon, I'll come back quickly.

72
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:31,070
Dr. Lee, do you know that everything that happens in this ward is my responsibility?

73
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:36,340
I want to take a walk with Ru Oh and say my farewells.

74
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,800
Do it here.

75
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,000
I gave him permission.

76
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,730
Dr. Lee got permission from me, Ru Oh's primary physician, to take him out.

77
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,840
Why are you being like this as well?

78
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,600
See you soon.

79
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,630
Thanks.

80
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,340
You never gave him permission.

81
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,350
Do you think I wouldn't even pick up on that much?

82
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,800
You know that his guardian is already upset about the incident with the taser.

83
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,990
I'll put in a good word with the guardian, Nurse Oh.

84
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:18,890
My mother, who passed away, was also very dedicated to raising her children well.

85
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:23,740
She wanted to send me to Daechi-dong Hakwon to study. 
 (T/N: Daechi-dong is a neighborhood in a rich Gangnam area of Seoul.)

86
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:30,180
She said if I did that, I could make rich friends and get into a good university.

87
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:39,070
But as a native of Byeon-dong, it was something we couldn't even dream of doing.

88
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:46,070
So my mother came up with a new idea: insurance.

89
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:53,310
My grandmother had a front lawn at her house in Gimpo.

90
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:58,630
One afternoon, my mother was mowing the lawn

91
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,280
and she cut her own toes.

92
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:10,010
She went into surgery right away, but we couldn't find one of her toes.

93
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,530
As I spent the whole night looking for her toe.

94
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:17,830
I cried so much.

95
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:24,890
I didn't know grass could be so sharp until that day.

96
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,970
With the money we got from the insurance, we moved to Daechi.

97
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:34,150
Why are you telling me this?

98
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:43,640
Sometimes, I still have nightmares of looking for my mother's toe.

99
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:50,250
My mother passed away, but the nightmare won't go away.

100
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:57,400
I thought Ru Oh could be chased by nightmares for his whole life, like I am.

101
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,640
That's why I'm telling you.

102
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:25,950
Ru Oh, do you hear the wind?

103
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,180
Yes, I hear it.

104
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,290
How does it sound?

105
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,040
It's warm.

106
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,840
That's right. It's warm.

107
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,820
It's comforting.

108
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,690
Do you feel it wrapping around you?

109
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,630
Yes, I feel it.

110
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:54,580
Do you hear it rustling the leaves?

111
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,650
I hear it.

112
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,200
What about it weaving through the grass?

113
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,010
I hear that, too.

114
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,840
Ru Oh.

115
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,460
In the world, there are both good sounds and bad sounds.

116
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,830
There are real and fake things. Remember that.

117
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:22,400
The sounds you hear right now are good sounds, and they're real.

118
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,410
They make you feel warm and comforted.

119
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:34,210
The sounds that bother you and make things difficult for you are bad sounds, and they're not real.

120
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,130
You mean like the voices in my head?

121
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:42,940
You know they're not real, right?

122
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:50,300
From now on, just listen to the real sounds. Forget the fake ones.

123
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,870
You'll remember this, right?

124
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,930
I promise.

125
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,670
 A single sound changed a life.

126
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:10,310
 Go home, returnee! Go home, returnee! Go home, returnee!

127
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:14,010
 With that one phrase, a mind was broken.

128
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:18,710
 The winds healed the broken mind,

129
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,950
 and the sounds gave life to a  depressed soul.

130
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,110
Ru Oh,

131
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,850
this is a secret of mine.

132
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:59,460
To be honest, there's a sound that keeps

133
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:03,640
beating in my ears as well.

134
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:08,580
Is it comforting? Is it warm?

135
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,820
Very!

136
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,670
Come on!

137
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,490
- Boss. 
 - Yes?

138
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,270
Can you buy me beer?

139
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,810
Please! Please!

140
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,860
 How much are you going to drink?

141
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,500
I wonder how Si Joon feels right now.

142
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,140
I'm sure his mind is all jumbled up right now.

143
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,260
He gave up on his patient.

144
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:05,520
Woo Joo says she likes Si Joon.

145
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,180
- Is it transference? 
 - I think so.

146
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:13,270
This is why Lee Si Joon didn't want to take care of a BPD patient.

147
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,000
What if it's not transference, but real feelings?

148
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,500
Do you think something will happen between Si Joon and Woo Joo?

149
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,890
Getting too involved with one patient was enough. Lee Si Joon isn't one to make the same mistake twice.

150
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:35,620
Do you know what I've been worrying about ever since I heard Ms. Woo Joo's confession?

151
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,070
What if something like that happens again?

152
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,220
I knew it from the start.

153
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,430
That 8 years ago, Jung Se Yeon was in a critical state.

154
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:55,030
But I didn't tell Si Joon because I was jealous.

155
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:59,050
Se Yeon depended on me so much.

156
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,790
I don't think anything could be more pathetic than this.

157
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:14,380
I knew that you knew the truth but kept it from Si Joon.

158
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,470
Doesn't that make me more pathetic?

159
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:28,490
These days, I've started wanting to confess to Si Joon.

160
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:33,210
If I do that, then maybe I could earn his feelings as well.

161
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,550
 The inner circle train for

162
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:03,720
 Seoul National University is approaching.

163
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,180
What are you doing?

164
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:16,390
You were just secretly filming this woman, weren't you?

165
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,140
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes?

166
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,550
This man just took inappropriately foot—

167
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,750
He was secretly filming you!

168
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,530
Move!

169
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:33,750
Stop him! Stop him!

170
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,340
Please stop him!

171
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,320
Let go! What are you doing?

172
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,040
This thief!

173
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,450
I'm not a thief! I'm not!

174
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,560
He's not a thief, but a voyeur.

175
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,690
- What? Give me your phone! 
 - Check his phone!

176
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,530
Take it out!

177
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,420
I'm so shocked.

178
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:04,940
How could the best cardiac surgeon in our country be a voyeur? Does that make any sense?

179
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,100
How do you think I felt? I witnessed it myself.

180
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,630
I thought I was going to pass out.

181
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,630
I've taken a class from that doctor before.

182
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,670
He really isn't someone that would do that.

183
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,430
Do you think there's been a mistake?

184
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:22,040
There were tons of pictures found on his phone,

185
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,040
and he posted them onto adult sites.

186
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,520
The cardiothoracic surgery department at that hospital is in a total frenzy.

187
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,390
His entire life's been ruined.

188
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,490
He probably can't be a doctor now, right?

189
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:38,080
There are over 1000 doctors who have accounts on a website called 'Voy-tor".

190
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,310
They took 'voy' from voyeur,

191
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:44,230
and put it together with the 'tor' from doctor.

192
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,860
Wow, how could you use your brains for something like this?

193
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,670
But that "Voytor" site seemed quite well known amongst our peers.

194
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,720
What?

195
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:58,920
Wow, these worthless bastards! Really!

196
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,770
 All hospitals are in a state of emergency right now.

197
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:05,420
Aren't you close to Dr. Park from the hospital's cardiothoracic department?

198
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:09,960
You used to brag about him all the time.

199
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,440
No, not at all! What do you mean, close?

200
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,360
I just knew of him.

201
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,050
I heard the site had over 1000 members, so I looked into it just in case.

202
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,470
I was flabbergasted to find doctors from our hospital were members as well.

203
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,690
How many were there?

204
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:31,580
So far, 22 of them have been found out. What should we do about them?

205
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:37,210
I think it would be best for the patients as well if we took care of things before a police investigation begins.

206
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:40,320
Since we need to have good reasons to fire them,

207
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,250
shouldn't we do that after the police investigation?

208
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,730
Regardless of what their penalties are by law,

209
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:50,240
I don't want to have those types of doctors treating patients. Let's just deal with it now.

210
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,060
Hospital Director, paraphilia is a serious mental disorder.

211
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,580
I don't think that our hospital, which has a mental health center in progress,

212
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:01,480
should deal with this issue by simply firing those doctors.

213
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,660
What are you suggesting?

214
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:09,770
I'm saying... even if we end up firing them, shouldn't we treat them first?

215
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,470
That will help prevent even greater crimes in the future.

216
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:18,030
It is true that paraphilia is a serious condition that could have large societal impact.

217
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:27,300
We will be starting group psychological consultations with paraphilia patients.

218
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,500
Of the doctors who had memberships on the illegal website, 22 were from our hospital.

219
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,940
Of these 22, we will be treating the 8 patients that seem to have a voyeuristic disorder.

220
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,420
Chief, have those doctors agreed to treatment?

221
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:42,630
No. They don't know about anything yet. We need to go find them and convince them.

222
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,290
I think they'll reject treatment since it's such a sensitive issue.

223
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,640
Who would want to admit they're a voyeur?

224
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,220
We have to convince them somehow, whether by threat or by sweet words.

225
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,940
That's your specialty.

226
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,920
What? It's not like I'm some sort of gangster.

227
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:03,350
I have a lot of patients to tend to, since all my appointments were pushed back while I was on probation.

228
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:09,740
With this case, you all need to be especially careful about handling patient information.

229
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,440
- Do you understand? 
 - Yes, sir.

230
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,550
- Dr. Kang. 
 - Yes?

231
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,130
This time,

232
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,440
you'll be getting your first patient.

233
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,520
Really?

234
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,340
Now you're really a doctor.

235
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,660
Congratulations. Good luck.

236
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:36,000
Wow, Nu Ri. You caught a voyeur in the subway station and now you're treating patients. This must be fate!

237
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,640
I'll take it as a sign from the heavens to really try my best.

238
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,300
Okay!

239
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,850
We are psychiatrists. The names I now reveal

240
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:56,390
are not to be seen as fellow doctors who are on inappropriate sites,

241
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,850
but as paraphilia patients.

242
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:02,440
You must not forget this fact.

243
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,750
Okay. The first patient is...

244
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:11,480
They said the patient was conscious enough to write when they arrived at the hospital.

245
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,400
Exactly

246
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,650
how did his heart stop in just one hour?

247
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:19,940
That means you didn't respond appropriately to the emergency.

248
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:25,080
He told us that he had difficulty breathing, so we assisted him with a mechanical ventilator without any issues.

249
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,780
His vital signs were good,

250
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:31,460
and he was able to communicate with us until you arrived.

251
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:36,990
We called you multiple times to tell you that the patient needed to get surgery immediately because his chest injury was severe.

252
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:41,760
But it took you one hour to get here, so...

253
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,500
So you're saying this is all my fault?

254
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,080
Answer me.

255
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,660
Is it my fault?

256
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,820
Not at all.

257
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,740
The patient is brain dead right now.

258
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,360
What are you guys going to do?

259
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,320
I'm sorry.

260
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,130
- I'm okay. 
 - You just look really tired.

261
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,020
Here, take it.

262
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,040
Thank you.

263
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,520
I'm a psychiatrist, Dr. Lee Si Joon.

264
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,880
Do you have something to say to me?

265
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,100
You know of 'Voy-tor', right?

266
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,200
You're a member on that site, right?

267
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:56,100
- How did you know? 
 - That's not what's important.

268
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,240
I'll get straight to the point.

269
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,500
People let down their guards because they don't know much about it,

270
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,910
but voyeurism is actually a more serious mental health issue than you may think.

271
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:09,630
That's why I want to help you.

272
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,840
What are you trying to do here?

273
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:19,810
I don't know how you found out, but don't mistake me as some kind of pervert just because I watched that for fun a few times.

274
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:22,730
I went to the police station early this morning and got investigated.

275
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:27,450
I was just— I watched it a few times out of curiosity.

276
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:31,570
Your membership status... was gold.

277
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:41,680
That's probably because I told my colleagues my password and it increased views from my account.

278
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,500
Do I need to make excuses for all these things?

279
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,550
There's no need for excuses. You'll be punished by law anyway.

280
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,920
What did you say?

281
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,490
I'm saying I'll help treat you, no matter your excuses.

282
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:56,180
Everything you say will be confidential, so there's no need to worry.

283
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:51,840
What are you doing?

284
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,090
Oh no, looks like I accidentally got your face?

285
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:58,030
I told you earlier that voyeurism is an illness.

286
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:02,430
No matter how hard you try not to watch it, a strong resolve isn't enough because it's addicting.

287
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:06,390
I'll keep everything confidential, and treat you.

288
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:09,800
Then, when shall we start?

289
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,250
Voyeurism is a serious mental health issue,

290
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,890
so you should get treatment before something worse happens.

291
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:20,480
I'm telling you I'm not a voyeur. What do you take me as?

292
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,020
Didn't you understand what I said? Do you want to end it all here?

293
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,620
I'm telling you, I'm not!

294
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:33,710
Hey, you pathetic punk. Did you have nothing better to do?

295
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,380
What the hell is 'Voy-tor', huh?

296
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:40,310
Be grateful that the hospital is offering to treat you, and get the treatment.

297
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,080
I really don't know why I did that.

298
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,090
Woo Jung, what should I do now?

299
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:47,540
Can you make me human?

300
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,740
Please?

301
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,350
This is something treatable,

302
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:55,780
Seung Joon. Trust us and get treated.

303
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,450
It's just a psychological illness.

304
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:03,080
I'm telling you not to interfere. Forget it! It's my life.

305
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,590
Take a seat. Sit down.

306
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:10,960
I don't think you're grasping the situation. Do you think you're a doctor now that you have the coat on? You're not.

307
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,440
Get treatment while we say we'll treat you. Okay?

308
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:40,610
You must have something upsetting you, coming to the chapel at this time of day.

309
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:46,520
 Where have I seen her? She looks familiar.

310
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,880
I'm Kang Nu Ri, an attending psychiatrist.

311
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,700
Do you have something to tell me?

312
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:56,510
You know of 'Voy-tor', right?

313
00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:00,570
Because of that, every hospital has been turned upside down recently.

314
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:05,450
They're making a fuss about tracking down all the doctors with memberships and firing them.

315
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:11,920
But at our hospital, we've decided to treat those patients with voyeurism.

316
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:19,630
To put it simply, you're my patient from now on.

317
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,710
 I remembered. It's her.

318
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:25,970
Of course, your confidentiality will be kept.

319
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:29,730
You must be shocked.

320
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:35,160
Don't worry, from now on you have an attending doctor.

321
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:39,320
We've completed all the individual consultations. So far, 5 patients have agreed to treatment.

322
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:44,490
Take some more initiative in this incident. It's a great opportunity to get some brownie points from the Hospital Director.

323
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:47,590
What's happened to that doctor, your friend?

324
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,590
His life's basically over.

325
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:53,390
He used to talk about how stressed he was at every opportunity he got.

326
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:57,750
He was cursed at a lot for having done cardiothoracic operation on the former president.

327
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,060
What a waste of talent.

328
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:05,390
It'll be hard for him to operate again. Voyeurism? What the hell.

329
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:08,520
- Take care. 
 - Bye.

330
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:12,910
I'm in such a good mood, I can't just leave.

331
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,730
Here, a tip for you.

332
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,630
- Take it. Take it. 
 - Thank you.

333
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:20,040
- I'll see you again, miss. 
 - Please come again!

334
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,910
See you!

335
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,590
Ji Sun!

336
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,820
I got a tip.

337
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,680
I'll give it to you.

338
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:45,410
Why are you being like this? What's the problem?

339
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:49,970
Is this a pub? Why are you sitting with the customers and pouring their alcohol?

340
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,360
This is a restaurant.

341
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,810
It's a restaurant that I opened because I wanted to serve warm, homemade food for people who couldn't eat proper meals.

342
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:59,880
What should I have done, then? They asked me to do it.

343
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,810
He asked me to pour their drinks.

344
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:04,730
You're not that kind of person. Act normal.

345
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,390
You mean... I should yell and flip tables over, like normal?

346
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,360
Yeah, that'd actually be better than this.

347
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,700
Do you think I wanted to pour their drinks?

348
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,190
I held it in, for you.

349
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:24,390
For me? How is that for me?

350
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:28,950
Did I ever ask you to meet all customers at eye level? Don't you have any pride?

351
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:32,150
If you're going to act like this, I'd prefer you yell and have a hot temper like you used to.

352
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,160
I can't stand watching you act like this.

353
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:44,120
I have no pride. What kind of pride could I have after getting fired from my part-time job at the hospital?

354
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:48,750
There's nothing normal about me! What kind of pride can I uphold?

355
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,290
The customer's eye level? So what if I match it?

356
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,100
I just need to make good sales.

357
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,020
You're such an idiot.

358
00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:00,410
I am an idiot. I only have you left now. What couldn't I do for you?

359
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,900
Han Woo Joo.

360
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:21,500
I won!

361
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,110
Doctor!

362
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,540
Hello?
