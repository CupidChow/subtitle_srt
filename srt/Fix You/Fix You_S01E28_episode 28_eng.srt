1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,730

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:13,560

3
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,470
 Have you had lunch?

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,910
 Dr. Lee, I love you!

5
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,180
Why would you love me? That's gross.

6
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,750
 Dr. Lee, don't worry about the hospital. I'll be taking good care of everything.

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,970
 Dr. Lee! I already miss you.

8
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,660
 Dr. Lee, I really miss you. Please come back soon.

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,680
What the heck? Did they plan this?

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,060
Why are they being like this all at once?

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,700
Oh, he read it!

12
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,010
Me too!

13
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,880
Same!

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,580
He must have started being more active.

15
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:15,740
I'm going to get indigestion. You said you had something to say to me, but all you're doing is eating.

16
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,560
If you have something to say, say it. I'm busy.

17
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,390
You were placed on probation from work. Why would you be busy?

18
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,270
Did you come here to spy on me?

19
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,800
Did you think I would be curled up on my couch sleeping all day?

20
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,980
To be honest, that's what I thought you'd be doing, but seeing as you're working out, you seem to be doing ok.

21
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,950
Are you that worried about me?

22
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:47,930
You don't know that Dr. Lee Taek Kyeong asked me to look after you, do you?

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,560
- When? 
 - When you first said you were coming to the psychiatry department.

24
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,020
Why did he hit me then...

25
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,240
That's what a father is.

26
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:09,780
Lee Si Joon. This is my first time saying something like this to you,

27
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,830
but to be honest, I'm cheering you on.

28
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,160
Though you did face a disciplinary hearing,

29
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,330
that doesn't mean that your sincerity faced disciplinary action, too.

30
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,390
Well, the worldly snobs and others will probably never know, but

31
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,920
the heavens and earth know.

32
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,700
Above all, your patients know better than anyone else.

33
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,390
As expected! Someone like you needs to become the director of the new Mental Health Clinic.

34
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,190
Oh goodness. I'm already done for.

35
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,760
Don't give up. If you do, then the Vice President will become director.

36
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,840
The Vice President?

37
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,310
That can't happen. There's something I have in mind, though I'm not sure it'll go as planned.

38
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,150
What is that?

39
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,400
Just eat your food.

40
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,810
How are you feeling?

41
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,490
I'm sure I shocked you too much last time.

42
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,860
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,370
Do you feel like a hot fire is living in your stomach today, too?

44
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,820
Right here. It's all the way up here.

45
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,840
Why did it rise so much again?

46
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,130
Did something happen?

47
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,170
Yesterday, my daughter suddenly asked for a vegetable pancake.

48
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,550
Dae Woong's favorite food was vegetable pancake.

49
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,170
I got mad at my daughter before I could even realize what I was doing.

50
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,400
Asking her why she was asking for vegetable pancake.

51
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,910
Your daughter must not have known why her mom was suddenly so angry at her.

52
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:46,300
I thought that crying was my right.

53
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,130
Since I'm a mom.

54
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,110
But my daughter told me

55
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:54,920
that she's so sick of me crying, that she's come to dislike her brother.

56
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:00,490
The second I heard that, I got so angry, I yelled at my daughter to leave the house immediately.

57
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:05,900
Your daughter must have been upset at how difficult things have been for you.

58
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,860
Our entire family is falling apart.

59
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,560
You and your daughter... your entire family must be suffering.

60
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,650
My son died because I have no money

61
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,130
and no connections.

62
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:31,660
If I had money and connections, I wouldn't have sent him to the military.

63
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,950
Dae Woong's mother!

64
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:55,040
Excuse me! Can you please listen to my story for just a moment?

65
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,270
- I have a son. 
 - I'm sorry, I'm a bit busy right now.

66
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,040
Excuse me!

67
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,070
You have me. Please tell me.

68
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,870
Did you feel stuffy inside the consultation room? Is that why?

69
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,340
I want the whole world to know about my son.

70
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:17,760
I want to tell everyone how kind my son was.

71
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,740
I think she finds it so unjust that her son

72
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,350
will just be forgotten by the world in this way.

73
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,360
I'm sure she's full of grief and resentment about it.

74
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,770
How difficult must it be for everyone, that they had to make her son's name unspeakable in their family?

75
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,430
Young Won, that patient must have been difficult for you, too.

76
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,670
Oddly enough, when I listen to that patient, I have difficulty staying objective.

77
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,590
When I'm listening to her, my heart hurts so much.

78
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,620
Are you laughing at me right now?

79
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,210
No, why would I do that?

80
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,800
I can just imagine you.

81
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,420
I can imagine you during your consultation, and even following the patient out the door.

82
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,850
Young Won,

83
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,410
should I transfer to your hospital?

84
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,470
What are you talking about?

85
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,630
If I go there, will you take me in?

86
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:24,350
You like to do research and teach students, outside of just doing consultations.

87
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,960
Am I really like that?

88
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,020
I keep getting told I have no qualifications.

89
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,950
Why are you saying that? Did something happen at your hospital?

90
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:38,860
It's nothing. I'm just a bit... exhausted.

91
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:44,430
Dong Hyuk, even if the entire world goes crazy, please stay as you are.

92
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,210
- Why? 
 - You're that kind of person to me.

93
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:55,080
Ji Young Won, I'm not that normal either.

94
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,140
I'm just acting like I'm normal.

95
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:13,460
 Doctor... Don't take my words lightly. Do you think I'm acting this way without any evidence?

96
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,890
 You have four days.

97
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,400
This is so ridiculous...

98
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,300
What text is it?

99
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,680
A ridiculous text.

100
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,950
 Do you think I'm acting this way without any evidence?

101
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:23,830
This time, a large dog tried to use its red tongue to lick Neilsen.

102
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,910
"I did wrong! Please forgive me! Please leave me alone."

103
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,810
Neilsen ran away from the dog all over the entire yard.

104
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,260
He got so desperate that he hung on to the giant.

105
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,470
"Oh no! Save me!"

106
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:42,720
Neilsen ran away into the barn.

107
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,060
The cows saw Neilsen and laughed as if they found the situation ridiculous.

108
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:54,110
Neilsen grew into a very kind and friendly child.

109
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,000
The end.

110
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,620
 Han Woo Joo

111
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:54,000
 To my daughter, Han Woo Joo.

112
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,830
- Hello? 
 - What were you doing?

113
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:14,030
I was reading to the kids and put them to sleep.

114
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,390
Did you meet the head nun?

115
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,660
I found out she passed away three years ago.

116
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,520
Oh no...

117
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,240
But... out of her belongings,

118
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,840
there's a letter that my birth mom wrote for me.

119
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,520
What are you talking about?

120
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,660
Basically, the head nun has been keeping for all these years

121
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,070
a letter my mom wrote to me

122
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,170
when I was eight years old.

123
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,230
Did you read it?

124
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,020
No.

125
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,090
I haven't been able to.

126
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,870
I'm so scared.

127
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:56,220
 I'm so scared it'll say something bad.

128
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,750
Judging from how she didn't give this to me even as I left,

129
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,520
it must mean something really horrible is written on it, right?

130
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,720
 But I should still read it, right?

131
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,530
Ms. Woo Joo, I'll go there.

132
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,070
 I really wasn't going to ask you to,

133
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,800
but please come.

134
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,780
I'm...

135
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,010
so scared and afraid right now.

136
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:50,080
- You're here? 
 - You came alone?

137
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,000
Early in the morning.

138
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,750
You slept in here?

139
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,550
Oh goodness, my back.

140
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,320
I mean... I thought you would come in the morning.

141
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,750
I couldn't sleep.

142
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,010
Wow, the weather sure is nice.

143
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,200
Why are you hitting me! Let go!

144
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:26,860
♫  The endlessly dark evening road is narrow and far.  ♫

145
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,730
♫   When you don't   ♫

146
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:33,600
♫  know where to go,  ♫

147
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,590
♫  I'll be there for you,  ♫

148
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,960
♫   on the corner of the road.   ♫

149
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,420
- Should we do a group hug?
- Yes!

150
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,730
Don't cry. 
♫  So don't worry.  ♫

151
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,550
Okay!

152
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:53,190
We'll miss you! 
 ♫  I love you.  ♫

153
00:12:54,260 --> 00:13:00,680
♫  I always have.  ♫

154
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:08,120
♫  Waiting for you and looking at you, like this.  ♫

155
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:14,860
♫   Brings me more happiness than anything else.  ♫

156
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
This is perfect.

157
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:30,630
♫   When I think of you, it gets better.   ♫

158
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:37,990
♫  In the unknown days and nights that are far away,   ♫

159
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:43,600
♫   we can console each other.    ♫

160
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,890
♫   Let's walk together.   ♫

161
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,260
What're you talking about?

162
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,000
There's something I'm curious about.

163
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,170
What are you bad at?

164
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,760
What would I be bad at?

165
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,780
You're so shameless.

166
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,360
Whenever I see the sunset, I'm reminded of my dad.

167
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,520
The image that I saw the most of my father when I was younger

168
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,610
was him standing in our yard with his hands behind his back, looking at the sunset.

169
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,470
I thought my father loved the sunset,

170
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,070
but I found out later

171
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:45,040
that what he was looking at wasn't the sunset,

172
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,260
but the western skies.

173
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,020
Why?

174
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:54,590
My mother went to a country in the west.

175
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,960
Wow, that's committment.

176
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,400
How romantic.

177
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,930
Thank you for this.

178
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,520
 To my daughter, Han Woo Joo

179
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:01,190
Before you read this letter, I have something to tell you.

180
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:08,810
In this moment, you should do whatever you want to do.

181
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:13,130
If you want to cry, cry. If you want to be angry, be angry.

182
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,300
I'm not going to cry or be angry.

183
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,040
If this was written in 1995,

184
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,830
then you were 8 years old?

185
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:33,560
When I was eight, I was living with my adoptive parents.

186
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,640
To my daughter, Woo Joo.

187
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:51,500
Do you know why your name is Woo Joo?

188
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:59,570
When you were born, you were like a universe to me. 
 (T/N 'woo joo' means universe in Korean)

189
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:06,140
For the 6 years we were together, every day was happiness.

190
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:14,240
Even now, I remember every single day of those six years.

191
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:30,790
 Woo Joo, let's go inside. Let's go.

192
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,710
 Woo Joo if you don't go inside, I'm going to get upset.

193
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,500
 Let's go.

194
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:45,170
 Woo Joo, come here.

195
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,800
 Sister, please take good care of her.

196
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,180
 Please don't worry.

197
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:58,850
 The day I left you with Sister Lucia,

198
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:02,300
 I went to the sea.

199
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,480
 That's where I wanted to die.

200
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:13,340
 But life is quite resilient.

201
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,480
 Sister Lucia, my Woo Joo...

202
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,800
 We cannot give you any information.

203
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,280
 I lived with all my might

204
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,540
 so I could bring you back at whatever the costs.

205
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,190
 Sister Lucia... please help me.

206
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,870
 - Please let me see her just once! 
- But living day by day...

207
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:39,170
 - was so overwhelming and difficult for me.
- Please let me see her just once!

208
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,650
 Woo Joo, what should I do?

209
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:45,780
 Your mom... came back too late.

210
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,900
 I ran here with all my might thinking I would be able to see you again,

211
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,520
 but you're not here.

212
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,110
 Still, I'm so relieved

213
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:00,130
 to hear that you've met good adoptive parents.

214
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:08,650
Woo Joo... you were a very kind child.

215
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:12,550
You never threw a fit.

216
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:17,950
You were a big consolation to your bad mother.

217
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,670
You were a gift to me.

218
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:24,350
Woo Joo, I'm sorry.

219
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:28,830
Mom should've come back sooner.

220
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:35,670
Will we be able to meet again someday?

221
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:41,930
- Dr. Lee... 
 - Mom will come look for you again.

222
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,750
I will definitely come back.

223
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,100
Mom...

224
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,560
My mom didn't abandon me.

225
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:59,380
I always thought my mom had abandoned me.

226
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,100
My mom didn't abandon me.

227
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,620
Will I be able to meet her someday?

228
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:17,400
Ms. Woo Joo, you've already met her again.

229
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,380
Yes.

230
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,340
Are you awake?

231
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,300
What time is it? Did I sleep for too long?

232
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,250
Not at all. Shall we head back now?

233
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,970
Yes.

234
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,630
Let's depart!

235
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,150
 To my daughter Han Woo Joo

236
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:26,200
 From Mom

237
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,220
Is there no good way to cure repressed anger?

238
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,820
She's been taking her drugs regularly.

239
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,830
Why did she run out into the street that day?

240
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,980
I think she wanted to tell everyone

241
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:51,630
how kind her son was.

242
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:55,620
Based on what she's told me, he really was a kind son.

243
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,030
A person shouldn't keep everything pent up inside...

244
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:01,990
There's a vet rehab center called "Together" that holds a gathering.

245
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,350
I told her to go there.

246
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:08,770
That's somewhere she could talk about her son as much as she wants.

247
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,850
- I'll look into it. 
 - Really?

248
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:15,260
Ji Young Won came all the way here to ask me for that favor. I can't just sit around and not help her.

249
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,540
Then you can help me for the month.

250
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,450
Well, does this turn into that?

251
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:24,350
Should I be grateful to you? For letting me meet a patient?

252
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,410
Commander, hello! This is Lee Si Joon.

253
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,820
How have you been?

254
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,770
I'm sorry for calling so suddenly.

255
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,790
I'm looking for someone, but they're in the military,

256
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,970
so I thought I would request some help from you.

257
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,980
Where should I put this?

258
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,160
I'll help you with these.

259
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:28,160
Just put it roughly in the right place. I have to reorganize it anyway.

260
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,490

261
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:53,330
I think this side is all done.

262
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,700
Then I'll be leaving now.

263
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:01,690
I came to say goodbye. I won't come here anymore.

264
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:07,650
Of course, I would love to see you and say hello from time to time...

265
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,990
but I won't come find you.

266
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,680
I'm sorry for everything up to now.

267
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:17,860
I'm sorry and I'm also grateful.

268
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:26,720
Thank you for raising and looking after me, though I was so ill.

269
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:33,470
Sure. Now that I see your face, it really seems like this is the last time.

270
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,530
Yes.

271
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:37,990
It's really the last time.

272
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:40,540
I'm sorry about last time as well.

273
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:45,390
I said things I shouldn't have said. I regretted it.

274
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:52,920
While raising you, it's not true that only bad things happened.

275
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:04,990
Thank you for saying that.

276
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,060
You should go now.

277
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,330
Mom... please be healthy.

278
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:21,220
You as well. Don't get sick.

279
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,880
Live well, with your mind at ease.

280
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:51,160
Please live well, Woo Joo.

281
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,960
Woo Joo... Han Woo Joo...

282
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,190
When you were born,

283
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,860
you were like a universe to me.

284
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:17,510
A universe...

285
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,250
Yes?

286
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,050
What is it?

287
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:37,760
We're planning on getting together for dinner to console Dr. Lee.

288
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,270
Would you like to come?

289
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,330
My attendance isn't really necessary there, is it?

290
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:44,870
We would like it if you would please come.

291
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:47,950
The Chief also said he would come.

292
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,120
I'll see if I have time.

293
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,210
I understand.

294
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,750
Hello, ma'am!

295
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,020
Welcome.

296
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,520
How did you find me?

297
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,630
I've served as a doctor in the military,

298
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:42,030
I made a big request of the on duty commander then.

299
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,860
Corporal Kim Byung Woo, who died three years ago,

300
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,730
was one of your men, correct? 
 - That's correct.

301
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:56,000
And he's been one of your men since he was a private. Is that right?

302
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,280
Yes, that's correct.

303
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,720
Then could I ask you for a favor?

304
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:12,980
Hello.

305
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:17,800
You all look like you're having fun. Are you going to some dinner event?

306
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,550
Cat got your tongue? Why aren't you answering?

307
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:26,030
We agreed to do a consolation event for Dr. Lee Si Joon.

308
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:30,120
A consolation event? What is there to console him for?

309
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,600
No, it's not so much of a consolation event,

310
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,750
but we're all just going to eat a meal with him.

311
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:39,330
It's been a while since we've all eaten out together.

312
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:41,130
Oh goodness, we'll be going then.

313
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,660
Would you like to come as well?

314
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,940
- I'm fine. 
 - Jang Yu Mi.

315
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,770
Do you know how busy the Vice President is? How could you ask him to come?

316
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,890
That puts him in a difficult situation!

317
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,190
I'm sorry.

318
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:01,060
We're very sorry. Our interns still lack some sense.

319
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,830
Then we'll be going.

320
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,940
What the heck? Are they intentionally leaving me out right now?

321
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,620
Who said I want to go?!

322
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,780
Goodness...

323
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:23,290
I'm going to Kong Rice House.

324
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:26,200
I have to go help Ji Sun, but I'm a bit late.

325
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,140
I'll see you later!

326
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,760
It's been 4 days, but I still haven't heard from you.

327
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,730
What do you want from me?

328
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:50,800
I know you're a drug addict. You confessed it all to my son!

329
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,620
Do you want to quit being a doctor?

330
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,520
Please do as you please.

331
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:02,060
How dare you disregard my words when all you are is a drug addict?

332
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,980
Won't you let go of this?

333
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,440
Let's meet again.

334
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:29,180

335
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:34,360
♫  Whew, take a deep breath out.  ♫

336
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,690
 Fix You

337
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:40,230
 Dr. In, I'm not the only one that takes these.

338
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,490
 Did something happen to Dong Hyuk?

339
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,210
 I do think something happened to him...

340
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:46,290
 Thank you, Si Joon, for being my son.

341
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:51,840
 A miracle wasn't so far away. This is what a miracle is.

342
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,350
 I've got news from Johns Hopkins University.

343
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,610
 Lee Si Joon, you answer me.

344
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:00,360
 Am I still taking medicine, or not?

345
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,220
♫  Whew, whew, whew, whew  ♫

346
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,000
♫  Whew, whew  ♫
