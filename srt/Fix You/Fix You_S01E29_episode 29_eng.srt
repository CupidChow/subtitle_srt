1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,290
What's going on?

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,270
Why is he trying to throw punches?

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,510
That's the person who caused a ruckus in your office last time, right?

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:19,510
This isn't some simple misunderstanding, is it?

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,260
Why won't you say anything? It's frustrating me!

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,960
He's threatening me right now.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,600
Threatening you?

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,170
With what?

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,860
Was a weakness of yours caught?

10
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,740
He couldn't threaten you with nothing.

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,270
Don't worry. There's no weakness of mine that got caught.

12
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,660
Then why... is he asking you if you're a drug addict?

13
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,340
I didn't hear something wrong, did I?

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,220
I don't think I'll be able to go to your consolation dinner. I'll be leaving now.

15
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,450
I'm asking why he called you a drug addict!

16
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,770
I don't know either! What wouldn't he try to say, when he's trying to threaten me?

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,280
I'll take care of it, so don't worry about it.

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,660
My friend is being threatened and almost got punched.

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,810
But don't worry about it?

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,000
I'll be going now.

21
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,280
Hey! Are you really just going to leave?

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,850

23
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,360

24
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,170
Dr. Lee!

25
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,570
Why are you out here?

26
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,580
I thought it was about time for you to get back.

27
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,110
How have you been?

28
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,680
Why don't you pick up the phone? I worried so much about you.

29
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,320
Why would you worry?

30
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,950
I stopped myself from going to your house.

31
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,670
Let's go in.

32
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,750
Dr. Lee is here!

33
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,140
Dr. Lee! Welcome.

34
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,380
Chief! You got here early.

35
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,010
- Dr. Lee! 
 - Have you all been well? Have a seat.

36
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,680
- Dr. Lee, Im Se Chan has not been well. 
 - Why not?

37
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,620
He always got emotional talking about your situation,

38
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,980
and almost even cried a few times.

39
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,690
Nu Ri was comparable to me!

40
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,800
- She would kick chairs asking what kind of crappy situation this was. 
 - I saw that, too.

41
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,180
Hey! When did I kick anything?

42
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,470
I only cursed a little bit.

43
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,120
Wow, Kang Nu Ri knows how to curse?

44
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,990
Woo Jung is the one who was most upset.

45
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,860
Dr. Lee. I looked over the patients in the ward with even more attention than before.

46
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,090
Me too!

47
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,700
We're checking in on the patients often and keeping good record of everything.

48
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,200
And we're keeping our uniforms clean.

49
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,870
Sure, sure. It sounds like you're all doing well.

50
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,910
Okay everyone, fill your glasses. Let's cheers.

51
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,860
Oh, right. Call Dr. In and see when he'll be coming.

52
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,950
Okay.

53
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,710
I don't think Dr. In will be able to make it today.

54
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:53,100
Oh, really? That's unfortunate.

55
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,810
Anyway, why don't we start now?

56
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:01,170
First! Dr. Lee, please say a few words.

57
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,010
Why do we have to do all that?

58
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,350
Goodness...

59
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,570
Okay, well. I want to thank you all.

60
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,970
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

61
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,400
No matter how angry you are, don't swear.

62
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,910
Okay. Now, well. Do you say anything special as a cheer?

63
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,970
When I say "Dr. Lee", we'll all say "Fighting!" Okay? 
 Dr. Lee,

64
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,520
- Fighting! 
 - Thank you.

65
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,800
Here you go. This is Ms. Kong's free service for you all.

66
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,390
Wow! Thank you!

67
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,340
- Thank you for the meal. 
 - Enjoy!

68
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,730
Thank you! We'll enjoy the meal.

69
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,070
 Dr. In, I'm not the only person that takes this.

70
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,620
 There are so many people at my academy who take this.

71
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,230
 They all say it helps us study.

72
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,650
 Jin Woo, all of that is a lie.

73
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,080
 Jin Woo...

74
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:20,010
 This medicine is for patients with ADHD,

75
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,590
 not something you can take before your exams.

76
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,280
 If you keep taking it, you could develop a dependency.

77
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,550
 When you get to high school, you'll want to take it again for all your tests. What about college? Do you not take tests in college?

78
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,090
 Even after you graduate and get a job, you'll create excuses to take it.

79
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:37,160
  Once you become dependent on medicine once, you become dependent on it forever.

80
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,220
 I'm confident that I won't become dependent on it.

81
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,310
 Jin Woo... That medicine,

82
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,390
 - I've taken it, too. 
 - What?

83
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:03,960
 That's why I know it so well. It's so hard to stop.

84
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,630
 Even if you don't have any more tests,

85
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:11,240
 even when you don't have a reason to come in first, or have any reasons to be stressed,

86
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,080
 you keep looking for it out of habit. It becomes habit.

87
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,390
 Do you want to become like that?

88
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,640
- Hey! 
 - Watch the steps.

89
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,900
♫ In life... ♫

90
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,840
Are we all heading to round 2?

91
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,910
Round 2? Sounds great! Let's go to round 2!

92
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,260
What do you mean, round 2? You all can go on to round 2. I'll take the Chief home.

93
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,820
Then I will take him.

94
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,480
It's okay. I can do it.

95
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,660
Damnit...

96
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,840
Thank you for the meal!

97
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,210
Head home safely.

98
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,470
Okay, see you!

99
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,750
- I'll take you home. 
 - Head home safely!

100
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,270
Head home safely!

101
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,590
Si Joon, I want to go to round 2.

102
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,990
Just let the young ones go together.

103
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,370
I should, right?

104
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,950
- Yes, you should. 
 - Just the young ones?

105
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,920
How could you not change one bit?

106
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,900
Let's get a drink together, then!

107
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,310
- Han Woo Joo. 
 - Kong Ji Sun!

108
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,010
Why are you in such a good mood?

109
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,580
Ji Sun, I have something to tell you.

110
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,760
I went to the orphanage.

111
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,010
- The orphanage? The place you used to live? 
 - Yes.

112
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,420
Why, all of a sudden? You've never been back since you left.

113
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,750
I suddenly...

114
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,140
thought that I needed to go.

115
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,790
I had something to find out about my past.

116
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:03,690
It's been more than 10 years. Did anyone there remember you?

117
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,370
It's not like they only had one or two kids.

118
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,850
- I got a letter from my mom. 
 - What?

119
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,090
They found a letter my mom wrote for me

120
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,690
in the late orphanage director's belongings.

121
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,720
What do you mean? Your birth mother wrote a letter for you?

122
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,420
When? When did she write it?

123
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:23,200
2 years after I got adopted, my mom came looking for me.

124
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,470
But I wasn't at the orphanage then,

125
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,420
so she left me a letter.

126
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:34,070
By the time I went back to the orphanage,

127
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:39,900
Sister Lucia probably couldn't bring herself to give me the letter then.

128
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,840
She must've kept it all these years.

129
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,100
After she passed away,

130
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,620
the letter was found in her belongings.

131
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,980
- Did you... read... the letter? 
 - Yes.

132
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,790
What did it say?

133
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,570
When I was born,

134
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,830
she said I was her whole universe.

135
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,600
That's why she named me Woo Joo.

136
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,870
To my mom,

137
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,970
I was a gift and consolation.

138
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,570
Then your mom didn't abandon you!

139
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,860
Nope. She didn't.

140
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,390
She just...

141
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,820
must've been in a tough situation.

142
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,010
I think so.

143
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,550
But I didn't know that before.

144
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,410
All the time I spent hurting and hating her feels wasted now.

145
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,120
I shouldn't have done that.

146
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,660
I should've just lived my life.

147
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,380
Miracles aren't so impossible after all.

148
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,810
This is a miracle.

149
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,060
You've been through a lot, Woo Joo.

150
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,550
What do you mean?

151
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,740
You hurt a lot, inside.

152
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:04,650
You should sleep at home. Why did you insist on coming back to the hospital?

153
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,640
At home, I can't sleep.

154
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,750
Why not?

155
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,230
The person I used to live with isn't there anymore, but her traces are.

156
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,260
That's so lonely.

157
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,770
Gosh... It's been so long since you've become a widower.

158
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,180
Yes, well...

159
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,390
If you drank, you should just go home. Why did you come here?

160
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:34,260
Oh, Vice President. What business do you have here so late?

161
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,760
I've never seen him stay here so late, right?

162
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,420
Do you think all I do is clean up other people's work?

163
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,700
I do research too!

164
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,140
Geez, why are you trying to pick a fight with me?

165
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,520
- Should I try knocking you over? Knock you over?
- What? What?

166
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,730
Chief! The chief is quite drunk right now, I'll escort him to his office.

167
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,490
Why is someone on probation here?

168
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,080
Don't you know you're not allowed to be here for a month?

169
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,560
Hey! Where are you going? Let me knock you over.

170
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:10,030
Si Joon, I'm fine. I'm okay. You should leave now, leave!

171
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,710
I will!

172
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:16,050
Goodness... You just go sleep at home.

173
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,750
Go home!

174
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,670

175
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,080
Didn't you leave earlier?

176
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,150
The Chief said he wanted to sleep at the hospital, so I just escorted him there.

177
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:49,300
I thought you might still be here.

178
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,580
Then, I'll head this way.

179
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,280
Head home, Dr. Lee. 
 See you tomorrow, Woo Joo.

180
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,930
Bye! Let's go, too.

181
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,330
Is Chief Park really sleeping at the hospital?

182
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,430
You look like you've had a drink.

183
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:12,230
The world looks so different for me now.

184
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,970
Really?

185
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:21,970
Yesterday, I said goodbye to my adoptive mom.

186
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,940
She told me that it really seemed like the last time.

187
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,970
Until now, even though I've gone to say goodbye multiple times,

188
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:37,130
I kept on going back to find her.

189
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,600
It's a bit...

190
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,290
sad, but also somehow relieving.

191
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,190
It does seem like the world would look different for you.

192
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,480
People look different, too.

193
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:59,350
The sky, the moon, the stars, the trees...

194
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,310
and even these buildings. It all looks different.

195
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:04,900
How do they look different?

196
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:10,490
Before, the world was above me,

197
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,560
so it was hard to get in there.

198
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,290
But now, it seems a lot closer. Like a friend.

199
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,150
That's why I'm going to do everything I wanted to try.

200
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:28,010
What did you want to try?

201
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:34,640
First, I want to go on a walk with the person I love, like this!

202
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,490
- And? 
 - And... it's a secret!

203
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,720
A secret?

204
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,520
I don't like secrets.

205
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,950
What is it? You're making me curious.

206
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,360
I can't tell you.

207
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,180
Let go, then.

208
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,580
 - What is this? 
 - It's nothing.

209
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,620
 Eun Kang Medical Center

210
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,860
The reason I asked you to see me is this.

211
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:16,840
The research you presented to the World Psychiatric Association

212
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,710
about the effect of combining anti-psychotic drugs and treatment,

213
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:24,980
and also about panic disorder patients and the effect of medication on them?

214
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,650
Yes. What about those papers?

215
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,340
I've been contacted by Johns Hopkins University.

216
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,840
They want you to come and conduct the research yourself.

217
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,410
- They sent an invitation. 
 - What?

218
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,830
The duration is one year. You do need a recommendation letter from the Hospital Director,

219
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,350
but I don't think that'll be difficult to get.

220
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:49,940
It's a good opportunity for you to just focus on your research for a year, so you should go.

221
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:57,610
- Why? 
 - Chief... I can't believe it!

222
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,840
You worked hard on it.

223
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,080
Who else at Eun Kang researched

224
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,340
and published papers as consistently as you?

225
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,300
- You're flattering me. 
 - What do you mean?

226
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,260
Last year, you even won Young Research Doctor of the Year!

227
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:19,270
I can ask the Hospital Director for her recommendation.

228
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,460
Thank you, Chief.

229
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:34,860
Jin Woo. Did you come to meet me?

230
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,980
I'm sorry I lied to my dad.

231
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:51,270
My mom didn't know about me taking medicine, but he kept hurting my mom.

232
00:16:52,170 --> 00:17:00,690
Jin Woo... Why do you keep breaking your promises with me? Where did you get the medicine?

233
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:06,810
I bought it off a friend. He got it off the internet.

234
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,330
How much have you taken?

235
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,980
I've had quite a bit.

236
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,790
So did you get first place?

237
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,570
No...

238
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,940
The test was today, but I felt so anxious

239
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:25,710
I couldn't even process anything I was reading.

240
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:30,840
I ended up vomiting on my papers during the test.

241
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:35,170
Jin Woo, let's get you hospitalized today.

242
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:39,770
We need your guardian's permission, so I'll contact your mother.

243
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,590
- You've got him from here?
- Yes.

244
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:52,170
Nurse Oh. The patient's guardian is on the way, and once they come we'll get their agreement to hospitalize the patient right away.

245
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,260
Dr. In said he would explain the patient's condition to his guardians himself.

246
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,910
What drugs shall we administer?

247
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:02,880
We'll have a consultation first, but we may have to prescribe benzodiazepines if his withdrawal symptoms don't get better.

248
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,830
Okay. Is there anything else I should be aware of?

249
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,060
Please keep checking his vitals,

250
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,620
and he may experience high levels of anxiety and restlessness.

251
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,400
If something happens, please call me.

252
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,350
- I'll do that. 
 - Thank you!

253
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:19,690

254
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,660
- What is it? I'm busy. 
 - I'm super busy too!

255
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,040
I just barely made time to come to a place I didn't even want to be.

256
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,250
What is it?

257
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,260
I want to continue our conversation from yesterday.

258
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:42,210
I just hospitalized Kang Jin Woo. We've resolved the misunderstanding that I prescribed it to him, so you don't need to worry.

259
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,490
Do you think I'm worried about your patient?

260
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,600
I'm worried about you.

261
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,900
The person yesterday... didn't seem like he would end it with a few threats.

262
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,950
Si Joon, can't you just pretend like you didn't see it?

263
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,800
I'm your friend, not your patient.

264
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,880
Is this something I can ignore?

265
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,040
My friend looks like he's about to get beat up.

266
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,150
Are you worried I actually might be taking some kind of medicine right now?

267
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:09,410
Is that what you want to know?

268
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:13,980
I saw something when we were 4th year residents.

269
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,410
I know you're very thoughtful,

270
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,160
and I know you don't like talking about much either.

271
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,660
I just thought if I just ignore it, you'll resolve everything well on your own.

272
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,410
But... this time I need to hear it myself.

273
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:33,050
- It's unlike you. Why? 
 - Because you did this, too.

274
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:39,010
You told me what the Vice President was trying to do, for my sake.

275
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,620
If you need time, then I'll wait.

276
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,880
Let's end the consultation here for today. Shall we get up?

277
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:59,400
Dr. Ji, today, can't you extend today's consultation

278
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,630
to include what we would've done next week?

279
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:05,390
Is there something more you want to say?

280
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,750
It's not that.

281
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,940
Today's Dae Woong's death anniversary.

282
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:18,360
My husband and my daughter are both coming home late today.

283
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,110
They probably didn't want to see me crying.

284
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,950
You must not want to go home.

285
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:30,370
I think it'd be good to talk about those feelings in our next consultation.

286
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,750
In our next... consultation?

287
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,930
Yes. Let's talk about that next time.

288
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:38,210
Today, I'll walk you out.

289
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:46,700
It's so sad to think that Dae Woong is slowly being forgotten.

290
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,670
Young Won!

291
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:55,150
What brings you here?

292
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:59,050
I was in the area because I had business to care for, but now I'll be heading back.

293
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,950
This is my friend.

294
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:04,370
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

295
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,430
Dr. Ji, then I'll-

296
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:11,430
Wait a minute. My friend lives in the same neighborhood as you. You can get a ride from him.

297
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,340
Really? Sure, I'll give you a ride.

298
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:18,580
It's okay. I can get on the subway right down there.

299
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,390
You should just get a ride. It'll be busy if you ride the subway.

300
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,090
You can get in.

301
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,550
It's really okay...

302
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,220
Shall I turn on some music for you?

303
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,360
I really like this song.

304
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,320
Really?

305
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,870
I haven't been able to listen to it for a while.

306
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,250
Why not? Why couldn't you listen to it?

307
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,830
It reminded me of my son.

308
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:05,280
My son would play this on the guitar for me

309
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:11,050
on my birthdays, since it's a song I liked.

310
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,740
Your son is so kind.

311
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,720
What do you mean kind? He's a bad son.

312
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,900
He left his mom here and left for Heaven.

313
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:26,930
But it's still nice to listen to this song. It's been so long.

314
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:32,120
♫  That's your shadow.  ♫

315
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:39,300
♫  Now, it's the shadow of my love that's disappeared.  ♫

316
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,660
Thanks to you, I really enjoyed the song.

317
00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:00,180
It was a song I haven't been able to listen to, but now that I have, I feel relieved.

318
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,920
- Head in safely. 
 - Thank you.

319
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,430
Goodbye.

320
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,080
Oh, Dae Woong's mom! Are you just getting back?

321
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,850
Yes.

322
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:24,830
I had something I wanted to tell you when I saw you.

323
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:29,790
A little bit ago, the light in my store was blinking,

324
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,580
and I suddenly thought of Dae Woong.

325
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,470
My Dae Woong?

326
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:38,710
Dae Woong's changed the light in our store a few times.

327
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,100
He was so tall!

328
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,300
Wasn't he about 180cm?

329
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:51,460
Yes. Dae Woong suddenly grew a ton in middle school.

330
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:58,150
Isn't today his death anniversary?

331
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,940
One minute.

332
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:22,380
Here. I'm giving this to you for Dae Woong.

333
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:31,340
How do you even remember his death anniversary?

334
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,690
Thank you for remembering my son.

335
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:42,650
How could I forget Dae Woong?

336
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,290
Stay strong.

337
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:49,790
Thank you.

338
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,910
 - Hello, Ma'am! 
 - Hello.

339
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:59,010
 I had something to ask you. Do you know of Kim Dae Woong?

340
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:02,130
 Of course.

341
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:05,580
 - Unfortunately, he passed a few years ago. 
 - I know, it was so unfortunate.

342
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:24,960
Lieutenant Colonel, right? You came to our Dae Woong's funeral.

343
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,520
- You remember me. 
 - Of course.

344
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,180
You helped me so much.

345
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,130
But... what brings you here?

346
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,320
I was about to head in after taking care of some business,

347
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,370
but I remembered it was soldier Kim Dae Woong's death anniversary, so I wanted to stop by.

348
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:45,590
Thank you so much for remembering Dae Woong's death anniversary.

349
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,530
Thank you.

350
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,180
Would you like to come in for a bit?

351
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,170
That's alright.

352
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,170
Soldier Kim Dae Woong really loved to eat.

353
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:59,670
I don't know what he was eating, but he was always chewing on something.

354
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:04,010
At first, I used to ask him why he ate so much,

355
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:09,540
but soon I realized that I had also started constantly chewing on something following him.

356
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:15,200
Dae Woong basically lived to eat.

357
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,970
The instant coffee soldier Kim made for me was always watered down.

358
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:22,980
It tasted so bland because he didn't know how much water to put in,

359
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:28,620
but sometimes I miss the bland coffee he used to make me.

360
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:35,380
Once, he was late coming back from a vacation break, so the entire unit went crazy saying he had left the military.

361
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:42,430
Turns out that he was late helping an emergency patient on the train coming back to the military base,

362
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:46,680
even though he knew he could've been misunderstood as a run-away soldier.

363
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:49,670
That dummy.

364
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:55,480
Soldier Kim Dae Woong always thought of others before himself.

365
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,930
He even shared his extra holidays with his fellow soldiers

366
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:06,440
and donated half of his earnings. He would help his fellow soldiers carry their belongings.

367
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:15,600
I will forever remember soldier Kim Dae Woong.

368
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:33,320
Thank you so much.

369
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:38,290
Thank you for helping me today.

370
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:42,750
I think I'm the one that needs to be thanking you. It was very fulfilling.

371
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,150
Thank you.

372
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:52,970
Right... You said you worked at Eun Kang Hospital, right?

373
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,610
I know a doctor at that hospital.

374
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,780
Oh, really?

375
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,840
I'll be heading back then.
