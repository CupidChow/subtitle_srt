1
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,850

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:20,710

3
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,720
He came to the emergency room himself, early in the morning.

4
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,930
Oh Yoo Min, does it hurt a lot?

5
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,030
I asked for the orthopedic surgeon, not you.

6
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,170
Why are you suddenly asking for a new doctor?

7
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,030
It hurts even when I graze it?

8
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,500
For now, I'll give you some pain medicine.

9
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,900
Did you get here on crutches?

10
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,290
What else could I do? I can't walk, it hurts so much.

11
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,280
Just call the orthopedic surgeon for me.

12
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,630
Why do you keep asking for the orthopedic surgeon?

13
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,770
I'm just going to cut my leg off.

14
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,960
What?

15
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,710
I can't kick any balls with this leg anyway. I'd rather cut it off than limp around everywhere.

16
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,880
What is a soccer player going to do without his leg? Are you going to quit soccer?

17
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,470
I'm not quitting, I can't play because it hurts so much!

18
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,460
How can I play soccer with a leg like this?

19
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,630
That's true... What good is soccer if your body is in pain?

20
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:48,670
Contact the orthopedic department.

21
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,690
I did earlier, but they said he'd have to wait at least a month.

22
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,830
What should we do?

23
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,730
Oh well. I guess I'll have to cut it for you.

24
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,970
Y-You?

25
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,990
How can a psychiatrist do surgery?

26
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,370
Why couldn't I? I can fix minds, you think I can't cut a leg?

27
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,300
You made the right decision. Let's just cut it off.

28
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,770
You can't play soccer anyways, and all it does is hurt. There's no use to it!

29
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,280
I'll cut it off nicely for you, okay?

30
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,050
Prosthetics are so good these days, you won't even need crutches.

31
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,980
Okay. Let's get ready for surgery.

32
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,730
- Yes, sir.
- Go!

33
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,040
Wait, wait. What are you doing?

34
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,140
You need to get surgery.

35
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,340
- Please wait one moment.
 - Wait!

36
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,040
Why are you tying me up?

37
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,680
No, no, no, no!

38
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,190
Stop! No!

39
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,310
No, no, no!

40
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,380
You didn't really think I'd cut it here, did you?

41
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,310
Move him to the operating room.

42
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,430
Wait, where are we going?

43
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,010
Are you really going to cut it?

44
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:38,140
I don't think this is right. Wait.

45
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,850
Let me go!

46
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,060
Oh Yoo Min!

47
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,350
Don't follow me!

48
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,090
Mr. Oh Yoo Min!

49
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,050
Patient! Please come back!

50
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,080
Sorry.

51
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:33,010
They are not in their right mind. They're crazy.

52
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,910
Oh Yoo Min!

53
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,710
You forgot these.

54
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,300
You were running so fast! You were like an MVP.

55
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,950
It's called somatic symptom disorder.

56
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:57,020
You're physically fine, but feel pain due to a nervous system disfunction.

57
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,020
That's what you've had this whole time.

58
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,820
Every time you lose a game, you lose confidence, which leads to worse performance.

59
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,720
Your leg, which is fine, starts to feel pain induced by high levels of stress.

60
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,630
I don't know since when, but I started fearing the soccer ball.

61
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,320
Who cares if your performance isn't the best. Is that worse than losing your leg?

62
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,120
There's nobody in the world who doesn't make mistakes.

63
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,940
Think about it. During the Korea-Japan match in Tokyo,

64
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,880
you dribbled past three defenders,

65
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,620
for a distance longer than 60 meters!

66
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,060
Then right between the goal keeper's legs, you just—!

67
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:39,510
While I was watching through the TV, I thought my heart was going to burst.

68
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,110
You were so cool.

69
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:50,330
You've been a great player more times than you've made mistakes.

70
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,710
You think people call you Golden Left Foot for nothing?

71
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:59,490
Golden Left Foot, Oh Yoo Min!

72
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,780
Golden Left Foot, Oh Yoo Min!

73
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,050
Golden Left Foot! Oh Yoo Min!!

74
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:19,830
♫  The hometown is Namwon  ♫

75
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:26,090
♫  Where Chunhyang once lived  ♫

76
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:33,530
♫  At just sixteen  ♫

77
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:40,550
♫  Young and innocent  ♫

78
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:52,450
♫   A morning covered in heavy fog,   ♫

79
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:59,440
♫   We were dragged away   ♫

80
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:06,280
♫  For what reasons? Where?  ♫

81
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:13,830
♫  Nobody answers me  ♫

82
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:20,360
♫  Like this country's land, which has all been taken  ♫

83
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:27,440
♫  Our fate will follow the same path  ♫

84
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,540
It was my first performance as the main character, after 10 years of playing small roles.

85
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,370
Who were those people?

86
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,420
They're fans of Jennie Baek, the idol. She was double casted alongside me.

87
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,090
Why did the fans do that?

88
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:43,260
They thought I was threatening their idol.

89
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,640
Is that true?

90
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:49,120
They turned the dressing room into a pigsty. Do they have no conscience?

91
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,870
 It was so good!

92
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,770
I'm the only one that ever cleans.

93
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,990
 You were so cool in that one!

94
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,070
 No way!

95
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:02,590
What frustrated me the most was that they ripped up my costume, and didn't even bother to fix it.

96
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,800

97
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,650

98
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,460
Rotten wrench.

99
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,710
Ever since then, I was named an enemy.

100
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:36,050
For the two months we had performances, I thought I was going crazy because of them.

101
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:42,120
♫  Lost in the foggy morning   ♫

102
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:51,810
♫  At the end of this long journey,  ♫

103
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:58,060
♫  We were left behind   ♫

104
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,690
They bought tickets, but didn't show up. It was totally meant to offend me.

105
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:09,630
If it's this bad, don't you think my anger is justified?

106
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,250
Of course you should be angry.

107
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,100
The issue is how you choose to deal with that anger.

108
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,300
That's true...

109
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:27,660
Doctor, you told me once... when I get angry, try to hold it in for 6 seconds.

110
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,030
I didn't know 6 seconds was such a long time.

111
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,490
 It's so good.

112
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,530
 You looked so cool.

113
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,930
 You're the best!

114
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:40,040
 Really!

115
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,450
 One... two...

116
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,160
 Three...  
 I should've kept it in until the end.

117
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,040
Have you been angry at anything else lately?

118
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,920
I saw a child crying on the street.

119
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,060
His mom had left him on the street.

120
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,580
 Let's go find your mom.

121
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,220
 Let's go.

122
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,120
 Hey! Excuse me!

123
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,780
 How could you leave your child out on the street?

124
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,460
 What does it have to do with you?

125
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,350
 What does it have to do with me?

126
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,180
 Do you want your child to think his own mother left him?

127
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,680
 I'll raise my child my own way.

128
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,560
 I'm interfering because you're not doing it well your way!

129
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,650
She said she did it as punishment.

130
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:32,880
Woo Joo, why do you think you wanted to help the child?

131
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,670
You've said so before, right?

132
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:39,100
That your life is divided into before and after you turned six years old.

133
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,960
If it's alright with you, can we talk about those times?

134
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,630
What does this have to do with my past?

135
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,590
It won't help you to keep avoiding it.

136
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:51,060
I'm not avoiding it.

137
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,950
I'll head out for today.

138
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,080
Your appointment isn't over yet.

139
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:12,730

140
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:27,120

141
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,280

142
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,600

143
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,450

144
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,510

145
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,770

146
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,720

147
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:43,310

148
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,100

149
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,920
Sir, you cannot urinate there.

150
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,150
Sir!

151
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,870
Gosh...

152
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,710
Sir, are you okay? I'm the police. Do you need any assistance?

153
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,100
I'm not... I'm not drunk.

154
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,300
He really must be drunk, if he's claiming he isn't.

155
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,010
I'm not! I'm telling you, I'm not drunk at all.

156
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,720
Where do you live? We'll call a taxi for you.

157
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,500
I'm telling you, it's fine. I'm not drunk at all!

158
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,770
I said I'm not drunk...

159
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:54,270
Shall we head in as well? I think it's time for the next shift.

160
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,940
Officer Cha Dong Il from Eunpyeong reporting back to the station, over.

161
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,620
Good work today, Officer Cha Dong Il.

162
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,040
Good work today. Thank you.

163
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,950
Stop right there!

164
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,490
Are you okay?

165
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,460
My bag...

166
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,680
Hey! Stop right there!

167
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,240
You punk!

168
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,400
Get out of the way!

169
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,390
Move!

170
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,620
Stop running!

171
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,060
- He's over here! 
 - Dammit!

172
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,080
Stop!

173
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,990
I said stop!

174
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,100
Don't move. I said don't move!

175
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,850
Don't move.

176
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,660
Don't you dare...

177
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,430
It was a mistake.

178
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:54,830
I was aiming for his knife, but because of my long legs,

179
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,320
my foot ended up near his head...

180
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:05,530
Anyway, he seemed fine. He was taken to the police station right away.

181
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,660
What were you doing there?

182
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,990
I just happened to be there. Coincidentally.

183
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:17,120
- You just happened to be passing by, and coincidentally met a runaway patient?  
 - I guess so.

184
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,470
He's run away a few times already, hasn't he? You've known this, but remained a bystander.

185
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,110
That's... a misunderstanding.

186
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:33,930
What are you doing, playing cop with a patient who has a delusional disorder?

187
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,680
I heard that you often chat with your other patients as well!

188
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:41,510
That's to  befriend them faster, so they will open up to me.

189
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,400
Please file a report to the disciplinary committee. I cannot let this slide.

190
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,880
Does something like this warrant a report to the disciplinary committee?

191
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,320
That patient needed 6 weeks to recover from injuries he sustained

192
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,100
from using too much force in catching a sex offender at a subway station a month ago.

193
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,060
Two weeks ago, he went into a bar and arrested minors for drinking.

194
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,090
The bystander in all these events is you!

195
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:05,220
Sir, it wasn't six weeks.

196
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,620
It was just two.

197
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,330
Transfer that patient to a different center immediately.

198
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,710
Are you telling me to abandon my patient?

199
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:26,180
Psychiatrists, on average, are responsible for 60 patient appointments a day.

200
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,450
You have other patients on top of that. Why are you so attached to this one?

201
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:35,010
Then why don't we decrease the number of patients?

202
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,710
Excuse me, sir.

203
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:42,590
Won't it be fine as long as the patient is no longer prematurely discharged?

204
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:51,080
Dr. Lee, do you agree to never prematurely discharge this patient?

205
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,710
Do you agree?

206
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,830
- Yes. 
 - If this issue comes up again,

207
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,580
will you transfer him then?

208
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,390
I'll do that.

209
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:18,630
Since he agrees, let's wrap up by promising to transfer him if the patient runs away again.

210
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:23,920
I'm not just going out on patrol with Cha Dong Il to have fun.

211
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,780
It's rare for patients with delusional disorder

212
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,830
to maintain such a strong sense of identity, like Cha Dong Il.

213
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,150
As you're aware, patients with  delusional disorder don't often trust their doctors.

214
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,940
I'm doing this all to build a rapport with him. You can't prohibit me from trying.

215
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:42,900
Cha Dong Il is in a state of panic right now. He's shocked that he cannot be on patrol.

216
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:49,440
Then I guess you need to take him out on patrol.

217
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,090
Can I do that?

218
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,360
Sure.

219
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,430
I'll have cars ready for his immediate transfer.

220
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,790
Is this a threat or something?

221
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:05,210
You've established a good enough rapport, so stop talking about going on patrol.

222
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:09,710
Follow procedure, and put him on medication.

223
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,310

224
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,940
Has he been like that all day?

225
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,140
He won't even eat.

226
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,070
He's protesting because he can't go out on patrol anymore.

227
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,600
He'll eat when he gets hungry.

228
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,280
Did the dermatology department request a consultation?

229
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,700
Yes, a little bit ago.

230
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,850
What kind of patient?

231
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,850
 The next patient, this way please.

232
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,880
You shouldn't do this.

233
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,340
Please stop.

234
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,720
Please don't spray that on your arm.

235
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,460
Let go of me!

236
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:29,420
The patient believes that bugs live in her body.

237
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,590
Her delusions are a bit extreme.

238
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:36,470
Kim Yu Ra, aged 29. She was diagnosed at her local hospital for contact induced dermatitis.

239
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:40,060
She was prescribed diphenhydramine and steroid induced ointments,

240
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,940
but ultimately was referred to our hospital because her symptoms did not improve.

241
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,370
The head dermatologist determined it was not dermatitis

242
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:50,550
and suggested a psychiatric assessment, which the patient vehemently denied.

243
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:55,690
She was readmitted three months after this incident, and has been assigned to our department.

244
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:59,890
There is a high probability that this patient suffers from a delusional disorder, specifically delusional parasitosis.

245
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,040
Based on the condition of her skin, it looks like she applied something to it.

246
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:07,790
That's correct. From disinfectant and herbicides to pesticides. She used anything she thought could get rid of bugs.

247
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,330
Then shouldn't we suspect an addiction to pesticides as well?

248
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:16,700
Good observation. She also shows signs of frequent coughs and difficulty in breathing. How should we start treating this patient?

249
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,310
We should first stabilize the patient with medication.

250
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,890
Since the majority of patients experiencing physiological delusions also suffer from anxiety,

251
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,970
medical sedatives with benzodiazepines would be best.

252
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,920
To my knowledge, the treatment of choice for patients suffering from delusional disorders is antipsychotics.

253
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:38,210
Would it really benefit the patient to just medicate them,

254
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,490
without first establishing any sort of rapport?

255
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:46,830
That's why I think it would be best to conduct a psychological consultation first.

256
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:52,510
Would a patient denying any sort of psychiatric assessment agree to a psychological consultation?

257
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,030
What if we had a consultation with her guardian?

258
00:20:55,030 --> 00:21:02,400
I think her skin will be gone by the time we can get that done.

259
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,850
In this case, it might be best to go out and investigate.

260
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:09,670
Try to find out what she's been through.

261
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,130
Why are you just sitting there then?

262
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:17,200
We'll be on our way.

263
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,550
Work hard.

264
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,820
Yes, sir.

265
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,710
If all goes well, we may get some psychological results.

266
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:37,780
That's your method. My patient, my ways.

267
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,600
See you later.

268
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,130
I came to the hospital for dermatology, not psychiatry.

269
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:52,000
Are you saying I'm a psycho or something?

270
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,150
We are just checking in case you are living with a mental illness. There is no reason to feel defensive.

271
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:05,090
I'll just ask you a few questions, and then you can be off to the dermatology department.

272
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,340
You mentioned that bugs keep crawling out of your skin?

273
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:16,460
Yes, but the dermatologist doesn't believe me.

274
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,090
Since when has this been happening?

275
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,780
Since almost three months ago.

276
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:27,620
Did you happen to go through a traumatic experience around that time?

277
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:34,020
Are you trying to tell me this is all because of a bit of stress?

278
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,020
Not at all.

279
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,230
This is so annoying.

280
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,900
What are you doing!

281
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,380
I'm done now. One moment, please.

282
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,410
Can you take a look at this picture?

283
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,810
You don't see any bugs in this picture, do you?

284
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,290
I think you're the only person that can see those bugs.

285
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:19,650
Shall we try to figure out why this may have happened?

286
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:23,000
You're trying to tell me that I'm crazy, right?

287
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,990
- It's not that— 
 - Who are you kidding?

288
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,860
Kim Yu Ra, the patient from the dermatology department. Admit her to a room immediately.

289
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,960
I understand.

290
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,070
Are we admitting her to the psychiatric wing?

291
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:52,060
She's in strong denial, so put her in a normal patient room for now.

292
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,280
Okay.

293
00:23:53,280 --> 00:24:00,000
♫ Where, for what reasons? ♫

294
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:08,520
♫ Nobody will tell me  ♫

295
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,850
You said idols get paid $70,000 per episode.

296
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:23,950
We're getting paid $70 per episode.

297
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:27,380
Is it really too much to ask for $20 more per episode?

298
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,930
We don't even get paid to practice.

299
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:33,250
We're paying for everything during practice, even food.

300
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:37,840
This won't do. You should all just quit.

301
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:44,970
Instead of arguing, why don't you just quietly pack your things and leave?

302
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:49,160
You can't just do this. The performance is only a few weeks away.

303
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,250
You're really too much...

304
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:55,100
Don't worry about the performance. It'll be easy to replace them.

305
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,170
That's why you're only worth $70.

306
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:02,160
Idols cannot be replaced. That's why they're $70,000.

307
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,300
Unfair, huh?

308
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,420
If it's so unfair, then work hard and get famous yourselves, instead of being pathetic whiners.

309
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:10,560
Sir, you can't make a  production like this.

310
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,100
No matter how small their roles may be, they have pride as people!

311
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,630
Han Woo Joo, you've changed a lot.

312
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:22,310
Now that you've finally scored a lead role after 10 years, are you afraid of nothing?

313
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:26,310
Who are you trying to order around about production?

314
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,650
That's not what I meant...

315
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:31,920
Who helped you score the lead role and who helped you become nominated for rookie of the year?

316
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,560
Watch what you say. Your future depends on it.

317
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,700
Ah, really!

318
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,380
Eat up.

319
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,650
Chew carefully.

320
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:07,920
My phone got cut off, and he's about to get kicked out of his study dorm. 
(T/N: Study dorms are the cheapest, smallest rentable living spaces available.)

321
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,050
What should we do...

322
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:15,440
We barely made it by, thanks to you. You always bought us food and paid for our transportation.

323
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,870
Thank you. We won't forget it.

324
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:27,400
Why are you crying?

325
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:33,500
I suddenly remembered that you bought gloves for me last winter.

326
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,890
Telling me I wasn't dressed warm enough for the weather...

327
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,830
Don't cry over that. I gave you used ones.

328
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,910
That made me really... warm.

329
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:48,300
You guys should never quit, okay?

330
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,990
Ji Sun, can you give us some strong alcohol? Let's knock them out cold.

331
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:55,470
Can you give us some warm soup, too?

332
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,900
Hey, control yourself.

333
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,490
Cha Dong Il, you haven't even eaten?

334
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:14,530
Why are you being like this?

335
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,770
Should I order some pizza for you?

336
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,880
Leave him be!

337
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:28,170
What a tough time, trying to suppress your hunger.

338
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:47,690
I'll get put on probation if I don't go on patrol.

339
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:50,610
Do you know how hard it was to become a policeman?

340
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:53,650
Why did you want to be a police officer?

341
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,060
It's cool.

342
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,570
I had a friend like you.

343
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,600
A friend like me?

344
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:15,470
He grew up with his grandmother because his parents passed away early. They were also quite poor.

345
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:19,070
Was it when he was 15?

346
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:23,000
He got caught stealing bread from the convenience store because he was hungry.

347
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,990
A policeman helped him avoid getting placed in juvenile detention.

348
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:34,100
From that moment on, he dreamed of becoming a policeman.

349
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:40,240
But he kept failing his exams because he had to study while working part time jobs.

350
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:47,260
Eventually, his grandmother passed away before he was able to become a policeman.

351
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,870
She passed away in a DUI accident.

352
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:58,570
At her funeral, he wanted to grant his grandmother's wish,

353
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,580
so he wore a police uniform that he stole.

354
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:09,750
Then he kept that uniform on even after the funeral, and started to feel like a real policeman.

355
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:15,430
Since then, he started believing he was actually a policeman.

356
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,760
You know who this story is about, right?

357
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:53,900
I know it's hard to listen to this.

358
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,490
You know that you're not a policeman.

359
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:06,700
Why do you keep telling me I'm not a policeman?

360
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:14,130
I have to go on patrol. Let me out now.

361
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:23,720
You can't go on patrol anymore. I won't let you.

362
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,790
You want to go on patrol, right?

363
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,720
Then all you have to do is become a real policeman.
