1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:11,500
♫  I am a heart that is easily forgotten  ♫

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,730

3
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,490
♫  You know those lonely hearts that cannot be comforted?  ♫

4
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,400
Yes?

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,750
I am not a police officer. I am not a police officer.

6
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,720
I am not a police officer. Not a police officer.

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,970
I am not a police officer. I am not a police officer.

8
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,350
Has he been like that all day?

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,560
It seems he's struggling with himself.

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,970
And unexpected odd actions have decreased.

11
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:52,100
Unlock him for a while. Cha Dong Il will have to take a trip outside.

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,210
Where will you take him now?

13
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,130
Not far.

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,650
Where are we going now?

15
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,910
I thought maybe you can use some fresh air, you seem a bit down.

16
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,960
Come on, you know you like it.

17
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,800
That person, from last time...

18
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,480
Right?

19
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,510
Han Woo Joo,

20
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,890
what are you doing there? It's dangerous.

21
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,220
Please come down from there, that is really dangerous.

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,490
It's all because of you.

23
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,240
Because of you, it's all over for me.

24
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,010
Because of you, I can no longer live as a musical actress.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,090
But that was my entire life.

26
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,540
So there is no longer any reason to live.

27
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:11,300
Ah... ah... please calm down and get down from there. This is not right.

28
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,210
I'm sure that there is a solution. And if you die, nothing will change.

29
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,930
I'll see about that after I am dead.

30
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,520
Oh, oh, Ms. Woo Joo, please come down. This really is dangerous.

31
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,840
Please... Oh, please... you mustn't do this.

32
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,050
What policeman in the world would arrest someone during an awards ceremony?

33
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,800
No policeman would lack common sense like that.

34
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,060
Ah... I... Oh, please.

35
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,060
But I will not resent you.

36
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,060
You are a sick person, after all.

37
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,500
I hope that you will become a real policeman someday.

38
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,680
Ah... no. You cannot die because of me.

39
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,500
Ah, really... really... I am really sorry.

40
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,220
I knew it when the doctor gave me the corporal badge...

41
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,420
that I...

42
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,880
am not a policeman.

43
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,690
So you must not die over someone like me.

44
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:56,130
Please don't die. I'm so sorry, I'm really sorry.

45
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,480
I am really sorry.

46
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,250
- Want to work part-time at our hospital?
 - What?

47
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,200
We need actors for role-play therapy, like today.

48
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:49,500
Ah, I already graduated from those kinds of part-time acting jobs when I was unknown.

49
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,700
I guess you don't know yet, but I'm actually quite well-known now.

50
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,360
Ah, right. I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

51
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,950
I am really grateful for your help today.

52
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,320
I thank you, too.

53
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,590
I was depressed all day after a bad audition. But strangely, I feel really good now.

54
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,120
Is that so?

55
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,170
So what happens to him now?

56
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:30,230
Is psychiatry, we consider disorders a disability.

57
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,720
In English, "disorder." In other words, that they are broken.

58
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:40,120
To put it another way, they aren't working properly at present, but they can become normal after they are fixed.

59
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,630
And because you fixed Cha Dong Il today, he will become okay.

60
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,300
Do you have time tomorrow?

61
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,030
Why?

62
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,040
I am indebted to you for today. Let me treat you to a meal.

63
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,450
If you feel burdened, you can refuse.

64
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,750
Sounds good.

65
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,460
Yes, who is on overnight duty in the ER tonight?

66
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,020
I can substitute instead.

67
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,450
What? Why can't I?

68
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,240
The emergency department doctor said something?

69
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:05,140
Well, then it can't be helped. Okay.

70
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,400
What do you want to eat?

71
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,800
- Doctor.
 - Hello.
 - Hello.

72
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,620
Leaving work?

73
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,550
Yes. We're all going for a drink together, it's been so long.

74
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,140
Oh, yes, it's good to have a night out once in a while. Be on your way.

75
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,240
Bye.

76
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,140
Uh, Doctor?

77
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:38,500
You don't have to visit the ward, I already checked everything.

78
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:47,100
And if you keep going there at night, it makes the nurses a little uncomfortable.

79
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,320
Of course, I got it.

80
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,510
Please sleep at home tonight.

81
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,570
What's up?

82
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,570
I'm having drinks.

83
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,210
Can I join you?

84
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,720
I don't think so.

85
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,050
Got it.

86
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,450
- Sorry about that.
 - Have a seat.

87
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,690
Yes.

88
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,890
So I heard Lee Si Joon begged and pleaded with the Hospital Director?

89
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,640
Well, Director has always been very tolerant.

90
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,250
But the Director should protect her image, why did she let him slide? Her term is up soon, anyway.

91
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:12,320
Lee Si Joon does have a good image, he even received a few big awards. I think the Mayo Clinic even asked him to come last year?

92
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,690
Isn't that right?

93
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,360
He may be odd, but he is a skilled doctor.

94
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:23,560
Doctor In, you really are a humble person.

95
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,040
But why didn't Lee Si Joon go? If he went, he could have become an attending doctor right away.

96
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,380
Because he's a psycho.

97
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,800
Oh, right.

98
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,080
- Vice Director, congratulations in advance.
 - What for?

99
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,590
The new psychiatry center that is opening soon.

100
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:49,150
Rumors abound that our Vice Director is up to become the first head of that center.

101
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,460
What type of nonsense is that? Don't say such nonsense.

102
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,580
I don't have any interest in that.

103
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,840
- Congratulations.
  - Congratulations!

104
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,310
Oh, even you, Doctor In? What's with you?

105
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,240
Let's live.

106
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,040
Let's live. Live, live.

107
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,770
Live, live, live.

108
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,390
Let's live.

109
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,310
Have a cup of coffee.

110
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,310
Where did Dr. Lee Si Joon go?

111
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:49,840
He had something important come up, so he asked me to meet all of his patients today.

112
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,470
Is that what he called me?

113
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,450
A patient?

114
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm not a patient.

115
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,640
I apologize.

116
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,970
How have you been feeling? You experienced quite a lot recently. Has it not been too difficult?

117
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,180
Why do you keep treating me like a patient?

118
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,570
That's not what I'm doing.

119
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,650
If you felt that way, I'll apologize.

120
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,130
I must have really upset you.

121
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:20,150
Yes, I am feeling like total crap.

122
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,640
She just left.

123
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,700
One...

124
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,410
Two...

125
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,630
Three.

126
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,340
Four.

127
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,380
That jerk.

128
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,770
She doesn't think she's a patient.

129
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,430
She maintained high levels of anger.

130
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:01,840
She went through a breakup recently. I'm sure the betrayal from that is impacting her as well.

131
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,510
It seems like it'll be harder than you thought.

132
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:08,760
I don't think this is a simple case of Intermittent Explosive Disorder. I think the source of her symptoms is from something else.

133
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,420
Really? Does anything come to mind?

134
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,180
I'll have to look into it carefully, since Young Won asked me to.

135
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,210
Good choice.

136
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,780
He catches on quick.

137
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,880
Thanks for today!

138
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,210

139
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:44,950
What are you doing? I'm hungry.

140
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,130
Hey, you've already eaten this much.

141
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:51,190
It's like there's a beggar sitting in your stomach.

142
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:57,710
Ji Sun. I'm hungry no matter how much I eat.

143
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,000
It's because you feel empty inside. But you can't fix that with food.

144
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,880
You said so yourself. You'll just consider it an accident.

145
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,320
Should I tell Reporter Hwang to come? Why isn't your boyfriend trying to help you?

146
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,510
I broke up with that jerk.

147
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,400
What? When?

148
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,550
I found out he was a two-timer.

149
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,460
He's the one who wrote that article about me, actually.

150
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,070
Why do I have such bad luck?

151
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,040
Am I asking for too much?

152
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,290
I just want to live like other people.

153
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,450
Is that so hard?

154
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,240
I guess it's because I wasn't born like other people?

155
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,520
Hey! Where else could you find someone as kind and pretty as yourself?

156
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,090
You're just a bit of a meddler, that's all.

157
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,280
What frustrates me the most is, you know Dr. Lee Si Joon, right?

158
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,280
Ji Hye's superior? What about him?

159
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,830
That guy, all he did was use me.

160
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,650
He didn't seem like he would do that.

161
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,020
Do you have a plastic bag?

162
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,210
Why a plastic bag all of a sudden?

163
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,170
I want to swear.

164
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,200
5 cents.

165
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:25,080
Shall we go clubbing? It's been a while.

166
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,500
I'll just close down shop today for you. Let's go.

167
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,280
- Really? 
 - Yeah, let's go.

168
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,850
Then, can I go somewhere else instead?

169
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:38,050
Where, where?

170
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:43,520
♫  I think of your sad expression  ♫

171
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,230
♫  I look down, tears stream down my face  ♫

172
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:52,470
♫  I can't say anything, but   ♫

173
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:56,670
♫  I love you! My world is only you!   ♫
 Be quiet!

174
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,120
♫  I scream and call out for you,  ♫

175
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:05,600
♫  But the only response I get is the bright sunset  ♫

176
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:27,050
Don't go in too deep! That's enough!

177
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,730
You know what, do as you please! You love the ocean.

178
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:23,300
 What have you hidden inside your heart?

179
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,500
 The ocean.

180
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,780
 Now, we will make a decision

181
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,630
 regarding Case 578 of 2020.

182
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,040
 Police impersonation is defined

183
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,240
 as an act of false portrayal in order to deceive.

184
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,470
 In the case of defendant Cha Dong Il,

185
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:59,540
there is a lack of evidence indicating he had intentions of deceit.

186
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,560
Furthermore, assessment of the defendant's mental state

187
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,000
shows that his perception of reality is distorted,

188
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,180
suggesting that the defendant has a delusional disorder.

189
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:13,470
Thus, the charges associated with impersonation of a government official

190
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,350
are dismissed.

191
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:30,270
I know I'm not police,

192
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:34,110
but I keep getting confused like an idiot.

193
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:37,390
Next time, let's put on a real badge instead of a fake one.

194
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,500
Here. The next test is in three months.

195
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,770

196
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,820
It was for a very brief moment,

197
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,190
but imagine that you were a hero in a movie.

198
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,210
Protecting the world and saving others from danger.

199
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:06,570
After you completed all your missions, you have returned as a normal human.

200
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,830
Do you think I can do it?

201
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,840
Rule number 1 of a superhero movie:

202
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,740
A hero always returns stronger than he was before.

203
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,110
Rule number 2:

204
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:22,950
Your worst enemy is yourself.

205
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,610
Don't even think of quitting.

206
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,150
I'll be going now.

207
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,500
Good work.

208
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,180
I thought Si Joon would be more stubborn,

209
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,110
but he's really transferring patient Cha.

210
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,900
He's someone that keeps his promises.

211
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,170
 I won't be admitted.

212
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,750
 I won't be going there.

213
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,370
 My reason?

214
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,440
 I can overcome this on my own.

215
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,850
Hey, Lee Si Joon, you knew about this, didn't you?

216
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:16,720
What?

217
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,590
That Cha Dong Il will not be admitted.

218
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,390
What are you saying? He left for the other hospital.

219
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:24,420
He called his new doctor from the road and said that he won't be going and got out of the car.

220
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,670
You really didn't know? You didn't tell him to do this?

221
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,380
I really didn't.

222
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,190
He decided that on his own.

223
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,420
You have to be honest with me, at least. If you are involved again, this time...

224
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,050
I really didn't know, I'm telling you the truth.

225
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,900
You can smile right now?

226
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,690
Yeah, I'm proud of him, aren't you?

227
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,920
Cha Dong Il, nice!

228
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:05,160
♫  In that dawn  ♫

229
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:15,320
♫  At the end of that long journey, we have  ♫

230
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,180

♫  Become abandoned  ♫

231
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,750
Why did you ask to see me?

232
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:40,730
To give you my apology. I am very sorry I wasn't able to keep our engagement last time.

233
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:46,400
Anything I tell you will become excuses, so I won't bother to explain.

234
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,800
Oh, and Cha Dong Il's case was dismissed by the court, and he was able to leave the hospital due to your help.

235
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,150
Do you have anything else left to say?

236
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,600
- Do you like soccer?
 - I hate it.

237
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,790
Then, do you know soccer player Oh Yoo Min? He's on the national team.

238
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:09,900
He's practicing hard for his comeback now.

239
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,720
- Want to go cheer him on together?
 - Why should I?

240
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,670
It turns out Oh Yoo Min is your fan, Ms. Woo Joo.

241
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,990
How would he know me?

242
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:21,640
He liked you since a long time ago. He knows all the projects you've been in.

243
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,450
- Is that true?
 - Of course.

244
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:26,140
You can ask him yourself when you meet him.

245
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,700
He's over there.

246
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,610
- What's his number?
 - Number 8.

247
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,670
There he is!

248
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:51,490
Wow sure enough, he is bursting with energy.

249
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,900
Oh Yoo Min, fighting! Fighting!

250
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,160
Looking good! Oh yeah!

251
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:04,500
Run, run, run!

252
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,390
Looking good!

253
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:16,460
Oh Yoo Min, take it easy, hold back a little, it's just practice. Don't discourage the other players.

254
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:31,070
Bring it up! Bring it up!

255
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:39,660
Yeah! Did you see that?

256
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,850
You're still alive, Oh Yoo Min!

257
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:46,330
Oh Yoo Min! Oh Yoo Min! Oh Yoo Min!

258
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,600
Yes, indeed!

259
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,580
Oh!

260
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,460
- Are you alright?
 - Oh, take it easy, please. It's just practice.

261
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,180
Oh Yoo Min, are you alright?

262
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,790
- Why did they push him?
 - Indeed, you look cool.

263
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,120
Golden Left Foot, Oh Yoo Min!

264
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,780
Golden Left Foot, Oh Yoo Min!

265
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,180
- Golden Left Foot, Oh Yoo Min!
 - Golden Left Foot, Oh Yoo Min!

266
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,450
- Golden Left Foot, Oh Yoo Min!
 - Golden Left Foot, Oh Yoo Min!

267
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:56,100
- Golden Left Foot, Oh Yoo Min!
 - Golden Left Foot, Oh Yoo Min!

268
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,490
 - Golden Left Foot, Oh Yoo Min!
 - Golden Left Foot, Oh Yoo Min!

269
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,910
 - Golden Left Foot, Oh Yoo Min!
 - Golden Left Foot, Oh Yoo Min!

270
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:13,900
 - Golden Left Foot, Oh Yoo Min!
 - Golden Left Foot, Oh Yoo Min!

271
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,450
Wow, he did it! It went in!

272
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:27,490
Oh Yoo Min! Oh Yoo Min! Oh Yoo Min!

273
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,860
Oh Yoo Min! Oh Yoo Min!

274
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:35,000
Oh Yoo Min! Oh Yoo Min! Oh Yoo Min! Oh Yoo Min!

275
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,860
Oh, my throat. I shouted so much.

276
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:45,730
It was a lie, wasn't it? That Athlete Oh was my fan?

277
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,800
Did I really say that?

278
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,570
Here it is. Thanks for seeing me home.

279
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,110
Then, bye.

280
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:05,870
Oh, right. I think you are a good doctor.

281
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,550
You see well.

282
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:15,440
Then, how about getting treatment from a good doctor?

283
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:21,690
What are you saying?

284
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:26,290
Ms. Woo Joo, I want to help you.

285
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,950
So are you treating me as a crazy woman right now?

286
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,930
No, it's not like that.

287
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,950
I am a crazy woman, actually.

288
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:42,270
So you're right about that, but are you confident?

289
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,300
Confident that you can treat me?

290
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,120
Ms. Woo Joo, you are not crazy. You are ill.

291
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:59,860
Ms. Woo Joo, if you would only acknowledge that you are ill,

292
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,800
I can treat you for sure.

293
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:14,250
♫  If I just smile as if everything is fine, will it get better?  ♫

294
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:20,100

295
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:24,010
 Anger, please disappear. Anger, please disappear.

296
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,840
 He swallowed this entire thing, why did he do that?

297
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,850
 Do you eat paper often?

298
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:32,290
 - What is that?
 - A gift. Open it after you get home.

299
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,130
 Why are you doing this to me?

300
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:37,950
 You canceled your appointment with me, so I thought you were very busy and I would visit you.

301
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,290
 The delusions and hallucinations are becoming more severe.

302
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,980
 You see, I...

303
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:48,940
 To treat anorexia, I think Lee Si Joon's methods are correct.

304
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,480
 - What are you doing? 
- I'll be working part-time at the hospital.

305
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,020
 - What kind of work at the hospital?
 - Aren't you her? The musical actress?

306
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:59,200
 After suffering that disgrace...

307
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,480
 You have to fix that temper of yours. Think of all the times you've ruined things because of your anger.

308
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:09,360
 There is no disorder without a source. There is a reason that you've become a fighting hawk.
