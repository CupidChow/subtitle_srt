1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,590

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,000
Oh my, you scared me.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,620
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,340
Did you come to see me?

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,470
- Well, technically not that but... 
- Ah...

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,120
Because you were worried?

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,980
I'm not worried. Why would I be worried? You didn't do anything wrong.

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,080
Well, you could worry a little.

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,780
You see, that thing called worry,

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:35,120
the more you worry, the more it piles up. So it's better to not do it in the first place.

11
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:43,750
On a day like today, if you consider this and that, I thought you might find things complicating.

12
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,070
I felt you might need this.

13
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,640
If there's someone you want to curse at, do it here instead of holding it in.

14
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,020
Well then, I'm off to collect my watch.

15
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,370
- Strike two. 
- Excuse me?

16
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:35,700
After I become the Hospital's Director, there is something I decided.

17
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,840
Whatever situation arises, let it go three times.

18
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,180
Whatever the wrong, forgive it three times max.

19
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:51,030
Because a Hospital Director should be a little generous and use benevolent speech.

20
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,600
However, Doctor Lee, you have two strikes. What do you want to do?

21
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,250
I'm sorry about the foregoing investigation. I will take responsibility for it.

22
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,660
Responsibility? Are you going to take off your doctor's coat?

23
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,080
No, not that.

24
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,760
Then are you going to use the 'Chief Park card' this time also?

25
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,480
It has no connection with Chief Park.

26
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,090
Then what does it have to do with me?

27
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,420
Thanks to you, the person who has to be investigated is me as the Hospital's Director.

28
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,360
You?

29
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,160
Look at this. I see you have zero knowledge of the law.

30
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,000
But like I said earlier, I will let it go up till this point.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,380
Because I'm the Hospital Director.

32
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,510
But the next time is strike three. You know very well what happens then without me saying it, don't you?

33
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,120
I was also reported when I opened the hospital.

34
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,060
By whom?

35
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,040
The neighbors sued me. Saying that the hospital made them anxious and made the neighborhood  ambience gloomy.

36
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,160
Talking nonsense about psychiatric clinics being bad for the public health or something...

37
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,130
That darned punk. I still get mad thinking about that.

38
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:13,040
Hey, she must have been so angered.

39
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,820
I sued him right back and made him crawl out of there.

40
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,690
You did well.

41
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,830
Si Joon, you look depressed today. Are you alright?

42
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:34,680
Well, it doesn't matter what happens to me but I never thought that the Hospital's Director would be investigated.

43
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,790
That's because all legal problems are her responsibility.

44
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:44,260
Regardless, if you could return to that time, you would still make the same choice. Wouldn't you?

45
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,080
How is Han Woo Joo these days?

46
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,740
She finally admitted that she's a patient.

47
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,560
Oh that's a huge development.

48
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,930
We're in the process of psychoanalysis.

49
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,310
Are the results out?

50
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:04,300
Not yet. But it's definitely not just an Intermittent Explosive Disorder.

51
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,100
- Then? 
- Impulsive human relationships,

52
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,720
anger, unpredictability, mood disorder.

53
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,680
What has these characteristics?

54
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,620
There is one thing comes to mind.

55
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,360
What is that?

56
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,620
No way. It can't be.

57
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,300
There's no way you would've introduced me to a patient with borderline personality disorder. Right?

58
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,550
What happens if by chance, she has borderline personality disorder?

59
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,830
- It's been a while but these green-onion pancakes are really good. 
- Why are you avoiding it?

60
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,490
-  What? 
- Why would a person who ignored all administrative procedures and forcefully admitted Park Ru Oh, avoid this topic?

61
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,310
Stop it, Dong Hyuk.

62
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,990
Okay. Let's leave it.

63
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,010
How could you be so fine?

64
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,000
About what?

65
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,430
You put a star up in the sky last year.

66
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:34,570
You call yourself a doctor, but how can you be so fine when something like that happened to your patient?

67
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,970
- This punk really— 
 - Me?

68
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,540
Because of a star I put up in the sky 8 years ago,

69
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:44,830
I can't go to sleep unless I run around like crazy giving it my all during the day.

70
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,590
I just can't fathom how  you could be so fine, that's all.

71
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,900
This jerk really—!

72
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,520
Please stop.

73
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,650
Don't make a mockery of me, you punk.

74
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,970
Just because the wounds are  healed doesn't mean I'm fine.

75
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,130
Is it something to brag about, that he can't forget what happened 8 years ago?

76
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:34,240
Dong Hyuk, I must have made a mistake. I shouldn't have introduced Han Woo Joo to him.

77
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,770
I had no idea he had this hard a time forgetting about it.

78
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,340
Hey, Ji Young Won.

79
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,490
- Why are you always worrying about only Si Joon? 
- What?

80
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,300
Isn't it time for you to stop?

81
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,310
Who is the informant?

82
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,950
He said no one comes to mind.

83
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:21,320
So even psychiatrists can be put in situations like this... Ji Soo needs to be careful.

84
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,410
By the way... he told me to go get my watch back from Hwang Min Wook, but what should I do?

85
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:29,940
What do you mean? You should do as you were told.

86
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,410
Do you think I really need to show that person the rock bottom of my pettiness?

87
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:38,750
Hello? You already showed it. You said you called asking for it.

88
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:44,800
Gosh... why do I hit rock bottom so often?

89
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,590
I'm sorry but we're clos—

90
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,570
I'm sure you didn't come to eat. Did you come to see me?

91
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:08,570
I didn't come to eat nor did I come to see you.

92
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:18,160
I came to give this to you. You said you were coming yesterday but since you didn't...

93
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,850
I was coming to get it anyway. Thank you.

94
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,140
Hey, why are you thanking him?

95
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,760
You have nothing else to take from me, right? If there is, say it now.

96
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,010
I don't know, what else could there be?

97
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,680
The one year I  lost?

98
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:43,920
I do have something. The bills for food. You ate a lot of free food at my house.

99
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,740
- Get that from her. 
- What?

100
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,240
The money to fix my car,

101
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,350
do you know how much it amounted to? Couldn't we break up a little more beautifully?

102
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:58,100
Hey! The moment you cheated, that beauty was already destroyed.

103
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,150
This is outrageous. This is exactly what they call gaslighting!

104
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:06,300
It's not the first time your breakup was caused by your boyfriend cheating on you.

105
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,400
When the same thing keeps repeating itself, there's a reason why.

106
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,590
I was a coward, but there is a problem in your life.

107
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:30,940
Look at him pretending to be so powerful! Oh my!

108
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,050
Hey, what's with you again?

109
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:43,470
He's right, though. The guys I dated before also cheated on me, that's why we broke up.

110
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,770
Don't cry. Don't waste your tears.

111
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,530
I'm not crying.

112
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:00,040
I'm a crazy bastard. What am I doing here, at this time?

113
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,020
Do I have nowhere else to go? Pathetic.

114
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,450
Woo Joo, what are you doing here?

115
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,400
I didn't know what to do with this.

116
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,150
That's right.

117
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:45,130
You told me to call but why didn't you answer? I called you many times.

118
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,460
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

119
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:53,610
I felt like if I took this home, I would stay up all night staring at it.

120
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,830
I was going to throw it in the trash but I felt that wasn't right.

121
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,150
- Do you want to bury it, scatter it, or cremate it? 
- Huh?

122
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:07,770
Throwing it in the water would be bad for the environment, and it also wouldn't burn properly.

123
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,130
I'd like to bury it.

124
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,820
Let's do that.

125
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,250
You could consider this a ritual.

126
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,060
That's right.

127
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,640
Alright, throw it now.

128
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,530
While we're at it, throw it to the very top with all your strength.

129
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,610
You throw very well.

130
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,770
Are you a shot put athlete?

131
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:01,080
 It felt refreshing, though it wasn't much.

132
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,670
- I did well, right? 
- Nice.

133
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,910
Nice!

134
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:09,950
  All I did was throw  one of my old memories in a garbage dump,

135
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:15,720
  but it felt like my wounds were also buried in the garbage dump.

136
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:24,650
Three months ago, Ru Oh sent me an S.O.S. through my podcast.

137
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:29,140
I was doing a live broadcast that day, but he said he heard hallucinations

138
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,520
that kept telling him to jump in front of a car.

139
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,970
I had no choice but to admit him.

140
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:39,040
We couldn't get in contact with his guardian for a couple days.

141
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,260
We eventually did, but he said he was in Vietnam and couldn't come immediately.

142
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,990
I couldn't send the kid back to the little study dorm  he was living in alone,

143
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:52,870
so I admitted him and I guess that turned out to be forceful hospitalization.

144
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,300
And that's how the investigation came about.

145
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,210
Why is that forceful hospitalization?

146
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:00,050
How could you have just sent him back to such a dangerous place?

147
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:03,740
He can only be without a guardian for a maximum of three days.

148
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,570
I knew it would become a problem one day.

149
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,070
So what do you do now?

150
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:14,560
You said the more you worry, the more it piles up.

151
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,660
I'm not worried.

152
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,730
Go in.

153
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,330
Goodnight.

154
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,560
Shall we do some exercises?

155
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,970
You prescribed them to me last time. They were really effective.

156
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,180
The moon is so beautiful today too.

157
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,930
Let's do it.

158
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,870
What are you doing? Why are you doing it  roughly?

159
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:53,440
Even if it's just one move, you should do it precisely  and  with discipline.

160
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,860
- Try it.  
- Alright, waist exercise. Here we go.

161
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:01,790
1,2,3,4. 2,2,3,4.

162
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:06,060
3,2,3,4. 4,2,3,4.

163
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,050
Alright, shoulder exercise.

164
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:12,080
2,3,4. 2,2,3,4.

165
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,600
3,2,3,4.

166
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,110
Okay, cross your fingers and reach above your head.

167
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,990
1,2,3,4.

168
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:26,710
All the way.

169
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,080
- Refreshing, right? 
- Yes.

170
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,110
Shaking the body. Let's go!

171
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,110
Okay, shake your body!

172
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,570
As if your arms are not your arms! Not yours!

173
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,810
- Shake them! 
 - What kind of exercise is this?

174
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,250
Shake your body!

175
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,000

176
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,540

177
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:56,550
I knew you would cause trouble one day.

178
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,760
The legal team will contact you, so wait for that.

179
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,280
The Gwangsu regional police office conducted the investigation.

180
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,750
They said they couldn't find any evidence of physical violence in the CCTV footage.

181
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,370
It seems they only found out about you ignoring all the procedures and forceful hospitalization.

182
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,020
I'm sorry.

183
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,340
You knew everything and did it regardless, didn't you?

184
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,910
There was nothing else I could do.

185
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,190
You will be investigated at the police station soon.

186
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:33,080
The Hospital's Director is also being investigated, right?

187
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,010
Of course.

188
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,850
Why are you so headstrong?

189
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,010
I don't regret it.

190
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:48,940
If I had just sent Ru Oh back, he could have died.

191
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:53,150
Transfer Park Ru Oh to Dong Hyuk.

192
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,300
He is my patient.

193
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,010
Should we just send him to a completely different hospital?

194
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,840
Alright.

195
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,720
You ignored all the procedures.

196
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,060
Exactly why are you this obsessed with your patients?

197
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,670
You know, don't you, why you are being this way?

198
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:16,910
- Obviously— 
- Don't give me the obvious answer like  you were thinking about the patient.

199
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,630
You know that there is another reason.

200
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:29,340
- Start consultation with me. 
- Chief.

201
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:35,310
Also, keep in mind that for the time being, you will have no outpatient care.

202
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,370
Why?

203
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:40,750
Consider it a relief that this is how the incident is ending!

204
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,330
Why aren't you leaving?

205
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,430

206
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:02,710

207
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:09,060
  They took away my patients from me.

208
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,820
  They're my reason for living, though.

209
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,660
Doctor.

210
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,080
What are you doing here?

211
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,070
It's going to be a while before the theatrical therapy starts, though.

212
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,140
I was just looking for some quiet.

213
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,600
You don't have any appointments today?

214
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,660
Oh, perhaps are you slacking off?

215
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,940
Do you want to drink this? I just bought it.

216
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,750
It's fine.

217
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,060
Did something bad happen?

218
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,730
I definitely told you yesterday

219
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:12,290
that  the more you worry, the more it piles up.

220
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,920
Tell me, I'll listen to you.

221
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,330
There's nothing to say.

222
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,960

223
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,100
What was that?

224
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,400
Why is he being that way all of a sudden?

225
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,310
Today is my daughter's birthday.

226
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:52,140
Because she has a mother like me, she can't even eat a bowl of seaweed soup on her birthday.

227
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,170
She's doing part-time jobs to earn money.

228
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:59,060
Still, you can't go out according to the rules.

229
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,720
You know the convenience store in front of the hospital, right?

230
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,570
She works part-time there.

231
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,450
I'll call her for you.

232
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:11,380
I said it's her birthday.

233
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:16,130
Don't you know what a surprise is?

234
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,820
You can't.

235
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,320
You have exactly 10 minutes.

236
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,970
I said I got it.

237
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,090
Welcome.

238
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,640
Hello.

239
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,240
What are you doing?

240
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,530
- Give it back.  
- I can't.

241
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,560
- I said give it. 
- I said no!

242
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,110
- I said give it to me!  
- I said I can't.

243
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,070
What are you doing right now?

244
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,290
Give it to me!

245
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,860
No!

246
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,030
What are you guys doing?

247
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,820
What are you doing? You should stop your mom!

248
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,430
What? I'm not her daughter.

249
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:13,900
- What? 
- Give it to me. I said give it to me!

250
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,110
Give it to me!

251
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,380
Oh no, what do I do?

252
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,360
Yoon Ji!

253
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,760
Doctor...

254
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,390
Doctor...

255
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,390
If a patient has let go of their sanity and is drinking alcohol,

256
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:13,820
you should do everything in your power to stop it, but you sit there crying.

257
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,290
You're a doctor.

258
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,610
I'm sorry.

259
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:25,200
Here in psychiatry, just because you do something with a good heart doesn't mean it will yield good results.

260
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,980
I got it.

261
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,730
Yes, Chief.

262
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:38,220
Yes, alright.

263
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,690
You should treat Park Ru Oh from now on.

264
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,380
Si Joon agreed.

265
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:10,910
Chief, is there any reason to take Si Joon's patients from him?

266
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:16,040
I'm not taking patients from Si Joon. You're the only eligible doctor.

267
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,360
I understand.

268
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,790
It's going to be hard for Si Joon, so you should help him a bit.

269
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,720
Of course, I should.

270
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,160
Alright. You may leave.

271
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,140
But Chief, who is the informant?

272
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,190
You know, don't you?

273
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,350
I don't know either.

274
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:44,730
People call me a wild rabbit. They say I'm  a rabbit because I'm always going for walks.

275
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,550
They must be mistaken.

276
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:50,270
Wild rabbits are fast but you're slow.

277
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:53,620
That's why you always get caught by me.

278
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,760
Ru Oh,

279
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:04,020
from now on, your doctor will change.

280
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,970
Why?

281
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,280
You're upset, aren't you?

282
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:16,580
I understand. You're taken aback and sad.

283
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,380
I'm fine.

284
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,200
Really?

285
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,930
I'm about to be upset.

286
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,870
I heard from the nurse in the ward

287
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,650
that the police were here because of me.

288
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:32,120
Who said such absurd rumors? That's not it.

289
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,580
I'm alright.

290
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:48,570
Park Ru Oh, I told you to say it hurts if  you're hurt, didn't I?

291
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,580
Have you forgotten why you became ill?

292
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,350
Because I was scared but didn't say I was.

293
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:03,400
Because I felt lonely but didn't say that I felt that way.

294
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,080
So why are you holding it in?

295
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,400
I won't hold it in.

296
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:46,390
I documented his condition from the first day he was admitted up until yesterday, so refer to it.

297
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:07,140
  In Dong Hyuk

298
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,680
Lee Si Joon has gone crazy.

299
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,600
He's the craziest doctor I've ever seen.

300
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,350

301
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,390
Are you really going to be this way?

302
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,430
- What are you talking about? 
- Are you asking because you don't know?

303
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,420
Why have you been like this since earlier?

304
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:58,100
Did I do something wrong? Did I make a mistake?

305
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,540
You didn't do anything wrong nor did you make any mistake.

306
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:06,940
I've just got a lot on my mind, that's why. Let's talk later.

307
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:21,640

308
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,280
 Why did I cut my wrists?

309
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,000
  Because I want to receive attention.

310
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:47,760
 When I was younger, I wanted to receive attention from my adopted parents, so I started a fire.

311
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:54,840
 Of course, it resulted in my adoption being dissolved. However, I never felt like dying.

312
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,750
 I just wished they would look at me.

313
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:08,530

314
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,000
♫  Goodbye  ♫

315
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,170

♫  The memories I want to forget   ♫

316
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,770
 Why did you send Han Woo Joo to me? You knew from the beginning and sent her, didn't you?

317
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:21,760
 Do you really know who the informant is?

318
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,900
 The culprit is—

319
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,710
 Why did you needlessly interfere?

320
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,440
 I'm going to quit the theatrical therapy.

321
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,930
 How could someone who harms the patients do theatrical therapy?

322
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:32,230
 What is with me seriously?

323
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,610
 Doctor Si Joon!

324
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,570
 Ru Oh has been in an accident.

325
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:37,610
 What the—

326
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:41,160
 I can't believe our country's best cardiac surgeon is a criminal who plants hidden cameras.

327
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:45,120
 How great would it be if I could turn back time just one day?

328
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,400
