1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,240
Since it's a company gathering, let me try making something special.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,360
Oh, Dr. Noh.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,220
I don't have the ingredients to make something special right now.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,420
We don't need anything special.

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:18,180
The food at Kong Rice House is so good, you could just sprinkle salt on the rice and it would be delicious.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,180
Alright, yes.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,790
I'll make something then, see you later.

8
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,890
Oh, you scared me.

9
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,020
What's with you? Make some noise when you walk.

10
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:37,260
Who could you be speaking with that our Ji Sun's face would bloom with smiles?

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,710
- I didn't do that.
 - This is quite suspicious.

12
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,980
When did you get here? I didn't expect you.

13
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,490
Hey, I'm really sorry.

14
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,460
If I ever do that again, then fire me.

15
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,690
Fire you. How can I fire you?

16
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,720
You even quit your job at the hospital.

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,930
Our Woo Joo, your face is the one blooming.

18
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,200
Is it so obvious?

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,760
Ugh. Let go.

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,670
I have to cook.

21
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,960
Let me ask this directly.

22
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,170
Who did this?

23
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,860
Don't misunderstand.

24
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,190
I'm not trying to single out and punish someone.

25
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,720
I'm trying to protect you, from the hospital's perspective.

26
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,040
The survivors are having fits, trying to find a perpetrator so they can sue.

27
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,220
I'm sure it's difficult to say right now who is the one.

28
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,020
So please come to see me at any time to tell me.

29
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,280
Everyone understand?

30
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:54,610
Oh right, who is the nurse who told Nurse Heo to walk barefoot because her shoes were noisy?

31
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,780
Nurse Na, was that you?

32
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:00,130
She was always dragging her shoes, so the patient had trouble sleeping.

33
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,720
I understand.

34
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,840
Whoever has something to say to me, please come to see me.

35
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,550
Why are you all doing this to only me?

36
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,420
What are you saying that we did?

37
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,500
Nurse Jeong, let's go.

38
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:58,560
Nurse Heo of ICU, she was your colleague, wasn't she, Nurse Jeong?

39
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,100
Doctor, I feel so sorry I want to die.

40
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,120
Min Yeong came to see me two days before she died.

41
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,770
She seemed so uneasy, but I just let her go.

42
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,430
No matter how close you were to someone,

43
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:26,360
your memory of them disappears faster than you expect after they die.

44
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,480
It's rather sad.

45
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,580
So, rather than blame yourself, try to remember the good times.

46
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,750
You have plenty of time to blame yourself later.

47
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:49,350
But since when did Nurse Heo start having a hard time?

48
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,860
Since she was new.

49
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,170
What are you doing? Can't even do a proper intravenous injection?

50
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,020
Sorry.

51
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,090
Move.

52
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,380
Look at those bruises. Can you do this to someone just because they can't talk right now?

53
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,960
Apologize to the patient right now.

54
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,220
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,730
On your knees. Apologize to him on your knees.

56
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,070
You won't do it?

57
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,710
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,390
Min Yeong said

59
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:53,450
that every day on her commute, she wished to be hit by a car.

60
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:59,640
That she hoped to be hospitalized for a few days due to the accident. That it was her only wish.

61
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,970
How long did you know Heo Min Yeong?

62
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,440
It's been a year.

63
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,910
Seeing your text messages, she sent you a lot of messages with resentment against you.

64
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:22,220
- Did you fight with her?
 - No, we never fought.

65
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,810
So why would she send you messages like that?

66
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:29,500
It's a common occurrence that can happen between a patient and his psychiatrist.

67
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:36,380
Her survivors are preparing to sue based on her suicide note.

68
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,010
What?

69
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,800
If you two had no problems with each other,

70
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,070
why would she write about you even in her suicide note?

71
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,810
Her body had a lot of bruises.

72
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,430
Do you know anything about that?

73
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,120
No, I do not.

74
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,880
I understand.

75
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,360
Since this is witness testimony, we will contact you again if we need to.

76
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,720
He's asking for a chorus, why hesitate?

77
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,180
Just do it. You definitely should.

78
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,940
Of course, I want to.

79
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,350
But practicing with the patients, it's no ordinary task.

80
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,550
Shall I help?

81
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,520
Really?

82
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,600
If you help me, I could do it.

83
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,380
Of course, I will help.

84
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,430
Can you play the cello, too?

85
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:31,000
Hey, I could even play the piano for you, too.

86
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,260
Whoa.

87
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,710
But I haven't even looked at my cello for a long time. I better practice.

88
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:44,910
Ji Sun, do you regret giving up music?

89
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:49,500
Well, rather than regret, I do feel a little wistful.

90
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,970
The cello kind of feels like a lover I broke up with a long time ago.

91
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:02,190
I will make sure you play cello on a stage.

92
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,810
Maybe you get back on stage first before making such promises?

93
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,290
- Sounds good?
 - Yeah.

94
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,040
I understand.

95
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,930
Kong Rice House

96
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,330
- Here it is.
 - Thank you.

97
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:21,760
And this is exclusively for Cha Dong Il,

98
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,980
special service.

99
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,770
Thank you.

100
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,890
I sincerely congratulate you on becoming a police officer.

101
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,460
Thank you.

102
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,860
Woo Joo, why don't you sit and join us?

103
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,600
Yes, please join us. We didn't even get to throw you a farewell party.

104
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,000
What do you mean, farewell party? I'm not going anywhere,

105
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,360
so if you ever miss me, just come here at any time.

106
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,910
- Officer Cha.
 - Yes.

107
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:56,920
Do you know this, Officer Cha? You've become a role model for other patients.

108
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,670
Yes, I did expect that you will all become surprised when you saw me.

109
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:05,990
Man, stop acting so pleased with yourself. You're still a trainee.

110
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,280
I hope you get assigned to a police station near us.

111
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,570
Wherever I go, I will make sure to protect you, doctors.

112
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:21,160
If you are scared of walking at night, or you need help, call me at any time.

113
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,990
Shall we all have a drink together?

114
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,000
Sounds good.

115
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,560
Congratulations.

116
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,520
- Nice mood, huh?
 - Yeah.

117
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,080
Officer Cha, I'm curious about something.

118
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,220
What is going on with Nurse Heo's case? Some people are saying it's not suicide?

119
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,420
Nurse Heo has been depressed for a while now, and they even found the suicide note.

120
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:46,290
It is suicide. People are making up stories for no reason.

121
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:51,030
I cannot tell you details about the investigation.

122
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,700
But when will Dr. Ji Young Won be investigated? You can tell us that.

123
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:59,100
She was investigated already. I came here right after we spoke to her.

124
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,420
Doctor, hold on. Let me go with you.

125
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,630
Woo Joo, stay here. I'll contact you later.

126
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,400
But I'm worried about Dr. Young Won, too.

127
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,420
Young Won never shows her pain no matter how much she hurts.

128
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:22,260
She'll work harder to hide it if she sees you.

129
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,160
I understand.

130
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,690
See you.

131
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,850
Bring my daughter back to life.

132
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,470
Please don't do that.

133
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,710
Please calm down. Please calm down.

134
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,910
Are you alright?

135
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,310
Mother,

136
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:53,180
I am Psychiatrist Lee Si Joon, I work at the same hospital as Nurse Heo did.

137
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,700
Did you know my daughter?

138
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,450
We've never worked together.

139
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,310
But I did hear about her from a nurse who worked with her.

140
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,940
My Min Yeong,

141
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,500
why did she die?

142
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,310
We intend to find out the reason together.

143
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,390
But you know!

144
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:21,110
You know! Min Yeong wrote it in her suicide note!

145
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:24,120
That she told you everything

146
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,070
and she listened to everything you told her.

147
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,560
I'm sorry.

148
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,960
But why couldn't you stop her?

149
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,420
I was her mom, and I didn't know,

150
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,410
but you should have known.

151
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,670
You should have known and stopped her.

152
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,430
I didn't know!

153
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,800
Nurse Heo had come one day after getting hit by one of her senior nurses.

154
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,710
She even had bruises on her arm from getting pinched.

155
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:16,570
The moment I saw that, I couldn't control my emotions.

156
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,610
You endured until things got this bad?

157
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,950
Then what do I do? I did make a mistake.

158
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:33,340
This is violence. Why do you just endure after suffering this kind of treatment?

159
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,560
If you can't fight on your own, you have to ask for help.

160
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,730
If you do nothing, this will continue.

161
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,010
I'm so angry.

162
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,440
Let's go out.

163
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,940
- To where?
 - You said you liked to sing.

164
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,320
Let's go to a noraebang, and eat something yummy, too.

165
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,230
Can you do that?

166
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,510
I want to go just for myself too. Or else I'll get sick from anger.

167
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,440
Thank you, Doctor.

168
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,510
Then where shall we begin?

169
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,350
But she stopped coming after that.

170
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,810
And you don't know what happened?

171
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:18,160
She fought back like I advised her, but things got even worse for her, she said.

172
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,930
So she began to text me about how resentful she was. And she never answered when I called.

173
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,990
I just assumed that that's how things are, as she is a patient.

174
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,060
That she would return one day, and I just waited.

175
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:36,880
Two weeks ago, she told me a patient died because of her.

176
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,230
I guess that was the pivotal moment for her.

177
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,760
Si Joon, was I too emotional in my response to her?

178
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,350
Should I have told her to endure it to the end?

179
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,530
I think I would have done the same as you.

180
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:57,330
As a doctor, you've done your best.

181
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,600
Let's go out and have a drink. Invite Dong Hyuk, too.

182
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,100
I want to be alone.

183
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,370
You cannot be alone right now.

184
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,810
I want to sleep, that's why.

185
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,370
Then let's leave here together. That's okay, right?

186
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,140
Don't think about anything and just sleep.

187
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,740
And call me if anything happens.

188
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,390
Why do you smile?

189
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,510
I can't get used to you worrying so much about me, that's why.

190
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,990
You're making me feel sorry.

191
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,170
Be careful on your way home.

192
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,840
Let's meet now, it's about Young Won.

193
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,160
Dr. Noh, you don't have to clean, too.

194
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,300
No, how can you finish all this on your own?

195
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,520
I will sweep, so you go in the kitchen and tidy up.

196
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,770
No, no, no.

197
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,550
- What is it?
 - Why are you so nice to me?

198
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:51,570
This isn't much, though.

199
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,850
I can be even nicer than this.

200
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,150
What the--

201
00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:01,370
If you're grateful, pay me back. Play the cello for me sometime.

202
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,520
A civil suit? Is that possible?

203
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,020
You can always sue someone.

204
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,330
How is Young Won?

205
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,900
She said she wanted to go home early to sleep.

206
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:20,220
The arrow landed on the wrong target. What do we do about this?

207
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,130
Her survivors need someone to focus their resentment on.

208
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,130
I think the hospital must step forward and take full responsibility.

209
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,690
I agree with that.

210
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,220
The Vice President is looking for a perpetrator right now.

211
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,870
The hospital is making a big effort to not take any responsibility at all.

212
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:40,180
But is there any one perpetrator? What is there to find?

213
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:46,110
Let me try to speak to the Director myself and persuade her.

214
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,550
I think Chief will be more effective than you.

215
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,330
Yes, I will meet with her.

216
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:53,070
The Director will not agree to see you.

217
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,180
Well, I'm already on her bad side. But not you.

218
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:00,340
I already had it out with her this afternoon about this issue.

219
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:04,120
I will meet with the surviving family members and try to persuade them.

220
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,860
Wow, this is the first time in a long time that we all agree on something.

221
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:17,790
In any case, because the hospital's image is on the line, they won't easily agree to take responsibility.

222
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:22,010
Let me try to think of a way to persuade the Director.

223
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,800
Alright, let's give it a try.

224
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,810
Ok.

225
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:29,200
Chief, I will take my leave now.

226
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,770
- Did he get a call?
 - Probably not.

227
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:46,210
After hearing what happened to Nurse Heo, do you know what I worried about?

228
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,140
Did you worry about me, by any chance?

229
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,170
So you know.

230
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,530
Chief,

231
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:05,500
if I dated Han Woo Joo but told you I am not, would that make you feel better?

232
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,780
I've become much better. You don't have to worry about me anymore.

233
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,580
Oh, right. Did you hear about Cha Dong Il?

234
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:22,030
Yes, I heard he became a real policeman.

235
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,970
I can't believe it even after seeing it.

236
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:29,680
But thanks to Cha Dong Il, I can breathe just a little bit.

237
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,720
Young Won, are you really asleep?

238
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,850
I'll be waiting. Call me at any time.

239
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,890
- Hello.
 - Which unit is that for?

240
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,550
1501, Dr. Ji Young Won.

241
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,990
I left ice cream at the lobby. Take it if you can't sleep.

242
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:59,820
I remembered you always wanted ice cream when you felt stressed out.

243
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:42,670
Hello? Oh, my daughter.

244
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:45,910
Your voice sounds like I woke you from sleeping.

245
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,230
I'm sorry about that.

246
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:53,570
What do you mean? I called because I missed you.

247
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:59,070
I want to go, too.

248
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:07,330
But I have to earn money here and I have so much to do.

249
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:13,250
Of course, this year, I'll make sure to take time off to go see you.

250
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,600
I promise. I mean it.

251
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,190
Alright, get ready for school.

252
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:30,450
You don't have to study too hard.

253
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,750
Eat well and be healthy.

254
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,690
Be at ease and be well.

255
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,840
I love you, too.

256
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,990
It's been a really long time since I came here.

257
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:19,870
You look like you already had a drink?

258
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:24,210
It's a day where I can't bear being lucid.

259
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,790
I'm sorry about this afternoon.

260
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:31,060
But I hope you can understand me a bit?

261
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,100
As a friend, not the hospital director.

262
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,020
That makes it even harder to understand you.

263
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,930
What does that mean?

264
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:42,220
I remember Jo In Hye as a very righteous, just person.

265
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:46,210
You knew about resistance and change.

266
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,070
You're making me feel ashamed.

267
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:52,100
I didn't ask to see you to hear this kind of talk.

268
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:57,140
Don't think about persuading me, just stay out of it.

269
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,080
I'll leave this matter to the Vice President.

270
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,850
I don't want to.

271
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,170
Do you want to fight with me?

272
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:06,620
In Hye, aren't we friends?

273
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,010
Do you know what a friend is?

274
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:11,470
People who share heavy burdens together.

275
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:15,280
This kind of incident never ends with just one.

276
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,000
Sure, maybe we can somehow get past it, once.

277
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,750
But not the second time.

278
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,230
We have to fix it before that happens.

279
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:32,840
I wanted to enjoy a drink with a friend, but...

280
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,560
Woo Joo.

281
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,450
Woo Joo?

282
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:09,580
Oh, you've come?

283
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,530
What are you doing right now, in front of someone's front door?

284
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:16,210
Can't you see it? I was dozing off.

285
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:21,430
Oh, right. I forgot to call you. I'm sorry.

286
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,660
I know.

287
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,840
But I couldn't help it.

288
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:31,340
I missed you so much I couldn't go to my own home.

289
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:35,690
But now I'm fine, I'll go now that I've seen your face.

290
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,730
I'm very tired.

291
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:41,680
Wake up a bit before you go. Don't leave while dozing.

292
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:51,220
This home is quite desirable.

293
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:54,940
It's really nice.

294
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:59,460
My father's touch is all over this house.

295
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,830
You said your father is at a nursing home. What day do you go to visit him?

296
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,780
- Why do you ask?
 - So I can go with you.

297
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,110
Can't I?

298
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,150
What reason would there be that you can't?

299
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:23,360
Dad won't recognize you anyway. So let's go together.

300
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,710
How is Dr. Ji Young Won?

301
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:31,550
She seems to be suffering a lot, but I don't know how to help her.

302
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,930
What could I do to help?

303
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,430
Oh!

304
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,570
It's been a while. When did we meet last?

305
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:02,090
It was when I was new, so I think it's been five years.

306
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,360
Time sure goes by fast.

307
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,830
Mm.

308
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:12,120
If it's about Nurse Heo, I haven't done anything wrong.

309
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,990
Did anyone say that it was because of you, Nurse Na?

310
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:20,690
Vice President came yesterday, and he spoke like it was my fault.

311
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:22,410
It's so unfair to me.

312
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:27,530
I don't think that this incident is due to any one person.

313
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:30,620
It's the fault of the bad system.

314
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:36,200
Nurse Na, I want to prove that.

315
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,090
Can that be proven?

316
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,630
I can do it if you help me.

317
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:44,430
Doctor, why would you do this?

318
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,310
I'm a psychiatrist, that's why.

319
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:50,830
To me, I have the responsibility to try and stop this from happening again.

320
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:58,550
And Nurse Heo was a patient in our psychiatry department.

321
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,390
- What?
 - Nurse Na, you knew, didn't you?

322
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:05,290
What happened to Nurse Heo?

323
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,300
I didn't know she was receiving psychiatric treatment.

324
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:15,980
Suicide is a very bad sickness, it can be contagious.

325
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,460
So Nurse Na, please help me.

326
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:23,240
Just what happened, anyway?

327
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,610
What happened to Officer Cha Dong Il?

328
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,150
- Doctor.
 - Woo Joo?

329
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,020
Inside...

330
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,270
Please...

331
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,580
Hey, please...

332
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,280
Please calm down.

333
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,020
Say what you just said again.

334
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:18,020
Please calm down.

335
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,360
I was wrong, okay?

336
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,620
No, no. What you just said,

337
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,980
say it again!

338
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:28,150
I made a mistake, I'm sorry.

339
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,780
Is that enough?

340
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,690
I said--

341
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:50,310
When I said I was a patient, too.

342
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:53,020
He said that he can't trust what a patient says.

343
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:58,870
And that patients like me have to all be locked up in a hospital.

344
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,820
So... I'm sorry...

345
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,920
Stop talking.

346
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,490
I'm sorry...

347
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,820
I understand what you said.

348
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,390
So you can stop now.

349
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:20,350

350
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:25,630
♫  Would it be better just to smile and pretend I'm ok?  ♫

351
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,830
 Fix You
 Preview

352
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,280
 I want to treat you, Han Woo Joo.

353
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,040
 Me? Why?

354
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,650
 I'm collecting petitions for the nurses.

355
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,080
 Dr. In, you better not get involved.

356
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,650
 I'm worried that this might become a danger to you, Doctor.

357
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,170
 Can I do well?

358
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:45,200
 Honey, why did you come now? I looked for you so much.

359
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,730
 There is something I really wanted to tell Nurse Heo's mother.

360
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:50,640
 The rumor is that she died because of me, that I am the reason she killed herself.

361
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,730
 Nurse Na?

362
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,960
 If one person is sacrificed, the entire hospital can be saved.

363
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:58,160
 Haven't you considered that if things go badly, Nurse Na could make an extreme choice as well?

364
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,230
