1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,500

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,370
I wanted to explain

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,080
what a good doctor Dr. Ji Young Won is.

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,390
But he asked me how I knew that.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,770
As soon as I told him I was her patient, the way he looked at me changed.

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,610
That's horrible.

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:28,210
From there, he didn't even listen to me. He ignored all of it.

8
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,660
So I lost my mind again...

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,970
You should've just waited six seconds.

10
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,110
He said all people who are ill deserve to be put in an asylum!

11
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,900
He said the world would be a better place that way!

12
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,960
Is that something you should say as a joke?

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,820
I tried, too. I tried to hold it in!

14
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,810
I'm sorry. I didn't realize the whole situation.

15
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,760
But... once Young Won finds out that you met the police,

16
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,230
I think she'll be really touched.

17
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:19,370
Oh, instead of that. Why don't you go meet and speak with Dr. Ji directly?

18
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,110
Me? Directly?

19
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:27,380
To a doctor, nothing else gives them more strength than knowing that their patients believe in them.

20
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:43,800

21
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,010
I was wondering if you had suffered any losses?

22
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,200
If so, I can compensate for it.

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,880
Losses? Not at all.

24
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,560
I was more afraid she would hurt herself.

25
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:05,020
But... why did you say those things?

26
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,610
I heard you said all people who are ill deserve to be put into an asylum.

27
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,170
I just said that because there are so many instances of suicide these days.

28
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,950
Do you think those were all sick people?

29
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,020
I think you might be misunderstanding something,

30
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,920
so I'll explain it to you a bit.

31
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,620
Just because a criminal has a mental illness

32
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,590
does not mean the mental illness is the cause of the crime.

33
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,070
That person just committed a crime, with no relation to their mental illness,

34
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,180
just like any other ordinary person.

35
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,710
So you should neither cut a person who committed crime slack because of their mental illness,

36
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,790
nor should you look at them with a different perception because they have a mental illness.

37
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,240
Do you understand?

38
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,920
Yes, well... I understand.

39
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,130
Then fighting for the rest of today!

40
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,230
Thanks. Good work today.

41
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,460
Don't mention it, of course I should've called you.

42
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,090
Head in.

43
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,510
I'll head in now.

44
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,440
 Cha Dong Il, prepare to mobilize.

45
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,940
Yes, I'm on my way.

46
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,730
Bye.

47
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,960
 Nobody in the world wants to die.

48
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,640
 It's not because they want to die,

49
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,160
 but because they want to end their suffering

50
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,840
 that they choose to die.

51
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:03,340
 Where were you? While you were gone, things were crazy around here because this patient's blood pressure rose.

52
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,780
 Were you planning on killing the patient?

53
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,620
 I'm sorry. I really had to use the restroom.

54
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,780
 The restroom?

55
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,270
 Your patient is wearing a diaper and bed-ridden right now.

56
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:17,260
 - Did you really feel the need to use the restroom under such circumstances? 
 - I'm sorry.

57
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:22,250
 Instead of thinking of using the restroom, you should wear a diaper from now on to take care of your business.

58
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,590
 As a nurse in the ICU, you should have at least that sense of duty.

59
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,200
There was a patient Nurse Heo took really great care after.

60
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,960
She bathed and spoke to that patient every day, even if he was unconscious.

61
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,820
By chance, do you mean the patient who passed away 2 weeks ago?

62
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,740
When the head nurse was assigning patient beds to us,

63
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,950
she recently assigned Nurse Heo other patient beds which were far away.

64
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,030
It's not a problem if the beds are close to each other,

65
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,710
but if they're far away, you can't hear the alarm.

66
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,000
 Move!

67
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,160
Nurse Heo must not have realized that his ventilator slipped while she was repositioning him.

68
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,720
The alarm rang while she was taking care of her other patients, but she didn't hear it.

69
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,270
I mean, why was she assigned beds so far away?

70
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,540
Nurse Heo talked back to the head nurse.

71
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,670
Did she punish Nurse Heo on purpose for talking back?

72
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:05,440
It just happened to be when the head nurse was already upset.

73
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,590
After that patient passed away, she kept blaming herself for it.

74
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:16,020
If only she hadn't spoken back to the head nurse, the patient bed assignments wouldn't have been done the way they were.

75
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,540
Then, she said she could've saved the patient.

76
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,030
She hadn't been in her right mind ever since the patient passed away.

77
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,190
So much that she couldn't properly fix a catheter.

78
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,170
What do you have to say that you would call me out here?

79
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,650
How was your date with Young Won yesterday?

80
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,610
What are you talking about?

81
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,510
Didn't you go to meet Young Won yesterday?

82
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,400
Did you call me up here to ask me that?

83
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:54,220
I met a nurse from the ICU,

84
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,240
to try to think of ways to convince the Hospital Director.

85
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,080
Did you find anything out?

86
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,310
The reason Nurse Heo... left like that.

87
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:07,440
As the new nurses of the ICU kept quitting,

88
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,870
their workloads were no joke.

89
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:14,330
So everyone was having a tough time, and the hazing between them was quite serious.

90
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,070
So how are you planning on carrying forward?

91
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:19,960
I need the help of the nurses in the hospital.

92
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,680
I'm wondering if I can get Nurse Oh's help. What do you think?

93
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,090
Isn't this getting too out of hand?

94
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,720
Well, we have to assume some risks.

95
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,730
So you're going to ask Nurse Oh yourself?

96
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,900
Yup. Why?

97
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,140
If you ask her, I don't think she'll do it.

98
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:42,390
Though what happened to Nurse Heo is unfortunate, I'm quite passive.

99
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,290
I hate taking action.

100
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,520
Nurse Oh, even just a few years ago, weren't you the activist type?

101
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,760
You used to make unions for nurses, too!

102
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:54,060
I did. And because of that I suffered a lot.

103
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,160
I fought for regular work hours and improved working conditions for nurses,

104
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,860
but do you know what I received? Disciplinary action and reduced wages.

105
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,720
And because my name got so stigmatized by my activism,

106
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,700
I can't change jobs to a different hospital.

107
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,000
Then why don't you fulfill your unfulfilled dreams at this opportunity?

108
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,130
They will never become true.

109
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,240
You fought alone back then, but this time, you'll have me!

110
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,930
He's right.

111
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:24,600
But Doctor, why are you suddenly meddling in the work of nurses?

112
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,270
I'm trying to prevent the next suicide.

113
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,200
I don't think this will be the end.

114
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,010
Are you saying someone else may take extreme measures following what happened?

115
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,790
Suicides are not just an individual issue.

116
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,210
Then what?

117
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,610
It's the responsibility of the community.

118
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,340
Before Nurse Heo's death, there was hazing,

119
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:49,290
and the source of the hazing is problems with the work conditions of the nurses.

120
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:53,860
If this system is not changed, don't you think the same thing could repeat itself?

121
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:59,820
Though fixing an illness is something a doctor should do, so is preventing it.

122
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,440
Do you think the signatures of the nurses will be enough?

123
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,090
Of course.

124
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:13,050
Dr. Lee, the Vice President has been consulting all of the nurses in the ICU

125
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,670
and investigating who the culprit may be.

126
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,330
Then we should hurry a bit.

127
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,600
 Intensive Care Unit

128
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,250
Why do you keep giving all the most severe cases to me?

129
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,360
You did that last time, too.

130
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,350
I can't do anything about it right now.

131
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:50,130
No increase in staff, and ICU is bursting with patients. So please endure it a bit.

132
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,150
Then can you take me out of the night shifts?

133
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,280
I can't do that!

134
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,500
- Nurse, I think the hemovac drain in patient 9 burst.
 - What?

135
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,740
It happened by accident while I was repositioning them. Sorrie~!

136
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,190
Sorrie? (~ang pronunciation at end to sound cute)

137
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,540
Are you out of your mind? How poorly did you reposition them that their hemovac drain would rip?

138
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,250
I didn't do it on purpose...

139
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,400
Nurse Na, call the head nurse.

140
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,760
Okay.

141
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,100
And get off the kid's back. It's only been a few days since Nurse Heo died...

142
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,980
Dr. Ji!

143
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,860
Ms. Woo Joo?

144
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,910
You're here?

145
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,990
What are you doing here? Are you here to see me?

146
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:49,220
I didn't come here intentionally, I was just passing by.

147
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,900
I wanted to you this.

148
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,150
What is this?

149
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:57,220
This is something Dr. Lee taught me

150
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,970
when I first met him.

151
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,420
If you have anything in your head, just say it into here and toss it out.

152
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,300
This seems like nothing,

153
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,250
but once you pour everything into here, I found it's very refreshing.

154
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:22,170
Um... I thought you would want to say something to the nurse who passed away.

155
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,990
Who knew I would be consoled by you like this?

156
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,620
And! One more thing. There's something I haven't told you.

157
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,510
What is it?

158
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,610
I've basically been hospital-shopping all this time.

00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,410
Going from this hospital to the next, I've been to a lot.

160
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:47,440
But this was the first place I went more than once.

161
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,770
You're a really incredible person.

162
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,550
Oh right! Should we take a picture together?

163
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,390
Suddenly?

164
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:06,090
How come we've never taken a picture all this time?

165
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,880
Smile.

166
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,610
Haha!

 Dr. Ji Young Won's dark circles are below her chin.

169
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,770
 She seems like she might need comfort from her friends.

170
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,630
Young Won! Did you sleep well?

171
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:39,670
How are you feeling? I'm wondering if you want to meet up later today.

One, two-

- Noona!
- Hey!

177
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,620
Hello teacher.

178
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,580
Wow, I almost couldn't recognize you!

179
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,740
When did you get here?

180
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,480
Just now. I was just looking around. It's bigger than I thought.

181
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,990
I keep getting more and more students.

182
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:28,950
There are lots of people who really want to be a musical actor these days.

183
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,980
Really.

184
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,860
Have you thought about it?

185
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,710
But... would I be able to do a good job?

186
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,480
I mean, I've never taught others before.

187
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,120
Do you know how much they're looking forward to you coming?

188
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,340
The students know me?

189
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,150
You're super famous!

190
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,050
You mean as the actress who got hand-cuffed on stage at an award show?

191
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:57,280
- Noona, you think anyone can get the new actress award? You're living out their dreams.  
 - Dream?

192
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,400
Me?

193
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,550
You'll know if you just try teaching one class. The students love you.

194
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,150
What about you? Things look good for you.

195
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:10,110
It's nice. I don't have to worry about making enough money.

196
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:15,040
It's become comfortable for me economically, but to be honest, I'm not that happy.

197
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,730
I gave up my dreams.

198
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:26,180
Noona, can you plant dreams in the students?

199
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,180
I don't have the right to do that.

200
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,030
Don't say those kind of things.

201
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,680
Okay. I'll try my best.

202
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:47,620
Hi, we're collecting signatures for a nurses' petition.

203
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,970
  Petition for Nurse's Working System Reformation

204
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:06,230
I'm collecting signatures for the petition. If it's alright with you, would you like to sign?

205
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,700
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

206
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:15,230
You just need to write here your name, date of birth, department, and signature.

207
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,460
  Petition for Nurse's Working System Reformation

208
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:31,360
Nurse Jung, what is this?

209
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,980
Who told you to do this?

210
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,330
Nobody told us to do it.

211
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:40,690
Nurse Heo was my colleague. I'm doing this voluntarily.

212
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,520
Sure.

213
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:54,770
Dr. In. Do you know why Nurse Jung is starting a petition for the nurses?

214
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,110
Yes, I do.

215
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,100
What are they planning?

216
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,190
They're not planning anything. They're trying to prevent more suicides.

217
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,250
Goodness. How?

218
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:09,240
If their working conditions improve, the culture of abuse may disappear, won't it?

219
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,220
Dr. In.

220
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,700
Don't you know that the Hospital Director and Chief Park are about to cut ties?

221
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,590
The Hospital Director is really determined to not give in.

222
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:23,590
We finally got this good opportunity, but what are you doing?

223
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:26,890
Is this a time for you to be swayed by Park Dae Ha and Lee Si Joon?

224
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,980
Sir, Nurse Heo was a patient in our department.

225
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,620
Do you know how many people are hospitalized with a mental illness?

226
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,060
If you add those who come for consultations into that mix, how many do you think that is?

227
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:44,490
To treat all those people, what do we need? A centralized system.

228
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,620
Isn't that why our hospital is setting up a Mental Health Center?

229
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,580
That's what I'm saying.

230
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:55,020
Is there a reason we should be touching the nerves of the Hospital Director right before it opens?

231
00:16:55,020 --> 00:17:00,730
Don't you dare participate in what's going on right now. Don't catch the eyes of the Hospital Director.

232
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,610
I understand.

233
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:11,010
We should let the Hospital Director know what Chief Park and Lee Si Joon are planning, right?

234
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,250
What do you think?

235
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:21,770
If you're planning on creating conflict, I think we should just wait and watch what happens.

236
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,050
Dr. In, you are special indeed.

237
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:41,160
I'm sorry about what happened earlier.

238
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,290
Don't make that kind of mistake again. I'm sorry for getting so worked up.

239
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:50,730
That's okay. Since I so frequently make mistakes, I'm thinking of just quitting.

240
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,910
- What? 
 - It's so scary here.

241
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,720
When I told my mom, she told me to quit immediately.

242
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,970
Won't it be better for you to quit, too?

243
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,550
You're funny. Why are you trying to drag me into it too?

244
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,990
Are you not aware?

245
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,760
- What? 
 - Do you really know nothing?

246
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,620
What is it?

247
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,450
 Dr. Lee Si Joon

248
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,590
 Dr. Lee Si Joon

249
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,470
Apparently there's a rumor that I killed her.

250
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:38,940
That she died because of me. They're saying I did things I didn't even do.

251
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,350
I'm going to quit immediately.

252
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,410
Nurse Na. If you quit now, you'll really be thought of as the perpetrator.

253
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:47,060
Then what am I supposed to do? The whole hospital is against me.

254
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:52,950
Nurse Na, you're not alone. You have me, and all the nurses at the hospital will help you.

255
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,000
Can you wait for us just a little?

256
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,100
I won't let you become the perpetrator alone.

257
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,170
If I really think about it, I didn't do anything right.

258
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:11,220
I've never spoken a kind word to Nurse Heo, even though I knew she was struggling.

259
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,720
We're all the same people.

260
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,780
We are bystanders.

261
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,170
- Enjoy your food.
 - Thank you.

262
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,210
Is it almost done?

263
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,900
You know this song, right?

264
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,700
I think so.

265
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,160
What if the choir sang this?

266
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,060
I think it'll be a bit difficult for the patients to sing.

267
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,890
What about this one?

268
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,550
What's the title for that one?

269
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,440
What was it?

270
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,530
I played that piece with the cello. You forgot it?

271
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,270
Anything else? Any other ideas?

272
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,220
Other pieces...

273
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,280
Can we have our check, please?

274
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,880
I'll be there soon!

275
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,080
That one sounds good. It has a good vibe.

276
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,900
One minute!

277
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:18,020
 Kong Rice House

278
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,180
When should we go-- Oh?

279
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,690
What about Ji Hee sunbae?

280
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,710
She told us to head home first.

281
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,460
The sisters must have something to discuss.

282
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,790
What's so serious?

283
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,630
It's not serious, but awkward.

284
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:54,720
If it's about what you said last time, don't worry about it. I've forgotten all about it.

285
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,900
- Are you really dating Dr. Lee? 
 - Yes.

286
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,500
Can you think about it one mor-

287
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,920
Never mind. I won't be bothered by it anymore.

288
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,600
Could you please do that?

289
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,660
Just know that I'm saying this because I'm worried about you.

290
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,290
I'll be heading in.

291
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,530
Yesterday, I met the Hospital Director.

292
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,720
Did you talk to her about it?

293
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,530
She tried to persuade me to help her, actually.

294
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:38,120
She's very determined, unlike before.

295
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,190
You said the two of you were classmates in high school right?

296
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,660
What kind of person is the Hospital Director?

297
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,210
Before, she had a strong sense of justice.

298
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,930
Then there's no reason she wouldn't understand.

299
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:50,830
Right?

300
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,470
- How are you? 
 - With what?

301
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:01,170
Aren't you depressed at all? You can't respond to something like this like others.

302
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,960
For some reason, I'm not depressed.

303
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,900
At any other time, if I heard news like this, I would hit rock bottom

304
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,820
and walk multiple laps around the trails.

305
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,490
Are you sure?

306
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,210
Why would I hide that?

307
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:22,080
If Han Woo Joo is going to continue with consultations,

308
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,920
change her appointment time to a less busy time.

309
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,260
Do I have to go to such lengths?

310
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,450
Nothing good will come of it if the Hospital Director finds out.

311
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,260
Let's live a little quietly.

312
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,660
Okay.

313
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,200
Sometimes, I think about when we were residents.

314
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,080
When? First year?

315
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:54,280
You mean when we didn't know how to do a single thing and was dragged everywhere by our patients?

316
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,690
Yeah.

317
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:58,310
Ji Young Won was especially bad.

318
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,510
- Me? 
 - Don't you remember? Who was that?

319
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:04,100
I think he might've been a pastor? The patient who heard things.

320
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,540
- You mean the patient who had dissociation disorder? 
 - Yea, that one.

321
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,780
Every time Young Won had a consultation with that patient, she was caught there for 10 hours.

322
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:16,350
She listened to everything he said, without interrupting him to even go to the bathroom.

323
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,290
How did you know that?

324
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:24,860
Right, she was the one that was most swayed by the patient's mood.

325
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,140
If the patient laughed, she laughed. If the patient cried, she cried.

326
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,060
You were worse than me on that one!

327
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,560
I think Young Won had the most difficulty in the ER.

328
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,990
That's right. When I had the night shift in the ER, I almost passed out.

329
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:40,790
Why? I loved the ER the most. I still do.

330
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:44,800
Young Won had such a difficult time with all the ER patients.

331
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,060
She's yelled at a patient before, asking if they were planning on dying? Right?

332
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,550
Why do you remember all those things?

333
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,940
I know, right?

334
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,850
Well, everyone has things they can't forget.

335
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,280
What do you remember?

336
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:13,610
The day I first saw symptoms of abnormality in my father.

337
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:20,040
And my mom's face the day they got a divorce.

338
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,910
For me, it's Nurse Heo's text.

339
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,140
Never mind. I'll leave first.

340
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,190
Why?

341
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:31,690
I have something to tell Nurse Heo's mom.

342
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:34,200
Do it later. If you go now, you'll only get in trouble.

343
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,500
I'm still going to go.

344
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,560
I think I should go with her.

345
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,390
Take care of this.

346
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,990
I'll go with you.

347
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:15,460

348
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,510
Woo Joo.

349
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,840
I just thought of a piece,

350
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,720
give it a listen.

351
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,220
What do you think?

352
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,030
- I've found the one. 
 - This one?

353
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,520
- We've found it! 
 - We found it.

354
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,840
But we can't use this exactly song. I'll edit it, so you change the lyrics.

355
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,170
Me?

356
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,540
I'll try it!

357
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:11,030
- This one, okay? 
 - Wait a  minute.

358
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,390
Hello?

359
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,960
Where are you? Where, where?

360
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,870
Okay I'll be right there!

361
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:26,530
I'm heading out!

362
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,790
Bye!

363
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:31,660
Goodness... do you like him that much?

364
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,420
Yes, I do.

365
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:50,990
Dr. Noh! I put the sign up that we're closed.

366
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:54,720
I came in because I saw that. You're closing down and heading home right?

367
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,150
Let's head out together.

368
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,210
To where?

369
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:01,460
Anywhere. The weather is nice.

370
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,120
Deal!

371
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,670
Oh, I did it again by accident!

372
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:28,420
Well, I don't think anyone really cares.

373
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,860
I'm not falling for that anymore.

374
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:35,590
Right? If you fell for that three times, you'd be a dummy.

375
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,790
 The person you are trying to call...

376
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:59,230
She's not picking up.

377
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:02,200
Let's just leave today and come back tomorrow.

378
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,980
Okay.

379
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,580
I came because I had something to tell you.

380
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:24,550
It's not about me, but Nurse Heo.

381
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:28,170
There's something Nurse Heo used to tell me during our consultations.

382
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:31,750
I thought it was something you should know.

383
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:37,520
Just tell me what you need to say and leave.

384
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,460
Nurse Heo told me

385
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:47,920
that when you left her at her father's house after your divorce,

386
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,590
she didn't think you had just tossed her away.

387
00:28:52,530 --> 00:29:00,460
She said she couldn't think that...

388
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,130
because of how many times you turned around as you left.

389
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:09,950
So when she met you again after she turned 20,

390
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:12,840
she was really happy and glad.

391
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,360
She wanted to go to famous restaurants and travel with you.

392
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:25,540
There are so many things she wanted to do with you, but she wasn't sure if she could because your relationship was awkward.

393
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:31,260
She thought her mother felt too guilty about leaving her.

394
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:36,090
Min Young's biggest worry was about

395
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:39,760
how she could best get close to you.

396
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:45,670
Even when she went to eat with me,

397
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,230
she kept saying she'd better come here with her mother.

398
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,250
 Depression is not just a state of being sad.

399
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:30,650
 It's an empty state of your mind being empty and your body being paralyzed.

400
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:36,650
 You're in a state of despair, without energy or the strength to do anything.

401
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:40,790
Dr. Lee, isn't the moon beautiful?

402
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,490
Let's dance.

403
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:53,980
What?

404
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:00,270
♫  Because you know I'm all about that bass  ♫

405
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:07,150
 When we love someone, we are facing that person's life.

406
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:14,760
 This means we have to be prepared to understand all that they've hidden in their hearts, including their traumas.

407
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:20,990
 Fortunately, oxytocin increases love, trust, and the feeling of solidarity.

408
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:25,460
 Endorphins alleviate pain.

409
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,350
 Exercise, sunlight,

410
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:39,420
 and the small events that bring joy alter the changes that are caused by stress

411
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:43,040
 reverting the processes of depression.

412
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,210
When I was younger,

413
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:49,500
 Just like how the flap of one butterfly's wings

414
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,140
 can cause a windstorm on the other side of the planet.

415
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:04,930
Dr. Lee, what's wrong? Are you uncomfortable somewhere?

416
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:09,440
I... I've lived my life the wrong way.

417
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:15,950
It hurts so much right here. It hurts, and I regret everything.

418
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:22,710
Just 30 years. I want to go back 30 years.

419
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:25,810
I ruined everything.

420
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:28,780
Why did you live like that?

421
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,750
You idiot!

422
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:35,190
Idiot...

423
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:38,460
You idiotic bastard!
