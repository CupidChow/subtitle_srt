1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,510

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,770
Dr. Lee, I've...

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,580
liked Woo Joo ever since I first met her.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:16,070
She's honest and fierce. She doesn't act sly and can't stand injustice.

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,640
She hates disadvantages even more.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,430
But Dr. Lee, Woo Joo has suddenly become a dummy.

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,900
She keeps hiding away all her emotions.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,640
She's become timid and she's lost her pride.

9
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,740
She experiences things that should anger her, but she doesn't get angry.

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,160
I'm worried about her because her temper is suddenly gone.

11
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,680
A person should live as they were born. They can't try to change themselves by force.

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,910
They'll get ill if they do that.

13
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,960
She didn't mean it when she said she wanted to quit her job.

14
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,050
Do you know how happy she was working there?

15
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,440
Dr. Lee, can't you just turn a blind eye and hold on to her?

16
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,850
A long time ago, I made a decision.

17
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,990
That decision has been wavering recently,

18
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,440
because of Ms. Woo Joo.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,970
I'm looking for reasons to convince myself.

20
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,470
Ms. Woo Joo.

21
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,540
Doctor.

22
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,470
Why are you out here like this? You should've gone inside if you came.

23
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:39,880
I was just aimlessly walking... and I ended up here.

24
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,990
Did something happen?

25
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,460
I don't have a single friend anymore.

26
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,000
Now that I think there's no one on this planet who will be on my side,

27
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,090
I'm so sad and

28
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:58,680
I just... feel so frustrated,

29
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,510
so I just walked aimlessly.

30
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,660
Since you came to me, I'll be your friend.

31
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,930
Really?

32
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,700
What should we do now, as friends?

33
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,680
Let's go to the ocean!

34
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,210
Let's go to the ocean then!

35
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,960
You said you wanted to go to the ocean.

36
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:35,320
Doctor, I really... Why are my emotions all over the place?

37
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:41,770
Sometimes I feel like dying because everything is so difficult, and then suddenly my mood has been lifted.

38
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,540
Then, it'll hit rock bottom right away.

39
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,360
Even now,

40
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,830
I told you I wanted to see the ocean,

41
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,280
but then I made a quick U-turn because I was drawn by those sparkly lights.

42
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,150
So what if  you're that way? You can just live as you feel fit.

43
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,110
That's okay.

44
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,970
Am I really okay?

45
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,550
I'll give you  a prescription, so your depression can go away.

46
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,570
Go find that person, and tell him that you want to keep doing theatrical therapy.

47
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,330
That last time, you just spouted out empty words out of anger.

48
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,850
That to you, this work is really important right now.

49
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:30,140
That in order for you to keep getting treatment, you need to do this work.

50
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,400
 I think the reason you help people who are in pain

51
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,650
 is because you're in even more pain.

52
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,740
 Mr. Son, the operator of 'Voy-tor; who has been on the run,

53
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,260
 has been captured by the cyber investigation team of the Seoul Metropolitan Police.

54
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,000
 Mr. Son, who is a plastic surgeon,

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,980
 created a page called 'Voy-tor' on an online portal site

56
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,990
 where only doctors could become members

57
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,270
 to see and post secret content of women.

58
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,390
 He is facing charges for the spread of this content.

59
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:50,900
It's such a relief that the operator of that website isn't a doctor from our hospital.

60
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,370
An operator or member, they're all the same.

61
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,880
Since the operator has been caught, the identities of all the members should get revealed, right?

62
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,320
Of course, they should get revealed.

63
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,370
I'm worried our hospital will also get exposed.

64
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,730
I think at the very least, all of the doctors at our hospital just looked out of curiosity.

65
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,730
You know, a needle thief turns into a cow thief. 
 (T/N: Korean saying meaning that crimes always start small.)

66
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:15,400
That's why we're taking initiative.

67
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:22,550
Please respond to my statement using an O or an X.

68
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:29,280
Have you gone to a special location or browsed the internet in order to watch pornography?

69
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,590
Even during consultations,

70
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:42,590
have you logged on to those illegal websites to watch that kind of content?

71
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:52,260
Have you ever watched pornography before the age of 18?

72
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,720
Has your personal or social life been influenced

73
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,840
by an inability to complete or execute well work that you had to do

74
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,930
due to watching pornography?

75
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,840
You feel anxious and ashamed, right?

76
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,920
You feel shortness of breath, sweaty, and frustrated, right?

77
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:37,380
Once voyeurism is developed, it cannot be controlled.

78
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,060
You start searching for more provocative content,

79
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,630
until you won't even be satisfied from catching a few glimpses.

80
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,310
You'll eventually start showing off yourself to others, developing an exhibitionistic disorder.

81
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,600
Are you calling me a pervert?

82
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,850
Just now, just hearing the phrase 'pornography'

83
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,700
made you think of all the things you've seen up until this point, didn't it?

84
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,000
Stop turning me into some kind of trashy person.

85
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:08,310

86
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,430
He's more committed to this than I thought.

87
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,470
Are you nervous?

88
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,410
You can't even make eye contact with me.

89
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,550
Is it because I'm a woman?

90
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,220
I'm not a woman, but a psychiatrist.

91
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,300
It's not that.

92
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,360
I can't stand this anymore.

93
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,570
I'm really sorry.

94
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,440
Why is he being like that?

95
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,300
Is this something you've personally confirmed?

96
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,600
I couldn't confirm it myself because the website was shut down,

97
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,330
but it seems like the people who saw it took screenshots and sent it to others.

98
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,920
I have a colleague who saw it.

99
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,740
Does Nu Ri not know about it... at all?

100
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,380
I don't think she could even imagine such a thing.

101
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,830
If she knew, she wouldn't have stayed quiet.

102
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,820
Those horrible bastards—

103
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,000
Kang Nu Ri is doing consultations, and she doesn't even know that.

104
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,310
Why are you working so hard?

105
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,460
He's my first patient.

106
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,920
After the consultation, I thought there may be other issues as well.

107
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,920
I want to fully treat him.

108
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,280
But his personality is too timid.

109
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,910
He can't even make eye contact with me.

110
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:06,190
I looked into it a bit. People who are a bit timid,

111
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,450
if they were shocked by pornography as a child,

112
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:15,730
or were not given proper sex education, are more likely to develop voyeurism.

113
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,610
Kang Nu Ri.

114
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,610
- Let's make a different patient your first. 
 - What?

115
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:29,320
You should let me take over that patient,

116
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,710
and drop out of the paraphilia case.

117
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,920
Why? Did I do something wrong?

118
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,650
- No, it's not that— 
 - Then why are you doing this?

119
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:45,360
You're... a victim of this case.

120
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,130
What does that—

121
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,880
We will now begin our seminar

122
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,310
regarding the medications that should be used for patients with voyeurism

123
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,480
and preventative care required for these cases.

124
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,960
Who are you?

125
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,830
It was you, right? You're the one that took pictures of me and posted them on 'Voy-tor', right?

126
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,430
I-It's not me. It's not.

127
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,490
What do you mean, it's not you?

128
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,080
That's why you couldn't even look at me properly in the eye!

129
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,970
Hey! Did you like stealing glances at me?

130
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,970
Should I show you more? Do you want to see more?

131
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,060
All doctors and professors here,

132
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:49,680
this person discreetly took pictures of me and posted them on that popular 'Voy-tor' website.

133
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,960
I didn't even know this, and spent all night studying in the library

134
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,230
trying to help him fix his voyeurism.

135
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,200
What a horrible turn of events is this?

136
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,570
Nu Ri, what are you doing?

137
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:05,730
Why? He'll only know once he experiences it himself!

138
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,900
What is feels like to be naked in front of the world!

139
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,450
It's not me!

140
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,700
I didn't post that. I only saw it!

141
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,830
I'm sorry.

142
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,500
Was it too early to assign a patient to Kang Nu Ri?

143
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,910
That seems to be the case.

144
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:34,110
I think it makes sense from Kang Nu Ri's perspective.

145
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:40,690
What do you mean, it makes sense? Does it make sense that a doctor would reveal confidential information about her patient like that, in front of all those people?

146
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,820
She should have kept Dr. Kang Nu Ri separate from victim Kang Nu Ri.

147
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,360
Well, sure. Okay.

148
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,130
But those pictures... are you sure it was that attending who took them?

149
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,650
Well, since we reported it, it should be revealed soon who it was.

150
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:59,790
Remove Kang Nu Ri from this case, and you take that attending as your patient.

151
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,030
Okay.

152
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:06,340
Chief, a perpetrator is a perpetrator, but shouldn't we treat the victim first?

153
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,520
I did think about that as well, but I'm not too sure.

154
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,300
In situations like this, victims don't usually reveal themselves.

155
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:18,250
I'll discuss it with the Hospital Director and try to come up with a solution.

156
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,600
I think the Emergency Department attending's condition was a bit severe.

157
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,870
He looks like he's ready to take off his doctor's coat and run out any second now.

158
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,040
Stop thinking about it and call Han Woo Joo.

159
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,520
You need Han Woo Joo for the patients.

160
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,960
Do you have other feelings for Han Woo Joo?

161
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,030
What are you talking about?

162
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,640
I mean, you keep hesitating.

163
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,430
What exactly are you so afraid of?

164
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:53,650
It's not for Han Woo Joo, but for the patients.

165
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:59,320
Kang Nu Ri needs to get treatment, too. Are you going to let those victims go through what Nu Ri did?

166
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,330
Think about it.

167
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,850
I'm running into you often.

168
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,460
I heard about the psychiatry attending.

169
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,710
Are those the methods for psychological treatment?

170
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,170
Public shaming?

171
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,940
You said you would ensure my confidentiality.

172
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,380
You're just barging into a normal person's life.

173
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,160
Barging in?

174
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,450
Is that how you return favors?

175
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,810
You're at risk of losing your license as a doctor,

176
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:37,070
and yet we're offering you treatment. Don't you feel anything?

177
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:46,590
Maybe you weren't just viewing the site but posting things as well?

178
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,880
It was you, wasn't it?

179
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,190
You've never thought about the victim's perspective, have you?

180
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:06,910
Do you think we wanted to treat trashy humans like you because you're so precious to us?

181
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,990
That's not it!

182
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:14,210
It's because people like you will only turn into trashier humans because  you'll keep looking for more provocative things.

183
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,970
Then, another victim will be created.

184
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:22,910
That's why we're giving you treatment. Not for your benefit, but to prevent any more victims from being created.

185
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:27,710
Do you think you're any different from those barbarians on the streets because you wear a gown and watch it in secret?

186
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:33,500
You're all the same. The symptoms may be a bit different, but it's the same paraphilia!

187
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,320
My favor ends here. You can get our help and fix your illness,

188
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,790
or keep doing those things in secret and face even more shame later. It's up to you.

189
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,520
- What? 
 - What.

190
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,990
Don't you have something to say to me?

191
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,780
I don't.

192
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,920
I'm going to meet Dr. Lee Si Joon.

193
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,110
Are you letting him know you're going?

194
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,760
I'm just going to barge in.

195
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,710
If I ask him for the favor but he doesn't agree, I'm going to lay down and throw a tantrum.

196
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:40,080
Ha! Now you're a bit like Han Woo Joo.

197
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,770
I wanted to ask you if you would come back to the hospital.

198
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:01,940
The Social Welfare Committee tried really hard to look for another part-time worker,

199
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:05,580
but there was no one quite as good as you.

200
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:09,670
I told them it would be hard to ask you to return,

201
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,000
but they all said it won't do, if it's not you.

202
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,610
They asked me to at least try making an offer to you. That's why I came.

203
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,980
I'll ask you for this favor.

204
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,470
Oh, really?

205
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,020
I mean... well, since you've come all the way here,

206
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,620
it's a bit difficult for me to turn your offer down.

207
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,910
Thank you.

208
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,630
But I have one condition.

209
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:55,170
So you're telling me to sing... to these?

210
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,260
I've been singing to them every day,

211
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:04,900
but I've been thinking that maybe they also need to hear a man's voice to grow well.

212
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:12,710
I— What do you mean, sing? To this?

213
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,070
Please!

214
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:19,160
I— I can't sing.

215
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,030
Do you think the flowers will care about things like that?

216
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,250
Hurry up!

217
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,590
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4—

218
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:43,230
M-Mom— Mom.

219
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:47,120
♫ Mom, don't worry about me.  ♫

220
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,160
♫ Mom, your son is doing fine.  ♫

221
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:57,180
♫ If the same days keep making you tired, then just take a deep breath. Yeah. ♫

222
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:04,060
♫ Phew. Try letting out a deep breath. ♫

223
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:10,000
♫ Phew, try counting from one to ten. ♫

224
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,680
♫ Phew, once the long day is over.  ♫

225
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:24,700
♫ Phew, why can't I forget you? ♫

226
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:34,200
♫ Phew, phew, phew, phew.  ♫

227
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,410
Oh my gosh, I'm so embarassed! Why are you making me do this?

228
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,230
You're so good!

229
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,330
I'm embarrassed.

230
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,720
Goodness!

231
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,310

232
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:28,740
 I think I'll have to take on a variety of roles for this treatment.

233
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,870
 I can see now why you needed me.

234
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,180
 That's why I had to ask for your favor.

235
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,750
 We needed you.

236
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:45,390
 To be honest, I was actually planning on going to you first.

237
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,820
 Okay, Mr. Shin Jong Shik?

238
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:09,360
This is a space for us to listen to your inner thoughts.

239
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:15,260
I'm sure it'll be a bit unfamiliar to you, but please act as you would in a real situation like this.

240
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,040
Okay.

241
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,590
She is a police officer.

242
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,950
How could someone who calls himself a doctor,

243
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:37,340
have nothing better to do than secretly take pictures of women,

244
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,960
and spread them to his friends? Is that something you people should be doing?

245
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:52,020
As you were looking at all the women who were being posted on that website,

246
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,970
you mistook them as some sort of objects that you own, right?

247
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:00,420
Did you think you had some kind of control over those women?

248
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,320
Even though you can't say even a single word to a woman in real life,

249
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:15,750
you felt superior to them while secretly viewing pornographic images of them on the website.

250
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,880
Mr. Shin Jong Shik, do you have nothing you want to say?

251
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,100
Don't hold anything back and say it.

252
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:26,940
That's not true.

253
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:31,810
Did you think you were above all of those women?

254
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,060
You fool with a superiority complex.

255
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,390
I'm telling you that's not it.

256
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:40,150
Then what is it? Were you maybe insulted by your first date?

257
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,670
No! It's not like that.

258
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:46,690
You've never been noticed by a single woman in your whole life, have you?

259
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,470
I'm telling you— No! That's not it!

260
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,390
From here,

261
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:11,040
you, Mr. Shin, are a 15-year-old male going through puberty.

262
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,820
You just got back from school, but your mother seems very angry.

263
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,790
Why is she so angry?

264
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,750
What is this?

265
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,000

266
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,980
Why is something like this coming out of your room?

267
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:36,290
Why are you already looking at something like this? You're so pathetic!

268
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,340
What kind of thoughts did you have while looking at this?

269
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,020
What kind of dirty thoughts did you have?

270
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,310
It wasn't that, I just—

271
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,890
I'm asking what you did!

272
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:49,250
Shin Jong Shik, you have something to say. Say it.

273
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,790
I was just curious. I didn't do anything wrong.

274
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:56,590
In the time you spent doing this, you could have memorized an extra vocab word for English!

275
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:59,550
Jong Shik, please!

276
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:04,620
Don't you know how difficult it is for us? Our whole family is depending on you.

277
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:09,270
Do you know how hard your dad and I worked to raise you?

278
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:12,180
Do you have time to be looking at things like this?

279
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,630
I did wrong.

280
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:18,740
You— You'll only come to your senses once you get a beating from your father.

281
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,820
I-I did wrong!

282
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,930
- I won't do it again! I really— 
  - Let go!

283
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:42,840
Now your younger sister is here.

284
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,630
Oppa,

285
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:56,690
on the subway... someone secretly took pictures of me.

286
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:03,480
Some bastard took pictures of me and posted them on a website called 'Voy-tor'.

287
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:10,130
It means that those doctors are looking at my pictures right now and imagining all sorts of things!

288
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:14,210
Those demons are stepping all over me.

289
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:17,410
Oppa, you're a doctor.

290
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,420
How— How could doctors be like this?

291
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:23,590
Is it okay for the world to become so crazy and out of control like this?

292
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,700
I'm sorry.

293
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:34,190
It's all my fault. I was wrong.

294
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,580
What are you sorry about?

295
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:51,610
I— I'm trash.

296
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:57,190
I knew what I was doing was trashy,

297
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,540
but I couldn't stop.

298
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:07,890
Every time things got too difficult to handle,

299
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:10,890
- I didn't even—
 - You didn't just see things, right?

300
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:13,690
You took those pictures yourself and posted them.

301
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,460
Do you feel guilt? What for?

302
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:25,040
I did it.

303
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:34,250
Those pictures. The pictures of doctors from our hospital.

304
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,660
I took those.

305
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,180
I didn't know you were a doctor at our hospital.

306
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,570
I'm really sorry.

307
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,460
I'm really sorry.

308
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:01,850
Mr. Shin Jong Shik, I understand you suffered from a traumatic experience.

309
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:06,940
However, that doesn't justify your actions.

310
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:13,070
Secretly filming sexual content of other people is a very bad thing to do.

311
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:17,820
We will help you with treatment,

312
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,560
but you'll have to take responsibility for the crime you committed.

313
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,580
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

314
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,290
I...

315
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:45,650
really like it here.

316
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:52,180
Thank you for letting me work again.

317
00:27:53,160 --> 00:28:01,030
When I was 6, I went to the ocean with my mom.

318
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:06,040
We spent a long time digging for clams and catching crabs.

319
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,990
Before we knew it, it was high tide.

320
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:13,560
The ocean water kept flooding in, and I was so scared.

321
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:25,030
Then, my mom put me on her back and started walking through the ocean waves.

322
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:33,810
The scent of her back, the hairs that tickled my face,

323
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:38,680
and the water that came all the way up to her thighs,

324
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:44,040
I can see all of it. Still.

325
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:49,890
To me, that's happiness.

326
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,130
That moment was the happiest time of my life.

327
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,590
When I come here,

328
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:09,970
it's not as much as that moment, but I feel like I'm on my mom's back.

329
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:15,320
 I didn't ask any questions.

330
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,660
 Where is that mother now?

331
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,560
What's going to happen to that patient now?

332
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:45,660
Since he turned himself in to the police, I think he's set on getting treatment.

333
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:49,040
The issue is the addiction.

334
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,220
I didn't know things like that were addictions as well.

335
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,960
Well, it's similar to being addicted to drugs or alcohol.

336
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,490
You keep looking for stronger, more provocative things,

337
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,390
and that could grow into an exhibitionistic disorder.

338
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,850
Ultimately, they ruin themselves,

339
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:12,300
and unimaginable things happen. Your life will be over in one go.

340
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,880
Good work today.

341
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,190
You too, Doctor.

342
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:28,250
Oh right, wait a minute.

343
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,220
I bought this earlier, and meant to give it to you, but couldn't.

344
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:45,780
If you don't like it, you can just throw it away.

345
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,800
Can you put it on for me?

346
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,340
Head in.

347
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:13,320

348
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:20,050
♫  The endlessly dark evening road is narrow and far.   ♫

349
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:26,780
♫  When you don't know where to go,  ♫

350
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:34,220
♫  I'll be there for you, on the corner of the road.   ♫

351
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:39,910
♫  It'll all be okay, so don't worry.  ♫

352
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:43,600

353
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,760
 Do you know what my bracelet's name is? Bandage.

354
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,250
 Will I be able to fix it before the election?

355
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:53,740
 I heard you had an accident a month ago. Was it because of your panic disorder?

356
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,300
 Do you really not know where they went?

357
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,270
 St— Stepmother?

358
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:59,390
 She raised Woo Joo for about 6 years when she was young.

359
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,860
 Do you think I can't find you if you run away?

360
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,910
 I'm going to find you!

361
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:07,350
 But Dr. Lee, do you know your feelings well?

362
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,860
 I don't understand mine.

363
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,660
 Ms. Woo Joo!

364
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,110
 Han Woo Joo!

365
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:15,800
♫  The memories you speak of  ♫
