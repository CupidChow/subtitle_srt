1
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,320
Hey!

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,960
- Did you wait long? 
 - No.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,770
- Did the patient contact you? 
 - Yes.

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,920
She must've really liked that the Lieutenant Colonel came.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,840
She said that all of her despair towards the military disappeared.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,740
That's good.

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,590
How should I repay my gratitude?

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,850
Should I buy you a drink?

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,090
Better than that...

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,580
You have something to say to me, don't you?

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,720
It's about Dong Hyuk.

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,150
Why? Did something happen to him?

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,740
I think he's going through something, but I don't know what it is.

14
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,640
Dong Hyuk isn't very open about those things,

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,930
even though he always gets found out in the end.

16
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,220
He asked me last time if he could move to our hospital.

17
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,770
I'm sure it was a joke, but he seemed a bit off.

18
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,290
Did you not ask him why?

19
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,850
I think you'll need to find the answer to that one.

20
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,800
I mean, I can ask him but he won't answer.

21
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,160
Why does he always hide what he's thinking?

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,310
Did you show your thoughts?

23
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,730
Did you show Dong Hyuk what you were thinking?

24
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,890
I was right on, wasn't I?

25
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,620
Ji Young Won... You really are my primary doctor.

26
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:34,470
Theatrical therapy has the purpose of helping those with wounds in their minds heal.

27
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,500
We try to draw out the difficult situations through acting,

28
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,130
and help treat the patients by having them act in these situations.

29
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,870
You can think of it as a type of psychological treatment for patients

30
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,880
through establishing a sense of stability.

31
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,230
If you become a theatrical therapist—

32
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,420
♫  My difficult day   ♫

33
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,410
♫  gets a little better.  ♫

34
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:14,130
♫  My world that has changed with just you.  ♫

35
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,930
♫  Do you feel the same way as me?  ♫

36
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,890
What did you do all day? You wouldn't even pick up my calls.

37
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,430
 I was super busy today!

38
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,720
In the afternoon, I worked part-time at the academy. Then at night, I had some other business.

39
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,870
What business?

40
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,750
I already told you it's a secret. Why do you keep asking?

41
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,390
Do you think secrets really exist? I'll find out eventually.

42
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:42,020
I want to tell you even less now that you're being curious.

43
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,600
- I'm not curious at all. 
 - I know you are!

44
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,870
It's a bit annoying now, right?

45
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,080
Since I really won't tell you?

46
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,820
I can hear it in your voice!

47
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,570
I'm home now. I'll hang up!

48
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:04,930
♫  The soft evening breeze is like your voice.  ♫

49
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:12,330
♫  When I turn my head, it's full of you.  ♫

50
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:17,570
♫  The entire world is you.  ♫

51
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,040
 Registration Complete

52
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,670

53
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:51,570
 Dr. Lee doesn't have much time left before he'll stop recognizing people.

54
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:20,310
 Si Joon... I'm so relieved that sometimes my mind comes back

55
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:26,230
 so that I can talk to you.

56
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,300
 Though I'm sure it won't be for long.

57
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,990
Thank you, Si Joon,

58
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,370
for being my son.

59
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:45,740
I was... a lacking father.

60
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,900
I never knew

61
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,680
how I was supposed to spend time with my son,

62
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,910
or what to say to you.

63
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:08,070
I thought if I succeeded, it'll be good for my son, too.

64
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,750
So I just worked hard.

65
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,290
I used work as an excuse. We never went on vacation

66
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:20,460
or went to an amusement park like you always wanted to.

67
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,750
I didn't think I would regret it this much.

68
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,430
Now, I can't even go if I want to.

69
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:43,260
All the regret from not being able to do that simple thing...

70
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,980
is right here in my heart...

71
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,390
Dear son, I am sorry.

72
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,690
It's no use regretting it now,

73
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:08,050
but I have so many things I want to say sorry to you about.

74
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,070
Having trouble?

75
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,430
Look here.

76
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:25,530
If you found the distance between A and B this way,

77
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,470
you can calculate tan(x).

78
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,850
If you compare the distance from C to D, and Q and R,

79
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,270
it's half the length and similar width.

80
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,270
- Dr. In. 
 - Yes?

81
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,260
It was quite the sight, seeing you help Jin Woo with math.

82
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:53,290
Well, he kept worrying that he couldn't go to his academy if he was here.

83
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,030
- I'm mentioning it because it was nice to see. 
 - Oh, I see.

84
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:02,690
I used to think that helping patients recover and be rid of symptoms was the most important thing,

85
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,570
instead of focusing on other things.

86
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,660
That's why I used to have conflicting opinions with Dr. Lee Si Joon.

87
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,060
But now I've changed.

88
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,410
At times, there are needs to look at other parts

89
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:17,120
of the patient's lives, not just the symptoms.

90
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,520
I thought it'd be okay if you take superfluous interest in helping someone who is hurt.

91
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,420
As much and as deeply as you can.

92
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,950
 Is this something I can ignore?

93
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,780
 My friend is about to get beat up.

94
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,110
 I saw something when we were 4th year residents.

95
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,290
 I know... I know you're thoughtful,

96
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:55,260
 and know you don't like talking much about these kinds of things.

97
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,730
 I know you'll resolve it well on your own if I just turn a blind eye.

98
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,880
 But... this time I need to hear it myself.

99
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,500
 - It's not like you. Why? 
 - Because you did that, too.

100
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,710
- You're here? 
 - Did you wait long?

101
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,370
Not much. Maybe about 30 minutes?

102
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,830
What brings you all the way here?

103
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,160
I just thought our Hospital Director may be upset at me for a lot of things,

104
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,710
so I wanted to resolve those feelings.

105
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:39,020
I also felt bad about not being able to do much for you as a friend.

106
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,370
At least you know.

107
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:46,150
Goodness.

108
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,130
How are things lately? Nothing going on, right?

109
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,060
Are you asking about my siblings?

110
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,700
How else would they be?

111
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,240
They all are itching to eat the others up.

112
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,370
The only relief is that the company's image seems to be improving again.

113
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,360
That's good.

114
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:12,130
Do you know what I'm the most envious of in the world?

115
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:16,940
'During holiday, all my siblings gathered to play hwatu.'
 (T/N: Hwatu is a flower card game popular in Korea)

116
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,620
'All my siblings went on vacation together.'

117
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,390
Things like that.

118
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,760
Do you need to share blood to be siblings?

119
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,670
Long-time friends are more than siblings.

120
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,930
Aren't you lonely?

121
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:38,240
Don't you miss your daughter?

122
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,860
I miss her so much I could die.

123
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:47,720
One day, I may just disappear.

124
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,700
You can't disappear yet. The Mental Health Clinic is opening soon.

125
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,840
I want Park Dae Ha to be the Clinic Director.

126
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,290
- Me? 
 - Why are you acting so surprised?

127
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,090
Have you never thought about it?

128
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:04,770
I thought you were thinking of Vice President Oh.

129
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,960
Ever since I thought of establishing a Mental Health Clinic,

130
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,770
the Clinic Director was you, Park Dae Ha.

131
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,370
Are you just clueless or do you have no interest?

132
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,790
You're not going to reject my offer, are you?

133
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,610
Well... Let me think about it for a few days.

134
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:28,040
Optimistically, okay?

135
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,460
It's really great weather for a picnic.

136
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,480
It's nice.

137
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,640
Did you understand what I just said?

138
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,140
You really must be excited.

139
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:20,550
It's nice to see you so happy.

140
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,400
It's nice.

141
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,960
It's nice.

142
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,230
It's nice.

143
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,070
It's good.

144
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,800
You didn't used to like sweet things.

145
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,220
You're done for now.

146
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:48,250
Dr. In, a patient's guardian came and said some very weird things.

147
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,560
What is this all about?

148
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,900
Come have a seat.

149
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,360
Yes, sir.

150
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,320
I'm not sure what you heard or how you received it,

151
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,050
but none of it is the truth.

152
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,150
Then why is the guardian acting that way?

153
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,760
I can't trust you, Dr. In.

154
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,230
I've been backstabbed by you before.

155
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,570
Vice President Oh Gi Tae!

156
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,780
Dr. In, you try explaining the situation.

157
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:24,280
Yes. The patient is a 16-year old student.

158
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,580
He came to the ER after vomiting and experiencing pains.

159
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:32,450
His symptoms were the side effects of taking methylphenidates, which he had been taking regularly.

160
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,870
Afterwards, I became his primary doctor, and neither the patient nor his guardians wanted him to become hospitalized,

161
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,320
so he regularly received consultations-

162
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,210
But?

163
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,170
He was rushed to the ER two more times after the first incident.

164
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:47,650
The patient told me he had purchased the medicine off the internet and taken them again.

165
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:51,880
Then you should've hospitalized the patient using whatever means necessary!

166
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,570
I am at fault for that.

167
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,610
Dr. In, then why is the patient's guardian

168
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,210
talking about drugs?

169
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:02,740
The patient's guardian said you were a drug addict.

170
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,390
He said you told patient Kang Jin Woo yourself.

171
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:13,180
You tell me yourself. Did you or did you not take drugs?

172
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,820
Why can't you answer me?

173
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,670
I can't answer.

174
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,010
- What? 
 - I mean, I will not.

175
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:30,920
Chief Park, I don't think Dr. In can go to Johns Hopkins University.

176
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:36,040
There's no reason the Hospital Director would write him a recommendation letter once she finds out about this.

177
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,180
How unfortunate...

178
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,480
Why would you mention that now?

179
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,750
Dr. In. Dr. In!

180
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,500
 Have you had a change in heart?

181
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,880
It would've been nice if you had listened to me earlier.

182
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,940
I heard you hospitalized my son. You can't fix him.

183
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,670
He takes after me.

184
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:33,410
Guardian, sir. I may be crossing the line,

185
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,830
but I'll just say one thing.

186
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:41,730
First of all, Jin Woo does not take after you.

187
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:45,190
I briefly helped Jin Woo solve some math problems yesterday,

188
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:50,140
and Jin Woo is already understanding all the high-school level math.

189
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,540
Above all, Jin Woo...

190
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:57,440
is very determined not to live like his father.

191
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,840
He wants to get first place no matter what

192
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,800
so that he and his mother

193
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:13,240
can get independence from an abusive father who only knows how to use his fists-

194
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,830
as soon as possible. 
 - This punk, really-

195
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,410
What?

196
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,550
What do you mean, let's not write him a recommendation letter?

197
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:40,420
Did you really just say that?

198
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,710
Do you know how hard Dr. In worked for this?

199
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,290
He doesn't express it,

200
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,450
but he's done so much research by himself.

201
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,370
Can't you tell from him not answering my question?

202
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,700
He took the drugs.

203
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,030
Do you think those research results came out on its own?

204
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,680
He probably took stimulants to help him stay up all night to research.

205
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,870
Oh Gi Tae. You can't trust anyone around you, can you?

206
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,880
What the hell? Are you trying to pick a fight?

207
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,600
You used to make Dr. In do all your dirty work.

208
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,570
You even made him your personal driver!

209
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,310
Now you can't stand that he's starting to become successful?

210
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,730
What kind of person do you take me as?

211
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,170
The reason Dr. In didn't respond

212
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,930
is because you touched his pride!

213
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,220
Even having to deny such a ridiculous thing hurt his pride!

214
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,480
Until Dr. In says himself that everything is a misunderstanding

215
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,200
and that he's never done such things,

216
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,090
there will be no recommendation letter from the Hospital Director.

217
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,690
If things go well, it's all your credit, huh?

218
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,080
If things go wrong, it's all the fault of others?

219
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,050
What did you say?

220
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,520
As a psychological study,

221
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,400
they should've researched someone like you!

222
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,940
Just wait until I become the Clinic Director!

223
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:25,400
Thanks to you, my wish came true.

224
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,460
Thank you.

225
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,770
It's pretty.

226
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,760
How beautiful.

227
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,580
Did I come out of nowhere again?

228
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,840
It's okay.

229
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,200
Your face looks very bright.

230
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,010
Your heart must have become very calm.

231
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,580
Yes.

232
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:36,160
But... what did you want to ask me about?

233
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,380
First, promise that you'll keep it a secret from Dr. Lee.

234
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,380
I promise.

235
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,940
Dr. Ji, I...

236
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,650
was really happy when I was doing theatrical therapy at Eun Kang Hospital.

237
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,880
I really thought that I was alive.

238
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,640
I know how much you loved doing that work.

239
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,910
That's why... I want to properly do that work.

240
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,930
Really?

241
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:07,080
I've been looking into things and listening to information articles.

242
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,670
I've been doing my own type of research, too.

243
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,900
Then I ended up registering for a class.

244
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:16,660
Suddenly, I had a thought.

245
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,650
'Does someone like me have the right to do something like this?'

246
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:24,100
'Are my ambitions too much?'

247
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,430
I won't make a mistake again, will I?

248
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,930
You just said so youself.

249
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:36,030
- That when you do that, you feel alive. 
 - Yes.

250
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,960
Then what are you worried about?

251
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,340
You made the right choice. Congratulations.

252
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,080
Can you say that one more time?

253
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,540
Congratulations.

254
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,570
Thank you.

255
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,220
Father... Even if it's difficult,

256
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,590
please keep enduring it.

257
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,580
There are still lots of things I want to do with you.

258
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,600
You can only leave after I've done all those things.

259
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:24,960
All the times that you yelled at me and hurt me...

260
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,030
I'm going to get payment for all of that.

261
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:36,360
So you must endure.

262
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,650
Yes, Dong Hyuk?

263
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,700
Dong Hyuk!

264
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,510
What happened to your face?

265
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,670
I told you I would take care of it.

266
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:17,090
You pathetic... You resolved it like this?

267
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:22,300
- You don't know yet, right? Johns Hopkins extended an invitation to me. 
 - What?

268
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,200
They'll let me just do research for a whole year. They'll even pay me.

269
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,610
Oh, for the research paper you presented to the World Psychiatric Association?

270
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,020
And another thing.

271
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,220
Panic disorder clients and the impact of

272
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:37,100
medicinal treatment.

273
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,940
You did that kind of research, too?

274
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,710
Whenever you were chasing patients down, I was stuck in a research lab doing this type of stuff.

275
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:51,140
As I was doing that, I thought you were doing very useless things.

276
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:55,020
You did? Horrible jerk...

277
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,570
I don't think I can go to Johns Hopkins.

278
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,140
- Why not? 
 - I don't think I can get the Hospital Director's recommendation.

279
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,040
Why would you not be able to get that? That's not much.

280
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:09,640
The patient's guardian told them that I took drugs.

281
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,970
Is that true?

282
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,280
This little...

283
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,290
I got so surprised!

284
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:56,280
Why would you put vitamins in a bottle like this?

285
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,540
For the placebo effect.

286
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:00,300
Dammit... I was scared for nothing.

287
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,550

288
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,120
But...

289
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:10,570
placebo? 
 - I know that drug well.

290
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:17,570
- When did you take it? 
 - In high school.

291
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:21,780
I was attending academy using the money my mom got from cutting off her own toes.

292
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:25,360
I had to go to university.

293
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,850
I couldn't sleep.

294
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:35,780
Did you not hospitalized Kang Jin Woo because you were reminded of your younger self?

295
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,260
I couldn't look at it purely objectively.

296
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,940
It's all in the past now.

297
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,400
That was so long ago. That's before you became a doctor.

298
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,000
I took it when my mother passed away, too.

299
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,360
My mother passed away...

300
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,350
but it was like some burden had gone away,

301
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:56,330
and I suddenly started getting so tired.

302
00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:00,650
I was dozing off at the funeral.

303
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,810
So I took one capsule.

304
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,110
Stop it.

305
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:09,170
When you asked me if I took drugs,

306
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,230
I couldn't answer with a clear conscience.

307
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:15,430
Since I'm still taking the drugs in vitamin form...

308
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,990
That's why I couldn't answer you.

309
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:25,580
Lee Si Joon... You answer me.

310
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:33,310
Am I still taking drugs or not?

311
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:42,460
You're just living.

312
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:48,430
You're trying your best as a human and as a doctor.

313
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:55,150
As my friend, as Young Won's friend, as a good professor,

314
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,640
and as a skilled doctor.

315
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,310
You're just living.

316
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:08,190
You have the rights to a clear conscience.

317
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:10,160
I can guarantee it.

318
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,420
Who are you to guarantee it?

319
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,080
Me?

320
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,620
Because I'm Dr. Lee Taek Kyung's son, Lee Si Joon.

321
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,600
Cheers.

322
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,770
- Go home directly. 
 - I'm not going home.

323
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,900
What do you mean, no? Go home!

324
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,700
I'm not going!

325
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,520
- Go home. 
 - Nope...

326
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,830
Where are you going?

327
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,100
Young Won.

328
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,750
Were you waiting for me?

329
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,870
You know it'll become habit if you keep coming here when you're drunk-

330
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,140
What's wrong with your face? Did you get hit?

331
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,140
Who? Who hit you?

332
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:20,280
What did you for it to get this bad? Did you get into a fist fight?

333
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,840
There's no reason you would fight anyone...

334
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:28,230
You just got hit, didn't you?

335
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,710
Are you stupid?

336
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:01,840
♫  As much as I love you,  ♫

337
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:09,560
♫  If you loved me.  ♫

338
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,560
What brings you all the way to my house?

339
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,520
I came to see you, because you're so busy.

340
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,900
What shall I do? I think I'll keep being busy.

341
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,080
Oh right. I have something to give you.

342
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,960
Really? Good thing I came. What is it?

343
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,500
If you don't like it, you can toss it out.

344
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:44,170
I really don't like it.

345
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:46,110
Toss it.

346
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,650
Can you put it on me?

347
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,790
There.

348
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,760
It suits you.

349
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,020
Wear it every day!

350
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:22,310
Hey. What's going on?

351
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,000
Why are you making me exercise so early in the morning?

352
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,600
You need to exercise!

353
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,040
You should stop fainting here and there whenever you have a drink.

354
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,020
Here.

355
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,190
- What's this. 
 - This is the medicine Dong Hyuk takes.

356
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,350
They're vitamins.

357
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,050
What?

358
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:45,890
Please send Dong Hyuk to Johns Hopkins.

359
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:48,420
I'll head out first.

360
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:52,190
Hey! Lee Si Joon! Talk with me for a minute! Hey!

361
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,190
Hey! Lee Si Joon!

362
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:57,500
Hey, you punk! Stop right there!

363
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,120
Hey!

364
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,820
Please don't worry too much about Jin Woo.

365
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,080
He's adjusting better than expected.

366
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,000
He's also very determined to get treated.

367
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:15,110
The reason Jin Woo turned this way is all my fault.

368
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:18,890
I should've stopped him sooner.

369
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:21,870
I think I told him to study hard

370
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:26,220
and save me from his father.

371
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:32,920
I reported Jin Woo's father to the police myself.

372
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,170
What?

373
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:38,350
I heard he even asked you for money.

374
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:42,090
Now he's doing things like this?

375
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:46,070
I'll apologize to you 100 times over in his place.

376
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:49,720
I'm very sorry.

377
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,880
No, that's okay.

378
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,820
Dr. Lee made another event happen.

379
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,890
- Chief, are you aware of it? 
 - What kind of event?

380
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:03,680
For the family of a soldier who died of an accident during his service,

381
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:09,110
he found the Lieutenant Colonel and asked him to see the family on the death anniversary.

382
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:14,020
The Lieut. Col. complimented him so much his mouth probably dried out. He said it was very memorable.

383
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,020
That's Dr. Lee's methods.

384
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,620
Thanks to him, my reputation has redeemed itself a bit.

385
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:24,110
Our hospital was complimented a bit in front of my siblings, too.

386
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:26,860
How do you know the colonel?

387
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,400
Don't you know the world is small?

388
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:35,230
The opening is approaching...

389
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:38,560
and I have to decide on a Clinic Director.

390
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,740
Have you thought about my offer?

391
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,850
About that...

392
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:51,700
I'm thinking of giving you a new offer.

393
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,960
It seems quite serious, judging from your expression.

394
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,080
What is it?

395
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:05,660
- Woo Jung Sunbae! 
 - What is it?

396
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:11,250
They've decided who the Mental Health Clinic Director will be.

397
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:14,220
- Who is it? 
 - That is...

398
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:27,140
 Eun Kang Medical Center

399
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,470
Hello, Hospital Director.

400
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:46,760

401
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,210
 Hospital Director

402
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:01,590
 ♫ If I had considered it a little longer ♫

403
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:05,030
 Fix You

404
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:09,180
 I have something I'm contemplating, but I think I'll get the answer if I'm with you.

405
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:12,650
 The first Director of the Mental Health Clinic...

406
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,960
 What? I can't acknowledge this!

407
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,390
 Do I seem very different these days to you, too?

408
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,990
 What's so good about the Director position?

409
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,640
 I'm sure there's wiretapping in my room.

410
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,160
 I heard nobody in the world isn't hurt.

411
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,150
 I wanted to know how you were.

412
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,970
 I have something to tell you today.

413
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:33,050
 When we overcome our pains, what happens to us?
