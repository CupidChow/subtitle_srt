1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,960
Hold on, hold on.

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,590
What are you so apprehensive of?

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,200
You can't trust me?

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,040
No.

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,510
I don't suspect you, Doctor.

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,730
I know you worried about me all day yesterday

7
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,130
and you even waited for me in front of my home, I know that.

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,990
But then... why?

9
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,690
For what you've done for me,

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,980
I am grateful.

11
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,270
Episode 21

12
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:22,660

13
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,890
You didn't know, did you?

14
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,710
That I would be waiting by the door.

15
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,730
You were surprised, weren't you?

16
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,670
No, I knew it all.

17
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,770
You did not.

18
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,420
What I meant was that I knew what was happening to you, Woo Joo.

19
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,060
That's why I kept telling you,

20
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:51,060
"Don't be apprehensive. I love you, so trust in me..."

21
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,190
Oh no.

22
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,280
I ended up confessing my feelings.

23
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,670
Oh my, oh my, no.

24
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,250
My mouth, my mouth did it again, suddenly.

25
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,160
Oh, you already know I'm not completely in my right mind.

26
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,430
What's that? You are too much.

27
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,900
Why do you nod your head like that?

28
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,170
You are too much.

29
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,630
Where are you going?

30
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,790
Hurry and follow me.

31
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:45,350
Hurry?

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,080
I thought about you many times, Teacher, but I couldn't come to see you.

33
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,700
I wanted to show you that I was living a good life, so I'm sorry about this.

34
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,480
But wasn't your dream always to become a firefighter?

35
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,350
You realized your dream, that's enough.

36
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,250
You've succeeded.

37
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,520
No, I think it was the wrong choice from the beginning.

38
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,960
Back then, 23 years ago,

39
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,190
the truth is... it wasn't me that hugged you.

40
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,670
You kids are the ones who hugged me.

41
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:33,730
At that time, I had lost my son, my only child.

42
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,830
I had no idea, you were always smiling at us.

43
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,670
There was no need for me to be sad in front of you kids.

44
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,370
Just seeing you kids gave me strength, as if my son had come back to life.

45
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,890
And among all the kids, I was the most grateful for you.

46
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,660
You always comforted me twice.

47
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,030
So you do remember.

48
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:09,150
I was going through a lot of tough things too, back then.

49
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,200
Whenever things got hard, I'd think...

50
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,180
Having survived losing my child, what couldn't I endure?

51
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,830
I can endure anything.

52
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,860
The fact that you're in a difficult time now

53
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:28,710
just means you will be able to endure hardships in the future.

54
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,750
Isn't that what trauma is?

55
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,530
Yes, I will overcome this.

56
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:40,660
Our Hong Min, you were always such a nice kid, and you haven't changed at all.

57
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,620
And you've become more handsome. I think you'll probably get married again.

58
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:55,280
I'm very happy that I'm able to see you again like this.

59
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,640
When that teacher embraced Baek Hong Min,

60
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,520
I felt a bit weird.

61
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,840
Yeah, I almost cried.

62
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,890
There is no one without trauma, so it seems everyone received comfort.

63
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,940
I was an outcast in middle school, that's my trauma.

64
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,280
You're still an outcast.

65
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,010
Looks like you never got over it.

66
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,420
Wow, don't do that! Really.

67
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,640
Hey, I still can't ride the subway.

68
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,850
But I'm fine, I'm getting better, little by little.

69
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,970
But Woo Jung sunbae, how did that teacher come here?

70
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,620
Well, shall I say it's thanks to Han Woo Joo?

71
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,830
What does that mean?

72
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:39,370
There's a new "comforting" therapeutic treatment, and it came about because of Han Woo Joo's idea.

73
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,470
I really regret that she quit her position.

74
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,180
But we can still see her when we come to Kong Rice House.

75
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,160
Isn't that right, Owner? We can see her if we come here?

76
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,590
I'm not sure about that, actually.

77
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,690
- We ate well.
 - We ate well.

78
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,410
Goodbye.

79
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,170
We ate well, thank you.

80
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,290
What about Unni Woo Joo?

81
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,750
Why are you curious about her? I don't know either.

82
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,220
I'm on the overnight shift at the ER, I won't be home.

83
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,050
Work hard.

84
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,880
That hurts a lot, doesn't it? Since you are sleeping, I'll loosen this for you.

85
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,660
You must not move.

86
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,570
When did this become loose?

87
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,780
Please calm down, please calm down.

88
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,100
I loosened it a little because she had a bad bruise on her wrist.

89
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,480
Nurse Heo, do you have a thought in your head?

90
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,020
This patient is delirious! What if she had pulled out her ventilator?

91
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,770
I'm sorry.

92
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,700
What's wrong with you these days? You've been at this job for three years, how are you worse than the new hires?

93
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,600
You couldn't even take out a catheter line last time.

94
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,080
Stop it, the patients can hear all this.

95
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,720
This is why you killed a patient.

96
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,790
Nurse Heo?

97
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,550
Heo Min Yeong?

98
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,040
Why are you so spaced out?

99
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,970
What happened? Do you have something you want to talk about?

100
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:11,460
Just thought of you on my way home, that's all.

101
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,380
Are you not well? Your expression looks dark.

102
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,140
I just feel a bit down.

103
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,230
But why? You've been like that lately.

104
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,630
Has something bad happened?

105
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,020
Do the older doctors mistreat you?

106
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,160
No.

107
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,420
I'm not sure myself.

108
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:40,190
I just feel like I'm sinking into the ground all the time.

109
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,610
I feel like I've disappeared.

110
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,860
Go on in. I feel better after having seen your face.

111
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,810
Are you really alright?

112
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,390
I'm sure I'll feel better soon.

113
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:56,400
I would ask you to have a drink if I didn't have work.

114
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,360
I'll be going now.

115
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,680
It was the Chief who fired Woo Joo.

116
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,290
I guess he's worried about Si Joon.

117
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,410
Do you know about Si Joon's relationship with Woo Joo?

118
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,000
I do. I've known for a while now.

119
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,880
I heard it directly from Si Joon.

120
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,060
Last time, I confessed my feelings to Si Joon.

121
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,310
Looks like I missed the right timing again.

122
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:05,710
But gratefully, Si Joon already knew how I felt about him.

123
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,530
Why are you grateful for that?

124
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,700
For understanding how I felt.

125
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,860
Because I never understood how you felt.

126
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,390
So I was sorry.

127
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,210
But confessing my feelings did unburden my heart.

128
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,700
So I was able to cleanly get over it.

129
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,130
You don't have to feel sorry to me.

130
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,950
- But still...
 - Because I intend to begin again, starting now.

131
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,050
- Huh?
 - You said you got cleanly over it.

132
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,830
So that means I'm allowed to start liking you again, right?

133
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,070
Messages: Patient Heo Min Yeong

134
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,180
The call was not connected, so at the beep...

135
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:15,010
- Who is that?
 - A patient who I treated.

136
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:18,230
She sometimes sends me these messages full of bitterness.

137
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,160
And when I call her back out of worry, she avoids my calls.

138
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,980
But what does she have against you?

139
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,700
She's angry at me.

140
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,170
I'm sure she'll get over it soon.

141
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,850
Ji Young Won, you know you shouldn't just leave patients who do this alone, right?

142
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:34,310
If something happens, make sure to contact me right away.

143
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,400
Okay, sure.

144
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:58,550
Why are you on the phone so much? Is something going on?

145
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,830
You know Nurse Heo Min Yeong? She works with me in the ICU?

146
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,220
Yes, what about her?

147
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,300
I met her briefly earlier tonight,

148
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,480
but she seemed a bit unsettled. Why won't she answer her phone?

149
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,060
It's so late, I'm sure she's sleeping by now.

150
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,260
Right? She must be sleeping, huh?

151
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,440
Of course.

152
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,870

153
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,390

154
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:54,700
This is the result of the functional MRI we took this morning of Patient Baek Hong Min.

155
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,720
His neural functions have changed a lot since the last time we examined him.

156
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,520
The "comforting" technique had good effect.

157
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,880
What's that?

158
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,820
Yes, I tried naming the method.

159
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,280
It's a form of "safety zone technique."

160
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,830
I plan to not use group therapy in the future for PTSD patients.

161
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:15,890
But I plan on trying using this method for other PTSD patients as well.

162
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,970
How about using this as a research subject?

163
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,840
I was thinking that, too.

164
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,120
Alright, so anyone who wants to participate in this research?

165
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,950
I will pick two.

166
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,370
- Me! 
 - Me!
 - Me!
 - Me!

167
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,120
Kong Ji Hee, Jang Yoo Mi, you are the winners.

168
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,420
Yes, this is Park Dae Ha.

169
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,630
The police station?

170
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,900
Ah, yes, I understand.

171
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,150

172
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:19,120
Does anyone know why the deceased made such an extreme choice?

173
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,830
The person who received a text message from her two days ago?

174
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,990
- Her name is Na Seong Gyeong.
 - That's me.

175
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,640
Text message? What text message?

176
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,670
Grandpa Choi Soon Nam makes a noise when his adult diaper is uncomfortable

177
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,650
so please change him.

178
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:40,920
And Lee Ji Yeong gets a lot of phlegm, so we have to extract it often.

179
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,640
Please take good care of these two patients.

180
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,380
After seeing this message, didn't you find it strange?

181
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,610
Well, I just assumed that she was preparing to quit her job.

182
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:55,000
There are a lot of nurses here who quit because the work is difficult.

183
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,560
What was your relationship with her like?

184
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,020
Just... senior and junior at work, of course.

185
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,120
 Intensive Care Unit

186
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,040
Cha Dong Il.

187
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,710
I am Cha Dong Il, Trainee of Shinsa Police Station, I greet you.

188
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,660
What are you doing here?

189
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,830
Trainee? I'm going crazy.

190
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,020
What I told you...

191
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,620
Will you disappoint me like this?

192
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,120
- Come here, before anyone sees you...
 - Uh, but...

193
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,820
I'm here to investigate a death.

194
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,290
A death? This boy, really... ?

195
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:11,280
I passed the police officer exam.

196
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,020
- What?
 - I began training today.

197
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,590
I was planning to come say hello to you anyway.

198
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:23,680
But it turned out that I came here on my first day as a trainee. I was shocked, too.

199
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,000

200
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:40,070
- Really?
 - I really am a police officer now.

201
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,860
You did well.

202
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:50,030
Are you crying, by any chance?

203
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,980
Wow.

204
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,720
- You've become a real hero now.
 - It's all thanks to you, Doctor.

205
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,690
Of course, I took you out on training sessions every day.

206
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:07,270
From now on, I will protect you, Doctor.

207
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,880
Wow. Oh, right. So what case is this?

208
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,460
A nurse in the ICU at this hospital was discovered dead early this morning.

209
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,120

210
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,600
Nurse Heo was one of my patients.

211
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,550
She suffered from depression for a long time.

212
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:34,360
Based on what I saw, she was harassed a lot at the hospital.

213
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,700
Well, yes.

214
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,440
You spoke to her on the phone often recently.

215
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,810
The ICU is very busy,

216
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,770
so there wasn't time to see her often, so I spoke to her often on the phone.

217
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:50,360
I see. Do you know who Ji Young Won is?

218
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,580
- Psychiatrist Ji Young Won?
 - Yes.

219
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,510
Yes, I know her well. But why do ask about her?

220
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:59,400
There were some things about Ji Young Won in her suicide note.

221
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,880
- What things?
 - I can't tell you the specifics.

222
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,170
I am the one who introduced Nurse Heo to Dr. Ji Young Won.

223
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:11,000
I have an idea what the note might say, so please tell me.

224
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,020
Cha Dong Il, he's here.

225
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,190
I am Cha Dong Il, Trainee of Shinsa Police Station, I greet you.

226
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,320
Cha Dong Il.

227
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,510
Wow, it's really you, Cha Dong Il.

228
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:26,670
Cha Dong Il, congratulations. I never knew you would come to greet us after becoming a real police officer.

229
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:30,280
- He didn't come to greet us. He's here on an investigation.
 - Investigation?

230
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,620
There is a death, so I came to investigate.

231
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,310
What death?

232
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:38,260
Detectives are working on the case, so you'll find out soon.

233
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,310
I think I'd better be on my way.

234
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,470
Oh, so you're leaving like this right now?

235
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,120
I'm on duty right now.

236
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,790
When do you get off work? Let's have a meal together later.

237
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:53,680
Then I will contact you later.

238
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,840
I will get going now.

239
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,520
Who are they?

240
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,040
Wow, Ji sunbae,

241
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,370
can a delusional patient become that normal?

242
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,560
Can't you see with your own eyes?

243
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,520
Wow, it suits him well.

244
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,850
Yes?

245
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,330
Nurse Heo had persistent depressive disorder.

246
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,820
So she must have been your patient for a long time.

247
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,630
No.

248
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:32,350
- She had been receiving treatment from Ji Young Won.
 - Young Won?

249
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:37,070
She said she didn't want to be seen receiving treatment at our hospital.

250
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,980
So I referred her.

251
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,610
She was my patient for only about a month.

252
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,220
But why did she come back to you?

253
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:50,520
I didn't think too much about it at the time, but it turns out, there was a reason.

254
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,320
Nurse Heo mentioned Young Won in her suicide note.

255
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,760
What?

256
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:04,070
I don't know the details, but her survivors

257
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,460
intend to file a civil suit against Young Won.

258
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,110
What?

259
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:12,090
Looks like she's getting blamed. But what can we do?

260
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,350
Someone just died.

261
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:18,620
And she took her own life at that. But they want to file a civil suit right away?

262
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,580
Can you look into Young Won a bit? See if anything is going on?

263
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,830
I understand. I will try speaking with her on the phone.

264
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:33,520
She seemed really low the last few days, and now suddenly this.

265
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,450
Don't drink alone because you feel upset.

266
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,850
You take care of yourself please.

267
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,920
I think I will have to cancel all my appointments for today.

268
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,020
Please tell them I'm sorry and reschedule them, please.

269
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:01,160
Why would a young person make such an extreme choice?

270
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:05,350
Chief Park, this nurse was "burned," wasn't she?

271
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:08,330
"Burned?" What does that mean, exactly?

272
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:13,750
"Burned," it's a slang word used among the nurses.

273
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,110
It's workplace harassment.

274
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,510
Do you know who did that to her, by any chance?

275
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,830
If you find out, what do you intend to do?

276
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:24,230
From the hospital's perspective, we must ask her to take responsibility.

277
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,010
Nurse Heo was suffering from depression.

278
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:30,350
But wasn't the source of the depression the "burning" incidents?

279
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,690
But the problem isn't about just one or two people, is it?

280
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:36,180
How can you find a perpetrator and ask her to take responsibility?

281
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:41,720
This particular incident happened among the ICU nurses

282
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,200
but I'm sure it's similar in other departments as well.

283
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,270
Chief Park? This "burning,"

284
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:53,790
is not a problem with the people, but with the hospital system? Is that what you want to say?

285
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:56,400
The fundamental reason that these things happen

286
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,820
is due to staff shortage, you know that well, Director.

287
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:04,940
So the hospital should take responsibility for Nurse Heo's death?

288
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,260
- Is that what you are saying?
 - Yes, that is my opinion.

289
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:16,420
Of course, condolences for the deceased comes first. But I hope that we use this opportunity for reorganizing the system.

290
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:22,400
Nurses requested increase in staff many times, but the hospital did not listen. This is a fact.

291
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,130
Chief Park Dae Ha, please leave now.

292
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,790
- What?
 - Get out of this room, please.

293
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:52,310
Vice President, firstly, in order for our hospital not to be talked about in the media,

294
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:56,050
I will do what I can. But I think it will become known, eventually.

295
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:59,090
During that time, please find the perpetrator, Vice President.

296
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,330
I understand.

297
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:04,070
You do realize that this is serious matter, this time?

298
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,260
Of course I do.

299
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:19,230
Chief, I became the Preceptor.

300
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:21,480

301
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,500
- Are you that happy about it?
 - Of course.

302
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,310
I will be so nice to the new nurses.

303
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:30,440
I will teach them everything with such kindness.

304
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,260
Whoever these new nurses are, they are blessed.

305
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:37,650
To learn from such a great sunbae like you, Nurse Heo.

306
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,460
Are you still doing this?

307
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,270
The patients will get worried if they see you this way.

308
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,360
I'm sorry.

309
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,310
But my tears just won't stop.

310
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:24,780
In her will, she wrote that if her body is discovered, to make sure the funeral wasn't held at our hospital.

311
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:28,980
And also not to let anyone from the hospital attend.

312
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,790
How far gone must she have been to write something like that?

313
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:36,100
But why did she always smile, like nothing was wrong?

314
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,430
I feel terrible for her, really.

315
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,300
I can't take this patient.

316
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,990
You saw two of my patients had cardiac arrests at the same time and everything was chaotic!

317
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:52,040
If you give me another patient that needs such close monitoring... do you want me to die too?

318
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,400
I don't want to do this, either, but do you realize how much I have to do?

319
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,890
Just deal with it until we get increased staff.

320
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:00,770
Since Nurse Heo left us like that, our month's duties are messed up.

321
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:04,420
She torments us even in death.

322
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,940
What brings you here?

323
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,650
I came to pick up Nurse Heo's things.

324
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:11,310
I'll show you where it is.

325
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,790
Looks like your duty schedule is messed up?

326
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:17,990
It's driving us crazy. And quite a few are on breaks, or pregnant. It's a real mess.

327
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:22,090
But no matter what, someone died. Must you speak of her like that?

328
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:26,370
This is the ICU. We don't have time to go to the restroom, and no time to feel sad. It's chaos in here.

329
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,400
Nurse Na, how can you speak that way?

330
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,850
Don't you know Nurse Oh Hwa Young?

331
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:32,570
She's your senior by quite a lot. I'm sorry.

332
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,940
It's fine. Who am I, anyway?

333
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,400
Looks like Nurse Heo had some hard times because of you.

334
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,290
And I had hard times because of her.

335
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:45,020
Can't you live your life a little more kindly?

336
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:49,360
Everyone work hard.

337
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:59,050
I can't sleep well at night these days.

338
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:02,270
- Why not?
 - Thinking about you all night.

339
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:07,990
Do you feel burdened because I'm too honest?

340
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,820
No.

341
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,700
Doctor,

342
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:22,240
deep in my heart there is a place that is always dark.

343
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,320
It's not just regular darkness. A dark cloud? Like that?

344
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,060
What kind of emotion do you think that is?

345
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,690
Uneasiness.

346
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,790
So you always have uneasiness in your heart?

347
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:37,880
Dr. Ji Young Won said that my uneasiness began with my mom.

348
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,440
So I thought about it.

349
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,410
How can I get rid of this uneasiness?

350
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,360
And then?

351
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:52,010
If I meet my mom, will my uneasiness disappear?

352
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:55,470
You've never thought about looking for your mom?

353
00:29:55,470 --> 00:30:00,400
Of course I did. But I couldn't bring myself to do it, because I was scared.

354
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,090
What were you scared of?

355
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:06,110
That the reason she abandoned me is something appalling.

356
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:13,560
Then the little bit of good feelings I still have for my mom would disappear.

357
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:21,660
If I meet my mom, will this fundamental uneasiness I have disappear?

358
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:26,550
I don't think you will escape the uneasiness just by meeting your mom.

359
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:32,700
The reason is that you've lived all this time thinking about how you were abandoned.

360
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,850
So everything will not be forgiven just because you meet your mom.

361
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:44,830
Then must I live for the rest of my life, always uneasy about how I might be abandoned?

362
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,490
I ruin all my relationships because of these feelings.

363
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:49,830
But that won't happen this time.

364
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,130
How can you be sure?

365
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:54,950
Because I know better than anyone what your status is.

366
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:59,030
Just like last time, I will wait for you.

367
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:03,980
And if you get exhausted? Love is not forever, they say.

368
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:09,220
What lasts forever in this world? And what a fortunate thing that is.

369
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:13,750
That means that you too can change, Woo Joo.

370
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:17,800
You know Cha Dong Il, don't you?

371
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,950
How can I forget him? The fake policeman?

372
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:24,120
Dong Il became a real policeman.

373
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,400
A real policeman?

374
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,570
It's an amazing change.

375
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:32,480
I trusted in him.

376
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,550
As a doctor, I believe in you.

377
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:38,060
Because you will change for sure.

378
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,600
I think I will get a new part-time job soon.

379
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,670
- What kind of job?
 - To help high school seniors pass their entrance exams.

380
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:47,740
Teach them how to sing and act.

381
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,690
Good for you.

382
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:54,680
Oh right. They're opening the new psychiatry clinic soon.

383
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,950
Yes.

384
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:59,760
I think it will be good if you do something with the patients on opening day.

385
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,850
What should I do with the patients?

386
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:04,830
How about a play?

387
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:13,280
A play with the patients... ? I don't think that will be easy.

388
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,730
Maybe a chorus?

389
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:16,860
Chorus?

390
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,050
That sounds good. Yes, great.

391
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:24,280
Then, I'd better think about this a bit.

392
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,680
I'm quite busy, as you know.
