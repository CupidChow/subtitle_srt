00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,360

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,510
Good work today.

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,740
You too, Doctor.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,850
Oh, wait a minute.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:22,190

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,910
I bought this earlier and meant to give it to you, but never got the chance.

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,370
If you don't like it, you can just throw it away.

8
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,320
Can you put it on for me?

9
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,770
♫  The endlessly dark evening road is narrow and far.  ♫

10
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:54,460
♫  When you don't know where to go,  ♫

11
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,490
Head in.

12
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,450
♫  I'll be there for you,  ♫

13
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,920
♫  on the corner of the road.   ♫

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:09,600
♫  It'll all be okay, so don't worry.  ♫

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,270
♫  I love you.  ♫

16
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,270
Thank you.

17
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,910
I... 
 ♫  I always have.  ♫

18
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,320
♫  Waiting for you, like this.  ♫

19
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,430
Thank you for the gift.

20
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,760
It's not a present,

21
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,950
but... um... a type of bandage.

22
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,050
Don't put any meaning behind it.

23
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,390
It's just a bandage I put on you because I kept seeing your scar.

24
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,860
Thank you for the bandage gift.

25
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,660
♫  When I think of you, it gets better.  ♫

26
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:59,840
♫  In the unknown days and nights that are far away,   ♫

27
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,170
♫  we can be each other's courage.  ♫

28
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,940
Why is he running?

29
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,420
♫  Let's walk together.   ♫

30
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,860
He must be really shy.

31
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,540
♫  Let's walk together.   ♫

32
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,960
Maybe it's because I confessed all my pathetic thoughts, but I feel so refreshed.

33
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,100
Not me.

34
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:45,340
I haven't talked about my life's most pathetic aspect yet.

35
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,110
What is it?

36
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:55,680
I still haven't been able to tell the person I like that I like them.

37
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:03,660
That's why I'm telling you. Confess, if you don't want to become a loser like me.

38
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:08,010
Now, I've just become your most comfortable friend, but you're not like that yet.

39
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,940
It's not late for you.

40
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,900
Were you exercising?

41
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,440
What's the occasion?

42
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,660
I actually like to exercise regularly.

43
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:45,810
You really don't know a thing about me, do you?

44
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,800
I heard Ms. Woo Joo started theatrical treatment again. You made the right decision.

45
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,060
It wasn't so much for Ms. Woo Joo, but because I needed help.

46
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,300
Ms. Woo Joo is the best at drawing out the inner thoughts of the patients.

47
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,880
You don't need to draw boundaries like that.

48
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,920
Even without theatrical treatment, for whatever reason, you would've met her again.

49
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,080
It's just earlier than you anticipated.

50
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:17,740
I think that Ms. Woo Joo is developing transference towards me.

51
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,040
The transference seems to be very positive.

52
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,190
I think she's been leaning on you a lot.

53
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,850
I should be the one to set the boundaries, right?

54
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,030
Just act naturally, like normal.

55
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,790
Or you can start psychological treatments right away.

56
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:37,430
Then she'll know that her emotions aren't real.

57
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,780
Can you... help me?

58
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:45,770
Why do you think I introduced you to Ms. Woo Joo, out of all the other BPD patients I've had before?

59
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,130
Ms. Woo Joo is different from Jung Se Yeon.

60
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,270
Don't avoid it and don't set boundaries. Confront it, for your benefit.

61
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,790
Wow, Ji Young Won. You really are my primary doctor.

62
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,450
I don't want to be your primary doctor.

63
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,050
Good friends are all good psychiatrists.

64
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,980
They listen to you and take your side.

65
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,350
I don't want to be your friend, either.

66
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,090
Then what?

67
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,300
It's nothing.

68
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,550
It's transference.

69
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,750
It's not real, but transference.

70
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,940
 I had another dream about a fire.

71
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,970
- Can we switch plates once?
- No way.

72
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,400
Just switch with me once!

73
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,240
I've already switched with you twice.

74
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,170
Didn't Dr. Lee come with you?

75
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:25,480
He probably won't be able to eat lunch today. He seemed really busy.

76
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,010
He doesn't even have time to eat?

77
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,880
Nope.

78
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,130
Eat up.

79
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,340
Yes, thank you.

80
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,380
- Eat up, Ji Hee.  
 - Thanks.

81
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,540
Cut that out.

82
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,340
Dr. Noh, you like fried eggs, right?

83
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,970
Yes. How did you know?

84
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,260
- Eat up. 
 - Thank you.

85
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,670
Unnie, cut what out?

86
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,280
That was directed at Woo Joo. Just eat.

87
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,160
Doctors are really dense.

88
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,960
Get up.

89
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,830
Do you like it that much?

90
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,890
Do you know what this bracelet's name is?

91
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:17,390
Aigoo, you've already named it?

92
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,190
Bandage.

93
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,400
This is Congressman Koh Sang Mo. Introduce yourself.

94
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,190
Hello. I'm Lee Si Joon.

95
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,410
I'm Koh Sang Mo.

96
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:01,420
I'm sure you've seen many people like me, so this isn't very surprising to you.

97
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,860
Since when have you been like this?

98
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,210
Since last night.

99
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,190
This is the first reoccurrence since he was 9 years old.

100
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,820
It did come back a few times,

101
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,130
when I was working as a lawyer before becoming a congressman.

102
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,620
Then, it went away pretty quickly.

103
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:22,310
I think it may be because you're stressed about the hearing.

104
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,920
Would it be possible to fix it before the hearing?

105
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,730
- A full recovery will be difficult,  
 - Dr. Lee.

106
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,560
but we can use medication to stop the symptoms.

107
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,120
Judging from how something like this happened before the hearing,

108
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,810
I wonder if it's a sign from the heavens to know my place.

109
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,380
Aigoo! What do you mean?

110
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,310
Congressman Koh, you've worked your whole life fighting for the rights of laborers.

111
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,820
You can't give up because of something like this.

112
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,090
We will try our very best

113
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,670
to ensure that you are able to go out to that hearing.

114
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,210
Can you explain what happened before your symptoms appeared?

115
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,400
Let's see.

116
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,530
 You've worked hard.

117
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,170
 Thanks to you, the first case has been resolved well.

118
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,880
 Now, let's work hard in preparation for the next case.

119
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,800
 Good work.

120
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,480
 Sir, are you okay?

121
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,200
 Name, Koh Sang Mo. A tic disorder patient.

122
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,640
The first occurrence was when he was 9 years old, and the symptoms appeared a few times in his adult years.

123
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,690
He says, however, the symptoms did not continue and usually got better on their own.

124
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,020
By Congressman Koh Sang Mo, do you mean...

125
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:52,900
You're right. The candidate for the Ministry of Employment and Labor, who has the upcoming hearing.

126
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,340
So we have to make sure he has recovered before the hearing?

127
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,140
There isn't much time left until the hearing.

128
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,490
What treatment would be best?

129
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:03,250
Tics are most closely associated with the dopamine releasing neurotransmitter systems.

130
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,630
I think that dopamine-related medicinal treatment along with habit reversal treatment would work.

131
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:12,060
This isn't typical, but... I think we could also try biofeedback therapy along with that.

132
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,460
I think he must be facing a lot of mental burdens with the upcoming hearing.

133
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,470
I believe it's most important to use a psychological assessment to determine the origin of this stress.

134
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:22,220
Since we don't have much time, I think we better start all treatments at once.

135
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,910
I agree. From now, No Wu Jeong and Kong Ji Hee, you two start looking into the neurotransmitter connections of the patient.

136
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,830
Kang Nu Ri and Im Se Chan, you two start researching what needs to be done for a psychological assessment.

137
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:33,730
- Okay. 
 - I can't work with Im Se Chan.

138
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,180
Do you like glancing at me like that?

139
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,640
What?

140
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,930
You kept glancing over at me.

141
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,490
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

142
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,290
Sunbae, you've got it wrong!

143
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,430
Disgusting.

144
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,740
Wait, wait— Sunbae!

145
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:59,320
- Why is she being like that? 
 - Dr. In, check in on Kang Nu Ri's condition.

146
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,980
Yes, sir.|

147
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,120
What are you doing? Why are you taking pictures of other people?

148
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,410
I didn't take any pictures of you.

149
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,440
What do you mean, you didn't? I saw it all.

150
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,720
What are you doing? I really didn't take any pictures.

151
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,840
Kang Nu Ri, what's going on? Did something happen?

152
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,640
Dr. In, this man took pictures of me with his phone.

153
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,170
I'm telling you, I saw it.

154
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,980
I'm telling you I didn't. Look! I didn't take any pictures.

155
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:50,610
You must've hid it somewhere. You probably hid it so other people can't see it!

156
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,980
What are you doing?

157
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,730
I think I'm going more and more crazy.

158
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:08,460
I think everyone in the world has seen my pictures,

159
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,390
and they're looking at me.

160
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,790
I keep looking to see if my pictures might still be somewhere out there.

161
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,020
I keep regretting everything.

162
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,950
Why did I have to go on the subway and get my picture taken?

163
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,740
I should've not saved money and taken a taxi instead.

164
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:32,270
Nu Ri, getting your photo taken isn't your fault.

165
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,390
That's just... something like an accident.

166
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,290
I want revenge

167
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,130
on the person that posted those pictures of me.

168
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,230
That person is already getting punished.

169
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:50,120
He got caught and punished for running around the park naked, and he can't be a doctor anymore.

170
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,410
What do you think about taking a few days off?

171
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,780
My neck won't break because of this, right?

172
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,560
Don't worry about it. It's your muscles that are moving.

173
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,770
I see.

174
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:25,560
First, I will name your tic.

175
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,620
Name it?

176
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,490
So you can get closer to your symptoms.

177
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,540
That's interesting.

178
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,050
What are you going to name it?

179
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:38,310
I think it'd be best if it was a word most familiar to you.

180
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:43,650
Hmm... What if we named your tic 'Citizens of our nation?'

181
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,180
That's the phrase that congressmen use the most.

182
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,360
Citizens of our nation?

183
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,560
Sounds good.

184
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,780
Okay, then from now on, we are going to call your tic symptoms 'Citizens of our nation.'

185
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:01,130
Are there any precursors you experience before Citizens of our nation come to you?

186
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:06,230
For example, maybe your neck starts to feel a bit heavy or sore?

187
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,380
When my neck is about to move,

188
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:13,590
it feels a bit tingly or stiff.

189
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,810
I feel like I can't resist moving it.

190
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:19,390
Yes, okay. Every time Citizens of our nation come to you,

191
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:24,460
this may be difficult, but try to tense your muscles on the opposite side.

192
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:29,910
The thing to keep in mind is that every time Citizens of our nation come to you, you have to shout their name.

193
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,950
Citizens of our nation!

194
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,370
Like this.

195
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:38,260
You're not joking around, are you?

196
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:43,720
This is HRT or Habit Reversal Training.

197
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,840
It's been the center of focus when treating tic symptoms.

198
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,700
It's a type of training where you tense up the muscles unrelated to your tic symptoms,

199
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,260
and resist the urge to let your tic symptoms be displayed.

200
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,870
I see.

201
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,680
I'll show you another demonstration.

202
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,430
Okay. The precursor symptoms are coming...

203
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:05,100
'Citizens of our nation' and pull your chin.

204
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,300
Okay. Now it's your turn.

205
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,460
Citizens of ou-our nat...

206
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:18,650
You have to have confidence. Louder! One more time.

207
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,390
Citizens of our nation!

208
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:27,000
Exactly like that! Good job!

209
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,150
Shall we try one more time?

210
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,920
Citizens of our nation!

211
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,720
That was a bit weaker than before... 
  The key in habit reversal training

212
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,530
 is recognizing the sensations of the precursors.

213
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,260
Citizens of our nation!

214
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:50,350
 Thus, the patients must become sensitive to the sensations that occur before the tic symptoms occur.

215
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,940
One last time?

216
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:57,020
 For patients with tic disorder, it's important to ensure that there is no underlying neurological disorder, such as Huntington's disease.

217
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:03,020
 In patient Koh Sang Mo's case, no anomalies were found in his nerves or EEG.

218
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,750
 Then the stresses that worsen his conditions

219
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,660
 must come mostly from some mental origins.

220
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:15,660
 What disturbed his sleeping tic?

221
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,430

222
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,700

223
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,200
 The person you are trying to call...  
 Why isn't he picking up?

224
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,240
Do you think someone who couldn't even eat lunch because he was so busy has time to take a phone call?

225
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,510
I only see Ji Hee when she comes to eat lunch too.

226
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:52,290
Then I better just go.

227
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,580
- Where are you going? 
 - I told you it's my mom's birthday today.

228
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,300
What mom?

229
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,880
Your adoptive mother who runs a chicken shop?

230
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,260
Do you still take care of them?

231
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,090
I didn't care for them that much.

232
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,790
They're people who filed for dissolution of your adoption!

233
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,550
Even after that, your adoptive father—

234
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,730
- How much money did he take from you? 
 - Don't curse at them.

235
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,580
They raised me for 6 years!

236
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,810
The only person who brought me a bouquet of flowers at my elementary school graduation was my adoptive father.

237
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:20,960
I have to visit them often so they'll forgive me.

238
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,900
I had another  dream about the fire.

239
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,440
It shows up in your dreams because you can't forget about it.

240
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,870
What should I buy my mom for her birthday?

241
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,310
Your mom's birthday present?

242
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:41,040
I'll package you some trash. Go take that to her.

243
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,430
You're horrible.

244
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,660
You're an idiot!

245
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:56,070
They put it out for sale even though the contract term wasn't over yet.

246
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,800
It hasn't even been 3 weeks since I've taken over.

247
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,110
Do you really not know where they went?

248
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,960
How many times do I have to tell you?

249
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,300
I didn't even get to see what the previous owners looked like.

250
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:14,250
 The person you are trying to call...

251
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:31,190
 The person you are trying to call...

252
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,570
 The person you are trying to call...

253
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,030
 The person you are trying to call...

254
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:57,190
- What is it? 
 - Mom!

255
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,150
Mom, why did you move your shop without even telling me?

256
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,920
Did something bad happen?

257
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:09,830
It's your birthday today. Can I just give you your gift and leave?

258
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,150
How can you do this?

259
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,000
This is the only place I could see you!

260
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,470
What am I supposed to do if you leave like this?

261
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,900
If you run away, do you think I won't be able to find you?

262
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,730
I'm going to find you no matter what!

263
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,850
Mo-Mom...

264
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,630
Mom!

265
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,870
One...

266
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,090
Four.

267
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,840
Five.

268
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,290
Apparently he almost never slept, preparing for the hearing.

269
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:13,620
On top of that, he was dealing with issues of rehiring dismissed laborers, creating programs to support laborers.

270
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,330
He was even preparing a debate for platform laborers.

271
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:21,410
Congressman Koh usually rides the subway.

272
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,010
- The subway? 
  - Yes.

273
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,960
He's been involved in improving conditions for conductors for Seoul's subway.

274
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,380
He said even if you cut a congressman's salary in half,

275
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,920
it's still 3 times the average salary of a laborer in our country.

276
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,280
He gave gifts to those who work as janitors in the National Assembly.

277
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,000
Wow! You're a fan of Congressman Koh, aren't you?

278
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,270
Dr. Lee, I think someone like him deserves to become the Minister of Employment and Labor.

279
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,400
I want to help him so that he can appear at the hearing no matter what.

280
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,550
He's getting HRT, so keep checking back on him.

281
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,210
Keep it to 50 reps per visit.

282
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,540
Okay, I'll do that.

283
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,320

284
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:10,390
You must've been really busy. I kept calling you earlier, too.

285
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,470
Yes. I was quite busy today.

286
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:16,390
This must be why you don't have a girlfriend.

287
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,610
Why did you call?

288
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:23,350
Dr. Lee, look at the sky.

289
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,940
The full moon is up.

290
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:30,270
We're apart, but we can see the same moon.

291
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:33,320
I'm sorry, but I don't have time to look at the moon.

292
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,180
I'll go to the hospital right now.

293
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,240
Why? Did something happen?

294
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,200
Our relationship allows for more than just meeting when something happened.

295
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,040
There used to be a chicken shop that I liked,

296
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,040
but the owner suddenly changed.

297
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,140
They moved without even telling me.

298
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,970
 How can they do that?

299
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,420
Are you... crying?

300
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,280
I'm just so upset.

301
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,610
So, so much.

302
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,240
Are you crying because the chicken shop is gone?

303
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,970
No, this isn't just ordinary chicken!

304
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:17,270
There are so many chicken shops here. There must be another good one somewhere.

305
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,980
 No, there will be none like this one!

306
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,780
 I'll explain it to you in person,

307
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,870
what kind of place this is. I'll head over.

308
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,530
I don't have time to listen to your story about chicken. I don't even like chicken.

309
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,880
Do you think I'm being like this because of chicken?

310
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,480
Then what's the problem?

311
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,540
Forget it. I don't need it.

312
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,560
What's wrong with her? I'm so flustered.

313
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:01,070
Is it not really because of chicken?

314
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,560
- Where are you? 
 - Were you waiting for a call?

315
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,400
Oh, it's Young Won.

316
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,190
What brings you to the hospital?

317
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,450
I just suddenly wanted a cup of coffee with you.

318
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,170
Wow! Today it will be coffee instead of a meal.

319
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,710
Did you not eat dinner?

320
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,000
You have something to tell me, huh?

321
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,340
- Oh, you're psychic. 
 - Is it about Ms. Woo Joo?

322
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,760
Why? Did something happen to her?

323
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,740
I'm the problem.

324
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,980
Because of the transference, I can't act naturally.

325
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:48,070
I keep avoiding her calls and act cold when I pick up.

326
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,610
I'm being more sensitive.

327
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:55,380
You're a patient too,  in front of BPD patients. A PTSD patient.

328
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:00,660
Take your time. Nobody is rushing you.

329
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,810
You had something to tell me?

330
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:15,280
8 years ago... to be honest, I knew.

331
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:22,550
I knew Jung Se Yeon might die, but I didn't tell you.

332
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,850
The reason I'm telling you this now

333
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:30,270
isn't because I want to apologize and ask for your forgiveness,

334
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:33,760
but because I want to tell you why I did that.

335
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,610
Why are you smiling?

336
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,950
You idiot!

337
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:52,650
You must've been struggling with that internally, all this time.

338
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:55,510
If you had told me,

339
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:01,380
do you think Se Yeon's death could have been prevented?

340
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,920
No.

341
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,850
Se Yeon would have used any means

342
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:12,350
to do that in front of me.

343
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:15,840
Her intent was to punish me.

344
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,940
Don't you want to know why I did that?

345
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,880
Nope. I'm not curious.

346
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,880
I'm hungry. Let's go eat somewhere.

347
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:40,730
Why isn't she back yet? And not calling?

348
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:45,750
She's not a friend, but a child. A 17-year-old child.

349
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,730
- Dr. Lee! Are you here to eat? 
 - Do you have some rice?

350
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,250
Yes, I do. Have a seat.

351
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:57,210
Hello. I've heard a lot about you from Ms. Woo Joo.

352
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,020
I'm Ji Young Won.

353
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,180
Nice to meet you.

354
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,220
Thank you.

355
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:07,530
By the way, did something happen to Ms. Woo Joo today?

356
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,410
No, nothing happened.

357
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:12,960
Woo Joo's been bragging about the bracelet you gave her all day.

358
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,200
That really isn't much.

359
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,350
- Dr. Lee, did you speak to Woo Joo? 
 - Yes, a little while ago.

360
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:22,890
- She was angry because she went to a chicken shop and the owner had changed. 
 - What?

361
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,740
Ms. Woo Joo must really like chicken.

362
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,600
Enjoy your meal.

363
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,010
You gifted Ms. Woo Joo a bracelet?

364
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:40,520
It wasn't much of a gift.

365
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,470
More like... a bandage. She has a scar on her wrist.

366
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:51,440
Young Won. You have to keep it a secret from Ms. Woo Joo that you introduced her to me.

367
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,750
She probably thinks it was a coincidence.

368
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:58,270
Why are you worrying about such things? I'm a doctor too, you know.

369
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,020
Eat up.

370
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:20,400
 The bus will be arriving shortly.

371
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,390

372
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,970

373
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:48,330
Can you guys find people as well?

374
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:55,110
 You gifted Ms. Woo Joo a bracelet?

375
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,730
 It wasn't much of a gift.

376
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:01,580
 More like... a bandage. She has a scar on her wrist.

377
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:41,090
Who is it, at this time?

378
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,770
What are you doing?

379
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:50,700
Didn't you hear about the regulations from the attending?

380
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,140
Do you think that your tic will continue to improve just because it got a little bit better?

381
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:58,770
I just... felt so frustrated.

382
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,160
I won't drink it.

383
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,680
What are you doing, still in here?

384
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,760
Huh? I mean...

385
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,950
I really

386
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:22,340
respected you, Congressman. This is a disappointment.

387
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,650
This isn't it!

388
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,710
How could you

389
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:30,700
drink something good like this alone?

390
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:43,840
This is better than any medicine the hospital gave you, right?

391
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,030
You're quite an interesting doctor.

392
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:50,600
You were quite interesting yourself.

393
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,080
I heard you take the subway to work.

394
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,890
Why do you do that, when you're already so busy?

395
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,330
Well, I just...

396
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,720
Congressman. It's been difficult, right?

397
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,880
No matter how difficult it is, you can't complain about it.

398
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,180
You have to be wary of others, and be careful with your words and actions.

399
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:17,530
You can't express anger because you're angry.

400
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:21,870
You can't go somewhere and drink comfortably.

401
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:25,160
It's actually more comfortable here, right?

402
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,670
When did you visit the insides of my mind?

403
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:32,370
I've been asked if I'm a psychic or fortune-teller.

404
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:40,600
I tell myself that nobody lives an easy life... but it's still difficult.

405
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,660
What's the most difficult?

406
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:49,910
I... keep turning into a liar.
