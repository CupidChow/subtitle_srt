1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,420

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:10,320

3
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,150
Are you done with your part-time job?

4
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,630
Did you come because you were curious about that?

5
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,430
I came to let you know that I enjoyed eating the kimbap.

6
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,370
If you want, how about having that consultation that we couldn't today?

7
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,900
Consultation? My a**.

8
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,170
Then instead of consultation, how about we just talk?

9
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,760
What would I have to talk about with a traitor?

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,500
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise to you today.

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,420
I heard what you said earlier to the Vice President.

12
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,610
If that's how you felt, why were you good to me, making me confused?

13
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,980
You are the same as the rest of them.

14
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,350
You played around with me.

15
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,580
At the very least, I thought you might be different.

16
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,460
Are you joking right now?

17
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,300
Why did you come, if this is what you were going to do?

18
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,880
I haven't even counted to 100.

19
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,400
I was counting to see when you would come back.

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,140
Oh, you're making me so angry!

21
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,830
Times like this, just throw a punch.

22
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,710
Like this. Ow.

23
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,510
Oh, that hurts.

24
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,970
What you heard earlier today, Woo Joo,

25
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,220
was not how I sincerely feel.

26
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,490
My sincere feelings...

27
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:06,380
you were different from other patients from the start.

28
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,430
How?

29
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,520
 Because you lingered in my heart every time we met.

30
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,110
So how was I different?

31
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,310
I knew, at first sight.

32
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,370
That you were very ill.

33
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,840
So you are saying that I suffer from a serious illness.

34
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,080
That we were similar.

35
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,550
So now, I have a goal.

36
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:42,100
At the very least,  I'll make it so you won't feel the need to chase after your adoptive mother anymore.

37
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:49,740
And I really want to help you stand on a musical stage again, Woo Joo.

38
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,330
- Doctor, you like me, don't you?
- What?

39
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:01,090
If you didn't, there is no way that you would be so good to me.

40
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,430
Please don't like me.

41
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,160
You will tell me you like me, then run away soon afterwards.

42
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,480
I will not run away.

43
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,410
The reason I am trying to treat you

44
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:17,370
is partly because I want to overcome my own trauma, too.

45
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,120
So Woo Joo, you are helping me.

46
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,930
A long time ago, I had a patient who was similar to you.

47
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,640
I couldn't fix that patient.

48
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,640
So you are a mountain that I must climb.

49
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,140
So if you get better, than I will, too.

50
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,940
In any case,

51
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,210
you do like me, don't you?

52
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,180
I do not.

53
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,440
- You're already caught.
 - I really don't, though.

54
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:11,910
From now on, we will only have consultations at the agreed time, in the office.

55
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,790
Consultations begin tomorrow

56
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:17,920
and you will get a text message from the hospital, so please be on time.

57
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,610
Then, I will go...

58
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,690
Look at him avoiding me.

59
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,450
How did she find out?

60
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,910
She sure is observant.

61
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,480

62
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,170
- Doctor, you're here?
 - It was a suicide attempt?

63
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,260
Yes, this way.

64
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,980
According to the guardian, he tried to swallow every pill in the house, so we started with the stomach pump.

65
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,740
Ok.

66
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,450
- He's a firefighter.
 - Yes, I think so.

67
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:12,530
My oppa was diagnosed with PTSD.

68
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:16,850
He was at a hospital linked to a Fire and Trauma Center. So he did get some treatment there.

69
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,280
So he's a rescue worker?

70
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,240
He's on leave from work right now.

71
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,190
- But why is he dressed that way...?
 - He won't take that uniform off.

72
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,900
He even wears it when he sleeps. He's not normal right now.

73
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,330
Then can you let me know more in detail what his status is?

74
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,650
He cannot stand to see anything plugged into an electrical outlet at home.

75
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,020
He pulls out even our rice cooker cord.

76
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,980
We had a fight today because I left my hair dryer plugged in.

77
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,540
Even if we go to a restaurant, he checks to see how many fire extinguishers there are,

78
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,660
and where the emergency exits are. That's what he looks for first.

79
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,640
Doctor, please admit my brother.

80
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,430
I feel like our family will all die of neurosis.

81
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,030

82
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll take him to the SR.
 (SR = seclusion room)

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,600
Please change him into a patient's robe.

84
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,950
- No, please just leave him.
 - Why?

85
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,000
It's his guardian's request.

86
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,900
Let's have him change into that after consultation tomorrow.

87
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,850
It will frighten the other patients.

88
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,570
That is why I'm sending him in to the SR.

89
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,880
For now, please leave him be.

90
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,300
He's been admitted, so

91
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,250
slowly, a little at a time,

92
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,290
he will get better, for sure. So please don't worry too much.

93
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,730
Ok.

94
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,750
Please take good care of him.

95
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,980
Who is it?

96
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,110
The guardian of a suicide attempt patient from ER. I had him admitted.

97
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,670
The cause?

98
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:08,180
I think he has both PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) and MDD (major depressive disorder).

99
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,940
What are you doing here at this hour? Didn't you leave work for the day?

100
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,180
- I came to sleep.
 - What's your house for?

101
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,140
Why are you on the all-night ER shift? What about the kids?

102
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,210
The kids said they're having a party for Kang Nu Ri at the Kong restaurant.

103
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,400
Woo Jung and Se Chan just got in so I'm about to leave.

104
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,720
Then shall we go have a drink together?

105
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,120
- Has something good happened?
 - No.

106
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,660
- Nothing.
 - No, something happened.

107
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,660
Nothing. I told you, nothing happened. Nothing at all.

108
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,380
If you don't want to drink with me, just go, you punk. Talking nonsense.

109
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,000
Go.

110
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,680
There's something.

111
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,450
 The reason I am trying to treat you

112
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,380
 is partly because I want to overcome my own trauma, too.

113
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,610
 So Woo Joo, you are helping me.

114
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,960
So is he saying that I am his doctor?

115
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,370
He says he's going to put me back on the stage.

116
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,280
It's nice.

117
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,190

118
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,240
It's a fire.

119
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,000
It's ok. It's ok.

120
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,090
Are you alright?

121
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,960
Wake up!

122
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,080
Please come to your senses.

123
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,100
Fire! Fire! Please wake up.

124
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,330
Please come to your senses.

125
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,740
Please evacuate! Please evacuate! Please evacuate!

126
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,560
Please wake up, please wake up.

127
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,920
Can you see me? Please evacuate.

128
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,260
Please evacuate!

129
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,840
It's a fire! Fire! Fire!

130
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,420
Doctor, a fire!

131
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,140
Are you alright? Are you hurt?

132
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,360
Please evacuate! Please follow me.

133
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,180
No, no.

134
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,380
Please, quickly!

135
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,140
Fire! Fire! Fire!

136
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,300
Fire! I have to rescue people.

137
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,350
Please calm down.

138
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,840
- Yes? 
 - Doctor, we need you at the clinic immediately.

139
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,420
Why? What happened?

140
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,980
Ok, I'll be right there.

141
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:57,400
It's ok. Nothing happened, so please return to your rooms.

142
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,710
Calm down, please. Calm down.

143
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:16,800
- What happened?
 - I'm sorry for the sudden call. I paged Dr. In first but he said to call you.

144
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,800
Ok, that's fine.

145
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,300
Are you ok?

146
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,900
- We have to save those people. 
 - Yes, ok, I understand.

147
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:33,740
First, let's breathe deeply. In and out.

148
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,860
In. Out.

149
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,880
In. Out.

150
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,030
In and out.

151
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:56,260
What do you see before your eyes now? Name three things you see now.

152
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,840
Ping-pong table.

153
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,800
Bookshelf.

154
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:18,490
Can you read this for me?

155
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,240

156
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,780
Psychiatrist Lee Si Joon.

157
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,970
Where do you think you are?

158
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,540
What are these people wearing now?

159
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,340
White gowns.

160
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,660
White sneakers.

161
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,230
Why do you keep smiling?

162
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:07,710
I don't know. I just keep smiling. Because I'm crazy.

163
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,240
Oh, you're here.

164
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,810
Your doctor is here.

165
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,790
Hello, I'm your doctor, In Dong Hyuk.

166
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,380
Who put me in this place?

167
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,680
Could you step outside?

168
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,780
Sure.

169
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,830
 Hey, you crazy jerk, how can you smile at this time?

170
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:02,740
 Stand up! Stand up, you jerk!

171
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,210
 Come outside. Come outside!

172
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,420
You got a diagnosis for PTSD?

173
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,240
That's enough. I'm leaving.

174
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,100
That might be difficult.

175
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:25,110
Should I explain what just happened to you?

176
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:29,610
You just experienced a flashback, didn't you?

177
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,960
Hey, Dr. Lee.

178
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,590
How are the other patients doing?

179
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,080
Well, they're settling down.

180
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,360
Thanks for that.

181
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,560
How's the firefighter?

182
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,940
Well, I want to let him rest today, do the consultation tomorrow, and start him on some meds.

183
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,030
How about combining that with cognitive behavioral therapy?

184
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:01,410
When I tried those grounding techniques with him earlier, it seemed to work right away.

185
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,730
I'll take care of it.

186
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,390
Oh right, I'm sorry.

187
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,100
I'm heading out.

188
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,130
I'll call you. Thank you!

189
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,570
What are you doing here so early?

190
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,490
I wanted to help you open.

191
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:08,410
I get all nervous when you do things you don't usually do. What's going on now?

192
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:11,800
You suddenly disappeared yesterday. Did you meet Dr. Lee by any chance?

193
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,820
Wow... How'd you know?

194
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,520
It turns out I misunderstood what I heard yesterday.

195
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:25,200
This is what he said to me yesterday,

196
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,790
that he'll make it so I don't chase after my adoptive mother anymore.

197
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,710
I was totally moved.

198
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:36,510
Wow, how touching.

199
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,120
The truth is, he's ill too.

200
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,680
Well, he's got you, and all his other patients to deal with. It'd be weird for him to be well.

201
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,330
If you tell me that you and the doctor

202
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:54,480
have resolved your misunderstanding, are comforting each other, or even are dating, that's fine by me. But be careful.

203
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,410
He's not going to hurt me again.

204
00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:00,320
That's not what I mean. I meant be careful for his sake.

205
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,850
If the rumor starts that he's dating you, it'll be trouble for him at the hospital.

206
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:09,640
I'll cheer you on as your friend because you say you like him, but he's not in that position.

207
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,000
Others won't just sit by and watch. You both could end up alone.

208
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,340
You're right.

209
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,590
Ok.

210
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:23,780
I'll be really careful, for his sake.

211
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,170
I heard from Ji Hee that the hospital's Vice President?

212
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,720
That he doesn't get along with him.

213
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,380
  I'm this hospital's Vice President.

214
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,440
 Oh I see.

215
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,750
 You're the actress that helps out with our theatrical therapy, right?

216
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:43,720
I knew it. That man purposely approached me! That Vice President!

217
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,120
He did it on purpose to force Dr. Lee to go public!

218
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:51,740
Wow, and I didn't even know that and answered all his questions!

219
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,960
I had a bad feeling too.

220
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,730
As he approached me, I just felt it.

221
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,910
He used me to give Dr. Lee trouble!

222
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,520
Give me that.

223
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,710
Hello all.

224
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,470
Sunbae, you're already coming back to work?

225
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,320
Do you feel better going out now?

226
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,990
Thanks to you guys.

227
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,810
I couldn't keep hiding away.

228
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,740
I'm glad.

229
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,920
Wow, Nu Ri sunbae.

230
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,770
Welcome back.

231
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,630
Why don't you go wash up first before you welcome her?

232
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,520
What time is it? Oh!

233
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,800
My biggest concern is controlling my emotions.

234
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,830
Especially anger. I can't hold it back once I feel angry.

235
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:44,210
Dr. Ji told me to try holding back for just six seconds, but

236
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:47,240
six seconds is a really long time.

237
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:51,040
I'm just mentioning this since you brought up Dr. Ji,

238
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,170
but are you angry with her?

239
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:57,810
No, I felt that way before, but now it's all ok.

240
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,480
Why were you so angry then?

241
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,410
When I found out that the two of you had discussed me,

242
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:06,720
I just felt completely exposed.

243
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,320
Exposed, vulnerable, and thrown out on the street.

244
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:20,780
Woo Joo, by any chance, did you have that type of experience when you were younger?

245
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:24,490
Whether at the orphanage or your adoptive parents?

246
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,270
Did you?

247
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,580
No. I didn't.

248
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,670
Let's have dinner sometime with Dr. Ji.

249
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,040
To resolve everything?

250
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,140
Sure.

251
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:45,740
How do you feel, thinking about resolving things with Dr. Ji?

252
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:53,250
How should I put it? It's like...

253
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:58,800
taking a walk on a spring day, not too hot, not too cold, with a soft breeze.

254
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,400
And the path looks so inviting... that feeling?

255
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,320
How should I describe a feeling like that?

256
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,330
It's happiness.

257
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:14,530
People have the ability to heal each other, as much as they can damage each other.

258
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:19,250
And repairing relationships is the key to happiness.

259
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,990
- Vice President! Hello.
 - Oh, hello.

260
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,120
Were you here to see Dr. Lee?

261
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,040
No.

262
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,090
Oh, then theatrical therapy?

263
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,310
I'm here to see you, Vice President.

264
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:50,450
Me? Do you have something to say to me?

265
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,110
- How could a person be like that?
 - What?

266
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:56,630
- Last time, you spied on me, didn't you? 
- What are you--

267
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,920
You asked me this and that about my personal life, didn't you?

268
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,970
What exactly were you trying to accomplish?

269
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:03,900
Could you please move over here?

270
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,540
I'm asking you what your purpose was!

271
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:10,050
Can't you please lower your voice?

272
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,410
I think you've misunderstood something.

273
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,860
You see, I thought

274
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,350
you looked like such a good person that

275
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,820
I answered all your questions so easily,

276
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,520
but you shouldn't abuse your kindly face to scam people like that!

277
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,060
Scam?

278
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,500
You told on me to the hospital director!

279
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,690
You are speaking too harshly.

280
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,910
Don't you see how wronged I feel?

281
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,020
What do you feel wronged by?

282
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,740
I have absolutely no relationship with Dr. Lee Si Joon.

283
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,670
But you went around making rumors in this hospital.

284
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,290
I didn't say a thing.

285
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:46,260
I heard it myself! You were telling Dr. Lee off!

286
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,950
You might not know,

287
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,130
but when I started the theatrical therapy job, I signed a contract.

288
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:57,410
You cannot mistreat someone just because they are a temporary employee these days.

289
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:01,180
Keep that in mind because I fully intend to complete the terms of the contract.

290
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,880
And if you fire me,

291
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,420
I will put in on SNS right away.

292
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,540
Do you understand?!

293
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,340
Dr. Lee put her up to this.

294
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:24,460
No question about it. This jerk.

295
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,270
Doctor, I...

296
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,050
I see ghosts.

297
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:40,960
What you're seeing are not ghosts. They're flashbacks.

298
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,850
It's one of the symptoms for patients suffering from PTSD.

299
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,310
But that's the same thing.

300
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:52,230
After marrying, we split up after less than two years.

301
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:56,460
Why do you think we split up? Because every night I had nightmares.

302
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:02,470
Whenever I wake up, I see smoke everywhere, and even smell human flesh burning.

303
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:05,510
To me, it's unmistakably a fire.

304
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:09,580
I see kids everywhere, collapsed on the ground. I become half-crazy

305
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,590
and try to rescue those people.

306
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:16,400
My ex-wife said this to me as we split,

307
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,140
"All I want is to sleep peacefully."

308
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:28,480
And why don't you take off the uniform? Isn't it stifling?

309
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,380
It's my punishment for myself.

310
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,900
Those children...

311
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,810
those children, in that hot flame,

312
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:44,030
they must have suffocated to death.

313
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:49,880
But if I wore nice clothes and lived a comfortable life, I would feel sorry to them.

314
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,140
Help us! Save us!

315
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,340
Are you alright? Are you alright?

316
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,240
Open your eyes!

317
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,210
Are you alright?

318
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,600
Are you alive?

319
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,310
I'm here to help you!

320
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:16,240
Anyone?

321
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,710
Baek Hong Min, age 35, occupation is firefighter. Currently, he is suffering from PTSD and MDD

322
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,920
simultaneously, based on my observation.

323
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,360
Ten months ago, he was at the fire at the middle school training center.

324
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,960
And currently, he is suffering from severe flashbacks.

325
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,140
The results of a functional MRI were that negative stimulation

326
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:29,610
created excessive response in the amygdala.

327
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:33,510
Once we prescribe medication and one-on-one talk therapy and he is stabilized

328
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,740
I plan to begin cognitive behavioral therapy.

329
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:40,880
I have a firefighter suffering from PTSD among my patients, too.

330
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,430
But his symptoms are the opposite. He can't feel anything at all.

331
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,620
Nothing at all?

332
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:52,010
In fact, he doesn't fear fire at all. He puts the gaslight out with his hand.

333
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:55,960
Even if he saw someone who died by having his limbs torn off, he says he feels nothing.

334
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,470
I have someone similar among my patients, too.

335
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:03,130
His occupation is firefighter as well. He said he was agonized whenever he saw a dead body

336
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:06,480
but he suddenly changed, and no matter how violently someone was killed,

337
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,860
he didn't feel any emotion.

338
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,670
So how are you treating him right now?

339
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:14,690
He suddenly stopped treatment three months ago.

340
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,780
Dr. In.

341
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:23,150
How about gathering PTSD patients who are suffering from similar trauma and treating them together?

342
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,280
- Do you mean group therapy?
 - Yes.

343
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,630
Group therapy won't work.

344
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:30,410
Group therapy amongst patients with different symptoms and conditions can actually have a reverse effect.

345
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:36,710
But I think a group therapy for patients who have suffered similar damage could be different.

346
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:41,650
Seeing how Firefighter Baek is still suffering flashbacks 10 months after the incident,

347
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:44,150
I think he needs a different treatment plan.

348
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:49,690
It's true a different treatment plan is needed, but not group therapy.

349
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:56,230
Then what other method can be used for cognitive behavioral therapy?

350
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,050
I will have to research that, but

351
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:02,210
the theatrical therapy we've been doing a lot at our hospital can be considered as an option.

352
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:05,390
And the problem with his family members appears to be serious at the moment, as well.

353
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,530
I understand your concerns, Dr. In.

354
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:11,780
But for those who suffered similar damage, to share their experiences with each other

355
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,900
can be very effective.

356
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:18,250
I think you should try it. It could be a case study as well.

357
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:24,100
I'm sure that there are other patients who are firefighters suffering from similar PTSD.

358
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,170
Let's try treating them together.

359
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,970
Dr. Ji Young Won goes to the National Trauma Center,

360
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,780
so I will ask her for some help.

361
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,300
Is that so? That's fortunate.

362
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,780
Then contact her...

363
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,580
Hello.

364
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,460
This is Dr. In Dong Hyuk from Eun Kang Medical Center.
