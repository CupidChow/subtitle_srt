1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,360

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:10,550

3
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,810

4
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,110
The other day, the Hospital Director

5
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:30,280
asked me to be the head of the Clinic.

6
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,160
I told her that I would think about it.

7
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,150
You don't intend to refuse, do you?

8
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,230
I do intend to refuse.

9
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,070
Why?

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,290
I thought it over for a long time

11
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,420
An old man like me shouldn't be the head of the Clinic.

12
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,160
Lee Si Joon, you should do it.

13
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:02,260
That makes no sense. How can I be the Clinic head?

14
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,370
I can't do it. I won't do it. I don't want to.

15
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,590
Don't just say you don't want to do it. Consider it sincerely.

16
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,620
Think about what the right choice is for the patients.

17
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,430
To treat this world that is going increasingly crazy

18
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:24,630
we need treatment methods that are more varied than traditional methods.

19
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,150
In order to do that, more advanced,

20
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,010
multidisciplinary research is necessary, don't you think?

21
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,620
And isn't that your dream?

22
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,470
Oh, but still, I can't.

23
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,020
You can think about it.

24
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,490
I'd like to make another suggestion.

25
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:58,060
Didn't you say this, Director? This nation has many wounds, but not enough cures.

26
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,190
And that is why you thought of a Mental Health Clinic.

27
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,350
Dr. Lee, more than anyone else, will operate

28
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,060
the mental health center towards that purpose.

29
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,880
To be honest, I am quite flustered.

30
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,540
You know it yourself that Doctor Lee is like no other.

31
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,380
That is precisely the reason for my hesitation.

32
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:23,600
But it seems to me that you've always made choices that was different from others.

33
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,610
Me?

34
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,630
Having studied medicine despite your family's opposition.

35
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,640
And your choice to get into management in order to create a good hospital.

36
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,960
They were all brave choices.

37
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,820
I am sure that you've made those choices

38
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,140
after thinking it over a lot.

39
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,380
And Dr. Lee, just because his personality is eccentric,

40
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,880
he does not treat the patients in an eccentric way.

41
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,230
The treatment methods Dr. Lee is using now

42
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,300
are the results of having studied day and night for a very long time.

43
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,280
Dr. Lee, since he was a resident, until now,

44
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,900
he never stopped his research.

45
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,750
When he was a resident he practically

46
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,990
lived with his patients in the hospital ward.

47
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:25,570
I've never met another doctor who only thinks about his patients whenever he is awake like Dr. Lee does.

48
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:32,570
I acknowledge that Dr. Lee's treatment methods are excellent.

49
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:36,630
The healing of the patient is the main purpose of the mental health clinic.

50
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,320
Isn't that what you said, Director?

51
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,510
If so, then what is the problem?

52
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,650
Whatever method is used, how is that important?

53
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:51,590
Director, the mental health clinic should be entrusted, not to someone like Vice President Oh

54
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,270
but a young person who is not afraid of change or experimentation.

55
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,990
Please try entrusting him. I will diligently

56
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,390
stay by his side to help him.

57
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,250
Ah, yes, Director.

58
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,760
Oh, you're working so hard.

59
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,990
Welcome.

60
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,350
My office felt stuffy

61
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,180
so I asked to meet you here.

62
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,560
And the weather is so nice today.

63
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,210
Yes.

64
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,530
Please sit.

65
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,640
The preparations for the mental health clinic is going well?

66
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,770
Of course. I'm putting so much effort into it.

67
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:20,630
All you've left to do is make that decision you've been putting off.

68
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,610
So, about that,

69
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,900
I just made an important decision.

70
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,730
I hope that you won't oppose it, Vice President.

71
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,560
Have I ever disagreed with your decisions, Director?

72
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,830
I always respected them.

73
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:38,520
That is true, but I think you will disagree this time.

74
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,510
How can that be?

75
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,600
That will never happen.

76
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:48,760
So our first head of the Mental Health Clinic

77
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,570
will be Dr. Lee Si Joon.
 - What?

78
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,040
Dr. Lee Si Joon.

79
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,650
That was unexpected, wasn't it?

80
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,460
Are you that shocked?

81
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,940
- Director, this isn't right.
 - What?

82
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,040
Not even Park Dae Ha, but Lee Si Joon?

83
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,030
You're going to make Lee Si Joon the head of the clinic?

84
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,250
Do you not know what kind of person he is?

85
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,270
I do know, that is why I'm giving him this responsibility.

86
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,150
This is Park Dae Ha's scheme, huh?

87
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,990
You should not do this, Director.

88
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,630
I cannot accept this at all.

89
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,220
How can you say Lee Si Joon is the head of the clinic?

90
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,610
Vice President, you're crossing the line.

91
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,970
It's because this is so ridiculous.

92
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:28,660
That cannot happen. Lee Si Joon cannot be the head of the clinic.

93
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:37,040
Of all the people in the world, Lee Si Joon? Is she joking?

94
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,580

95
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,840

96
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,940
No, that's what I heard.

97
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:05,480
The Vice President was so upset and saying that Lee Si Joon cannot become the head of the clinic.

98
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,490
So he's not the head yet, right?

99
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,760
No, he must have already become the head, and that is why Vice President opposes it.

100
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,260
Isn't that a great thing?

101
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,560
It's quite a twist.

102
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,910
I thought the head would be the Vice President.

103
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,220
Dr. Lee isn't answering his phone, though.

104
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,390
He wouldn't say no to the offer, will he?

105
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:25,170
I think that he will.

106
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,310
Theatrical therapy has three main methods.

107
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,490
The first is when the participant uses his body

108
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,490
and the sense of touch to express himself.

109
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,690
The second is to use objects

110
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,950
to express himself.

111
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,180
Today, we will use this cloth

112
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,170
to express our emotions.

113
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,810
What meaning does this have?

114
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:09,270
These are stepping stones.

115
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,820
So I am stepping on these stones to cross over.

116
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,850
The floor is the water.

117
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:23,880
And I am standing about here.

118
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,360
But there is a strong wave in the water.

119
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,190
So I'm waiting for the wave to pass.

120
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,660
And as I wait, I exercise like this.

121
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,270
That is so good.

122
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,640
Let's all give Woo Joo a round of applause.

123
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,360
What brings you here?

124
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,040
Can you make some time for me today?

125
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,180
Has something happened?

126
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:57,800
I have something to ponder about, and I thought that being with you will help me find the answer.

127
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,830
Wow, I am someone who can give you answers?

128
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,490
- You didn't know that?
 - I did not.

129
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,500
Well, I am quite busy, but

130
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,380
I will spend time with you.

131
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,030
What are you doing, anyway? How long will you hide it from me?

132
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,280
- Maybe in about a year from now?
- Huh?

133
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,660
I will surprise you.

134
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,520
A whole year?

135
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,910
Then we can do what I want today, right?

136
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,140
♫  I love you  ♫

137
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:48,590
♫  I always have  ♫

138
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,390
- Doctor.
- Yes.

139
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:55,040
The loser buys ice cream.

140
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,080
Sounds good.

141
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:03,570
♫  I am the most grateful for that  ♫

142
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:13,070
♫  Do you remember what I've told you before?  ♫

143
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:18,640
♫  When I think of you, it gets better.  ♫

144
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,700
♫  In the unknown days,   ♫

145
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,390
This one.

146
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,850
♫   and nights that are far away  ♫

147
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:31,990
♫  we can be each other's courage  ♫

148
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,720
♫  Let's walk together always  ♫

149
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,380
♫  Let's walk together always  ♫

150
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,870
What have you been listening to?

151
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,540
- What?
 - What are you listening to?

152
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,960
Ji Sun arranged this, want to hear it?

153
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,080
Her musical arrangement skills are amazing.

154
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,400
Right? I was surprised, too.

155
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,220
I wrote lyrics to it. Would you like to hear them?

156
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,550
Dr. In, welcome.

157
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,400
You heard about the clinic head, right?

158
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,610
Yes, I heard.

159
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,380
Our Director, she's not in her right mind, is she?

160
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:15,520
It's all Park Dae Ha's scheme. What should we do?

161
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,090
Dr. In, you're younger and smarter than I am, so let's hear your thoughts.

162
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,280
What do you mean?

163
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,670
Come on. Lee Si Joon hasn't accepted the offer yet.

164
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,250
So we have to block him so that he can't accept it.

165
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:31,900
I hear he's not even answering his phone. I think he doesn't want it, either.

166
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:37,990
Dr. In, you find out. No, go and stop him. Tell him to never accept.

167
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,980
Dr. In, are you peeved about what happened before?

168
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,890
No.

169
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:50,960
You don't know that the one who suspected you of taking drugs was not me but Chief Park, do you?

170
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,440
Vice President, what are you talking about?

171
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,880
I said that you would never do that from the beginning.

172
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,780
Chief Park was the first to suggest that something was weird, and that we shouldn't write you a letter of recommendation.

173
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:12,320
Vice President, I know you must be stressed and having a tough time tonight. So maybe you should go home to rest.

174
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,840
Seeing how your memory seems flawed, I think you may be in a state of shock.

175
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,320
Allow me to take you home.

176
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,250
You worked hard today for my sake.

177
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,240
It wasn't work.

178
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,390
Did you come to a decision regarding what you were thinking about?

179
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,050
Whatever decision you make, I will cheer you on.

180
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,990
Go on in.

181
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:52,540
Question. Do I seem different to you, too?

182
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:58,080
People keep telling me that I've changed.

183
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:05,070
Woo Joo, you didn't change. This is the real you.

184
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:09,020
From the beginning, this is who you were

185
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:13,730
but you were hidden due to various reasons.

186
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:20,600
Really, you've moved me twice today.

187
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,930
Right answer. This is who I always was.

188
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:30,200
I'm a bit embarrassed now. I'll go now.

189
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:11,570
A condition? Of course.

190
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:16,920
If you just said, "Yes, thank you," it wouldn't be Dr. Lee Si Joon.

191
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,520
So tell me what condition you are demanding.

192
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,530
Will you meet my demand?

193
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:23,990
I can only do that after I hear what it is.

194
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:28,580
Please allow the clinic's head to make all decisions for the mental health clinic.

195
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,660
- So you want to do whatever you want without any interference.
 - Yes.

196
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,990
And that requires tremendous responsibility, you understand that?

197
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,130
Of course.

198
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:43,740
I will be watching you.

199
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,260
I honestly thought you'd say no.

200
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,610
You're not interested in status.

201
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,540
Were you disappointed?

202
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,080
I don't care who becomes the clinic's head anymore.

203
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,990
- Because you're going to Johns Hopkins?
 - That's right.

204
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,530
- Did you tell Young Won?
 - Not yet.

205
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,410
She will miss you a lot.

206
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:13,970
I confessed my feelings to her, that I like her.

207
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:20,960
- What did she say?
 - You know her. She pretended to be calm, thinking of my feelings.

208
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,150
So I'm just waiting for her.

209
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:30,210
When I heard I was accepted to Johns Hopkins, my first thought was about her.

210
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,350
Don't worry about her and have a good trip.

211
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:39,370
I will, so you set up the mental health clinic properly.

212
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,750
You've just taken on a very heavy burden. You are prepared, aren't you?

213
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:50,230
Dong Hyuk, do you think I can do well?

214
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,530
Of course. You will.

215
00:16:53,530 --> 00:17:00,610
Because you are Dr. Lee Taek Kyung's son, Lee Si Joon.

216
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,900
Everyone is gathered, right?

217
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,450
I'm on my way, so discuss beforehand.

218
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,730
Why is this useless?

219
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,740
Then just let Lee Si Joon have the position?

220
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,220
Find some way to block him, no matter what it is.

221
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,500
They have no tenacity...

222
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,400
Vice President!

223
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,790
Are you alright?

224
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,970
Please call the emergency department!

225
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,200
Are you alright, Vice President?

226
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:47,950
It's respiratory difficulty due to sudden mental shock and stress.

227
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:53,360
Since you are hospitalized, shall I ask them to run some more tests?

228
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,880
Don't pretend to care about me. You're laughing at me on the inside.

229
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,620
What is the big deal about being the clinic head that you would even collapse?

230
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,010
This won't do.

231
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,140
Want a consultation with me?

232
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,770
You dare to treat me like a patient?

233
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:15,590
You are a patient. You haven't slept well lately, have you?

234
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,730
How bad has it been? Be honest.

235
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,570
How could I sleep?

236
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:25,290
I feel like the world has collapsed to the ground and my life is falling behind...

237
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,080
Are you crying?

238
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,550
Get out. Get out now!

239
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,860
Don't loiter here and get out!

240
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,890
Okay, got it. I'm going.

241
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:39,290
- What are you doing? Get out!
- Fine, fine.

242
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,620
Yes?

243
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,860
I was just going to greet you.

244
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,400
You're the clinic head, so I should come to you.

245
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,000
- Oh, don't be like that.
 - You've made a big decision.

246
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,690
And it was a good one.

247
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:16,230
I will work hard to do well.

248
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:20,060
I am sure you will, Dr. Lee.

249
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:26,260
- Vice President, he seems unwell. What should we do?
- Why?

250
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:32,110
After he heard that you accepted the position, he collapsed.

251
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,920
- What?
 - He suddenly burst into tears.

252
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,460
He cried?

253
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:45,420
He worked all this time, only aiming for the clinic head position, so it's understandable.

254
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,580
I think it's a sudden stress reaction.

255
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,030
- I will visit him later.
 - And do what?

256
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,620

257
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,290
Doctor.

258
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,090
Doctor, congratulations.

259
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,370
No need. It's all just hard work from now on.

260
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,330
Doctor, what do we do to help you now?

261
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:06,660
Isn't that for you to figure out?

262
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,850
We will try.

263
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,760
We will write a report and submit it.

264
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,310
Doctor, congratulations.

265
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,130
Thank you.

266
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,480
Hello.

267
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,880
Doctor, congratulations.

268
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,430
Doctor, we heard the news. Congratulations.

269
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,610
You don't have to.

270
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,130
Congratulations.

271
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,150
- Did you come to see the patients? It's been a while.
 - Yes.

272
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,990
They all went for a walk, and they're asleep now.

273
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,660
Then let me briefly just see their faces.

274
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,330
- You must not wake them.
 - Yes.

275
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,230
Let me go alone.

276
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,110
Looks like you're going home today, Cha Yun Woo?

277
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,920
Yes, I'm being released today.

278
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,930
Isn't it nice to be able to go home?

279
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,130
I... don't have a home anymore.

280
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,710
Why not?

281
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:39,030
My family all moved while I was hospitalized.

282
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,210
They even changed their phone numbers.

283
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:46,320
It's okay. I still have places to go.

284
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,860
Are you really okay?

285
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:53,420
Of course. Thank you, Dr. Lee.

286
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,160
 Psychiatry Department

287
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,380
Did Cha Yun Woo's family really all move away?

288
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,590
Yes, I also heard it from him.

289
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,020
It's been a while since his family stopped visiting him.

290
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:22,430
I'm sure it's been difficult for his family, too. He's been coming to the hospital for years.

291
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:25,660
But moving without him knowing is too much.

292
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,900
He didn't seem to have anywhere to go, either.

293
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,640
We can't do anything about that.

294
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,320
There are more patients who get discharged and are abandoned by their family than you may think.

295
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,090
That's true. Ms. Kim Young Sun, who kept coming back for alcoholism.

296
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:44,230
She says she intentionally drinks because she wants to come here.

297
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,700
She knows she'll just end up drinking again if she goes home.

298
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,480
I always worry about her because I feel like she'll always be back in a few days.

299
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,980
Dr. Lee, what will happen to the wards?

300
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,450
All the wards will be moved to the Mental Health Clinic.

301
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,210
There will be so many more rooms there, too.

302
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:04,920
Then are all the nurses here also moving there?

303
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,640
How can I even imagine a hospital ward without you, Nurse Oh?

304
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,730
Dr. Lee, will I go there as well?

305
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:11,960
Of course!

306
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,990
Will we go, too?

307
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,110
- Hello. 
 - Welcome!

308
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,300
Did you come alone today?

309
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,820
Yes, I'm here alone today.

310
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,340
- What would you like? 
 - Can I get banquet noodles?

311
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,600
That's not on the menu...

312
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,640
- I'll make it for you! 
 - Thank you.

313
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:42,180
What the heck? You make banquet noodles now? Since when?

314
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,830
He's a regular here.

315
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:49,570
Did you know that Dr. Lee became the Head of the Mental Health Clinic?

316
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,680
He became the clinic head? Really?

317
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,830
Yes. He was thinking about it, but I think he accepted the position today.

318
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,320
Han Woo Joo, what the heck? Did you know about this?

319
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:04,240
No, I just knew he was debating about something all day yesterday.

320
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,040
That's so good.

321
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,350
Han Woo Joo, from now on

322
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:12,660
you can't say anything like people around you suffer because of you, or anything like that.

323
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,980
- What? 
 - It's just been proved.

324
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,600
It's not true.

325
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,190
That's true.

326
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,600
Ta-da! Enjoy.

327
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,120
Thank you.

328
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,920
Excuse me.

329
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,950
Later, do you want to get patbingsoo? 
 (T/N: Shaved ice dessert with sweet red bean)

330
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,500
What did you say?

331
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,180
Let's go eat patbingsoo.

332
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,120
 Congratulations.

333
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:01,380
 In Dong Hyuk

334
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:25,340
It's been a while since you've stopped taking medications, but your tic symptoms have stopped.

335
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,550
Is anything uncomfortable for you?

336
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:32,160
Not at all. I experience no symptoms.

337
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,330
My body and mind are both so relaxed now.

338
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:39,350
You'll need to maintain this state, but it won't be easy.

339
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:43,490
Let's end treatment today. I won't make any further appointments.

340
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:49,990
- You should come back if your symptoms return or things get difficult, okay? 
 - Okay.

341
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:53,160
You did some hard work during treatment.

342
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:59,050
I'm not your patient anymore, right?

343
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,930
I have something I'm curious about.

344
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:07,340
Do you... have a boyfriend?

345
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,240
Are you really curious about that?

346
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,930
I do.

347
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,420
Young Won... I have something to say to you today.

348
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:31,760
What is it?

349
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,820
You've already confessed to me and hugged me. You've already done it all.

350
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,420
When you put it that way, I can't bring myself to say it even more.

351
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,190
What is it that's so hard to say?

352
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:47,850
Si Joon became the Mental Health Clinic's Head. He met the Hospital Director today and accepted the position.

353
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:52,530
- That's so good for him. But Si Joon accepted? 
 - Yes.

354
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,340
Isn't that unexpected?

355
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,140
We'll have to congratulate him. Let's get together!

356
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:02,720
But... that's not what you wanted to say to me.

357
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,330
Hurry up and say it.

358
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,740
I'm going to Johns Hopkins for a year.

359
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:21,430
They must have liked the research I published for the World Psychiatric Association last year.

360
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:26,100
They'll let me focus on my research for a year.

361
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,600
In Dong Hyuk, you've finally made it.

362
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:34,400
Before I sent my forms to them, I wanted to ask you something.

363
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,350
Can I go?

364
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:42,890
One year isn't that long,

365
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:48,290
but when I think about our relationship right now, it seems very long.

366
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:52,440
You should go. In Dong Hyuk, you're really an idiot.

367
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,750
Is this even something to ponder?

368
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:58,170
Why would you miss this opportunity? Of course you should go.

369
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,530
That's upsetting.

370
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,760
I'll be right where I've always been.

371
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:12,770
Of course, I'll be aging a year, but I'll also be improving that much.

372
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,350
Will you wait for me?

373
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:22,690
I need time as well. I think a year is just enough.

374
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,640
Go well, and return.

375
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:32,400
I still have some time before I leave.

376
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:42,490
How do you feel? I heard you collapsed this afternoon.

377
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:48,760
You came to gloat, huh? The winner came to look at the loser.

378
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,870
Why did you want to be the clinic's head so much?

379
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:03,980
Because it's the top. Isn't it a natural desire of all humans?

380
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:10,150
I was so good to the Director.

381
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:13,480
How can she do this to me?

382
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,450
Are you uncomfortable anywhere else?

383
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:21,000
I've mulled it over while lying here.

384
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,080
What did you think about?

385
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:28,740
This is a conspiracy. Park Dae Ha's conspiracy.

386
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,250
He meets often with the Director outside of work. Someone saw it.

387
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:36,000
This is all Park Dae Ha's doing.

388
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,200
Vice President...

389
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:47,820
But no matter how much Park Dae Ha tried to scheme against me, I did so much for her.

390
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:51,210
She shouldn't be able to cast me away so easily.

391
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:54,130
But she changed so suddenly.

392
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:01,740
No matter how I think about it, I haven't made a single mistake. I've never even talked about the Director outside the hospital.

393
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:08,180
Just in case my words got twisted. Just a few times in my own office...

394
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,440
Right, that's it.

395
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,710
Vice President, would you like to listen to me for a little bit?

396
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:17,140
That's right, that's right.

397
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:21,570
Vice President? Vice President?

398
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,370
Where are you going?

399
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:27,330
Vice President? Where are you going?

400
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,610
Surveillance equipment.

401
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:32,630
- Huh?
 - My office definitely has surveillance equipment inside.

402
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,940
Vice President?

403
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:45,350
I'm sure it's somewhere here.

404
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:50,930
I did criticize her a few times in here.

405
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:54,340
But why isn't it here?

406
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,270
Did they already remove it?

407
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:00,230
Vice President. Vice President.

408
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:04,450
Will you please look at yourself, Vice President?

409
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,170
What?

410
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:11,460
And look around the room, please.

411
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:17,730
Do you remember what you just did?

412
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:26,500
So I finally lose my mind, huh?

413
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,440
Do you remember how you got here?

414
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,500
I do.

415
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,790
I remember it all.

416
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,140
Are you feeling sick anywhere else?

417
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,860
I'm alright.

418
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:44,650
Let's go. Let me give you some medicine...

419
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:49,020
I'm fine, so call Nurse Oh.

420
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,190
I understand.

421
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,930
I'll sleep a bit. Let me sleep.

422
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:04,270
You'll feel better after a good sleep.

423
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,930
- Leave him to me.
 - Yes.
