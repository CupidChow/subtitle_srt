1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,630

You kids.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,490
Sorry.

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,130
Hey, get up.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,260
- Call a cab. 
 - There's no need.

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,060
We're okay.

6
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:19,180
Just take it!

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,000
What are we going to do with that meddler?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Thank you!

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,620
These punks! You know I adore you guys, right?

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,980
Go. Head home now.

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,990
Hey, get up.

12
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,350
You're going to be broke. Food, alcohol, and allowance too?

13
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,440
Are you running a charity?

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,810
I wish I could... run a charity.

15
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,780
How kind-hearted you are.

16
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,960
Stop eating.

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,870
Woo Joo, long time no see.

18
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,470
You too.

19
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:08,220
Who are you? You look familiar, but I can't remember who you are.

20
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,280
That's true. I wouldn't recognize you passing by the street.

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,570
When did she become so shabby?

22
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,980
You can't tell even when she dresses up.

23
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm hungry! Give me some food.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,850
I can't. I have no ingredients.

25
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,470
There's no way... I've been starving all day.

26
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,470
At least give me some noodles!

27
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,490
Eat me.

28
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,550
Gosh, she really bit me!

29
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,300
Give me some food!

30
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,720
- Let go of me! 
 - I'm hungry.

31
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,530
- What are you doing? 
 - Cook me some food!

32
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,850
What's wrong with you?

33
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,900
Dr. Lee, are you heading out?

34
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,000
Are you coming back in?

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,550
I live alone anyway.

36
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:02,830
This is a picture of Kim  Yu Ra from three months ago.

37
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,560
It's so different from how she is now.

38
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,080
Is this really a picture of her?

39
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,530
Yes. Her guardian confirmed it.

40
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:13,540
She started getting treatment for her skin about three months ago, so something must have happened then.

41
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,930
Did you go all the way to a patient's house to find out the cause of her condition?

42
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,830
Don't you do that as well?

43
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:32,710
Is there nothing I can do to help them?

44
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,300
You're such a meddler. Stop trying to barge into the lives of others.

45
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,860
How can you call them 'others'? They're my juniors.

46
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:44,250
Your face will be swollen at your award show tomorrow, since you've been drinking.

47
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,380
It's been my dream to step on a red carpet.

48
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:57,110
Even though I get to make my dream a reality tomorrow, something doesn't feel all that great.

49
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:01,040
Stop thinking useless thoughts and go sleep.

50
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,670
What are you doing tomorrow? Back to the baseball stadium?

51
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,530
- I'm going as a reporter to the award show. 
 - Really?

52
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,340
I might run into you then, huh?

53
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,530
How is this?

54
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,920
Excuse me.

55
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,660
Hello?

56
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,440
I'm getting ready right now.

57
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,700
What? Me?

58
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,520
Do I really have a chance at getting the award?

59
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,240
Don't worry! I'll make sure I'm not late.

60
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,280
Yes. Okay!

61
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,360
Leave. Get out!

62
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,070
I'm not going to go!

63
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,600
Please calm down.

64
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,750
I'm not going to the psychiatry wing!

65
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,510
I'm telling you, I'm not crazy!

66
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,170
How is she?

67
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,900
She refuses any type of medication. The denial is serious.

68
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,890
- What is this? 
 - It's Kim Yu Ra.

69
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,030
Woo Jung found that yesterday. It's a picture from three months ago.

70
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:25,370
- This is her? 
 - She's lost so much weight. She's almost unrecognizable.

71
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,230
Don't you think this may be the cause of her delusional parasitosis?

72
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,320
Woo Jung's really something.

73
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,500
Hello?

74
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,740
Okay.

75
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,470
- Is something wrong? 
 - I need to go.

76
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,770

77
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,380
Dr. Lee!

78
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,060
Are you sure? Have you looked everywhere?

79
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,880
We checked the CCTV. He went outside.

80
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,640
What should we do? He'll be immediately transferred if he gets caught.

81
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,290
What should we do?

82
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,780
- Who else knows about this? 
 - Just us. I didn't tell anyone else.

83
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,040
Don't let anyone know until I find him.

84
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,280
Okay.

85
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,980
Do you guys understand what you did wrong?

86
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,760
Yes. We're sorry.

87
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,690
- What's the plan now? 
 - We will move more diligently!

88
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,160
We will be better!

89
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,210
Figure out how to treat patient Kim Yu Ra and bring your ideas here. Fast.

90
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,880
Yes, sir!

91
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,720

92
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,660
I told him so clearly not to leave.

93
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,180
Wait until I find you.

94
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,860
This time, I won't let it slide.

95
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:45,080
 Seungsan interchange is showing heavy traffic.

96
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,160
 There are signs of traffic slowdown near downtown.

97
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,250
 But the impact should not be too bad yet.

98
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,130
Near Changdong Bridge, the Dongbu Expressway is showing heavy traffic in both directions.

99
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,550
 Other bridges in the area are also showing a slowdown,

100
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,090
 as well as at the Seongdong bridge...

101
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:04,690
 In addition,  the Seoul Expressway near the Topyeong intersection...

102
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,980
 is also experiencing traffic.

103
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,700
 More congestion is expected as the...

104
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,880

105
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,970
Please wait a moment.

106
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,200
Please cross now.

107
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,760
Thank you!

108
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,970
 Hey guys!

109
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:33,340
I haven't seen you around before, where are you from?

110
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,580
I'm Officer Cha Dong Il, from Eunpyeong.

111
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,440
Wow, you came from so far away. It must be because important people are coming.

112
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,070
Hurry up!

113
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,910
Get in.

114
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,710
That must be it.

115
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,960
In Eunpyeong—

116
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,230
 Go organize the parking lot area.

117
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,860
Roger that.

118
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:14,130

119
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,870
What's this?

120
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,610
- Excuse me.
 - Me?

121
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,900
You can't park here. Please find somewhere else.

122
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,860
I'm sorry. I know, but I'm in a rush to get inside.

123
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,580
I'll find somewhere else to park right after I get back.

124
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,860
I'm really in a rush.

125
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,500
Did you drink?

126
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,680
I didn't.

127
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,290
Can you blow into this?

128
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:43,300
I really didn't. Why? Do I smell?

129
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,600
Oh, I drank yesterday.

130
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,330
Blow into here.

131
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,430
Who are you, from where?

132
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,890
I'm Officer Cha Dong Il from Eunpyeong Police Station.

133
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:57,050
In that case, I will go to the Eunpyeong station and do the test after the award show is over.

134
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,870
That works, right?

135
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,250
Are you being noncompliant?

136
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,220
Happy?

137
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,060
Blood alcohol levels 0.08%.

138
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,960
- Your license will be revoked. 
 - What?

139
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,600
Let's head to the police station.

140
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,730
How does this make any sense? I wasn't drinking!

141
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,200
I drank last night!

142
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,970
Why don't we head over first?

143
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,450
Okay, I understand. But I...

144
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,370
I really need to go in there right now.

145
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,570
I'll really find you after the show. Sorry.

146
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,740
Please stop there. If you leave, you will be arrested for noncompliance.

147
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,690
Officer Cha, didn't you hear?

148
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,950
A VIP guest is coming, we need to be on watch.

149
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,390
- Woo Joo!
 - Oh my gosh!

150
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,730
Why are you so startled?

151
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,080
It's nothing.

152
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,130
Are you nervous?

153
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,700
I'm shaking so much.

154
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,900
Let's go in, it's starting soon.

155
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,640
Let's go.

156
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,120
Hello? Did you find him?

157
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,460
He's not here.

158
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,390
What should we do? Should we report him as missing?

159
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,800
Yes, do that.

160
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,970
Contact the hospital, too.

161
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,560
We can keep looking for him.

162
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,360
Woo Jung, wait a minute!

163
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:12,580
Cha Dong Il... I found him.

164
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,240
What is he doing there?

165
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,100
 Congratulations. Everyone, please give another round of applause.

166
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,760
Next, we have the nominees for Female Rookie of the Year award.

167
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:38,850
This award will be presented by last year's recipient, Jennie Baek.

168
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,830

169
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,970
Hello, I'm Jennie Baek.

170
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,980
I'm nervous to just be presenting this award.

171
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,170
We'll go ahead and meet all the nominees.

172
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,110
Lee Yoon Ha from 'The Court of Hope.'

173
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:18,230
♫  There's no such thing as fate here  ♫

174
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:23,160
♫  All you need is a decision in the moment  ♫

175
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,490
Lee Ji Su from 'Camelot.'

176
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,830
♫  Far away  ♫

177
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:32,870
♫  A new road comes, and my heart...  ♫

178
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,270
♫  It will remain forever  ♫

179
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,190
Choi Seo Yeon from 'Welcome to Transylvania.'

180
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:45,190
♫  I love you too  ♫

181
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:50,360
♫  We have one more thing to do  ♫

182
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,260
Last but not least, Han Woo Joo from 'Dawn'.

183
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,970
♫  Like this country's land,  ♫

184
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,480
♫  Which has all been stolen  ♫

185
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,110
♫  Our fate will follow the same path  ♫

186
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,540
I will present the Rookie of the Year Award.

187
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,300
The 25th Annual Korean Musical Awards. The female Rookie of the Year Award goes to...

188
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,510
Han Woo Joo from 'Dawn.'

189
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,550
 Congratulations.

190
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,930
 Congratulations to Han Woo Joo.

191
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:40,530
 Everything she shows us on stage, from her passion to her beautiful voice, has captivated her audiences.

192
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,920
What's going on? Who is that!

193
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,870
 Can you blow into this?

194
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,940
There must have been a celebratory event planned.

195
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,290
Is this a scene from a musical?

196
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,230
What are you doing right now?

197
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:11,000
For noncompliance to a breathalyzer test,

198
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,190
and for obstruction of government officials,

199
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,330
I am arresting you.

200
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:44,670
 You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

201
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,090
 You have the right to an attorney.

202
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:13,110

203
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:17,480
Hey!

204
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,010
Woo Joo!

205
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,000
Oppa.

206
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,490
What's going on? Is he really a policeman?

207
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,670
She was driving under the influence.

208
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,130
You still shouldn't have—

209
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,100
This is too much! Did you have to do it during the ceremony?

210
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,280
Driving under the influence is a felony.

211
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,740
She was arrested because it was deemed probable she would flee.

212
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,520
Were you really drinking?

213
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,140
I did drink,

214
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,810
but that was last night, not today!

215
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,730
Officer Cha!

216
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,070
What's going on?

217
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:02,440
I've arrested a citizen who was driving under the influence and being noncompliant.

218
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,790
I'm sorry about this.

219
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:09,120
He's a new officer, so he doesn't know much.

220
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,610
I'll apologize on his behalf.

221
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,070
And who are you?

222
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,860
I'm...

223
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,900
- I'm his chief. 
 - What?

224
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,580
It's funny, right. Even if we're the police,

225
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,000
we shouldn't have arrested you during a live show.

226
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,430
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

227
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:36,390
If you go to the police station,

228
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,540
it'll get really complicated.

229
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,020
Let's just...

230
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,840
call it good here.

231
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,600
Let her go. Quickly.

232
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,770
Let her go right now.

233
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:54,420
Undo the cuffs before people come find us.

234
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,820
The reporters will be here any minute.

235
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:01,140
What are you doing! Let her go!

236
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,880
Hurry up.

237
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,450
You are under arrest for posing as a government official.

238
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,890
You have the right to remain silent.

239
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,950
You have the right to an attorney.

240
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,700
What are you guys doing?

241
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,080
He's not a policeman.

242
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,330
What is he, then? Who are you?

243
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,580
He's a doctor.

244
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,280
I'm sorry.

245
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,810
I'm...

246
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,180
a psychiatrist.

247
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,540
I'm his primary doctor.

248
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:58,540
Primary... What do you mean, primary doctor?

249
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,870
To be honest, he...

250
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,210
he's not a policeman.

251
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,530
If he's not a policeman, who is he?

252
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,500
Why did he handcuff me?

253
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,080
He's...

254
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,510
my patient.

255
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,770
Patient? Patient...

256
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:23,890
So you're saying he's crazy?

257
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,330
They're over there!

258
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,480
Han Woo Joo, do you admit to driving under the influence?

259
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,130
What excuses do you have to make?

260
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,010
Is this true?

261
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,640
Were you driving under the influence on your way here?

262
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,080
How do you feel right now?

263
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,470
Did you remain silent?

264
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:46,060
 Han Woo Joo, who won the title of Rookie of the Year at the 25th Korean Musical Awards today,

265
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:50,760
 was arrested for driving under the influence during the ceremony.

266
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,970
 Musical actress arrested during ceremony.

267
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,470
What are we going to do?

268
00:20:54,470 --> 00:21:00,180
Wow, that's so shocking. When did Cha Dong Il get out?

269
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,400
None of us knew, right?

270
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,900
We have no responsibility in this, right?

271
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,390
Didn't they say he would be transferred immediately if he got out again?

272
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:11,370
We'll have to transfer him, then.

273
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,590
Why Woo Joo, of all people?

274
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,270
Do you know her?

275
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:19,100
I don't just know her, we're close.

276
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,560
What should I do?

277
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,370
 Today, musical actress Han Woo Joo was arrested during a live ceremony

278
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,190
 by patient Cha, who has a delusional disorder.

279
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,300
 During the ceremony, patient Cha went up on stage

280
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:37,260
 and handcuffed Han Woo Joo himself,

281
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:43,190
 shocking the audience with his audacity. 
 Aigoo, aigoo!

282
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,190
 Furthermore, patient Cha...

283
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,780
I knew something big would happen soon.

284
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:51,450
 It's been reported he has acted like this in the past.

285
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:55,040
Unnie, are you okay?

286
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,250
So where is Woo Joo right now?

287
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,490
I think she went to the police station.

288
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,670
Can you close the shop for me?

289
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:06,920
It won't do you any good to go right now. You don't even know which station.

290
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,610
Just calm down, and go once she picks up her calls.

291
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:13,130
How did she get caught for driving under the influence?

292
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,370
Does it make sense for someone to get handcuffed and dragged out during a live ceremony?

293
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,580
He's not a real policeman. He's a patient at our hospital.

294
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,730
That's why I'm even more upset!

295
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:25,310
What is your hospital doing? Who was the primary doctor?

296
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:32,200
It's me... I was in charge of that ward.

297
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,570
You! Why would you!

298
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,760
Oh my goodness.

299
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:56,030
You really caused a large problem this time.

300
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:01,340
Does your hospital not keep track of its patients?

301
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,660
You said he has a delusional disorder.

302
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:10,680
The hospital will take full responsibility for this.

303
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,180
I plead for leniency on behalf of the patient.

304
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,680
You can plead for leniency in court.

305
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,050
Forget everything else,

306
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,620
- just take my blood sample. 
 - What?

307
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:26,730
Test me for my blood alcohol levels. This is so unfair!

308
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,060
Don't worry, your license won't be revoked since he was a fake cop.

309
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,400
That's not what's important right now!

310
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,440
Hurry up and test my blood!

311
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,610
Take my blood! Test it!

312
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,520
Hurry up.

313
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,020
- Nothing is showing up. 
 - What?

314
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,410
Is this real...

315
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,670
- It's broken.
 - Broken?

316
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,470
Hey, blow into this.

317
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:16,950
It's definitely broken. No matter who blows into it, it shows 0.08%.

318
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:21,190
So what you're telling me is,

319
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:26,300
this all happened to me because of a fake cop and a broken breathalyzer?

320
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,070
Give me a second.

321
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:51,590
I got tested for driving under the influence, and it tested negative.

322
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,680
Can you publish an article?

323
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:58,380
Say that I wasn't driving under the influence and the breathalyzer was broken.

324
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,300
No, that's not it. What if I did an interview myself?

325
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:07,260
Okay. I have a meeting right now, I'll call you back later.

326
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,590
This is an accident. Just an accident, like a car accident, for example.

327
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,000
I couldn't help it, so I can return everything back to normal.

328
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,130
I wasn't driving under the influence, and it was just an unfortunate incident with a fake cop.

329
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:58,470
 The person you are trying to call...

330
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,960
 Han Woo Joo, are you okay? Where are you?

331
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,800
 Did you see this video?

332
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,890
 Did you really drink?

333
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:19,740
 I did drink, but I drank last night! I didn't drink today!

334
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:25,220
Wait a minute. Why is this...

335
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,310
Driver.

336
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,510
Can you turn this car around?

337
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:39,210
Don't worry about it, he's always been like that.

338
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,060
What do you want to go eat?

339
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,270
Anything you want?

340
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:15,900
Isn't that Han Woo Joo?

341
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:20,030
Stay in the car. Don't come out.

342
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,460
You were a two-timer?

343
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,840
How could someone like me be a two-timer? She's just a close coworker.

344
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,590
- Do you like it? 
 - What are you talking about? She's just a coworker.

345
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:43,570
Not that. Publishing an exclusive article.

346
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:46,810
Does that make you happy, you jerk?

347
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:49,870
You sly bastard.

348
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:54,300
There wasn't anything I could do about it. The team manager...

349
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:12,510
What are you doing? Hey, Han Woo Joo!

350
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,220
 Everyone has a secret basement in their mind.

351
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:37,240
 In there, they hide their secrets.

352
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,640
 Something nobody else knows about.

353
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:47,390
 What do you have hidden inside your basement?

354
00:29:53,460 --> 00:30:00,480

355
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:10,670
♫  Goodbye, the pain I want to send away  ♫

356
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,490
♫  My diary I've pressed away...  ♫

357
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,770

358
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,740
♫  My sadness in  ♫

359
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,450
 - Are you telling me to ditch my patient? 
 - Are you the only doctor here?

360
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,930
 Image is everything for an actress. What does the truth matter?

361
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,170
 Can you please agree to the terms?

362
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:29,920
 Why should I agree to those terms?

363
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,140
 Why did my life become tangled like this?

364
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:35,260
 I just want to live like others do.

365
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,910
 What are you doing here?

366
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:40,090
 Oh Yoo Min said he's your fan.

367
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,150
 Really?

368
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,170
 Yay! Wow!

369
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,280
 Why do you keep treating me like a patient?

370
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,930
 I feel like trash!

371
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,720
 Woo Joo! Come down, that's dangerous!

372
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,160
 - I want to refer a patient to you. 
 - We've already met.

373
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,420
 (Profanity in Korean.)

374
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,500
 Where do you learn that kind of profanity?

375
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,200
♫  So fine  ♫
