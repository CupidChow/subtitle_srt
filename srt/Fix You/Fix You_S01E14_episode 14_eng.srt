1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,720

2
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,270
 The person you are trying to call...

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,030
Is she upset with me?

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:24,370
 Ms. Woo Joo. You know there's theatrical treatment today, right?

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,690
 How did the chicken incident go yesterday?

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,120
Citizens of our nation!

7
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,850
Congressman, you are quite clever.

8
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,270
You even named your precursor symptoms?

9
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,760
Dr. Lee named them for me.

10
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,130
I love you!

11
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,960
This, I came up with.

12
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,300
I know it'll be difficult, but please endure it a bit more.

13
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,010
The medical team at our hospital is trying our very best.

14
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,680
Yes.

15
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,810
Our congressman will be able to attend the hearing, right?

16
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,520
Of course.

17
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,200
Our hospital director is a fan of yours.

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,590
We have to make sure he recovers.

19
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,960
Why are you bringing that up?

20
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,680
- I'm a fan. 
 - Aigoo!

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,250
It's my honor.

22
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:35,010
Then... since you're a fan of mine, can I request a favor of you?

23
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,160
Sure. Please tell me.

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,130
The hospital director wants our hospital

25
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,830
to treat the panic disorders of the subway conductors.

26
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,120
All of a sudden? Why?

27
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,560
Congressmen Koh asked the director himself.

28
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,400
- Himself? 
 - Yes.

29
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,550
The panic disorder of the subway conductors will be about 7 times more severe than that of a normal person.

30
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,960
Dr. In, can you take care of this?

31
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,090
Of course.

32
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:07,120
Congressman Koh takes a particular interest in the working conditions of the subway operators.

33
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,060
Well, there must be a personal reason that we don't know about.

34
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,390
By the way, Dr. Lee,

35
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:18,600
the hospital director says to make sure Congressman Koh is discharged with a full recovery.

36
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,960
It's something our hospital's image depends on, so take particular interest to it.

37
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,260
Even without her insistence, I am working really hard to treat him.

38
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,320
The hearing will not be a problem. The symptoms can temporarily be solved with medication.

39
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,250
We're continuing with the HRT,

40
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,010
and we plan on identifying the source of his stresses through theatrical treatment today.

41
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,490
Okay.

42
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,450
In regard to the panic disorders, put in special effort in doing your research.

43
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,820
- Can you double check the appointment times as well? 
 - Yes.

44
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,360
Anyway, take care.

45
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,780

46
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,670
Mom!

47
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:16,530
This is really overkill. How did you find me here?

48
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,540
I wanted to give this to you.

49
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,830
Did you drink seaweed soup yesterday?

50
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,550
Sure. I'll take this with gratitude since you say you came to give me this.

51
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,120
Mom, why did you quit the shop?

52
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,180
If you've done what you came for, leave so I can work comfortably.

53
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,780
I won't come often.

54
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,440
I'll just come on holidays to give you my greetings.

55
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,690
I just need to know where you are.

56
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,510
If I don't know, I feel uneasy.

57
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,790
I don't like you! I don't even want to see your face!

58
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,380
After I adopted you, nothing turned out well for our family.

59
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,390
My husband's business failed, my mother passed away.

60
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,590
Last time, after you visited, I couldn't even do good business!

61
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,530
Is your lack of business now my fault, too?

62
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,050
I don't want to say these things to you either.

63
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:09,040
So please, let's just not see each other again.

64
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,690
You and I are ill-fated!

65
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,540
How long has it been since I dissolved your adoption? Why do you keep calling me mom?

66
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,660
If you have time to follow me around, go find your biological mother!

67
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,400
Mom, can't you just forgive me now?

68
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,440
I still see fire in my dreams.

69
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,920
I'm living in guilt.

70
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,060
I've already forgiven you for that.

71
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,940
But you were really creepy from the moment I met you!

72
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,640
I thought, "It must be because she was abandoned. It'll be okay if I raise her with love."

73
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:48,100
But that wasn't it. I don't know the reason, but you were just a sick child.

74
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,850
I'm not being like this because of the fire you started.

75
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,580
So stop looking for me and go find your biological parents!

76
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,250
Your bad luck is all because of your biological parents!

77
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,950
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

78
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,890
Did you come find me to throw this tantrum?

79
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,680
Because you wanted to cause a scene in front of me!

80
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,640
I wanted your forgiveness.

81
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,680
I wanted to get your forgiveness!

82
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,960
I wanted to be forgiven!

83
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,740
Don't touch me!

84
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,120
Don't touch me!

85
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,600
You're not in your right mind. You're crazy!

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,840
You're really creepy.

87
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,190
I should've shoved you into a mental asylum earlier.

88
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,510
From the start.

89
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:06,330
You crazy bitch. Crazy!

90
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,980
 The person you are trying to call...

91
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:16,190
What is she doing? Why can't I contact her?

92
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,280
Dr. Lee, welcome.

93
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,620
Are you here to eat?

94
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,690
I came because I couldn't reach Ms. Woo Joo

95
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,730
but it looks like she's not here either.

96
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:32,480
- I haven't heard from Woo Joo since last night. 
 - Is that so?

97
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,040
You said yesterday... that the chicken shop owner changed, right?

98
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,100
Yes.

99
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:44,640
Does Woo Joo have some relationship with that chicken shop?

100
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,490
It's Woo Joo's... adoptive mother's place.

101
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,680
Adoptive mother?

102
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,210
She raised Woo Joo for about 6 years when she was younger.

103
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:57,990
So... when she said the owner changed,

104
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,870
she meant that they moved. Without telling Woo Joo?

105
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,590
That idiot, she said it was her mother's birthday,

106
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,270
so she probably showed up with a bunch of gifts in hand.

107
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,740
I'm sure she drank alone all night and just knocked out.

108
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,480
I'll check if she's at her house later.

109
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,710
Okay, ready?

110
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,170
Okay! Nice!

111
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,580
Nurse Oh!

112
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,830
I want to ask your advice on something.

113
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,710
My advice? What is it?

114
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,650
You heard about Noo Ri Sunbae, right?

115
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,130
I heard she took a leave of absence. Is it serious?

116
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,250
She said it wasn't bothering her, but I think she was just acting tough.

117
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,460
She's prickly but has such a fragile mentality.

118
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:16,680
That's why I wanted to ask... how should we help her?

119
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,880
I thought you weren't on good terms with her.

120
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,990
Wow, that's amazing. You know everything.

121
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,240
Our department knows everything.

122
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,470
There is one thing you can do to help Dr. Kang Noo Ri.

123
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,560
What is it?

124
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,110
 The person you are trying to call...

125
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,340

126
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,460
 You cannot be connected.

127
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,410
 You cannot be connected.

128
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,770

129
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,280
- Hello? 
 - Yes, what is it?

130
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,270
Ms. Woo Joo, where are you?

131
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,800
What is it?

132
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:26,270
I'm calling about the theatrical therapy. Could we meet up soon?

133
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:29,170
- I can't go today. 
 - What?

134
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:34,560
- Ms. Woo Joo... where are you? 
  - I'm at home.

135
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,950
We'll take a quick 15-minute stop at this rest station.

136
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,190
It doesn't sound like you're at home...

137
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,830
I'm going to see my mom.

138
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:46,020
- Where to? 
 - I'll call you later.

139
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:57,260
Ms. Woo Joo said she was going to meet her mother. Do you know where that is?

140
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,930
It seemed like she was on an express bus.

141
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,150
Thank you.

142
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,410
 Do you know what you need most right now?

143
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,570
 A BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) patient.

144
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,170
 I can't stand BPD patients.

145
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,510
 I don't want to meet one ever again.

146
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,220
 How long do you think you can avoid it?

147
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,650
 It's something you'll eventually come across.

148
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:48,200
 You know it yourself. A doctor grows the most with his most difficult patients.

149
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,730
 I've already missed the patient that had given me an opportunity to grow. I don't think I'll get that chance again.

150
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,420
 One day, it'll appear in front of you.

151
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,130
 Someone who will turn you into a great doctor.

152
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,970
I looked for you for a long time!

153
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,000
How did you come here? How did you know?

154
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,130
You said you wanted chicken. I came to eat chicken!

155
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,420
Wow, it's so nice! It's the ocean!

156
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,210
How have you been?

157
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,110
This is where it was?

158
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,700
The ocean where you were on your mother's back?

159
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,370
Yes.

160
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,230
That's why you said you were coming to your mom.

161
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:25,530
This is the only memory I have of my biological mother.

162
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,690
She left me at an orphanage when I was 6.

163
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,610
I have no other memory. I erased them all.

164
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:46,270
I met great adoptive parents,

165
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:51,220
and lead a happy life until I was 12,

166
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,250
but my adoption got dissolved.

167
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:02,420
The chicken shop I told you about yesterday. That was a shop my adoptive mother owned.

168
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,340
She suddenly quit the store, without even telling me.

169
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,200
You know,

170
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,520
there's nothing more upsetting than when a store you were a regular suddenly disappears.

171
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,700
You feel angry and betrayed.

172
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,740
Why aren't you asking me?

173
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,340
Asking you what?

174
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:31,800
Why my adoption was dissolved. Why a kid whose adoption was dissolved is chasing around their adoptive parents.

175
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,780
Why bother remembering memories that probably aren't even that great?

176
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,730
Tell me when you want to, like you're doing right now.

177
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:44,180
That's nice. That you're not asking.

178
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:49,370
Because there will be more to remember in the future, than what you remember now.

179
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,040
Let's... not eat chicken.

180
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,170
I suddenly don't want it anymore.

181
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:04,440
It's all greasy... and makes me worry about my cholesterol, too.

182
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,370
Okay, then.

183
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,400
- What happened to your hand? 
 - Huh? Oh...

184
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,170
How did that happen?

185
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,290
It's nothing.

186
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,430
- But Dr. Lee, do you understand your heart? 
 - What?

187
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,930
I don't understand my feelings.

188
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:38,590
Sometimes I want to see my adoptive mom, but sometimes I dislike her.

189
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:42,400
At least 12 times a day, I feel this then I feel that.

190
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,140
But you know what?

191
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:51,820
Are there people who bring misfortune and horror from birth?

192
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,030
Where on earth is a person like that?

193
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:58,510
Being born in this world is a blessing.

194
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,340
Even abandoned people?

195
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:10,860
As you live, it turns out how you were born doesn't matter at all.

196
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,470
It's how you choose to live that's important.

197
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,770
You don't believe me? Then try living a really good life.

198
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:23,610
Then one day, you'll remember me saying these words.

199
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,020
Wow, what a nice meal. I'm so full.

200
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,500
What is it?

201
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:41,630
- I don't have my car keys. 
 - Look carefully.

202
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,840
I don't have them.

203
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,800
One minute.

204
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,060
- Did you find them? 
 - I don't have them.

205
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:12,090
I must've dropped them while I was looking around for you.

206
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,600
What should I do? Do I need to call the police station?

207
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,920
Why don't we try looking?

208
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,490
In the nighttime?

209
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,900
Ms. Woo Joo. Ms. Woo Joo?

210
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,170
Ms. Woo Joo! Ms. Woo Joo!

211
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:35,980
Ms. Woo Joo!

212
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,230
Ms. Woo Joo!

213
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,400
Han Woo Joo!

214
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,040
I'm right here.

215
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,580
Where were you?

216
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,770
Didn't you hear me calling you? Do you want to see me lose my mind?

217
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,320
Why— Why did you take your shoes off?

218
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,370
I was looking for this.

219
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,020
Where did you find it?

220
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,080
You must've been really worried.

221
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,700
Did you think I had died?

222
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,250
That I had taken my shoes off and jumped into the ocean?

223
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:34,120
♫  As much as I love you  ♫

224
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,240
Put your shoes on so we can go home.

225
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,020
I'm so happy that someone worries about me so much.

226
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,720
- Hurry up and put them on. 
 - I'm so happy.

227
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,200
♫   As much as I want you,  ♫

228
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:56,760
♫  I wish you wanted me.  ♫

229
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:03,810
♫  I'm looking at you like this.  ♫

230
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:12,940
♫  Where are you looking?   ♫

231
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:17,620
♫  Can't you look at me?  ♫

232
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,750
How did you find it?

233
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,370
I just saw it.

234
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,140
Like a miracle.

235
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:34,770
♫  I'm right here looking at you.  ♫

236
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:38,890
♫  Like a fool, like this,  ♫

237
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:42,670
♫  I only look at you.  ♫

238
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:49,400
♫  Why are you acting like you don't know?  ♫

239
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,130
Excuse me. This is all I have to give you.

240
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,560
No worries. Thank you.

241
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,050
Please, have a seat.

242
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:44,020
Do you sleep here, just like this?

243
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:48,590
Yes. We have no choice if we want to get ready for the first train tomorrow.

244
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:52,520
We have to get up an hour before the first trains start running to inspect them.

245
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:57,690
I heard that you were looking to help us?

246
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:02,210
Yes. I came because there were a few things I wanted to ask you before we began treatment.

247
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:08,820
I heard there was an accident about a month ago.

248
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,450
Was that because of the panic disorders?

249
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,580
Oh, that accident?

250
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,030
He felt like he was going to lose his mind,

251
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:57,260
so he just stopped the train and bolted outside.

252
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,970
But the train coming from the opposite side...

253
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:12,560
We work all alone, so if something like that happens, there's nothing we can do about it.

254
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,390
Then have you also...

255
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:21,180
Yes. I've been diagnosed with a panic disorder.

256
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:26,410
The symptoms start to show even if I so much as get into the train.

257
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,530
My life is on a time limit, I suppose.

258
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:36,100
Panic disorders can be fully cured. We will help you.

259
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:41,080
Why is such a large hospital helping us?

260
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,310
We're all doctors. Do we need any other reason?

261
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,890
- Thank you. 
 - Please, don't mention it.

262
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,500
I'll head out now.

263
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,520
Oh, sure. Give that to me, I'll clean it up.

264
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,630
Thank you for the tea.

265
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,140
Isn't this Congressman Ko Sang Mo in the middle of this picture?

266
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:14,620
It is. He's the congressman who is the most concerned about the quality of the work life for train operators like us.

267
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:18,340
Is the person next to him also a train operator?

268
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,530
The person that passed away recently...

269
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,620
That's him.

270
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,760
Did you wait long?

271
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,830
No. I just got here.

272
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,800
Why do you have nothing in your fridge?

273
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,440
Do you only drink? Don't you cook?

274
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,110
I eat food at your restaurant.

275
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,180
You seem fine.

276
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,710
Didn't something happen with your adoptive mother?

277
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:58,620
I really thought I was going to die, but Dr. Lee Si Joon made me feel better.

278
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:02,220
He's good at treating you. He even went to the ocean with you.

279
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,460
He really worries a lot about me.

280
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,070
Why do you think he's so good to me?

281
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,830
Of course because he's a doctor and you're his patient?

282
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:15,320
- Nope! It's more than that. He is interested in me. 
 - I don't think that's it.

283
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,900
It's true.

284
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:21,290
I heard from Ji Hee that Dr. Lee

285
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:24,390
- doesn't just meet his patients in his office. 
 - Yup.

286
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:28,360
So he goes wherever his patients go, and...

287
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,300
Even Cha Dong Il, that fake cop?

288
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,570
He used to go on rounds with him.

289
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,300
I know!

290
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,450
He goes on walks, too.

291
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:40,010
Didn't he go to the  dumpsters and throw your watch away with you?

292
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,090
That's Dr. Lee's treatment method.

293
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,780
I know that too, but

294
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,370
I saw his truth today.

295
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:54,290
He... thinks of me as special.

296
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:58,970
I heard... that patients who see a psychiatrist

297
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:03,900
often mistake their doctor's goodwill as something else,

298
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,880
since they're such good listeners and kind people.

299
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,410
I'm not misunderstanding anything.

300
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,990
- Woo Joo. 
 - Yes?

301
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:28,480
Did you know that Dr. Ji Young Won introduced you to Dr. Lee Si Joon?

302
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,840
What does that mean?

303
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,240
Why would Dr. Ji introduce me to him? Who said that?

304
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,310
I heard it myself.

305
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:37,740
When a doctor introduces a patient to another doctor,

306
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,610
don't you think there's only one reason for that?

307
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:52,310
If you're really special to Dr. Lee Si Joon, don't you think it's because of that?

308
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:00,720
Congressman Koh made a proposal for the Seoul train operators quality of work,

309
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,340
but they said they never followed the rule for working in pairs, per the expected excuses.

310
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:10,340
So someone became a victim of the one-man regulations.

311
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:14,530
Because of that, Congressman Koh is caught up in guilt.

312
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:17,250
That caused tremendous amounts of stress.

313
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,060
Then once Congressman Koh's guilt goes away, so will his tic.

314
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,310
How could that go away? That person... is already dead.

315
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:28,440
Don't you think it'll go away if the promise to work in pairs is kept?

316
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,960
That's true, but that's not something that'll be changed in a day or two.

317
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,640
Did you call it HRT?

318
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:49,620
It must have been because of that, but my condition has gotten a lot better.

319
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,480
It's just a temporary solution caused by the medication.

320
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,260
Then if I don't use the medication, it'll return?

321
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:03,350
I... think I figured out the cause of your tic symptoms.

322
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,400
Is that true?

323
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:15,040
Do you remember this man?

324
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,570
There is a line that is called "The Hell of the Subway" amongst the operators.

325
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:33,010
The darkness is endless,

326
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:38,690
and they've even peed their pants because they couldn't use the restroom.

327
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,460
That pained me to hear.

328
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:48,050
So you promised him that you would mandate a rule for train operators to work in pairs.

329
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:53,690
In the time that your promise was not fulfilled, that operator passed away.

330
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:58,820
All of it seemed like my fault.

331
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,270
Shall I get you some more medication?

332
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,960
No, I'm okay.

333
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:19,990
Now that I'm thinking of that operator, this Citizens of our nation is acting up again.

334
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:32,490
The person that can help you fix your condition is not me,

335
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,810
but yourself.

336
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:40,010
Of course, we can continue using medication to alleviate the symptoms.

337
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,990
However, that's only temporary.

338
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:45,300
Real treatment...

339
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,990
can only be done by yourself.

340
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,040
Ms. Han Woo Joo has a consultation at 4, right?

341
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,140
What did you want to check with me?

342
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:35,330
I heard you introduced me to Dr. Lee Si Joon.

343
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:37,530
No, I didn't introduce you, but—

344
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:40,410
What kind of disease do I have?

345
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:45,900
I mean, how bad is it that you had to send me to someone else?

346
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,270
Why did you introduce me to Lee Si Joon?

347
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:04,660

348
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,480
♫  I'm fine.  ♫

349
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,390
♫  I'm so fine.  ♫

350
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:14,560

351
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,270
 You abandoned me!

352
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:19,450
 I think she'll become more attached to you out of her anger towards me.

353
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,900
 I think it's fate that we met.

354
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,290
 To tell someone who experiences panic disorders almost every day to keep holding on to the steering wheel instead of coming to the hospital.

355
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,390
 Does that— Does that even make any sense?

356
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,860
 Are you turning into Lee Si Joon?

357
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,630
 At least for panic disorders, I want to follow Si Joon's methods.

358
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,460
 She links arms with him? At the hospital?

359
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,930
 This is fate, and it must be fate.

360
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:40,260
 We can't live as cowards because of our anxiety.

361
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,410
 The patient that's in charge of theatrical therapy.

362
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:44,730
 Tell her to quit immediately.
