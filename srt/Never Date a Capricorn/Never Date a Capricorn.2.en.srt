1
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:19,250
Feeling better today?

2
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:23,791
After resting for two days, I'm much better.

3
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:28,958
I feel like

4
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,291
I'm pretty useless.

5
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:33,291
Always needing your help with everything.

6
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:38,291
Everyone needs help from others sometimes.

7
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,041
What about you?

8
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,458
You Capricorns,

9
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,750
do you ever need help from others?

10
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:49,833
I don't know about others.

11
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,250
I'm just

12
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54,666
used to relying on myself.

13
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,041
Doesn't it get tiring after a while?

14
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:03,208
Do you have close friends or...

15
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:04,125
Sure.

16
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,708
Good friends, I have some.

17
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:11,541
But not the kind you're talking about.

18
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:16,000
What kind am I talking about?

19
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,750
Hey, do Capricorns

20
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:28,416
refuse to admit when they're being nice to someone?

21
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,916
What else?

22
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,958
What else? What else is there...?

23
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:35,833
What other traits do Capricorns have?

24
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,625
Says one thing but means another.

25
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:42,125
Slow to warm up, cold and aloof.

26
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:57,416
Don't forget your medicine.

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,791
Cheng Hai.

28
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,416
Cheng Hai, I made breakfast.

29
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,666
Let's eat together.

30
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,458
Made specially for me?

31
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,583
No...

32
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:49,250
Not specially, just made some extra while I was at it.

33
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:53,833
Quite convenient.

34
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,583
I'm heading to work.

35
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,750
You're in such a rush today?

36
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,333
I saw you working until 4:30 AM last night.

37
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,541
If you keep this up, you'll ruin your health.

38
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,875
There's a difficult project at work recently.

39
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:15,000
Once this busy period is over, I'll be fine. Don't worry.

40
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,458
Wait, let's go out together.

41
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:21,000
I'll go in early

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,708
to catch up on my work.

43
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:23,500
Okay.

44
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:47,708
Cheng Hai.

45
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,833
What's wrong?

46
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,250
Oh, I'm fine.

47
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,541
The cup just accidentally fell.

48
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,958
It's okay, go back to your room.

49
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,500
Cheng Hai, if something's wrong

50
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,416
or if you're not feeling well,

51
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:07,791
you can tell me.

52
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:09,750
I said I'm fine.

53
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,833
Leave me alone.

54
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,083
Talk to me about it.

55
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,541
Maybe I can help.

56
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,916
You're so annoying!

57
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,333
I said leave me alone!

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,916
Sorry.

59
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,250
It's the company project.

60
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,416
Our team has been working overtime for a month straight.

61
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,416
The contract was about to be signed,

62
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,958
but then the client's entire project got cancelled.

63
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,625
At work,

64
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,791
these things are sometimes hard to avoid.

65
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,583
It's not just your fault.

66
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:03,125
But I was the one leading this project.

67
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,291
And the company invested a lot in development costs.

68
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,833
No one can be perfect all the time.

69
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,083
Try to let it go.

70
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:15,500
Even if

71
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,875
you get fired,

72
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,250
when you come home,

73
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,125
I'll still be here.

74
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,166
Try it.

75
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:56,833
Might be a bit sweet.

76
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,541
It's fine.

77
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,166
Cheng Hai.

78
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,041
From now on, whatever happens,

79
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,458
let's face it together.

80
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,166
Okay?

81
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,083
Maybe for life matters.

82
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,666
But for work,

83
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,083
I can only rely on myself.

84
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,416
I understand.

85
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,375
But sometimes,

86
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,875
if you try to open up a bit more,

87
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,000
many things might become easier.

88
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,375
You mean I need to depend on others?

89
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,166
Not depend, but share.

90
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,416
You can try talking about anything.

91
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:06,916
Don't bear it all alone.

92
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:20,500
Thank you.

93
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,250
You're welcome.

94
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,333
Whether it's sharing or depending,

95
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,833
as long as it makes you happy,

96
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,875
it's all good.

97
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:34,625
Mm.

98
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:52,916
I'm back.

99
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,958
Cheng Hai, who is this person?

100
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,333
Your friend?

101
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,125
An old friend.

102
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,000
Not important.

103
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,833
This person must be

104
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,375
important to you.

105
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:38,791
Past things

106
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,500
aren't worth mentioning.

107
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,041
Still thinking about the photo?

108
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,000
No, just wanted some time alone.

109
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,375
It's okay.

110
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,666
If you want to ask, just ask.

111
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,666
Don't keep it bottled up.

112
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:49,875
That person...

113
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,750
Left you a long time ago?

114
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:01,708
Yes.

115
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:06,750
Why didn't you

116
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,666
stay together?

117
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,166
Some people

118
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,208
are destined to be just passing through.

119
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,583
Past wounds

120
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,458
just become memories.

121
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,458
But he

122
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,416
still left traces.

123
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,541
The past is the past.

124
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,500
People have to move forward, don't they?

125
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,291
So have you made peace

126
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,166
with the past?

127
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,166
Of course.

128
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,625
I'm already looking forward to my future.

129
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,791
Mm.

130
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,625
Hey,

131
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,250
you Capricorns

132
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,000
are really hard to get close to.

133
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,291
Not really.

134
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,750
I always feel like

135
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,250
there's a wall in your heart.

136
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,416
It keeps people at a distance

137
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,500
and you won't easily express your thoughts.

138
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:48,208
Come on.

139
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,625
You're overthinking.

140
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:53,958
Besides,

141
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,916
saying it or not saying it,

142
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,291
is it really that important?

143
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,583
Then what's most important?

144
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:02,541
Feelings.

145
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,041
Feelings are what matter most.

146
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,458
Words from others might be lies,

147
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,916
but your own feelings

148
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,625
are definitely the most real.

149
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,208
Let's drink to that.
