1
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:12,416
Take a break, have a drink

2
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,125
Relax a bit

3
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:17,083
You'll work more efficiently

4
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:21,958
I didn't expect you'd actually ask me to drink

5
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:25,000
If I get drunk, you'll have to take care of me

6
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,375
I'm just

7
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,666
giving you some crash training on your alcohol tolerance

8
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,916
You still haven't answered my question

9
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:53,666
This liquor is strong

10
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:57,958
If you're not used to it

11
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,750
just drink slowly

12
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:10,916
Today

13
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:14,375
I really need something strong

14
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:20,125
So you're still choosing

15
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:22,958
not to answer my question?

16
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:31,708
I already told you

17
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,833
Words can lie

18
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:40,041
Why don't you trust your own feelings?

19
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,333
Then

20
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,916
do you think my feelings right now

21
00:01:58,958 --> 00:01:59,916
are right?

22
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,708
That

23
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,916
you have to ask yourself

24
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,333
You

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,500
You Capricorn

26
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,208
If you insist on an answer

27
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,666
All I can say is

28
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,041
Capricorn

29
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,208
is like this liquor

30
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:44,666
Strong at first

31
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,625
But it gets you comfortably drunk

32
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:05,583
Cheng Hai

33
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:10,208
If you weren't this cold to everyone

34
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,583
I would've been angry already

35
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,000
Am I cold?

36
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,791
Freezing cold

37
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,166
So cold I want to stay away from you

38
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,416
I thought

39
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,458
we're already pretty close

40
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:46,500
Still

41
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,083
not close enough

42
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:56,666
Ye Chengyun

43
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,041
You're not drunk, are you?

44
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,750
Why are you always like this

45
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,750
You know everything

46
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,166
I got it

47
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,291
Come if you want

48
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,208
Come on

49
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,625
What do you mean?

50
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:38,583
Come

51
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,375
Come closer

52
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:54,833
Is

53
00:04:58,625 --> 00:04:59,750
Is this what you mean?

54
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,666
Cheng Hai

55
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,125
What's wrong?

56
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,375
Don't want it anymore?

57
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,125
No

58
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,583
I... I'm just a little

59
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,125
A little uncertain

60
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:49,916
I don't know

61
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,458
I've never had a boyfriend

62
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,833
I'm a bit nervous

63
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,541
It's okay

64
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,458
If you don't want to

65
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,083
Don't force yourself

66
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,041
Won't you regret it?

67
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:25,916
I won't

68
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,208
Cheng Hai

69
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,458
You won't leave me, right?

70
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,708
Hello, is Cheng Hai here?

71
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,583
You are...?

72
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:19,708
Oh, I'm Yu Min

73
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:20,833
Cheng Hai's friend

74
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:24,791
Friend

75
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,291
Yes

76
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,083
A friend who hasn't seen him in three years

77
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,541
Why are you here?

78
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,375
Cheng Hai, long time no see

79
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,041
Didn't you leave?

80
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,375
Why are you back?

81
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,833
I came back in March

82
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,291
I applied for a posting to Japan

83
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:58,208
I was passing by today and thought I'd drop by

84
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,458
Is it convenient?

85
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,541
Thank you

86
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,000
Still as busy as always?

87
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:27,958
Yeah

88
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,000
You appearing so suddenly...

89
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:34,916
How have you been lately?

90
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,375
Not bad. I'm not particularly busy

91
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,875
It's just when I'm back in Japan

92
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,625
I kind of miss you

93
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,916
Actually, I don't live far from here

94
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,500
About 10 minutes by car

95
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,458
After all this time

96
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,625
Thank you

97
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,958
for still thinking of me

98
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,625
Never forgot

99
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,791
Last time was the day we broke up, wasn't it?

100
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,125
That was a long time ago

101
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,000
Looks like you're doing well lately

102
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,666
With a roommate taking care of you

103
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,708
Don't say that

104
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:57,958
Your favorite whiskey

105
00:09:58,583 --> 00:09:59,666
Don't mind, right?

106
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:12,500
Here

107
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,458
Dried fish

108
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,041
Goes with the drink

109
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:21,625
Thanks

110
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,458
Join us

111
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,625
Try this liquor

112
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,333
It's quite good

113
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,291
Convince Cheng Hai

114
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,583
Let's have a drink together

115
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,541
No need to convince

116
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,541
Cheng Hai, you really haven't changed at all

117
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,833
Still so cold to me

118
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,708
I'll go to my room

119
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,625
Stay

120
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,708
Looks like you two are really in sync

121
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,833
What exactly do you want to say?

122
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:45,791
I just want to say

123
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,208
I regret it

124
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:53,916
Three years

125
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,875
How did you manage it?

126
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,541
Not replying to a single message

127
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,250
Let the past be the past

128
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:14,791
I waited three years

129
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,416
Finally got another chance to come back

130
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,000
To your past

131
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:46,750
Looks like your roommate

132
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,625
really cares about your past

133
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:51,875
It's none of your business

134
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,291
Cheng Hai

135
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,083
You're always afraid to face feelings

136
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,000
With me like this

137
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,916
With him too

138
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,916
Always running away

139
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,291
Never daring to express the love in your heart

140
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,875
This is between him and me

141
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,083
You don't need to comment

142
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:15,750
Fine

143
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,333
After all these years, I've let go

144
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,000
But young people nowadays are different

145
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:23,958
I think

146
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,208
He really needs those words of love from you

147
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,125
Let's leave it here today

148
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,833
I'll visit again when I have the chance

149
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,375
Are you okay?

150
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,083
You seem unhappy

151
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:21,625
No

152
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,375
Some things I don't say

153
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,875
because there's no need to

154
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,750
Just tell me

155
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,041
Am I important to you?

156
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:56,458
What do you think?

157
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,375
You have to say it

158
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:07,958
Fine

159
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,500
Then I'll tell you

160
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,541
Important

161
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,125
Very important

162
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,666
I've never liked someone this much

163
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,458
Until I met you

164
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,166
From now on

165
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,416
You belong only to me

166
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:45,541
Then

167
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,083
Do you belong to me too?
