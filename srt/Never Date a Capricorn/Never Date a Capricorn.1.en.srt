00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,833
Cheng Hai

2
00:00:06,291 --> 00:00:07,708
What's wrong with the water?

3
00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:09,166
What's the matter?

4
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:12,416
Still no hot water

5
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:19,291
No hot water?

6
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:21,250
The water heater seems broken

7
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:37,958
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

8
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:41,875
Hey

9
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:43,458
Stop it

10
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,541
Hey, stop, stop

11
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,500
Never date a Capricorn

12
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:51,958
Everyone says so

13
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,541
Because Capricorns love you

14
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:56,208
But they love themselves more

15
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,041
Slow to warm up, cold

16
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,000
Don't like replying to messages

17
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:02,583
Want you to be obsessed with them

18
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:05,041
But they always seem indifferent

19
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:08,791
But unfortunately

20
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,666
I am a Capricorn myself

21
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:13,708
Well

22
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,625
What can I say? Capricorns may not say it

23
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:19,750
But they care in their hearts

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We're better at expressing emotions through details

25
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:26,208
What are you saying?

26
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:29,750
Capricorns are also good friends to humanity

27
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,583
Oh, hello

28
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:49,250
You're Ye Chengyun?

29
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:50,333
Yes

30
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:53,250
Um, I was referred by Leo

31
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,291
Sorry to bother you

32
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:55,333
I know

33
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,041
Come in

34
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:04,875
Your room?

35
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,166
It's the second bedroom upstairs

36
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,291
There's only one bathroom

37
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,416
We'll share it

38
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:10,250
Oh

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,916
You can get familiar with the rest

40
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,708
Ask me if you have any questions

41
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:16,875
Okay

42
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,625
You're not going to cook every day, are you?

43
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,416
Not every day

44
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,083
If you don't like the smell of cooking

45
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,791
I can just have sandwiches or salads

46
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,250
No need for that

47
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,916
Don't you usually cook?

48
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,833
No, too troublesome

49
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,416
It'll be ready soon

50
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,500
Consider it a thank you for letting me share the rent

51
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:35,500
Sounds good

52
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,541
How is it?

53
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:06,708
Hmm

54
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:08,500
Delicious

55
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:11,958
Have more

56
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,958
Are you usually busy?

57
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:33,833
Busy

58
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,458
And you? Just graduated?

59
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,333
Yes

60
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,458
Just graduated

61
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,333
I got a job as a design assistant

62
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,833
Tomorrow's my first day

63
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,208
A bit nervous

64
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,291
You'll get used to it after working for a while

65
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,041
Yeah

66
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,875
Thanks for today

67
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,666
Your cooking is really good

68
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,958
You're welcome. We can eat together from now on

69
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,541
Great

70
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,458
Just not sure if our schedules will match for meals

71
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:13,958
We'll see

72
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:15,333
Okay

73
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,166
By the way

74
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,583
Do you have a girlfriend?

75
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:22,916
Girlfriend?

76
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,291
I don't mean anything by it

77
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,833
Just worried you'd bring someone home

78
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,916
Male or female, I'd find it awkward

79
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:37,416
So

80
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,375
No, no

81
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,833
No girlfriend or

82
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,250
no boyfriend?

83
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,125
Neither girlfriend nor boyfriend

84
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,125
If you do, just go to a hotel

85
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,000
Hey, what? I still...

86
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,708
I still think work is most important

87
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,375
Work is most important

88
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,041
Oh, right

89
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,833
What's your zodiac sign?

90
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,666
Capricorn. Why?

91
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,000
So why don't even dogs date Capricorns?

92
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,416
I've summarized 4 reasons

93
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,750
Capricorns are a bit insecure

94
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,375
So they're champions of being tough outside, soft inside

95
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,083
If you don't take initiative, nothing happens

96
00:06:59,083 --> 00:06:59,916
If you do?

97
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,083
Capricorns find it annoying

98
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,458
Low-level people shouldn't pursue Capricorns

99
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,708
They're a bit appearance-focused, love at first sight...

100
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,291
Weekend and still working overtime

101
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,916
I... the client wants a draft urgently

102
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,500
No matter how I revise it, it's not right

103
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,541
This is way too complicated

104
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,833
Clients want to see key points

105
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,333
Not a pile of details

106
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,791
You know design too?

107
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,333
No

108
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,833
But I've seen too many similar PPTs

109
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:51,750
So how would you revise this?

110
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,583
Simplify to the main framework first

111
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,500
Once the framework is solid, then add details

112
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,833
Okay, I'll try that

113
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,291
Smells great! I thought you don't cook

114
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:39,208
My mom sent marinated meat, I cut some

115
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,625
Made two lunch boxes

116
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,166
Remember to take one to work tomorrow

117
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,750
Okay, thanks

118
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:22,625
Cheng Hai

119
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,708
What's wrong?

120
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,500
Thank you for today

121
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,166
Your lunch box

122
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:34,875
I'm really grateful

123
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,083
Go to sleep early

124
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,291
Cheng Hai

125
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,166
The fridge seems broken

126
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,125
Cheng Hai

127
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,458
Everything inside seems spoiled

128
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:27,708
Probably

129
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,208
This fridge has been used for a long time

130
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,041
Maybe the compressor is broken

131
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,291
Let's take everything out first

132
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,958
Cook what's still edible

133
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,625
What can't be eaten

134
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,125
Just throw it away

135
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,041
Wait, no, no

136
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,333
This is yogurt I just bought two days ago

137
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,041
It was quite expensive

138
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:56,166
It's probably spoiled, don't eat it

139
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,250
Wait for me

140
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:16,958
It's yogurt

141
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,458
It's supposed to be sour

142
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:21,625
It's fine

143
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,125
Here

144
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,208
Make do with this for now

145
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,416
You went out to buy yogurt?

146
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:53,958
I went to buy instant noodles

147
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,541
I saw the supermarket was about to close

148
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,375
We can't go hungry today

149
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:06,375
Thanks

150
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,291
Cheng Hai

151
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:51,958
Cheng Hai

152
00:13:59,041 --> 00:13:59,750
Cheng Hai

153
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,083
What's wrong?

154
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,916
I think I have a fever

155
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,000
Fever?

156
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:11,458
I think so

157
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,916
Yesterday's yogurt

158
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,833
Was really spoiled

159
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:18,333
You ate the spoiled yogurt?

160
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,041
Ah

161
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,916
Come on, let's go downstairs

162
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,833
Come

163
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,250
Come, lie down

164
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,000
Wait a moment

165
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,291
Here

166
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,166
That's it

167
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,583
Take this medicine first

168
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,375
After taking medicine, we still need to observe

169
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,708
If it doesn't get better, we'll have to go to the hospital

170
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,000
Okay

171
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,583
I'll listen to you

172
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,458
You're making porridge?

173
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,541
You're awake?

174
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:13,875
Millet porridge

175
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,291
It's good for sick people

176
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,375
You stayed up all night

177
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,958
taking care of me

178
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,875
I threw away everything left in the fridge

179
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,250
Someone will come to repair it this afternoon

180
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,500
I'll bring some food back tonight
