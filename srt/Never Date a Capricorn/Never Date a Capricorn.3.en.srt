1
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:40,708
Cheng Hai

2
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:43,833
Cheng Hai

3
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:48,083
You always keep everything to yourself

4
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,625
What difference would it make if I told you?

5
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:56,666
At least I'd know if you need me

6
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,333
You never say anything

7
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,916
I don't even know if I matter

8
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:03,166
to you at all

9
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:07,833
Does it really matter

10
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:09,833
whether I say it or not?

11
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:13,500
Yes

12
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:41,958
Why are you still up so late?

13
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:47,541
Can't sleep

14
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:53,833
What are you thinking about?

15
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:58,958
Just some things

16
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,833
from the past

17
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,833
and the future

18
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:08,916
Important things?

19
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:13,833
I guess so

20
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,333
But thinking won't help

21
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,208
It's not just up to me anyway

22
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:35,083
The past is already gone

23
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,416
Can we talk about the future?

24
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,833
Do you always want to know everyone's future?

25
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:47,708
No

26
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,041
I only want to know your future

27
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,583
What do you want to know about my future?

28
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,166
I want to know

29
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:05,333
if I'm in your future

30
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,083
It's late

31
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:38,833
Get some rest

32
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,750
Work tomorrow

33
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,750
We're almost there

34
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,708
You're Cheng Hai, right?

35
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,541
I'm his colleague

36
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,666
Company gathering tonight

37
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,166
He had a bit too much

38
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:20,541
Thanks

39
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,750
Sorry for the trouble

40
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,583
No problem

41
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,750
The whole way here

42
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,583
he kept calling your name

43
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:31,791
I think

44
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,666
you must be the person he trusts most

45
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,833
I'll leave him with you

46
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:38,833
Goodbye

47
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,625
Thanks for your help

48
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:41,625
No worries

49
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:48,458
Come on

50
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,916
How did you get this drunk?

51
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,791
Cheng Hai

52
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,166
Cheng Hai

53
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,833
I'm here, stop calling

54
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,291
Come on, sober up a bit

55
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,458
You're home now

56
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,416
Cheng Hai

57
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,250
What is it?

58
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:16,958
Do you

59
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,208
hate me?

60
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,333
What are you talking about?

61
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,791
You're always so cold

62
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:34,166
I... I don't know what to do

63
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:40,958
I... I don't know how to treat you

64
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,958
Treat me however you want

65
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,583
Just do what feels right

66
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:00,833
What's wrong?

67
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,208
Then

68
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,083
Then

69
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,458
I want you to

70
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:12,458
I want you to call me

71
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,666
darling

72
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,875
You... you won't respond again

73
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,791
Oh

74
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,041
I'm so sad

75
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:40,458
You

76
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,583
Can't you people

77
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,291
just say you like someone?

78
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:54,333
Can't you just say you like me?

79
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,583
What nonsense are you talking?

80
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,333
Cheng Hai

81
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,291
Mm, I'm here

82
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,416
Let's

83
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,916
be together

84
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,541
Okay?

85
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,166
Together

86
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,833
Let's be together

87
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:01,708
Good

88
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:03,958
Together

89
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:05,333
Sleep now

90
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,916
Together

91
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:47,833
Awake?

92
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,583
I... last night I...

93
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,208
You drank too much. It's fine

94
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,833
Have some congee while it's hot

95
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,666
Drink less at company gatherings

96
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,291
Having someone bring you home

97
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,416
It's quite troublesome

98
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:18,708
Sorry

99
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:25,166
Next time you want to drink, send me a message first

100
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,250
I'll pick you up

101
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Okay

102
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:46,875
Hello, Brother Bai

103
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,833
Ah, I'm fine now

104
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,250
I drank too much yesterday. Thanks for bringing me home

105
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,125
Yeah, okay, good

106
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,708
See you at work tomorrow

107
00:12:58,708 --> 00:12:59,541
Okay

108
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,250
You two seem pretty close

109
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,083
Huh?

110
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,416
Nothing, just regular colleagues

111
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,041
He was just checking in

112
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:20,625
Really?

113
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,166
Yeah

114
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,541
Really?

115
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:27,750
Really!

116
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,125
Oh
