Okay.

This man's son is a humanoid

17
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,790
that Sheen Genome Institute investigated last week.

18
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,550
The man was busy at work

19
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,970
and always out of town.

20
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,410
He didn't even have time

21
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,220
to come back to be present during childbirth.

22
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:51,760
He felt guilty.

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,670
That's why

24
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,990
he loved his wife and his only son

25
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,570
very much.

26
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:59,320
Director Wan,

27
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,000
You said

28
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,080
he couldn't even be present during childbirth.

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,860
But his son was found out

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,690
to be humanoid, wasn't he?

31
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,490
In fact, his son died

32
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,289
right when he was born.

33
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:12,660
It was because of his wife's negligence.

34
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,580
His wife hid it

35
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,030
and bought a humanoid child as their son.

36
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,170
So how was his son

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,520
found out to be a humanoid?

38
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,820
Last week, his wife went out with the kid

39
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,930
and had an accident.

40
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,220
That's when it was discovered.

41
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,130
You've passed the first round

and are all capable.

43
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,050
What we need to do now

44
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,820
is to inform him of the whole thing

45
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,130
without hurting him.

46
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,280
Do you have any good ideas?

49

In the hospital.

50
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,320
She's been in a coma for a few days.

51
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,700
She just woke up last night.

52
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,520
You can start when you're ready.

53

Mr. Fang.

56
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,329
I think it needs to be

57
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:49,880
a little more stimulating.

58
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,950
What did you do?

59
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,100
I just thought

60
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,650
if I were him,

61
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,540
what would I think now?

62
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,160
A normal person's first reaction

63
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,380
would be outraged.

64
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,890
He'd hate his wife for killing his son

65
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,030
and buying a humanoid

66
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,800
to hide her mistake.

67
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,520
I told him

68
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,360
his wife

69
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,580
must hate herself more compared to him.

70
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,630
She's lived in the pain of losing her son

71
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,430
and in the guilt of deceiving her husband.

72
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,560
No one

73
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,650
is more painful than a mother who loses her child.

74
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,030
But she chose to bear everything.

75
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,520
She didn't want the family to be destroyed.

76
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,360
So she bought the humanoid.

77
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,300
Although he lost his son,

78
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,200
he still has a wife

79
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,270
who loves him deeply.

80
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,510
That's all.

I'm surprised

84
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,130
why you know so much

85
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,150
about the feelings of the victim.

86
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,000
I just tried to put myself in their shoes.

To be honest,

88
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,520
something happened to my family too

I'm still learning how to face it

00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,590
until now.

00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,480

93
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,660

110
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:50,720
Director,

111
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,510
I think Chen Xinhui's case

112
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,720
remains suspicious.

113
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:55,520
What do you mean?

114
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,409
After the murderer killed Chen Xinhui,

115
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,520
he carefully decorated the scene.

116
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,090
This sense of ritual

117
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,120
is like an autograph.

118
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,320
I don't think he just wanted

119
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,560
the pleasure of killing.

120
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,000
It's more like a psychological need.

121
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:10,980
So I think

122
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,670
he'll conduct another murder.

123
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,150
You mean a serial murder case?

124
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,190
I think he left such a pattern at the scene

125
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,900
to express something.

126

What do you think?

128
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,900
What does this have to do with us?

129
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,070
Of course, the serial murder case

130
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,390
has nothing to do with us.

131
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,290
But if the killer only kills humanoids,

132
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,910
that'll be a different story.

133
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,010
The murderer

134
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,659
made Shen Li still lying in the hospital bed.

135
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,920
Don't you want to arrest him?

136
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:42,200
I forgot

137
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,430
you made Shen Li lying in the hospital bed.

138
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,480
There should at least be three victims

139

in a serial murder case.

140
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:50,530
Where's your evidence?

141
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,270
I'll find it.

142
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:52,950
Really?

143
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,880
When?

144
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,230
All right, we have to find the evidence.

145
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,940
But you can't let go of the case in your hand.

I'll handle it myself.

150
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,980
Don't you know?

151
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,660
You need two investigators' signatures

on the survey report.

153
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,760
In other words,

154
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,140
if I don't sign it,

155
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,760

I want this.

176
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,670
The song

177
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,310
was good.

178
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,440
Really? Thank you.

179
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,460
Actually, this song

180
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,130
is my wife's favorite.

181
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,560
I practice it secretly when I'm free,

182
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,990
so I can sing for her

183
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,980
when I have the chance.

184
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:53,970
So romantic.

185
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,110
Is this sculpture

186
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,130
a work of Jin Yan?

187
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,580
Do you know her?

188
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,160
I like her very much.

189
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,280
She's an amazing artist.

190
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,840
Really?

191
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,670
I have several of her sculptures in my shop.

192
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,350
This one.

193
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,690
There, there.

194
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,990
Everyone has different opinions on sculptures.

195
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,130
What do you think about this?

196
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,200
I think

197
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,800
it looks like someone struggling.

198
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,550
Really?

199
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,140
Why do I feel

200
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,410
it looks relaxed?

201
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,710
Boss, do you know Jin Yan?

202
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,910
Yes.

203
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,130
She has shares in this bar too.

204
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,700
What kind of person is she?

205
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,290
She is...

206

She's a good person.

It's okay.

-I want to go home.
-Let me give you a ride.

215

No need. I can go back by myself.

it's about a defective beauty.

What are you doing?

349
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,310
Leave.

350
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,580
I still think

351
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,970
you're so strange.

352
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,800
You have such a good temper.

353
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,400
Are you not angry

354
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,500
or can't you be angry?

355
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:00,480
You know what?

356
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,280
Your reaction makes me believe you're…

357
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,090
What's it called?

358
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,350
A humanoid.

359
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,660
What are you talking about?

360
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,130
He's my husband.

361
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,860
Marriage is like this.

362
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,650
Passion will disappear after a while.

363
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,390
That's why we need to

364
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,520
do something exciting outside.

365
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:19,710
Right, honey?

366
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,100
Yes.

367
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,750
Don't you think so?

368
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,460
He's really obedient.

369
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,280
You can't

370
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,290
go against your initial obsession, can you?

371
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,750
I don't know what you're talking about. Go…

372
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,800
Where is the real Guan Xu?

373
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,070
What are you doing? You hurt me.

374
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:43,920
Let her go.

375
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,840
Cheng Nuo.

376
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,260
Who are you?

377
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,550
I'll call the police if you don't leave.

378
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,230
Cheng Nuo.

379
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,230
You knew Guan Xu had a problem at the very start.

380
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,870
Why didn't you tell me?

381
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,450
I was giving you a chance.

382
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,230
How do you think the business card of the bar was left?

383
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,830
And?

384
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,570
What did you find out?

385
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,480
You went to great lengths to date Jin Yan

386
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,530
and got nothing either.

387
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,680
Not exactly.

388
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,170
It's interesting

389
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,800
to see a humanoid in love

390
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,030
getting irritated, isn't it?

391
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,690
What have you been through?

392
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,620
Why are you hostile to the humanoids?

393
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,730
Anyway,

394
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,190
it's clear

395
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,230
that Guan Xu is a humanoid.

396
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,610
Where is the evidence?

397
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,190
You exposed yourself without evidence.

398
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,810
You have alerted the enemy.

399
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,800
Rookie.

400
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:57,980
What did you say?

401
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,210
Hello, Captain Gu.

402
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,160
Yes, I'd like you to come.

403
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,300
The address is 77 Garden Road.

404
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:11,810
It's an emergency.

405
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,230
I'll make up the application report.

406
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:14,330
Okay.

407
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,300
What are you doing?

408
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:23,750
Don't move.

409
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,060
It hurts?

410
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:31,950
No.

411
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:39,850
Thank you.

412
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:40,910
Don't say anything.

413
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,580
Let's pack up.

414
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:44,940
Where are we going?

415
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,250
To buy boat tickets.

416
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,650
It's not too late.

417
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,230
Do you know this is trespassing?

418
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,970
See? I knew they were leaving.

419
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,560
Let's go.

420
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,810
We don't need it. I'll buy it.

421
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,440
She was shifty-eyed

422
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,750
when I came here.

423
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,300
It means there must be something wrong here.

424
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,460
Are you so sure with just one look?

425
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,060
You know women so well?

426
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,050
I'm a professional.

427
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,900
About work or women?

428
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:42,370
Wait.

429
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,650
I'll go upstairs to get something.

430
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:46,640
Come here.

431
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:38,970
Professional.

432
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:55,920
Come here.

433
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,550
Where are you going

434
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:26,660
in such a hurry?

435
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,510
Where is your husband Guan Xu?

436
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,500
Where is he?

437
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:37,230
I don't know.

438
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,970
We broke up two years ago.

439
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,460
Why?

440
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,140
Time passed. Feelings faded.

441
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,380
Since your feelings faded,

442
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,120
why did you buy

443
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,870
a humanoid that looked similar to Guan Xu?

444
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,270
I was to blame.

445
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,090
I still had feelings for him.

446
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,500
Where were you in such a hurry?

447
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,330
My wife wants to travel.

448
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,110
The flight tonight is cheaper.

449
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,410
Your wife?

450
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:07,260
You're just a humanoid she bought.

451
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,920
Do you really think you're her husband?

452
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,910
What's with the blood on your studio?

453
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,100
I don't know.

454
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,070
This is your last chance to tell the truth.

455
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,170
What happened two years ago?

456
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,780
According to our investigation,

457
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,370
before the real Guan Xu went missing,

458
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,850
he had conducted long-term domestic violence against Jin Yan.

459
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:27,340
We strongly suspect that she killed her husband

460
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,840
because she couldn't stand it.

461
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,710
She bought you

462
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,440
to hide what she did.

463
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,370
You have no evidence, right?

464
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,310
The police will find out

465
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,800
the evidence you mentioned.

466
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,150
Anyway,

467
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,520
your wife is the biggest suspect now.

468
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,010
A promising female artist

469
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,530
killed her husband and abandoned his body.

470
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,660
I think it must be big news.

471
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,500
Do you think she can still

472
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,410
work in this circle?

473
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,480
Jin Yan has been separated from Guan Xu for a long time.

474
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,540
He was there too

475
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,760
when I got home that day.

476
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,070
I'm back.

477
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:03,170
Who is it?

478
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,780
I can't believe Jin Yan made something

479
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:18,200
that looks exactly like me.

480
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,110
Excuse me,

481
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,740
what should I call you?

482
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,830
Let me see.

483
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,980
It looks real.

484
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,410
Does it look like me?

485
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,180
Not at all.

486
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,260
What are you doing?

487
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,390
Are you a man?

488
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,450
Who do you think you are?

489
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:42,850
Let me tell you.

490
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,060
You're a customized version

491
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,330
of me, your master,

492
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,210
made by Jin Yan.

493
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,390
You can never replace me.

494
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,270
What are you doing?

495
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,530
Don't move.

496
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,850
I'm a human.

497
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,540
You are a dog.

498
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,470
Nonsense.

499
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,060
If Jin Yan gets tired of you,

500
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,300
she'll throw you away.

501
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,070
By then,

502
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,100
you'll be a stray dog.

503
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,790
How does a dog bark?

504
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:09,180
Greet your master.

505
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:11,900
Jin Yan, come downstairs.

506
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,900
Play with your dog with me.

507
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:17,770
Bitch.

508
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,750
Jin Yan.

509
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,340
Play with your dog with me.

510
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,370
Jin Yan, come downstairs.

511
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,790
You are a pathetic woman.

512
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,230
Bitch.

513
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:32,410
How can you fall in love with a doll?

514
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,090
Jin Yan, come out!

515
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:35,950
Jin Yan!

516
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,870
Jin Yan!

517
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,190
Jin Yan!

518
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,460
Come out!

519
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,370
Jin Yan!

520
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,900
The humanoid has turned himself in.

521
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:22,990
Okay, I got it.

522
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:26,780
You can leave now.

523
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,010
Don't leave Xiyuan City for the time being.

524
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,490
Director Wan,

525
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,140
teach him a lesson.

526
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,870
Okay?

527
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,600
Okay, that's it.

528
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,230
Sis,

529
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,550
you had time to climb the wall,

530
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,190
but you don't have time to treat me to dinner, right?

531
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,670
You even took… Who is this?

532
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,130
-An Qiu! An Qiu!
-An Qiu!

533
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,470
An Qiu

534
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,070
with you when trespassing?

535
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,390
How dare you?

536
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:58,010
An Qiu,

537
00:32:58,790 --> 00:32:59,790
don't do anything illegal

538
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,100
with Cheng Nuo.

539
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:01,810
Got it?

540
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:02,930
Sorry.

541
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,860
Go away.

542
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:06,560
Thank you, Captain Gu.

543
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,060
Bye.

544
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,060
Okay.

545
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:13,820
-It’s yours.
-Are you close to her?

546
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,240
This lady

547
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,090
is Captain Gu from the security team.

548
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,060
We need to contact her for

549
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,350
all the humanoid cases in Sheen Genome Institute.

550
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,160
I killed him.

551
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,710
Jin Yan doesn't know anything.

552
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,390
Where is the body?

553
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,980
The body is under the sculpture.

554
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,760
Wait.

555
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:25,449
Wait.

556
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,870
Guan Xu asked me to give this to you.

557
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,440
He said he had kept it for you.

558
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:39,940
He'll return it to you now.

559
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,199
Since he has pleaded guilty,

560
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,300
the case is closed.

561
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:46,340
You must be upset

562
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,780
with this result too.

563
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,360
It doesn't make sense

564
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,380
to feel bad for a humanoid

565
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,409
who is not even a real person.

566
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:56,010
Not even a real person?

567
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:58,500
All this time,

568
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,230
you've always thought

569
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,750
he's a fake.

570
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,560
That's why you doubt

571
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,760
if he loves you.

572
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,330
Then I'd like to ask

573
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,450
by what standard

574
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:10,910
you judge his authenticity.

575
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,620
By whether he's the real Guan Xu

576
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:15,700
or

577
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,820
whether he loves you?

578
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,690
How do you feel about him?

579
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,410
Do you love him?

580
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:28,920
Ms. Jin,

581
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,230
I'm not qualified

582
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,210
to judge your relationship.

583
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,760
But I think

584
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,330
only those who did wrong

585
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,760
must take the responsibility.

586
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,060
Take care.

587
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,240
Ms. Jin, thank you for your cooperation.

588
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,020
We'll get going.

589
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,590
All this time,

590
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,570
you've always thought

591
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,880
he's a fake.

592
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:57,800
That's why you doubt

593
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,930
if he loves you.

594
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,790
Do you know the better you treat me,

595
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:31,460
the more I feel...

596
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,440
I can't breathe.

597
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,690
I'm grateful for everything you've done for me.

598
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,010
But why don't you understand?

599
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,350
I can't love you.

600
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,850
So I'm sad too.

601
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,390
You need someone

602
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,370
who can also love you.

603
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,380
It's not me.

604
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,570
What? One is not enough?

605
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,010
I want to return him.

606
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,940
I can give up the money,

607
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:07,080
but you have to find him a good place to go.

608
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:10,780
Who could I return the custom-made one to?

609
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:14,460
Besides, no one will take it over.

610
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:16,500
You should

611
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:18,660
at least give me some fee.

612
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:21,960
How much do you want?

613
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,610
It's your birthday gift.

614
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,500
It's for me?

615
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:47,920
Yes.

616
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,700
Boss.

617
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,690
Where did you sell him?

618
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,700
Why are the surroundings so poor?

619
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,750
The conditions are limited.

620
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,390
Who would buy

621
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:34,980
a non-customized humanoid?

622
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:38,080
This is customized according to your requests.

623
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,270
Do you still want it?

624
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,160
Count the money.

625
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:08,850
What's wrong with you?

626
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,570
Did I do something wrong again?

627
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,470
I'm sorry.

628
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:23,980
Can I go with you?

629
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,950
Will you feel better

630
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:30,980
if I go with you?

631
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:41,260
I'll leave if you don't come with me.

632
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,810
Is it for us?

633
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,960
♫Lonely night, stars shine in the night♫

634
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:58,750
Can I try?

635
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,200
Sure.

636
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,190
I'm done. Polish it for me.

637
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,500
♫It was you dreaming by my side♫

638
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:05,870
Yes.

639
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,150
♫Quietly, no more pain inside♫

640
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,240
You can press harder here.

641
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,030
What kind of person is he?

642
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,920
He is someone

643
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,730
who hurts me

644
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:30,030
and doesn't trust me.

645
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,530
What are you doing?

646
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,110
It's late.

647
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,440
Don't go back.

648
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,070
What if she finds out?

649
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,870
I told you she's on a business trip.

650
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:49,830
You're so beautiful.

651
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,820
Of course.

652
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:52,980
I'm your wife's nude model after all.

653
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,450
But I think you're more beautiful

654
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,200
than in the painting.

655
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,520
Honey.

656
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,970
Why are you back?

657
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,380
Listen to me.

658
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:09,840
It's not like what you saw.

659
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:11,800
She came here.

660
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:13,480
I'm sorry.

661
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,450
I'm sorry.

662
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:15,650
Go away.

663
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:17,360
I don't want to see you anymore.

664
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:18,890
Don't do this. I'm sorry.

665
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:19,760
Don't touch me.

666
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:20,920
Let me explain.

667
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:21,870
I think you're disgusting.

668
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,480
It's not what you see.

669
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,370
-Okay?
-You’re not leaving?

670
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:25,430
I'll leave if you don't.

671
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:26,940
Fine.

672
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:28,040
Fine, I'm disgusting.

673
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,720
I apologize to you, okay?

674
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,440
Don't go.

675
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,920
Come in and tell me.

676
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,310
Do you think this is my problem?

677
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,090
All you care about are drawing

678
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:37,250
and your sculpture.

679
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:38,720
Have you ever thought about what I want?

680
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,730
Let go of me!

681
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,000
Let go of me!

682
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,640
Alright?

683
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,530
We're even now.

684
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:50,970
Don't be angry, okay?

685
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,340
I love you.

686
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:53,700
-I only love you.
-Let go!

687
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,200
-Stop it.
-Let go of me!

688
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,100
Are you done?

689
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,470
Are you done?

690
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,410
How dare you!

691
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,360
Are you done?

692
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,620
I love you.

693
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,940
I beg you. Stop it.

694
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:05,340
Honey.

695
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:53,130
[Do you really want to be tolerant and warmth?]

696
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:11,770
[Let's say no to humanoids]

697
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:46,980
I'm different from him.

698
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,270
I will never hurt you.

699
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:16,490
I killed him.

700
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:18,890
Jin Yan doesn't know anything.

701
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,390
I'm sorry.

702
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,010
I always owe you an apology.

703
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:34,180
For the past two years,

704
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:36,740
I've been feeling uneasy

705
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:38,390
every moment.

706
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,620
The more you want me to be happy,

707
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,990
the more I feel guilty

708
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:47,620
and miserable.

709
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,700
But I'm more afraid of falling in love with you.

710
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,860
I'm afraid I'll fall in love with you

711
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:01,080
when you're just carrying out your initial obsession.

712
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:34,210
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

713
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,450
The recall procedure of Guan Xu is in the works.

714
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:57,340
Thank you.

715
00:48:58,370 --> 00:48:58,980
For what?

716
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:00,660
Thank you for letting them see each other

717
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:01,840
for the last time.

718
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,180
I didn't expect

719
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,570
you'd help a humanoid.

720
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,430
You misunderstood.

721
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,260
I...

722
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,370
I was helping Jin Yan.

723
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,500
[Xiyuan No.1 Hospital]

724
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:19,970
How's your recovery?

725
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:21,830
Pretty good.

726
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:24,260
I heard everything from them.

727
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:25,930
You did a good job.

728
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,000
I didn't realize you'd come across such a complicated case

729
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,650
on your first assignment.

730
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:31,210
Fortunately, it was solved.

731
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,810
It feels quite strange.

732
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:38,580
I always feel that my intervention

733
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,030
has disrupted other's life.

734
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:45,070
It's hard to balance, right?

735
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:49,090
We infer

736
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:50,810
whether the target has initial obsession

737
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,430
and whether it's a humanoid.

738
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,360
Once it's confirmed,

739
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:56,770
they have to separate from the society.

740
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:58,410
Only in this way

741
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,410
can the society be more stable.

742
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:02,040
This is the most painful thing

743
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:04,320
in this job.

744
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,520
Why did they

745
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:08,400
create humanoids at the first place?

746
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,180
It's so-called life-changing technology

747
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,540
which, however, ignores the complexity of humanity

748
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:16,100
and is self-righteous.

749
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:19,520
Now the whole world is paying for it.

750
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:32,960
How is he?

751
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:36,110
Since you care about him so much,

752
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:37,470
why don't you go in and take a look?

753
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:39,280
Isn't he awake?

754
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:40,520
Why should I go in?

755
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,290
You sent the fruits, right?

756
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:46,740
I found it.

757
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:47,840
The address of purchasing bionic men.

758
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:48,670
It's on Old Street.

759
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:49,800
Let's go.

760
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:55,680
What are you waiting for?

761
00:50:56,110 --> 00:50:56,770
You don't want to go?

762
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:58,430
Yes.

763
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:16,700
What's wrong?

764
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:35,460
Have you been here?

765
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:49,010

766
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:56,240
