Li Yi has to make a living.

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,320
He's tall and strong.

20
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,080
He'll definitely choose some jobs

21
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,300
with high mobility

22
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,830
but not that strict identity verification.

23
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:21,550
And this job

24
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:22,720
can't be very eye-catching.

25
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,570
Do you think

26
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,530
he'll do temporary jobs at the construction site?

27
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,470
Maybe.

28
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,860
The construction site is crowded.

29
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,840
They don't care about who others are.

30
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,930
I'll let my friend ask around for me.

31
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,150
Your friend?

32
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:42,560
He's actually a middleman.

33
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,650
He helps find temporary work

34
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,420
for illegal residents.

35
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,970

But it turned out that you have a lot of friends.

38
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,490
He sent me a message.

39
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,750
Li Yi did contact him.

40
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,419
The places with stars

41
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,840
are where Li Yi used to be.

42
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,770
Li Yi has been very cautious.

43
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,020
He keeps changing his workplace.

44
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,850
He stayed at a construction site

45
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,630

46
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,860

There is no pattern at all.

49
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:30,120
Is he so afraid that we'll find him?

50
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:31,910

51

The number Wong Shipeng provided

00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,060
Okay.

176
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,310
Okay, see you tomorrow.

177
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,340
Bye.

178
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,490
Who is it?

179
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,320
People of Sheen Genome Institute

180
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,860
came to me today

181
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,250
and asked about Li Yi.

182
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:53,520
They wanted to

183
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,700
come here tomorrow.

184
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,420
Why?

185
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,280
Will Cong'er be questioned too?

186
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:03,810
Maybe.

187
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:04,990
Cong'er...

188
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,430
That's what I'm worried about too.

189
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,380
Dad, Mom, come and cut the cake.

190
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:11,760
Coming.

191
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,720
Let's cut the cake.

192
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,100
Come on.

193
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,140
Cong'er.

194
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,780
Do you know the characters on it?

195
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,640
Of course I do.

196
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,170
Huang Shipeng moved here six years ago.

197
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,240
More than six years.

198
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,070
I still remember

199
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,700
the time when they first moved in.

200
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,000
He's very polite.

201
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,070
Take it.

202
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,570
Glad to be your neighbor.

203
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,700
How long will it take?

204
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,450
We don't have many things.

205
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,159
We'll be quick.

206
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,020
Hurry up.

207
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,090
Okay, thank you.

208
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,049
Thank you.

209
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:39,909
Wait.

210
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,820
What about his daughter?

211
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,590
Daughter?

212
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,770
Maybe she moved here later.

213
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,130
Anyway, when they registered,

214
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,330
there were only two of them.

215
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,760
[Move-in Date: April 10th]

216
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,060
[Family Information] [Wife: Li Han]

217
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,650
Since they moved in,

218
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,970
we've always met.

219
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,870
I didn't see her daughter

220
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,420
when she moved here.

221
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,900
Once,

222
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,880
we adults

223
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,450
were playing with some kids.

224
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,570
She was also there.

225
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,990
She seemed to like kids very much,

226
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,900
we said to her,

227
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,550
"If you like kids so much,

228
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,730
you can have your own baby."

229
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,860
-Yeah.
-Guess what she said.

230
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,400
I have a child.

231
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,220
Why did she keep looking at

232
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,710
others' children

233
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,010
while she had her own child?

234
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,800
Is there something wrong with her?

235
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,750
Of course, it could be

236
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,230
that their daughter was with their parents

237
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,820
instead of living with them.

238
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,430
Well,

239
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,660
will they know I told you this?

240
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,660
No.

241
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,950
Do you remember

242
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:31,890
when they

243
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,260
brought Cong'er here?

244
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,620
Maybe half a year

245
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,730
after they moved in.

246
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,140
When did you take this?

247
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,150
My daughter took this

248
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,480
during the summer vacation.

249
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,060
How about this?

250
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,000
It looks

251
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,500
quite cute.

252
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,620
She was six or seven then.

253
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,210
She's so cute.

254
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,500
Do you have a picture of her when she was younger?

255
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,840
No.

256
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,290
Where's her childhood album?

257
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,270
I lost it when I moved.

258
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,150
What about copies on the phone,

259
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,850
or have you copied on the computer?

260
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,850
Excuse me.

261
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,490
Excuse me.

262
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,090
I don't understand.

263
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,400
Here's the thing.

264
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,620
I wonder why the photos

265
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,270
of my daughter

266
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,460
have anything to do with

267
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,810
Li Yi's disappearance?

268
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,040
Please relax, sir.

269
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,650
We're just asking.

270
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:27,860
Well,

271
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,930
If there's nothing else,

272
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,700
I have a lot of work to do today.

273
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,480
If Li Yi contacts me,

274
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,190
I'll inform you

275
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,980
ASAP, Mr. Huang.

276
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,190
Frankly speaking,

277
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,940
besides Li Yi,

278
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,540
I need to confirm something else with you.

279
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,880
Could you please tell me

280
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,850
where your daughter lived before seven?

281
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,220
Excuse me.

282
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,720
Well,

283
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,810
Are there any

284
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,620
misunderstandings?

285
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,560
Are you suspecting my daughter

286
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,680
to be a humanoid?

287
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:56,850
-No.
-Yes.

288
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,570
We're still investigating.

289
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,920
I think you've made a mistake.

290
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,240
Yes, that's impossible.

291
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,220
Then why did your daughter...

292
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,300
Mr. and Mrs. Huang, here's the thing.

293
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,100
We can't find your daughter's information

294
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,180
before seven in the database.

295
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,260
Can you explain it?

296
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,630
I'll be honest with you.

297
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,560
My daughter

298
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,780
was abducted when she was little.

299
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,400
Kidnapped?

300
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,190
Yes.

301
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,270
How old was she?

302
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,300
Three.

303
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,260
My wife took her out to go shopping.

304
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,050
But accidentally,

305
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,360
she got lost.

306
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,900
When did you find her?

307
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,120
When she was six.

308
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,470
How?

309
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,050
Someone found her on the street.

310
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,070
The police saved her.

311
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,110
So, you moved

312
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,120
before you found Cong'er.

313
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,360
What if

314
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,310
Cong'er had gone back to your old house

315
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,490
but couldn't have found you?

316
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,400
Well...

317
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,750
Actually,

318
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,180
Shipeng did it for me.

319
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,560
It drove me mad

320
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,590
when she got lost.

321
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,920
I was very sick.

322
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,690
The doctor advised us to find a new place to live.

323
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,510
That's why we moved.

324
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,260
We never gave up looking for her.

325
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,090
Yes.

326
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,420
Fortunately, we found her.

327
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,100
Yes.

328
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:16,930
Do you remember

329
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:17,730
who was the cop

330
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,450
that handled this case?

331
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,290
His surname is He.

332
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:22,890
Yes, Officer He.

333
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,420
Yes.

334
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,300
Do you have his contact information?

335
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,010
Yes.

336
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,090
This.

337
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,730
We need to check.

338
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,640
No problem.

339
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,270
Can I talk to Cong'er alone?

340
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,490
It's not appropriate.

341
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,670
Yes, she's too young.

342
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,330
Yes, I don't want to remind her of any bad memories.

343
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,570
I think you should think it through.

344
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,090
Do you want me to talk with her

345
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,390
here

346
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,630
or should I apply to take her to the police station?

347
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,940
Here's the thing.

348
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,120
We want to trust you.

349
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,760
But if we can

350
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,920
talk to Cong'er and confirm the information you provided,

351
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,140
it can save us a lot of unnecessary trouble.

352
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:09,850
I understand.

353
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,360
Shall I talk to her and ask her?

354
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:14,850
-No problem. -Yes.

355
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,760
Talk to the kid.

356
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,290
Okay.

357
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:16,890
Wait a moment. Thank you.

358
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:17,670
Wait a minute.

359
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,320
Cong'er.

360
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,110
Cong'er.

361
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,170
What do you want to talk with her about?

362
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,220
You think she's a humanoid?

363
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,360
I want to ask her a few questions

364
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,030
to test her reaction.

365
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,080
What's wrong?

366
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,470
Fine, if you think

367
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,350
that I'm too harsh,

368
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,270
you can stop me anytime.

369
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:49,530
Cong'er,

370
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,540
Can I ask you a few questions?

371
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,090
Cong'er.

372
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,070
Can we sit down and talk?

373
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,220
Cong'er.

374
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,720
After you were rescued by the police

375
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,650
and met your parents again,

376
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,040
could you recognize them?

377
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,060
Yes.

378
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,660
But it had been so long.

379
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,400
How could you be so sure

380
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,470
they are your parents?

381
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,700
How could you tell?

382
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,780
Just because of their faces?

383
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,890
Cong'er, don't worry.

384
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,230
Let's take our time.

385
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,980
Come here. Sit down.

386
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,990
Come here.

387
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,950
Will it be okay?

388
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,080
It will be okay.

389
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,060
I've read many reports.

390
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,660
Many lost children reject their parents

391
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,770
and treat them as strangers

392
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,250
after they are recovered.

393
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,100
After all, you were little then

394
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,090
and experienced a lot.

395
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,110
So, it's normal for you to forget

396
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,310
some people or some things that you used to know.

397
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,910
I just remembered.

398
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,780
I remembered they were my parents.

399
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,120
That's because you were implanted with your initial obsession.

400
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,040
That's why you believed it unconditionally.

401
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,420
You never thought

402
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,870
you might be a humanoid, right?

403
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,460
Enough.

404
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,530
Cong'er.

405
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,070
You don't need to answer it

406
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,860
-You don’t have to answer the question.
-Will parents

407
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,690
love their biological children more?

408
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,150
We are a family.

409
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,940
They won't abandon me.

410
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,490
Can you leave now?

411
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,640
Dad.

412
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,650
Did you smoke again?

413
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,880
You smelled it?

414
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,400
I won't smoke anymore.

415
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,820
Are the two people who came here today

416
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,610
to catch Uncle Li Yi?

417
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,070
Don't think too much.

418
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,440
Uncle Li Yi will be fine.

419
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,130
By the way,

420
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,680
what did those two people

421
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,630
say to you in the room?

422
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,080
Did they give you a hard time?

423
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,850
No.

424
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,980
They didn't give me a hard time.

425
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,070
That's good.

426
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,630
Huang Shipeng's parents have passed away.

427
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,810
Li Han's mother

428
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,280
was paralyzed due to a cerebral hemorrhage,

429
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,050
so her father has been taking care of her mother.

430
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,110
So, before Huang Cong'er was seven,

431
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,670
it was impossible for her grandparents to take care of her.

432
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,880
The police indeed had announced

433
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,620
lost information about Huang Cong'er.

434
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,620
The surname of the police officer who handled the case is He.

435
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,220
[Name: Huang Cong'er]

436
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,220
[Went missing at the Age of 3]

437
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,220
[Missing Since: April 6th]

438
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,500
[Gender: Female]

439
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,500
[Responsible Staff: He Yong]

440
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:05,579
Any other photos?

441
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,700
No.

442
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:10,069
Photos of missing children

443
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:11,530
are usually provided by parents.

444
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,210
But Huang Shipeng said

445
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,230
he didn't have any photos

446
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,170
of Huang Cong'er when she was little.

447
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,339
Maybe it's because

448
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,170
he is still wary of us.

449
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,490
How can we tell the girl in this photo

450
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,369
is Huang Cong'er?

451
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,960
I think all three-year-old girls look the same.

452
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,470
It's normal that you can't tell.

453
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,700
Cong'er is 12 years old now.

454
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,260
Of course she has changed a lot.

455
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:42,980
Come and have a look.

456
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,330
[The couple found their missing daughter after three years]

457
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,690
[The girl's name is Huang Cong'er] [She reunited with her parents]

458
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,400
I'm sorry.

459
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,650
We've never seen this person.

460
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,060
Then I'll ask...

461
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,580
Let me do it.

462
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,230
Honey, take a look.

463
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,560
Have you seen this person?

464
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,810
No.

465
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,180
No? OK.

466
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,800
I'm sorry.

467
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,210
We've never seen this family before.

468
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,160
It's okay.

469
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:18,550
OK.

470
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,540
Cong'er.

471
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,570
Sir.

472
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,610
Sheen Genome Institute is investigating cases of humanoids.

473
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,910
What does it have to do with my daughter?

474
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,210
Nothing.

475
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,650
Please go back then.

476
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,140
Now it's clear.

477
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,260
Huang Shipeng and his wife

478
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,000
can't have their own children.

479
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,330
After purchasing a humanoid,

480
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,800
he stole Huang Cong'er's name and experience

481
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,930
from the news.

482
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,570
Is it necessary to go through all the trouble?

483
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,630
Why did they use the information of Cong'er?

484
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,540
Because they have the same surname.

485
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,160
Her age also makes sense.

486
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,730
It's easier to operate.

487
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,850
Huang Shipeng is a liar.

488
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,780
Maybe he lied to us as well

489
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:56,820
about Li Yi.

490
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,570
I think he won't tell the truth

491
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,780
unless we push him harder.

492
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,510
What are you going to do?

493
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,100
We have news

494
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,100
that there's been an identification accident at Sheen Genome Institute.

495
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,760
A man who was suspected of being a humanoid

496
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,740
had a bad reaction after being injected with an identification drug.

497
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:23,110
The man's family has filed a lawsuit against Sheen Genome Institute.

498
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,080
We promise to adjust the investigation process

499
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,720
and strengthen supervision.

500
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,290
Gao Yuan,

501
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,960
do you know where Cheng Nuo is?

502
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,140
Cheng Nuo?

503
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,030
He went to apply for an identification drug.

504
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,930
Identification drug?

505
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,040
Did Cheng Nuo come to get the identification drug?

506
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:50,940
Yes.

507
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,030
Don't you need two people's signatures?

508
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,300
Isn't this yours?

509
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,910
Mr. Huang.

510
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,490
Mr. Huang.

511
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,390
Where is Cong'er?

512
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,940
She's at home.

513
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,510
What's wrong?

514
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,030
What are you doing?

515
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:10,650
Cong'er.

516
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:11,720
-Come out, Cong'er.
-Go away!

517
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,360
What are you doing?

518
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,000
Cong'er.

519
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,320
-Go away.
-Cheng Nuo.

520
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,050
Cheng Nuo.

521
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,130
What are you doing?

522
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,710
He insisted that Cong'er is a humanoid.

523
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,050
He wants to inject her with some drugs.

524
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,560
Are you not going to cooperate?

525
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,200
Leave. Leave my house now.

526
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,370
Or I'll call the police.

527
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,100
Call the police?

528
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,530
Okay, go ahead.

529
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,550
Go ahead.

530
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:27,210
Cheng Nuo.

531
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,500
Are you done?

532
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,880
You don't have my authorization to use my signature.

533
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,110
Do you know

534
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,020
what consequences you may face?

535
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:44,890
Please leave.

536
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,980
I'll get going then.

537
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,200
Wait.

538
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,810
Can I talk to you alone?

539
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,030
Why did you forge my signature?

540
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,420
Those words you said

541
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,680
were from the perspective of an investigator

542
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,760
or Cong'er?

543
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,330
Is that important?

544
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,810
Huang Shipeng hopes

545
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,970
that we can leave them alone.

546
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,930
So, he told me something about Li Yi

547
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,000
in exchange.

548
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,590
Tell me.

549
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,730
Huang Shipeng was owed some transportation fees.

550
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,220
He was beaten up

551
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,300
when he went to ask for it.

552
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,980
After Li Yi found out,

553
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,360
he helped Huang Shipeng

554
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,460
get all his money back.

555
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,400
Since then,

556
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,940
Huang Shipeng has treated Li Yi

557
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,320
as his family.

558
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,270
Have you really made up your mind

559
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,480
to leave?

560
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,320
Yes, Peng.

561
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,680
Let me ask you something.

562
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,430
Are you in trouble?

563
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,180
Tell me if so.

564
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,930
-I’ll help you if I can.
-Peng.

565
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,230
I didn't mean to keep it a secret.

566
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,520
I'm afraid

567
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,510
if I tell you, it will incur trouble for you.

568
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,630
What trouble can it be?

569
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,360
I'll help you if I can.

570
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,640
Don't worry.

571
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,280
I'll take care of it myself.

572
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,590
He said he always had the feeling

573
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,500
that Li Yi had secrets that he couldn't tell

574
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,910
and that's why he left.

575
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,070
Therefore, when we went to him at first,

576
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,420
he hid the truth

577
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,310
as he was worried we would spite Li Yi.

578
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,030
Does he know where Li Yi is?

579
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,870
But Huang Shipeng said

580
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,340
Li Yi would visit them occasionally.

581
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,370
He came just a few days ago.

582
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,950
So, I think

583
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,700
we should wait here.

584
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,790
Maybe Li Yi will show up.

585
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,440
I knew it.

586
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,490
I knew that once I made a scene,

587
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,900
you would stand up for the Huang family.

588
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,790
Once you do that,

589
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,470
in order to protect his daughter,

590
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,230
Huang Shipeng will tell the truth.

591
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:02,590
After all, his daughter is much more important than Li Yi.

592
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,890
You made such a big fuss

593
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,770
just to investigate your own business?

594
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:07,370
Of course not.

595
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,030
I won't make a deal with Huang Shipeng.

596
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,630
As for Huang Cong'er,

597
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,830
I'll keep investigating.

598
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,300
So, you used me

599
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,440
and everyone?

600
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:15,750
I was not really going to inject her.

601
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:16,760
You're hopeless.

602
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,460
Good night. See you tomorrow.

603
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,350
Did that person

604
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,220
ask you for money again?

605
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,030
Yes.

606
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,160
I feel uneasy.

607
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,280
Do you think we can fool them

608
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,180
with what we said this afternoon?

609
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:56,320
Will Sheen Genome Institute keep pestering Cong'er?

610
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,110
She hasn't fallen asleep yet.

611
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,280
Don't let her hear you.

612
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,120
Why didn't you answer the phone?

613
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,930
This is Huang Shipeng's bank transaction record.

614
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,760
A month ago,

615
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,260
he withdrew a large sum of cash.

616
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,680
That was when Li Yi resigned.

617
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,030
He withdrew some money again yesterday.

618
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,260
I checked his company.

619
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,080
Its profit is always very low.

620
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,790
He can't make much money a year.

621
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:57,220
And every time the money went into his bank account, he withdrew it.

622
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,330
What did he

623
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,280
use all the cash for?

624
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,110
Are you still angry?

625
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,950
I admit

626
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,280
I did something wrong today.

627
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:15,850
But I did it

628
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,320
to force him to tell us about Li Yi.

629
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,790
That's why I deliberately provoked him.

630
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,780
But still,

631
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,320
he didn't say anything true.

632
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,030
Now his whole family

633
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,280
doesn't like me.

634
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,810
So I'm thinking

635
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,910
maybe we should

636
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,090
talk with Cong'er alone.

637
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,760
I think Cong'er

638
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,480
has something to do with Li Yi.

639
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,900
Can you help me?

640
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,970
You think you did nothing wrong, right?

641
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,130
You apologized to me

642
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,120
just because I'm useful?

643
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,160
I'll have what she has. Three more glasses.

644
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,300
I'll drink three glasses to say sorry.

645
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,130
OK?

646
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,130
You don't have to punish yourself.

647
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,030
If you can outdrink me,

648
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,080
I will

649
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:06,400
talk to Cong'er.

650
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,220
Sure.

651
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,080
Give up.

652
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,310
Do you know why you lost?

653
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,330
I lost.

654
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,330
There's no reason.

655
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,210
We're talking about who can drink more,

656
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,630
not who can drink faster.

657
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,700
You're drunk because you drank too fast.

658
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,780
It is what it is. Why bother to think about why?

659
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,070
You're always like this.

660
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,190
To win, to achieve your goal,

661
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,660
you charge ahead.

662
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,740
But you can only see what's right in front of you.

663
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,450
You can't see the details.

664
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,560
If you do this,

665
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,950
you'll only hurt yourself.

666
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,980
Okay, I lost.

667
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,730
I lost, okay?

668
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,810
You can't control yourself,

669
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:05,890
right?

670
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,230
You keep

671
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,580
working

672
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,390
and never give yourself a day off,

673
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,440
right?

674
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,540
Yes.

675
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,710
You know you're annoying,

676
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,190
right?

677
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,670
I'm sorry.

678
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:41,740
Look.

679
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,680
That apology is sincere.

680
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:48,970
Thank you.

681
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,360
If you hadn't

682
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,960
found the humanoids in the shantytown,

683
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,120
maybe I couldn't have found

684
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,760
any clues about my mother until now.

685
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,440
So, if you have any plan,

686
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,900
don't hide it from me anymore.

687
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,070
I'm your partner.

688
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,240
Don't push me away.

689
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,360
As for Cong'er,

690
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,640
I'll find a chance to talk to her.

691
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,920
But later.

692
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:24,520
We've been pushing her too hard these days.

693
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:28,890
Okay.

694
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,280
Apart from work,

695
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,860
we haven't talked about anything else.

696
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:52,640
You...

697
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:56,120
What do you want to say?

698
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,700
Don't hang up on me again.

699
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,810
How did you find me?

700
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,860
Shen Li told me

701
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,460
You often drink here.

702
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,110
Can I ask you something?

703
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,890
I can't find

704
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,300
I can't find any information

705
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:27,720
about humanoids on the Internet.

706
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,450
What

707
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,340
happened there?

708
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:45,020
I don't know the details.

709
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,860
I heard the studio renovation project

710
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:48,750
went on for a long time.

711
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,170
But it didn't go well.

712
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,210
Therefore, that place was deserted.

713
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,160
The jurisdiction is blurry.

714
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,230
I guess that's why Lyu Yan

715
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,930
chose to hide there.

716
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:03,270
What's wrong?

717
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,790
Nothing.
