00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,120
Did you see someone running out?

5
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,240
He's wearing a hat and has a red birthmark on his face.

Did you see someone running over?

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,850
With a red birthmark on his face, wearing a hat?

8

Did you see someone running over?

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,920
With a red birthmark?

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:34,400
No.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:34,910
Cheng Nuo.

12
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:35,510
Did you see him?

13
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,210
Calm down.

14
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,280
Sorry.

15
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:37,790
Sorry.

16
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,700
Who did you see?

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,420
He's dead.

18
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,670
Another humanoid is dead.

19
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,560
Another one died.

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,770
Another humanoid is dead.

21
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,090
Where is it?

22
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:57,800
The landfill.

23
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:58,960
I heard it's the same as before.

24
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,560
There are drawings around. Take me there.

25
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,700
Help me look after the shop.

26
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,250
Let's go.

27
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,240
Let's go.

28
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,070
Look.

29
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:06,730
Another humanoid died.

30
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,510
What a mess.

31
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,890
Why is there another one? Look.

32
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,430
Are you scared?

33
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,270
How is it? Isn't it exciting?

34
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,890
And the floor. Look at the drawings.

35
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,200
What does this mean?

36
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:22,810
It's a bionic human.

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,710
Contact the Recall Department

38
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,500
and bring him back to Sheen Genome Institute.

39
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,520
When did he die?

40
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,930
How would I know?

41
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,500
I didn't see it till I got here.

42
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,330
One died a few days ago.

43
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,530
Now, another one has died.

44
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,690
Are there other bionic humans?

45
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,700
Yes.

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,850
Over there.

47
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,240
Take me there.

48
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:39,670
Let's go.

49
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,140
Was he found here?

50
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,400
I'm not sure

51
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,740
where he was found.

52
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,850
But I heard from them that

53
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,560
when the body was found,

54
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,890
it was just like that one.

55
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,470
It was also posed in a strange position.

56
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,079
There were many drawings beside it too.

57
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:17,550
It was kind of creepy.

58
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,160
Have you seen this person?

59
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,230
Take a closer look.

60
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,410
There's a red birthmark on his face.

61
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,180
It really doesn't ring a bell.

62
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,430
Is he the culprit?

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,880
Where is Cheng Nuo?

68
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,690
I don’t know.

69
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,400
Why is he acting alone again?

70
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,480
What's wrong? Did something happen?

71
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,530
We met someone on Old Street today.

72
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:53,820
He's called Lyu Yan.

73
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,100
Cheng Nuo kept chasing him.

74
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,590
I asked him who it was, but he didn’t answer my question.

75
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,870
Director, do you know this person?

76
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,930
After bumping into Lyu Yan,

77
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,500
Cheng Nuo started acting strange.

78
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,730
I know it’s his personal business.

79
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,610
But I think as partners,

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,110
we should have a basic level of trust.

81
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,770
I should know him better.

82
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,680
Cheng Nuo’s mother Zhang Ya

83
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,560
used to be a humanoid researcher with BSheen Genome Institute.

84
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,090
Lyu Yan was one of her partners.

85
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,230
But...

86
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,270
But one year ago,

87
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,240
Zhang Ya jumped off a building and committed suicide.

88
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,100
The last call she made

89
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,240
before she died was to Lyu Yan.

90
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,409
After she died,

91
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,110
Lyu Yan

92
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,280
also disappeared.

93
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,680
The four victims don't know each other

94
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,410
and had no common friends.

95
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,380
They even live far away.

96
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,090
There are two similarities in these four cases.

97
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,190
One,

98
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,270
all the victims are bionic humans.

99
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,420
Two,

100
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,930
after the killer commits the crime,

101
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,430
he'd leave the Gemini diagram at the scene.

102
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,400
The same killing ritual

103
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,340
and the same modus operandi

104
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,110
indicate that it's a serial killer.

105
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,230
There's one more thing they share in common.

106
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,530
They are all related to Old Street.

107
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:36,780
Are you okay?

108
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,190
Chen Xinhui's case is not related to Old Street, right?

109
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,430
At first glance, no.

110
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,640
But I've checked.

111
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,850
When she was bought by Fang Yuan's mother,

112
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,740
it was on Old Street.

113
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,740
How did the killer know

114
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,040
they are all humanoids?

115
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,190
The killer might be very familiar

116
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,020
with the humanoid trade on Old Street.

117
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,610
So we're guessing

118
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,220
the killer's probably a resident of Old Street.

119
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,760
Old Street is messy, with all sorts of people.

120
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,190
Our work

121
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,850
may be very difficult.

122
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,940
Even if I have to go door to door,

123
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,410
I'll dig him out.

124
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,900
Auntie, have you seen this man?

125
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,950
Go away.

I'm An Qiu, an investigator with Sheen Genome Institute.

-Hello.

129

Do you know this person?

00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,240
Have you seen this person?

131
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,740
So many stray cats and dogs die every day.

132
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,640
Please take a look.

133
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:36,990
Do you know this person?

134
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,770
Isn't he the humanoid who died nearby?

135
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,700
Have you heard of this?

136
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,290
I've never met him. Have you seen this photo?

137
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,070
I don't know him.

138
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:42,900
You don't remember anything?

139
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:43,550
No.

140
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,310
Do you want a bird?

141
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,200
Hello, have you seen this person?

142
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,750
No, I don't think so.

143
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,380
Hello, have you seen this person?

144
00:07:58,409 --> 00:07:59,250
No.

145
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,790
Hello, have you seen this person?

146
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,990
Have you seen this person?

147
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,550
I asked if you know this person.

148
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,430
What's your name?

149
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,030
What's your name?

150
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,919
I said, what's your name?

151
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,870
I said, what's your name?

152
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,669
I'm asking your name.

153
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,640
I'm asking your name.

154
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:44,860
Hello.

155
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,360
My name is An Qiu.

156
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,960
What about you?

157
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,240
Hello, my name is An Qiu. What about you?

158
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,490
This is your name, right?

159
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,090
Your name is Yihang.

160
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,540
Did you draw these?

161
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,210
What's the name of this painting?

Red Mill Dance Party.

163

Red.

164
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,530
What are you drawing now?

165
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,830

Cheng Nuo.

Cheng Nuo.

169

Cheng Nuo.
It’s you, right?

170
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,080

Your son was at the scene of the humanoid's murder.

175
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,800
There's a good chance he had something to do with this.

176
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:47,460
Go away.

177
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,770
My son has nothing to do with this.

178
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,640
Nothing.

179
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,330
Nothing. Nothing.

180
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:50,700
Nothing.

181
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,400
It's okay, Yihang.

182
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,520
Painting. It's okay.

183
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,800
Don't go. Come back.

184
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,260
Who are you to slander my son?

185
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,450
What evidence do you have?

186
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,630
Cheng Nuo, let's go.

187
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,450
Go!

188
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,200
Are you done dragging me?

189
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,020
What you're doing is useless.

190
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,480
He probably has autism.

191
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:19,980
As it is, communication with the outside world is...

192
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,010
Did you hear what he said?

193
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,150
He said there was a lot of blood.

194
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,470
And Lyu Yan was also there.

195
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,320
It's very likely that

196
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:24,780
they killed those humanoids together. You know...

197
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,780
I heard it.

198
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,480
You need to calm down.

199
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,280
You've lost control.

200
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,150
I'm very calm.

201
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,450
I don't need you to teach me.

202
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,370
I'm really sorry

203
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,690
for causing you so much trouble.

204
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,200
Actually, I don't know

205
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,810
how to take care of this child.

206
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,410
Is what you said true?

207
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,640
We're not sure yet.

208
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,740
But the person we are looking for

209
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,270
is the one in Yihang's painting.

210
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,240
We suspect

211
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,790
he's the murderer who killed the humanoids.

212
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,100
I always thought I know my child well,

213
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,690
but sometimes I feel that he's a stranger.

214
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,100
I still don't understand

215
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,160
why Yihang

216
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,730
draws himself

217
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,310
into every painting.

218
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,700
If he didn't do that,

219
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,220
there wouldn't be so much trouble.

220
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,650
He would draw himself

221
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,310
into every painting?

222
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,120
Look.

223
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,850
Of course I hope that

224
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,910
Yihang has nothing to do with this.

225
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,960
But we can only really help him

226
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,840
if we find out the truth.

227
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,700
Do you know where he might go?

228
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,780
Yihang.

229
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:47,730
Don't be afraid.

230
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,580
I just want to ask you a few questions.

231
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,650
Just answer me honestly, okay?

232
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,610
What did you mean

233
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,090
when you said there was a lot of blood this afternoon?

234
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,690
A lot of blood.

235
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:01,690
Yes.

236
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:02,440
A lot of blood.

237
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,510
Yihang, look at me.

238
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,720
Did you hurt the humanoid?

239
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,380
Hurt the humanoid?

240
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,380
Also, Yihang, look.

241
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,050
Who taught you to draw that?

242
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,690
Who? Draw?

243
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,310
Yihang, look at me.

244
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,670
Who taught you to draw that?

245
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,370
Draw.

246
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,490
This is the man in the painting, right?

247
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,610
Yihang. Yihang!

248
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:23,570
Yihang.

249
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,520
Cheng Nuo!

250
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,310
Yihang!

251
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,090
Cheng Nuo!

252
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,280
Yihang.

253
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,230
What are you doing?

254
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,240
He's not the killer.

255
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,980
I saw him draw that with my own eyes.

256
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,200
If he wasn't the killer,

257
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,160
how could he have drawn so many details

258
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,010
of the scene where the body was dumped?

259
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,540
This is his talent.

260
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,150
He can imitate others' drawings

261
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,190
and can draw

262
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,690
exactly what he sees.

263
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,310
He said he bled a lot this afternoon.

264
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,210
What does it mean?

265
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,120
Cheng Nuo, calm down.

266
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,240
Yihang usually wanders around the Old Street.

267
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,710
I heard that

268
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,210
the humanoid

269
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,460
was thrown beside

270
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,670
the trash cans in the alley.

271
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,490
Yihang probably saw it

272
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,730
and drew it.

273
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,130
Maybe Yihang is a witness.

274
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,080
He is in the painting.

275
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,350
You're telling me he was a witness?

276
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,100
He draws himself into every painting.

277
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,230
He wants everyone to acknowledge him.

278
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,210
He wants everyone to know

279
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,630
he drew all the paintings.

280
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,320
These are all your speculations.

281
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,190
Even if he was a witness,

282
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,940
why isn't he telling me who was in the painting?

283
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,760
And where he is?

284
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,020
Are you really just looking for the killer?

285
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,010
What do you mean?

286
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,950
Your mother committed suicide.

287
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,090
Will this change if you find Lyu Yan?

288
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,270
Yes.

289
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,650
Nothing will change.

290
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,040
But I just want to know

291
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,160
whether my mom's death has anything to do with me.

292
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:21,090
[Happy birthday, son.]

293
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,310
Every year on my birthday,

294
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,040
she was working.

295
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,700
Gradually,

296
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,670
I didn't expect

297
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,250
to celebrate my birthday with her anymore.

298
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:35,990
But

299
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,500
I was 15 that year.

300
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,640
She even misremembered my age.

301
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:43,880
Compared to me,

302
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,480
she cared more about the research on humanoids.

303
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,480
I studied hard and got into a prestigious school

304
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,760
to be seen by her.

305
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,980
Mom, I got in.

306
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:55,710
MIT.

307
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:57,670
Okay.

308
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,870
It's a full-ride scholarship.

309
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,960
I knew you'd be accepted.

310
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,420
But no matter what achievement I got,

311
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,700
she just took it for granted.

312
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:29,170
In a way, humanoids

313
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,110
are more stubborn and extreme than us.

314
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,250
But I believe they still have a chance to improve.

315
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,470
I didn't go to college

316
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,360
and became an investigator at Sheen Genome Institute.

317
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:39,910
I thought this time,

318
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,640
she would take me seriously.

319
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,870
I even prepared

320
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,240
to be scolded by her.

321
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,190
You can come to me anytime.

322
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:48,690
Okay.

323
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,310
You're welcome.

324
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,470
Ms. Zhang.

325
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,990
Cheng Nuo has joined our department.

326
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,920
Why are you here?

327
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,730
You guys talk first.

328
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,700
What's going on?

329
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:11,940
I'm not going to MIT.

330
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:13,990
I work here.

331
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,270
I want to investigate humanoids too.

332
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,320
It's your life.

333
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,030
Make your own decisions.

334
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,090
What are you doing?

335
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,880
Move!

336
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,050
Cheng Nuo.

337
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:55,720
Pay me!

338
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,180
Cheng Nuo.

339
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,040
Pay me!

340
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,180
Let go of me!

341
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,580
Let go of me!

342
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,360
Why are you beating up humanoids?

343
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,300
They'll get hurt.

344
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,580
You only care about them.

345
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,960
Didn't you see that I’m hurt too?

346
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,460
Cheng Nuo, you’ve grown up.

347
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,480
You’re independent now.

348
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,980
You should learn to be calm

349
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,990
and not vent your discontent

350
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:31,990
by hurting humanoids.

351
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,000
If you like those bionic humans so much,

352
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,600
why did you give birth to me?

353
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,450
Just get a humanoid to be your son.

354
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,320
To her,

355
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,440
I've always been redundant.

356
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,840
So I blocked her phone number and information

357
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,580
and disappeared from her world.

358
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,000
Until that day.

You just

364
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,530
wanted your mother's attention.

365
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,450
I always said she didn't care about me.

366
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,260
But actually, I didn't care about her.

367
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,150
I didn't even know she had depression.

368
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,850
Even the last thing I said to her

369
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:31,760
was to let a humanoid be her son.

370

Do you remember Yihang's painting?

371

She died in a car accident a year ago.

Where did you find it?

378

It's been over two hours.

Lyu Yan hasn't come yet.

385

I don't think he's coming.

he might.

Thank you.

394

Enough. Let's go.

395
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,820

Forget it.

Why?

You've been here for so long.

407
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,610
A little longer won't make a difference, right?

He’s here.

411
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,880
Wait. He's running away.

412

Nothing.

No wonder I couldn't find Lyu Yan.

He has been hiding here.

422

Let's go.

423
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,170
Okay.

424

Cheng Nuo.

427
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,050
Do you know Lyu Yan?

428
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,960
Why did he lock you up?

429
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,730
It doesn't matter if you don't want to talk.

430
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,270
Lyu Yan killed someone

431
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,420
and abducted teenagers and children.

432
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,580
Now he's caught red-handed.

433
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,050
When he comes back,

434
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,090
we'll put him into jail.

435
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,370
Uncle Lyu Yan is a good man.

436
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,940
You can't arrest him.

437
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,700
Uncle Lyu Yan is a good man.

438
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,310
Kids.

439
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,000
Uncle Lyu Yan.

440
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,000
Uncle Lyu Yan.

441
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,100
Why are you here?

442
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,760
Why did you kill those humanoids?

443
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,680
I didn't kill them.

444
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:31,600
Then why was your locket

445
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,930
at the scene of the murder?

446
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,340
Where's my locket?

447
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:35,060
Give it to me.

448
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,150
Are you going to tell me or not?

449
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,510
I didn't kill those humanoids.

450
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,330
I ran into you on Old Street yesterday

451
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,580
because I heard someone died

452
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,070
so I went there.

453
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,410
Explain the three kids then.

454
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,010
Let go.

455
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:49,840
Those three kids

456
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,040
are all homeless children I met along the way.

457
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,770
I'm helping them find foster homes.

458
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,400
I didn't kill anyone.

459
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,420
What did my mom say

460
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,160
in her last phone call?

461
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,410
Do you really think

462
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,500
Zhang Ya committed suicide?

463
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,970
What do you mean?

464
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,840
She would never commit suicide.

465
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,310
Not long after the humanoid recall was announced,

466
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:17,790
Zhang Ya established

467
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:19,110
a humanoid research lab.

468
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,250
I joined the lab

469
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,250
after it was established.

470
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,600
I requested for data on

471
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,130
a batch of humanoids from Sheen Genome Institute.

472
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,230
for Dr. Zhang's research.

473
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:32,500
She said she wanted

474
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,930
to find a way to get rid of

475
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,280
humanoids' initial obsessions

476
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:38,260
so they can better integrate into human society.

477
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,970
But not long after,

478
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,560
Zhang Ya suddenly called me

479
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:43,860
to say we need to stop the research program.

480
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,280
She asked me to meet her in the lab.

481
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,040
But I didn't find her in the lab.

482
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:49,990
Who's there?

483
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,680
Instead, I saw a person

484
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,130
leave the lab.

485
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,310
Then why didn't you chase him?

486
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,130
-At that time,
-Dr. Zhang Ya fell off the building!

487
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,470
I just wanted to keep what I left in the safe.

488
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,770
That was information about the humanoids that we were about to start research on.

489
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,550
Her experiment was still a secret.

490
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:15,850
Did you see his face?

491
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,120
Why did the murderer take it?

492
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,130
He was...

493
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,110
silencing people.

494
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,270
I hadn't given this name list

495
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,590
to Dr. Zhang.

496
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,040
I heard many humanoids died.

497
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,510
So I looked into it.

498
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,450
I found that the victims

499
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,420
were the same batch of humanoids who were sent to the Sheen Genome Institute headquarters.

500
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,460
So you went to the scene

501
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,710
to confirm the victim's identity?

502
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:49,820
I've been looking for you all year.

503
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,050
Why did you hide it from me?

504
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,330
Why do you run away when you saw me?

505
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:56,230
I didn't mean to keep

506
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,100
Zhang Ya's death a secret from you.

507
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,770
It's because I'm scared.

508
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,270
Scared of what?

509
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,270
I don't know the murderer's purpose,

510
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,540
but it must be related to the lab.

511
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,530
After all,

512
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,160
I was involved in the lab too.

513
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,000
It's only a matter of time

514
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,820
before he comes to silence me.

515
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,850
