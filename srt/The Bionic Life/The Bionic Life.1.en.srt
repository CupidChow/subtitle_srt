This is the near future.

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,100
Gene editing technology has developed rapidly.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,290
A scientific life form called "humanoid"

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,660
has been created.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,380
The physiological structure of humanoids

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,290
is almost the same as that of humans.

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,980
The only difference

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,020
is that the neurons in their brains

10
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,160
have been gene-edited in a certain way.

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,240
They have a sole initial obsession that must be obeyed.

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,680
They can be loyal spouses
until the end of their lives.

13
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,210
They can be meek and filial children.

14
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,140
They can be employees loyal to their boss.

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,170
These custom-made humanoids started to circulate

16
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,870
as commercial goods in the worldwide.

17
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,500
Even in some countries where production

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,180
and selling of humanoids are illegal,

19
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,790
there are still outlaws

20
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,450
who bring

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,360
humanoids into their country without permission

22
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,660
and sell them secretly.

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,670
Along with the wide spread of humanoids,

24
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,330
their risks gradually emerge.

25
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,230
More and more people

26
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,070
started to be addicted to

27
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,130
the fake emotions provided by humanoids.

28
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,750
And for humanoids themselves,

29
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,750
their thoughts and emotions

30
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,960
are easily deformed

31
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,130
under the restriction of the initial obsession.

32
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,710
Many malignant incidents happened due to that.

33
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,240
In the face of 
the more and more serious situation,

34
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,470
the international society 
quickly held a meeting.

35
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,010
The production ban 
and the recall of humanoids

36
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,250
were approved unanimously.

37
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:22,970
According to the agreement,

38
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,720
all nations will stop producing humanoids immediately.

39
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,130
They should also recall and centrally manage

40
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,240
all the humanoids in their country.

was established in Xiyuan City very quickly.

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,300
It's to cooperate with the police

44
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,430
to search for and identify 
the humanoids in our country.

45
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,580
However, the process isn't going smoothly.

46
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,380
The only way to identify a humanoid

47
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,670
is to inject the identification drug

48
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,870
and then observe if the pupils would change color.

49
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,970
However, the identification drug is still defective.

50
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,600
It's very harmful to ordinary people.

51
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,220
Therefore, its use is strictly restricted.

52
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,130
Up until now,

53
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,120

The deceased

66
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:20,880
was a female.

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,350
Three days ago,

68
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,310
she broke into a hot spring hotel, armed.

69
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,780
She ended up injuring a mother and her son in a room.

In order to protect his mother,

72
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,000
the kid stabbed the lunatic woman to death.

73
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,470
She fell into the fire pit

74
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:33,810
and her face was burned.

75
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,710
The body was burned too badly,

76
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,540
so it cannot be identified.

77
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,040
The identity of the deceased is unknown.

78
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,940
And it doesn't match the missing file in the last few months.

79
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,640
So the police need our cooperation

80
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,550
to conduct an identification process

81
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,660
to check if she was a humanoid.

82
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,560
Her body was burned so severely

83
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,660
that her pupils can't even be seen.

84
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,710
Naturally, the drug won't work either.

Our work will be difficult.

86

Even if she was a humanoid,

she's already dead.

What's that look on the kid's face?

91
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,830
Didn't he just kill someone?

92
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,120
No matter how mature he is,

93
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,550
he shouldn't be so calm.

94

Because of the thunderstorm,

the signals of the surveillance cameras were affected,

98

so they were on and off.

Then I ran up.

No problem.

I heard a huge knock.

139
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,180
I pushed my boyfriend at that time.

140
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,040
He was fast asleep.

141
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:05,800
Did she also knock on your door?

142
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,730
Yes.

143
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,530
I went near the door

144
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,450
and scolded her.

145
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,840

146
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,630

158

very loud noises.

160
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,260

00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,060
with what you asked.

173
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,380
We just suspect

174
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,060
the one who attacked you that day

175
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,200
might be a humanoid.

176
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,230
A humanoid?

177
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,940
I don't know.

178
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,080
I was very scared.

179
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,290
I've said everything I can remember.

180
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,250
Ms. Chen,

181
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,570
where is your son?

182
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:12,780
We want to see him.

183
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,500
Sorry.

184
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,950
He's sleeping.

185
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,540
It's not easy for him to fall asleep.

186
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,280
You want to talk to him?

187
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,430
I know everything he knows.

188
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,250
Can I tell you?

189
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:25,990
Of course.

190
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,070
Can you tell us

191
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,750
what happened when you were attacked 
the day before yesterday?

192
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,060
Yuan won the second place in the piano competition.

193
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,500
I promised

194
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,670
to take him to the hot spring hotel for two days.

195
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,840
Did you have fun today?

196
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,470
Yes.

197
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,480
Have a good dream.

198
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,000
Who is it?

199
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,789
Let go of my child.

200
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,270
Let go of my child!

201
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,440
Yuan, run!

202
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,770
That's what happened.

203
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,950
Who do you think she was?

204
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,550
Why did she attack you?

205
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:33,850
A hobo?

206
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,980
Or

207
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,450
someone from a mental hospital?

208
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,440
Or

209
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,890
a humanoid as we suspect?

210
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:43,380
But it's fine.

211
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,150
If she was a humanoid,

212
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,690
it's easier for us to deal with her.

213
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,250
Ms. Chen,

214
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:52,890
you know

215
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,560
what we do, right?

216
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,240
Sheen Genome Institute.

217
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,280
You specialize in investigating humanoids.

218
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,600
Then you should know

219
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,500
the danger of humanoids, right?

220
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:05,650
Ms. Chen,

221
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,020
do you have anything else to tell us?

222
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,750
You'd better do it now.

223
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,980
I have nothing more to say.

224
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,500
I'm sorry.

225
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,040
I need to cook for my child.

226

[Please trust humans once again] 
[We'll take you home]

227
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,430
Let go of my child.

228
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,010
Let go of my child!

229
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,930
Let go of my child.

230
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,440
Let go of my child!

00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,620
Hello.

232
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,440
We are investigators from Sheen Genome Institute.

233
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,420
We'd like to ask Fang Yuan some questions.

234
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,630
I need to check with his parents.

235
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,680
Please wait a moment.

236
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,100
Cheng Nuo.

237
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,550
Fang Yuan.

238
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,190
We are investigators from Sheen Genome Institute.

239
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,130
No need to introduce us.

240
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,030
We've met before.

241
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:19,940
Right?

242
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,500
Let me show you something.

243
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:28,290
Take a look.

244
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,680
Do you know this deceased person?

245
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,010
Can you speak?

246
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:39,930
Hey.

247
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,040
Why do you have no response at all?

248
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:41,380
Cheng Nuo.

249
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,460
What are you doing here?

250
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,770
How could you barge in here?

251
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,300
What are you going to do to him?

252
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,270
I just asked him a few questions.

253
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,090
About what?

254
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,260
What my son did was legitimate self-defense.

255
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,190
He didn't do anything wrong.

256
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,290
Stop pestering him.

257
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,930
We'll cooperate with the police to find out

258
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,540
if what your son did was legitimate self-defense.

259
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,400
Please leave.

260
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,690
Has he always been silent like this?

261
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,360
Get out!

262
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,660
Cheng Nuo, let’s go.

263
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,410
Cheng Nuo.

264
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,230
Sorry.

265
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,110
Do you think he's normal like that?

266
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:14,760
He hasn't said a word

267
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,590
since the incident, has he?

268
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,670
You scared him just now.

269
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,010
He's just a child.

270
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,250
He just wanted to protect his mother.

271
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,980
How could you call him a murderer?

272
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,330
And isn't what we need to confirm

273
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,980
if the victim was a humanoid?

274
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,460
Why do you keep pestering the kid?

275
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,570
The dead won't speak.

276
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,620
They said they didn't know the attacker.

277
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:28,530
Chen Xinhui said that.

278
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,250
Fang Yuan hasn't said anything yet.

279
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:29,780
Does it matter?

280
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,430
Yes.

281
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,340
Can you only solve the cases by hurting people?

282
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,720
Then you can try your method.

283
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,580
Fang Yuan,

284
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,210
I will protect you.

285
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,400
With Mommy here,

286
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,720
you won't need to worry about anything.

287
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,420
It's okay.

288
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,670
It's all right.

Okay.

calls our nanny every day.

00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,820
I understand. It's just a process.

296
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,640
You should spend more time with him.

297
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,250
Don't give him too much pressure.

I won't beat around the bush.

that we'd like to ask you to help us with.

314

Go back first.

323

Let go of me!

324

It's okay, Ms. Zhang.

I understand.

But

this case is a bit special.

330

The one who's involved 
is a ten-year-old child.

331

He killed someone

332
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,570
to protect his mother.

Let me take you in.

337

Okay.

339
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:43,900
Sit here.

341

I'm sorry.

342
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,370
My colleague was too impulsive last time.

343
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,250
But don't worry.

344
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,760
We won't discuss the case this time.

345
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,950
We're worried

346
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,420
that after experiencing these things,

347
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,080
Fang Yuan would be too stressed mentally.

348
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,270
So I specifically invited

349
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,420
an expert in psychology.

350
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,730
I hope she can help Fang Yuan.

351
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,240
Hello, Ms. Chen.

352
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,190
My name is An Qiu.

353
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,359
Can I chat with Fang Yuan?

354
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,730
Hello, Fang Yuan.

355
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,550
Can I chat with you?

356
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,750
If you don't say no,

357
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,480
can I take it as a yes?

358
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,900
Fang Yuan.

359
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,220
Actually, compared to this case,

360
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:28,430
we care more about you.

361
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,500
But if you keep silent,

362
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,920
we don't know how to help you.

363
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,550
It's okay, Fang Yuan.

364
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,780
I totally understand how you feel.

365
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,560
How about this?

366
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,540
Let's play a little game.

367
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,200
We don't need to talk in this game.

368
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,560
You know what?

369
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,440
I became a psychologist

370
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,740
because I have psychic powers.

371
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,120
I am telepathic.

372
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,500
Do you want to try?

373
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,900
Let me play with you first.

374
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,700
Sure.

375
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,510
The game is very simple.

376
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,350
This game is called Black Magic.

377
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,340
Ms. Chen,

378
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,430
please point any position on Fang Yuan

379
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,450
for Mr. Shen.

380
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,450
And then,

381
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,140
I'll tell you the answer

382
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,220
using my power of telepathy.

383
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,180
Let's get started.

384
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,970
Ms. Chen, you may begin.

385
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:19,790
Okay.

386
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:27,900
Are you done?

387
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,790
Yes.

388
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,640
Mr. Shen, please cooperate.

389
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:34,490
No problem.

390
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,090
Is this the place

391
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,440
Ms. Chen pointed at?

392
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,320
No.

393
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,520
Is it here?

394
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:49,870
No.

395
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,390
Is it here?

396
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:52,460
No.

397
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,100
Is it here?

398
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:55,960
No.

399
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:57,460
Then...

400
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,640
Is it here?

401
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:00,860
Yes.

402
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,590
Do you suspect

403
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,450
that Mr. Shen gave me some hints?

404
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,640
You must have discussed it beforehand

405
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,950
and agreed that the fifth one would be the correct answer.

406
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,710
It's not like that.

407
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,120
Did you communicate with your eyes?

408
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,330
Not really.

409
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,030
How about this?

410
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,490
Let's play again.

411
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,770
Think of your favorite dessert

412
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,260
and tell Mr. Shen only.

413
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,220
I won't look at you this time, either.

414
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:31,810
Come on.

415
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,010
Almond Jelly.

416
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,890
Is Fang Yuan's favorite dessert…

417
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:42,810
ice cream?

418
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,380
No.

419
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:45,710
Is it

420
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:46,820
Black Forest Cake?

421
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,550
No.

422
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,180
Is it Almond Jelly?

423
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,710
Yes.

424
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,430
Do you believe me now?

425
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,250
Actually,

426
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,030
besides telepathy,

427
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,170
I have another psychic power.

428
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,980
I can read your mind.

429
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,320
Do you want to try it?

430
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,260
I'm hungry.

431
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,260
I want to eat something.

432
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,610
Didn't you have breakfast before you came?

433
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,780
I want to eat more.

434
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,060
Okay, I'll buy some food for you.

435
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,430
Stay here and be good.

436
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:40,740
Do you want to continue?

437
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,470
Actually, you still want

438
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,330
to watch my telepathy.

439
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,420
Actually,

440
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,690
you don't want to eat at all.

441
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,500
You just made an excuse

442
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,590
to let her leave.

443
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,280
You don't want her

444
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,270
to hear what's on your mind.

445
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,390
She took good care of you.

446
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,840
But it also makes you feel pressured?

447
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,710
But you are

448
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,340
a very sensible kid.

449
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,580
You're willing to understand your mother,

450
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,430
right?

451
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,950
My mom used to be busy with work.

452
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,300
She barely had time to accompany me.

453
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,910
I don't blame her.

454
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,890
But she actually wanted to spend more time with you.

455
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,390
That's why she took you to a hot spring hotel.

456
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:36,890
But

457
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,990
what happened that day

458
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,550
made you sad all this time.

459
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,630
Right?

460
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,790
Yuan.

461
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,140
You're very brave.

462
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,610
You did nothing wrong.

463
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,500
You protected your mother.

464
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:57,770
So...

465
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,510
is protecting Mom the most important thing?

466
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:01,940
Of course.

467
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,580
You did cheat.

468
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,170
I don't know

469
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,290
how you did it,

470
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,160
but you are not telepathic at all.

471
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,950
You're here to cheat together with him.

472
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,170
Yuan.

473
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,750
Yuan.

474
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,850
Can you tell me

475
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,140
about this pocket watch?

476
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,800
What's wrong, Yuan?

477
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,400
Sorry, Ms. Chen.

478
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:32,790
Just now, he might...

479
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,450
Yuan.

480
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,700
Let's go home.

481
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,060
Ms. Chen.

482
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,600
Let's go.

483
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,030
Sorry, I didn't help much.

484
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,390
It's a great help that you came.

485
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,510
I think Fang Yuan does have something to say.

486
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,190
But maybe he has some concerns.

487
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,120
Instead, I think

488
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,700
Chen Xinhui's reaction is a bit strange.

489
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,460
Is it whether your finger touched him?

490
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,320
What are you talking about?

491
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,910
The game you just played.

492
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,590
Or it's a physical hint.

493
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,480
This is my partner, Cheng Nuo.

494
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,820
This is my junior in college, An Qiu.

495
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,260
She is a top student majoring in psychology.

496
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:19,930
Hello.

497
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,390
Or it is that you discussed

498
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,340
before you went in.

499
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,450
The answer is predetermined.

500
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,970
Stop guessing. They are all wrong.

501
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:25,830
Wrong?

502
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:27,570
Then what is it?

503
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,050
Didn't you see it all

504
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,300
in the surveillance room just now?

505
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,440
You still don't get it?

506
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,800
This is actually a game

507
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,160
we often play when we do psychotherapy.

508
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,650
The principle is very simple.

509
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,700
Just make a mark…

510
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,660
I knew it.

511
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,380
You must have made a mark on the answers.

512
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:40,830
Right?

513
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,190
Of course not.

514
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:44,850
Answers always vary.

515
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,950
If it's not the case,

516
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:47,610
then where do you mark?

517
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,730
Think about it.

518
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,960
I'll see her off.

519
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:51,790
I have something else to do.

520
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,760
What's before the answer?

521
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,400
Think about it.

522
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,630
Still thinking about the answer?

523
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,890
Do you really think I'm stupid?

524
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,710
The option before the right answer

525
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,110
is something black.

526
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,960
This game is called Black Magic, right?

527
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,710
Are you suspecting Chen Xinhui?

528
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,080
[Chen Xinhui, Chairman of Yige Xinyuan Clothing Co., Ltd.]

529
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,080
[Profession: Entrepreneur]

530
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:17,810
Yes.

531
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,810
Do you remember the surveillance footage?

532
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,990
That crazy woman knocked on so many doors.

533
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,970
Why did only Chen Xinhui open the door?

534
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,440
I don't think

535
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,800
they were unrelated

536
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,800
as Chen Xinhui claimed.

537
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,810
Look.

538
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,870
This is Chen Xinhui's call record this year.

539
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,170
Except for Fang Yuan's teacher,

540
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,770
she has barely contacted anyone else.

541
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:34,990
Maybe

542
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,150
she focused only

543
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,370
on her child?

544
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:40,800
Look.

545
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,090
So she often goes out?

546
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,110
It doesn't match with the previous information.

547
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:48,620
It does.

548
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,090
It's true that she often went out.

549
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,270
It's also true that she doesn't like to leave home.

550
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:53,820
Chen Xinhui and her husband

551
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,690
once ran a clothing trade company.

552
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,510
After her husband died of illness,

553
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,620
she was the only one managing it.

554
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,740
The profit was quite good.

555
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,120
However, three years ago,

556
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,370
she suddenly sold the company.

557
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,610
She didn't start another business

558
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,370
or work since then.

559
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,290
She stayed at home.

560
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,120
Of course,

561
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,690
the money she earned before

562
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,550
is enough for their daily expenses.

563
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,330
So,

564
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,520
she suddenly changed her personality

565
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,370
three years ago.

566
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:31,580
Yuan.

567
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:32,920
Here.

568
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,610
Have some fruit, okay?

569
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,230
Here.

570
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,120
I'll make you juice, okay?

571
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,430
Have you been in touch with Chen Xinhui lately?

572
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:58,400
She suddenly borrowed money from me a while ago,

573
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,120
but I didn't have that much money.

574
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,420
She just threw a tantrum at me.

575
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,550
Ms. Chen?

576
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,050
She hasn't been here for a long time.

577
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:04,810
In the past,

578
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,740
she often came here to have dinner with her colleagues.

579
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,170
She still hasn't finish

580
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,380
the wine she saved here

581
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,440
and the balance of the membership card.

582
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,630
How long haven't you been in touch with Chen Xinhui?

583
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,730
A few years.

584
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,300
So she didn't go back to your hometown

585
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,180
when your father passed away?

586
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,290
No, she didn't.

587
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,350
Don't bring these things up again, okay?

588
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,050
They are all in the past.

589
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,110
I heard from our friends

590
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,260
that she sold the company

591
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,010
and scolded her partner.

592
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,070
Have you visited her at her house?

593
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,050
Yes.

594
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,550
There seemed to be someone living there,

595
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,140
but

596
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,730
she didn't open the door when I went there.

597
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,580
We haven't been in touch since then.

598
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,310
In about three years,

599
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,810
not only did she sell the company,

600
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,340
but also fell out

601
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,340
with all the relatives and friends.

602
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,510
And she had various reasons to fall out with them.

603
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,100
She borrowed money from her friends.

604
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,340
That's understandable.

605
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,690
But her brother said

606
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:48,860
when her father died,

607
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,090
she didn't even attend the funeral.

608
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,040
That doesn't make sense.

609
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,410
Maybe she has a secret 
she doesn't want others to know.

610
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:56,870
Cheng Nuo,

611
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,040
this is the autopsy result 
Director Wan asked me to give you.

612
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:03,940
I knew it.

613
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,110
What is this?

614
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,150
This is the autopsy report of the deceased.

615
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,320
Come here.

616
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,830
[Appraisal Report]

617
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,830
[According to the autopsy, a stab in the abdomen caused spleen rupture and loss…]

618
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,830
[Smoke residue was found in the lungs, showing inhalation of a lot of smoke before dying]

619
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,050
According to the autopsy report,

620
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,450
the deceased had been taking hallucinogenic drugs for a long time

621
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:13,170
[The blood test shows that the deceased had been taking hallucinogenic drugs for a long time]

622
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:13,170
[The deceased had symptoms of muscular atrophy and malnutrition]

623
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,860
and suffering from malnutrition

624
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,370
and muscular atrophy before she died.

625
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,920
She was probably imprisoned.

626
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,020
Do you remember

627
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,950
what Ms. Wang from the hotel said?

628
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,460
Then I heard loud noises.

629
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,120
She said she heard someone screaming,

630
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,090
"Let go of my child.

631
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,730
Let go of my child!"

632
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,760
If we understand it literally,

633
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,050
we subconsciously believe

634
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,410
Chen Xinhui said it.

635
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,990
But I listened to the recording carefully

636
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,930
and found something was wrong 
with the tone of it.

637
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,990
Let go of my child.

638
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,980
Let go of MY child!

639
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,010
She stressed "my"

640
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,260
instead of "let go."

641
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,720
So I think

642
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,780
that crazy woman should be the one who said it.

643
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,530
That's the real Chen Xinhui.

644
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,480
Okay, it's clear now.

645
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,830
Sign it.

646
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:04,090
Cheng Nuo,

647
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,300
shouldn't we

648
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,130
be more cautious before we sign it?

649
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,090
Fang Yuan is just a kid.

650
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,350
If we take away his only family,

651
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,440
I'm afraid he won't be able 
to take such a huge blow.

652
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,330
-Besides, Chen Xinhui...
-Are you speaking for a humanoid?

653
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,340
Have you ever thought

654
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,070
what this result means to them?

655
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,410
That is not what I should think about.

656
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,760
Nor you.

657
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,280
You just need to judge

658
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,460
if the target is a humanoid. That's all.

659
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:43,700
So,

660
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,740
is protecting Mom the most important thing?

661
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:47,740
Of course.

662
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,660
You did cheat.

663
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,150
I don't know how...

664
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,200
Protecting Mom...

665
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,520
[Is protecting Mom the most important thing?]

666
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,900
Hello, Senior.

667
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,070
I want to leave Sheen Genome Institute.

668
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,230
Why?

669
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:21,850
You remember my partner Cheng Nuo, right?

670
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,480
The difference between humanoids and human beings

671
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,830
is just the initial obsession.

672
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,440
It's the foundation of all the behaviors

673
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,810
and emotions of humanoids.

674
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,590
It is like an instinct.

675
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,990
The purpose of Sheen Genome Institute is to cooperate with the police

676
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,460
to identify and search for humanoids.

677
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,350
But we need to give them care at the same time.

678
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:46,110
However, Cheng Nuo is different.

679
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:48,970
He has been very hostile

680
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,230
towards humanoids.

681
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,360
In order to identify a humanoid,

682
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,860
he's willing to do everything.

683
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,860
But humanoids

684
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,490
are not robots.

685
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,890
They look the same as us.

686
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,200
They can be any one of us.

687
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:09,720
Every time I searched for a humanoid,

688
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,690
I met a group of people

689
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,010
who were emotionally connected with it.

690
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,560
If the humanoid disappears,

691
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,690
their lives will be completely changed too.

692
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,120
We need to correct

693
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,660
people's over-reliance on humanoids.

694
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,610
But this process

695
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,420
makes me feel pressured.

696
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:30,610
I'm sorry

697
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,640
for making you listen to my complaints.

698
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,330
It's okay.

699
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,470
Senior.

700
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,580
Whether we work as an investigator 
or a psychologist,

701
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:43,000
the purpose of our jobs is to make people

702
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,290
accept the fact.

703
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,990
Some people gave up on themselves,

704
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,280
but we can't give up on them.

705
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,930
Hang in there.

706
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,790
Maybe a favorable turn will come soon.

707
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,720
Thank you.

708
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,140
An Qiu,

709
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:01,880
actually,

710
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,310
I think you are more suitable for this job than me.

711
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:07,740
Wait.

712
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,000
Look at this.

713
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:15,650
[Seasonal Recruitment]

714
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,600
I saw it all

715
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,370
when you talked to Fang Yuan.

716
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,600
If you work with Cheng Nuo,

717
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,570
he may become different.

718
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:24,760
Really?

719
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,670
I thought I didn't help much.

720
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,030
By the way,

721
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,510
What's the final result

722
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,500
of Fang Yuan's case?

723
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:32,490
Almost done.

724
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,230
We might make a final confirmation tomorrow.

725
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,930
Actually, I'm quite worried about Fang Yuan.

726
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,970
Can I have a look tomorrow?

727
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:12,950
Mr. Shen,

728
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:13,890
a lady is looking for you outside.

729
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:14,440
Okay.

730
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,260
An Qiu.

731
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,230
Why are the police here?

732
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,670
Chen Xinhui disappeared.

733
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,260
What happened?

734
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,120
Chen Xinhui

735
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,230
is confirmed to be a humanoid.

736
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,200
Where did that humanoid go?

737
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,830
I've asked you for almost 30 minutes.

738
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,630
-You won't say anything, right?
-Captain.

739
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,080
I found a secret door in the living room.

740
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,040
Come and take a look.

741
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,110
Okay. Coming.

742
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,090
Take care of Fang Yuan for me.

743
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,680
Okay.

744
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,220
I knew it.

745
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:13,610
Yuan.

746
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,410
It'll be easier

747
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,760
to tell us everything.

748
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,860
Let me ask you one last time.

749
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,010
Where is that humanoid?

750
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,460
At this point,

751
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,390
what are you still hiding?

752
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,010
Can you stop talking to a kid like this?

753
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,200
Do you know what he did?

754
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:28,120
That victim was his mother.

755
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,360
We have done a DNA test

756
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,340
for the deceased in the hot spring hotel,

757
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:33,680
him, and his mother.

758
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,500
The result shows that

759
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,460
the victim was also Chen Xinhui.

760
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,540
One of them must be a humanoid.

761
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,910
You won't tell, will you?

762
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,120
Let me help you recall the whole process.

763
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,090
I guess

764
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,150
your mother was too busy with work,

765
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:57,960
so she customized a humanoid in the Old Street

766
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,300
who looked exactly like her

767
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,360
to take care of you for her.

768
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,170
Her initial obsession

769
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,860
must be nice to you

770
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,080
and obey you unconditionally.

771
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,570
Stop.

772
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,550
Your mother had high expectations of you,

773
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,510
which made you feel stressed out.

774
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,639
That was a kind of love.

775
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,989
But in the eyes of the humanoid,

776
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,630
it was a kind of harm.

777
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,199
The humanoid was no longer satisfied

778
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:20,600
with being a substitute mother.

779
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:22,040
She thought she was more qualified

780
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:22,880
to be your mother.

781
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,210
Yuan, I'm going to work.

782
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,040
-Stay home and listen to Auntie.
-But it's not easy

783
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:30,040
to replace a human.

784
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:31,630
At first,

785
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,060
it was just basic imitation.

786
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,010
Yuan.

787
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,670
I'm going to work.

788

793
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,000
and listen to Auntie at home.

794
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:50,860
Thank you.

795
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:53,100
The humanoid put drugs

796
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,610
into the food and water every day.

797
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,010
Gradually,

798
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,100
something went wrong with your mother's health.

799
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,810
At the same time,

800
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,890
she started her scheme to replace her.

801
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,900
Ms. Chen, are you sure 
you want to sell the company?

802
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,980
To avoid being discovered by someone 
who was familiar with Ms. Chen,

803
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,540
she took the initiative

804
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,030
and found out the points of discord
between your mother and her family and friends

805
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,700
to cut ties with everyone.

806
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,180
Can you understand me?

807
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,150
I'm in charge now.

808
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,500
I can't go back.

809
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:22,670
Yuan.

810
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,940
I've already fired that nanny.

811
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,740
I'll take care of you wholeheartedly from now on.

812
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,410
Humanoids may not dare to kill humans.

813
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:48,850
So she kept your mother

814
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:49,840
in the basement.

815
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,740
Your mom was drugged,

816
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,790
so she was sometimes sober 
and sometimes confused.

817
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,000
Can...

818
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:15,750
Can I ask you a question?

819
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:18,630
When…

820
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,970
When I've been away,

821
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,210
has Fang Yuan been well?

822
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,300
Is he happy?

823
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,320
Did…

824
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,980
Did he miss his mom?

825
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,160
I am his mom.

826
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,660
He's very happy now.

827
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,300
I won't do anything that upsets him.

829
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,330
On the day of the incident, there was a thunderstorm.

830
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:36,920
The door of the basement

831
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,350
opened by itself,

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,770

Mom, what's going on?

00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,300
It's okay. Let me go take a look.

You didn't kill her, did you?

844
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,500
It's the humanoid who did it.

845
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,160
I don't understand

846
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:05,160
why you still insist that you did it.

847

She's abandoned you,

yet you still care about her.

849
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:09,460
She won't abandon me.

850
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,500
Why not?

Are you so sure

00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:14,750
her initial obsession was to take care of you?

854

Maybe it's becoming another Chen Xinhui.

855
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,140
That's why

856
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:19,260
she got rid of the real one

857
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,320

00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,740
-are just a tool used by her.
-Nonsense!

860
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,080
It wasn't planned.

861
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,730
She didn't mean it.

862
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:27,880
Then why did you lie?

863
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,730
What on earth happened?

864
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,430
Cheng Nuo.

865
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,890
Yuan. Don't be afraid. Don't be sad.

866
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,400
Only by learning the truth

867
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,720
can we help you.

868
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,390
Can you tell us

869
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,780
what happened that night?

870
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,040
Yuan.

871
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,610
What should we do?

872
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,290
I didn't mean it.

873
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,620
I didn't know my mom

874
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,250
who'd been with me

875
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:04,830
was the humanoid mom until that night.

876
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,600
I'm sorry, Yuan.

877
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:43,800
I'm too busy.

878
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,640
I don't have time to take care of you.

879
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:48,730
Here, this is a small gift

880
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,130
to congratulate you on your award.

881
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,700
I've already lost a mother.

882
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:58,190
I just don't want to lose another one.

883
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,570
That day, you asked me

884
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:10,370
if protecting Mom was the most important thing.

885
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,470
You must have blamed yourself.

886
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,060
But I was right.

887
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,520
You're very brave, Yuan.

888
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,130
You just protected your other mother.

889
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,600
Other mother?

890
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,340
That being said,

891
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,740
she still left when she was most needed.

892
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,330
Yuan.

893
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:36,180
She won't leave for no reason.

894
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:38,630
You know what she went to do, right?

895
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,370
Will Mom get a legal identity?

896
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:49,550
What do you mean?

897
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,090
She received a phone call

898
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,260
from a stranger today.

899
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:56,610
He said he knew

900
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:57,490
our secret.

901
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,170
He can help us.

902
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:01,860
Do you know

903
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,990
where they're meeting?

904
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,270
In the forest park.

905

The case in which a boy saved his mother

913
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,740
has taken a surprising twist.

914

[Breaking News, Xiyuan City]

915
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:30,270
The ten-year-old boy was so overly dependent on a humanoid

916
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:31,510
that he hid from the police

917
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:33,750
the crime that the humanoid killed his mother.

918
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:44,100
The patient inhaled too much smoke,

919
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,790
causing cerebral hypoxia and ischemia.

920
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:47,490
He's still in a coma.

921
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:49,850
If the coma lasts too long,

922
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:51,950
he might have sequelae.

923
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:58,930
Why didn't you save him?

924
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:02,200
If you hadn't run away,

925
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:04,480
he might not be lying here.

926
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,120
I ran away

927
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,750
to catch the suspect.

928
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:10,430
Really?

929
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:12,750
Did you catch the suspect?

930
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:16,730
To you,

931
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:19,350
catching the suspect is more important than saving people.

932
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:20,570
Right?

933
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:22,330
I believe Shen Li

934
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,070
-would've made the same choice.
-You're wrong.

935
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:27,620
He would've chosen to save you.
