1
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,469
Are you okay, bro? Why are you making that weird face?

2
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,400
You two are studying here?

3
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,677
Yes, why?

4
00:00:38,678 --> 00:00:40,200
Are you sure you're all right?

5
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,020
Do you need to go to the first aid room? Your face looks pale.

6
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:51,760
I'm all right but... err...

7
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,070
I'm not familiar with your faces at all.

8
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,000
Are you two...

9
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,750
Are you two...

10
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,250
What are we? Finish it.

11
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,891
Calm down, dude.

12
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,990
Bro, if you have anything to say, just take your time.

13
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,560
We're here to listen to you.

14
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,860
Are you two....

15
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,530
together?

16
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,860
Yes, right!

17
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,940
Why? You've got a crush on my boyfriend?

18
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,810
I'm sorry for you,

19
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,280
my boyfriend only has eyes for me.

20
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,650
Come on, dude.

21
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,170
Is he all right?

22
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,110
Hey, bro, watch out...

23
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,589
Come on, Type!

24
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,240
What an attractive boy!

25
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,510
Stop your damn smiling!

26
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:48,630
You know I have had only you ever since.

27
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:53,500
You told me your motto was... "There's only one you."

28
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,609
I give five on my confidence, I give ten on my looks.

29
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,210
I give over a hundred on how clingy my boyfriend is with me.

30
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,769
Try cheating on me!

31
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,270
Nah, more like you.

32
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,200
There're some juniors having a crush on you lately.

33
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,600
Because your wifey is the best!

34
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,800
Yeah, you better know you're a wifey.

35
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,655
Don't be silly. Even though they want to be my wives,

36
00:03:25,655 --> 00:03:28,930
it doesn't mean I want to be their hubby.

37
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:35,241
Plus, having you is already a pain in the neck for me.

38
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,270
Anyway, I'm concerned about that boy.

39
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,760
What's wrong with him?

40
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,500
But I'm concerned about you more.

41
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,760
Someone will see!

42
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,520
♫ I used to miss the old love and I dreamed of him often ♫

43
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,540
♫ Waiting for the day to meet ♫

44
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,830
♫ I don't know who that person is,
the imaginary one in my mind ♫

♫ Well, it doesn't look like you ♫

46
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,890
♫ Is this love? Or is this just a broken heart? ♫

47
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:24,880
♫ I've fallen into a hole, swarming like a dream ♫

♫ A true story or miracle are hard to resist ♫

49

♫ If this is love, then what should I do? ♫

50
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:41,570
♫ What if I can't control my heart?
And what should I do if you know? ♫

[Why R U - The Series]

53
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,749
Tutor, what time is it?

54
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,389
Probably 4:00 p.m. already.

55
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,800
And why are you not going home yet?

56
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,510
You don't have any classes, do you?

57
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:46,780
Yes, but I have a tutorial and am waiting for Hwahwa, too.

58
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,649
Hwahwa is coming?

59
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,980
Right.

60
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,249
What time?

61
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,410
Maybe evening, after I finish tutoring.

62
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,380
What's going on?

63
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,621
Let me ask you something.

64
00:06:05,622 --> 00:06:07,922
Go ahead.

65
00:06:10,092 --> 00:06:12,422
Do you really like Hwahwa?

66
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:20,709
What makes you think so?

67
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,650
Because you don't have a girlfriend,

68
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,280
plus you are always with her.

69
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,070
You also take care of her very well

70
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,740
and do everything she wants.

71
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,450
That's why I asked.

72
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,050
Why are you silent? Or do you really like her?

73
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,249
Well, I think I don't like her that way.

74
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:54,350
I guess because I grew up with her, we have a deep bond.

75
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,199
You sure?

76
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,600
Sure.

77
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,223
It's good that you don't.

78
00:07:09,223 --> 00:07:15,040
Because if you liked her, you would get hurt from seeing her

79
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,450
dating other guys and never being the chosen one.

80
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,551
- What's up?
- What's up?

81
00:07:27,551 --> 00:07:29,140
You didn't come to class this morning.

82
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,140
I kept a space for you, turned out you didn't show up.

83
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,550
I woke up late. Sorry, dude.

84
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,534
Why are you still here, Tutor? You don't have any classes.

85
00:07:39,534 --> 00:07:41,350
Waiting for Hwahwa.

86
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,510
Ooh... waiting for her.

87
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,380
Dudes, have you heard the news from the Cute Boy Facebook page?

88
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,680
What news?

89
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,080
Is it Cute Boy collaborating with Soccer Club news?

90
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:04,030
Hello, everyone, you're now watching the "Chemistry Cute Boy" show.

91
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,949
Or you can say the "Cute Boy Who has the Best Chemistry" show.

92
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:12,430
Absolutely, we're now keeping an eye on the poll to see who gets how many votes.

93
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,690
I've heard that Saifah is the front-runner.

94
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,690
Apparently, he is.

95
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:21,150
What about my Zon? I'm his big fan, what are his scores now?

96
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,069
Zon is mounting a comeback.

97
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,590
But last night, his sister, Zol,

98
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:32,450
uploaded a fiction with an NC scene and poll's link.

99
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,930
I think he can make it.

100
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:39,829
Actually, I want to skip to tonight because I really want to know who's going to win.

101
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,469
I won't accept any unexpected results because I already imagined that

102
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,469
they are looking at each other in the eyes and playing guitar together.

103
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,470
And if it doesn't happen as imagined, it would be just a dream.

104
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:51,210
I'm praying for that too because we've been imagining them for so long.

105
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,490
So loooong.

106
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:58,370
It's quite doubtful because they don't really meet in real life.

107
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,750
But Zol is writing fiction about them or maybe...

108
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:08,389
Maybe, maybe she knows that her brother is seeing someone

109
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:12,670
and she is into that, so she's writing fiction to express her feelings.

110
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,710
Or they are secretly dating.

111
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:19,340
Right, and they can't tell anyone

112
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,990
so they're pretending that they don't know each other here.

113
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,431
Aww, this is so Yaoi-fiction.

114
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:29,969
- Hello, I'm Natee.
- I'm Junior.

115
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,669
Not now guys, sorry!

116
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,670
Hello, Soda. Hello, Luktarn.

117
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,390
Hello, Soda, why are you so beautiful.

118
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,790
Speaking of that, I'm already beautiful every day. Don't worry.

119
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,490
I agree with that.

120
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,029
Oh, I almost forget. Hello, Luktum.
(T/N: Luktum means kettlebell)

121
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,290
My name is LUKTARN!

122
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,170
Oh, sorry. I misunderstood because of your size.

123
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,730
Okay, let me repeat again,

124
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,390
we're keeping an eye on the polls.

125
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,229
Well, what are the latest updates on the polls?

126
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,930
Did anyone vote for me and Junior?

127
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,709
Yes, a few. Why?

128
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:07,620
I'm afraid I will win this.

129
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,290
Because If I win, I don't want to play guitar and sing.

130
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,071
- How come?
- I'm afraid I'll be more famous than now.

131
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:17,170
It's already hard living my life nowadays.

132
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,890
Feel free to cyberbully him.

133
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:25,730
Hey, starboy, you don't have to worry because the frontrunner is...

134
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:26,909
Junior it is.

135
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:28,530
It's Saifah, not you!

136
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,430
What the heck!? Why not me?

137
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:36,030
Soda who's the frontrunner and not in the club?

138
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:41,390
No one else except Zon, you guys friend.

139
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,590
What!? Zon?

140
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,610
He never joins any activities, you think he would join this?

141
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,770
He has to because everyone voted for him, right?

142
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,930
- Yes, he can not deny it.
- I have an offer for you.

143
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:59,280
If you let me take you out

144
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,700
and hold hands while dating,

145
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,550
I'll convince him for you.

146
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:11,490
Never mind, I'll talk to Zon myself.

147
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,010
But, but, but...

148
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,660
if you can't make it,

149
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,480
you still have me as a choice.

150
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,089
Okay, Junior and Natee.

151
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,490
Go to class.

152
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,190
Don't forget to vote for Natee!

153
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,770
Don't forget to vote for Junior!

154
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,330
Well, we will come back with

155
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,780
the polls after this.

156
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:36,410
For now, goodbye.

157
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:40,410
What a pity! Fighter and Tutor won't join this activity for sure.

158
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:41,460
But that's okay,

159
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,160
I still have Saifah and Zon.

160
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,880
Truth!

161
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,630
Hey! Did you hear me?

162
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,560
Is it that tasty?

163
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,190
Why? I like it since I was a kid.

164
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:02,250
It doesn't match your possible future being a university soccer player.

165
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,600
That doesn't make sense.

166
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,080
I can eat lollipops and be a soccer player.

167
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,180
Can I ask you for real, why you chose the Soccer Club?

168
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,850
You really like playing soccer?

169
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:22,360
Everyone says this.

170
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,420
But I understand,

171
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,690
it's because I'm weak.

172
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,040
Well, never mind.

173
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,176
I'll be supporting you.

174
00:12:33,176 --> 00:12:34,450
Okay...

175
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,890
Hey. Hey, Zon!

176
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:39,330
Oh! Have you been putting a lotion on lately? Your skin is so white.

177
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,630
What?

178
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,870
Is he here? He is here to copy documents!

179
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,970
Why did you hit me like this?

180
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,650
You too. Don't remind me.

181
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,330
- You stupid.
- Oh, dear!

182
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,430
Why are you late?

183
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:55,150
Oh ho, I had to wait for Junior. He was flirting with Soda.

184
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,449
Oh, ho, talk politely.

185
00:12:57,449 --> 00:12:59,749
How about it? Did she agree?

186
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,050
Who am I? I am Junior.

187
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,270
- So, did she agree?
- No!

188
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,950
She didn't even know that I hit on her seriously.

189
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,100
You deserve it. You are not serious with it, that's why she doesn't know that.

190
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,149
If you are so smart, then you do it!!

191
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,231
Dumb.

192
00:13:16,231 --> 00:13:19,090
- Our gang doesn't want people like you.
- Doesn't want you close to us.

193
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,550
The coward, leave our gang! Leave our gang! Leave our gang!!

194
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,690
Stop!!

195
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,660
- Both of you are gang up on me, don't you?
- Yes.

196
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,510
Just blame me! I still get hurt, you also choir at me too.

197
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,410
Remember it!

198
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,150
Hey! What's wrong with Zon?

199
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,690
I think he is serious about something.

200
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,120
There is always only one truth!

201
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,810
Hey, you guys.

202
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:48,990
Why did you shoot him? You have to shoot at Zon.

203
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,050
I am just a beginner. I wasn't accurate.

204
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,349
You are so stupid.

205
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:54,949
He doesn't say anything and he also sleeps.

206
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:56,290
Let's him sleep.

207
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,406
He won't cover our camera. We are too handsome.

208
00:13:58,406 --> 00:14:00,166
Hey, Tee.

209
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,130
What are you doing?

210
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,420
I am drawing.

211
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,050
Is it cute?

212
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,890
Who are they?

213
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,660
No one.

214
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,190
I just...

215
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,540
draw with my imagination.

216
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,090
Is it good?

217
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,680
It is all right.

218
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,030
They are protagonists of some Yaoi fiction, right?

219
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,530
Yes, they are a couple.

220
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,940
These too, they are a couple.

221
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,680
You and Saifah,

222
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,710
also a couple.

223
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,000
Fighter and Tutor,

224
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,440
are also a couple.

225
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,570
Do you understand?

226
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,350
You are dreaming!

227
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:29,730
Rival Couple. Rival Couple. Rival Couple. Rival Couple

228
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:48,410
Why are you shouting, student?

229
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,270
No one focus on my teaching. Class is over!! I don't want to teach anymore.

230
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,220
You said it yourself. Yeahhh! Wow! Huhhh!

231
00:15:55,690 --> 00:16:01,340
Go back home, back home.

232
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,740
Everyone!

233
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,560
Yes!

234
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,260
Zon, are you in a hurry?

235
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,050
I am in a hurry.

236
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,530
Go. Go.

237
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,359
Why did you shoot him again?

238
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:31,500
Let's go!! Leave him here.

239
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,540
- The third gratitude.
- Magnificent and bright.

240
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,520
Sleep well.

241
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,460
Too bad your such an easy target.

242
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,920
It is delicious.

243
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,440
Can I get it one more?

244
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,310
You guys!

245
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,120
What do you want?

246
00:17:39,908 --> 00:17:41,691
Can I ask you something?

247
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:43,470
What do you want to ask?

248
00:17:43,934 --> 00:17:47,930
Do you study here?

249
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,730
If we didn't,

250
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,160
you wouldn't see us here either.

251
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,120
Think carefully!

252
00:18:08,552 --> 00:18:10,230
Hey.

253
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,580
Hey.

254
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,900
I apologize for my boyfriend.

255
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,500
As of lately, he has been moody.

256
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,890
Your boyfriend?

257
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,670
You mean…

258
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,940
That man?

259
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:47,100
It is a simbol between me and Tee.

260
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,320
He gave it to me the first time we met.

261
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,940
I am going now.

262
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,830
What happened?

263
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,960
I am in Yaoi fiction, right?

264
00:19:29,206 --> 00:19:34,740
Okay. As I've told you, the Trig exam will use this equation,

265
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,130
Pythagoras is used for finding out...

266
00:19:37,131 --> 00:19:39,639
Hey, Tutor!

267
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,940
Hey, Saifah.

268
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,357
He is your friend, isn't he? So handsome.

269
00:19:45,357 --> 00:19:47,086
What about me? I am not handsome, right?

270
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:49,052
You are the cutest boy.

271
00:19:49,053 --> 00:19:52,580
Okay. Today, this is your homework.

272
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,690
- Next time, bring it to me.
- Yes.

273
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,140
Okay. Today is finished.

274
00:19:58,141 --> 00:20:00,141
Hello.

275
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,220
Okay. Let me help.

276
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,620
- See you next time.
- Good bye.
- Bye.

277
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,519
Why did you come back here for, Saifah?

278
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,619
I have some business here.

279
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:23,119
What is your business?

280
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,619
Uhh, I went to...

281
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:26,620
Wait, my phone rang.

282
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,470
Hello, Hwahwa.

283
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:37,850
Okay. Okay. See you.

284
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,620
Fighter, I will meet Tutor first.

285
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,830
He might be finished teaching soon.

286
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:55,060
Okay. But why does he teach so much?

287
00:20:58,345 --> 00:21:03,230
That's it. I pity him.

288
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,850
He works very hard all the time.

289
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:11,250
Actually, he has a financial issue.

290
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,420
Their house was sold last year.

291
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,990
I only learned about it a month later.

292
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,900
Moreover, his family moves around all of the time,

293
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,130
so he had to move into a condo.

294
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:35,090
They just got him a condo.

295
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,560
At first, he wanted to drop out of some subjects

296
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:43,090
because he doesn't have enough money to pay for the tuition.

297
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,439
But he is lucky and got a scholarship from our school.

298
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:53,460
If you get 5 A's, you don't have to pay for some credits. That helps him a lot.

299
00:21:53,460 --> 00:22:01,220
Just taking a shower is hard for him. He doesn't ask for others' help.

300
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,850
I so pity him.

301
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,100
But I have a good idea now.

302
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,161
What is it?

303
00:22:11,161 --> 00:22:14,020
I want you to study English with him.

304
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:20,200
It can help him to earn more money and you will also pass the English test.

305
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,859
You think I am bad at English, don't you?

306
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:26,080
I didn't mean it.

307
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:32,330
I just think that you are his faculty senior and Tutor is my close friend, too.

308
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:35,580
If anything happens, we can help each other.

309
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,040
No, I don't agree with it.

310
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:44,210
Fighter... have a heart for him.

311
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,360
He works very hard.

312
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,860
We will discuss it later.

313
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,640
Now, let's meet him. He might be done with teaching.

314
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,260
Tutorrrrr!

315
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,090
Hi, Hwahwa.

316
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:05,940
Everyone is looking at you. Be quiet.

317
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,154
- I-I want you to...
- What do you want?

318
00:23:14,154 --> 00:23:16,153
Fighter.

319
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:28,140
Tutor, I just think that eating out together might be more fun. Let's go together.

320
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,000
Do you want to go?

321
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,979
Yes, I do.

322
00:23:30,979 --> 00:23:33,880
Then what about you?

323
00:23:37,101 --> 00:23:39,179
What did you say?

324
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:40,940
Let's go together.

325
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,139
Tutor, please go with me.

326
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:50,139
No, I won't.

327
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:52,540
Why don't you want to go with me?

328
00:23:53,444 --> 00:23:57,750
I just remembered that I have some work to do.

329
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:01,180
I have to do it first.

330
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,580
It isn't true.

331
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:08,530
I don't believe it. You lie. Are you mad at me?

332
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,939
No, I am not.

333
00:24:10,939 --> 00:24:13,760
If not, then let's go together.

334
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,480
I will force Fighter to pay for a meal.

335
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:24,060
I can't go. I have to do my work.

336
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,640
I don't believe it. Liar.

337
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,620
Why do you have sudden work?

338
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,000
I am mad at you.

339
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,680
Hwahwa, I have work today.

340
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,960
I'm not lying.

341
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:50,059
Okay. If you don't want to go today, it is okay because tomorrow I will have a birthday party.

342
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:53,179
We will celebrate my birthday and you teaching Fight.

343
00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:56,650
Then you have to go!!

344
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,940
Saifah, tomorrow is Saturday, isn't it?

345
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,200
Yes.

346
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,870
On Saturday, I have to teach.

347
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,770
I think I should go next time.

348
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:13,238
I promise I will pay for you. Is it okay?

349
00:25:13,238 --> 00:25:18,059
I get it. I am not important to you.

350
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:21,750
Tutor, you can reschedule your teaching. Right?

351
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,530
Last time, you rescheduled it, didn't you?

352
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,240
Damn.

353
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,950
Never mind, Saifah.

354
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:33,620
If I was important to him, he would go.

355
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,420
I will go.

356
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,200
Yeaah!!

357
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,500
You are so cute.

358
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:53,239
- Are you going to the condo now?
- Yes.

359
00:25:53,239 --> 00:25:56,284
Good. Then let's go together. Go

360
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:02,010
- But...
- Don't refuse me.

361
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:05,530
Your condo is on my way home.

362
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,520
Oh, Saifah. You live in the same condo with Tutor.

363
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,690
I think we should go together. Let's go together!!

364
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,270
Can I go with you?

365
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:26,530
Yes!! You all can go together with me.

366
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:36,420
Everyone, go first.

367
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:42,830
I will go... Nature calls.

368
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,309
Do you need my help?

369
00:26:55,309 --> 00:26:58,390
No, no. I am fine.

370
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,990
Okay.

371
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:06,800
Go first...

372
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,530
Are you sure?

373
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:11,420
See you later in the car.

374
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,700
I will follow.

375
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,130
Then I go first. Are you okay?

376
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,970
Okay.p

377
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,990
You follow me then. Saifah, follows me.

378
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,630
See you.

379
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,360
Hey, guys. Hwahwa's birthday is coming.

380
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,000
Do you know what she likes?

381
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,199
I don't know. You should ask Tutor.

382
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:02,399
Why don't you know this stuff, huh?

383
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:06,740
I have asked you nicely, Tutor.

384
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,200
Why do you get on my nerves?

385
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,630
Well, why don't you know about the simple things?

386
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:16,220
I'm here. I'm so sorry for letting you guys wait.

387
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,300
Many people were waiting to use the toilet. Phew!

388
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:35,540
Are you two fighting again?

389
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,200
Isn't that so, Saifah?

390
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,110
It's been about two years that you guys have been fighting.

391
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:49,020
Don't you get sick of it?

392
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:58,650
Well, whenever I ask this, you two always keep silent.

393
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,620
What is the matter?

394
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:06,380
I just want the two of you to become nicer.

395
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:10,370
Why can't it be? Huh!

396
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:25,090
Hwahwa, then, may I go back by myself?

397
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,870
Please, take care of Saifah.

398
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,910
Tutor!

399
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,670
Hey, Tutor!

400
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,470
Tutor!

401
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:39,684
When will you guys stop fighting over every little thing?

402
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:47,690
Don't you want to say something?

403
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:51,270
Is it because of Tutor?

404
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:59,270
If the friendship between Tutor and me makes you think we are more than friends,

405
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,820
I will keep more distance from Tutor for you.

406
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,820
Does my friend make you feel that uncomfortable?

407
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,860
What are you thinking, Hwahwa?

408
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:15,720
It is not about Tutor at all.

409
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,920
Do you know what you are thinking?

410
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,350
Don't you really know?

411
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,670
The reason behind what all I did

412
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:34,850
and all the effort I paid these days,

413
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,970
why I do that?

414
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,820
Because I love you.

415
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,520
Fighter...

416
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,120
I do really love you.

417
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:14,820
Listen! In the next few months, there will be an annual soccer competition.

418
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:20,569
If you want to be in the starting lineup, bring your friends and practice.

419
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:22,670
This is too small! Got it?

420
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,019
Understood!

421
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:26,120
Yes!!

422
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,519
As everyone knows, our club will organize a concert in order to do some fundraising.

423
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,169
We want to buy sports goods for children in the rural area.

424
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:36,569
So, I will tell you guys later what you have to do.

425
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:38,269
Saifah is absent again, why?

426
00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:41,569
I don't know! I haven't seen him.

427
00:31:41,569 --> 00:31:42,470
What should we do?

428
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,269
I don't know. How can I know?

429
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,069
What's wrong?

430
00:31:47,069 --> 00:31:48,119
Your hitting is too hard.

431
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:49,419
What were you talking about?

432
00:31:49,419 --> 00:31:50,569
No, no, nothing.

433
00:31:50,569 --> 00:31:53,010
Saifah doesn't come to practice.

434
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:55,120
And we don't know where he is.

435
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,969
Uh! Saifah. He got an injury on his leg. I don't know how long he's going to take a break.

436
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:01,360
Hey, are you kidding me?

437
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,570
Saifah hurt his leg?

438
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:06,169
Hey, what we're going to do? He is the main player on our team!

439
00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:08,370
One more time! Enough!

440
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:11,170
Stop talking. Listen to Champ.

441
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:15,270
Well, before we start this project,

442
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:18,510
I'm asking you to do your best.

443
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:22,650
No matter what year of college you are, if you work hard,

444
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:26,010
a chance to be in the starting lineup is not far.

445
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,920
We're done for today.

446
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,570
See you tomorrow at the same place. Done!

447
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,220
What's happening?

448
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,220
Hey, Zon!

449
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,770
Zon!

450
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,869
- Tutor!
- Yep!

451
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,070
It's the real you!

452
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:23,920
I think I'm traveling in a BL fiction.

453
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,670
Zon, I think you should calm down. There is nothing.

454
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,670
Really?

455
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:37,570
What if this thing was happening to you?

456
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:39,520
I think you are overthinking this.

457
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:45,270
Since I did that vow, many things have turned strange.

458
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:50,019
Honestly, I think you should not swear that with your sister.

459
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:54,170
If you didn't do it, you would not have to be like this.

460
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,970
You're thinking too much, dude.

461
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:01,119
This! Obviously, it's a plot in a BL fiction.

462
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,920
Why can't I stop overthinking?

463
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,270
You're overthinking! Stop thinking, go back home.

464
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,100
Hang on!

465
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:10,350
I want to tell you this. In my sister's fiction,

466
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:13,070
your name was written in it.

467
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,069
My name?

468
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:15,520
Yes.

469
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,570
Did you finish talking?

470
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,769
Let's go back home.

471
00:34:24,769 --> 00:34:26,990
Wait… Wait,

472
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:29,940
we can go back home but...

473
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:33,060
don't touch me.

474
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,670
Don't you think too much?

475
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,070
Go.

476
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,570
Then, go.

477
00:34:54,080 --> 00:35:00,220
[Did you see the Cute Boy Fanpage of our university?]

478
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,439
[The votes of these two are outstanding.]

479
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:09,670
[Hopefully, the result tonight will bring the two of them to be a part of the soccer club's singing project.]

480
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,400
[They are my biases, too. I will be announcing the result tomorrow morning.]

481
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:22,050
What the heck! How can I stay calm, Tutor?

482
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,279
[Are you feeling better, Tutor?]

483
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,950
[Tomorrow is my birthday, do not miss out.]

484
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:51,820
[How can I miss out my dear friend's birthday?]

485
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:02,819
[See you then! Please wear white, that's the theme. Don't need to bring a present.]

486
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:06,020
[Just come.]

487
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:14,020
[I have already prepared the present.]

488
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,279
[That's too much.]

489
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:28,020
[See you tomorrow, sweet dreams.]

490
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:41,520
[Well, Hwahwa… Day, he said he want to join the party.]

491
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,080
[Of course, that's no problem. See you, XOXO.]

492
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,479
Excuse me. Can I use the elevator first?

493
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,420
Sure, here you go.

494
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,119
Can I use the elevator first?

495
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,520
Of course.

496
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,219
Can I use the elevator first?

497
00:37:07,219 --> 00:37:10,049
All right, here you go.

498
00:37:10,049 --> 00:37:12,420
Okay, okay, here you g… o.

499
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,050
Okay, what?

500
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,820
Hi.

501
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,120
Hi.

502
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,680
Hi.

503
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:32,549
Saifah. Zon! May I take photos of you two?

504
00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:34,879
Sure!

505
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:38,749
Why do you need to take our photos? I think you don't need to do that.

506
00:37:38,749 --> 00:37:40,840
Then, you can take photos of me.

507
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:45,450
The one next to me, he's rather arrogant.

508
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:50,879
He might think he is a superstar of the university.

509
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:54,840
Do not quarrel like this. It looks a lot like Zol's fiction.

510
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,990
Perhaps, she wrote it based on a true story.

511
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,219
It's not like what you think.

512
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:08,620
It's all right not to take photos but we have voted for you two to be the imaginary couple of our university.

513
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:12,219
Actually, we are not feeling free to take that position.

514
00:38:12,219 --> 00:38:14,890
Nope, I really want to have that position,

515
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:18,050
but, my Zon, he is…

516
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:20,220
My Zon? What the heck!

517
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,749
My Zon is rather a shy boy, so he doesn't feel motivated to do.

518
00:38:27,749 --> 00:38:28,949
What the heck!!!

519
00:38:28,949 --> 00:38:33,949
Sorry about that, my Zon, he is prone to speaking rudely.

520
00:38:33,949 --> 00:38:37,330
That's fine. The elevator is here, I have to go now. I will vote for you two. Bye.

521
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,820
Bye.

522
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,380
Because of you, I missed the elevator.

523
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,380
Do you want to take the stairs?

524
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,850
No, I will take another way.

525
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:17,579
Saifah, you are just getting on my nerves, right?

526
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:20,250
What if he really takes the position?

527
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,280
That's just like what I vowed.

528
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:29,119
No, I'm just overthinking.

529
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,680
Zon.

530
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,710
Saifah.

531
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:42,350
Don't prank me like this.

532
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:44,219
Don't you really want to take the position with me?

533
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:47,320
Take the position with you? No, I won't.

534
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,020
It is the real you or the fake you from the fiction?

535
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:55,250
Stop haunting me.

536
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,480
Put yourself together, Zon.

537
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,900
I'm not in the fiction.

538
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:04,570
I'm not in the fiction.

539
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:07,080
Am I?

540
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:16,279
Darn it, did I become that overthinking?

541
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,700
Did anyone see me?

542
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:23,670
I shouldn't have made that vow with Zol.

543
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:26,680
Should I see a psychologist?

544
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:36,550
This is for you, Boong.

545
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:41,149
Oops, Kea. That's not mine.

546
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:45,850
Well, well, you know it well. Take it.

547
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,420
This one is for you, Tutor.

548
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,020
Thank you.

549
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:58,450
Anyway, could you please close the shop?

550
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:03,519
Umm, I can't. I have a date with my boyfriend. I have to go back now.

551
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:06,279
Don't worry, Boong. Leave it to me. I will close the shop for today.

552
00:41:06,279 --> 00:41:08,680
- Okay.
- Okay.

553
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:13,319
Kea, do you remember about the cake that I asked you about?

554
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:16,479
You can deduce the price of the ingredients directly from my wage.

555
00:41:16,479 --> 00:41:19,560
Oh, Tutor, that is not a problem.

556
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,460
You can use whatever is in this shop.

557
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:27,280
You have been working hard.

558
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,279
Thanks a lot, Kea.

559
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:32,380
By the way, please close the shop for us.

560
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:35,579
That one, Kea. Not me.

561
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:37,519
I'm counting on you, Tutor

562
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:40,019
Then, shall I leave now? I'm in hurry.

563
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:43,719
Stop! I'll go with you.

564
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:48,250
Take care, everyone. Bye!

565
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,320
Yay!

566
00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:03,490
Today is a good day. I wish Tutor and Fighter won't spoil the vibe! Amen!

567
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:06,669
- Is it that much?
- Oh, yeah.

568
00:43:06,669 --> 00:43:08,130
All right, I got it.

569
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:10,150
Make sure you don't.

570
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:15,410
If you don't think of mentorship, at least think of Hwahwa. It's her birthday

571
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:16,810
Hey!

572
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:19,010
Hello, Fighter

573
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:24,170
We've just talked.

574
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:34,630
Yes, I'm right here in front of the bar.

575
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:38,060
Okay, okay, I'll go in.

576
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:41,790
Let's go.

577
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,590
Why did you do that?

578
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,100
I did not! He did!

579
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,900
Let's go.

580
00:43:57,030 --> 00:44:00,949
Ouch! You're late! Tutor, where is the cake?

581
00:44:00,949 --> 00:44:02,310
Here. Here.

582
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:07,990
Fighter, you bring the cake to her, please.

583
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:11,830
- But.
- Shh.

584
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:15,470
Day, you watch my back. Let's go!

585
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:19,929
- Is it not too overboard?
- Let's just go now.

586
00:44:19,929 --> 00:44:24,610
Hurry up! Before she is drunk. Go, go!

587
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,290
♫ I'm shaken every time you look at me ♫

588
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:39,830
♫ It seems like something is pulling me ♫

589
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:46,500
♫ I can't take it and I don't understand, either ♫

590
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:52,490
Fighter! Please make yourself useful!

591
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:57,750
Here you go! How am I not useful?

592
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:00,870
You call this "useful"?

593
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:05,990
Here, light up the candles! Put the candles on the cake first.

594
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:13,170
Are you upset with me that I'll be bringing the cake to Hwahwa?

595
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:14,820
Not at all.

596
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,490
Does it look like I'm upset?

597
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:26,350
Make it nice!

598
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:28,050
Yeah!

599
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:40,020
Happy Birthday to my beloved friend.

600
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:45,890
Actually, you don't have to put "friend".

601
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:48,560
What do you mean?

602
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,500
I mean what I said.

603
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:55,430
Because deep down you don't want to be just a friend, right?

604
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:58,230
- Is it not?
- It's not!

605
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:59,489
You sure?

606
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:01,680
I'm sure.

607
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:08,250
I forgot… that you never had a real friend, so how would you understand me?

608
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:11,930
Hey! Fighter!

609
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:17,170
Fighter let me go! Let me go!

610
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:25,230
Let me go!

611
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:32,930
Fighter!

612
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:39,730
I just grab a glass.

613
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:48,510
You're funny. You're scared that someone would see?

614
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:50,290
This zone has no people.

615
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:52,610
You like to tease me!

616
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:00,910
Or you think… that I would kiss you, huh, Tutor?

617
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:04,570
Silly! Who would have thought that!?

618
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:16,810
Here you go, bring it to Hwahwa.

619
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:20,550
You bring it yourself.

620
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:25,450
But she prefers you to do that.

621
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:28,600
But I don't want to, I feel achy.

622
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,890
You do it for Hwahwa!

623
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:47,160
[Happy Birthday]

624
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:49,710
Thank you, Tutor!

625
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:00,870
I wish you happiness!

626
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:28,110
Hmm… should we get back to partying? Go, go!

627
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:33,150
Come up here real quick.

628
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:35,450
Let's go!

629
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,230
Happy Birthday, Hwahwa.

630
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,140
- You...
- What?

631
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:12,530
Do you think Fight is hot?

632
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:20,500
I don't know either, but it's said that there's a theory about it.

633
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,980
Tell me.

634
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:24,910
The first one,

635
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:30,920
it's said a guy who has a wide forehead will be thick.

636
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:35,370
Thick indeed.

637
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:37,770
The second one,

638
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:43,460
a guy who has a prominent nose

639
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,120
will be big.

640
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,119
Very big.

641
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:51,520
The third one...

642
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,529
Go ahead.

643
00:50:53,529 --> 00:50:58,760
It's said a guy who has an obvious face shape...

644
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,040
will be yummy.

645
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,400
Very obvious.

646
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,810
Yummy.

647
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:08,770
Hot. I'm not done.

648
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:12,580
The last one, the fourth,

649
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:19,950
it's said you can consider from his thumb and his index finger.

650
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:22,580
- You come here too. Let's take a photo.
- Yes

651
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:26,350
Do this.

652
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:28,969
One, two...

653
00:51:28,969 --> 00:51:34,460
It's said that... it's the easiest way to see from that.

654
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,350
Thumb...

655
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:38,840
Index finger...

656
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,830
But my finger is crooked.

657
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:43,160
But I think mine is okay.

658
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:49,380
So I think Fight is...

659
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,700
nine!

660
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:58,770
So big, you girl.

661
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:00,020
Exaggerating.

662
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:03,770
But we can't say anything. He's Hwa's man.

663
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,490
But your face...

664
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,240
Your forehead,

665
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:15,170
your prominent nose...

666
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:19,869
You crazy. What's wrong with you?

667
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:23,950
It's your theory. Bitch.

668
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:30,030
Everyone, today is my birthday!

669
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:32,550
I want nothing much but you guys chug it down, please?

670
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:38,070
Cheers! Cheers! Chug it!

671
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:43,950
Fighter, cheer with me, please?

672
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:52,770
You're so cute, Fighter.

673
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:03,470
I'll be with friends, okay?

674
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:14,690
What happened?

675
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:17,910
Not enjoying?

676
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:19,129
I'm okay.

677
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:21,120
Are you okay?

678
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,420
You don't look okay.

679
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:28,990
- I'll sit with Hwahwa.
- Really?

680
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:37,149
Day, how are you so far?

681
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:39,850
Not yet, cheers?

682
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:46,629
Who mixed this for me? So strong.

683
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:50,990
Day, where are you going after this?

684
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:52,770
Going with Tutor.

685
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:34,990
Can I talk to Tutor for a bit, please?

686
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:42,529
What's wrong Hwahwa?

687
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:44,729
Are you drunk already?

688
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:49,370
I'm okay, I barely drink.

689
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:52,729
Do you want to go home? I can send you home.

690
00:54:52,729 --> 00:54:56,890
Not yet, I'm still having fun.

691
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:03,480
I don't know where Fighter has gone!

692
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:09,120
But today is my birthday and it's only one day a year.

693
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:13,290
If my friends weren't here, I would cause a drama with him.

694
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:22,530
I think he went to the toilet, no worries.

695
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:25,770
But he went for so long already, Tutor.

696
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:31,650
And…?

697
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:40,750
Please bring him back for me.

698
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:48,130
Can you do it yourself, please? I'm not close to him.

699
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:53,830
What if he's in the men's toilet,

700
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:55,540
how can I see him?

701
00:55:55,549 --> 00:55:58,780
Not sure if he's drunk and fallen on the floor already.

702
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:01,000
Please go see him for me.

703
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:05,809
I think it's not that bad, Hwahwa. Also, he's strong.

704
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:10,390
Tutor… what if something bad happened?

705
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:17,910
Please…

706
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:23,030
Okay, I'll go find him.

707
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:26,490
Be at ease.

708
00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:57,620
Fighter…

709
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,910
Fighter!

710
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:04,690
Do you hear me?

711
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:09,490
I do.

712
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:12,730
Then, why didn't you respond?

713
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:18,110
I just did.

714
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:23,910
Why are you sitting here?

715
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:32,910
I saw your friend is having a good time with her friends.

716
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:37,270
It's not necessary for me to be there.

717
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:44,410
Even so, you should be there taking care of Hwahwa, right?

718
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:49,410
I know, bro,

719
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:53,080
you two are not together yet.

720
00:57:56,730 --> 00:57:59,710
But you should be taking care of her very well, shouldn't you?

721
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:08,789
Or you actually... don't like her?

722
00:58:08,790 --> 00:58:12,909
So if you don't, then just let her go.

723
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:17,270
Like or not like, you have nothing to do with it, do you?

724
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:24,210
I have because she is my friend.

725
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:26,960
Friend?

726
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:33,610
Are you sure you think of her as a friend?

727
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:39,860
And you? Are you sure you're dating her because you're happy to,

728
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:41,870
not because you're hiding something?

729
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:45,160
Hiding?

730
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,650
What do you think I'm hiding?

731
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:51,180
I don't know, bro.

732
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:56,510
I know you talk to many women at a time.

733
00:58:56,510 --> 00:59:01,650
Besides, a player like you won't stop playing.

734
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:06,720
Or actually…

735
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:11,580
you like guys?

736
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:15,049
Tutor!

737
00:59:15,049 --> 00:59:18,570
You like guys, don't you?

738
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:22,030
What are you talking about?

739
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:23,509
You like guys.

740
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:25,310
You!

741
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:27,589
You like guys.

742
00:59:27,589 --> 00:59:29,090
Tutor!

743
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:30,929
You like guys...

744
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:33,010
I like guys?

745
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:34,830
Is it like this?

746
00:59:34,830 --> 00:59:39,310
♫ Because I believe that the love I'm looking for ♫

747
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:44,090
♫ No matter how difficult it is ♫

748
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:47,770
♫ I'm ready to accept the pain ♫

749
00:59:47,770 --> 00:59:51,110
♫ To make it meaningful ♫

750
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:54,140
♫ Because I believe in this world... ♫

751
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:56,190
Tutor, what's wrong with you?

752
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:58,760
Do you like him that much?

753
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:03,320
So you know that the Soccer Club has a singer-songwriter project between the club's members and non-members, right?

754
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:06,380
The non-member guy that got the highest score is you, Zon.

755
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:13,510
Are you tired? Can I help you?

756
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:15,300
Never mind, I can carry them.

757
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:19,070
You hold my hand again.

758
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:21,230
It's you that holds my hand.
