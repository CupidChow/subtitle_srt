1
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,020
Stop being jealous.

2
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,980
Who's jealous?

3
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,680
No one!

4
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,599
Are you sure?

5
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:38,159
Smile, please, so tomorrow will be a good day.

6
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,760
Smile, please.

7
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,040
Big smile, please.

8
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,440
Bigger, please.

9
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,699
Enough!

10
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,100
Whatever you do, it has nothing to do with me. Right?

11
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,380
You know it does.

12
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,360
If you know it does,

13
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,459
then don't be like this again.

14
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:26,220
You know that our relationship is unstable.

15
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,680
I'm being bold because of you.

16
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,660
Can't you feel it?

17
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,379
But I can see

18
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:43,540
that our relationship didn't start just like others did.

19
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,740
But tomorrow,

20
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:54,560
the beach will be our answer.

21
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,030
I can't wait until tomorrow.

22
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,279
What was that?

23
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:33,379
- Where is the luggage?
- Over there.

24
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:35,539
- I'll help you.
- Let's do it!

25
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:37,170
You!

26
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,859
Can you help me fold the clothes?

27
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,220
Here. Take this one.

28
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,239
Do you know how to do it?

29
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:06,619
I do.

30
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,420
You sure?

31
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,180
Look!

32
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,670
If you can't do it just tell me, I'll teach you.

33
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,840
Look!

34
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,639
You should do it though.

35
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,779
What?

36
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:31,619
Hey! I'll teach you how to do it so you can do it. Come.

37
00:03:31,619 --> 00:03:33,439
- It's not that difficult.
- Here. Let's try.

38
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,160
It's not that difficult?

39
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,680
You'll get better at doing it.

40
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,820
See? So easy.

41
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,519
- Am I good?
- You are.

42
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,019
Well, Fight.

43
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,279
I think I don't have a swimming suit.

44
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,179
What should I wear?

45
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,819
Maybe naked?

46
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,959
- Should I take it all off?
- Tutor!!

47
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,000
I have to take it off and go downstairs.

48
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,959
- I'll show it to you.
- It's revealing!

49
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,459
I said it's revealing!

50
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,499
- It's not.
- Tuck it in!!

51
00:04:12,499 --> 00:04:15,040
Fight!

52
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,799
Tuck it in nicely.

53
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,620
- Am I revealing?
- You are.

54
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,640
And you're not?

55
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,559
Look! It's unbuttoned.

56
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:33,379
Look! You like to show off, huh?

57
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,099
- I don't want to button up to here.
- No, you have to.

58
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:40,360
- It's uncomfortable.
- If you don't button up, I'll take off my shirt!

59
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:46,359
I'll give you a new name.

60
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,079

[Why R U - The Series]

87
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,060
I'm excited.

88
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,360
I've been to the beach many times,

89
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,080
but I've never been so excited like this.

90
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,940
Me too.

91
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,780
Hey, Tutor.

92
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,940
Can you picture the two of us in the end?

93
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,500
I have no idea.

94
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,859
But I believe and trust in it.

95
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,220
If we believe what it will turn out,

96
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,540
it will be.

97
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,040
But everything takes time.

98
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,880
And what if I tell you...

99
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,010
that I'm certain about it?

100
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,960
I'm sorry.

101
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,259
When I'm with you,

102
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,780
I just can't control myself.

103
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,400
I want to kiss you like this for a while.

104
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,480
You are quite a romantic person though.

105
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,350
I'm leaving then.

106
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,760
Get home safe.

107
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,020
Tomorrow, I'll pick you up.

108
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,630
Okay.

109
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,040
Hello.

110
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,779
If there're any document sheets, please keep them for me.

111
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:45,639
Okay. See you later.

112
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:47,920
Sure.

113
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,359
Who's that?

114
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:53,859
It's Day. He asked me where I'll be going for 4-5 days.

115
00:10:53,859 --> 00:10:58,019
You should tell him that you're going on a date with me.

116
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:00,080
You're funny!

117
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,440
Let's go.

118
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,699
Are you ready for a date, Mr. Tutor?

119
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:13,919
You don't have to be this polite. I'm not used to it.

120
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:17,699
Isn't this cute that I said it like this, Mr. Tutor?

121
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:22,139
It's cute, Mr. Koala!

122
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,629
You can call me whatever...

123
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:26,399
Babe.

124
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,280
- Fight!
- Babe.

125
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,719
You'll call me like this when we get back.

126
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:36,939
- You'll get used to it.
- I won't.

127
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:40,039
Can you get used to it for me, please?

128
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,760
We should leave now, otherwise we'll miss the flight.

129
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,299
Go. Start the engine.

130
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:46,480
Do it now.

131
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,140
- Did you smile?
- Nope.

132
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,979
Well, we've arrived.

133
00:12:21,979 --> 00:12:23,879
This is our place.

134
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:27,019
Wow! You're going all out for this?

135
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,920
You'll see.

136
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,820
See what?

137
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,340
Go! Let's go.

138
00:12:46,939 --> 00:12:48,899
Fight.

139
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:52,919
I think... that maybe we should stay at some other place.

140
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,659
This seems expensive.

141
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:57,700
We don't come here often, so we have to stay at a nice place.

142
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,939
Do you realize?

143
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:05,800
When you're making a face like this,

144
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,860
it's freaking cute.

145
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,380
- The room is ready for you, Sir.
- Okay.

146
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,160
Let's go, Fight.

147
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,479
Bring the luggage, too.

148
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:32,179
- Well done.
- Hey! What? Am I a servant?

149
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:33,760
You are.

150
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,460
Fight!

151
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,580
Fight!!

152
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,840
It's so beautiful, isn't it?

153
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,000
It is.

154
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,380
Let's get inside the room.

155
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,820
Are you really going to sleep?

156
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,539
I'm exhausted...

157
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:50,679
and sleepy too.

158
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,350
If you came here just to sleep,

159
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,779
we could've proven it at the condo instead.

160
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:59,719
You were the one who asked me out, weren't you?

161
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:03,120
So you have to let me do whatever I want.

162
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,819
I'm so sleepy right now.

163
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:07,550
Let's talk later in the evening though.

164
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:36,099
♫ I have heard before, that if we love someone ♫

165
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:46,800
♫ And if that person thinks the same, that would be happiness ♫

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:57,919
♫ The stories were not as simple as they said ♫

167
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,379
♫ If that day has come and it wasn't what I hoped for ♫

168
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:09,439
♫ I might be sad or I might lose you ♫

169
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:15,200
♫ What should I do with the truth that I'm facing? ♫

170
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:20,739
♫ What should I do with this "I love you" feeling? ♫

171
00:16:20,739 --> 00:16:26,139
♫ Even the truth was not as I expected ♫

172
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:31,179
♫ I don't know... ♫

173
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:36,659
♫ I don't know what tomorrow will be ♫

174
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:42,139
♫ Can't you feel? Can you feel that? ♫

175
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:47,599
♫ I'll let it float with the wind ♫

176

00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:58,559
♫ That my love, my love is all around you ♫

00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:03,379
♫ Can't you feel the love that I gave you? ♫

00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:08,920
♫ All of my heart is already in your hands ♫

180
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,730
Tutor.

181
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,010
Tutor!!!

182
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,220
Hey, Fatty!!!

183
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,610
Wake up.

184
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,899
Let's go and get something to eat.

185
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,539
Are you hungry?

186
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,740
Yes.

187
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,380
But I'm still sleepy.

188
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,559
I already told you.

189
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,139
Don't work too hard.

190
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,580
Tutoring me is enough.

191
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,340
Get up.

192
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,460
Go.

193
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,719
Let's wash your face.

194
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,580
Hurry.

195
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,439
Fight.

196
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,199
Is my mouth clean?

197
00:19:20,199 --> 00:19:22,859
It's already clean.

198
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:25,680
Fight, what are we eating today?

199
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,430
You'll see.

200
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,940
I'm starving. Hungry, hungry, hungry...

201
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,769
Are we there yet, Fight?

202
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:47,520
We're here.

203
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,890
Fight.

204
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,240
It's like a novel.

205
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,620
Do you like it then?

206
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:23,220
But next time you don't need to go all out like this.

207
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,820
I have more surprises for you, Tutor.

208
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,480
Let's go, I'm hungry.

209
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,030
Fight.

210
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,910
All this food looks good.

211
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,340
Do you know I eat a lot?

212
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,799
Why wouldn't I know?

213
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:26,260
I can tell by your cheeks.

214
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,220
Having chubby cheeks is cute.

215
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,610
I already warned you.

216
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:49,380
If I gain weight, don't say I didn't tell you.

217
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,070
Why aren't you eating?

218
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:12,809
Because I don't want to. I want to eat something else.

219
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:14,420
What?

220
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,250
I want to...

221
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,250
eat....

222
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,540
Fight.

223
00:22:25,548 --> 00:22:27,560
Stop making that scary face.

224
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,560
- Scary how?
- Just like you did just now.

225
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,099
If you make that face again...

226
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:34,670
I will sleep in a separate room.

227
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,410
I'm hungry, too.

228
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:40,200
But what can I do...

229
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,610
if the eye candy is more appealing.

230
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,830
Are we fighting? Are we fighting?

231
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,720
Let's eat... now.

232
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,720
Eat.

233
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,510
Eat or not?

234
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,379
Not eating right?

235
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,960
Fight.

236
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,230
Eat.

237
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,840
Stop looking, just eat.

238
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,520
Want more?

239
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,470
♫ Because I believe there will be someone in this world ♫

240
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:39,590
♫ who can fill my heart ♫

241
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:46,230
♫ Although I'm going to fall apart at the end ♫

242
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:50,390
♫ I'm ready ♫

243
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,920
Fight.

244
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:58,100
I think you're a romantic person.

245
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,899
Fight, do you know?

246
00:24:03,899 --> 00:24:08,000
I love this kind of atmosphere.

247
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,960
It reminds me of my parents.

248
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,620
I used to be so happy.

249
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,150
When I went on picnics with my parents.

250
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,280
Thank you.

251
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,280
Fight, how did you know I would like this?

252
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,639
Because I am awesome.

253
00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:33,209
Don't do it too often okay?

254
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,090
Why?

255
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,690
Because if you do something like this all the time,

256
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:40,120
I will get addicted to you.

257
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,560
Fight, where are you going?

258
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,000
- Nowhere.
- Are you shy?

259
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:56,179
Just say it if you are shy.

260
00:24:56,179 --> 00:24:57,739
I'm not shy.

261
00:24:57,739 --> 00:25:00,199
Not shy.

262
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:05,730
I think... tonight we should sleep separately.

263
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,650
Sleep separately?

264
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,260
Why?

265
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,600
I'm afraid, I might break my promise.

266
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,770
We haven't decided to be in a relationship yet.

267
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,530
Fight.

268
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,749
Fight, do you know...

269
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,190
Before I decided to come...

270
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,010
I had been thinking a lot.

271
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,850
Thinking about... how others might see us.

272
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,220
How they are going to judge us.

273
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,170
Or if we are doing the right thing.

274
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:52,030
Maybe I'm being sensitive and it has started to affect my feelings.

275
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,700
By just the two of us coming here...

276
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,490
it looks strange in other people's eyes.

277
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,440
In my life...

278
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,719
I have always taken care of other people.

279
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:09,480
But right now,

280
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,630
I think this is my time.

281
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,550
Because I feel really happy for the first time in a long time.

282
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,640
And, Fight, do you know

283
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,130
what the reason for my happiness is?

284
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,220
It's because I like you, Fight.

285
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,909
Also, I want to be close to you.

286
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,260
- Tutor.
- Yeah?

287
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,760
Are you not feeling well?

288
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,860
I'm feeling fine.

289
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,859
- Fight.
- You don't have a fever?

290
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:08,840
Are you trying to be funny?

291
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,359
Why? You didn't think I could say something nice?

292
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:15,040
Yep.

293
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,620
Fight.

294
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:24,920
Sometimes, I think my life feels like a novel.

295
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,340
Zon once told me...

296
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:32,220
He and I had fallen into a novel.

297
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,069
I think it's good.

298
00:27:36,069 --> 00:27:38,220
If I'm living in a novel,

299
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:45,850
perhaps it might be better than our real life.

300
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,610
I'll cheer for you.

301
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,820
Thank you.

302
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,740
Well, today,

303
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:10,000
I'm going to sleep next to you.

304
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:12,730
Okay?

305
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,550
Is that okay?

306
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,770
Aren't you stiff in this position?

307
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,440
If this position gives aches,

308
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,240
then you can sleep right here.

309
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:47,270
Then... I'll snooze for a bit, okay?

310
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:50,209
If you feel sleepy, you can wake me up.

311
00:28:50,209 --> 00:28:51,389
Okay?

312
00:28:51,389 --> 00:28:54,090
- Okay.
- Then we can go back to our room.

313
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,459
Okay.

314
00:28:55,459 --> 00:28:57,360
Well, where do you want me to lay down?

315
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,600
Let's move over here.

316
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,899
Scoot here.

317
00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:05,200
I'm scooting.

318
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:16,100
♫ I can no longer stop my heart ♫

319
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:22,650
♫ Because inside my heart, it's full of love ♫

320
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:25,670
♫ I loved you from that day, but I have to hide it ♫

321
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,610
Fight!

322
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:36,260
Did we sleep till morning?

323
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,399
Why didn't you wake me up?

324
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,749
I saw you were enjoying it, I didn't want to bother you.

325
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,850
Are you shy?

326
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,649
I'm not shy.

327
00:29:46,649 --> 00:29:48,349
Yes, you are. I can tell.

328
00:29:48,349 --> 00:29:50,520
No, I'm not.

329
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,090
Your hair is all messed up now.

330
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:58,890
- Go.
- I'm not shy.

331
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,030
Hurry up.

332
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,000
Where are we going today?

333
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
How about we stroll around the town and take pictures.

334
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
In the afternoon,

335
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,800
if we have nothing to do, we can go to the island.

336
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,400
Can we go to the "island (koh)" like this?
(T/N: "Koh" in Thai is same pronounce as the word "clingy")

337
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,800
Are you trying to be cute? I mean, clinging like this, can't I?

338
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,700
Are you trying to be cute?

339
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,000
We are going to take a stroll on the island.

Fight, do you know?

354
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,200
I really love nature.

You've been hugging me.

359
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,400
I'm not tired of being like this.

360
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,520
- Is it beautiful?
- Yeah.

361
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,200
Tutor.

362
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,600
- What is it Fight?
- Let's play in the water.

363
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,800
I don't want to. I want to play tomorrow.

364
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,200
Please?

365
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,400
Get wet with me.

366
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,600
If you want to play, go ahead.

367
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
Please...

368
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,600
I want to take a picture, okay?

369
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,400
- I'll go ahead and play then.
- Okay.

370
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,300
Are you really not going to?

371
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,800
Bye-bye.

372
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,400
Bye-bye.

373
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,300
Do you think you have a great body, Fight?

374
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,400
Show off!

375
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,200
I'm very protective of what's mine, do you know?

376
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,600
Tutor.

377
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,000
What happened?

378
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Ouch, Fight. Don't touch it.

379
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,400
I don't know what pierced my foot.

380
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:39,500
- Why did you hit me?
- Why didn't you take better care of yourself, huh?

381
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,800
Fight.

382
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,200
Does it hurt?

383
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,800
Don't scold me.

384
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,400
I haven't realized what happened to me yet.

385
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,600
Why shouldn't I?

386
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,400
Next time, wear shoes.

387
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,500
Don't you know I'm worried?

388
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,300
Come.

389
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,000
Get up!

390
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,600
Hurry... Get up!

391
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,300
Come. Get on!

392
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,000
What are you doing?

393
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,800
Giving you a piggyback ride.

394
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,200
You're acting like a hero in a novel.

395
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,000
Hurry up and get on.

396
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,400
Hurry.

397
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,400
One.

398
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,700
You're stubborn.

399
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,600
Naughty.

400
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,600
Tutor, what are you doing?

401
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,700
Nothing, Fight.

402
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,400
I am looking for the bandage that you bought.

403
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,700
Have a seat, I'll get it.

404
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,200
Walk carefully.

405
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,700
You are really stubborn.

406
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,400
Your cut is as small as a sea shell.

407
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,100
You act like your leg got amputated.

408
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,100
You overreacted first.

409
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,000
How did I overreact?

410
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
You sat there looking all hurt with a sulky face.

411
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,800
I didn't know what cut my foot.

412
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,400
Why don't you take better care of yourself?

413
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,800
You always make me worried.

414
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,600
Be gentle.

415
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:57,920
It hurts.

416
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,040
Hey.

417
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,000
Stay still.

418
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,700
Almost done.

419
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,000
You always make me worry about you.

420
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,400
Do you want to feel better?

421
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,400
Fight.

422
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,800
Fight, what are you doing?

423
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,700
Do you know?

424
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:55,600
Coming here with me is not just about eating...

425
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,800
or having a good time.

426
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,180
You know, right?

427
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:14,750
Enough kissing, Tutor.

428
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:45,300
You should go take a shower, Tutor.

429
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:57,670
Fight...

430
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,040
You make me yearn for it...

431
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:07,510
and then you leave.

432
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:14,120
I already saw what you bought, Fight.

433
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,980
Are you ready, Tutor?

434
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,889
Ready, Tutor.

435
00:44:38,889 --> 00:44:41,070
Come closer to me.

436
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:09,840
We belong to each other, right?

437
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:14,770
Next time, I won't give in.

438
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:22,580
But... are you okay?

439
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:47,690
I'm concerned about you, Tutor.

440
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:10,020
I won't do it again.

441
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,960
I promise.

442
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,830
I don't want us to get bored with each other.

443

I love you, Tutor.

444
